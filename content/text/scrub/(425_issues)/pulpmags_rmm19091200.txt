told before hitting the hay

by olin crawford

its a rough clay that doesnt have a storyand a tired man who isnt ready
to hear or tell one  ear-pounding  is a pleasant occupation but it
needs a good frame of mind to get the best out of it therefore where
two or three railroad men are gathered together in one bunk-house the strain
of the days toil is relieved by that oldest and most honorable of all barters
swapping yarns- stove-piping to use the term that every railroad man
understands

    these bunk-house tales bear this stamp-the hall-mark of the road a
nerve-racking incident is laughed over and through sheer relief men who
were almost flagged by the black flag of death tell a tale with as much gusto
as the head shack when he romances about the hoboes he made hit the dirt

here we have the inevitable black cat the empty air-brakes the
dago ghosts the man with the hawk eyes the vision
of snyder and others

lont suppose any of you
boys remember n ick
ferguson said jim
ronney as he sat with
his feet on the empty
checker-board table in
the eries bunk-house in the jersey city
yards ronney quit running a freight-
engine when he fell heir to a little
property a few years ago and lie hasnt
had much to do since but to talk about
the old days

  he shot an inquiring glance at the
circle of men from the engines - men
whose eyes seemed preternaturally large
and bright in their wreaths of dust and
 rr	

soot as they lounged around the tables
in the big dark room on the ground
floor in the shadow of the roundhouse
walls

   i guess not said ronney noting
the general shaking of heads  he
hasnt been on the road since the civil
war and i havent seen or heard of
him in forty years

   the first work  ever did was firing
on his engine and of all the super-
stitious old boys i ever fell in with
he certainly held the record that black
cat that sneaked through here just now
put me in mind of him you know
people have got different theories about
	the railroad

black cats some of em think theyre
good luck and some think theyre bad

   ferguson was dead set against em
he couldnt abide the sight of one and
 can swear he used to actually turn pale
whenever one of em came near him

   ft was about s as near as  can
recollect that we were starting out on
our run one morning andhewas look-
ing- pretty gloomy and not saying much
finally  said nick whats the mat-
ter with you this morning

   he didnt give so much as a word
in answer but kept looking out of the
cab and watching the track ahead  and
i made up my mind that if he was go-
ing to act that way i wouldnt bother
with him and kept quiet

   but after about five minutes he
turned and looked at me as solemn as
an owl then he says  jim some-
things going to happen to us before we
get back

  whats the matter this time i
says i wasnt worrying much for hed
made that prediction before without its
coming true

     well he says  one of those black
devils came and sat on the porch of my
house up in elmira last evening and
yowled there all night that means
death a cousin of mine in port jervis
had a black cat come to his house and
act the same way a year ago and the
next day he dropped dead of apoplexy
you may laugh but i tell you theres
something in that superstition

didnt believe in black cats

   of course i didnt take any stock
in such a fool idea as that and after
wed run along for an hour or so it
was pretty near out of my mind except
that nick brought it back to me now
and then by his worried look

   we were to the west of shohola
pulling half a dozen freight-cars and
making pretty good time when we came
to a switch as it turned out later the
switchman was drunk what did we do
but run out onto the siding with a lone
caboose standing right ahead of us not
a hundred feet away

   i lit out for the open air without
another look and landed sprawling in
a sand-pile without so much as a scratch

mans magazine

                  a

 i had no more than struck the ground
 than i saw nick coming too but as
 he jumped his foot caught on the cab
 and tilted him forward and he turned
 a complete somersault in the air and
 landed on his feet it was as pretty a
 stunt as i ever saw in a circus

    hed waited just long enough to
 shut off steam but the engine banged
 into that caboose and tore it all to
 pieces besides getting pretty well
 smashed up itself the two brakemen
 had jumped too and neither of em was
 much hurt but it- was as close a call
 as any of us had ever had

   nick t says the next time any
 black cats come yowling round your
 house you kill em i dont want any
 more experiences like this

   didnt i tell you he says

     yes i says  you told me it meant
 death but i never heard a black cat
 meant any such circus stunt as youve
 been performing

     dont be too sure he says  im
 getting along in years i may have hurt
 myself internally doing that somer-
 sault

    you never can cure a man who was
 as superstitious as he was

running into danger

    ive known men whose premonitions
 did come true and they werent super-
 stitious either said harvey spring-
 stead who had just come in from mogul
  and whose days as an erie engineer
 date back to 

    when it comes really down to the
 supernatural the story about amos
 beattie is the strangest i ever heard he
 was running along with a passenger-
 train at high speed near the top of the
 oxford grade when the words came into
 his mind  theres danger ahead

    he was behind time and if he
 slowed down without good reason it
 might mean trouble for him at the end
 of the run but he couldnt get the idea
 out of his head that he was running into
 danger and just before he came to a
 curve where the woods were thick and
 he couldnt see ahead he shut off steam
 and put on the air

    everybody wondered why he did it
 for they hadnt seen any sign of trouble
told before hitting the hay

us 

he used to actually turn pale whenever one
of em came near him

but lie had no sooner come to
a stop than there on the curve
only a few feet away was a
caboose - the rear end of a
blocked train if it hadnt been
for that mysterious warning

beattie would have smashed
into it and nobody knows how
many lives would have been
lost

   it was on the oxford
grade too that ed reeds
freight-train ran awav with him
a few years ago up at the top
of the mountain reed had left
his brake-valve handle switched
around  on the lap and grad-
ually all the air had leaked out
of the tanks

   coming down the grade
theres a fall of almost ninety
feet to the mile you can
imagine that when he struck it
he began to get up speed with
fifty or sixty heavy freight-cars
behind him he was running
altogether too fast for safety so
he grabbed his brake-valve and
found it wasnt working

   that scared him and he
switched jt around to emer-
gency still nothing doing
not air enough to make a
sound and the old train was
getting up more and more speed
every second

   they used to say reeds hair stood
right up on end when he found his air
had gone he began to scramble back
toward the cars and the brakemen when
they realized what was up tried to put
on the hand-brakes but they wouldnt
hold somehow and away the train went
at a tremendous clip with pretty near
two miles of down grade ahead of it
and with only about one chance in a
hundred of holding to the rails

   i dont -suppose anybody ever had
any notion of what speed it reached but
it was a good guess that it was the fast-
est freight that ever ran on the road
talk about your eighteen-hours-to-chi-
cago trains they wouldnt have been
in it for a minute with ed reeds fast
freight

   it came down the mountain like a
streak of lightning with ed hanging on-

to his cab and wondering how soon he
was going to another world the train-
crew was yellin and thinkin they were
never going to see home again and then
a minute later ahead of em on the same
track they got sight of another freight

a quick-witted despatcher

   it looked as if it was all up with
em then the other freight was under
way and was going the same direction
they were but it was down at the bot-
tom of the grade and even if its engi-
neer had seen them coming he never
could have worked up enough speed to
run away from them but as it hap-
pened he hadnt any idea that there was
such a flier behind him and he was just
crawling along 

just then in the nick of time the


the railroad mans magazine

despatcher at chester saw reed coming
he knew he wouldnt be driving along
at that speed unless something was
wrong and he made up his mind what
to do in a flash

    it happened that there wasnt any-
thing on the east-bound track just then
and he swung the switch to turn reeds
train over onto it

  a few seconds laterthe runaway
came pounding along to the cross-overs
it was pretty doubtful whether it would
hold the rails between tracks going at
such a speed and with so many cars but
it did somehow and brought up on the
east-bound track safe and sound but

	it ran along beyond that point almost a
mile on the up grade before reed could
stop it

    if it had been a little later there
would have been a chance of a head-on
collision for an east - bound train was
soon due its a pretty safe guess that
reed never kept his brake - valve open
after that

   but to come back to those super-
stitious people did you ever hear why
jim farrington once quit his job about
fifteen years ago twelve italians were
killed in a wreck at iiohokus

the hohokus ghosts

    farrington was baggage - master on
my train then and he was inclined to
be superstitious some of us had heard
he believed in ghosts so we fixed up a
job to test him the night after the
wreck when we came to the place where
it had happened i slowed down a little
bit and then one of the brakemen let
out a yell the next minute farrington
was running around wanting to know
what all the trouble was about

the trouble said somebody

 isnt there trouble enough when you see
the ghosts of twelve italians all waving
at you at once  

    farrington quit running on that line
after that night fie said twelve dago
ghosts all in a bunch were too much for
the nerves of any man

   a little later levi linley came into
the bunk-house pie has been running
an engine on the erie for forty-one
years and was a brakeman as long ago
as 

  ever see a ghost levi asked a
young fireman

    i cant say that i have said lin-
ley as he poured his coffee into the in-
verted cover of his dinner-pail  my
engine has struck a good many men but
they dont haunt me nights the only
one that ever came anywhere near it was
a man i ran over up the other side of
chester nine or ten years ago

   i was just running out of the sta-
tion and going not more than six or
eight miles an hour when i noticed him
walking alongside the track he was a
man about thirty-five i should say and
looked pretty seedy he and the engine
were going in the same direction and i
didnt pay much attention to him until
he stopped of a sudden turned his head
and looked me straight in the eye

eyes of a hawk

    he had an eye as sharp as a hawks
and somehow that look of his seemed
to go clear through me i never want
to see as much in another mans eyes as
i saw in his that moment ive heard
of magnetic eyes and soulful eyes and
eyes that spoke volumes but the eyes
that man turned on me nobody would
ever forget they sent a creepy feeling
right up and down my spine

   the next second what did he do
but kneel down on the track stretch his
hands out in front of him and put his
head across the rail

   i looked the other way ive seen
dozens of men killed but i couldnt
stand that not after those eyes had bored
through me and i couldnt go back to
see what was left of him either the
only man i ever struck that i didnt go
back to see afterward

    i can see those eyes now and some-
times  see em nights too if i ever
have a nightmare ill be dreaming that 
man is standing by the track looking
at me

   it turned out that he had been to
greycourt the evening before had spent
his last twenty-five cents there for some-
thing to eat and had gone away saying
he was down and out

    its lucky i dont believ i ghosts or
i might imagine i saw him in front of the
engine some night this ghost talk is
told before hitting the hay



all bosh but in the half
century that ive been on
the railroad ive run with
a good many men that be-
lieved in em

  twenty years or so ago
a brakeman named snyder
was killed at whites
bridge near otisville the
next night when we were
running by there the men
on my train were pretty
near scared to death they
imagined they saw snyder
sitting on the wall at the
end of the bridge waving
his hand at them

   a few nights later at
the same place the brake-
men got another scare

there was snyder on the
wall again they said beck-
oning to them one of
them gave a yell you could
have heard a mile away

   but i hadnt seen any-
thing myself and i never

did	though for months af-
terward the brakemen run-
ning by there used to think
they saw the ghost sitting
on the wall

   about the worst scare
i ever had didnt come from
ghosts it was one day in
the early sixties while we
were running near the del-
aware bridge it was a
cattle-train in one car
there were twenty-five oxen

we were going along at a
pretty good clip when the
engine jumped the track
dragging the nearest cars
into the ditch

   alongside the ditch
there was a stone wall about
eight feet high i was a
brakeman in those days
and was riding in the ca-
boose when the smash
came i was pitched clear over that wall
and landed on my hands and knees with-
out much more than a scratch

   i had no sooner struck the ground
than an ox came diving through the air
above the wall looking something like

the pictures of the cow that jumped over
the moon and landing on all fours al-
most on top of me it had been thrown
right through the roof of one of the cars
and why it wasnt killed or at least hurt
i never could understand


the railroad mans magazine

  sometimes m m rounds one of the
oldest railroad men in the country
strolls down lo the erie yards from his
home in jersey city he goes back to
the dim old days of the strap-iron rails

in  he was running an engine on the
erie in  he was in maryland as
one of the contractors who were build-
ing the southern maryland road

  after thirty miles had been built the
roads backers ran short of
funds and in  rounds
became an engineer on the
missouri pacific three
years more and he was back-
running an engine on the
erie again many a story
this old engineer tells of
railroading in the fifties

wondering how soon he

was going to another
world

when the telegraph played only a very
small part in railroading two years
ago the erie retired him on a pension
after he had served the company twenty-
nine years as an engineer

  rounds was born on march  
and it was in  that he became a
railroad man in that year he went to
work in the boston locomotive works
and helped to build some of the famous
engines of the time in  he went to
the boston and providence as a car-re-
pairer and in  became an engineer
on the hartford providence and fish-
kin with a run between willimantic and
bristol

  in  he became an engineer on the
new york new haven and hartford
three years later he was in charge of
the engine- repair-shops at new haven

he was on one of the engines that ran
through the famous blizzard of 
one of the worst snow-storms that ever
struck new england

   railroading through the storm of
 was bad enough hesaid but it
was a good deal worse in  when
the snow was just as deep and the en-
gines smaller i was in charge of the
told before hitting the hay



engine repair-shops then and in the
height of the storm  ran out from new
haven with one of the engineers

   there wasnt any telegraph system
then worth mentioning and the road was
only a single track the train that was
due to meet us didnt come so we ran
on past the switch intending to go as
far as we could until we met either that
train or some other one the engineer
was worrying he wasnt sure just what
he ought to do

   the only rules to guide an engineer
at that time were printed on the backs
of the time-tables and they didnt pro-
vide for many emergencies it was risky
business too running on a single track
and not knowing where the other trains
were but of course w didnt run very-
fast even under the best of conditions
a ttain didnt often average more than
twenty miles an hour in those days

   at last we met not only one train
but six all together the engineer of
the first train insisted that we must run
back and get out of his way but an-
other train had run up behind us and
the engineer of that shouted out  i
wont back a foot not for the presi-
dent of the road

   well they began to argue and were
getting pretty mad about it when the
superintendent of the road who had
been on one of the six trains ahead of
us came running up and cried out that
we had the right of way because we were
on time and the trains ahead of us
werent

in the single-track days

   so all those six trains had to run
back and let us move on of course it
took them a good deal longer than it
would have taken us and we would
probably have got ahead faster if we
had run back to a switch and let them
pass us but it was a matter of pride
which should get out of the way the
question of which way would delay the
passengers the most didnt enter into the
question

   ive known engineers to meet on
that pld single track and stop head-on
only a few feet apart and begin arguing
over which ones watch was right

one of em would call out now

look a here my watch hasnt lost ten
minutes in a week and i set it by the
town clock only this morning im here
right on time and by thunder youve
got to back out

   then the other one would begin to
tell about how his watch was guaran-
teed and theyd keep on arguing until
one or the other would get tired and get
out of the way

correct time not kept

   nobody had perfect time in those
days and one of the rules of the road
was that we should wait at a station
five minutes to allow for differences be-
tween watches

   queer how there werent more acci-
dents isnt it but they didnt have
half as many big disasters as we have
nowadays i suppose the worst that
new england ever had in those early
years was the one at the south norwalk
drawbridge when the draw was closed
a red ball hung over the bridge if the
ball wasnt in sight it meant that the
draw was open

   but one day in  an engineer at
the head of a big passenger-train ran out
into the open draw at full speed when
the ball was down the engine and
three cars went into the river and the
only reason the rest didnt follow was
that there wasnt room left in the draw
for them to squeeze through forty
persons were drowned in that accident
and a good many of them were from
some of the best families in new eng-
land

   nobody could understand why the
engineer had run out onto the bridge
when the ball was down and he didnt
live to explain many times after that
i ran a train over the same bridge my-
self and i used to wonder what it was
that could have led to such a foolish blun-
der

   and at last one day i solved the
mystery-solved it to my own satisfac-
tion at least and other people on the
road agreed with me just in line with
the red ball i caught sight of the top
of a red chimney a few yards back from
the end of the bridge with the sun in
a mans eyes he could easily have taken
that chimney-top for the ball itself i
the railroad mans magazine

 they saw snyder sitting on the wall
at the end of the bridge waving
his hand

havent the least doubt that that chim-
ney was responsible for that wreck

  when it comes to queer accidents
there is the adventure of clark caskey
who runs the eries engine no 
caskey is one of the very old-timers too
way back in  he was a brakeman
on the erie and throughout most of the
civil war he was running an engine on
the atlantic and great western in
 he came back to the erie and has
been an engineer on that road ever
since

what clark caskey told

   it was in the early sixties said cas-
key  that i was running a little west
of meadville pennsylvania pulling a
train of oil-cars they didnt have oil-
cars then such as we have to-day the
oil was carried in big wooden tubs we
were running toward a switch which
for some reason or other and unknown

to me or the crew had
been left open

   that sent us flying
onto the side-track where
a freight-car was stand-
ing it was too late to
prevent a smash and we
went crashing into it
the fireman and i and
most of the crew jumped
just in time and landed
unhurt on the other side
of the ditch

  the collision knocked
one of the tubs open in
the car behind the engine
and sent a stream of oil
right out over the boiler
in  another second the
engine and the whole
train was ablaze from
end to end

   we had no more
than seen the fire flash
along the cars than there
ran past us up the slope
a human torch-a man
who was ablaze from
head to foot and who
left a trail of fire behind
him in the wind as he ran

   he was fred hill
the head brakeman i
hope i shall never see another sight
such as that

   he ran as fast as he could through
the open fields until he came to a mud-
-hole he dove into it and rolled
around in the mud till the fire was out
he lay there until we came up and
dragged him to his feet

   it seemed for a time as if he would
recover but- he had inhaled the flames
and didnt live but a day or two

  often among the old-timers tales are
told of engineers who have long been in
their graves engineers whose names were
known to thousands of railroad men in
their day and whose memories are still
kept green

  such a man was charlie leonard a
good many men still living used to be
his friends one of them is tom shaw
the brakeman on the greenwood lake
division who used to run on the same
train with him tom shaw was a brake-
man bark in civil war days and when
told before  hitting the hay



he was twelve years old he was running
messages for j e dunning the head
operator on the eries eastern division

   leonard was the man who hung
onto his tank with a broken leg all the
way down shonkum mountain said
shaw  a side rod on his engine broke
and knocked a hole through the floor of
his cab it broke his leg and knocked
him back against the tank

   then it went thrashing around
through the cab so that he couldnt have
come back to it if he had been able lie
saved himself from going clear out to
the ground by grabbing the edge of the
tank and there he hung for five miles
till the brakeman discovered him

   on the old twenty-one passenger
leonard had a brakeman named frank
fox- and a man named russell was con-
ductor fox dreamed one night that he
saw himself lying beside the track dead
russell had been a watchmaker and it
happened that fox had a watch that be-
longed to him

   the morning after his dream he
told his mother that if anything hap-
pened to him she should send the watch
to russell he told her he was afraid
he wasnt going to come back alive

   in the evening fox came to the
train for the night run part of the
way he rode in the baggage-car there
was no light there and both side-doors
were open fox was riding there all
alone when he pitched out of one of the
side-doors and went under the wheels

   leonard was-a man who used to
have queer dreams too one night he
told the boys that he had dreamed he
had heard his friend red rickey the
flagman crying  good-by charlie
youve done for me

   that dream seemed to have scared
him for he was nervous when he started
out on the night run and kept saying he
was afraid something would happen

   well something did happen it
was up beyond turner and they were
not very far from where rickey lived
that leonard noticed a man walking
the ties ahead of him it was midwinter
snow was falling  the track was slippery

   leonard blew his whistle and the
man turned his head looked at the en-
gine and waited until it was almost on
top of him before starting to get off

the track then as he was stepping
over the rail he slipped and went sprawl-
ing the next second the engine was
over him

   when -the train had come to a stop
leonard got out and walked back with
the rest to look at the man he had
killed when he got to the spot the
body was lying in the snow by the side
of the track and somebody was holding
a lantern so that the light fell full in
the mans face

   leonard gave one look and turned
away with a hoarse shout it was red
rickey he had killed

   that was the only time anybody
ever saw charlie leonard scared he
was as white as snow all the rcfst of
the night and his hands were shaking so
that lie could hardly pull the lever

   the way harry dexter met his
death always seemed queer to me too
he was running on the greenwood lake
division at the time and the following
day he was to be transferred to the main
line he came down the meadows to the
snake hill draw - bridge and the day
was clear as a bell and all the signals
were set ahead of him to show the draw
was open

   but he kept right on at full speed
and toppled into the river there were
five other men on- the engine with him
and they all jumped into the water and
swam ashore dexter jumped too but
the heel of his shoe caught on one of the
ties and he fell forward and broke his
skull against the trestle

  it was a passenger-train he had been
pulling and there were fifteen passen-
gers aboard when the cars all went pi-
ling into the water for some unknown
reason the stay chains hadnt been fast-
ened to hold the cars on the trucks i f
they had been the heavy trucks would
have dragged them to the bottom as it
was the cars floated and the passengers
were all saved the only one killed in
the wreck was dexter himself

   now why was it that an experienced
engineer like him could run at full speed
into an open draw when all the signals
were set and the day was bright and
clear the men who were in the en-
gine with him never could explain it
they said that dexter at the time had
been looking straight at the signals too
  the dynamite division

by dennis h stovall

some of the unusual as well as unfortunate things that have come
to pass while hauling the high explosive
in the far west

        unning through northern
 i  	california and southern

oregon is a section of
he southern pacific main
jfcline that railroaders have
appropriately dubbed the
 dynamite division possibly no other
section of railroad in america has known
more accidents thjjl-tlois-pertieft of the
southgiiv-p-afiltc and it should be
-ftearly understood that there is not one
lone anarchist on the entire  dynamite
division

    this part of the southern pacific
  snakes over the great siskiyou range on
  the oregon - california line and the
  coast mountains of southern oregon
  a vast amount of dynamite is used in
  the mines of the district and a still
  greater amount is hauled over the line
  to more northern points for excavating
  purposes nearly every freight - train
  has one or more dynamite - cars in its
  string and some trains are loaded almost
  entirely with the explosive

    to reduce the danger of handling and
  moving it to the lowest possible mini-
  mum nitroglycerin which supplies the
  explosive quality of dynamite is mixed
  with infusorial earth the silicious
  earth simply absorbs and holds the liquid
  and also diminishes its sensitiveness
  besides absorbing it and reducing its
  sensitiveness the earth also allows the
  dynamite to be manufactured into con-
  venient sticks

    these sticks are the size and shape of
  ordinary candles and are packed in
  twenty-five and fifty-pound boxes in
  shipping these boxes are piled one upon
  the other in ordinary freight-cars

  where the cars are completely filled
the danger of explosion is less than when
the cars are only partially filled a
long freight - train with three cars of
dynamite in its middle was speeding
down the grade through cow creek
canon in the coast mountains near-
ing a tunnel the engineer applied the
air the train slowed suddenly one
of the dynamite-cars was only half filled
and the sudden checking slid the boxes
forward

a real explosion

  they came up hard against the end
wall the dynamite in all three cars
exploded simultaneously the shock
that followed was terrific towns thirty-
miles away trembled as if by an earth-
quake

  the two big locomotives drawing the
train were shot through the tunnel like
a stone from a catapult except a few
near the tail all of the cars were re-
duced to atoms and the particles hurled
for miles every vestige of the cars
containing the dynamite completely dis-
appeared fortunately the crew was at
each end of the train and escaped with
bruises only

  the main force of this explosion was
upward the canon walls were stripped
of trees and brush at the top of the
precipice overlooking the canon and a
mile from the railroad a hammock was
swung between two trees a woman lay
in the hammock idly reading when the
explosion occurred she was hurled into
the air and dropped unhurt among the
vines and dense growth near by
the dynamite division



  a few months later another freight-
train with two cars of dynamite in its
string met a similar fate at almost the
same point in cow creek canon one
of the cars was derailed and it was the
jolting over the ties that shook the dyna-
mite and caused the explosion this
train was a worse wreck two brake-
men who were  on deck  were killed

  there were several cars of lemons on
this train and railroaders solemnly af-
firm that it rained lemons for a week
following the explosion up on top the
mountainabove the canon a prospector
had built his cabin he was frying flap-
jacks when the explosion occurred and
was surprised when a fifty-pound section
of steel car-plate came down his chimney

  as a protection against careless loaf-
ers each car containing dynamite is
posted with big placards these convey
the information that the car contains a
dangerous explosive and warns loafers
against passing the time in its vicinity 
but the big black-lettered warning is
now and then overlooked by the careless
on the dynamite division

  in one notable instance two cars so
placarded were used as a target by three
small boys who were anxious to test the
shooting qualities of a newly purchased
rifle they were shooting at the letter
 s  on the car the boy who tried
first missed by a narrow margin the
next boy came a little closer and the
third boy hit it in the center-at least
it is presumed lie did from what fol-
lowed

  the two cars of dynamite exploded
and not only the three boys but a half
dozen bystanders were killed not enough
of their bodies being found to make one

burial the little california town was
almost wiped off the map and traffic de-
moralized for two precious days

  in the several accidents that have
occurred the freakish nature of the ex-
plosive has been clearly exemplified
dynamite will not ignite or explode
from a blaze some miners have a play-
ful habit of lighting sticks of the powder
just lo see it burn if all conditions
are favorable it will burn quietly with
a blue flame and a slight sputter

  it is supposed to explode only when
subjected to a severe shock and in using
it this shock is produced by a percussion-
cap containing fulminating mercury
but there have been instances in hauling
the explosive over the  dynamite divi-
sion  when it failed to explode after
getting a pretty severe jolt

  near grants pass oregon the north-
bound overland running at high speed
crashed into the rear end of a freight
that had failed to take the siding the
two locomotives drawing the passenger
plowed through the caboose and into
three cars of dynamite not only the
cars containing it but the boxes of ex-
plosive were broken to bits the sticks
were bruised and mashed flat some were
thrown hundreds of feet yet no explo-
sion occurred

  the best  powder experts  fail to
explain why the dynamite did not ignite
two hundred people on the overland
and three thousand persons in grants
pass were sincerely glad it did not

  considering the vast amount of dan-
gerous explosives hauled over the  dyna-
mite division the southern pacific does
well to transport the stuff with as few
accidents as do occur
my sweethearts an engineer

by kittie spargur hulse

a song written for the railroad mans magazine

ou may sing if you like of the boys in blue
in a song that will move to tears

i sing of those heroes so brave and true-
god bless them our engineers

              and i love to ride down the shining line

               in the smoky old cab so dear

              while die red flames roar through the furnace-door
                with my sweetheart the engineer

      refrain-my sweethearts an engineer

                   and its proud i am of him

                    and theres never a pleasure i hold so dear
                    as a ride in the cab with jim

 his face may be grimy his soul is white

               his honest gray eyes are clear

              my jims all right in one gills sight

               though hes only an engineer

              and if ever hes needed youll find him there
               although it may cost him dear

              hell wait by the lever and stand by the air-

               my sweetheart the engineer
he omitted the extra

         by james norman shreve

    what happened when pusher  with redding at
    the throttle thought she had the right of way

he timekeeper struggled
feverishly for several mo-
ments to catch at least a
few of the letters that were
sprayed out in what seemed
to him a hysterical blur of
dots and dashes from the white deft fin-
gers of alfred winter second-trick des-
patcher of the pecos valley lines

  finally a breath of the cool june night
breeze from the open window behind
him doubled over the sheet of clip he
was writing on and he lost track of the
meanings he shook his head threw
down his pencil
and leaned back
watching admi-
ringly the swift
work of the des-
patcher

 in a moment
the latter closed
his key looked up
at the clock and
jotted down
  p on the
train-sheet then
he smiled thinly
at the timekeeper

   get any

  the
grinned

ly oh some

 got  c  e all
right and an  as-
sist  and extra
and-sj e t  s see-

 over all and
trains gee

you must have
gone at a sixty-a-
minute hike

   hardly that about forty-five
farquehar at canadian isnt a fast man
here he comes with the repeat try it
he sends slow

   the timekeeper grabbed his pencil and
again bent over his pad when the des-
patcher handed the train-order copy-book
over the long glass partition to korbv
browning his young night operator the
timekeeper walked around and peered
over korbys shoulder for a moment
he compared his slip with the book
then he slapped his leg explosively
by gracious his voice was tri-
umphant  look-a
here 

  he shoved the
paper under kor-
bys nose

   what do you
think of that now
say only whisper
to me friends-
only whisper i see
your finish kor-
by me for your
job all right all
right say the
word alfred and
you can have me
the despatcher
threw liis thin
ungenial smile at
the operator
 get it did he
korby nodded
 sure thing all
except the date
he got up and of-
fered his chair to
the timekeeper
 here you are


the railroad mans magazine

shervin i resign youre it when you
get alfreds job there ginnne mine back
will you he reached for his pipe
 got a match 

  shervin carefully folded his sheet of
paper  this is a precious thing in
future years i shall look upon its frayed
and worn edges and say to one k
browning still a struggling operator
tolerated in my office  young man re-
member that  why oh why havent
you taken a leaf out of my book   

  he handed over the match  well
i gotta go to bed night both bet
you  dream of head-end collisions no
 in the ditch forty people passed in
their checks-and me asleep at the key 
the night operator at canadian sat
for a moment staring at the train-order
pad before him a shaggy frown roofing
his tired pleasant eyes

   humph funny business that
all trains hey oh all right all
right reckon they know what but
all the same- he tore off the top
sheet and limped to the door

  pusher  stood on the passing track
breathing deeply and evenly as if gath-
ering strength for the stiff climb up gla-
zier hill behind the thirty-seven loads
of extra  that waited on the main
line ahead just beyond the switch a
stalwart black-capped figure torch in
hand overalled and jacketed in grease-
smeared faded blue was leisurely oiling
round now stooping a little to peer back
of the big drive-wheels now reaching
over with long-spouted oil-can to satisfy
some thirsty cup

  hi redding you belvedere you
come here and get your orders 

  the black-cap faced about and the
flaring torch showed clear eyes set in
clean-looking whites cheeks that even
in the yellow smoky light were pink as
a girls-what you could see of the
natural color-and strong white teeth in
an amiable grin at the operators pet clas-
sical allusion when speaking to this par-
ticular black-cap

  frank redding knew nothing of
apollo or hercules or mercury or
venus except perhaps as euphonistic
titles to sundry pullman sleepers that he
aspired to whip around curves behind
him

  i	f he had had even a faint knowledge

cant i see him blush and jump for his
cab and swear fluently from the safe re-
treat of his cushion where - the splutter-
ing hiss of dripping water-cocks and the
subdued roar of fire-box would drown
all answering retorts to the operator

  at the door he caught the little lame
man by the elbows carried him over to
the desk and plumped him gently down
into the rickety armchair

   you stop your belvy-dearing me or
ill tell your wife youre thinking of some
other girl

  it was an old threat that always
brought a chuckle from farquehar-a
chuckle a trifle puzzling to the young
engineer indicative somehow of amuse-
ment at his expense

   gimme that order he bent down
close to the dingy station-lamp in a
moment he had straightened up and
looked quickly at the operator  sam
hill why this says-say you sure
you got this right

   sure thing a w o kd my re-
peat

  redding studied the sheet a full min-
ute longer

   humph were the moguls to-
night i suppose if the old man himself
was out in a special wed be over him
too-what 

  an impatient screech from far up the
track made him thrust the order into an
inside pocket

   well see you later friend jo-
siahs saying  what the deuce  

  he ran out to his engine and swung
up the steps a clang or two of the bell
a quick snort of the whistle a few soft
expulsions of the exhaust vnd 
moved slowly up the siding out across
the switch and coupled neatly onto the
rear end of extra 

  one hour later redding whistled
 good-by he and his fireman
watched the cabdose fade out of the
headlights ken and the green eyes of
the rear lanterns grow smaller and nearer
together and suddenly blot out alto-
gether as the train swept around a curve

  redding pulled back the reverse but
before opening the throttle once more
referred to the thin waxy sheet of the
train-order

   cant make anything else out of it
can von carl he handed it over
he launched himself
frantically out
toward the
white line
of sand

he omitted

to the fireman at the same time gently
pulling at the throttle as the steam
dropped hissing into the cylinders and
the drivers grumbled into sullen clank-
ing motion the fireman shook his head

the  extra	

 night wind whistled shrilly through the
 cab whipping the bell-cord viciously
 against the roof and swaying the bell it-
 self till it protested plaintively the head-
 light case sharply outlined against the fan

and passed the paper back

 nope were the folks to-
night

   all right here goes

-	he glanced out along the
track slipping sluggishly un-
der them through the thick
yellow light from the rear of
the tender braced himself
comfortably against the win-
dow jatnb and with right hand on
air - brake lever opened the throttle
wider for the slight incline to the top
of glazier hill the engine lurched to
the crest then with steam shut off
started on the five-mile coast downward

  the hand of the indicator jerked
steadily to thirty-five forty forty-five
fifty sixty seventy and stayed there the

of light beyond described unsteady arcs
as the tender swung this way or that
while at every lurch the iron apron be-
tween tender and engine scraped and
rasped and clattered truculently

  the telegraph-poles to the right of the
track grimly cross-armed far ahead
against the star-shot velvet of the prairie
sky lengthened swiftly to the dim outer


the railroad mans magazine

edge of the light-shaft hurtled gigantic
through it were swallowed voraciously
by the hungry night

  ragged splotches of mesqpit left un-
scarred by fire-guards beyond the right
of way lumbered gloomily past while

with such gusto and self-evidence as to
whom he wished they were that he
climbed again onto his seat smiling and
took a fresh chew of tobacco

a fourth mile whipped past blurredly
blotchily streakily and over sixty feet

his outstretched hand could not touch the rail

now and then still farther out a tufted
yucca cleanly silhouetted from the sum-
mit of some gentle rise paced slowly to
the rear

  a mile was gone two miles a
third through huelgers cut a swirl
of fine gravel stormed the cab  look
what you done  yelled carl ducking
his head

  redding roared spitting vigorously
  forgot  then he grinned and with
his free hand put thumb to nose and wig-
gled his fingers amiably at his fireman

	wouldnt that gravel you 

  the latter got off his seat spat on his
hands and made certain according-to-
code motions as tu what he wanted to
do to somebodys head happening to
glance at the steam-gage he grabbed the
chain and jerked open the furnace-door
shooting in a couple of shovelfuls of coal

of low trestle they roared splittingly into
the fifth now the damp wind slapped
their faces somewhere ahead was the
canadian river redding pressed over
ever so little the brass lever under his
right hand straightway a high thin
wail cut into the harsher sound chaos
and the cab felt a slight tremor

  he pressed farther the wail rose to
a scream the tremor to a shudder the
driver brake-shoes clamped closer and the
big wheels fretted hot struggled impo-
tently to shake off that relentless embrace
back dropped the hand of the indicator
sixty fifty forty thirty and at the
bridge fifteen

  the headlight speared a stretch of
black sluggish water sullenly menacing
where it had cut deep into the bank at
the farther end of the bridge just where
the track elbowed in a sharp curve
  redding looked back as the engine
took this curve he spat contemplative-
ly  the treacherous son-of-a-gun  
for half a mile beyond the bridge the
track was on a flat level then it took
a slight dip and swerved around the
council-a group of ragged rocks quaint-
ly up-tossed to form a circle of squatting
figures from there on the rise in the
land unevenly sand-duned and hillocked
was such as to coriceal for a full mile
the bed of the railroad

  half-way to the dip the fireman sud-
denly jerked himself upright and stared
wildly out into the night-not down the
track but across the space bound by
the coming curve his face whitened
under the coal-dust and grease ha
rubbed his eyes - then swung off his
cushion with a shrill yell

   theres s light for heavens
sake jump frank

  the last word was hardly past his lips
before he was out on the cab-step he
hung a fraction of a second by the hand-
rail and then launched himself fran-
tically out toward the white line of sand
ten feet from the track

  redding had dropped to his feet he
peered out from beyond the faint out-
line of a rounded hummock a long thin
shaft of mellow light pierced the nights
blackness

   hes right its   

  snap the lever shot to the emerg-
ency notch but the grinding furious up-
heaval for which he braced himself taut-
ly did not occur

  for the first time in her life s
air would not work

  only one thing to do he slammed
forward the reverse lever and as a
shower of slivered sparks shot from
underthe wrenched drivers opened the
throttle to its widest

  then he ripped the mild summer night
back and across and up and down with
a misery of sound from the raucous
throat of the whistle

  straightway it was answered and red-
ding knew what could be done was be-
ing done by  his own engine was
all atremble with the battle of the driv-
ers to grip the rails and the thunder of
the unshackled steam

  the gage showed eight miles an hour
as  skidded down the dip at the

    	r r

council and rounding the curve shivered
into the full glare of the east-botmd pas-
sengers headlight

   redding saw they must come together
but felt that no serious damage would
be done he hung on to the cab hand-
rail till but a score of feet away then
dropped he stumbled rolled off into
the ditch and sat up just as  bumped
into the other engine

   there was a splintering of wood from
a shattered pilot a clang of both bells a
tinkle of smashed headlight glass no
 shoved the pusher forward a few
feet and came to a standstill not so


  redding rubbed his eyes then he
remembered and leaped to his feet he
had thrown over the reverse-lever and
full steam was on

   the exultant wheels with the help of
 had at last come into their own
still slipping at times in a blur of spokes
they clung enough to the rails to send
the engine forward faster with every
stormy sputtering breath from the cylin-
ders

   redding raced silently at the side of
the cab-step but strain as he might his
outstretched hand could not toucli the
rail that would offer him grip more
frequently the huge drivers bit sure and
the rocking engine gathered speed

   the panting young engineer saw pic-
tures he saw the half-mile stretch of
straight smooth track ahead no
 would end it at seventy-five miles
an hour he saw the sharp swing to
the track as it met the bridge when
his engine struck this-heaven what
a thing to see a black raging thing
of the night in a flying leap-up out
down down into that bottomless hole
into arms patient a hundred years for
this he saw himself his hopes-her

   a thick dry sob wrung from his lips
then his toe struck a tie and he was
hurled sprawling-to reach at length the
hand-rail his fingers snapped tight
his legs were whipped across the rough
ties for a few yards then he drew him-
self up into the cab

   with steam shut off and new-gained
freedom lost the engine slowed sullenly
to a clanking grumbling curse-the-luck
stop a scared voice spoke from out the
darkness


the railroad mans magazine

  frank you there whats hap-
pened  

  a white scratched face peered up into
the cab bits of cinder and sand clung
to the yellow foretop

  the engineer looked down he sol-
emnly put thumb to nose and wig-
gled his fingers  wouldnt that gravel

  the timekeeper was playing his usual
afternoon game of solitaire sorting time-
slips the door opened and a big-
shouldered spruce figure entered

  the pink cheeks grew somewhat pink-

wide attractive grin

  shucks naw cant a fellow

while he laid a cigar on the desk

  the engineer again protested  honest
just want to take a lay-off since night

    he spread out his own particular

lovett-harrimans successor

by arno dosch

o

who will succeed harriman who will lake up the great work he left
undone who can do it these were the questions heard on every
side when the master-builder of the american railroad world passed
away last september

    the mantle lias fallen on the shoulders of robert s lovett a texas
lawyer born in  backwoods village overcoming the most serious obstacles
that poverty can put in the way of a young mans success he paid dearly for
an education and worked up inch by inch the master of his own destiny

jay gould huntington and harriman in turn recognized the executive
genius of the man who will now be the guiding
hand of properties worth 

 -v

austere texas father a
generation ago looked up
across the old - fashioned
fv sitting-room table and
said to his tall beardless
son

   robert i have decided to make a doc-
tor of you you may prepare to go to
tulare university in new orleans and

i	will pay your expenses

  that was all that was necessary so far
as the father was concerned he had
made up his mind about the matter and
it was as good as settled he was used
to having his way in all things and
his son had always obeyed without ques-
tion

   but i dont want to be a doctor fa-
ther i am going to be a lawyer

  at this unexpected revolt the fathers
cold gray eves settled  the determined
face of his son

   but i said you were going to be a
doctor i dont like lawyers

   im sorry for that father replied
the boy  but i have decided to be a law-
yer 

  he had unconsciously accented the last
 i and it gave him an uncomfortable
feeling of embarrassment to have so open-

ly thrown down the gage to his father
but his gray eyes never flinched as he re-
garded his stern parent

 have decided to be a lawyer


the railroad mans magazine

  there was a marked resemblance be-
tween the two they were southerners
of the masterful kind the civil war
had not broken the spirit of the father-
and he had handed on his courage to his
son neither knew what it was to give
in

  the father broke the silence

   then you can educate yourself his
thin lips articulated slowly

knew his mind early

  but being a fond father who had
raised two sons and two daughters after
his wifes early death he stood in the
place of both parents and so far as it
was in him to unbend he talked the mat-
ter over but the boy did not waver he
had reached the age of fifteen and there
had never been a time since he could first
remember when he did not feel capable
of taking care of himself in every way

  so one night be packed his clothes
and in the morning kissed his sisters good-
by the father smiled behind narrowed
lids as he saw his son stride away into
the world-his back straight and his legs
falling into a long easy stride for a ten-
mile walk he had  fear for the boys
future

  neither had the boy in a few hours
he reached the camp of a gang of swamp-
ers who were grubbing stumps ahead of
the grading-crew making track for the
houston east and west texas then
building along the eastern border of the
state

  he was put to work immediately and
earned a mans pay later he learned
that tie-splitting paid better so he
changed to that occupation and in a
few months he had risen to the dignity
of driving a team attached to a scraper
he worked there some months and re-
ceived three hundred dollars of this
glorious sum be spent during the time
just nine dollars and seventy-five cents
saving the rest for a years schooling in
houston

   this was the beginning of the career of
robert scott lovett chairman of the ex-
ecutive committees of the union pacific
and southern pacific railways he is
now forty-nine years old he sits in the
equitable life building  broadway
new york and directly controls the des-

tiny of twenty-five thousand miles of the
most carefully systematized railroads in
the world indirectly he has a voice in
the management of fifty-two thousand
more

   as the successor of the late e h har-
riman he has in his hands the fate of
properties valued at five billion two hun-

	red million dollars	

  when mr lovett was announced-as
harrimans successor a thousand ques-
tions immediately arose who was judge
lovett  whence came he  why had
we not heard of him before how could
a man rise so unobtrusively to such emi-
nence 

  his life-story is like a great drama
it deals with such usual aspirations and
such common situations that the force
of it seems likely to be lost until as it
unfolds it develops a great human strug-
gle-that of a man who fought against
hard conditions to fulfil his destiny

the  silent texan

  the nation is only beginning to know
him although he has been a man of wide
influence for years to present him so
as to appeal succinctly to the popular
imagination he might be called the
 silent texan he has already earned
the title

  what his influence in the railroad
world will be it is impossible now to
conjecture it is expected that he will
carry out the policies of harriman
uniting the harriman lines in closer and
closer cooperation during the last year
of harrimans life he conducted almost
all the active work directing and har-
monizing with the plans of the two great
operating factors-j c stubbs director
of traffic  the money-maker and julius
kruttschnitt director of maintenance and
operation  the money-saver harri-
man always wise in his selection of men
had made of them a team which increases
efficiency and dividend

   judge lovetts first duty will be to pre-
vent the disintegration of the traffic sys-
tem as established and to widen oppor-
tunities toward even greater efficiency
the constructive side to harrimans oper-
ations in the stocks of railroads lay in
the cooperative possibilities of the lines
controlled to hold together the great
lovett-harrimans successor

system he finally established requires a
strong man

  the man who is now in that position
in personality and experience seems to be
thoroughly fitted for the undertaking
he has had a training as a railroad man
which few have enjoyed he not only
gathered in a great deal of information

on his own account but he absorbed the
knowledge possessed by jay gould col-
lis p huntington and e h harriman

  no one could wish to learn from more
able masters

  let it be remembered by every young
man struggling along in the railroad serv-
ice doing tasks that appear to him to be


the railroad mans magazine

lacking in opportu-
nity judge lovett
w oul d not be
where he is to-day 
if it were not for
the fact that he
served a rail road
in the humblest and
most monotonous
capacity

  added to his ex-
perience in con-
struction he passed
a year at the thank-
less task of a coun-
try station - agent
and worked six
years as a night
bill-clerk no more
severe appren-
ticeship could be
asked

  he realizes the
value of his train-
ing now it did not
mean much to him
then he regarded
the work as a neces-
sary evil to keep life in his body while he
studied law

  but the fierce contact with the earth
the ready capability of bridge-builder
and engineer and the shrewd practicality
of a trainman gave him an under-
standing of what can be done with
a railroad which helped him at every
important step in the steady climb up-
ward until he stood beside the wizard
of railroading and told him where he
was right and where he was wrong

  it is a well-known fact among judge
lovetts associates that he has no per-
sonal ambition he does not care for
power he realized his ambition in life
when he became a thorough lawyer

  his ambition in that direction knows
no limits but to pile up millions upon
millions has no lure for him

harriman knew

  when harriman in  brought
judge lovett from texas to be his chief
counsel wall street did not realize
this new and powerful influence that was
being introduced it is doubtful whether
harriman realized himself it is rather

difficult in fact
considering the
standards of to-
day to appreciate
j udge lovetts at-
titude

  he would have
been better under-
stood sixty or sev-
enty years ago
when the point of
view of men was
different to him
life carries its du-
ties chief of which
is that a man must
fulfil his destiny
he has work to do
in the world and
he must do that to
the best of his
abilities

  if j udge lov-
etts fortunes had
confined his life to
the backwoods of
texas he would
have prepared his
small cases with the same painstaking
care with which he lined up the defense
for the harriman merger in the suit for
its dissolution brought by the interstate
commerce commission

  pure grit has brought him to the top
of the ladder life has always been to
him a serious matter and he has not
trifled with it his presence is dignified
and must always have been so there
have never been many people who called
him  bob  lovett

  he has a natural courtesy easy man-
ners and consideration for others and
to the men who work with him he is
friendly and sympathetic but he could
never have been a  good fellow it
is not in his make-up

  all these things are plainly written
on his face it is easy to believe that
lie has never sowed his wild oats he
feels himself superior to dishonorable
action

  the chin is alwsolutely determined
but not hard the severe mouth is
drawn into a straight line with thin lips
that might denote cruelty if the eyes did
not show kindness the nose is purely
racial in its characteristics indicating the

he had no fear for the boys future
lovett-harrimans successor



strength that was born in him but the
power of mouth and chin and nose all
feel the tempering of his eyes which
appeal perhaps beyond the point of
sound judgment no one could look
into his eyes and think evil of him they
show that high order of intelligence in
which is neither trickery or self-seeking

what his face tells

  his countenance might have come out
of an old portrait at first glance he
is rather remindful of the old - time
yankees mftn of his type are not de-
veloped in cities when you learn that
his father was a georgian who pio-
neered into texas long before the war
much is explained

  physically he is erect and strong
the fact that he has not since his youth
turned his hand to physical exercise
even in sport has not told on his
athletic build years of wearing night-
work have not broken his health even
the rush of wall street could not
quicken his firm tread

  when he first went to work on the
railroad he was already hardened to
labor since the day that his father re-
turned from the civil war and an-
nounced that they would all have to
work as they could no longer pay the
negroes to work for them there had
never been a let-up

  besides the plantation in san jacinto
county where they lived the father
william l lovett started a country
store and public cotton-gin between
the three at all of which the children
worked they found their days and eve-
nings well taken up during the winter
they squeezed in three or four months
schooling

his fathers misfortune

  as they grey older they worked
harder they became prosperous and
their family was regarded as well-to-do
the father maintained his importance in
a growing community and was able to
go on the bond of a fellow citizen who
was elected tax-collector

  for this friendly act he received no
compensation the tax-collector ab-
sconded and william i lovett had to

make good the peculations this re-
duced the family to the point where it
had been at the close of the civil war
with the added advantage that the chil-
dren were older and better able to help
without a whimper they turned their
hands to work again and forgot the loss

  the texas which judge lovett knew
as a boy is not the texas of open ranges
and cowboys the settlement of which
his family formed a part was in a re-
mote valley surrounded by timbered
hills with the years the father lost
something of the southerner and be-
came more of the westerner the sons
grew up typical texans

   it was the day of the six-shooter and
the bowie knife which men found use-
ful not only against one another but
as a protection from wild animals the

lovetts lived ten miles from cold
springs the county-seat and the inter-
vening distance was without a house
it lay through a rough country full of
deer and bear which robert lovett
hunted from the time he was big enough
to point a rifle


the railroad mans magazine

  these woods also contained such dan-
gerous animals as mountain-lions and
timber - wolves returning from cold
springs after nightfall which frequent-
ly happened young robert often heard
the deceptive wail of the panther and
the chorus of its fellows from every
peak as this died away there rose the
howls of the wolves hunting in packs

he directly controls the destiny of
twenty-five thousand miles of the
most carefully systematized
railroads in the world

  they sent a chill to his bones-but
the next time there was occasion to re-
turn from cold springs at night he rode
back alone as usual

  at one point on this long lonely jour-
ney was a spot locally known as sol-
diers camp during the war a regi-
ment had been raised in the valley for
the confederate army and this had been
their mustering place before they
marched away a quarrel between two of
them arose one night and one killed the
other

he feared a ghost

  the negroes immediately became su-
perstitious of the spot and they instilled
their fears in the young boys of the
neighborhood robert lovett at the
age of ten had absorbed all these su-

perstitions and had a thorough belief in
ghosts of this large family the most
prominent local member was the ghost
of the dead soldier and his activities
were vouched for by any number of
negroes who had seen him his pur-
pose in walking the negroes soon de-
cided was to take vengeance on any
member of the human family who
crossed his path

  when the boy returning home from
the market-place in the dark approached
the spot he became uncomfortable about
it long before he was within striking
distance as it became imminent the
hair prickled under his hat and six-
shooter in hand he rode down upon it
determined to meet what death was pre-
pared for him

  each time as the awful spot was
passed he drew his breath and scam-
pered home on his pony safe for the
night but on the next occasion the
terror was unabated

  he was convinced that sooner or
later the ghost would get him the
chances were too strong against him

face to face

  one night he rode home under a moon-
less sky the stars so thickly clustered
that their pale light spread thinly along
the uncertain road lighting the darkness
so that trees and banks he was long fa-
miliar with took on strange shapes

  the forest was silent but stirred as if
the earth were about to wake and scream
with a nightmare he seemed to be get-
ting nowhere the journey was intol-
erably long

  the distracting light even deceived
him as to how far he had progressed
until he suddenly rounded a curve near
the fateful spot it took him a second
to realize it but a form - white and
ghostlike-fluttered over the road

  the jony started and quivered and
the world stood still all the terrors of
the eight miles that lay behind heaped
up at his back it was not in him to
turn but he hardly dared go forward
tn his excitement he spurred the pony
and found himself racing at the awesome
vision

  the-ponys hoofs pounded the hard
road waking the birds in the near-by
lovett-harrimans successor



ifbi if

trees but worrying not the ghost in the
highway

  he was in for it and held the six-
shooter cocked for whatever use it might
be to him he fancied the ghost moved
and with a fresh spurring he rushed on
the catastrophe

   quack quack quack  went the
ghost and fluttered into the forest

  he passed the same spot when he
went away to work on the railroad but
by this time the world-natural or su-
pernatural-no longer held any terrors
for him he was a full-grown man with
a purpose and a determination to carry
it out he scorned the usual weak-
nesses of youth grading-camps are not
usually the best place for country boys
of fifteen but so far as robert lovett
was concerned there were no tempta-
tions

  the railroad through which he found
a way out into the world was only 
miles long when completed it extend-
ed from houston across the line into
louisiana ending at the quiet river town
of shreveport

  it was built by paul bremond a rich
houston citizen in the time of individ-
ual financing he used his own money
on the enterprise work was begun on
it in  but it was not until  that
the grading - crews reached san jacinto
county it was then that robert lovett

did the first piece of work outside his
own home the road has long since be-
come part of the southern pacific system
and it is now one of the least of the
holdings over which judge lovett has
control through it he rose to fame
and fortune and now in turn its fame
is derived from him

  he did nothing but manual labor dur-
ing the first year when he returned
from his years schooling in houston
driven back by the lackof money he
went to work as a clerk in the store of
e p smith at shepard on the line of
the railroad after he had been there
a short time his proclivities toward the
railroad business secured for him the
position of station-master-

  there he learned another important
side of the business which many men
high in the railroad world have found
valuable he gave up the clerkship
but continued in smiths employ as book-
keeper doing the work at night his
day was from seven in the morning until



hunted from the time he was big enough
to point a rifle




the railroad mans magazine

the ghost was vouched for by the negroes

midnight at this he continued a year
and saved several hundred dollars

  this was enough to give him further
opportunity to acquire an education
but by this time being seventeen years
old he considered himself capable of
deciding on his own curriculum that
provided by the high school in houston
had in it much that he could see no use
for so he did not return but hired a
tutor who taught him just the tilings he
wanted to know latin in particular
seemed to him a necessity for a lawyer
so he mastered that language

  he did not wish to be again interrupt-
ed in his studies for lack of money so
he secured the position of night bill-
clerk in the houston office of the hous-
ton east and west texas this paid
him forty dollars a month and after his
savings gave out he lived on that in-
come and paid for a tutor

  men who have to work so hard for
an education fully appreciate it at
night the work usually lasted until
eleven or twelve oclock but when there
was a rush of business he had not always
finished the way-bills when the new day
broke many a morning he sat down to
his serious purpose of study gaunt with
lack of sleep

  at the age of twenty-two or after
five years of this trying life he was ad-
mitted to the bar but even then he did

not feel thoroughly fitted for his life-
work and continued his studies another
year before attempting to practise his
profession

  his career did not go unnoticed the
other men in the office and those of the
rank above knew of him when he an-
nounced that he intended going back to
cold springs to practise law the rail-
road officials offered him the local attor-
neyship they knew the caliber of the
man

  moreover they did not forget him
the cases he had to argue at first were
chiefly matters pertaining to the cow-
catching tendency of trains but he gave 
these his serious attention his reward
came in less than a year when he was
removed to nacogdoches where he car-
ried on the railroads business over a
much larger territory

  this took all his time and he soon
became known for the number of cases
he won at the end of the second year
he was sent to houston and made the
general attorney for the road when it
went into the hands of a receiver a little
later he was already known as one of
the best railroad lawyers in the state

he held the six-shooter cocked
lovett-harrimans successor



and the texas and pacific at that time
the most important road in the south-
west made him an offer he went to
dallas as assistant general attorney and
when he was twenty-nine he was made
general attorney

  jay gould owned the line and was
in the habit at that time of his life of
going down to texas in january and re-
maining until april he spent most of
the intervening months in dallas where
he found the company of the young law-
yer agreeable unconsciously during
many meetings he imparted to lovetts
all - grasping mind much that he knew
about railroads

  he had a good position one with
which most men would be content but
he aspired to a more general practise
he had in fact absorbed all that there
was to be learned where he was and was
anxious for a wider field of activity

  after he had been four years with the
texas and pacific an offer was made to
him to become a partner in the firm of
baker botts  baker then an important
law firm the two older members re-
tired with his entrance leaving all the
work of a large clientele on the shoul-
ders of captain baker and the new
partner

  among other clients were the mis-
souri kansas and texas and the south-
ern pacific railroads the railroad end
of the business naturally fell to lovett
he could not escape it if he had desired
here another big railroad man col  is
p huntington sought his advice

  texas was beginning to legislate se-
verely against the railroads and lovetts
work for huntington was important
he won many legal battles and in the
conferences with huntington absorbed
another great mass of railroad knowl-
edge the two men were early on a
basis of friendship which continued until
huntingtons death

  when harriman appeared as control-
ling genius of the southern pacific he
looked over the system and learned it
completely he sought information
everywhere available

  he also knew much about railroads
and could tell whether he was being-ac-
curately informed in texas he found
that the most reliable information he re-
ceived was from judge lovett as a

consequence when the system was reor-
ganized- he retained j udge lovett as the
legal representative in texas

  during the next three years the rail-

his day was from seven in the morning
until midnight

roads business occasionally demanded
judge lovetts presence in new york
and once in a while harriman went to
texas harrimans respect for judge
lovetts opinion grew with each meeting

  meanwhile harriman was perfecting
his system he created the administra-
tive -positions occupied by kruttschnitt
and stubbs and he needed a third man-
the best legal adviser he could find
looking over the field he decided on
judge lovett and sent for him to come
to new york the two men worked
admirably together and gradually har-
riman shifted more and more of the de-
tails upon the shoulders of his able col-
league during the last year almost all
the work fell to judge lovett

   in fairness to father and son it should
not be forgotten that they made up their
quarrel years ago  and the father once
recognizing that his son was right let
him go his own gait

chapter v
a villain turns pirate

a moment we stood
thus no one speaking my
uncle and frederic welch
breathing hard i expect-
jl ed to see miss holland
in tears but i was much
surprised her face was white and her
lips were trembling yet there was some-
thing in the look she gave uncle dick
that made me glad i had betrayed my-
self to help her

   leave the cabin  uncle dick com-
manded welch

  welch sneered straightened his collar
and started to walk across the room
uncle dick remained standing beside
the door watching every movement

  his manner told me that he suspected
treachery but welch made no attempt
at violence he slipped into the passage
and went into one of the cabins uncle
dick slammed the door shut

   something must be done at once
miss holland cried  hell tell them
that the boy is here

   roland must leave this cabin uncle
dick said

becan in the november railroad ma



  where are you going to take him
they will search your cabin too

    my cabin will not be safe

   then-

    we must find a hiding-place

  uncle dick went out and presently
returned and beckoned me to follow

    be careful miss holland warned
we went outside and started to go on
deck half-way up we heard some one
approaching we ran down quickly and
went into uncle dicks cabin  and when
the sailor had visited captain hawsons
cabin and had gone back to the deck
we slipped out and made the deck in
safety	

   i crawled beneath a lot of sail-cloth
and rope and uncle dick went forward
the sea was not so calm and the ship was
tossing like a cork  the water i heard
several men go below and come up again
but could not see who they were finally
i heard welchs voice he was talking
to another man within a few feet of my
hiding-place

   i tell you the boy is aboard i
heard him say  they have hidden him
somewhere but it ought to be an easy
matter to find him when you do-

    it will be an easy matter to cut his
throat the other man answered

s magazine single copies  cents

 
the daughter

   i do not want his throat cut welch
replied  i want him to live there
are worse deaths than that which comes
by cutting the throat

   ah you want him to die with the
others 

   exactly welch replied  if the
crew finds him here hell be thrown
overboard in an instant he must live
to reach the island i have certain plans
which must be carried out

   what do you want me to do then 

  if you find the boy pretend to be
his friend get into his confidence make
him believe you are hiding him to save
him and so keep him out of sight of the
rest of the crew when we get to the
island ill play my hand

  very good the man replied and
then they went forward

  for the hundredth time i caught my-
self wondering what it all meant i
was glad that i had overheard for now
i could be on my guard the man
would be serving a double purpose-
my uncles as well as welchs-by se-
creting me from the crew perhaps in
the end he would serve my uncles pur-
pose best

  welch had said he wanted me to die
with the others who were the others
my uncle was one of them i supposed
but was miss holland the other

  why had those men acted so pecu-
liarly in her cabin what was it she
refused to do at their bidding what
part was welch playing in this game of
which i knew nothing

  it was suffocating beneath the pile of
sail-cloth and i determined to leave-the
place and find another it was an easy
matter to slip away in the darkness and
make my way forward toward the fore-
castle there were all manners of
hiding-places there that would serve un-
til daylight

  far up near the bowsprit i crawled
behind a mass of rope from my posi-
tion  could look over all the deck 
could even see the man at the wheel
captain hawson was pacing back an i
forth near the rail with his hands be-
hind his back three or four members
of the crew were going about their work

  after a time i saw uncle dick come
forward and speak to captain hawson
at first  could not hear what they said

of the idol	

because of the rushing wind but pres-
ently they walked toward me and came
to a stop directly beneath sheltered from
the wind and spray

   i suppose money would not do it
i heard my uncle say

   it will not captain hawson re-
plied

    i thought youd do anything for
money  

   most things the captain admitted
 but this is different i made an agree-
ment with them to capture you and take
you over if i had failed to capture you
it would have made  difference but
since you have been captured since the
crew knows you are here things are
changed

  -	 it would be as much as my life is
worth to let you go now they would
hunt me like a dog from one end of the
earth to the other as they have hunted
you i would be safe nowhere id die
some day-as you are going to die

   then there is another thing i
couldnt do it if i wanted to the crew
is watching me you forget they belong
to the island the moment i started to
turn back theyd seize the ship throw
me overboard and run the chances
then there is  hope my uncle
said

   ive heard a great deal of you the
captain answered  and  always under-
stood you were a brave man i suppose
it is different now that you are staring
death in the face

    i have stared death in the face manv
times without flinching uncle dick re-
plied  there is perhaps another rea-
son why i wish to escape

  a woman questioned the captain
   no-a bov

   your son 

   my sisters son do not ask how
this affects him but it does

   you speak as if lie were with you
doomed to a death like the one that is
to be yours

   you do not understand my uncle
said then nothing can be done

   nothing

   have you no heart that you capture
people and deliver them up to execu-
tioners  

  captain hawsons voice changed  per-
haps in this case i think you merit
the railroad mans magazine

the execution he said  i have been a
tough customer in my time but have
little respect for a man who would de-
spoil-

  stop uncle dick cried you
have gone far enough-that lie lias trav-
eled far enough  i was not the despoiler
ill go to my death swearing it

   youll never convince me of that
said captain hawson  i say it was
you who despoiled-

  my uncle was at his throat before he
could finish the sentence captain haw-
son screamed as they clinched  then they
fought back and forth across the deck
like mad beasts

  members of the crew ran toward them
fell upon them tore them apart angry
though he was the breath half choked
out of him captain hawsons first words
were to the men who held my uncle
prisoner telling them to set him free

    stay by me when mr engle is near
the captain instructed one of the crew
 he presumes upon the knowledge that
no harm must befall him to use vio-
lence

   i fight no man who cannot fight
back uncle dick retorted yet there
are some insinuations that cannot go
unpunished

  captain hawson made no reply he
remained standing near the rail waiting
to see what uncle dick was going to
do i saw welch come forward then
and look upon the scene

   having a little trouble with the
chivalrous despoiler captain hawson
he sneered

  the captain whirled upon him  mr
welch he said  only a coward insults
a man who is down there are reasons
why there can be no violence between
mr engle and myself but i know of
no reason why there should be no vio-
lence between mr engle and you

  if you insult him again i trust he
will give you the thrashing you deserve
if he does not ill have you in irons
no man shall insult a passenger i have
instructions to treat with every courtesy
 do you know to whom you are
speaking welch cried

    most certainly

 if you know what is good for you
youll keep a civil tongue in your head
if you know what is good for you

the captain replied  youll go below
immediately

    youll regret your words sir
welch thundered

    will you go below or shall i send
you 

  neither welch screamed you
have forgotten yourself it seems you
shall know who is master here you are
but a puppet hired for certain work i
am the one who rules

   captain hawson stepped toward him
threateningly

    go below instantly  he cried
 welch laughed  send me  he said
  ill take you the captain answered
 and sprang upon him

   welch dodged to one side and called
something in that foreign tongue to
those of the crew who were standing
near they rushed in immediately and
grasped their captain

   captain hawson welch said
 things have arrived at the stage where
i find it necessary to take things into my
own hands

    this is mutiny-piracy  the cap-
tain cried

    under ordinary circumstances it
would be welch replied  but these
are not ordinary circumstances first of
all things is to carry out the commands
of one who shall be unnamed here if
mutiny is necessary to do this-

    seize him  put him in irons  cap-
 tain hawson cried

   none of the crew moved to obey

    you see   welch said  they know
 whom to obey

   you are taking command of this
ship the captain demanded

   i am	n

   and what will you say when our
destination is reached

    ill say that you bargained with
engle to turn back as i just heard you
doing

    you lie 

    i heard you-no one else ill say
it was necessary to take command of this
ship to execute our enterprise success-
fully ill mention that such an act is
mutiny and will cause certain people
trouble if the knowledge gets out and
then perhaps the knowledge will never
sret out for a dead man tells no tales
tte spoke roldly and cruelly
the daughter of the idol



   that is what conies of treating
frederic welch without courtesy he
ended

  you cur captain hawson cried

   take him below and put him in
irons welch commanded the men

  captain hawson tore himself loose
and was at welchs throat in the twink-
ling of an eye they went down to-
gether on the deck i saw uncle dick
rush toward them but he was too late
for the members of the crew uttering
cries in their peculiar tongue tore the
belligerents apart lifted welch from the
deck and made hawson prisoner again

 take him below put him in
irons  welch commanded again

   youll do nothing of the sort said
a voice behind them

  all turned to look ruth holland
had stepped from behind the mast into
the circle cast by the smoking lamp she
held her revolver in her hand and it
covered frederic welch

chapter vi

i touch the aitu

crederic welch she com-
manded  have captain hawson
released this minute and allow him to
take command of his ship

   i issue orders here said welch
boldly

   we will leave it to the men she
said

  one of them the one who had been
spokesman in her cabin during their
midnight call stepped forward between
the girl and welch

   we do not understand this he said
 why should the master and the most
exalted one differ

   will you obey me instantly  welch
screamed  do you want me to report
upon our arrival that you raised your
hand against me

  theman made a gesture of despair

   we are to carry out the proper com-
mands he said  if the master wishes
it this man shall go below in irons

  welch smiled at miss holland but
was not outdone she walked quickly
toward them across the sloping deck

   you are supposed to honor me are
you not she asked

   we honor you deeply most exalted
one the man replied

   do you honor me by refusing to
obey the first wish i have ever expressed
to you this man you call master is
doing a wrong captain hawson should
command the ship release him in-
stantly  

  the man looked from her to welch
uncertain what to do

   enough of this  welch cried
 do as i command i am your master
is it not so you were told to obey me
in all things pertaining to your land
above all else we wer to secure pos-
session of this man engle and return
him alive and well to the island is
not that so

   now i learn that captain hawson
is not to be trusted that to trust him is
to run the risk of never getting this man
to the island you know what failure
means

   this woman who faces you has a
womans heart and does not like violence
she pleads for the captain because she
thinks he isbeing wronged she does
not understand as i do

   carry out my  commands without
further delay and i will assume all the
risk and responsibility when the island
is reached refuse to carry them out
and ill report you for a lo of unbeliev-
ing dogs to the one you most fear 

  the man hesitated a moment then
turned toward captain hawson

   he goes below-in irons the man
said

  stop ruth holland commanded
again

  the man stepped before her  we
must obey the commands of the man we
are told to call master he said  the
most exalted one will not attempt to
hinder us 

  miss holland stepped before welch

   what is it you intend to do   she
asked

   command this ship until the voyage
is over

  and after that-

  it is none of your business

  you know what i mean what will
you say when you sail into the harbor
with captain hawson a prisoner

   dont let that annoy you i shall
have some fitting story believe me


the railroad mans magazine

   a story that will cost the captain
his life

  perhaps he insulted me a short
time since

   you cur 

   beware some curs bite  welch
exclaimed

  ruth stepped back toward the light
again

   when you start to take captain
hawson below i begin firing she said

   at the poor men who are carrying
out orders i presume

   no she said  at you  

   do you dare oppose me in this i
have greater power here than you have 
he motioned for the men to take the
captain below from my place up near
the bowsprit i watched carcfully won-
dering how this scene was to end ruth
holland raised the revolver and pointed
it at welch

   tell them to stop  she ordered
the men went on her finger pressed
the trigger

   stop   welch commanded

   have the captain released  she or-
dered

   no 

   have him released  

  there was no mistaking the meaning
in her voice welch motioned for the
men to release captain hawson

   are you satisfied now   he asked
  no you must go below

   very well 

  the alacrity with which he started to
comply should have warned her it did
warn uncle dick and the captain for
they cried out words of caution at the
same time but it was too late

  as he neared her welch turned upon
her suddenly and grasped her right arm
at the wrist one shot went wild the
next instant welch had her revolver in
his haids

  uncle dick and the captain sprang
forward but at welchs command the
crew fell upon them thrust uncle dick
back against the rail and made captain
hawson prisoner again

  take him away welch ordered
two of the men led the captain aft
the others remained

   miss plolland welch said  i find
it necessary to order you to remain in
your cabin for the present

  and if i refuse

   do not forget that i command this-

ship 

   and do not forget cried my uncle
springing toward them  that your act
in seizing this ship is piracy accord-
ing to the law any law-abiding man is
privileged to deal with a pirate in an at-
tempt to regain a ship for its com-
mander  

  welch laughed  you expect to make
the attempt he asked

   if i should the law is on my side
 the men aboard this ship recognize
another law of which i am the present
representative welch replied  if you
conduct yourself properly you shall
have every courtesy sir if youmake a
move to thwart me it may be otherwise
 you expect a man to stand by idly
and be carried to his death my ure
demanded

   leave the deck  said welch

  he motioned for two of the men

   conduct mr engle and miss hol-
land to their cabins he said

  my uncle started to walk aft ruth
holland stood still beneath the light
both of them seemed to realize that the
present was no time for violence they
would have to wait

  uncle dick stopped when he came up
with miss holland and motioned for
her to go first

   of our own differences we will not
speak at present he said  but allow
me to say that i respect all womankind
enough to guard even a woman who has
caused me untold harm

  what do you mean welch cried
 i mean it is not safe for a lady to
remain alone in the presence of a man
who insults women my uncle said

  miss holland bowed and walked ahead
of uncle dick welch did not reply
but the sneer was upon his lips as he
watched them disappear

  i wondered what would happen next
it would be daylight in another hour and
i would be discovered if i remained
where i was it was necessary to find
another hiding-place

  welch remained on deck several of
the men near him he issued orders
much the same as captain hawson had
done and it was evident that he knew
how to handle a ship
the daughter of the idol



    after a time he went aft toward the
 wheel i watched my chance and
 slipped down among the ropes and
 gained the deck keeping in the
 shadows i crept back past the men on
 deck behind the mast there i waited
 for several minutes crouching in the
 dark

   after a time welch went forward
 again then i made my way aft as
 swiftly as possible and reached my old
 hiding-place in the pile of sail-cloth it
 seemed that no one was below in the pas-
 sage i grew bolder after a time and
 started to descend

    before i could reach my uncles cabin
  i heard steps on deck there was a
  door at my right and no light came from
  beneath it i tried it it opened i
  stepped inside and closed the door again

   some one walked along the passage
 -and entered the next cabin i could not
 see in the cabin i had entered and was
 afraid to strike a match i remained
 standing near the door listening voices
 came to me from the next room

     ltnless they are made prisoners in
 their cabins they will recapture the ship
 welch was saying

     but it is forbidden to mistreat mr
  engle and no one dares lay hands upon
  the woman replied the voice of the
  man who had been spokesman for the
  crew

     it is necessary welch declared
  suppose the god says it should be
 done 

    what the aitu commands shall be
 executed was the reply

    shall we implore the aitu

    if you say so master

     at once then  

    there was no time in which to explore
  i slipped behind the draperies and
  found myself at the foot of a flight of
  steps i crept up as far as i could and
  my hands came in contact with some-
  thing of metal-something shaped pe-
  culiarly

    at the same instant i heard them open
  the door

     some one else must be present mas-
  ter  it is the law the man told welch

     call captain hawson mr engle
 and the woman welch replied

   the man went out i heard welch
 strike a match the draperies were so

     	r r

heavy that no light filtered through i
hoped that my place of concealment
would not be discovered there was a
babel of voices

   we are going to consult the aitu on a
matter of importance i heard welch
say  the law as you know says that
some one other than the two parties to
the controversy shall be present i have
asked you to be here

   if you are working on the belief of
these fanatics to further your own des-
picable ends- began uncle dick

   silence   welch commanded

  he spoke some words to the man in
that strange tongue and the others
voice was raised in a chant suddenly
i felt the draperies before me give way
with a jerk and the next instant was
almost blinded by the light

  i looked down at the group before
me a group of terror-stricken faces
quickly i looked about me at the
head of the flight of steps was a great
idol of metal an evil grinning face a
head surmounted by a crown of jewels
my arm had been restingupon its shoul-
der

  cries from those below made me turn
toward them- quickly the man who
had accompanied welch to the cabin
stood before me his hands shaking
uncle dicks face was white so was
miss hollands there was surprise in
captain iiawsons for he did not dream
that i was in existence or on his ship

   he is doomed whoever he is i
heard the captain say

  uncle dick was screaming something
at me miss holland had begun to
weep welch was cursing to himself
but above them all i heard the wail of
the man who posed as spokesman for the
crew a wail that cut into my heart and
filled me with dread

   he has touched the aitu he has
touched the aitu  he cried  he has
defiled the god and so he must die

chapter vii

uncle dick turns coward

tnstinct caused me to reach in my
pocket for the revolver that was
there i held it gripped in my hand
but did not remove it from the pocket


the railroad mans magazine

   who is this boy how did he come
aboard captain hawson demanded

   he is my nephew uncle dick said
 his presence aboard is an accident i
discovered him some hours ago and
have been trying to keep him hidden

   did any one else see him aboard and
fail to report the matter hawson de-
manded

   i knew he was here miss holland
said

   you know what i mean replied
captain hawson  i was not speaking
of you but of those who believe the
boy is an outsider he has no right on
this ship if any one saw him and
failed to report it-

   mr welch knew i was aboard
sir  i cried down to him

  it is a lie welch screamed
 had i known it i should have report-
ed it at once that the law might have
been upheld

   he found me in miss hollands
cabin i went on and afterward i
heard him talking with one of the men
telling him to make friends with me and
keep me hidden from the others

  is this true mr welch the cap-
tain demanded

  it is not true he replied and
by what right do you question me i
command the faraway at present sir
captain hawson cor fronted him his
eyes blazing  mr welch he said
-things i have heard and seen within
the past few hours have convinced me
that you are not a true believer but are
working upon superstition and fanaticism
to further certain ends of your own

   ill have nothing to do with the
rest of it i tell you now to your face
that i will regain possession of this ship
and put back to san francisco or go to
death attempting it

  welch turned upon him in a rage
crying orders in that foreign tongue
on the deck overhead was the patter of
bare feet and soon the doorway was
crowded with swarthy faces

   seize these people and make them
prisoners welch commanded

  captain hawson whirled around and
ran to the foot of the steps miss hol-
land crouched at one side of the cabin
holding her hands before her face

  it took but an instant for uncle dick

to hurl welch toone side and dash after
the captain and there at the foot of
the flight of steps which led to the idol
the captain and my uncle prepared for

defense

  they had no weapons and the others
had but could not use them it was
not a part of welchs scheme to have
my uncle murdered and though i be-
lieve he would have seen the captain
die without a bit of regret it would not
have been diplomatic at the time

   seize them put them in irons
they are trying treacheryj  he cried

  the men sprang forward to obey
and then the battle began back and
forth across the floor they fought every
one at a disadvantage in the small cabin
repeatedly uncle dick was made
prisoner and fought himself free and it
was the same with the captain

  finally hard pressed they mounted
the steps ore by one fighting the others
back at the door welch screamed for
his men to hurry with their work ruth
holland still stood against the wall but
her hands were no longer before her eyes
for she was watching the combat

   seize them all-the bov too 
welch screamed  he has touched the
aitu-he must die  

   stepped behind the idol and peered
around it one of the men had llncle
dick by the throat choking him into
submission without hesitation i raised
the revolver and fired the man gave
a scream toppled over backward and
crashed down the steps to the cabin floor

  the smoke from the revolver filled
the cabin all of the men were scream-
ing some of them trying to get out at
the door and welch was trying to pre-
vent it calling to them that they were
cowards

  they rushed the steps half a dozen
of them brushing uncle dick and the
captain aside i fired again and one
of them went down the others fell
back down the steps

  after him cowards welch was
screaming

  but they had no heart for such figlrt-
ing with terror in their hearts they
rushed to the door and fled through it into
the passage they were brave men
frenzied fighters but they could not face
a weapon with no chance to retaliate
the daughter of the idol



  uncle dick and the captain rushed
down the steps and fought with welch
and the one man who remained i fol-
lowed them wondering what the next
move would be

  it took less than a minute for them to
conquer welch and his man and then
the captain grasped me by the arm uncle
dick helped ruth holland and we ran
into the passage aud through it to the
end

  there the captain burst open a door
and we entered a tiny room crept through
another dark passage and finally reached
the deck forward

  the captain led us up near the bow-
sprit where i had been hiding earlier in
the night it was a natural barricade
and commanded the deck

   well fight it out here the captain
said

  day was breaking in the east and thus
we faced a new danger our discovery
was but a question of an hour or so
and indeed it was a matter of less time
than that for it was scarcely half an
hour befoje we were tracked to our hid-
ing-place and welch stood down on the
deck before us sneering

  shall i fire at him sir i asked
uncle dick

  no-no hawson cried shoot
him down and these fanatics will rush
into hades itself to capture us and torture
us to death do not waste cartridges-
wait 

  welch stood out where we could see
him plainly in the gathering day  will
you come down and surrender if i allow
you the freedom of the ship he asked

   no replied the captain promptly

   i am not speaking to you sir
welch said  i am speaking to mr
engle he is to be treated with every
courtesy so is the boy now that he is
doomed

   it goes without saying that miss
holland may be sure of every kind at-
tention will you come down mr en-
gle with miss holland and the boy and
take the freedom of the ship

  uncle dick turned to ruth holland
and questioned with his eyes what he
read there caused him to turn toward
welch quickly and reply

   well take our chances up here
sir he said

  welch called the men to him they
were armed with revolvers

   i am giving you a last chance he
said  will you come down and take
the freedom of the ship or shall i have
my men fire upon you

    youll scarcely do that i think my
 uncle said

   do not presume too much  welch
cried  there is less censure in taking
a dead man to the island than in allow-
ing a live one to escape for the last
time-will you come down

  my uncle hesitated then-

    yes  he said

  captain hawson uttered an oath my
surprise was so great that i could not
speak ruth hollands cheeks flamed
and she gave my uncle a look of scorn
such as i never saw before uncle dick
looked her bravely in the eyes

   you do not understand he said

  her cry must have been like a knife
in his heart

  you coward 

chapter viii

uncle dicks return

t tncle dick stood on his feet and
 looked back at her then he
stepped nearer to me

   you will remain here roland he
said

  then i understood and would have
spoken but he motioned for me to keep
silent he sprang forward and made
his way to the deck and walked up to
welch

   i am to have the freedom of the
ship remember he said  if i am to

die	my last days shall be comfortable
ones at any event

   i have nothing against you sir
welch replied  i have forgotten the
little trouble we had in miss hollands
cabin i am glad that you take matters
so sensibly

  fie turned toward us again  are
the rest of you going to avail yourselves
of my offer  he cried

   i for one am not  replied cap-
tain hawson

   will you come down miss hol-
land  

   id rather remain here and take my


the railroad mans magazine

chances with a brave man and a boy
she answered

  welch cursed and turned to his men
as though to give an order but uncle
dick stepped forward again

   do not get yourself into trouble by
firing upon them he said  there is
an easier way than that

  what is it

   starve them out my uncle said

   that might serve for a time said
welch

  he posted two men to guard us then
gave his attention to handling the ship
i crawled across to miss hollands side

   you must not think ill of my
uncle i said

  how can i think otherwise she
demanded  he has shown himself to
be a coward  

   perhaps i ventured  he is not a
coward after all just before he went
on deck he whispered to me that i was
to remain behind

   what do you mean   captain haw-
son demanded

   i think i answered  that uncle
dick has some plan perhaps he hopes
to get weapons and return with them or
to get food

   let us hope such is the case said
the captain

  if i have wronged him- ruth
holland began

   i am sure you have i interrupted
 uncle dick is not the man to be a
coward

   welch will make some move soon
the captain said  it isnt like him to
allow us to remain here without annoy-
ance

   i wish youd explain all this i
said  what was there wrong in touch-
ing that idol

   you will understand before long
ruth holland said

   but id like to know now

   not now she replied  it is too
terrible you poor boy

    dont like being called a boy i
said  what are the men doing now
they were arranging themselves in a
semicircle on the deck facing the rising
sun as we watched one of them be-
gan a chant and the others chimed in

   it is a religious ceremony miss
holland said

   the chant ccased and the spokesman
 stepped before them and looked up at
 us

    most exalted one he said  what
 is your answer-

  it is no no miss holland
 cried in reply

    we ask you to consider again

    my answer shall always be the
 same she said

   they chanted some more and then
 went about their duties i noticed that
 the spokesman held a little idol in his
 hand such a one as he had placed on
 the table in miss hollands cabin that
 night a tiny counterpart of the great
 god in the cabin below

    what is it they want you to an-
 swer i asked miss holland

    that too you must not know for
 the present she replied

   we remained there for an hour with-
 out anything of importance happening
 captain hawson piled rope and sail-
 cloth before us to make the barricade
 better and took my revolver

   there are only three cartridges
 left he said  we must save one for
 welch

    you are going to shoot him i
 asked

    only as a last resort captain haw-
 son replied  let us hope that your
 uncle is indeed trying to do something to
 help us and that he did not desert us
 through cowardice

    mr engle is back on deck cap-
 tain hawson said

   i looked down uncle dick had in-
 deed come back on deck and was walk-
 ing forward i saw the men who were
 guarding us stop him and prevent him
 from coming up to us welch came
 running forward

    what do you want to do he asked
 my uncle

    i want to get the boy lie said

   call him then dont go up
 there 

    he will not come unless i go up

    call him welch said

   uncle dick looked up at us  ro-
 land   he called

    yes sir i answered

    youd better come down here with
 me dont you think 

   i hesitated did my uncle really want
the daughter of the idol



me to come down or was it a ruse had
he told welch that story in an attempt
to get back to us

   are you coming  he asked

    i think id better remain here sir
i replied hoping that i was doing right

  i saw by the look in my uncles eyes
that i had done right he faced welch
again

   you see the boy will not come down
unless i go up for him he said  he
is frightened

   ill go up for him welch said

  he started to come up my heart was
pounding at my ribs again i knew that
uncle dick wanted me to remain where
i was it was captain hawson who
came to my rescue

   welch he cried  if you come up
here ill fire upon you

   scarcely he replied laughing
 you know what would happen do you
not  

   ill take my chances the captain
replied  remain where you are 

   im coming up  welch answered
and began to climb

  i was watching my uncle as he crept
upon the two guards who were now-
standing together watching welch and
then i understood and whispered quick-
ly to the captain

  he raised the revolver welchs head
and shoulders showed

   go back  the captain commanded

  welch laughed and started to climb
on up

  the captain sprang forward and
grappled with him in a flash the two
guards had started to welchs assistance
it was the moment for which my uncle
seemed to have been waiting he hurled
one of the guards to one side securing
his revolver as he did so and in an in-
stant was upon the back of the other
hammering him over the head with the
butt of the captured gun

  the men were screaming and others
of the crew were hurrying forward
captain hawson picked welch up bod-
ily and threw him down upon the deck
he crashed against it and lay still and
uncle dick sprang up to us the two
revolvers in his possession

   we- have weapons now he said

  ruth holland plucked at his sleeve
 can you forgive me  she asked

  for doubting my courage yes for
the other no he replied

   youll always believe-that of me 

   until i know differently he an-
swered

   perhaps youll know differently some
day she told him

  captain hawson interrupted them

  eyes open here they come he
cried

  even as he spoke his revolver spoke
too the first man of the crew to at-
tempt to reach us fell back upon the
deck senseless others dashed toward
us trying to climb to where we were
uncle dicks revolver spoke then the
captain fired again and then the men
on deck rage -seizing them opened fire
upon us and the bullets whistled by and
fell about us like hail

  i do not know how it happened for
i did not feel it at the time i only
know that while i was working the re-
volver to send my last shot into the
midst of the men below my arm grew
numb suddenly and the weapon slipped
from my hand

  i grasped my right arm with my left
hand and saw that it was covered with
blood then everything grew black be-
fore me and with the shouts and shots
and curses ringing in my ears i crashed
to the deck

       chapter ix
       the last cartridge

yy hen i regained consciousness i
found myself on one of the bunks
in a cabin my arm was bandaged and
paining terribly

  it was dark in the cabin but whether
it was night i could not tell for as i
gradually discovered the one porthole
was closed and there was a heavy por-
tiere before it

  i lay still for some time allowing my
eyes to grow accustomed to the darkness
then i saw a table in the middle of the
cabin with two heavy chairs near it and
that was all

  at first i heard no sound except the
washing of the waves and the creaking
of rigging but after a time i heard
shouts and curses and the reports of gun-
fire i wondered whether my uncle and


the railroad mans magazine

 captain hawson had been really con-
 quered

   the sounds of battle grew louder it
 was evident that the combat raged on
 the deck over the cabin in which  was
 a prisoner i crawled from the bunk
 and steadying myself against the table
 and chairs made my way to the door and
 turned the knob

   the door was locked i searched the
 cabin carefully but found no weapon
 the fight on deck raged fiercely if i
 remained in the cabin my fate depended
 upon the outcome of the fight i would
 rather be an eye-witness i decided and
 in event of the combat turning against
 my interests tried to find some hiding-
 place that would serve my purpose

   again i tried the door but it was
 fastened securely just as i was at the
 point of giving up in despair there were
 steps in the passage some one fumbled
 at the door and the next instant it was
 thrown open and ruth holland stood
 just within it

   you have recaptured theship i
 asked

    you poor boy she said by way of
 answer and held me for a moment in
 her arms

    tell me what happened i implored

    your uncle and the captain fought
 them back she said  and we left our
 protection in an effort to secure control
 of the deck but the men only got fresh
 arms and ammunition and renewed the
 fight your uncle and the captain are
 making a stand on deck trying to pre-
 vent the men from driving them below

   but you came here for me

    i am going to take you into my
 cabin she said  youll be safe there
 at least until we reach our destination
 these men dare not harm me

    but uncle dick-and the captain 

    we can only hope for the best she
 said

   she put her arm around my shoulders
 and helped me out of the cabin and down
 the passage i could hear the shots and
 cries plainly now and wanted to go on
 i deck but she would not allow it she
 took me to her cabin and made me com-
 fortable on the bunk then she went
 out and closed the door

   a short time after that i- could hear

the fighting drawing nearer and realized
that my uncle and the captain had been
forced below and were defending the
passage then suddenly the firing
ceased entirely and all was still

  roland i heard uncle dick
calling

   here sir i answered

  he threw open the door and entered
his clothing was in shreds there was
dirt on his face and hands and blood
mixed with the dirt one great gash
was across his forehead

  what has happened i asked

   they i rove us down he said  and
have made us prisoners

   you mean they control the ship 

   yes they command the ship we
are like rats in a trap down here

   where is miss holland i asked

   they detained her on deck

   what will they do now

   i dont know he said

  captain hawson came into the cabin
then and he was as sorry a picture as
uncle dick

   we settled a few scores anyway
he said

   but theyll make us pay dearly for
it replied uncle dick  i dont care
for myself-i always expected it and
 dont suppose you are afraid of death
captain but the woman and the boy-
 we may be able to save them yet
the captain replied

  for several minutes nothing happened
then a streak of light came into the
passage and there was the noise of a
door slamming

  some one is coming down the cap-
tain said

  he opened the door cautiously and
peered out it was welch who came
along the passage accompanied by one
of the men captain hawson raised his
revolver

   stop where you are  he commanded
welch laughed  why should i  
he asked there are no shells in your
revolver nor in mr engles the fight
was not so swift that i didnt take time
to count the shots you fired

   then you made a mistake in your
counting for i have at least one left
the captain said  i have saved it for
vou

making the lightning hustle

by charlton c andrews

the need of an intermediate means of communication between the
telegraph and the mail is a long recognized one it has baffled
organizers to give any such service that would be adequate the
special-delivery letter was one reply to the demand but no mere acceleration
of old methods could solve the problem and organizers have had to wait for
inventors to give them the materials many have been the attempts-all
futile-until mr delany came along with his wonderful invention which
he named the telepost and by means of which an average of three thousand
words a minute can be transmitted cheaply this article is an untechriical
description of the telepost and its method of working its miracle

  system by which your stenographer can send your telegrams
  direct without the obscurity of the cut-a-word
  and save-a-cent method

k pr-bad out the morning paper
so that you can comprehend at
a single glance the quantity of
matter in small type on the
first page which if it is an
average metropolitan daily
without display advertising
will be somewhere near eight thousand
words next look at your watch while
the tiny hand at the bottom of the dial
makes the circuit which marks the flight
of sixty seconds and try to imagine the
entire contents of that newspaper page
being transmitted from new york to
buffalo over a single wire while those
sixty seconds are being ticked off if
you can do that perhaps it may help you
to appreciate the automatic telegraph
system invented by patrick b delany
of east orange and nantucket

  it may also help in appraising de-
lanys endeavors to bring the telegraph
up to date to contrast this speed of eight
thousand words a minute with nine words
a minute which is the rate at which the
average speed of the average operator
figures out according to a statement

made by the president of the western
union in april 

  to be sure what may be called the
official record of delanys automatic
telegraph is only twelve hundred words
a minute delany contents himself with
a claim of a beggarly thousand words a
minute when talking for publication but
the eight thousand words have been sent
in one minute over a line having an arti-
ficial resistance equivalent to that in a
line between buffalo and new york
what has been done once can be done
again no doubt

chasing lightning

  even a thousand words a minute is
one hundred and eleven times as fast as
an average operator can send and be it
remembered ninety-eight and a half per
cent of the telegrams transmitted in the
united states to-day are sent in the same
old primitive way that morse taught

  delany does not have to depend upon
any flimsy testimony to prove that he can
send messages at this incredible speed




the railroad mans magazine

in the first place he has the elliott cres-
son gold medal conferred upon him by
that venerable and distinguished scientific
body the franklin institute of phila-
delphia in recognition of his achievement
he has also a report of the committee
on science and arts signed by the chair-
man of the committee and the president
and secretary of the institute and bear-
ing its seal certifying that the committee
after due investigation found the appa-
ratus capable of transmitting and re-
ceiving over a single wire twelve hundred
words a minute

  any one unwilling to accept this docu-
ment as conclusive may find delanys
instruments in daily use in boston low-
ell lawrence and haverhill massachu-
setts  exeter portsmouth and dover
new hampshire biddeford saco old
orchard and portland maine  st louis
and sedalia missouri springfield ill-
inois and terre haute indiana where
they may make observations and verify
them on their own account to their hearts
content

beginning of a revolution

  lines now in use between these various
cities are the beginning of a system which
will soon reach from boston by way of
new york chicago st louis and kan-
sas city to san francisco and ultimately
throughout the entire country but the
new company isnt saying much about
its proposed routes like many another
corporation it has learned to its cost that
the value of a right of way increases as
the square of its desire to purchase

  this new telegraph company organ-
ized with a capital of eighteen million
dollars is known as the telepost be-
cause it has been the dream of delanys
life to combine the swift transmission of
the ideal telegraph wire with the well-
organized delivery service of the united
states post-office for correspondence
service will at all times be quick and
when desired it can be quicker

  for the quick-method messages-gath-
ered by messengers or otherwise are to
be sent over the wires to be delivered at
the other end by mail thus handled it
is a telepost passage if that isnt
speedy enough the message is sent by
wire and delivered by messenger as a

telegram in either case the charge is a
quarter no matter whether the telepost
or telegram is from new york to tren-
ton or new york to san francisco the
only difference is that in a telegram the
sender is restricted to twenty-five words
and a very limited distance for his quar-
ter  while if he is satisfied with a telepost
he can expand his thoughts into fifty
words for the money

more for less

  if he is willing to prepare his own
message for transmission in the form of
a  teletape and let the addresses tran-
scribe it from morse characters he can
send a little monograph of a hundred
words for the quarter additional words
are charged for at proportional rates

  a ten-word message can be sent by
wire and delivered by mail written on a
postal-card for ten cents the difference
between a twenty-five word telegram
from new york to san francisco for
twenty-five cents and a ten-word message
for a dollar the present rate can be
worked out by any one with a head for
figures

  the first telepost line was opened be-
tween boston and portland maine and
intermediate points october  
the service made a hit at once and since
then the system has been expanding
stealthily whenever the company could
buy a place to set a pole without appear-
ing to want to do so

some foreign usages

  france looked upon the idea and found
it good fifty-three days after the first
telepost line was opened in america the
ministry of posts and telegraphs an-
nounced that  letter telegrams  for
transmission between any two points in
france would be received at the uniform
rate of a fifth of a cent per word re-
gardless of distance the minimum charge
being ten cents these letter telegrams
arc received at any time after  pm up
to midnight to be sent by telegraph dur-
ing the night when the wires are near-
ly idle and delivered by mail in the
morning

  rumania too has the craze for cheap
telegrams -m l lots of them not being
able to think of any better scheme the	enty-three words were sent over the same

the railroad mans magazine

either in morse dots and dashes or in
perforations in the former case the
tape is moistened with a chemical solu-
tion every electric impulse brings an
iron wire in contact with the wet tape
and makes an indelible blue mark which
will not blur or run into its neighbors

  if the message is to be transcribed by
an old-time morse operator he can have
the tape punched to be fed later through
an auxiliary machine which will click it
off to him in the old familiar clatter at
any speed he chooses whenever he is
ready and which will stop for him to
light his cigarette or repeat a word as
often as he likes without a protest

  the difficulty that has tripped up so
many inventors of automatic telegraphs
was the  static charge or  capacity
or  retardation by way of explana-
tion it may be said that sending a mes-
sage over a wire is just like sending a
stream of water through a long garden
hose the water does not stop and start
the instant the tap is opened and closed
bt in gradually increasing and decreas-
ing gushes

the rebel harnessed

  this additional current leaves a record
on the receiving-tape in all other systems
and makes the message illegible this
difficulty increases with the length of the
line as the  capacity  is- proportionate
to the wire surface

  delany instead of allowing himself
to be beaten by the static charge simply
harnessed it and made it help do the
work of his machine thus practically
eliminating speed lirilits

  the scheme is covered by ljnited
states patent no  only dots
are sent over the- wire by the delany
instrument immediately after the dot
signal is sent a reverse current is sent

from the opposite pole of the battery
which neutralizes the static charge on
the line so that it does not trail nor delay

the succeeding signal

  if a dash is wanted the reverse current
is held back long enough to allow the
static charge to make a long mark on
the receiving tape thus delany catches
this disturbing element coming and going
and keeps it so busy it never gets time
to interfere with the speed

stimulating the line

  as a free horse can be ridden to death
so even a static charge my be over-
loaded if a long circuit has not the
strength to produce a dash condensers
or a parallel circuit are introduced to
help out to aky- extent required so that
the chemical tape may be used on lines
of any length so long as any current
reaches the receiving station the tape will
record it

  electric and magnetic storms bad in-
sulation and other things that interrupt
the ordinary electro-magnetic telegraph
system have no terrors for delany his
system works serenely on in perfect con-
dition so long as it is possible to get
intelligible morse signals oyer it

  a newspaper that is in a hurry to get
to press can run the tape right to the
linotype operator and let him set up the
matter right from the tape-that is if
he can read morse if he cannot an
attachment for the linotype on -which
delany is now working will take per-
forated tape and grind out the contents
in type without the intervention of a
printer

  a single wire will keep eighty-two
persons busy with the delany system
forty perforating messages for transmis-
sion forty others transcribing them by
typewriter and two attending machines

   the electric headlight is of course
far superior to the other from the stand-
point of illumination but while it is in
use upon many roads it has a long way to
go before being  generally adopted two
arguments operate against its use first be-
cause it is claimed that the powerful beam
of light is extremely disagreeable to the eyes
of an engineer approaching  the other
track in the instance of a double-track road

  the impression of this beam  the eyes
is retained for some time and it is said
that this might give rise to a false reading
of the signal lights and you will note that
electric headlights are generally encoun-
tered on single-track roads

  	no reliable data unless the re-
flector is in very good condition the oil
light is almost valueless to the engineer be-
hind it so far as indicating where he is go-
ing is concerned its main value is to indi-
cate to others the approach of the train or

a a b north abington mass

  it is often desired to ascertain the amount
of tractive power developed by a certain
size of cylinder with a given diameter of
driving-wheel irrespective of boiler pressure
this is found by the following formula

  c- x s

 -tractive power per pound mean

    d effective pressure

  in which c equals diameter of cylinder in
inches squared s equals length of stroke in
inches and d equals diameter of driving-
wheel in inches we will now apply this
to the dimensions quoted in relation to the
engine in your question and find values of
formulato be

                x 

--

                

  that is the tractive effort is  for each
pound mean effective pressure your ques-
tion gives boiler pressure at  pounds
the mean effective pressure is generally
computed at  per cent of boiler pressure
which calculated in this instance yields 
pounds therefore x
or practically  is the total tractive ef-
fort you will thus note the close approxi-
mation between the results derived from the
formula and the figures quoted by the new
haven road to simplify the above for-
mula to work out the total tractive effort
instead of tractive effort per pound mean

therefore we obtain the following

  the draw-bar pull which is frequently
quoted in connection with locomotive effi-
ciency rating is the tractive power minus

that it is smokeless e lignite which is

that is if you had forty turns  secondary
coil the voltage would be two-thirds that
of the impressed voltage in the case the

should be considered as separate coils as
they will not have any effect on current in

what is the proper side of a fire tube
boiler  which to place a patch

        i have read that it should be iuside
as it has the weight and pressure against
it the crack to be patched is three inches
long

              j mcm quebec canada

  it would be impracticable to place the
patch within the water legs of a locomotive


the railroad mans magazine

type boiler as ordinarily constructed it
might be applied to the inner side of the
shell on an occasion when a new fire-box
was put in but it is extremely doubtful if a
good job would result

  you would of a necessity make a calking
edge and as all patches due to peculiari-
ties in expansion etc are liable to leakage
this calking edge must be accessible to re-
pairs so far as applying the patch to the
inner side of a fire-box sheet it would be
very difficult as it could not be introduced
within the boiler leg

  a short crack which you mentioned might
be satisfactorily repaired by sewing it to-
gether with plugs the extreme end plugs
should drill the crack out and all plugs
introduced between them should be thread-
ed or knit into one another

  one and one-half or two threads should
be left above the sheet and then all of the
plugs should be fullered or flattened down
and edges trimmed and calked in the long
run it is always best to use a patch

a trolley

 trince is said to be the only trolley
jl dog in the united states the
emergency men of the richmond light and
railroad company believe that prince is the
smartest trolley-dog in existence

  prince was picked up by calvin obrien
stationed at the companys barns at tomp-
kinsville staten island

the horses of the outfit and prince seem
to feel that they are fellow workers ac-
cording to the doubtless veracious news-
paper report from which we take this story
 the two horses used in the emergency

in the march  number both of the
above answers referred to are quite lengthy
and space limits forbid reproduction here

  it is pretty hard to say just where the
weakest point is in a locomotive-boiler it
is all designed with five as a factor of
safety that is to withstand strains five
times greater than the alloted steam pres-
sure there was one purposely bursted by
hydraulic pressure  one occasion for a
test and it is said to have given way on one
of the cylindrical courses

  this may give you some information if
you merely desire an opinion we would
think that it would let go first along the
mud-ring but the probability of any such
thing occurring in any portion of the boiler
is extremely remote with good inspection
and proper care

cc b abilene texas-the sketch of

	the switch you have patented has
been examined with interest and we have
consulted at least one railroad supervisor in
regard to it he has no doubt that the
switch will operate as you claim but thinks
that the high rails which will be necessary
will prove an obstacle to low pilots these
latter are supposed to clear the rails four
inches at the heel and five inches at the
point but they dont always do so

  you need have no concern in regard to
the brake-beams as they will clear our
own opinion is that it will likely prove a
rough-riding switch at high speed if indeed
high speed will be practicable over it

  take the idea to the chief engineer of any
railroad or failing to reach him to any
division engineer and try to secure an ex-
pression of approval thereupon you should
endeavor to interest some manufacturer of
patent switches and crossings whose ad-
vertisements you will find in the railroad
age-gasette and other railway technical
publications

jimmy collins got into
rosedale ask him and
hell tell you he didnt
know himself anyway
big bill bennett found
him asleep one night after no  had
pulled out outside the baggage - room
door and brought him up to me

  it was a bitter cold night the mer-
cury was crowding the bottom of the
glass

   it had been snowing for two days the
yard was full of freights and every pas-
senger that went out had a plow and
flanger-car on ahead we asked the
crew of no  when they came back the
next day if any of them had seen col-
lins but as no one seemed to recall see-
ing him on the train we concluded he
had come in  blind baggage  from
somewhere east	

  i	was trainmaster at rosedale then
and on account of the weather and to
help the despatcher out  was staying
down at the station that night one
despatcher was laid up with the fever
and when a man was sick then we had
to double up and get along the best way
we could

  it was just after the strike and we
were short of men some of the strikers
we had taken back  others we had not
it seemed a good opportunity to get rid
of some of the deadwood things had
not been running as they should for you
cant have a strike and with a lot of new
men keep the same schedules as with
the old ones the repair - shops were
crowded to the roof with only half a
working force inside and most of them
new men at that

   	r r

  bennett brought collins into my of-
fice i had been sitting in at the key
from six until ten which left the other
two boys with a ten-hour trick instead of
eight davis had just relieved me and
as i went into my office bennett came in
with collins

  we thawed him out after a time its
pretty hard to thaw out a man full of
whisky that had started to freeze but
we did it-and found he was only a boy
instead of a man

  he slept on the lounge in my office
that night and the next morning hit me
for a job and the price of a breakfast
at the same time

  	theres no room on this division for
a man who drinks i told him  weve
too many of that kind here now

  he tried all the heads but no one
would take him on after they heard the
story no one really wants a man who
drinks and this is particularly true on
the railroad that didnt seem to feeze
collins any for every one who turned
him down for a job lent him enough
money for a feed and a bed and that
kept him going until ecbstimson finally
gave him a job handling freight

  after a time charlie root the yard-
master gave him a job in the yard and
from there he got into the roundhouse
wiping he was a railroad man all
right we could all see that at a glance
and every time he saw dave sanders the
division master mechanic hed ask him
for a place somewhere on the motive-
power his talk was all to the point-
railroad a yard wide and a foot thick

   why i was fed on railroad when i
was a kid hed say  i rode in an
engine-cab instead of a go-cart and the


the railroad mans magazine

only plaything i ever had was a railroad
spike

  after sanders had turned him down
several times hed get a little mad and
say to him

  all right sanders i was running
an engine when you was in the ditch
with a pick and shovel and when i get
up ill put you back where you belong

  that may be collins but ive got
the engine now and youre in the ditch
sanders would answer  and if i was
fool enough to give you an engine id
belong in the ditch

  he stayed wiping for six months but
on promising sanders to cut out the
drink lie put him on firing for adam
crosby but whats the promise of a
man that drinks he wants to get away
from it all right but he cant do it nine
times out of ten that was the way
with collins -he wanted to quit but
couldnt first he used to drink on the
sly carried a bottle around on his hip
then when he found he wasnt pulling
the wool over any ones eyes he got it
openly over the bar at bat murphys

  but drunk or sober he got down and
fired his engine all day and crosby used
to say hed rather have collins fire for
him when he was dead drunk than any
other man when he was dead sober-
and crosby was the hardest engineer to
fire for on the division

  collins lived with mrs mcmullen
and her daughter katie when mc-
mullen went down in the cedar flats
wreck mrs mcmullen took a little
house near the station with the money she
got from his benefit and rented rooms
and gave meals to a few single railroad
men

  rosedale wasnt exactly what you
might call a growing town  it grew in
one way-small but that isnt the kind
of growing that makes a good lively
town or induces the real-estate agents to
invest in trotting horses

  when the mines were opened at pay-
down most of the floating population
went there only a few railroad men and
storekeepers that had business there re-
mained

  in the first place rosedale had only
one excuse or perhaps two for being on
the map at all one was the railroad
and the other the river it seemed a

logical place for a division when the
road went through the town started off
with a boom but the boom soon gave
out and left rosedale high and dry on
the desert the people couldnt stand
the sage-brush and alkali most of them
came from where there was green grass
and trees and when they saved enough
money they went home

  the road was run up the canon of
eagle river and at the foot of the
mountains where it turns abruptly to-
ward the south it is joined by porcupine
creek the creek flows along quietly in
its narrow bed for the greater part of
the year but when the soft chinook
blows through the mountain passes the
spring sun mounts higher in the sky and
the warm rains come then the snow
melts like a stick of candy in a boys
mouth and the porcupine becomes a
swollen yellow torrent overflowing the
flats and lapping the very doors of rose-
dale itself

  eagle river during countless ages
has chiseled for itself out of the soft
limestone rock a deep canon into which
the porcupine drops with a graceful fall
of sixty feet down the almost perpen-
dicular walls the enterprising youth of
rosedale during its leisure hours has
cut a series of steps leading to a bench
carved out of the solid rock

  barring katie mcmullen it is the one
beautiful thing in rosedale

  the first bridge over the porcupine
lasted six months for it was completed
late in the year when the first spring
thaws came and the snow-bound country
broke loose almost in a single night the
rushing water carrying trees and boul-
ders embedded in blocks of ice weighing
a ton or more came tearing down the
creek with an irresistible force and the
bridge- went out like a house of cards

  a heavy freight special coming east
that night rounded the curve three hun-
dred yards above and thundered down
the grade for a plunge into the icy waters
of the creek-and took it too

  the engineer saw the broken track
threw the air whistled the alarm and
shouted for the fireman to jump with
the brake-shoes spitting fire from every
wheel the engine and heavy train
plunged into the muddy boiling water
below
jimmy collins and the 



  when the water went down a week
after we found the engineer with his
hand on the throttle his head on his
arm-asleep

  but this is all changed the porcu-
pine has as good a bridge over it as any
on the division when the water flows
back up the mountain then this bridge
will go out-perhaps

collectively and individually had laid
themselves at her feet

  katie had her own ideas of a wedding
however and one by one they had given
her up to find consolation or otherwise
in some lesser light of rosedale it
was different with collins though he
never gave anything up you may call
it nerve or just piain natural dogged

big bill bennett found him asleep one night after no  had pulled out

  collins like many another good man
was his own worst enemy his heart
was in the right place and as big as his
whole body and there wasnt a man on
the division whom he couldnt call his
friend drunk or sober he was always
good - natured  and if a yardman got
pinched or a car-tink was laid up with
rheumatism he was right there with the
goods

  katie mcmullen was nineteen years
old then with hair as black as an egyp-
tian night a complexion as brown as a
russet apple eyes as limpid as a moun-
tain lake and with a figure like a greek
goddess

  those eyes had been the undoing of
almost every boy on the division who

persistence or anything you like but
ive noticed that the man that gets the
thing he wants is the man that camps on
its trail

  collins certainly camped on her trail
and when hed get his check and pay his
board for two weeks back and two weeks
ahead as he always did it generally car-
ried with it a proposal to katie she
couldnt see it in that light however and
collins would have to seek consolation
in bat murphys fire-water

  in spite of his habits collins won
sanders over and he gave him the
switcher when dan payton had to give
her up  account of blindness she
was an old tub-no one would deny that
her many trips to the repair-shop had


the railroad mans magazine

left scarcely an original piece of iron in
her frame and almost always at critical
places she would be sure to break some-
thing

  she steamed badly at all times re-
fused to work at all on some occasions
and it would break the back of any ordi-
nary fireman to keep the steam-dial at a
hundred and seventy

  some engineers couldnt do anything
with her at all but collins from the
first day he climbed into her cab had
an influence over her such as some people
have over an animal she did his bid-
ding with hardly a groan of protest

  collins was by no means a careful
man at the throttle but somehow he
managed to escape any serious accident
a green lamp meant to him only that he
should keep a sharp lookout and with
a clear track in sight he would run past
a dozen horizontal semaphores only to
bring his engine up with a jerk right at
the point of danger sanders warned
him many a time about this

  youll do that once too often col-
lins  and as sure as you break anything
in this yard back youll go to wiping

   youre always knocking sanders
wait until i smash something and then
you can make all the row you want to

best engines to the scrap-heap

  to make it worse some changes were
made at headquarters at this time a
new general manager was installed and
economy was preached from the division
superintendent down to the car - tinks
economy with the motive-power fit for
the hospital and the road-bed hardly fit
to run a trolley over to say nothing
of the heavy through passengers and
freights

  material for construction or repairs
was not to be had and a requisition for
a steel rail took weeks instead of days to
go through sam higgins the road-
master said you might as well ask for
a double track through eagle canon
as for an extra section-gang and we
were using sweepers for firemen and
hoboes for switching-crews

  the new general manager was report-
ed to know his business down to the
ground but to us-he was an unknown
quantity both as to work and appear-
ance for we had never seen him or heard
anything about him until he came on
our line

  some easy-chair railroad man from
a swell road in the east where they have
four tracks silver-plated telegraph-keys
and the men have nothing to do and
six men to help them do it when he
sees this division hell wish he had stayed
there charlie root said

  rumor of his coming was a daily oc-
currence at our division headquarters
but he seemed to be cleaning up nearer
his end and did not get so far west
if what we heard was true i guess they
needed it there official heads had been
dropping in the basket nearer home and
some of us trembled in our boots for our
jobs when he should see the condition
of the red rock division but we did
the best we could under the circum-
stances

  we had put some  hunkies  grading
on the spur out of paydown in place of
some italians who had struck they
didnt have any real grievance but a
boss they had knowing we were hard
put and wanted to get the track laid
thought it would be a good opportunity
to squeeze the company a little so they
went out

  the company had built a shack for
the  dagoes  about two miles out of
paydown and as they had it and
seemed disposed to keep it we didnt
have a place to put the  hunkies so
we would bring them down to rosedale
at night and run them back in the morn-
ing

  the dagoes had made us a little
trouble but nothing serious and we ex-
pected to get rid of them without any
disturbance

  rosedale lies in a valley with the
jimmy collins and tiie 



wapiti hills on the west and the elk
river range  the east there is a
grade down the eagle river cafion of
something over a hundred and fifty feet
to the mile from rosedale the road
stretches away east for three miles on
almost a dead level then runs into the

and micky okeefe was put in to shovel
the diamonds he was a sweeper in the
roundhouse and as green a boy as ever
came out of ireland

  he knew the difference between a
draw-bar and a steam-chest and well-
that was about all he had fired on a

he wanted to quit but couldnt

foot-hills of the elk river range with
the worst grade  the division takes a
little dip into willow park then runs
around the middle of turtle mountain
on a track blasted out of the face of the
cliff

  macarthur was marked up that night
to help a freight over the grade to pay-
down and bring back the  hunkies
his fireman had reported sick that day

steam-roller in new york for six months
when he first came over here  and one
day when the engineer was absent for
a few moments he backed the roller
over a fire-alarm post and made a good
attempt to climb into a millinery estab-
lishment by way of the plate-glass win-
dow after that the contractor let him
go and he came out west to learn the
railroad business


the railroad mans magazine

  macarthur coupled on an old smoker
then used for a work-car and helped
push the freight up the grade to pay-
down the striking  dagoes thinking
they were getting the worst of it had
been rowing and worrying the  hun-
kies  all day and as they crowded into
the car glad to get away from them the
 dagoes  started to rush them

  macarthur had stepped into the sta-
tion for a few moments to see if there
were any orders and okeefe thinking
he would shake the  dagoes  off by
pulling down the track a piece and then
come back for macarthur opened the
throttle a notch or so and latched it up

  as he did so the leader of the
dagoes jumped into the -cab and

grabbed him they clinched and both
rolled out of the cab onto the ground
before okeefe could disentangle him-
self and get on his feet the engine was
on the grade gaining speed with every
revolution of the drivers some of the
 hunkies seeing what had happened
jumped but the majority stayed in the
car there were about seventy-five left

  it was about seven oclock and just
getting dark root and i were in the
division superintendents office listening
to taylor an old miner tell of a winter
he spent in the canadian rockies when
a messenger entered and handed whitney
two tissues with an exclamation he
jumped to his feet thrust the despatches
into my hand and ran from the room i

always carried with it a proposal to katie

 it was just  toss-
 ing the tissues at root i
 followed whitney into
 the despatehers office

   roberts had the night
 trick then from six until
 two and he was trying
 to get birchwood as i
 came in that was the 
 only station between caxton and rose-
 dale where there was a night operator
 and he usually left the office at seven
 oclock for his supper whitney was
 standing over the sounder his face
 drawn and pale as it clicked bd bd
 bd followed by the despatchers call-
 three long dashes

  before we in the office had hardly
 realized the situation it was known out-
 side that a wild engine was against a
 special and the boys began to rile into
 the office the clock ticking off the
 seconds seemed like hours while we wait-
 ed breathlessly for an answer from
 birchwood

   none came  and roberts with beads
 of perspiration standing out on his face
 like drops of dew on the grass his hands
 shaking as with the palsy looked from
 one to the other with a silent appeal in
 his eyes

   at this moment collins fairly drunk
 pushed through the crowd to the little
 group around the despatehers desk and
 in a loud voice asked whats all this
 excitement about

   some one caught him by the coat-tails
 and pulled him over to one side tilling
 him that macarthurs engine was run-

wild against the
general managers spe-

cial

you wont need the wrecker

and crew

                     wheres m a c a r -
                 thurs engine now he
                 asked coming over to-
                 ward the desk again

                  it was out of pay-

               swered looking at his

              that can be found and
              then try birchwood
              again  whitney said
              rapidly

 roberts called t h e
 roundhouse captain and
 ordered an engine a
 crew-caller was sent after anderson and
 then roberts tried birchwood again
  bd bd bd clicked the instrument

    ii pd instantly came the answer
 and we thought for a moment we had
 them cornered

   flag special no is quick rob-
 erts fired at him with lightning speed

   every man in the room whether he
 could read the dots and dashes or not
 leaned forward to get the answer it
 came slowly terribly slow and when
 roberts did get it he uttered a groan
 for the message he received was only

    send slower could not get mes-
   sage

  flag special no  quick he
 sent slower and then leaned forward as
 if to help him get the red light out
 after an instants pause birchwood sent
 again

    special no - then the wires
 went wrong the relay spluttered in an
 un distinguishable mass of dots and
 dashes and we like the good railroad
 men we were drew a full breath and
 cursed the wires at the same time

whether he had held special no is
	the railroad mans magazine

 or whether she had gone by left us in a
 terrible state of doubt

  here it is roberts said as the
 wires came right again

special no  went through here at



 some one suggested throwing a switch
 and sending the wild engine into a string

as he passed through he turned his head
and called over his shoulder

   you wont need the wrecker 

  no one paid any attention to him
but i watched him as he walked un-
steadily over to the truck take two cans
of machine-oil consigned to the mines at
paydown and swing onto his engine
collins tried the air opened the cyl-

ww ylc jl p - -fm

of flats that was on the siding but to
send a wild engine into a string of flats
was one thing and to send the same-
plus a car-load of human beings into
the empties-was -quite another

  collinss engine stood on the siding
just opposite the station with her nose
to the east the fireman was dozing on
the box and on the platform stood a
truck-load of express matter

collins pushed through the crowd
again and hurried over toward the door

inder-cocks pulled open the throttle with
a jerk and old  coughing and wheez-
ing pounded across the switch onto the
main line

whitney came to and saw what had
happened he rushed out on the plat-
form waving his arms and shouting like
a madman but he was too late collins
and his engine were several hundred
yards down the stretch and as we filed
out after whitney his tail-lights disap-
peared around the curve

   collins is either drunk or crazy-
most likely both said root

  the wind brought the faint roar of
macarthurs engine coming down the
gorge and we all turned our eyes to
catch the first glimpse of her as she
poked her nose through the granite walls
whitney turned around he made for

i find you havent improved any
out here
jimmy collins and the 



the switch target a couple of hundred
feet up the platform he unlocked the
switch as the train came into full view
raising the bar he hesitated then let it
drop and came running toward us

   i couldnt do it he said  they
will have to take their chances on the
grade

  with a rush of wind and whirling
alkali-dust the engine flew by us at a
mile-a-minute clip and disappeared down
the track after collins

  the engine with the derrick and
wrecking-car puffed up to the platform
on a side-track and the men began to
pile in the tools whitney waited ten
minutes and was just swinging on ready
to give the signal to pull out when we
heard a long loud whistle from the east

   thats   ill bet my life on it 
whitney said swinging down and giving
orders for the main-line switch to be re-
set the whistle sounded again a head-
light appeared around the curve and
collins his head out of the cab-window
the whistle tooting pushing macar-
thurs engine and the car of  hunkies
pulled into the station

   give me the roundhouse track  he
shouted as he sped by 

  whitney gave the orders for the switch
and just then another whistle sounded
from the east in two minutes more
special no  pulled in

  as the engineer swung down from his
cab he said to me

   theres something wrong with the
track just this side of summit cut i put
on the air there for the grade and we
slid along for a hundred yards or more

  two hours earlier every railroad man
in rosedale would have wanted to see
the general manager but two hours had
passed and every man wanted to see
jimmy collins - but he had disap-
peared his fireman patsy connors
was coming down from the roundhouse
though surrounded by an admiring
group of- yardmen wipers and brake-
men as i joined them connors was
saying

   when collins came aboard i
thought he had some orders i didnt
know nothing about the wild engine
he pulled like mad up to the twelve-
mile post i never thought  would
stand the pace

   right on the worst of the elk river
grade he pulled up and said  patsy
the  is running wild behind us with
the car-load of  hunkies take this
can of oil and some waste and soap the
track good for a hundred yards

  he took one rail and me the other
and if a fly had lit on that track for a
hundred yards hed have broken his
neck

  jimmy pulled up for a couple of
hundred yards and walked back to where
i was to wait for the  we didnt
have long to wait she took the grade
blowing and puffing like a porpoise and
as soon as she hit that oil her drivers
spun like a dollar on bat murphys bar
collins climbed aboard and choked the
steam and hollered

  shes ail right patsy but a little
short of water draw the fire and ill
come down for you hustle now for
the general manager is coming west-
special-and ought to be along here  
whitney was explaining it all to gen-
eral manager hanchett in the office

   collins did you say his name was
jimmy collins-red-headed and has a
mole on his face i think i know him
send for him to come up

  a caller found jimmy in murphys

   well collins said hanchett  i
guess you remember me this is the
second time you have saved me from a
smash-up you remember the other
time back on the c and r  i had to
discharge you afterward for drinking
and i find you havent improved any out
here so ill have to do it again you
can get your time right now

  collins never said a word and started
for the door

  just a moment collins hanchett
said holding out his hand  i told you
we couldnt have a man on this line that
drinks and i meant it but we cant
afford to lose a man like you either
you come around in the morning and
mr whitney will give you an engine
of course you will have to tell him you
are a teetotaler no pledge or anything
like that just your word

  collins was too much astonished to
thank him he backed out of the room
bowing and twirling his cap in his hands

  three months after jimmy married
katie mcmullen and he kept his word
fighting the ticket-scalpers

by h a koach

assistant chairman railway ticket protective bureau

it is an axiom in law and philosophy that a matter is never settled until
it is settled right the ticket-scalpers won many temporary victories
and their dealings in corruption of employees and legislative fights weie
not always unsuccessful but the end was certain the incorruptible court
that represents the last word of the nation could not be hoodwinked into
perpetuating a  business  whose main asset was brazen dishonesty and
the only thing left for wonder is the audacity which would make the united
states supreme court a court of appeal to protect unscrupulousness

the unrelenting industry of the railway ticket protective bureau
brings about the waterloo of a parasitic and
fraudulent business

third article

who were known to have corrupted clerks
and other employees of the membership
lines this being one of the most serious
menaces to the railways

painstaking corruption

  the scalper made himself known to
each individual with whom his customer
came in contact the ticket-clerk the
station and baggage agent the gateman
the conductor-even the trainmen and
newsboys-were well known to him and
were often under personal obligations to
him for drinks cigars loans of money
and payments for services past and
future

  once he had gained a foothold his
power over them was complete and he
required of them the most devoted and
profitable servitude

  the fear of detection and denuncia-
tion kept them his tools and accomplices
in robbing the companies who paid their
scries began in october railroad man hajailnt single copiei  cent

                                  

              hile it took consid-
erable time to edu-
cate the publitt con-
science to the cupidity
of the scalpers the
constant and repeat-
ed arrests and the exposing of their
methods resulted in a rapidly waning
public confidence the public mind
was shocked when it began to realize
that transactions with ticket - scalpers
involved participation to a greater or
less degree in frauds upon railroads

  reputable commercial houses were en-
lightened as to the unlawful practises of
the scalpers and they no longer regarded
them as conducting honest business
numerous firms who formerly sent their
traveling men to scalpers offices to pur-
chase railway transportation withdrew
their patronage

  the activities of the ticket protective
bureau were called upon in many in-
stances to aid in the detection of scalpers
fighting the ticket - scalpers



salaries in this way the tickets which
lie manipulated often safely passed the
hands of those who should have been
the first to detect the frauds

  many promising careers of young
railroad employees were ruined by their
acquaintance with these scalpers only
recently a former railway employee was
convicted of the robbery of a number of
railroad stations after his conviction
he admitted to the writer that the sug-
gestion to rob these stations first came
from a scalper who promised him rich
rewards for the tickets secured in this
manner

a try-on that missed

  through the sources of information
possessed by the bureau these stolen
tickets were recovered from the scalper
in question and returned to the railroad
from which they were stolen the
young man who committed the robbery
was sentenced to an indeterminate sen-
tence of from ten to twenty years in the
penitentiary

  not long ago a conductor with whom
i was riding told me of an experience
he had about two years ago when one
of the scalpers called on him and offered
to pay him one dollar for each ticket he
would pass without questioning the pas-
senger holding it stating that he would
mark the ticket in such a way that the
conductor would know it came from his
office

   after listening quietly to the scheme
the conductor asked the scalper which
window he would prefer to be thrown
from and promptly reported the over-
tures made him to his superior officers
it is to be regretted that many employees
did not have this sense of loyalty but
listened to the siren song of  easy
money only to be exposed by the very
men with whom they were in collusion
when it was to their advantage so to do

giving the countersigns

   that their patrons should carry proper
means of identification in case they were
questioned by conductors was an impor-
tant item with the scalpers and they
went to considerable expense and trouble
in providing such identification they

would send to each other through the
mails envelopes addressed lightly in lead-
pencil this original address would be
erased and the name desired would be
substituted in ink

   the passenger on being questioned by
the conductor would pull out a number
of these envelopes purporting to contain
letters received by him from various
parts of the country as proof that he was
the party in question or present fake
business - cards which had been printed
by the scalper after they had passed
the scrutiny of the conductor they would
be returned to the scalper who would
send them out with the next passenger
in the same way

   it was generally believed by the rail-
roads that the introduction of what was
known as  safety paper  for their
tickets would solve the problem and pre-
vent alterations while it is true that
this safety paper could not be purchased
excepting at printing - offices authorized
by the railroad lines it was not proof
against manipulation by acids or erasures
and it could easily be recolored its only
safety was that it could not be purchased
and used by unauthorized persons hence

	complete issue of forged tickets could
be placed  the market

   more recently however after consid-
erable time and expense had been in-
curred in experiments a more reliable
safety paper has been manufactured and
adopted by the railway lines which will
aid considerably in preventing alteration
of tickets by acids and erasures

cumbersome preventives

  the introduction of what was known
as iron-clad signature form of tickets
non - transferable requiring the original
purchaser to re-sign the ticket in the
presence of the agent before the ticket
could be used for the return journey
and the validation of these tickets by the
railroad agent was also believed to be
a protective feature which would pre-
vent the tickets from falling into the
hands of the scalpers

   but these validating offices not only
incurred an expense to the railroads but
considerable annoyance to the traveling
public and did not prevent the scalpers
from dealing in this form of tickets


the railroad mans magazine

facsimile validation stamps agents sig-
natures punches and all the parapher-
nalia used by the regular validating
agents were promptly duplicated by the
scalpers and the validation of tickets
when needed was easily accomplished
with the aid of this forged outfit

  even when the validation stamps were
changed daily by the railroads pace was
kept by the scalper with forged stamps
and it was customary for many of them
to employ an engraver who went from
city to city working solely for these
crooks making such stamps

indefatigable crooks

  with a few simple tools-such as car-
bon-paper for tracing fine pens and
regular printers ink-the printing and
even the validation stamps on a ticket
could be perfectly imitated and the al-
terations became an art in fine pen-and-
ink work and careful tracing on the part
of the scalpers

  it became an incessant continual daily
battle between the railroad agents and
the scalpers and as quick as a new
safety device was found by the railroads
a new method of overcoming it was in-
vented by the scalpers

  to guard against successful search of
their offices when raids were made the
scalpers changed their methods and
would not permit the alteration of tickets
cii their own premises securing rooms in
near-by hotels where the work was done
or having rooms directly over their
ticket-offices to which entrance could be
gained only through a trap - door by
means of a ladder which could be
pulled up

tickets fixed to order

               

  in these rooms which were connected
with the regular scalping-office by pri-
vate telephone tickets were  fixed  to
order when a customer wished to pur-
chase a ticket the proprietor or clerk
would step to his telephone and ostensi-
bly call up the railroad company over
whose road the passenger wished to
travel requesting that a ticket by that
line be sent to his office in time say for
the five oclock train

  of course the unsuspecting passenger

believed that the transaction was straight
and would pay his money being asked to
return for his ticket about four-thirty
in the meantime the fixer in the
upper room would prepare a ticket which
would be delivered when called for and
which of course was forged or altered
to suit the case

relied on human nature

  about all the dishonest scalper cared
for was to get the ticket fixed so it
would pass inspection at the gate and
permit the holder to board the train not
caring if the deception was discovered
later and the passenger forced to pay
full fare or be put off the train usually
the man or woman who buys a ticket
from a scalper and gets into trouble
never comes back

  country publications were religiously
canvassed for editorial transportation
by means of circular letters which is
better explained by the letter below sent
out by a well-known chicago scalper i
cannot resist the temptation of giving
one vigorous reply received from the edi-
tor of a texas publication

paying for passes

 the scalpers communication read as
follows capitals and underscoring being
given exactly as in the original

    dear sir 

   we take this liberty of addressing
  you under the impression that you have
  some editorial transportation to dis-
  pose of

   we are credited with paying the
 highest market prices for this class of
 stock and having a large patronage of
 lirst-class people accustomed to the
 using of same we are in a position to
 handle any amount

    it might be well to add that our past
  experience with editorial mileage and
  trip tickets has been a very successful
  one this is due to the fact that we are
  very conservative and precautions in
  disposing of same as we never sell to
  any but persons known to us

   should you have any mileage trip
  tickets or transportation of any na-
  ture or are in a position to procure
  any communicate with us and h e
  will offer you liberally and promptly
fighting the ticket-scalpers



   we have been established since
    and all transactions of above
  nature rest assured will be strictly con-
  fidential yours respectfully

the editors wrath

  the reply to which i refer was as
follows

     sirs 

    i have your letter september 

    you are evidently laboring under a
  misapprehension

    this is a journal of opinion and a
  legitimate publication it does not fake
  its business nor does it invite com-
  munication with fakers

    i do not know why you should have
  invited us to enter into partnership
  with you in an effort to rob the railroad
  companies for ifwe have ever missed
  an opportunity to hold your business
  up to the contempt of the honest public
  we sincerely regret having done so

    i note with some regret your state-
  ment that your past experience with
  editorial mileage and trip tickets has
  been a very successful one if this
  statement be true i am forced to the
  conclusion that there are as big
  scoundrels in the newspaper business
  as in yours

    in the hopes that the above state-
  ments are sufficiently explicit to pene-
  trate even your understanding i am
  very truly yours

no compromise

  after a careful study and investiga-
tion of the situation the executive board
of the railway ticket protective bureau
came to the conclusion that there was
but one means of protection from the
impositions practised by the scalpers anil
that was their absolute elimination

  all other preventative measures were
found to be simply palliative if these
scalpers who so adroitly pandered to the
public prejudice who solicited and in-
cited betrayal of trust  the part of
railway employees and who seemed to
be able to obtain the cooperation of a
considerable percentage of the traveling
public in the consummation of their im-
positions upon the railways were driven
from their illegitimate vocation there
would be no necessity for applying pro-
tective measures to the tickets

  the bureau was therefore obliged to
wage warfare against the entire business
of ticket-scalping believing with the in-
terstate commerce commission who in-
vestigated the business of ticket brokers
through a commission appointed in 
and who stated their conclusions in their
annual report for that year as follows

the official fraud

    in whatever aspect ticket - scalping
  may be viewed it is fraudulent alike in
  its conception and in its operation

     fraud therefore is the incen-
  tive to the business    one might
  suppose that a practise of this character
  could  more be defended than larceny
  or forgery but strange as it may ap-
  pear it is defended before legislative
  bodies and elsewhere and the right to
  carry it on unmolested is demanded

  the bureau has been effectual in se-
curing temporary restraining orders in
state and federal courts prohibiting
the scalpers from dealing in all -
transferable tickets issued at less than
tariff rates on the occasion of some spe-
cial gathering such as the meeting of
the grand army of the republic and
similar affairs

  these restraining orders were fol-
lowed by applications in both state and
federal courts for permanent injunc-
tions and whenever they have been
granted it has practically eliminated the
ticket-scalpei making his business so un-
profitable that he has been obliged to
abandon the field in a large measure

check two

  antiscalping laws were passed by a
number of states through the efforts of
the bureau among them being the state
of oregon notwithstanding this a
number of scalpers endeavored to open
ticket-scalping offices in portland during
the lewis and clarke exposition in 

  the usual tactics were followed -by
the scalpers when the bureau inaugurated
an aggressive campaign against them
they questioned the constitutionality of
the antiscalping law i his decision
circuit judge frazer not only declared
that the antiscalping law represented a
due and proper exercise of the constitu-

tional authority of the state but com-
mended the measure as justly and wisely
interdicting an illegitimate business

  the advertising columns of the daily
papers in many of the larger cities are
still used by them as a means of buying
stock and selling tickets a few offices
are conducted openly in conjunction with
other lines of business the claim being
made by the scalper that he does not
handle any tickets which have been en-
joined by law and nothing but such
full-fare tickets as the railroads com-
monly issue

mate in two moves

  applications for perpetual injunc-
tions which were broad enough to in-
clude all non-transferable tickets sold at
reduced rates for all time were hotly
contested by the scalpers they admit-
ted that temporary injunctions covering
only tickets issued for a certain event
could be secured and that they would
not contest such injunctions this how-
ever would have necessitated the rail-
roads applying for injunctions daily

  many of the district courts were sat-
isfied to grant these permanent injunc-
tions but the entire question was finally
brought to a hearing before the united
states supreme court by the scalpers
themselves in a suit which was instituted
against one biherman and other scalpers
in new orleans enjoining them from
dealing in non-transferable reduced-fare
passenger tickets

the eastern district of louisiana decided
that while the practise was wrong legal
relief could be secured by a separate
action for every unlawful sale the
case was taken to the united states cir-
cuit court of appeals its decision was
favorable to the railroads the court
holding that the wrong-doing was of a
continuous nature and granting a per-
manent injunction  he scalpers then
appealed the case to the united states
supreme court which was unanimous in
sustaining the decision of the united
states circuit court of appeals

the

  the new york commercial comment-
ed on this decision in an editorial from
which the following is quoted

    this ends one of the most vigor-
  ously fought-one might almost say
  viciously fought-legal battles iiu-the
  history of american transportation
  and it is a complete and crowning vic-
  tory for the railroad companies it is
  one also in which the vast majority
  of the public will share the satisfaction
  of the railroads albeit there is an al-
  most universal disposition to buy any
  commodity in the cheapest market
  and the eyes of the average man or
  woman are easily and conveniently
  closed at the moment to any immorality
  involved in accepting transportation
  from a carrier in return for a ticket
  improperly acquired still the average of
  humankind has a keen perception of
  exact justice and will not defend or
  commend this practice in the abstract
  and most travelers on american lines
  will at least be heartily glad that the
  standing temptation to them to beat
  the railroads  has at last been removed
  as  no man eer felt the halter draw
  with good opinion of the law it will
  only be the scalpers themselves who
  will protest that their rights have been
  trodden upon and that the  great and
  powerful corporations  have beaten
  them to a standstill

     this decision means practically that
   a scalped railroad passenger ticket
   is still the property of the original sel-
   ler the  scalper  consequently has
   no rights  standing  business in
   any court-state territorial or federal
   the whole army of them will have to
   go out of business in fact a business
   that they have built up to enormous pro-
   portions its ramifications being through
   every nook and corner of the country
   and its conduct entailing correspond-
   ing enormous losses  the railroad
   companies

     the decision frees the transportation
   business of a huge parasite that has
   been feeding on its vitals-its passenger
   receipts-for years and years and rids it
   forever of an irritating and burden-
   some class of litigation which consist-
   ency commercial judgment and self-
   respect compelled the companies to
   continually carry  a business- that
   finally  wins out in a contest carried
   on with such tremendous odds against
   it is entitled to the sincere congratula-
   tion of every other class and form pf
   enterprise similarly subject to preda-
   tory assault

   the courts like the mills of the gods
may grind slowly but in the end the
grist is generally good sound justice

spending a railroads money

by t s da yton

a dignified serious hard-to-reach man-that in brief is a good
description of the treasurer of a great railroad system his multi-
tudinous duties-collecting revenue from a hundred different points
to sending out  a day  the pay-car-give him a prestige enjoyed
by  other official

    every young man entering the railroad business likes to get into the
treasurers office if he  makes good the chances are that he will work
up the ladder and get  fixed  for life for the positions are filled by sys-
tematic promotion three great elements are required however-honesty
ability and-more honesty

the sources from which a railroad corporation receives its money
how it is collected kept safe and paid out
and the men responsible for it

igures and facts shall be
  the background of this
  article the treasuries
  of the railroads of this
  country received during
  the year  -

 when the years books were
closed there remained of this vast sum
 as a surplus to be divided
among shareholders or to be used for
future needs the rest had been paid
out for wages supplies materials inter-
est dividends improvements and a num-
ber of smaller items

  i mention the year  because it is
the latest for available statistics

  the sources from which this money
comes how it is taken care of before it
is paid out and what becomes of it
are among the most interesting but least
known about things-popularly speaking
-connected with the gigantic business
of railroading

  the traffic receipts of a railroad are
fully  per cent of its income i
 the total traffic revenue was -
 of this amount the trans-
portation of freight brought in more
than two-thirds  and of
passengers 

  in addition to these there were mis-
cellaneous traffic earnings from carrying




the railroad mans magazine

the mails express matter etc amounting
to   the income of the
railroads from all other sources was but
s-less than five per cent of
the total

  a railroad collects its pay from the
public for services rendered through its
station-agents if it is for carrying
freight the receipt it gives is generally
in the form of an expense bill if it is
for the transportation of a passenger it
is a ticket these collections are almost
invariably made in cash when a firm
or individual is in receipt of consider-
able quantities of freight at regular in-
tervals an agent may be authorized to
accept the consignees checks and lo
balance accounts weekly or monthly

  at a certain time each day the agent
closes his books and  makes up  his
remittance he gathers all the cash and
checks that he lias received since the pre-
vious day retaining only the amount of
currency he is authorized to keep on
hand for the transaction of business
on his remittance-slip which he ends
with the money he lists the totals of
currency-bills coin and checks

  he places this remittance in a heavy
manila envelope especially designed for
the purpose and after cording and seal-
ing it in accordance with certain estab-
lished rules he delivers it to the express
messenger for transmission to the treas-
urer of his road or to some bank to
which he has been directed to remit in
the latter case he forwards the treasurer
a duplicate of his remittance-slip

collected by banks

  within the last three or four years
especially on many of the larger lines
the volume of money that is sent direct
to treasurers has been decreased over
two-thirds and the labors of the treas-
urers offices correspondingly lessened
by having all agents and others regular-
ly receiving money at points on the road
send their funds each day direct to one
or more designated banks

  before this custom was inaugurated
the money flowed in from all points on
the line to the treasurers office it took
approximately on any large road a
dozen heavily bonded clerks at  each
a month to check up these remittances

count the money and make the proper
entries

  the custom of having the agents and
others remit direct to one or more banks
in a financial center usually saves a rail-
road over  a year the banks
are only too glad to swell their average
daily balances by several hundreds of
thousands of dollars and even to pay
interest on the deposits besides assu-
ming the extra labor of taking care of
the hundreds of daily remittances the
banks acknowledge receipt of the money
direct to the agents also sending a du-
plicate slip to the cashiers department
of the treasurers office

small part in cash

  this decrease in the volume of actual
money that the treasurers office handles
from station-agents may be better appre-
ciated by stating that the new york
centrals traffic receipts average about
 a day over  of this
comes in from the stations and goes
direct to the banks the other 
is in checks a good many of them are
in settlement of freight and passenger
balances from other roads trackage ren-
tals etc a very small portion of this
 is in cash

  traffic balances are caused in this
wav the new york central for in-
stance receives a freight shipment whose
ultimate destination is denver on the
arrival of the merchandise at denver
the freight is paid by the consignee to
the road making delivery to him

  each road which has had a part in
transporting the shipment is entitled to
its proportion of the total amount col-
lected this division of earnings being
fixed by mutual agreement on the
other hand freight originating at den-
ver is also simultaneously being trans-
ported to new york and being collected
by the new york central

  with passengers the line selling the
ticket is the one that receives the revenue
at the end of each month each road
renders a statement of amounts collected
from through freight and passenger traf-
fic with a division of the earnings shown
thereon these statements are checked
against each other and it is ascertained
exactly what balances are due
r

spending a railroads money



  the same plan generally speaking is
followed in car rentals when an empty
car passes off the rails of the road that
owns it to those of another line the road
that has possession of it has to pay a
certain specified rental every twenty-four
hours that it is off its own tracks

  as empty cars are in transit continu-
ally the balances in this account are also
struck monthly and settled by checks

  another traffic source of revenue is
from the rental of trackage rights or
other facilities to other lines some of
these leases bring in considerable sums
but they are comparatively insignificant
when compared with the aggregate re-
ceipts

revenue from waste

  such are the principal traffic sources
of revenue the income from other di-
rections - about five per cent of the
whole as has been stated-is made up
of odds and ends the sale of scrap
is one of these every railroad accumu-
lates large quantities of worn-out and
useless material-mostly metals-which
is sold periodically some of the great
systems receive over  a year
from this source

  the money derived by the railroads
from the sale of their capital stock and
from bond issues is not a current in-
come and therefore cannot be included
in their revenues such funds however
come into the custody of the treasurer
like all others they are always used
for some specific purpose such as the
building of new lines permanent im-
provements renewals of rolling stock
etc

  their amount varies from year to
year the total capital stock of the
american railways in  was nearly
 and their bonded indebt-
edness a little over 

  the last few years the average in-
crease in capitalization has been about
 the bonded debts of all
the railways in this country was -
 larger in  than the year
previous during the nine years before
that the average annual increase in
bonded indebtedness was 

  a railroads income is principally de-
rived as has been shown from one great

source traffic its outgo is in many and
varied directions whose ultimate object
is to adequately take care of its business

  in  there were  people
employed by  railroads of america
they received in wages that year -
 or about forty per cent of all
the money that the railroads received
the average daily wages for all classes
of workmen and- employees was 

  the next greatest item of expense was
for materials and supplies this
amounted to about  the
remainder after taking out the -

	surplus amounted to nearly
s of this amount there
was paid in interest on bonds -

	other interest  divi-
dends  taxes took -
 rentals of all sorts 
and miscellaneous expenditures -


  these figures do not include the pur-
chases of new rolling stock or all bet-
terments in track or other permanencies
they do include however the mainte-
nance of the properties and all that
pertains thereto  how these various
disbursements are made may be best de-
scribed by outlining the organization and
duties of the treasurers department of
a large railroad

  the head of this department is the
person who is finally responsible for re-
ceiving caring for and disbursing all of
a railroads money he is the chief
financial officer generally one of the
vice-presidents and also a member of
the board of directors or even of the
executive committee he usually ranks
next to the president

treasurer not a  railroader

  he may be the direct representative
of some person or group of persons who
have a large or a controlling interest in
the road it is generally recognized that
an able financier in the treasurers chair
can do quite as much as any other officer
toward insuring a roads prosperity
therefore a treasurer is frequently se-
lected more for his experience and abil-
ity in this line which he may have
achieved in banking circles than for his
familiarity with railroad routine

  in fact he is the only executive who

 rr


the railroad mans magazine

need not be a railroader his salary
ranges from  to  a year
according to the importance of the line
or the system

  a treasurer does no routine work him-
self he does not hold himself aloof
from the public but he sees only a few
people and those on business of moment
he has less callers than any other of-
ficial

  it is a treasurers task to plan so that
every contingency of the financial future
can be met adequately and at once in
good times and in bad in a word he
must keep the roads finances so that
every debt can be paid the moment it
falls due

interest on bonds

  as fast as the money comes in it must
be deposited where it will be safe and
immediately available when needed it
must be placed where it will be earning
the highest practicable rate of interest
the huge average daily balances of the
railroads with the banks are like great
call loans with such institutions and are
very desirable on both sides

  it was the treasurer of an eastern road
who first devised and put into practise
the plan of having the station-agents re-
mit directly to the banks thus accom-
plishing two things that do not seem to
amount to much but which really mean
a good many thousands a year in the
aggregate one is cutting down ex-
penses and the other is gaining a days
interest on a large sum of money say
 at two per cent a year

  another important part of a treas-
urers work is regulating judiciously the
disbursement of funds a considerable
portion of the gross monthly receipts is
hot always available some is in transit
some is liable to be called for unexpect-
edly on large contracts that are being
completed and so on

  a treasurer has to keep a firm grasp
on the situation and not only provide out
of current receipts for the payment of
wages and -sundry bills but also to be
ready to meet the interest on bonds or
to pay the dividends on stocks whenever
they fall due

  the interest on a railroads bonds has
to be paid either every six months or

annually the amount of this periodical
disbursement is known exactly and
funds must be provided for it no matter
what happens failure to pay this in-
terest is looked upon as a confession of
insolvency and is usually followed by
foreclosure on the part of the bond-
holders and the appointment of a re-
ceiver

  while these interest payments amount
to only about one-tenth of the gross
revenue of the average road the other
payments for wages supplies material
equipment and a thousand and one
other things are so large that they have
to be carefully looked after and watched
over so that sufficient funds shall always
remain to meet the interest when it falls
due

  no important expenditure is even con-
templated without first consulting with
the treasurer and being assured that the
money will be available with many
roads a portion of the revenue must be
set aside in what is called a sinking fund
out of which a certain number of bonds
must be paid each year

needs a keen mind

  this is another burden in addition to
the annual interest charge when money
has to be raised by the sale of bonds or
stock it is one of the duties of the treas-
urer-in conjunction with the board of
directors or the president-to negotiate
the loans the bonds represent for the
length of time that may be necessary

  his is also the hand on the helm when
stock is to be sold and upon his astute-
ness depends in a great degree its reali-
zing the proper market-price

  the treasurer and his assistants and
their subordinates dwell continually in
the midst of alarms lest some mishap be-
fall the interests that they must safe-
guard conscientiously from the highest
to the lowest they are beset with the
vexations and worries that are the por-
tion of every man who is directly or
indirectly the custodian of anothers
money

  yet curiously enough in no other de-
partment of a railway is there so much
eagerness to gain a foothold of employ-
ment and so few resignations the men
who enter the treasurers department as
spending a railroads money



youths almost invariably continue there
until they die or are retired as pensioners
after long and faithful service

  on a big railroad the assistant treas-
urer is the one who handles personally
and through his large staff of subordi-
nates the tremendous volume of detail
work in the organization of the new
york centrals treasury department
which is typical of the high develop-
ment that has been attained in that
branch of a great railroad the assistant
treasurer has live departments under
him

  the first is the voucher department
where payments that have been author-
ized are made the second is the stock
and bond department where all the work
connected with the transfers of stock
the payment of dividends the issuance
of bonds and the payment of interest
is taken care of the third is the cash-
iers department where all money not
transmitted direct to the banks is re-
ceived the fourth is the paymasters
department which concerns itself with
the payment of wages the fifth is the
general clerical staff of the treasurers
department

  relatively speaking a big railroad
like the central sends out very few
checks instead it makes its payments
by means of vouchers these documents
briefly described show on their face for
what purpose the payment is to be made
and to whom on the back for purposes
of distribution on the books of account
is shown the heading under which it is
to be charged

sends out few checks

  these vouchers are signed counter-
signed and approved by the various
heads of departments whose activities
they touch  and when they reach the
assistant treasurer they lack only his
final approval before being changed into
paper that may be transmuted into cash
after a voucher has been recorded ex-
amined and approved by the assistant
treasurer and his staff that official stamps
it with an order on the bank authorizing
that institution to pay to the person in
whose favor the voucher is issued or to
his order the amount named therein

in this way the voucher does not re-

turn to the treasurers department of
the railroad until it has been paid and
then it is an absolutely complete record
of the transaction to its conclusion and
is ready for file with the voucher de-
partment the object of paying by
voucher instead of by check and voucher
combined is obvious it saves a great
deal of time and the voucher is sure to
be returned duly receipted

   so rast and complicated are the trans-
actions of the treasurers office and so
essential is it that every transaction must
be absolutely complete that effort toward
attaining these ends by the simplest
means and with the expenditure of the
least time is continually being made
this voucher-payment system is coming
into general use throughout the country

paying the bills

   a large portion of the money disbursed
through these vouchers is for the regular
running expenses and maintenance of
the road which in the ordinary course
of events are paid out of its earnings
the current supplies that a railroad
needs each month run into millions the
maintenance of property according to
kirkmans  science of railways is
 per cent of all other operating ex-
penses the locomotives alone repre-
sent an investment of nearly -
 the passenger-cars nearly half that
amount and the freight-cars three times
that sum

   even the battered work-cars total up
over  half a billion dollars
is invested in ties alone and nearly a
billion and a quarter in rails every
item of roadbed right of way and roll-
ing stock has to be kept in thorough re-
pair it all wears out and has to be
renewed sooner or later

   the locomotive repair bills alone are
a big item the union pacific had 
engines last year on all its lines during
the twelvemonth ending june  
it cost to keep them in running order
 which is rather below
than above the average expenditure per
engine the coal that these engines con-
sumed cost  but they
helped earn a revenue by hauling freight
and passengers that amounted to about



the railroad mans magazine

  as an evidence of ownership every
stockholder receives what is called a
stock-certificate this document certi-
fies that he is the owner of so many
shares of such and such a kind of stock
these certificates are inscribed with the
name of the owner his name and ad-
dress are entered in the stock-record
books where every change in ownership
is also set down

  whenever a certificate is transferred
the old one is taken up and canceled
and a new one issued under ordinary
circumstances on a road like the new
york central whose stock is held largely
as a permanent investment the new cer-
tificates average between fifty and one
hundred a day although around june 
and december  the number increases
to nearly a thousand daily on roads
whose stock is very actively traded in
on the exchanges the number of certifi-
cates issued daily is far greater

  when stock dividends are payable
checks have to be sent to the stock-
holders of record on the date on which
the books close this also is a huge
task involving in some companies like
the pennsylvania for instance the ma-
king out signing and mailing of between
forty and fifty thousand checks

transferring stock

  every certificate that comes in for
transfer has to be carefully scrutinized
while forged or spurious certificates are
rare they are not unknown and must be
guarded against the same is true in
regard to the payment of bonds at their
maturity or retirement

  when the interest on a bond falls due
the claim for the money is made by the
presentation of a coupon this is a bit
of paper about twice the size of a post-
age - stamp the number of these at-
tached to each bond corresponds with
the total number of interest- payments
between the issue of the bond and its
maturity

  on each interest date one of these is
detached and presented at the treasurers
office after being verified and checked
off it is paid either by currency or by
check

  on the days when interest is due a
line of bank-runners rush up to the

cashiers window and toss in bundles of
coupons worth perhaps  or
more ticketed with the name of their
owners they hurry on without an in-
stants delay to return for their checks
after the coupons have been counted

  the actual currency and checks re-
ceived are handled in the cashiers de-
partment the checks that are sent out
are issued from that department the
cashier of a railroad company generally
speaking corresponds to the receiving-
teller of a bank he is at one end of a
long room and so definite and exacting
are his duties that he knows less about
what is going on at the other end than
any one else in the office

spending three millions a month

  the paymasters department on a
road like the central has the disbursing
of about  a month in cash
for wages of employees there are two
men who do nothing else and they have
a corps of assistants in new york
state wages of railroad employees have
to be paid in cash every two weeks the
treasurers office receives from the ac-
counting department every week a list
of the payments to be made and the gross
amount to be disbursed each day

  the necessary arrangements are made
before the pay-cars start out so that so
many hundreds of thousands of dollars
may be turned over to each paymaster-
at certain cities along the line each day
the money is not put in envelopes for
the employees but is counted out to each
one of them as he passes through the
pay-car

  the average amount that the pay-car
starts out with on its daily trip is -
 and it is out on the line every day
the railroads whose eastern terminals
or docks are along the water-front of
new york generally take about two days
every fortnight to pay off their marine
and dock forces

  the general office force of the treas-
urers department has charge of the
books of accounts controlling the opera-
tions of the departments the correspond-
ence and other details that are not
taken care of by the other parts of the
office

  on a large railroad the treasurers
spending a railroads money



office will have perhaps  employees
every one of these is bonded in a greater
or less amount no matter whether or
not lie handles any cash the smallest
bond is not less than  the treas-
urer himself is bonded from 
to  and the bonds of the pay-
masters are about the same

  the other responsible heads of de-
partments chief clerks etc are bonded
from  to  each the
total amount of the bonds of all em-
ployees of the treasurers office usually
runs into the millions on a big line where
vast sums are handled daily

  the salaries usually paid employees
of the treasurers department of a great
railway are generally higher than those
in other departments they are also in
excess of those paid in large banks for
the same class of labor

  the heads of departments receive
from  to  a month an as-
sistant treasurers salary may be any-
where between  and  per
annum paymasters draw from  to
 a month there are a number of
employees whose salaries range from 
to  a month beginners start at
about  a month

to the beginner

  the easiest way to enter the treasurers
department-as well as any other in the
railroad service-is by becoming an ex-
pert stenographer in that case the in-
itial wage is at least  a month and
frequently  a month a stenographer
stands much better chance of quick pro-
motion if he is apt and shows ability
than any other of the minor class of
employees on account of his having un-
usual opportunities to familiarize him-
self with the workings not only of his

own department but with those of all
the others

  the voucher department in the roads
using that system is usually considered
the most important of all and its chief-
is generally next in line for promotion
to the post of assistant treasurer the
cashier in some roads stand next in the
order of promotion to the principal place
below that of the chief executive

  the treasurers department is regarded
as one of the most desirable by many
young men who settle on railroad- work
for their career it does not offer so
many opportunities for advancement as
does the operating department but there 
seems to be a certain prestige about the
closely guarded almost mysterious hand-
ling of great sums of money that make
a place in the treasurers office much
coveted by beginners

  once finnly settled there an em-
ployee is almost certain to stay indefi-
nitely so long as he does his work well
and honestly promotions come slowly
when some one ahead drops out the
line moves up one almost automatically
and the vacancy at the bottom is filled
by a new hand in every long-estab-
lished treasurers office it will be found
that nine-tenths of the employees started
in as boys at the bottom of the ladder

  the callers at the treasurers depart-
ment are not the diversified lot with
which the traffic and operating depart-
ments are familiar as a result the
routine is rarely touched with sprightly
incidents almost without exception
every visitor has some definite errant
that is quickly despatched the nature
of the work performed by this depart-
ment demands the utmost care and con-
centration of attention on the matters in
hand therefore the employees are guard-
ed from interruption as much as possible

captain howells takes charge

hilip could not help feeling
pleased with the turn affairs
had taken as he walked
along the beach and through
the brush toward the eastern
end of the island he thought
over the new situation before the com-
ing of miss harding he had had enough
to occupy his time-fishing cooking and
the difficulties attending both

  something had to happen to keep the
adventure going and something had hap-
pened miss harding had turned up
lust at the edge of boredom and with the
news she brought of the landing of the
sailors there came a dozen lively possi-
bilities

   a man gets used to anything phil-
ip said to the sea in his day-dreamy fash-
ion-he was almost forgetting his errand
 take me for instance i used to dab-
ble with grampa septimuss books and
papers and i used to fish then i was
plunged to the other extreme-work

began in the october railroad man

a lean-to with the gold bars he is startled
wandered from a camp of the shipwrecked
american drummer

well i never did get used to work but
in time perhaps  might have they
do say a man gets used to it but it must
require a lot of patience and practise

   then i was told to get my coffin
ready ive been dying now for over a
month im quite used to it now per-
haps because ive practised dying so hard
ive already been nearly dead by tubercu-
losis drowning and starvation inside of
thirty days i believe i could die to or-
der with hardly an effort-just a little
will power but maybe practise has
served only to harden me

   i wonder if there was ever a man
who practised dying so hard that he got
hardened and didnt die after all thats
an interesting thing to work out while im
fishing

  fie suddenly woke up and laughed

   where was i oh yes i was think-
ing about the changing scenes of life
fate certainly has its compensations
when the victim is just tired of one con-
dition along comes another and so the
old play rolls  to the last curtain and
even the finish is welcome as a change

  he came back by degrees to the pres-

maeajine single copies  cents
treasure of the world

ent condition now miss harding was
on the stage again and the villain
higgs and the supernumeraries the
sailors-who for all he knew might he
the principals before matters were
brought to a close

  i f story-books were so closely related
to what usually happens in life then
there was a likelihood that the sailors
would try to get possession of that treas-
ure if they knew of its existence it was
therefore policy to hide the existence of
it as long as possible

  it was not difficult to reach the eastern
end of the island and find the camp of the
shipwrecked sailors all philip had to
do was to walk east and keep near the
beach or on it in about half an hour
he caught a delicious whiff of cooking
food

   thats pork  sighed philip
 theres no safety in numbers-for the
pigs they must have cornered one or
two

  he presently came upon the camp it
was in a bit of glade beneath a grove of
coconuts philip surveyed the scene be-
fore he made his entrance there was a
good fire blazing in the middle of the
picture and the air was full of the scent
of cooked flesh and cooked something
else which philip could not identify al-
though he confessed to himself that it
had a tempting odor

  around the fire four or five men
sprawled with their caps under their
heads for pillows one man was dan-
gerously near the blaze all at once
philip sands peculiarly constituted brain
flashed- back a few hundred years he
smiled it was just like the pirates bar-
becue and that man so near the fire was
gibbys father presently he would be
awakened by the smell of his own flesh
burning and he would spit in the fire to
show his contempt for the entire proceed-
ing-s

  down on the beach another man-
philip recognized him as the mate how-
ells-was pacing slowly up and down
with his atms folded and his head sunk
save when he lifted his eyes to the hori-
zon as he turned on his promenade phil-
ip felt sorry for the man

  presently one of the men by the fire got
up and carefully placed in the fire one
of the large green globular fruits which

philip had noticed that first day in the
jungle when he had lodged it to his
satisfaction lie poked the embers in an-
other place and presently speared and
brought out a big black ball

  here yare  he hailed bread-
fruit served hot 

  a grunt was all the thanks he got for
his labors as cook

  the men who sprawled aroiind the
camp-fire were gorged with pork roasted
breadfruit and coconut milk it was the
hour of siesta

  the cook presently lay down after
thoughtfully spitting in the fire philip
emerged from the trees and crossed the
glade unnoticed although he all but
stepped over one of the men he made
straight for the mate who was still prom-
enading on the beach

   captain howells  said he

  the disgraced man stopped short and
stared at him he did not recognize
philip as the man whom he had insulted
ii the bridge that night in fact his
memory was quite hazy as to the details
of that nights affairs he presumed
however that philip was another sur-
vivor of the wreck-his wreck as he men-
tally termed it

  where did vou come from he in-
quired gruffly

  well said philip smiling as i
was  the island before you arrived the
question might come from me to you
however miss harding has told me your
story and i have come over here to make
a suggestion

   well

   i presume that you are still in com-
mand  

   sakes alive  came from the vicinity
of the fire  look whos here 

  the men woke up suddenly and sur-
veyed philip with no little amazement
not that they recognized him but the
presence of any stranger in their midst
partook of crusoes surprise when he
found the footsteps of friday

  in a moment they were standing around
him curious for information philip told
his story briefly adding  and for a
week ive been trying to catch a pig in-
cidentally would you mind telling me
what there is on this island that i may
safely eat 

  the men stared at him then one of


the railroad mans magazine

them burst out in a loud lazy guffaw and
turned to the fire presently he returned
with a handful of miscellaneous fruits of
the earth he named each of them and
told their merits as edibles again phil-
ip cursed himself for a fool but it was a
relief to know that he would not have
to fish from dawn to dusk to feed the ex-
tra mouth

  the captain in the meantime had re-
sumed his uneasy and indifferent prom-
enade philip however brought him to
a standstill with a word

   as i was saying i have a suggestion
to offer-a proposition to make you as
captain-

  all at once the mate broke out in a
fury it was like the sudden explosion
of a long-smoldering volcano

   dont call me captain  he almost
screamed  dont call me captain
im not captain ive lost my ticket
you know it youre making game of
me stop it or by-ill kill you right
where you stand

  then the man stood still in the sudden
silence that followed his face was pur-
ple with rage which as it cooled down
left him pale and trembling in a mo-
ment he spun around on his heel and
walked up and down with the appearance
of an ashamed broken man

   that might be your misfortune as
much as your fault captain said philip
quietly

  howells stopped again and looked at
sand apparently thunderstruck with sur-
prise he seemed to be at a loss for words
to meet the unexpected remark finally
he blurted out

  thank you adding as an after-
thought   thank you for nothing

   anyway said philip pleasantly
 we are all in the same boat-that is on
the same island there is a lady here
too if any of you are married or have
-sisters you will appreciate the delicacy
of her position

   thats right said the captain
gruffly

  sye exclaimed one of the sailors
a cockney  i wished i was married or
had that for a sister

   stow yer gab  said a second sailor
 let the gentleman have his say fust

   i was going to say said philip im-
perturbably  that as i have employed

the week making myself snug and as the
lady has turned up and accepted my hos-
pitality all of us should agree to make
her as comfortable as possible and i
think the best way to effect that is to give
her all the privacy that her sex and sta-
tion would indicate as her due

   he talks like a schoolmaster said
the cockney sailor

  philip fixed the man with a stern eye 
the others turned upon the englishman
as much as to say

   talk up hes waiting for you

   the cocknej feeling that he was called
upon to make a remark said with a
knowing grin

   e wants to put the chalk on us e
wants to monopolize the fe-male sex

  if i hear another word from you
said philip steadily  ill make such a
monopoly of you that there wont be room
for a chalk mark if you or any one
here offends that lady either by speech
or action i will indicate my position to-
ward the lady more definitely

    oh very well said the impertinent
cockney  lets hear wot your position
is toward the lydy and well tell ye wot
we thinks

  philip flushed but steadily answered

   my position toward the lady is mere-
ly that which yours should be-that of a
man i have given up the little house
i have made to her use and i will berth
forward if you can understand that i
will ask for captain howellss coopera-
tion in keeping her portion of the island
safe from trespass

   i had not meant to discuss this pos-
sible difficulty and what may seem to re-
flect upon the other men is apologized
for it is wholly and solely directed at
this englishman with the nasty tongue
captain howells he added turning
to the down-hearted promenader  you
are still in command and responsible for
the welfare of your crew and the pas-
sengers i ask that you enforce disci-
pline where and when it is required

   e aint captn  said the cockney
scoffingly  e was captn for a night
and never real captn anyway least-
ways there aint no captns ashore

  aint there roared howells sud-
denly waking up look here ive
been mooning long enough and ye know
why  youve had something to eat and
treasure of the world



now youre just about ripe for trouble-
eh well mark my words im not go-
ing to make matters any worsen ive
done im captain dye understand
from this minute until were taken off
and theres going to be discipline as this
gentleman says

  to prove that he meant what he was
saying howells walked right up to the
cockney and struck him between the eyes
the englishman went down on the sand
but was up again in a moment all his
national fighting blood was up he
doubled his fists and charged the cap-
tain they would have engaged had not
the other sailors ome between them

   come on  cried one derisively
 whats the use of fighting aint we
got all we want come on  lets cook
some more pork 

  -	thats an excellent idea said phil-
ip  ill call again and get rations for
the passengers thank you very much
captain howells

  the title was uttered without empha-
sis but it conveyed something to how-
ells who glanced gratefully at philip
grunted something and saluted philip
returned the courtesy and walked away -
as he returned to the golden hut phil-
ip felt uneasy but so far he had
achieved something they would respect
miss harding but-the treasure

  when they learned of that as they
must sooner or later what would be their
attitude

  philip doubted whether the wind-
mooded captain would be able to govern
their lust for gold as howells had said
himself they had plenty to eat and little
to do and they were about ripe for
trouble undisciplined sailors are the
most uncontrollable element in the world

  also- and then philip stopped and
wondered where was higgs he had
not been among the men in the camp his
name had not been mentioned philip
hastened on to the hut his uneasiness
growing with every step when within
fifty yards of the little house of gold
bricks he stopped again he could hear
voices

  he advanced slowly listening intent-
ly at the edge of the brush he paused
and peeped through to the beach miss
harding was there so was higgs

  the agent of the kurve-kut korset

and the no-kut klip was standing be-
fore miss harding his face-his eyes
and his mouth particularly-were moving
with passion and he was talking rapidly
to miss harding

   you must listen to me dear he
was saying  ive been waiting this 
chance for two weeks you ran away 
from me this morning but that was
natural bashfulness i know you care
so you neednt be bashful any more id
make you happy and with a figure like
yours i could make a fortune out of the
new corset

  he uttered another sentence-only
one and then philip stepped out from
the brush miss harding saw him first
a look of glad relief mingled with the
anger of her crimson face

   now she said to higgs pointing
to philip sand  repeat what you said
-what you last said repeat it in the
presence of a gentleman

  mr theodore higgs turned around
slowly his face turned pale at sight
of the man who had once called him an
 unspeakable cad  in no indefinite
manner but he seemed to believe that
defiant bluster would save the situation
and himself

  whats he got to do with it he
protested  this is a matter between
us-as it always is between two people-
 im afraid i stand in loco parentis
here said philip still advancing  or
in the light of an elder brother-or to
simplify matters mr higgs as a man
and a gentleman

   with the last word he brought the flat 
of his hand against higgss left cheek
the corset agent staggered back then
fell down as philip administered a sim-
ilar slap on his right cheek with a
gasp of weak fury higgs scrambled to
his feet and picked up a large stone

  look out cried philip to miss
harding

  the stone whizzed past his own head 
and struck the wall of the hut philip
stood on guard awaiting a possible on-
slaught but just as higgs was about
to throw another stone he seemed to be-
come suddenly petrified

  his eyes were staring past philip
sand and were fixed on the wall of the
hut suddenly he dropped the stone
and walked rapidly into the brush


the railroad mans magazine

   what on earth- exclaimed philip

  then lie saw the cause of higgss
astonishment the stone in striking
the wall had gored into the soft metal
there was a rift of glittering yellow
flashing purely in the sunlight

  no wonder he was astonished
said philip to miss harding to him-
self he added now the murders out
what will they do about it

  miss harding with her face averted
held out her hand to him without a
word and hardly knowing what he was
doing he bent and kissed the delicate
lingers

   i am glad i was of service miss
harding let us forget about it
please

chapter x

the girl or the gold

tvf iss harding had more curios-
ity about the treasure than philip
had it was she who insisted that for
the fun of the thing if for no other
reason they open all the boxes and
ascertain their contents

  in the twilight of that day he led her
to the cave where he had slept the first
nights of his stay on the island in
the box which he had previously opened
they presently discovered a curious dag-
ger with a jeweled hilt its blade was
long and keen

   as i am a lone woman said miss
harding laughingly  i will possess
myself of this-with your permission of
course

  mine said philip stupidly oh
ves he suddenly remembered with a
curious mixture of feeling that he was
the sole possessor of this great wealth

  miss harding stuck the blade into her
belt and posed for a moment in an ad-
venturess manner which emphasized her
sweetness

   watch you dont stick yourself
said philip anxiously

  he pried open the second box and
found its contents similar to those of
the first-images plate silks strings of
precious stones bracelets brooches and
all sorts of apparent loot miss hard-
ing passed an hour trying them on in her
womans way while philip dug into the

other boxes in search of some weapon of
defense

  his search was vain until he came to
the last box-there were about six in all
in thishe found a pair of very ancient
pistols also a curious old sword

  the pistols were utterly useless but
they were in fair condition and had a
particularly venomous look he stowed
them away in his coat pockets the
sword was a handy weapon despite its
age it had apparently seen active
service

   i hope it wont see any more said
philip but i think ph take it for
ornament a man on a desert island
should have a belt full of weapons
dont you think so miss harding

  she with the jeweled dagger stuck
in her waist-belt could not but agree
that it was picturesque if nothing else

  when it was dark he took her back
to the hut and left her there saying
he would go to the camp for rations

   we paid our passage-money you
know and we are entitled to pork at
least said he

   come back quick she said in a low
voice

  philip wondered as he walked to the
camp just what her tone was he could
understand that she was afraid to be
alone in the night yet if he was to
sleep under cover at all he must go to
the cave and the cave was some dis-
tance from the hut

  at the sailors camp he was received
with a silence which was significant
higgs was there the men had been
talking volubly as philip came up but
the moment he entered the circle of
light a hush fell and it seemed to
philip that they regarded him with looks
in which curiosity slyness and awe were
mingled higgs muttered something
but it escaped philip

   is that pork ready  he asked pleas-
antly

  one of the men handed philip a side
of cooked pig wrapped in wild banana
leaves philip took it and turned to go
when the cockney spoke up

   aint you goin to pve for that

  pay said philip why cer-
tainly send in your bill

  as he walked away philip heard the
englishman say to his companions
treasure of the world



   them as as it ought to pye is wot

i	ses es got a monoply in tin but
weve got a monopoly in pork fair is
as fair does is wot-

  philip passed out of hearing he
came upon the captain  the beach
howells was walking up and down like
a madman which philip began to sus-
pect he was at sight of the other
howells gave a great start then he
gave a grunt and walked away but
philip had seen a peculiar light in the
mans eyes-the light that comes when
a desperate man is seized with an idea
that may work out his salvation

  philip returned to the hut miss
harding was standing at the door wait-
ing for him in the clear white moon-
light she was startlinglv beautiful
philip felt something thicken in his
throat he knew what it was but
sternly remembered a resolve which he
had made on the revuelan the night be-
fore the wreck love was not for him
or he for love

   pork chops said he prosaically

  she turned her back on him philip
knelt down and began to hew the chops
apart with the old sword

   do you know miss harding said
he determined to down his heart- do
you know that i have no longer the
same overpowering ambition to slay a
pig

  she did not answer  her back was
to him and she was looking at the
moon perhaps she was thinking ot the
fate of poor miss sharpe

   suppers ready said philip

  after they had eaten philip got up
and held out his hand she had not
spoken a word during the meal

  now i must bid you good night
he said

  she took the hand that was offered
her

   where are you going   she asked
quickly

  to the cave he said you know
where it is if anything should go
wrong

  their hands lingered in the light
clasp all at once a truth-an intuitive
truth-flashed through philips con-
sciousness

  she was his she loved him as he
loved her he had only to reach out

his arms and take her he need only
let that little hand linger a moment
more and the truth must be confessed
between them

  for a moment the air seemed to vi-
brate with the intensity of his souls
struggle love was his if he cared to
take it but his love was the right love
and no man possesses love alone it is
not love unless it is shared by one other

  in this case miss harding was the
one other they might accept what the
gods had given them and be happy in
the circumstances into which the gods
had thrown them yet there were other
circumstances of which miss harding
was unaware his would be the brief
joy hers the long sorrow he was a
doomed man

  it all passed in a moment he drew
his hand from hers and walked away
she may have understood something of
what was passing in his mind she may
have intuitively realized that he loved
her but that there was some obstacle
in the way of happiness for as he went
away she did not say  good night 
even but turned her back and looked
at the moonlit sea presently she en-
tered the hut and laid her head against
the cool gold of the wall

  sand walked to the cave with his
heart and mind in a struggle for the
mastery his mind was made up but
his heart refused to be in accord with
his reasoning

  he lay down in the shelter of the
cave and tried to sleep but sleep was
impossible he knew now that he had
loved miss harding-verina harding-
since the day he had taken her away
from higgs aboard the revuelan
never having admitted his love to him-
self miss hardings supposed death
left love in abeyance he had thought
of her many times in a troubled way-
as if her loss was a personal sorrow to
him-but that was all

  now her coming had touched the
spring of his heart she had come in
the forenoon and before the sun was
quite out of the west the stemmed emo-
tions of two weeks were clamoring for
expression he loved her he wanted
to tell her so he dared not could not
would not and because confession was
impossible love was greater


the railroad mans magazine

  their love was now a matter of mu-
tual knowledge he dared not speak it
she could not utter the initiative word
how hard it would be for them to hold
intercourse-especially under the pecul-
iar circumstances in which they were
thrown together-without crossing the
line

  philip resolutely turned his thoughts
to the more practical questions of the
situation now that the men knew of
the treasure what would they do
what was in the captains mind what
meant the attitude of the sailors silent
save for the significant remark of the
english cockney

   ill hear from them to-morrow
philip concluded

  why not to-night might they not
take advantage of the night to visit the
hut and verify higgss story which
must have seemed a wild tale when told
by him

  yes they might come to-night in
another minute philip was going back
along the beach toward the hut he
would stand guard not over the gold
but the dearer treasure within

  he slowed up as he neared the hut
he did not wish to awaken miss hard-
ing-verina-no miss harding he
did not wish her to think that he was
stealing around the hut either when
he came to the edge of the coconut
grove to the west of the bluff against
which the hut was built he stopped and
surveyed the surroundings

  the moon was clear the sea was
lapping musically along the belt of
white coral-powder sand a light
breeze was whispering at intervals
among the coco fronds otherwise the
scene was perfectly still

  so far all was well philip sat down
under a coconut - palm and decided to
sleep with one eye open he merely
wished to make sure that no one dis-
turbed miss harding

  he slept he was awakened some
time later by a sound the moon was
still shining conditions were exactly
the same he could see no sign of a
human being nevertheless he had
heard an unmistakable sound as of a
branch being thrust aside and snap-
ping as it bent

  he tiptoed forward to the side of the

hut and passed softly into the shadowy
side of it presently he saw the figure
of a man standing under a coconut-palm
with his face turned toward the hut
philip drew the ancient pistol from his
pocket held it up before him and
stepped into the moonlight and toward
the figure

   stand still he said quietly

  the figure did not move the man
must have noticed the weapon in the
others hand without being able to
recognize its useless character when
philip was within a few paces of the
figure he stopped

   stand out and let me see you he
said

  the man stepped defiantly into the
moonlight it was howells

  	i expected better of  you said
philip sand  what did you want at
this time of the night

    i wanted to see whether that higgs
fellow was talking straight or not said
howells sullenly  i see its metal all
right

  out of the corner of his eye philip
caught a glint of metal shimmering in
the moonlight

   yes its metal its gold if that is
what you want to know said philip
 what of it  

   what of it what of it repeated
howells quickly good heavens
man-cant you understand thats a
fortune its big enough to share cant
you see that if i have money i can
snap my fingers at em theyll put
me on trial and ill lose my ticket its
lost already im a ruined man unless
i have money and can snap my fingers
at em-snap my fingers at em 

  he repeated the phrase as if his mind
had become obsessed with the idea of
snapping his fingers at em

   wgll said philip

   look here said howells moving
forward confidentially  its a fortune
for two of us-say three for youll want
the lady to be in on it it wont mean
much if it is divided between the five
others and higgs ill come over to
your side if youll divide with me ill
protect you and the lady

   and stir sides at the outset said
philip coolly  no you wont the
treasure i nothing to me compared with
treasure of the world



the safety of the lady it is your duty
as captain to work to the same end as
for the treasure it can be divided into
nine lots as far as i am concerned  but
for the present it is better left alone
i would suggest captain that you go
back where you came from and do your
duty which is to preserve discipline un-
til we can get this lady out of her present
dilemma will you go

   look here said the captain after
a pause  ill be frank with you 
need the money and im going to get it
im going to get as much of it as i can
lay hands on

   its my only chance to snap my fin-
gers at em i cant afford lo divide
it among nine if you wont take me
in-ill-ill have to lay some other
plan

 meaning said philip  that you
will turn four fairly decent men into
criminals and lead them against me 
 i didnt go as far as that said the
captain t

   but you will go as far as that if
i dont conspire with you to chcat your
men out of what is likely to be a fair
share and share alike

  there was silence a breeze rustled
overhead in the fronds with a sound like
running water the air became percep-
tibly cooler the dawn was coming

   better go back where you came
from and think it over said philip
with a little waye of the old pistol
 i expect you will call to-morrow any-
way

  howells faced him for a moment
is that your last word he asked

   not necessarily  i suppose you will
talk to-morrow

   yes said the captain turning to
go  ill talk to-morrow

  when he had gone philip turned to
the east the dawn was brightening
rapidly and the moonlight was becom-
ing pale

   i think ill fish until-until she gets
up-and think this over

  he procured his jeweled fishing-line
without disturbing her and went to the
barren rocks he caught no fish for he
was paying no attention to his line he
was hammering out the problem of the
girl or the gold

  the gold meant nothing to him yet

the commercial instinct of philander
was anxious to fight for it verinas
safety meant everything to him truth
to tell his unwillingness to give up the
treasure was - due to the fact that it
meant giving up verinas bedroom to the
hands of vandals

  he knew nothing about her save that
he loved her that her name was verina
harding that she was beautiful and
that she had once been the guest of a
person called merton scragg on a steam-
vacht called the chameleon

  and she knew nothing of him-abso-
lutely nothing and particularly she
did not know that he was a man who
had less than eleven months to live and
that his life was mortgaged anyway to
one merton scragg

  but the present problem was whether
he should turn over the treasure to how-
ells and his gang for the sake of peace
or whether he should take howells on
his side and fight for the gold he
might have chosen the latter course but
he did not trust howells

  the disgraced man was adrift on a
straw he would clutch at anything
else that seemed to offer more stable
assurance of his future welfare he
would trick philip and verina as read-
ily as he had proposed to trick his men
he was fighting for self philip was
fighting for another

   so far as i am concerned they can
have the treasure and welcome philip
told himself  ive had the fun of find-
ing it and building a house with it
the only thing is i hate to have them
tear down that house especially now
that a lady owns it ill ask verina
 mis-ter sand  cried a clear voice
down the beach

  he turned there she was standing
in the doorway in the early sunlight
his heart leaped as it will do in a lover
when he sees his love of a morning but
instantly the shadow came back and he
said to himself

   no

   my name he remarked lightly as
he came trudging through the sand to-
ward her  is eminently apt coupled
with my commendable ambition to kill
a pig you might call me sand-hog

   your other name is philip is it
not   she inquired evenly


the railroad mans magazine

  yes-its philip he said a little
unsteadily  and your other name is
verina isnt it

   yes-verina

   well i have decided to call you
philip she said quite steadily

   i hope the decision was not arrived
at by any loss of sleep he said laugh-
ing

  then he was sorry he had said it she
colored and turned her eyes to the sea

   you have been very good to me
she said  i will be frank  didnt
sleep i heard every sound - every-
thing

  oh-did you he inquired stupid-
ly  then perhaps i need not say any
more i thought somebody might come
and somebody did

   i know i saw you under the tree-
and i was glad

   perhaps verina you can tell me
what i should do should i let them
have the treasure or- he stopped
there was an amazed light in her eyes

  no she said abruptly that is
the one thing  did not understand
even if you were very rich you would
be foolish to yield what is yours keep
it philip fight for it if necessary

  he stood before her confused

   i am afraid you do not understand
my position he began but he was in-
terrupted by a crackling in the brush
 here they come-already he said
 all right miss harding i wont give
up-until i have explained now for
trouble 

  the five sailors came along the beach
at a half-run headed by mr higgs and
captain howells philip shoved a
hand into his right pocket and let it
remain there suggestively while he
awaited the enemy

chapter xi

the treasure of the world

af ss harding stood in the door-
way f tie golden hut philip
stood out on the sand with his face to-
ward the oncoming party and his hand
ostentatiously clutching something in the
right pocket of his coat

   well said he to captain howells
as the leader halted his men about twen-

ty paces from the defender  i suppose
youve come to talk

   thats about the size of it said
howells doggedly  irm a man that
likes to see things negotiated peaceably
that was why i came to confer with
you this morning

  philip smiled the explanation was
obviously meant for the men

   and what conclusion have you come
to granting that i refuse to cheat-

   now dont lets have any ill-feeling
mr sand interrupted howells loudly
and hastily  we want to see fair do
and share and share alike of that treas-
ure aint that so boys he inquired
turning to the men

   thats what we want  came the
chorus but philip was observing closely
and a sly wink between higgs and the
cockney sailor did not escape him

   thats so-with a wink said
philip coolly  well i agree so the
wink was unnecessary mr higgs

  higgs said nothing but scowled at
philip sand from his stronghold of
numbers

   you agreeing then said howells
 there is nothing more to be said except
this we-and were the majority mr
sand-held council this morning and
knowing the ways of sailors and trading
skippers we came to the conclusion that
that treasure aint safe standing up there
in full view of any ship that comes
along-and we certainly hope that a
ship will come along to pick us up

   well  said philip non-committally
 what we propose is this that we
remove the treasure to a safer place and
hide it and there leave it saying nothing
about it to the skipper that picks us up
and coming back for it in a chartered
steamer

   that sounds very practical said
philip  only the treasure cannot be
moved at present

  and why not demanded howells
aggressively

   you will perhaps admit that i have
a prior right over this treasure you
will perhaps not admit that any share
which may come to you is purely in the
nature of a gratuity from me how-
ever i have already stated my willing-
ness to divide the stuff into nine lots
but i have no intention of doing this
treasure of the world



until it suits my convenience or rather
the convenience of the lady to whom i
have temporarily loaned the use of the
treasure as a house to live in

   we can build another house put
in higgs promptly

   i wish to hear nothing from you
mr higgs said philip  in fact
when it comes to the division of the
treasure i think i will divide your share
among decent men what have you to
say captain howells

   i take it upon me to repeat mr
higgss suggestion said the captain
 we will build another house for the
lady

   no thank you said philip  the
lady is very comfortable where she is
and has been tossed about enough
through you she will stay where she is
the reference to the captains failings
was unfortunate but philip was angling
for the captains trump card which was
bound to come out sooner or later it
came out with a burst of temper

   all right mr sand that settles-
your hash said howells coarsely
 theres seven of us and only one and
a half of you if you dont come to our
way of thinking smart and give up that
treasure to them as has the right of
majority then well take steps to take
it from you and maybe then we wont
count you and your lady friend in on the
division keeping it for expenses and
trouble incurred in litigation as you
might say

   that of course was what you had
your mind made up to said philip
 well he added twisting his hand
around in his right coat-pocket  my
mind is made up too this treasure is
mine-do you understand-mine-and
you will hive a share of it only if you
behave yourselves

   in the meantime you are on proba-
tion and my orders are that you get back
where you came from and spend your
days in hunting pigs and cooking them
also i would suggest that you try for
fish there are some fine ones off that
pile of rocks now go

  he accompanied the last peremptory
order with another suggestive movement
of his concealed right hand the cap-
tain understood and it was clear to
philip that he had informed the others

of the existence of a pistol philip
blessed the light that had been too dim
for the captain to have seen the nature
of the old weapon

   very well said howells after a
pause  we will give you from now
until to-morrow morning to decide what
it is going to be if you are not out of
that hut by then we will take it that
you mean fight and you can abide by
the consequences

   i agree-to that said philip  until
to-morrow morning at this time captain
howells good morning  

  the men turned to go at a signal from
howells philip called after them

   and by the way until to-morrow
morning any man who comes within two
hundred yards of this spot will be
shot 

  howells half turned he heard but
made no reply philip watched the man
and his little band of underlings out of
sight then turned to miss harding

   i managed that scene very well
dont you think he said with mock
modesty

   yes she said absently  oh
what are we to do 

   i dont know said philip candidly
we are in a tight place verina

   what would you do philip if i were
not here for i know-

  now i will explain he said if
you were not here i would let them
have the treasure and give them a bless-
ing with it

  again she looked at him in a non-com-
prehending manner

   then give it to them she said in
a disappointed way  only- you see
i- my father is very rich mr sand
and my safety means more to him than
a ninth share of a treasure which might
otherwise cost my life but with you it
is-it may be different-

   yes said philip  it is very dif-
ferent i am very poor-poor in ways
that you do not know i have no money
and-

   what is it mr sand-philip
dont you think it would be better if
you told me i know there is some-
thing

   i think it would be better he said
slowly if i were a strong man and
had all life before me this treasure would
g

the railroad mans magazine

mean everything to me-at least it
would mean much and the rest would be
easy i dont mean that being rich
would give me everything my heart de-
sired but if the treasure were worth any-
thing to me then nothing elss would be
in vain

   im afraid this is a riddle she said
 i am afraid it is-to you said
philip  but i somehow dislike telling
you the truth    but i will
   you see miss harding-i am
not in very good health in fact-
he was looking straight at her he
saw her start and become very agitated
her eyes sought his then roamed over
his sun-tanned face and square shoulders

 you she almost whispered
 why it is-absurd  

 there is an absurd side to it even
to me he said  but if an expert in
diagnosis knows his business my life-
dont she cried dont say it
it is a lie-it isnt true 

   i am afraid it is true said philip
 and even if it isnt i-i have so
ordered my life that-i have ordered it
to fit the seeming fact

  he stopped he could see that she
was laboring under a grievous hurt
he feared to be a witness of her agita-
tion it meant so much he could not
fail to recognize openly what it meant
if he continued to witness it he turned
away for a little while by and by he
heard her say

  what is it-philip

  he told her in one word

   oh   she said in a dreary kind of
way

  his back was still toward her there
was silence finally she said

   mr sand you need not turn your
back on me like that look at me

  he slowly turned around and looked
she was standing erect with her hands
clasped before her and her eyes were
brimming with unsuppressed tears philip
was shaken from head to foot he came
forward and held out his hand she
took it holding it far out from her

   i just want to say something she
said smiling through her tears  you
are the bravest man i have ever met-
morally and-and physically too be-
rause you are not strong i just wanted
you to know that-what i think of you

and-and this we understand one an-
other i think-dont we philip

   yes verina i think we do but
dont let us speak about it i am
afraid- he stopped a moment- i
am afraid i am not as strong or as brave
as you think

  he held her hand firmly for a moment
then resolutely dropped it presently he
got his string of pearls with the hook on
it and said 

   come and see me catch fish we
have all day to think and talk about
what it is best to do

  she went with him for hours they
sat in silence more or less she was
puzzling over something which he had
said if he had no money then how
was it that he was able to charter such a
yacht as she knew the chameleon to be

  as if in answer to her thought he
said 

   how strange a thing fate is i
chartered the yacht chameleon with the
idea of hunting for this very treasure
upon which i stumbled

  if the treasure was of no use to you
why did you propose to hunt for it  she
asked

   i wanted to enjoy life said he sim-
ply  and if there is anything of the boy
in you-and i think the boy spirit is in
every living thing more or less-you
will understand why treasure-hunting ap-
pealed to a man who-

  yes i see she said quickly but
the treasure would enable you to do so
much more in the way of traveling and
enjoying life-that is taking it for
granted that is what you want and that
you are-not rich

   i have about five thousand dollars
said he frankly  and then the yacht is
mine for a year if the treasure had
failed i should have turned the chame-
leon into a filibuster or a coconut-trader
or something

  she was silent she understood now
toward dusk they returned from the
fishing while he built the fire she
prepared the-catch for a meal he had
decided not to risk his life in the camp
of the enemy and until matters were
settled they could forego pork

   that by the way is a consideration
in favor of yielding to them he said
 we may have to return to a fish diet if
treasure of the world

-

we dont unless i should achieve my am-
bition

  just as they were eating supper a
whistle came from the beach to the east-
ward philip jumped to his feet a
man stood near the pile of rocks in his
right hand he carried and waved a stick
with a white rag tied to it

  a flag of truce  philip chuckled
thinking of the harmless bit of old iron
which necessitated this precaution in ad-
vance

  he himself went out to meet the man
one of the sailors the fellow handed
him a folded paper which bore  the
outside the imprint of the  kurve-kut
korset  and the name and address of
mr theodore higgs

  the message was written on the inside
of the paper which was a flattened-our
envelope philip read it aloud in a
jocular tone so that verina could hear

                    caicos island

                    august th -

   mr sand caicos island

    dear sir-this letter is delivered
  by our mr svenson

  you are our mr svenson said
philip to the sailor

   ay tank so i ban call axel sven-
son sir

  philip proceeded with the letter
which was obviously the work of the
accomplished agent of the kurve-kut
korset and the no-kut klip

     without any desire to appear dis-
  courteous our mr svenson is author-
  ized to confirm the following

     that if you will agree to
  give up the treasure peaceably and
  without resort to firearms we will
  agree to share and share alike you
  and the lady being entitled to a ninth
  part of the treasure each when the said
  treasure is valued and converted into
  money

      that if you do not agree to
  this to-morrow morning we will take

-	possession of the treasure and eject the
  present occupants of the house of
  which the treasure is built

   he got mixed that time laughed
philip turning to verina he continued
from the note

     furthermore we know that you

to be c

     r r

  have  ammunition for the revolver
  which you carry and the cartridges in
  it wont go off because they got wet
  coming ashore

   very well mr svenson tell mr
higgs that his letter is so succinct and
comprehensive and his thoughts so deli-
cately expressed that i found it un-
necessary to subject you to any cross-
examination

  axel svenson scratched his head and
was still scratching it as he disappeared
into the brush

   well said philip  it is quite funny
but now i think it is time we came to a
serious consideration of this-ultimatum
what are we going to do

   philip said verina suddenly
grave  i have been thinking i dont
want any of the horrid stuff for myself
so it is just you if you dont need it
-i mean want it then let the old thing
go

   verina said he  i dont want it
your safety concerns me more than all
the treasure of the world you know
that before you came the pigs were
kicking these ingots and jewels with their
hoofs before you came i was fishing
for something to eat with a pearl-neck-
lace and a ruby pin now that you are
here i am not going to place any ficti-
tious value upon the husks that the swine
did kick and the fish did eat as against
your life

   and your own  

   mine 

   im sorry she said quickly

  he laughed  dont mention it it
isnt worth mentioning lets give em
the treasure verina and-let me remind
you of something

  he came up to her and put his mouth
close to her ear her hair brushed his
lips and all at once the playful spirit
had borne him into the depths of sweet
pain

   theres more treasure-

  he meant to say that there was more
treasure in the cave to which they would
retreat but his tongue stuck all at
once he was only conscious of the near-
ness of her face and to make matters
worse she divined the cause of his
stopped utterance she suddenly turned
and slipped her arms around his neck

christmas on a flooded
t rack

by clara morris

rphe true story series there are few situations in life
a from which some comfort cannot be derived two full houses and
many things of christmas cheer were waiting for miss morris but
the flood was unrelenting only one consolation remained but the actress
made the best of it she gathered what comforts she could about her and-
she did not act

when the distinguished actress found herself far from the applauding
crowds that paid to see her she clothed herself in philosophy
and a pink wrapper and had a merry christmas

true story number thirty-nine

 hristmas eve and the
 rain was falling the per-
 formance was over and
 as we were to travel the
 rest of the night i hur-
 ried back to my private car
 two telegrams awaited me one said

   a box and several parcels from the
 east are awaiting you at fresno

 presents and letters from home i
 thought and all the woman in me re-
 joiced the other telegram said

   your houses are sold out for both
 performances to-morrow

 all the actress in me was glad

 i awakened twice during the night
 both times we were standing still and

both times i remarked how very quiet
the station was and that the rain was
falling when after a greco - roman
struggle with darkness day dawned the
rain was still falling and the train was
just moving  and to my surprise it was
going backward

  even as i rang for my first coffee we
came to a standstill my waiter told me
that a bridge had been washed away and
they were backing to strike another
branch road and that we were exactly
on the same spur where our car had been
standing for two days past

   oh no that cant be andrew for
there was a good-sized tree in front of
my window and there was a fence

   well lady the hood has carried
away the tree and the fences are all un-

christmas on a flooded track



der water and the river has overflowed
everywhere

  i started for the platform and as i
went i muttered  the wind blew and
the rain fell but my black cook eag-
erly interrupted me with no miss
clah de wind didnt blow de water
carried away detree and de bridge too

  i stood and looked with amaze-
ment nothing but water the
rain did not fall in lines either
straight or slanting literally
it came down in sheets no
earth-no sky-j ust water
water and an ark-i mean a
car

  the engineer came splashing
to us in answer to my question
as to the cause of our halt i
learned that the water had
drowned the engine and that we
were helpless the man was not
at the foot of his class in profan-
ity for in telling this be
 cussed with perfect impartial-
ity the engine the road the pres-
ident the flood various parts of
his own body introducing little
blasphemous trills of great orig-
inality

  finally he growled in a lower
tone  i wouldnt care so much
if it wasnt for mamie and the
kid theyve been countin for
more than a month on my eatin
christmas dinner with em and
now theyll have to sit down at
table alone with a blankety-
blank big turkey and do nothin
but sniffle and worry instead of
havin fun

  my shock merged into pity for
mamie and the kid

  then i had a short damp in-
terview with my manager in
which i learned something of
the wonderful elasticity of the human
countenance-when it is drawn down-
ward poor man how i sympathized
with him for did we not both long for
the receipts of the  two houses that were
sold out  

  and still the rain fell and the flood
rose and the train moved not - hence
more long faces

  i began to understand that my christ-
mas was to lie passed here in this awful

loneliness of water well - all right
i would make the best of it-which i
proceeded to do

  i had the two big lamps lit in my
stateroom i read the lesson and the
prayers for the day i pinned on my
pink flannel wrapper the jewel my hus-
band had presented me

joy enough for
me  

                       what a jewel
flannel
wrapper m a is
que voulez-vous
it was christ-
mas in a car
and the car in a
flood i tied about
my little dogs
neck her new rib-
bon and bell i
had a hot-water
bag at my slip-
pered feet aiid a pile of pillows placed
at my head then i cuddled my morsel
of a dog close to my side and opened
balzacs  cousine bette and the dog
eating bonbons and i drinking coffee i
passed christmas day without the sight
of a wreath or a tree the scent of roast
turkey or taste of plum pudding but
-allah is great and mohammed is his
prophet i had not acted and that was
joy enough for me
straining old eagle-eyes nerves

strong men get pretty badly shaken up by accidents and the
antics of irresponsible fools

it gives a fellow a queer feeling to

 a run into a man said a locomotive
fireman  last summer we were coming
clown past barneveld on the rome water-
town and ogdensburg line of the new
york central with a clear block before us

   we were going at about forty miles an
hour i should say when all at once  saw
one of the milk-station men on a bicycle
shoot out in front of the engine i ducked
for i felt sure we were going to strike
him and when an engine hits anything its
just as well to get down out of the way of
flying splinters glass and whatever you
hit but nothing happened i bet the
pilot didnt miss him by two feet

   it is curious how people will get right
in front of a train when it is coming down
upon them lickety-bang we were ring-
ing our bell and had blown our whistle
but this fellow thought he could get across
all right and as it happened he did you
may be sure though that he was limp and
shaky when he realized what a close call
he had

   as i say it makes a fellow feel queer
to kill a man some years ago we killed
one at richfield junction i dont want
to remember the details we killed another
near sherburne i was on the delaware
lackawanna and western then and every
railroad man on that division knew that
this particular fellow was going to get

killed some clay he was a habitual drunk-
ard and every day that we came along he
would be driving home and cross the track
in front of us

   when he had crossed just in front of
the engine lie would turn around and
laugh at us it was hard on our nerves
you may be sure for we knew that some
day he would surely get it

   well one day he did get it he mis-
calculated the distance and speed and our
engine flung him a hundred feet the
company didnt have to settle for every
man  the line knew of his idiotic actions

   but it is awful to kill a man engi-
neers lay off for months to recover their
lost nerve after they have run over some
one sometimes they never fully recover and
might just as well give up their jobs for
they will do more damage to the company
in the way of putting brakes out of busi-
ness and smashing cars than they can earn

  when an engineer has once lost his
nerve every little thing scares him and he
slams  the emergency brakes at every
shadow they shake up passengers awful-
ly and are likely to injure them

   the engineer with shattered nerves is
usually put on a slow freight or  a
switching-engine sometimes in this way
they gradually get back to their normal
condition and are put on to passenger-trains
again

railroad operated by horses

one of the smallest railroads in opera-
tion is the fulton and oswego falls
in new york it is operated by horses
its length is one mile

  its stock is valued at  it is mort-
gaged for 

  last year its gross earnings were 
operating expenses  deficit exclusive

of taxes and fixed charges  number of
employees including officials  aggregate
salaries and wages 

  the line extends from fulton to oswego
falls and its only new feature in years is
a new whisk-broom hanging in the single
car that is operated presumably for the
convenience of passengers
 not always to the swift

telling of a race that was run with-
out cause and won without glory

he gave the signal the prescribed four
blasts but before completing the final
shrill note he eased up on the cord a bit
and the screech became a tone lower
the result was comically like a signal-
whistle of the village lad to his sweet-
heart that was jims way of saying-
the same thing that barry has said

  grr-rr-rrum in m m-swirr-rrr-rr  they
had dashed over washington street neck
and neck in a cloud of dust only ex-
perts like kathleen and timmie would
have noted that jim had won the twenty-
mile brush by the length of his pilot

  the great divide line was on the
north so jim whizzed by within a few
feet of them his left hand on the  air
his right forearm resting on the sill of
the window-cab he swaved easily in his
seat as the big engine and its attend-
ant coaches rocked past amid swirl and
clatter

  jims blond head never turned nor did
his glance waver from the shining rib-
bons of steel but he saw them his



        acing again arent they
            timmie  

                yes and jims ahead
              ill bet 

             kathleen donovan
daughter of widow dono-
van who runs the railroad-mens board-
ing-house at antioch andlame timmie
cassidy stood together on washington
street near by separated by a scant
sixty feet run the chicago and antioch
-better known as  aunty -and the
chicago great divide

  far down the tracks from each swiftly
rushing train came the long single blast
of the station whistle on its heels
echoed the crossing-signal of barry fox
of the aunty- too-oo-oot too-oo-ooi
toot-toot two long and two short and
 hen after an appreciable pause a single
sharp toot that one was for kathleen
donovans ears alone and meant-she
knew what

  jim mcguire engineer on the great
divide train blew for the crossing also


the railroad mans magazine

right hand came up in the scmimilitary
salute of the railroad man timmie re-
sponded by yelling at the top of his
voice and waving his crutch timmies
dog spot-a big curly black fellow
with an irregular white patch on his side
-gamboled and barked

  as for kathleen she smiled non-com-
mittally before jims engine had shut
off the view she had seen barry fox
raise his hand in salute too still smiling
she turned and went into the house

   aunty  and the great divide have
the same terminal in chicago their trains
coming and going on neighboring tracks
outside the city they diverge  aunty 
swinging to the south and the divide to
the north

  at the widest point to this divergence
it is thirty miles from rail to rail as the
crow flies from there however they
gradually edge back and at tiverton
they come together again tiverton
owendale buckley antioch-the sta-
tions are scarcely a block apart in all
of those places and the tracks lie side by
side for the whole twenty miles

  the passenger-trains which leave chi-
cago at twelve oclock noon on the rival
roads are due at antioch at five oclock
that same afternoon antioch is the first
division-point one hundred and thirty
miles from the city the running-time
between tiverton and antioch is identi-
cal so of course they race

  racing is strictly against the rules of
both roads orders condemning it are
issued at least one each year from head-
quarters in theory everybody frowns
upon it in practise everybody secretly
approves of it the traih-crews as they
take the curves on the inside wheels in
a mad endeavor to beat that thunderbolt
on the other track will explain sturdily

   we aint racin we dont care any-
thing about them but we got our own
time to make aint we  and of course
that is unanswerable

  but conductor and brakemen hustle off
passengers and the baggageman tosses
out baggage as though it burns his fin-
gers the fireman hangs half-way out
the cab-window to catch the  go-ahead 
signal the instant its made that is the
way they act between tiverton and
antioch

  even a division superintendent has

been known to look at his watch twelve
times in the twenty miles even though
he studiously avoided looking at the train
at his elbow his handing the engineer
a cigar at antioch had nothing to do of
course with their beating the other fel-
low two train-lengths to washington
street

  widow donovans boarding-house is
so close to the tracks that it shakes and
rattles to the hourly thunder of passing
trains with ambitious firemen and griz-
zled engineers talking shop about her
table day after day she knows more rail-
roading than a roadmaster she was
peeling potatoes for supper when her
daughter entered

  racin again were they she que-
ried as kathleen laid down the brown-
paper parcel of beefsteak and began pre-
paring a  batch o biscuits  for the
oven

  yes and jim mcguire won

    theyll race themselves out of a job
that pair frowned the widow  dan
mcgann says tis a touch of high-life to
ride after thim he says the coaches do
be rockin like a sea-goin tug if they
ever do pile up he says the whole tiling
cn be sold for toothpicks and horseshoe
nails

   my my and dan mcgann himself
such a slowpoke didnt he get thirty
days for scaring the new general manager
half to death with nine-ninety-four
dan mcgann indeed 

  mrs donovan made  reply to the
indignant query instead she shoved
her steel-rimmed glasses high on her
forehead with the knuckle of her fore-
finger and regarded her daughter fixedly

    kathleen she said at last  all this
racin and whistlin is on your account
why dont you marry either jim mc-
guire or barry fox and have done wid
it sure theyre both dead in earnest
and dyin for a chance to talk serious
to you

  any normal-minded man would agree
that marriage would be a fascinating
question to discuss with miss kathleen
she had the beautiful gray eyes of her
race and her rippling hair was the color
of the horse-chestnut newly released
from its husk
not always to the swift



 two or three
freckles perched
themselves near
the end of a pert
little nose her red
lips had the upward
quirk at the corners
which marks an op-
timistic nature and
a clear conscience

she had bared her
plump white arms
nearly to the shoul-
ders the elbows
where they say an

ill	- natured person
is betrayed by acute
angles were as
dimpled as a babys
cheek

  sure smiled
kathleen as she
gave the dough a
final pat prepara-
tory to cutting it
up  neither has
asked me and
its three years to
leap year

   if youd give
one or the other a chance they would
retorted her mother more mixed  her
pronouns than her reasoning

   theyre both nice boys and see how
bad one would feel if i -married the
other

   see how bad they both feel now
sure they sit and glare across the table
scarce eatin a mouthful they race like
wild min three times a week till im
afraid a train will come bouncin off the
track and right through me house you
should stop this shilly-shallyin and
marry one of them

  kathleen turned about and wagged a
floury finger impressively mother
she said in a deep and measured voice
 i will marry one of them before-be-
fore twenty years from to-day

  she laughed so roguishly at the at-
tentive face that her mother had turned
upon her that mrs donovan smiled in
spite of herself then the widow said 
 aw go  wid you   and attacked the
potatoes with renewed vigor

  meanwhile timmie cassidy and the
faithful spot waited for the coming of

jim mcguire for
jim was timmies
hero

  sometimes barry
fox tossed timmie
a dime on pay-day
but jim was more
free with his
money and be-
sides every other
evening when the
engine was in the
roundhouse the lit-
tle cripple was
hoisted to the engi-
neers shoulder for
a ride to his own
door

  it was only a
step to be sure
he lived next to
donovans and he
never went farther
than the tracks to
wait for jim but
an hours rile in
the finest automo-
bile in antioch
could not have
made him happier
than the brief journey on jims shoul-
der

  really it was quite an adventure
spot carried timmies crutch in his teeth
and walked ahead of them with great
dignity timmie needed both his hands
you see to cling to his steed one thin
little arm went round jims neck the
other clutched his head then when he
had placed jims cap much too big for
him  his own head timmie would
order briefly  buck  

  and how he did buck it took con-
siderable horsemanship to maintain his
place while jim pitched and kicked and
snorted to say nothing of tickling a
fellow in the ribs occasionally which
surely no self-respecting saddler ever did
before

-those rides were bright spots in the
life of timmie who couldnt play ball
with the other boys  account of his
twisted limb they made jim chief
among timmies heroes

   not that lie didnt have other friends
though there was kathleen who wgs
always petting him  and mrs donovan

why dont you marry either jim mcguire
or barry fox  


the railroad mans magazine

who had a way of inquiring gruffly if he
were hungry and then stuffing him with
choice bits from the boarders table

  and spot why he couldnt get
along without spot the dog always
listened with grave comprehension while
timmie detailed at length what he in-
tended to do when the doctors fixed his
leg so he could run and skate like other
boys harnessed to a little red cart
spot drew him about for hours at a time
and always slept at timmies feet at
night

  this evening timmies steed was
strangely docile the
jouncing and tickling
that usually left him
helpless with laugh-
ter were missing al-
most in silence jim
swung the crippled
lad to his shoulder
and after a few half-
hearted bucks set
him down on his own
step  and timmie
with dark moods of
his own to live
through understood
that something was
wrong and asked no
questions

iii

  a good deal was
wrong j im was
ashamed and furious-
ly angry-ashamed of
himself and angry
with barry fox

  the engineer of the  aunty smart-
ing under the defeat which kathleen had
seen administered waited outside the
divide roundhouse  purpose to quar-
rel and they had quarreled no blows
were struck because barry big as ho
was thought it best to speak   light-
ing  words but he had badgered jim
into a dispute over kathleen

  that was why jim was ashamed  that
the girl he loved should become even
though not named the subject-of bicker-
ing between them

  he felt that lie was as much to blame
as fox he should have walked away
and refused to quarrel thus he  would

have avoided the proposal fox had made
namely that they race the three  out 
trips next week tiverton to antioch the
loser of two heats to change boarding-
place and relinquish all claim to kath-
leen

  not that jim feared the outcome of
the race but to bargain for dainty
bright-eved kathleen seemed ignoble

    its a wonder he didnt want to shake
dice or play seven-up for her growled
jim to himself and i was so mad
id been fool enough to take him up
racin racin for as nice a little girl
as-as ever wore tan
shoes timmie cassi-
dys spot has more
decency than that
barry did not come
home to supper he
was taking the edge
off his feelings at the
corner saloon jim
ate about as much as
the canary said
 yes  and  no 
three times and
slipped out of doors
without a look at
kathleen wr her eat
mrs donovan put-
ting two and two to-
gether turned re-
proachful eyes on
her daughter and
grumbled all the eve-
ning about  racin
it was saturday
night and by tacit
consent the rivals
kept out of each
others way over sunday they avoided
opportunities to race going into chicago
 the seven oclock trains monday morn-
ing but each spent an extra two hours
at the roundhouse in the city monday
afternoon preparing for the first race
tuesday

  for now that the bargain was made
though his cheeks burned when lie
thought of it jim did not dream of
repudiating it that would not be the
way of a man with red blood in his veins
he would make the race that was the
thing to do and if fox beat him-
well hed have to go some thats all

  mcguire did not underestimate his
not always to the swift



rival for fox was a good engineer he
was a dark curly haired fellow with
massive shoulders and lie understood his
engine as a good engineer should

  but mcguire blond and boyish was
also in the idiom of the road  some
engineer he pulled levers and tapped
valves with the loving delicacy of a mas-
ter drawing harmony from a violin but
his locomotive ran like a scared deer

  the races were to be  luck o the
road that meant an even start out of
tiverton and take your chances from
there to antioch and luck in so short
a series would play a large part in the
filial result

  tuesday morning there was more care-
ful grooming in two smoky noisv chicago
roundhouses later as each engine rat-
tled through the wilderness of tracks and
jolted over scores of switchpoints to the
station its driver smiled confidently

  they pulled out of chicago on the
minute and fox whistled for tiverton a
trifle under four and a half hours later
on the second then he waited ten
minutes tinkering with a wedge and
making ingenious excuses to his con-
ductor before the divide train rolled in
jim had been compelled to pick up four
extra coaches down the line they were
bound for the repair-shops at antioch

  jim made a game fight but the extra
weight of the limping coaches was too
much for him barry beat him to wash-
ington street although he almost ran
the wheels from under his cripples and
tore into antioch with three hot boxes
blazing

iv

  that night at supper fox was
flushed and in boisterous spirits tim-
mie had a famous ride to judge by his
squeals of laughter and mcguire came
in quiet but cheerful kathleen looked
at both of them queerly mrs donovan
who had noted the hot boxes shook her
head doubtfully

  thursdays race was a hollow victory
for jim barry could take small com-
fort from the fact that a show-troupe had
held him at buckley he would have
been beaten without that

came saturday and the final heat

  each pulled into tiverton about five
minutes late which was well the regu-

lar schedule was likely to be too long
that day

  as the locomotives came to a panting
halt  each side of the old union sta-
tion-it has since been torn down-the
engineers were  the ground simulta-
neously they oiled round tightened a
nut here felt a bearing there-girded the
loins of steel for the home-stretch

  the baggage was unloaded the pas-
sengers streamed off and  joe barry
of the divide and wish sullivan of the
 aunty came out of the depot with
their orders chatting amiably together
each handed a yellow slip to his engi-
neer each looked at his watch and
snapped it shut their warning call of
all-  abo-oo-oard   blended each
right hand shot up in signal they were
off

  the passengers settled themselves in
their seats with pleased animation
there was going to be a race all right
ciuhj cnth chui said the engines at
first then as they gathered speed c-
chuh chuh-chith chuh-chuh

  the engineers  opened them up  a
little more and the firemen in the rival
cabs watched the steam-gage anxiously

  barrys load was a little the lighter
and besides his engine picked it up
more quickly he led during the three-
mile run to owendale conductors and
brakemen were off at that liamlet before
the wheels stopped turning sam hol-
lis baggageman  the divide roared
terrifyingly while the air brakes were still-
whistling and shoved a big sample-trunk
at the agent before that astonished indi-
vidual could bring up a truck to re-
ceive it

  the  aunty  had one passenger to
alight a little old lady now little old
ladies are likely to be dim as to sight and
doubtful and hesitant as to car-steps
rather than see her waste precious sec-
onds wish sullivan picked her up gently
as she stood on the platform walked nim-
bly down the steps and set her down on
the cinders when she had caught her
breath sufficiently to say  well sakes
alive he was waving a smiling good-
by from the rear platform of the receding
train

  the five miles to buckley was up
grade and they thundered along neck
and neck every foot of the way me-


the railroad mans magazine

guire managed to make up the two car-
lengths he had lost but that was all it
was a brief stop at buckley and again
the conductors waved go ahead  at al-
most the same instant

  mcguire had a good fireman and the
safety-valve was popping under a full
head of steam because his machine was
a slow starter the blond engineer needed
every foot he could get he turned on
the sand and drew steadily backward on
the lever

  the big drivers spun round in the
sand shooting sparks like a blacksmiths
forge then they bit into the rails and
the train fairly leaped ahead fox got
no advantage in that start ahead were
twelve straight level miles-and no stop
till antioch 

  away they went the smoke streaming
in tattered billows behind the cinders
drumming on the roofs of the coaches
like hail the two big locomotives
rocked and pitched as though they would
leap from the track

  the firemen sweat streaming from
their faces scattered coal craftily over the
gkwing furnace of the fire-box a shov-
elful too much in any spot might mean
temporary smothering of the fire there
and consequent loss of time and steam
was needed now

  fifty - five sixty-even sixty - five-
miles an hour the flying wheels spurned
the steel pathway and up on the right
side of each huge boiler sat a grim-faced
man still  pounding er on the back in
railroad vernacular-coaxing each ounce
of steam into play each thrust of the
piston into more effective action

  four miles were gone before condition
began to tell mcguires engine han-
dled habitually with consideration began
to creep ahead it had never been racked
as fox in black fits of temper had some-
times racked his by savage stops and
starts now jim was repaid his en-
gine steamed more easily

  five miles and fox had lost a car-
length despite the efforts of himself and
his fireman six miles and he was two
car-lengths in the rear eight miles and
his pilot was lapping the rear platform
of the divide train ten miles and he
had slipped back until he was pounding
along a hundred and fifty yards behind
hopelessly beaten-or so it seemed

  a mile out of antioch mcguire
reached for the whistle-cord he lin-
gered on the long single blast a moment
as he sighted a moving speck alongside
the track a dog-a black dog with a
white patch oil his side timmie cassi-
dys dog of course

  dogs do foolish things sometimes-
even as do their masters spots evil
genius tempted him just then to a foolish
act he looked over his shoulder and
saw the flying train as if challenging
it to a race he leaped into the center of
the track and sped away homeward a
living streak of black and white

  with an imprecation on the playful
spot the divide engineer jerked the cord
viciously sending out a volley of short
shrill toots he knew that unless the
dog gave up this dangerous game he
would be overtaken and cut to pieces
within two hundred yards

  and spot every idea driven out of his
silly head by the urgent alarm felt his
playfulness of a sudden changed to mad
panic there was nothing to do but run
and run and run

  he lowered his tail and spurned the
cinders with prodigious leaps a single
bound sidewise in either direction would
have carried him to safety but he
strove only for washington street-and
timmie

  jim mcguire ground his teeth and
strained his whistle-cord almost to the
breaking-point shutting off was out of
the question of course barry fox was
right at his heels

  the slightest reduction of speed meant
that the  aunty train would nose him
out of the race-and kathleen spot
could be replaced-he would buy timmie
another dog-

  then quite of its own volition a pic-
ture flashed into jims mind timmie
waiting at the crossing for his homeward
ridei the thin little face aglow the thin
little arms uplifted the pitiful twisted
leg dangling and spot carrying the
crutch-spot-timmies dog

  with something between an oath and
a groan he closed the throttle with a
snap turned on the sand and applied the
air bump the train slackened with
a suddenness that almost threw the pas-
sengers from their seats the cars
bucked and jumped the rails squealed
not always to the swift



evilly as the wheels slid along clamped
by the whistling air-valves

  at that precise moment common sense
returned to spots addled brain with
the pilot but a few yards from his tail
he sprang far to
the right and
rolled over and
over d o w n the
steep grade - un-
hurt

  instantly the
blond engineer
threw everything
wide open again
but it was too
late the brief
loss of momen-
tum was fatal

while fox grinned
tri u m p h a ntly
at mcguires fire-
man the aunty
flashed by in a
cloud of dust and
smoke

  by ten oclock
that night mc-
guire had com-
pleted his packing
and was ready to
move he had de- the little cripple
cided to put oft	engineers

the hour of em-
barrassing explanation as long as pos-
sible it was necessary too to frame
up a plausible story against the coming
of that hour there was no real hurry
he would tell mrs donovan sunday
night just before the wagon came for
his trunk

  the donovan house has a veranda
around three sides of it well screened by
wild-cucumber vines when jim came
down to get a breath of air-for the
night was warm-he gravitated by in-
stinct to the side next the railroad his
sigh as he dropped into a rustic chair was
answered by a rustle from the hammock
in the darkest angle of the porch

   good evening he ventured

   good evening mr mcguire came
a low voice in response

  the  mister  stung like a blow it

had always been jim before oh
well if she were going to rub it in- he
arose

   i didnt know there was any one
here he said stiffly showing his feelings

  but her next
words arrested his
footsteps

    so youre go-
ing to leave us  
going to leave
them - how did
she know  he
had told no one-
had not mentioned
the significance of
the race to a soul
had barry asked
her already and
been accepted
they had laughed
undoubtedly over
the luck of the
road that had
beaten him well
let them laugh

    yes he said
shortly

   where to if
you care to tell
to -to mrs
mastersons

   he hadnt real-
ly decided and
that was the first
name that came to
him

tone was frigid
a daughter-a girl

was hoisted on the
shoulder

indeed the
mrs masterson had

about kathleens own age  why are
you going there  with the slightest pos-
sible accent on the  there

    its-its nearer the roundhouse he
stumbled

   yes-half a block thats one rea-
son nellie masterson is another i sup-
pose and you lost the race 

  she was sitting up in the hammock
now into her voice during that last
sentence had crept a new thrilling tone
it drove jim to sit down again

   but when she continued the thrill had
become buried beneath tons of ice

   you raced for me-me jim mc-
guire as though i was the ten-dollar bill
the company gives every month to the
man who saves the most coal you and


the railroad mans magazine

barry fox who gave you the right
jim mcguire

  her voice trembled and broke toward
the last jim writhed in his chair in
remorse and compassion he opened his
mouth to speak and closed it again fu-
tilely it was all true every word of
it what was there to say in defense of
their conduct nothing

   barry foxs fireman told me this
evening she said her voice under con-
trol again  barry boasted over his
 victory what must folks think of me
jim mcguire me so cheap that i must
be raced for by two of my mothers board-
ers  

  he sprang to his feet again clenching
and unclenching his hands  for gods
sake kathleen he implored  dont

feel so bad about it id give my life to
keep sorrow from you i know i was a
fool but i didnt mean to hurt you
she was crying softly now and the
sound wrenched his heart-strings he
dropped on his knees beside the ham-
mock

   kathleen darling he pleaded
apparently the girl took no notice of-
the endearment the first he had ever ut-
tered to her

 you might have found out she said
in a small forlorn voice wh-whether
it was n-necessary to-to race or not
with a little cry of love jim gathered
her into his arms

-	barry fox has been known to express
on occasion his amazement over the fact
that the race is not always to the swift

 frances famous record runs

how the land of the lily has made marvelous strides in railway

                  speed in the past few years

france lias a law against the running
of trains at more than seventy-five
niles an hour in any part of the country
but somehow this has not prevented the
french roads in very recent times from
breaking all previous european records

  heretofore great britain lias been con-
sidered the home of the fastest and safest
railroading but france is rapidly winning
first place in the former respect at least
and this notwithstanding the fact that down
to very recently the french railroads have
been notoriously slow compared with eng-
lish and american roads and that the road-
beds were and still are in a poor con-
dition

  the sudden burst of speed on french
roads has come about through the stub-
bornness of french manufacturers sure
of their home trade they refused to enlarge
their plants or work overtime so as to
supply the  government railroads and the
orleans company with engines and these
patrons immediately transferred their pat-
ronage by ordering locomotives of the at-
lantic type from america

  they had had their eyes on these engines
for a long time envying their speed and
strength a good and fast engine wants a
good and substantial road-bed as well as
other important accompaniments these

trifles the french thought they could over-
look and the result was a disaster which
permanently curtailed the speed ambitions
of two roads the orleans and the midi

  but within a year french roads were
going some the sud express between
bayonne and dax was averaging fifty-
seven miles an hour the sixty-seven miles
between morcoux and bordeaux was tra-
versed in sixty-three minutes and the whole
journey from paris to bayonne was at an
average of fifty miles an hour

  the paris-lille express makes what is
said to be the fastest time for the distance
in the world the hundred-and-twenty-mile
run from paris to arras being accom-
plished in one hundred and seventeen min-
utes or at the average rate of sixty-one
and a half miles an hour

  again the paris-amiens train is the
fastest of its distance in the world making
the eighty-one miles at the rate of sixty-
three and one-fifth miles an hour

  the orleans-tours does its seventy miles
in seventy-two minutes the tours poictiers
cuts away sixty-three miles in sixty-eight
minutes while the poictiers-angouleme
does seventy-one miles in seventy-four min-
utes and the distance between angouleme
and bordeaux eighty-seven miles is covered
in ninety-one minutes
full speed ahead

plans have been prepared for a new

which is owned by the united states steel
corporation the new roundhouse will be
constructed of steel and concrete and will
be almost double the capacity of the pres-

production of the steel corporations
plants in pittsburgh which has resulted in
much heavier tonnage for the union rail-
road it has been necessary to purchase ad-
ditional locomotives the new engines are
much larger than those formerly in use

the chicago and northwestern has
given out the following information
regarding the  new all-steel passenger-
cars which that road recently ordered
from the pullman co and which are now
under construction all of these cars
are fully equipped with non-collapsible
heavily reenforced steel frames with the
most modern safety vestibules westing-
house high speed air-brake equipment and
the latest improved draft gear the floors
are laid with a sanitary composition that
adds strength to the car and deadens the
noise of the train even the frames of
the seats are built of steel and no com-
bustible material enters into any part of
the construction the new dining-cars
will have features that are of direct interest
to the public each car is arranged to seat
thirty-six people which is six more than
the usual standard and special improve-
ments have been effected in the arrange-
ment of the kitchen and pantry which will
insure greater capacity and more prompt
service and at the same time remove all
odors from the kitchen the day coaches
and reclining-chair cars are to be five feet
longer than the largest cars heretofore used
and will in consequence have greater seat-
ing capacity the parlor-cars will be of
the most ample dimensions and the in-
terior fittings and finish will be in accord-
ance with the usual luxurious northwestern
standard special attention has been
given to the sanitary arrangement of all
this equipment and it will all be fitted with
the latest devices for insuring cleanliness
and satisfactory ventilation the chicago
and northwestern will be the first western
road to provide all-steel safety fire-proof
equipment on through passenger-trains

mabel on a mountain

 by cromwell childe

            sometimes it pays to be snowed in even
            if it does happen on your wedding-day

firrrsob taintor cursed at the
fo snow-storm that was settling
kdusv down thicker than ever any
jijgpj man would who had a bride
coming toward him as fast
as steam could carry her
there he was in denver holding down
his job as private secretary to ephraim
babbott president of the denver and
western and she - heaven knew just
where or how-with this snow growing
into a great white torrent

 to-morrow was to have been their
wedding-day at  that morning
mabel was to have taken no  out
of glen wood springs it would have
come into denver at  that night
the next afternoon under a bower of
white roses in her sisters parlor she
was to have become mrs bob

 and now no  had left glenwood
springs reasonably on time the storm
had not held her back materially though
it was slow running even with two en-
gines until up over a very heavy grade
she entered the canon of the grand
river mounting toilsomely toward the
gaunt gray peaks on the west side of
the range

  the little clock over the secretarys
desk had its hands at four there had
been no word from the dispatchers
office for two hours nervously bob
taintor went over to the operator just
outside his door

  the click-click repeated many times

over seemed to bring mabel nearer to
him she had been a telegraph opera-
tor in fact it was only the night before
that she had ceased being one he re-
membered how pretty she looked the first
time he saw her in an office at glenwood
springs and what a little witch she
was with a key it was not so long ago
that he had handled a key himself by
pure luck babbott had happened to run
across him and set him on his feet in
direct line for promotion a hundred
a month now and bob saw visions of
many things

  there was no need to ask maguire
any questions tick-tick a message
came and bob read it in the clicks of
the morse

  manton four passed  con-
  ductor says cannot get much farther

  going to try to make next station

  snowfall increasing

   there wont be a wheel turning
soon said maguire  not a hundred
and fifty miles west of here at any
rate

  restlessly bob went back into his
office it was fortunate perhaps that
president ephraim babbott was in chi-
cago for he would have had a some-
what unfavorable impression of his
young secretary the young man he
had liked so much because of his cool
collected air was cool and collected no
longer
	the railroad mans magazine

   i dont- he began pacing the
floor worriedly no there cant any-
thing happen i dont know though
by godfrey to think of that blessed lit-
tle scamp up there in the cold 

  he took another turn up and down
the room he seized a picture from his
desk and took it over to the window
the thick rush of whirling snow blotted
out all but the very nearest buildings 

  it proved a good guess at seven
oclock that night after countless tele-
phone messages to elsj mabels sister
-who hourly got more and more wor-
ried and who bewailed the white satin
and duchesse lace wedding - gown laid
out on her spare-room bed-the operator
at ivanhoe was heard from

  he told how no  had manfully
pushed through the desolate storm-bound

the yard force saw its burly trainmaster go down into a snow-drift

  the photograph showed the saucy
piquant face of a dainty blond girl that
any man might be proud of winning
bob groaned as he thought of what was
to have been at half past ten that eve-
ning he could seem to see her step-
ping from the train in the denver depot

   busk wires three due there 
this morning snowed up two hundred
feet from station platform called out
maguire poking his head in at the door
no  was the west-bound transconti-
nental express

  looks like my wedding to-morrow
all right all right jim fourll get just
about to ivanhoe andll be doing darned
well at that

bleakness above the timber line and had
finally been prisoned in huge drifts just
at the tunnels mouth

  ivanhoe is a platform and an opera-
tors shanty-only that and nothing else
-two hundred and twenty miles west of
denver so high up in the peaks of the
rockies that forest fires snow slides
and never-ending cold have left only
the grim bare rocks and a series of
wonderful views for the traveler from
glenwood springs under the ihost fa-
vorable of conditions it takes four hours
for a train to climb the grades just
sixty miles

  over the summit of the range toward
denver lies busk the ingenuity of
mabel on a mountain

tain-climbing must come to an end in-
stead of further twisting and more ser-
pentine coils among the rocks they
bored the mountain the busk tunnel
three miles long is the result ft was
at each end of this that a train was
stalled that farthest away with the pret-
ty bride-that-was-to-have-been among its
passengers

  no  had five cars-a baggage-car
a mail -car a smoker and two day-
coaches old - fashioned baker heaters
kept the day - coaches and the smoker
reasonably warm at seven oclock at
night when the drifts on the mountain-
side just at the entrance to the tunnel
finally blocked theway everybody was
still comfortable the well-filled wood-
boxes made it certain that no one would
suffer for a good many hours

	 you know better man said raf-
ferty the trainmaster his mustache
icicle-covered after a tour of the yards
get to ivanhoe you couldnt get
fifty miles from here to-night youre
enough of a railroad man bob to know
when to keep your shirt on no s all
right your little gals o k shes
probly playing bridge whist now with
some o those nifty chicago drummers
rafferty did not lose bob that night
until gray dawn-a dawn far grayer
than usual because of the snow whirling
faster and faster-both sat listening to
the tale of train after train coming into
denver hours and hours late and of
others far away in the mountains snow-
bound beyond all help

  not a single wheel finally was turn-
ing but long before midnight the
private secretary had ticked off two mes-
sages to his sweetheart held tightly on
the mountain-top and received one from
her sloan the ivanhoe operator most
obliging of fellows-who had a girl of
his own and privately thought bob
a prince - had carried the messages
through two hundred yards of blinding
storm to the train and morsed back ma-
bels penciled scrawl

    dont worry but youre horrid if
  you dont isnt it awful but im
  just as comfortable as anything dear-
  est love

  everybody on the train pooled for a
dinner the remnants of the luncheons

   	r r

which some with wise forethought had
brought they made a gay little party
rafferty was right in part of his guess
there were two drummers from chicago
aboard a manufacturer from keno-
sha wisconsin a woman in widows
black a swede farmhand a pair of
prosperous - looking farmers a german
frau with two pig-tailed little girls a
denver business man and a glenwood
springs lawyer spruce in the extreme
were very much in evidence

  the wood - boxes still showed brave
heaps of chunky logs if any one wor-
ried down in his heart he did not let the
others know but simpson conductor
after he had fought his way over the
tender and peered at the mountainous
drifts in front-seen through a swaying
curtain of almost opaque white-had his
thoughts

  to the people on the train to raf-
ferty and a certain ardent young man
in denver the morning brought a real-
ization that no  was in for it the
storm had not stopped let alone get-
ting out to the foot-hills it was impossi-
ble to move trains close to denver

   tied up a heap worse bob than we
were last night said rafferty at nine
 keep your mind easy though bout
the kid jack simpsons a dandy you
can trust him bout this time to-night
you and mell take stock an see what
we can do its no cinch though those
rotaries are goin to have

   youre a good fellow raff said
bob  but-i must get out i must i
tell you i-

  how youre goin to cut in the
trainmaster  go out on a rotary
try it bill get aboard take the
first one but say wait till you get
stuck in a drift fifty miles from nowhere
wherell you be then hey now you
can wire straight to the lady you can
spoon that way a lot course it wont
be up to a parlor with the gas down
a holding one of her little hands oh
ive been there

   shut up   and to its utter demor-
alization the yard force saw its burly
trainmaster go down into a snow-drift
to be well mauled there by the wiry
athletic private secretary until he cried
for mercy and promised to devote all his
skill in rescuing mabel


the railroad mans magazine

  that young lady had had a capital
nights rest mabel was never miss
worry she took what came in her sim-
ple pleased girlish way when she had
been given her place as operator in
glenwood springs it was the most de-
lightful piece of luck she ever knew
when bob proposed she was the most
fortunate girl on earth

  the faithful sloan made his appear-
ance by eight oclock this is the mes-
sage mabel gave him then to tick off to
the private secretary

    youre not to worry a mite bobbie
  have you written that all down mr
  sloan warm as toast lots to eat
  now we zvill have mr station agent
  dont you leave that out awfully nice
  people especially the ivanhoe operator

  blue eyes dont you dare get that
  wrong now be jealous yes you
  can send all that good-by

                                 bobsy

  her little hand reached out for the
pad and pencil that sloan held

   here i cant talk the rest of it

  she wrote a few words rapidly then
folded the sheet over when sloan got
at his key and started sending he found
the words below his own were  and
god bless my boy

  mabel had taken one of the pig-
tailed german girls to  bed  with her
cuddling the plump small body close
in the uncomfortable seats she had
begged the child from its mother and
by the time she had washed and dried
the two youngsters faces in the morn-
ing she was a close family friend when
mrs helmzwitter heard of the balked
wedding plans and had seen his picture
in the locket around mabels neck she
became enthusiastic sympathetic com-
miserating hopeful

  ach lieberchen it vill coom all
right such a be-youtiful yunger man

so fat you vill be von happy mailchen
ach so romantistic es st wie goethe

  mabel raised the brightest proudest
face to her new friend

mabel on a mountain

 witter hugging
 gretchen and hilda
 together in one ca-
 pacious embrace

  a voman vants
 to tink dot off her
 man effry time

   it couid not long
 remain a secret that 
 a near - bride was
 aboard and congratulations commenced
 to shower it was the swede farmhand
 however who first rose to the occasion
 and perceived the proprieties pie mum-
 bled  ay tank congrats awkwardly
 and stolidly shuffled to his seat

   in the bustle about the pretty girl and
 amid the flowery speeches of the two
 chicago drummers the denver business
 man and the glenwood springs lawyer
 nobody noticed that the swede was dig-
 ging down deep into his clumsy bag
 nobody even thought- of him until his
 lanky form edged its way between the
 enthusiastic drummers

    ay vant he began stammeringly
  to gif yo dis sophie she vould say
  gude boy yonnie ay got it for her
 and he laid in her hands a big bright
 breastpin with gaily colored stones

   the brides eyes filled with happy
 tears was the whole world as good as
 this why it wasnt only bob who
 was a dear everybody was that with
 but bob the nicest of all she sprang
 up and reached out both her hands for
 thejewel

    thank you  thank you   she cried

 its just the most
splendid thing i
dont know your
name-only part of
it ill call you by
that its fine yon-
ifie-fine 

  her hands went
into the big paws
of the swede and
held them tight
having made his
speech yon could
only grin happily
clumsily shifting
his feet he stood
there one great
mass of satisfaction

  cheers embar-
rassed him further
the passengers
slapped his shoul-
ders vigorously and
shouted good
man yon youre
all right

   ay tank she like
it said yon beam-
ing after the noise
had subsided but he was not to hold
the center of the stage the denver
business man sprang forward

  shall he beat us boys he yod-
eled no not for me he may tie
us but he cant beat us ill bet this
crowds got sporting blood  get busy
boys  get busy 

  he rummaged in his pockets and
dropped back into his seat in a mo-
ment mabel was completely deserted
every man and woman suddenly became
absorbed in the mysteries of their bags
the denver business man was the first
to emerge he approached mabel with
a courtly bow

   there never was a bride on her wed-
ding-day he said with a laugh  who
colfld see her presents straight this is
a dozen solid silver spoons

  into her lap he tossed a folded slip
of paper it was a check drawn to the
order of  cash

  the woman in widows black leaned
over the seat with a tiny embroidered
handkerchief done up in tissue - paper
and she timidly kissed the little bride
the youngest chicago drummer had

                                    -wrnrt

 i dont know vour tjame-only part of it


the railroad mans magazine

made a flying rush for the baggage-car
he came hack on the jump with a
lavender kimono only thing good
enough ive got with me he told her
 its from stock but ill fix that all
right with the house you may have to
clean it up a little

   im in builders hardware the sec-
ond drummer announced after an un-
successful search through his grip
 nothing tasty among my truck like
crawford theres got but thats easy
to fix he scribbled on a piece of
paper and handed it over

one morris chair for library coining

  p kurtz with j salomon  brothers
  ld wabash avenue chicago

  then the four italians in the smoker
seemed to understand if they knew
any english no one could tell it they
jabbered enthusiastically among them-
selves went back into the smoker and
finally returned with four brilliant head-
kerchiefs-a glory of purple red yel-
low and blue

  from his valise the glenwood springs
attorney presented a book fresh in its
original wrappings the farmers came
up with diffidence they had been con-
sulting together earnestly  this has
caught us at a bad moment they told
mabel  weve nothing in our bags
for a lady

   when you start housekeeping
though said the larger of the two
 every little thing counts

   at any rate thesell save your hus-
band some money and you can spend
that money on fixings for yourself con-
tinued the other

  they lajd before her a safety razor
and a necktie

  mrs helmzwitter produced a knitted
shawl that mabel at once wrapped
about her shoulders after much whis-
pering gretchen and hilda shyly ap-
proached behind each little back was
a hand

the little hands came out and each
held a small dolly mabel grabbed and
took into her arms both girls and dolls
you darling darlings she cried

  a cold blast the slain of a door and
conductor simpson blew in

   me the pierp morgan when it comes
to the eats he announced trust

your uncle jack for the commissariat
beginning to get hungry i guess lunch-
baskets pretty empty and its nearly
breakfast - time boys and girls we
shant starve breakfasts all in shape
dinner and supper provided for too
whats this

  he wormed his way into the group
by this time mabel was happily crying
in chorus every one explained

   ill be swiggered  said conductor
simpson  so shes a bride - or as
good as one-and bob taintors bride at
that say the denver and westerns
got to come in never do for the road
to be left out  this sort of a deal
ladies and gentlemen the president is
not among us a number of the other
high officers are not i am the -ranking
official present

  the denver business man started the
applause

   at the moment we are a bit handi-
capped went on simpson  but well
do the slickest we can he pulled his
knife from his pocket and detached a
little charm from his watch-chain
 with best wishes and he placed it
in her hand  for the mrs bob taintor
that is to be

   and now continued jack simpson
 this is what i started to tell you its
no wayside picnic this not to - day
nor yet to-morrow nor for several days
are we going to get out of these snow-
drifts some folks might go hungry
but no  has always been a cracker-
jack she keeps up her reputation-see

   say i aint joking in the baggage-
car theres a slew  game-chickens and
a mess o bottled beer also-and if
one o you ladies is willing to do a mite
o rustling-theres a bag o flour

  it was then that the woman in widows
black proved herself the most useful
drafting mabel as a helper- to get
you in practise my dear -inside of
twenty minutes she produced over the
baker heater what drummer kurtz
called a most superior article

  drummer crawford plowed through
the snow to sloans shanty with a three-
cornered note from mabel  receiving
which the infatuated operator rashly
handed over all the salt he had and
offered everything in his supply cup-
board
mabel on a mountain	

to get vou in practise my dear-

   itll be a ten-day job to get those
people on no  down here bob said
rafferty late that afternoon after he

  bob taintor was no ordinary man
all that night alongside raff with his
clothes never once off he worked as he
had never worked before a new spirit
was given to the force the morning
saw promise of a road that was to be
clear in record time

  at least twice a day with the tireless
sloan the angel of the wire there were
coming in the snappiest clicks gay mes-
sages from mabel

  rafferty was right it was going to
be a ten-day job bob had been hoping
against hope from tremlow on the
edge of the foot-hills they sent out a
rotary the second afternoon

  before dark it was ditched as a good
railroad man bob mustered up his cour-
age and tried his very best not to be
downcast

  on the third morning a second rotary
went out from tremlow for a while
the anxious waiters in the trainmasters
office got good reports she made pilk-
ington  and as she slowly passed out of
sight from there she was still keeping
the tracks

  that was all the news that had come
to them for hours

  then just at dusk leaston the next
g

the railroad mans magazine

station beyond got the trainmaster on
the wire

    rotary ditched half a mile east of -
  here

rafferty  not by a darn sight wait

  with every assurance of raffs that
the jull was a sure thing and was
now coming along the santa fe he
flashed the news to mabel by the faith-
ful sloan the bride read the wire
slowly sloan stood waiting her orders
for they had become a very important
part of his life

   a week mused the little bride
poor boy i couldnt no i couldnt
wait a whole week longer mr sloan
do you think i could walk down to the
shanty 

   the winds the dead limit was the
answer

  but i must i just must its as

  she beckoned to him and whispered
rapidly into his ear

sloan  great bully  youre a-oh
miss mabel you are- but you dont
need to come down there honest you

of this car and run a line right in here

  she leaped to her feet and put both
her hands on his shoulders  youre
the best that ever was next to bob ill
never forget all youve done and bob
wont either she whispered once more
in sloans ear all you could hear was
the word  three

  the santa fe wired it was rushing
the jull  along and the reports of its
progress from station to station were

  very satisfactory but the inaction was
telling on bob what might have hap-
pened in another half day no one can
tell had not ivanhoe called him

  the speedy fingers of sloan hustled
along

   mr taintor miss mabel says for
  you to marry her at three to-morrow

                      almost wife

  sister elsie thought mabel was out
of her mind then the romance of the
situation struck her and she began to
smile

   its -perfectly lovely bob she ex-
patiated  you and mabelll remember
it all your lives and just think that
dick and i were married in an old par-
lor with two bridesmaids and two
ushers with wedding - cake and the

killing way as your nice pretty aunt
mabels going to be yum-yum-

  sloan had eight devoted assistants the
nexr morning concerning a line with the
first day-coach everything at the key
was made ready for the brides own
hand she had asked gretchen and
hilda to be her bridesmaids and had
even found some white ribbon in her
satchel to give a wedding-day air to their
braids the men of the party held a
meeting and unanimously chose the
mabel on a mountain	

old dr shillaber wont marry us did you ever hear of anything so horrid

denver business man to give the bride
away if she were willing

   my dear said that gentleman as
he looked into the blushing face  may
i have that honor

  she dimpled as she answered that
she  would be so glad then all
the preparations being complete they
lunched on the same old menu of game-
chicken and bottled beer

  proudly mrs helmzwitter and the
woman in widows black took upon
themselves the functions of unofficial
 mothers  to the bride as they were
brushing and patting and pullihg here
and there mabel was called to the wire

  she knew it was bob and she shiv-
ered a bit for she felt somehow it
must bebad news it was not three
oclock why should he call

   im a silly girl she said and she
went trippingly over to the key click-
flick rang out briskly click-click-
click her hands fell despairingly into
her lap

  what do you think she cried
 old dr shillaber wont marry us
did you ever hear of anything so horrid
and mean bob cant make him just
listen

  click-click-click click-click  bob
says he doesnt know im here he doesnt
really know he cant see me cant hear
my voice he says it may not only not
be mabel but perhaps a man this end of
the wire he cant marry that way

  on her own account she clicked away
sharply calling out the message she was
sending  tell him bob its me that

mabel-right here and all redy to say
 yes 

  click again from denver after a few
seconds wait click once more click-

the railroad mans magazine

exclaimed the denver business man
pushing to the little brides side   dr
james shillaber -i know shillaber
well and i wont stand-i-

 wait said the bride  please let
me perhaps a minister-ive an idea
her dainty fingers fell  the key and
made it fairly scurry she talked as she
sent

  bob never mind him get on your
  phone send for a justice of the peace
  try to get john buckner hell do any-
  thing for me im sure explain it all
  quick tell him to hurry

  two minutes-four-five then the
nervous clicking again

 hes coming hes coming bob
says he answered back  all right 
oh its hard to wait

  she slipped the locket from her neck
and opening it laid the picture of bob
before her the denver business man
put his arm about her shoulder caress-
ingly she smiled up into his face

  youre all so good she told him
come here dears she beckoned
the two tiny german girls lo her side
their mother petted her arm encourag-
ingly the clicks began again the
borrowed father softly stroked her hair

  john buckner knows its me the
bride called out entrancingly after she
had clicked back once or twice  hes

steel ties

consul h abert johnson of
liege states that in many of the lead-
ing industrial countries of europe the steel
railway tie is largely being substituted for
that of wood the consul says further
when these ties are carefully constructed
in order to meet the demands of the mod-
ern railway traffic they are in general
favored on account of their superior so-
lidity and power of resistance neverthe-
less their high price certain defects in
form and the absence so far of a con-
venient and simple mode of attachment have
prevented in a great measure their general
adoption although they are being more ex-
tensively utilized

  it is asserted that the english manufac-
turers have on the market a tie  profile en
rigole grooved section that sells for
 per ton or less than the present cost

been an operator i am sure that he can
tell my touch

  almost dreamily now she followed the
clicking that went on and on saying a
word here and there that told the listen-
ers how the ceremony was progressing

  click-click-click and more came over
the wire  will you take this man-
she breathed her fingers instantly
pressed down her sender

   yes 

  there was a whirl more of clicks back
and forth you could seem to tell of
the joy on the wire the swede the
drummers the german frau the woman
in widows black the farmers the ele-
gant glen wood springs lawyer jack
simpson and the denver business man
deliriously congratulated each other
at length the bride sprang up her face
aglow

   everybody remember to say  mrs
bob  now she laughed gaily  shes
all here but the wedding-ring bobs
bringing that and john buckners com-
ing with him to see that its put  right

   were going to have the loveliest
most romantic wedding breakfast and
youre all invited bob and john buck-
ner are going to follow up the  jull
theyre coming with toboggans and
snow-shoes andll get us down the
mountain on those what do you say
to that 

in europe

of wooden ties it is evident therefore-
that under these conditions the use of the
steel tie would produce decided economical
results for the railways

 a good steel tie of moderate price is
urgently needed by the railways of europe
and the prospect of supplying such a demand
might he worth the consideration of ameri-
can steel works the adoption of metal
ties is especially necessary in certain locali-
ties to prevent the rapid destruction of
forests it is estimated that in europe a
mile of railway line requires about 
cross-ties every twelve years which means
the cutting of an enormous quantity of
forest trees it is also estimated that the
railways consume something like 
ties a year and this consumption is said
to be increasing at the rate of  a
year
letters of an old railroad
man and his son

by herman da costa

no -jim gets a job in the general managers
office on his dads old line

some good men run on the sidings but theres a reason why they
are never able to pull out on the
main line again

from jim to the old man

ear dad  as you see 
got here safely i went
right up to the young
mens christian associa-
tion and they put me next
 to a boarding-place and
gave me tlie glad hand  pay five dol-
lars a week for all the comforts of home

  the comfort i like best about it is the
landlady im the only boarder she has
got and shes always running up to look
after me

  i wandered around town the first few
days looking for a job thats what you
have to do here they dont come to
you  guess i went to as many as thirty
places a day

  of course the work was somewhere
it was merely the looking for it but 
tell you it must be tough luck looking for
work when you begin to lose confidence

   finally landed a job in the b and
g i walked into the general managers
office and sat outside the rail for about
fifteen minutes waiting for somebody to
come to me people came in and out the
gate would look at me and rush on
again  so i got tired waiting opened the
gate and went in a big fellow was sit-
ting in a corner of the room

he looked like the boss so i went over

to him and asked for the general mana-
ger he asked me what i wanted i
told him a job and gave him my name
he thought for a minute

    know anything about stenography
he asked

    i studied stenography and typewri-
ting

   can you do the work 

   i think i can

  he frowned  are you sure you
can 

  i saw what he wanted so i said
 yes

  he made me sit down and take some
letters and got me to read them back to
him its enough to rattle anybody get-
ting up agaiiist that kind of proposition
and i told him i wasnt sure whether it
was a fair test

   i am he says  we want a man
here who can read his notes in a hurry
when theyre wanted and not have to gal-
lop between his desk and mine asking
if i said this and if  didnt say that
i pay him to do my work if he needs
assistance on it then well hire his as-
sistant-and let him out

  that was going some wasnt it well
i made a bluff at it then he got me
over to the typewriter i knew i had him
there with all the practise i had he

gave me two or three letters on the ma-




the railroad mans magazine

chine then he asked me if i knew any-
thing about telegraphy

   i told him  a little

  are you willing to learn it he
said

    i am willing to do anything that will
get me a job in this office i was begin-
ning to seewhat he liked

  he smiled at that then got me over to
his desk and dictated about twenty let-
ters to me then i had to go to the ma-
chine and write them when i had fin-
ished he was out of the office

   i noticed that things were rather mixed
up-letters lying around loose on his
desk ink-well without ink in it dust
everywhere it looked a mess and i
pitched in and straightened up the desk
dusted it cleaned and filled the ink-well
fixed some clean pens and sharpened
some pencils for him

   then i piled my letters in front of his
chair by that time he came in he
looked at the desk looked at me then
sat down and began running over the let-
ters i only made about ten thousand
mistakes in those twenty letters that is
i was watching him and he would read
a little way grab a pen scratch lift up
read a little way again scratch read
scratch

  i wanted to get my hat and get out
before he jumped on me as the rottenest
stenographer he ever saw but something
tied me to that chair and all i could do
was to look miserable then he threw
me the letters

   address envelopes he said not
another word i picked em up and ad-
dressed the envelopes there werent as
many mistakes as i expected but there
were enough i took the letters back to
him and reached for my hat

   wait a minute he says  we dont
quit work here till five-thirty

  while i was getting that through my
head he had picked up another letter
and was starting to dictate it  grabbed
for my book and managed to get it he
gave me about thirty more letters and i
did a little better with them for there
wasnt so much scratching when he signed
em up

  about five-thirty he swung around in
his chair

    britt he said  the hours are from
eight to five-thirty  practically we work

until we finish the pay is sixty dollars
a month and listen you mean well
but please leave my desk alone youll
have enough to keep you busy at your own
work

  i was thinking

   whats the matter asked connol-
ly i had heard somebody call him by
that name dont like the work

   no i said slowly  i wasnt sure-
that is i was thinking whether i could
do it

   leave that to us im paid to find
that out if you cant ill fire you in a
week and let me tell you something
else be a little more sure about things
it sounds bad to hear billy britts son
talking like that

  say dad that knockcd me in a heap

i had forgotten all about your working
for the b and g

   ill take it and thank you mr con-
nolly i said

   no need to thank me as long as you
do the work he says

  it hasnt been as hard work as i
thought there are about six people in
the office besides mr connolly and my-
self ill tell you about them in my next
letter and dad i saw t f hes a
six-footer thin-lipped man with blue
eyes that look like two dots of steel i
like him

  ive only made one bad break so far
a man from the superintendents office
rushed in here the other day and wanted
to know if the-peach-train was to be run
extra over his division i wasnt sure
but i had seen some correspondence about
the peach-train running on s schedule
so i told him to run it as 

  he grinned and hunted up the c c
afterward the c c came to me and told
me that if i wasnt sure about anything
in future to ask him first

  afterward  found out that  was an
evening passenger and if it had run on
s schedule the fruit would have had to
be re-iced

  the general managers office is the big-
gest place on the road im glad i got
in it every orte has to come to us for
instructions ive noticed lots of things
that could be improved around the office
and am making up a list of them when
the time looks favorable ill show it to the
chief clerk
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

give my love to mother and write me  switch-engine does a heap of work and

when you get the time

your affectionate son

 jim

the mogul is mighty expensive

 when i used to run  up to wayne
 junction twice a day there was a young
 fellow in the general superintendents
 office that thought because they let him
 write letters to the superintendent about
 dear jim your mother and i were delays to fast trains he was in charge of
 glad to get your letter and we were - the line imagined he was the cheese

from the old man to jim

he looked like the boss so i went over to him

more glad to know that you had landed
a job in the office not that the office
is better to learn in than the yard-
eighty per cent of the men that ever suc-
ceeded in railroading started in the yard
or somewhere on the division-but you
will be able to get in touch with operating
headquarters and inspected by the men
who run the road

  one thing however you want to re-
member-you are waiting on the siding
as yet because you are in the general
managers office dont mean you have the
right of way over the entire division

  the average young fellow that gets in
the office that runs things is apt to be-
lieve hes a mogul and capable of show-
ing tilings to a switch-engine but the

  one day bob sent out a long letter
demanding a reason for  stopping at
bulls five minutes for a hot box the
whole bunch of correspondence came to
me and after looking it over i went up
to t fs office when  came in t f
was superintendent at that time and had
a reputation as the best man on the b
and g to work for

  incidentally t f had a string of cuss-
words that was a matter of envy for a
section-boss i handed it to t f and
showed him what the letter was about
he hiked right up to the g ss office

   who in the blankety-blank-blank
wrote this he roared the chief clerk
looked at it and hollered for bob bob
popped up


the railroad mans magazine

   you write this letter son asked

 jr f

   bob had seen t f before and knew
 t f had seen him

    why yes mr fitzgerald didnt
 you see my initials there and while
 youre here theres some other things i
 want to haul you up about

   bobby was getting in his stride he
 was going to make a hit with the c c
 he thought smart boy 

     who the blankety-blank are you any-
 way  roared t f

   bobby butted in  me why you
 know me im robert smith says bob-
by some surprised that t f had for-
gotten his name

    t f was staggered then he regained
 speech  you are are you well look-a-
 here young man you seem a blankety-
 blank sight too much worried about this
 road blank it who in the blankety-
 blank-blank is sending that train through
 -you or me  

    bob started to explain when t f shut
 him off

    look-a-here said t f  while
 youre about it have you got an idea
 what a hot box is

   it stuck bobby he had never been
 out in the yards his idea of a railroad
 was gained from thrilling stories where
 the engineer sticks to his engine and goes
 down with it in the collision he was
 too proud to ask questions for fear of
 being laughed at and too busy with the-
 aters and giggling petticoats to find out
 for himself

   the delay had looked mighty bad to
 him from the office standpoint and he
 proceeded to jump on t f for what he
 called an  outrageous  delay there
 are a heap of fellows like bobby in the
 world-too hasty in doing things and not
 taking the trouble to find out if they are
 right before they go ahead

   the funny thing about bobby though
 was that t f had him transferred to his
 office the boy had the makings of a
 man in him and t f put him through
 the mill to-dav youll find bobby su-
 perintendent of a division on your road
 thats the kind of a man t f was when
 lie got ihe right material

    dont you get it into your head that
 because youre in the office you have
 got charge of the line orders are or-

 ders and the men will obey them when
 they come right but it dont pay to call
 down people when you dont know if you
 know what you are talking about keep
 your mouth shut until you know you
 will usually find that the fellow that
 knows will keep his mouth shut even then
 and only open it when hes called upon
 do your own work well and you wont
 have time to volunteer advice about the
 other fellows

  the boss has lots of advice about other
peoples work he hired you to do your
work do it which doesnt mean that
you shouldnt offer good suggestions-
but be sure they are good and wanted be-
fore you offer them

  you dont want to forget that the en-
gine standing on the sidingwith its steam
up is always used keep your steam up
and dont use it hunting up other engines
to see that they are working right you
arent paid for that thats the bosss job

  if he finds you ar all right he will
use you for other work besides your own
and you can depend upon it he wouldnt
be boss if he couldnt find that out he
might get along for a little time if he
wasnt in good order but the chief
inspector would soon find it out and
theres where the engine that does its
work right gets the main track dont
depend on a helper its all right in a
tight fix but you might get the habit of
always wanting one

  this isnt advice jim its common
sense your mother sends her love

                your affectionate

fath er

from jim to the old man

  dear dad whats the point if i
said in my last letter that  had charge
of the office i didnt mean it its true
i had a lot of suggestions about im-
proving thingsthat i was going to- show
mr connolly but one day i asked him
why he had taken me when so many
more men in other departments wanted
the job

   well he said  all those other men
were primed with suggestions about how
i could improve the office and i wanted
a man who didnt know anything so that
i could get a chance to attend to that part
myself
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

   mind you he added  i like good
suggestions but these fellows didnt look
at it from that view they wanted to
make them so that i would see how good
they were

  how was that for a close call dad
after that ive been going ahead attend-
ing strictly to my work and trying to make
it better wherever i could nothing big
you know

   i would copy all the letters during the
c cs dinner-hour i indexed all the
letter - books up to
date and tackled the
routine correspond-
ence for him and
just yesterday i was
standing at the filing-
desk when a fellow
came in from the
superintendents office
and went up to con-
nolly

  he talked for a
while and then saw
me

   pi owls the new
man  he asked

 keeping his
mouth shut his eyes
open and attending
to his own business
snapped connolly

    good   says the
man but it hit him
hard he was the
fellow that had come
in and asked me about
putting the peach-train
about three weeks ago
you have no idea how
me feel

   i forgot to tell you about my first ex-
perience in the office the first morning
that i came to work regularly i was down
at seven oclock there wasnt a thing i
could do i didnt know how they ran the
office yet or where they filed their stuff
or anything so i had a lot of spare time
on my hands until the chief clerk came
down

  i knew what he was thinking he had
me sized up as one of these way-ahead-of-
time - for - a - week - and - late - the -
rest-of-the-year fellows at noon-time
he came over to my machine and stood
watching me

    britt he said after a minute  did
i tell you the hours were from eight to
five-thirty 

   i guess i got red around the ears for
he didnt wait for me to answer but
walked back to his desk

   t f came out of his office the other

 look-a-here have you got an idea what a hot box is

on as an extra
and say dad
proud that made

day and asked me how you were and
what you were doing almost everybody
knows you and they seem to think that
i ought to know all about railroading in
five minutes ill have a hard time living
up to your reputation

   theres a fellow here in the office
named john lynes black-haired me-
dium-sized talks in a contradictory
voice he sings in some church choir
he has taken me in hand and told me
a good many things aboukpeople in the
office he explained to me how the
schedules are made too  guess thats
why i like him

   hes been with the road for twenty-
five years and is getting seventy - five
dollars a month adding up columns of
figures on tonnage reports think of


the railroad mans magazine

that dad twenty-five years with the
road and only getting fifteen a month
more than i am

  i have often wondered why he hasnt
been promoted for he knows everything
about train schedules and things of that
sort

  he is awfully touchy gets mad in a
minute if anybody crosses him every-
body in the office fights shy of him but
at bottom he is a big-hearted fellow and
always willing to help you out if you
go to him

  right opposite lynes sits pat niff a
gray-haired man used to be on the
monongah division as despatcher wears
a size eight hat hes got a memory
thats wonderful i dont understand
what work he is doing but its-something
about the running of fast freight and
watching them to see that certain cars go
through all right

  pat is something like lynes only
lynes will get angry and not speak a
word for a week and pat will forget he
is mad inside of ten minutes pats been
with the roatd thirty-five years and he
gets seventy-five dollars a month i
cant understand it dad here are two
men who know- as much about handling
trains as any man in the office except
t f and yet they make one-third of
what connolly gets and connolly has
been with the road only three years

  theres a big difference between con-
nolly and those two men he can get
work out of them when nobody else can
and he doesnt know as much about the
office details as they do and i know he
often goes to them for advice i notice
when he does he asks them for it as if
they are able to give it better than any-
body else he usualfy gets it too its
funny watching the two men give it

  lynes says what he has to say and
stops the c c will ask j him about
something of which he isnt sure and
lynes will explain it then if the c c
suggests something better lynes will get
angry and stick out for his way the
c c will try to explain to him but it
only makes lynes more angry and final-
ly he wont say anything at all really
the c c very seldom goes to him for
that reason

  if he asks pat anything pat will keep
on talking even after the c c under-

stands  and when the c c starts to go
away pat gets up and follows him still
talking to his desk and keeps on ex-
plaining matters the c c looks wor-
ried and annoyed and wants to tell him
to shut up but cant and finally pat
gives out stands for a few minutes at the
desk not knowing what to say then goes
back to his desk stopping on the way
to talk to everybody when he lands at
his desk he shuffles his papers around
looks up with a pleased smile on his face
and doesnt get down to work for a
quarter of an hour afterward

   but say dad i tell you this railroad
 work is simply great i like it immense-
 ly i am beginning to take hold in pretty
 good shape and lynes says i am improv-
 ing right along i would be a fool if i
 didnt

   just last week i started up a system
of filing they have a filing-clerk here
but hes not much good so when sat-
urday afternoon came-we get a holiday
then--i persuaded him to let me look
over the files and jollied him along
hes something like lynes-touchy-so
i made him believe that he gave me the
idea and now the filing is in fine shape
i help him out whenever i get a chance
from my other work

   theres another thing that ought to be
 cut out thats lyness work he could
 be put on the filing-desk with the file-
 man theres work there for two people
 easily im going to tell the c c when
 he is in a good humor

   could you guess from my first letter
that i was homesick i tried to hide
it but i was for the first day or so
since ive been here though ive had
to work too hard to get a chance to think
 about it	

   there are lots of opportunities here
 and im glad i came with them of
 course  dont expect to be president
 right away but there are a barrelful of
 other places below- that i can learn to
 fill im going to learn too

    if mother asks how  am tell her im
 getting along fine and give her my love

                   affectionately

                         - jim

                                                   

from the old man to jim

   dear jim  enthusiasm is all right in
 its way but the kind of enthusiasm i have
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

 run up against in my time lias been usual-
 ly the kind that talks about itself that
 doesnt pay

  you may fool yourself into believing
you are exploding with pride in the line
but there is another kind of enthusiasm-
its the working kind

  the man who has it keeps his mouth
shut and goes out and works he cant
afford to waste time telling how the serv-
ice might be improved if he could only
be put in charge of it but he goes up
to liis chief clerk or to whoever is in
authority and finds out by a little tactful
questioning how that official would re-
ceive a suggestion and then makes it so
that his superior officer will believe its
the right thing

   you dont see that kind of a man often
why because were all more or less
children and have to be coaxed and
pushed and wheedled-something like
homer bastrops engine  the monon-
gali division

  homer was a patient enduring sort of
cussor he would never have gotten that
engine to work the way it did she
would sashay along loooj-wo-oj-wo-of-
---f and she would back right up and
stand plumb still with the gage up in
the hundreds and the boiler getting hot-
ter and hotter the first time she did
it homer ran her in the shop for over-
hauling but they couldnt find anything
wrong with her

  then she began to do it regular and
homer got mad and madder finally
one day he began talking to it-got se-
rious then became sentimental and al-
most cried over her and denied if she
didnt get right back into action again

  so after that whenever she got in her
tantrums homer would roll out a string
of loving words and in about five min-
utes she would be clipping along again
it worked the deuce with the train sched-
ule though and they cut her out after a
while and put her to hauling coal

  homer had simply learned that she
had to have a wheedling to get in action
a good many people know that coaxing
will get what cussing cant but they only
apply it to certain things pat odays
boy was like that

  the old man was about as close-fisted
as he could be his hand had held the
throttle so long that when he got money

in it you had to pry it open to get it
away again and moren likely he would
be changing it to the other hand while
you were getting at it but that boy of
his never thought about using a crow-
bar to get it no sir

  he would get the old man talking
about engines and freights and improve-
ments in the service and what he had
done for the- company and he would sit
there with one ear cocked up listening
respectfully and now and then putting
in what the lawyers would call a  lead-
ing  question - and when he had his
hand oiled enough it would just open
naturally and a five or ten dollar bill
would slip out

  and mind you pat oday was the
man who when t f was caught on the
line one day without change and wanted
to borrow five dollars told him he wanted
security for it

  come to office work though the boy
was different he would sulk and grum-
ble when anybody tried to show him how
to do a thing right and suspicious  he
didnt trust a soul he was always
afraid they were after his job

  he forgot to apply to his every-day
life the oil that he applied to his dad
thats the trouble with most of us

   we are always watching to see that he
dont tread on our corns then some
day along comes a fellow who hides the
hurt when you tread  his smiles when
you cuss at him doesnt give out forcible
opinions without first knowing yours
keeps from quarrels and never complains
about his abilities being unrecognized-
and before you know it he is your chief
clerk and running things smoothly too
and you wonder why he was pushed
above your head

  no doubt you were a better man than
he was you knew more about the office
details and were more honest with your
feelings and man enough to not let any
one almse you

  right there was your trouble the
big-minded man can afford to let such
things pass because he would have to be
small to notice them  know what small
annoyances are but hang it if you
passed up one the next would come
easier and finally you wouldnt notice
them any more

   pats boy had to blow off steam when-


the railroad mans magazine

ever anything jarred him and pretty soon
he was blowing it off all the time when
he should have been applying it to what
he was paid for-his work his flues
were bad and he wouldnt let any one
help him take em out and so they just
naturally ran him to the scrap heap and
you couldnt blame them

  if i buy a big engine and put it out

day with the company its made me
stick with them and im going to stick
now till  get to be general manager
funny wasnt it and where is he
now hes not only g m but ill bet
hes the best g m the b and g ever
had and hell be the best president
they ever had too and hes as enthusi-
astic now as he ever was

if he asks pat anything pat will keep on talking even after
the c c understands

to haul fst freight i want it to do the
work thats what i bought it for i
didnt buy it to send it to the repair-
shop every ten minutes i want it out
on the main line pulling a string of cars
not standing on a siding

  none of your five-minute enthusiasm
for me when i first went with the
b and g  made up my mind i would
look on every day as the clay i was just
starting to work for them and i tell
you you have no idea how interesting it
got to be it was a regular picnic t f
your general manager was section-boss
at the time and one day he and i were
talking about what we wanted

   ill tell you bill he said  when
i came with this road i made up my
mind i would look on every day as a new

to be c

  that enthusiasm of his got the b and
g into chicago when the combine was
against them it got him the peach traf-
fic from the south after the d r r
had held it for fifteen years got him the
government mail when he bid three cents
higher than anybody else to competitive
points got him a twenty-yearcontract
with the american paint company-and
heaven knows what else

  why does he get it all  because he
uses his steam for a purpose he doesnt
waste it thats the working kind of
enthusiasm

  it doesnt make as loud a pop as char-
lie odays did but it has a heap more
action and go to it

              your affectionate

father

ntinued 
the stuff that helps the
wheels go round

by horace h smith

there are three main factors in transportation they are propulsion
lubrication and check of momentum of these practically equal factors
lubrication has been the least spectacular and perhaps the most difficult
of satisfactory solution the railroads groped about for many years blindly
experimenting with almost anything that would give a greasy coating to
friction-producing parts the results were worse than nil and money flowed
through overheated bearings in the shape of hot boxes and wrecks until a
man came who recognized the need of the scientific application of a scientific
lubricant	

from the use of pork strips to up-drop lubricators and the highest
grade of lubricating oil is a far cry but the railroads
had to make it in the last fifty years

to cover a square mile of territory to a
depth of more than two inches the
george washington the largest german
steamship afloat with its displacement
of  tons would displace only
about  gallons of oil

  the quantity used every year would
float four george washingtons and
more than seven of the famed dread-
nought class of battle-ships

it costs the railroads close to -

	a month to keep the wheels turning
smoothly under the methods and with
the oils that were in use when the gray-
haired hut still active railroad men of
to-day were bovs the cost would be
many times as great

  even as recently as only twenty years
ago when the equipment was much
s r r	

n no branch of the railroad
 i service has there been such a
great advance as in the qual-
a i ity of the oils that are used
and the methods of their
 application from an easy
way of causing trouble and wasting
money lubrication has become an art
a means of expediting traffic saving
labor and material and increasing net
earnings

  every day american railroads con-
sume over  gallons of oil the
annual consumption which approximates
 gallons would till nearly
 tank-cars and make a train fifty
miles in length

the oil would weigh about 
tons and there would be enough of it


the railroad mans magazine

lighter than now the lubrication of a
passenger-car cost over one dollar per
one thousand miles while freight-ears
cost from thirty to fifty cents to-day
-a twelve-journal passenger-coach costs
only twelve cents for oil per one thou-
sand miles and an eight-journal freight-
car costs about five cents

expense of hot boxes

  the direct cost of a hot box is from
ten to twelve dollars to say nothing
of the loss of time of the train-crews
that are delayed by it in addition and
most important of all there is always
the danger that a hfcated journal will
precipitate a disastrous and expensive
wreck which may involve loss of life

  accidents resulting from hot boxes
which often were attended by fatalities
were of frequent occurrence a quarter
of a century ago but now they are un-
heard of of course the advance in
equipment and methods is partly respon-
sible for this but when all the lacts
are considered it will be appreciated
that oil is a subject of vital importance
alike to the railroads and to the people
who work for them and travel over
them

  in the early days of railroading
lubricating appliances were as crude as
the engines and as unsatisfactory as the
oils that were used the oil for driving-
journals was fed through holes which
often were filled with wicking tocheck
the flow running from the top of the
box which was filled with waste an
open-top cup on the steam-chest carried
oil for the valves and cylinders

  in  a technical journal in de-
scribing a  special fast passenger-en-
gine weighing fifteen tons and built to
run ninety-seven miles in two hours and
a half called attention to a new feature
 a handsome brass reservoir secured to
the side of the boiler lioldijig half a
gallon of oil with pipes leading to the
different journals each supplied with
cock for letting down oil at the pleasure
of the engineer while running

  even then though the idea did not
bear full fruit until nearly twenty years
later railroad men were thinking of
economies in  the american rail-
road journal said

    perhaps there is no other article so
 liable to waste as oil it is often the
 case that the method of lubrication is
 such that it is difficult  to see when
 enough oil is communicated without
 using double the quantity needed
 should not this fact suggest some im-
 provement in oil-cups cannot some
 man of genius get up some lubricator
 which will feed itself automatically 
 that question has of course been an-
 swered many times since then in 
 nicholas seibert a california engineer
 introduced the first down-drop feed
 lubricator operated by the hydrostatic
 displacement principle

   the first up-drop lubricator was in-
vented in  by john gates of port-
land oregon these inventions were
gradually developed and improved upon
until the establishment of the methods
in use to-day which now seem incapable
of improvement but which will in their
turn give way to something better

   there is an abundance of data regard-
 ing the development of railroad equip-
 ment but the early records contain very
 little regarding lubrication it is as-
 sumed however from the fact that they
 then were in general use in europe for
 machine lubrication that vegetable oils
 and chiefly olive oils were used on the
 first american roads

pork as a lubricant

   subsequently it appears that in the
general search for something which
would answer the needs anything that
contained grease was experimented with
even soft soap was tried and another
genius whose suggestion seems to have
been taken more seriously advocated the
use of strips of fat pork

   under the heading  pork for jour-
nal boxes a trade paper inquired with
apparent anxiety

  why not use it we have asked
fifty railroad men within so many days
if they were aware of its success on
the hudson river railroad a car was
packed with slices of fresh pork and is
to-day as good as it was a year ago the
cost per box for pork packing that will
stand a year will not exceed thirty cents
still in spite of this advice pork does
not appear to have been widely adopted
the stuff that helps the y heels go round 

 as a lubricant in the vernacular of the
 day the road which would try to use it
 now would look like the amount then
 set down as the annual cost per journal-
 box

eating into steel

  sperm and cotton-seed oils were tried
and abandoned and gradually lard and
fish oils came into general use for jour-
nals and machinery and tallow for
valves and cylinders they did not give
satisfaction blit were used for want of
something better

  the destruction of steam-chests and
cylinders from the corrosion caused by
the fatty acids in the animal oils cost
the railroads millions of dollars annually
all animal fats have three well-known
acids oleic stearic and butyric in ad-
dition to which there is much solid mat-
ter commonly known as  stearine
from which tallow candles are made

  this gummy and non-lubricating part
of the oil collected on the non-bearing
surfaces of the steam-chests and cylin-
ders and gathered and held the fatty
acids which were liberated by the steam
at high temperatures these acids at
the same time that they decomposed the
stearine ate back through the metal
until it became so honeycombed and
fibrous that it was possible to run the
blade of a knife for three inches or more
into what had once been solid steel

  with the greases that were used for
exterior lubrication it required more
powter to haul the trains for the reason
that heat had to be generated by the
friction of the journal before it would
absorb any of the oil dirt and dust
accumulated on top of the grease and
became mixed with it and many hot
boxes resulted

temporary solution

  this insistent demand was met a few
years later by the discovery that crude
west virginia oil as pumped from the
wells was an excellent railroad lubri-
cant this oil was at first supposed to
be of no value for the reason that it
contained none of the volatile qualities
from which illuminating oils are made

  thus the refiners could not use it
but the producers unwilling to throw

it away stored it in immense tanks hold-
ing thousands of barrels they offered
it for-sale at as low a price as one dol-
lar a barrel but there was no purchaser

   finally j m foss superintendent of
motive power and machinery of the cen-
tral vermont railroad fried it as a
lubricant and found it so satisfactory
that its use soon became general and
the price advanced rapidly to thirty
cents a gallon

  this oil had a low cold test and a
flash test of   degrees and was- en-
tirely free from gum grit or tarry sub-
stance the supply of it however was
limited when the last well which pro-
duced it had been pumped dry refiners
throughout the country undertook to
meet the demand for petroleum oils by
extracting all of the volatile qualities
from the ordinary crude oils and con-
verting what was left over into lubri-
cating oil

   this residuum was a thick tarry sub-
stance which as it stood was altogether
unsuited for railroad lubrication and the
only way by which it could be adapted
to such purposes was to mix it with
lighter oil to give it the necessary fluid-
ity it is interesting to note hee in
passing that tor ten years the refiners
threw- this tarry mass into the river on
the assumption that it could be put to
 useful purpose

more makeshift relief

  while the oils that were produced
from this black mass were very low
priced a great deal of trouble was ex-
perienced in their use as they lacked
sufficient  body  to properly lubricate
the equipment it was about this time
in  that general charles miller
of franklin pennsylvania began the
manufacture of galena oils under a se-
cret process invented by a man named
hendricks like most inventors hen-
dricks was unpractical and not know-
ing how to use his discovery he sold
out for six thousand dollars in addition
to which he was to receive a royalty of
one dollar on every barrel of oil that
was sold

  not long afterward he sold out his
royalty interest for sixthousand dollars
in cash had lie retained this right he


the railroad mans magazine

would have received more than two mil-
lion dollars during the life of the patent

  by the process which he invented
oxide of lead is combined with crude
petroleum whale oil and other ingre-
dients in perfect solution with the re-
sult that the product has a consistency
which preserves the necessary film of oil
between the bearing surfaces for long
periods and without regard to weather
climate or speed in this way the crude
petroleum of west virginia was im-
proved upon

a discovery at last

  oxide of lead performs a peculiar
purpose by filling the interstices of the
bearing surfaces making them perfectly
smooth and putting them in a condition
which insures the most perfect lubrica-
ting action of the fluid elements of the
oils

  genera miller has been the sole di-
recting genius of his company from the
day it was organized forty years ago
and has seen it grow from nothing to
the greatest concern of its kind in the
world recognition was by no means
instantaneous general miller had all
the struggles of a pioneer

   it was a hard fight at first he
says for our oils while less expensive
than the fatty oils which were still
largely used were much more expensive
than the so-called petroleum oils made
from the residuum from volatile oils
for the latter reason the supply houses
refused to handle them and we were
compelled to deal directly with the rail-
roads which no manufacturer had done
up to that time

   j r nicholls general purchasing-
agent for the union pacific was my
first customer i solicited him for an
order and he told me to send him fifty
barrels with the understanding that if
it was good lie would pay for it while
if it was not good he would pay noth-
ing i had plenty of faith but not a
great deal of capital so i compromised
by sending him three barrels

  they were sufficient to prove all of
my claims and we soon received an or-
der for fifty barrels which was quickly
followed by a still larger one as we
began to make inroads  the makers of

other oils we were challenged to make
several competitive tests all of which
we won

   my first big order came from collis
p huntington president of the south-
ern pacific he wrote me asking for
a price on our oils in large quantities

   instead of writing him i took the
first train for new york determined to
see him i was at his office early the
next morning but at the door i was
overcome with nervousness

   the prospect of interviewing the
greatest railroad man in the world as he
was then properly regarded and of be-
ing put to a test on my prices which i
had firmly decided would be maintained
at the established scale without regard
to the purchaser or the quantity was
temporarily too much for me i re-
treated-in rather bad order i fear

   i walked around the block for an
hour or two and smoked several cigars
before i mustered up enough courage to
return to his office and ask to see mr
huntington i was greatly relieved
when i was told he was out of the city

   i left my card with a request that

i	be advised of his return and at what
hour he would see me a week or so
later i returned to new york in re-
sponse to a telegram and was at his
office at the appointed time though i
must confess that i approached it with
something of the former fear and trem-
bling

breaking into espee

   mr huntington received me in his
brusk way and asked me the price of
my oils i quoted him the price for the
different kinds-car coach and valve

     youll have to do better than that
he said  ours is a big road

    i started to tell him of the superior
qualities of my oils but he interrupted
me with  i know all about your oils
if youll make the price right ill give
you an order for five car-loads

   for a moment i was stunned by the
size of the prospective order and
paralyzed by the fear of losing it
furthermore my oils were then being
used from the atlantic as far west as
ogden and i was anxious to have them
running clear across the continent

   the temptation to cut the price was
the stuff that helps the wheels go round 

strong but i knew if  ever started that
business there would be no endto it
so i resolved to stick to my guns after
l had run the whole situation over in
my mind i told him if it would be any
accommodation to him i would let him
havefive car-loads at the same price

   mr huntington threw himself back
in his chair and laughed loudly at
first i thought he was ridiculing me but
when he sobered down he gave me the
order for five car-loads without any fur-
ther argument we became close friends
after that and were subsequently inter-
ested together in several enterprises in-
cluding the construction of a line of
railroad which is now a part of the
chesapeake and ohio system

    start of a great system

   not long after this incident i had
a somewhat similar experience with john
f lincoln general superintendent of
the st paul and sioux city railroad

i	had been calling on him regularly for
several years without selling him a pint
of oil for i would not cut pjices

   after i had been trying for months
to get him to sign a three-year contract
at a guaranteed maximum cost for lubri-
cation while he was standing out fol-
lower gallon prices lie suddenly turned
on me and said  if you will make the
contract for five years i will agree to
your terms

   i felt much as i did when mr

ii	untington gave me the order for five
car-loads but concealed my surprise and
gratification and told him that while
five years was a long time i would let
him have his way about it

   that was the first of our five-year
contracts on a guaranteed maximum
mileage cost basis which system i
adopted for the reason that under it
more conclusively than by any other i
could prove the faith that was in me
in the development of this plan  em-
ployed experts always selecting the most
capable men i could find who were as-
signed to the roads which entered into
contracts of this kind to instruct the
employees in the efficient and e onomi-
cal use of our oils

  this system worked out very satisfac-
iorilv both to the railroads and our-

selves and it is now  general use by
this plan a railroad manager knows that
hi cost of lubrication for a year or a
term of years will not exceed the max-
imum cost stated in the guarantee while
it may fall below it

   no matter how much oil is used
any amount paid inexcess of the guar-
antee is refunded to the road at the end
of the year if through hearty co-
operation with our experts less oil is
needed than was figured on as necessary
in fixing the guarantee the road saves
the difference

   the constant effort of our experts
is to decrease the quantity of oil used 
to increase the miles run by engines
coaches and cars to every pint of oil
we now have about one hundred ex-
perts at work in this country and in
many foreign lands

   the records show that as a result
of the scientific use of a scientific lubri-
cant there is not more than one hot box
now where there were a thousand twenty-
five years ago when we entered into
a contract with the new york central
the hot box record between new york
and buffalo averaged one hundred and
twenty-nine daily in the passenger serv-
ice alone

   to-day with more than four times
as many trains running at the highest
speed including one of the fastest long-
distance trains in the world there are
less than one hundred and twenty-nine
hot boxes in a year

                                               v

matters of record

  in the old days oil was stored at prac-
tically every stopping place and it was
thrown into the journal boxes with reck-
less prodigality whether it was needed
or not all of this waste and labor are
avoided by the methods which general
miller has introduced oil is shipped
in tank-cars or barrels to the general
storage points at terminals and from
there the general superintendent dis-
tributes it to the consuming stations
which generally are located at division
points

  there the division storekeeper turns
it over to the foreman of the oiling sta-
tion who keeps an accurate and de-
tailed record of its distribution each


the railroad mans magazine

engineer draws the scheduled quantity
of valve and engine oil required to take
him over his run the experts have it so
finely figured out that they know how
much he will need under normal condi-
tions and with a liberal allowance for
contingencies

  if an engineer exceeds his allowance
he is required to put in an extra ticket
with an explanation the records of the
oilers who attend to the passenger and
freight cars are kept in the same way

  at the end of the month tables are
posted at division points showing the
miles run by each engine and by each
engineer per pint of oil per ton of coal
and the cost of his repairs it is the
desire of every engineer to stand at the
head of this list and the same ambition
fires the car and coach oilers so there is
a minimum of waste

oiling transcontinental

  oil is applied scientifically as well as
economically when a transcontinental
passenger-train starts east it is fully
oiled at oakland at ogden after a
run of seven hundred and seventy-five
miles and again at omaha one thousand
miles farther east it is lightly reoiled
and it is freshly oiled again at chicago
before it returns westward

  improved methods of packing have
also been introduced tests and expe-
rience have shown that one pound of
waste either woolen or cotton will ab-
sorb from four to six pints of oil the
waste is soaked in oil for thirty-six or
forty-eight hours and is then drained
until all of the loose oil has dripped off
then with the waste holding just
enough oil so it will ooze through the
fingers when tightly gripped it is care-
fully packed in the boxes with none of
it in front of the journals

  old waste instead of being thrown
away is put through a cleaning process
which makes it as good as new and all
of the oil it holds is reclaimed and put
through a strainer and filter and restored
to service

  the results which these methods have
accomplished are illustrated by a recent
test on the norfolk and western rail-
way on may   baggage-car
 running between bluefield west

virginia and wilcox was fitted with
new brasses and freshly oiled with five
gallons of oil to ten pounds of waste
and the boxes were sealed

  about once a month the foreman in
charge of coaches would open the boxes
and stir up the packing if necessary
but no oil was added the car was in
continuous service and up to march 
-twenty-two months from the time
the test began-when it was transferred
to another division it had run 
miles at a cost for oil of one dollar

near a worlds record

  the car was running smoothly when
it was transferred and did not seem to
need reoiling it is believed that if its
record had been transferred with it a
new worlds record might have been
established

  on october   on the same
road coach  was freshly oiled sup-
plied with new brasses and put in serv-
ice under similar conditions on octo-
ber   this car was taken away
from bluefield and the test was ended
at that time it had run  miles
and it was reported that the packing was
 in very good condition

   the working out of this system of ex-
pert supervision and the extent to which
the railroads have profited by it were
strikingly shown by figures recently
brought out in connection with the gov-
ernments extensive inquiry into the oil
industry

government evidence

  on seventy american systems inclu-
ding all of the important lines it was
shown that for the period from  to
 inclusive there had been a saving
of from twenty to eighty per cent in the
cost of lubrication per ton mile

  on the union pacific the cost had
been reduced to less than one-fifth of
what it was ten years ago on six roads
the cost was reduced over seventy per
cent on fifteen others from fifty to sev-
enty per cent and on twenty others from
thirty to fifty per cent during the same
period every other department of rail-
road operation showed an increase in
cost

no -is it any wonder that railroad men dont make good
farmers jake z planted canned tomatoes and they
came up just plain hay-fever

      as a rule
      a mans a fool

      when its hot
      he wants it cool

      when its cool
      he wants it hot

      always wanting what is not

      not content with what hes got

here are forty - two more
  verses of this epic poem
  but that is probably forty-
  two more than the editor
  will stand for as emer-
  son would not say in the
  terse and expressive lingo of new eng-
  land 

   this will hold us for a while

  now will the reader kindly read
those eight lines again and ponder it
is not often he will find anything in these
chronicles to give him ponder better
read them three times

  what brought this illuminating stanza
to the fore was this

  a few days ago i went to chicago to
see for myself if the masonic temple
does turn on its axis every few hours
and to find out for true if it could act-
ually be bought by an outsider for 
cash in hand if the outsider would ap-
pear on the spot carrying a canvas tele-
scope and gaze long and patiently at the
twenty-third story until lie was run over
by a cab

  on the way to chicago conductor
james sat with me and we had converse
about many things james has- one of

our choice runs - short hours a long
time at home and a nice salary every
freightman on the road looks on jamess
run with covetous eyes and figures the
year when he will land it

  i told james in my opinion he had
the best thing a railroad had to offer a
man below the rank of high panjan-
drum 

  james dissented

   every one thinks said he  run-
ning a passenger-train is such a snap
but ill tell you if i had money enough
to buy a good farm id quit em to-
morrow

   you are right james i said con-
solingly  its a cruel fate that com-
pels man to go up and down the aisle
of this twenty - thousand - dollar coach
punching tickets handing out informa-
tion and good cheer when he might be
chasing an insurgent calf over a twenty-
acre lot or milking ten cows or turning
the mules into the wood pasture or car-
rying slop to the poland chinas

its mere popofl

                             i

  all the same persisted janies its
the most independent life

  a man hears that expression so often
among railroaders that if he isnt vac-
cinated he may believe it it is only
idle tnik - mere pop off-the present
yearning for what is not

   james said i  you wouldnt stay

scries began in the july  r a i  r o a d mans magazine single copies  centi

j


the railroad mans magazine

on a farm ten days you would come
crawling back you would watch a
crossing or you would carry water to
a construction gang before you would
stay away from a railroad then i
quoted him that forceful rime

            as a rule

            a mans a fool

  better go back and read them again
why the farm for railroad men i
never heard of an engineer wanting to
quit the road to run an engine in a flour-
mill i never knew of a conductor anx-
ious to break away and own a shoe-store
it is not a common thing for even a rail-
road clerk to voluntarily sever his con-
nection and become a clerk in a private
enterprise wherefore - why this hun-
ger for agriculture

  after thinking so hard for an answer
that i couldnot sleep at night i wrote
the international psychological research
association of oxford which in due
time submitted this explanation 

   instinct of primordial man why
  does man recoil at the sight of a snake
  why does man have an innate horror
  of falling from a high place be-
  cause he lived ten thousand years or
  more in trees and in cliffs to avoid
  the ravages of wild beasts but he was
  all the while beset with two dangers
  namely snakes and falling we have
  not yet outgrown the impress of fear
  thus made by and by man learned to
  vary his raw-game diet with vegetables
  then for ten thousand years he dili-
  gently cultivated carrots and that too
  left its impress on posterity thus
  skipping the evolutionary generations
  and coming with one bound to the
  period of grasshopper engines and all
  steel hoppers we find railroad men in
  common with all men recoiling at the
  snake in horror of a fall and with a
  wild impulse toward a truck-patch

  clever explanation isnt it scien-
tific too shows that we inherit it-
just like freckles red hair and other
malformations

         just one crop 

  generally speaking the dream of a
railroad man is of a small farm and
there is but one crop-chickens

  many a railroad man has forgotten to
throw a derail or close a switch because
he was figuring if one hen laid seven
eggs in one week how many eggs would
three hundred hens lay in one year

  then if it only cost one cent per day
to keep one hen and eggs retailed from
twenty-five to thirty cents per dozen the
year round and dressed poultry is worth
thir-ty cents per pound how long would
it take him on forty acres of ground to
have enough money to buy the control-
ling interest in the railroad so that he
could fire the present management

  about that time the train backs up
and the caboose goes off on the ties and
theres such a muss that he forgets the
answer

  jake z- a friend of mine-twenty

years a freight conductor and just now
wearing the epaulets of blue and gold-
had the fever of the soil many years

  jakes fad was tomatoes tomatoes
enter largely in the diet of a freight-
train crew they come canned and are
a convenient vegetable

likes them any style

  it must be remembered that there is an
infinite amount of cooking done on the
caboose stove but there are not many
gastronomic surprises the menu is
boiled pork and beans occasionally a
can of tomatoes adds variety to the
relish

  jake doted on tomatoes he liked
them sliced spiced or iced he took them
baked deviled fried scalloped stewed
or stuffed whenever jake thought of a
farm or garden-patch the mental per-
spective was always one of tomato-vines
in endless profusion and red and yel-
low tomatoes hanging pendant thereon
in countless numbers

  with all the rest of us jake thought
that by and by he would own a small
farm he made up his mind to strike
out on original lines he reasoned it
out the tomato was the finest vegeta-
ble known to man when people actual-
ly found out how succulent and appe-
tizing it really is the demand was bound
to be enormous

  jake would get in early on tomato cul-
ture  and when the people began clamor-
ing and fighting for tomatoes he would
observations of a country station-agent



have them for sale - baskets wagon-
loads car-loads and train-loads - each
and every one of em with jakes private
dutch coat-of-arms blown on the skin
as a trade-mark

ready to plant

jake went at it systematically and sci-
entifically he talked knowingly of

in the following spring lie received
twelve tomato-plants from the old gar-
dener-all that could be spared jake
guarded them as if they were jewels in
the crown of the gaikwar of baroda

  he decided not to set out the plants on
his patch of ground as lie would only
be able to see them once a week he hit
upon a happy idea

  every other day on his run his train

do you know anything about tomatoes asked jake

potash phosphoric acid nitrogen and
other soil properties

  good luck attended him in the ful-
ness of his enthusiasm he ran across an
old gardener who by some strange and
unexplained freak of nature had devel-
oped a new variety of tomato-firmer
hardier and more abundant than any-
thing heretofore known

   burbank may have turned a few
tricks with the potato and the cactus but
well show em something on tomato cul-
ture thatll cause uncle jim wilson to
sit up and rub his eyes said jake
 well play andrew carnegies research
commission for the usual award of
 per to enable us to continue our
investigation and experiments for the
perfect tomato which will take the place
of bread and meat

  that winter jake bought on long in-
stalments a twenty-acre tract of land

stopped one mile east of k-- and the

engine went  to the station and did
the station switching usually consuming
one hour in the work jake always re-
mained behind in the caboose until the
work was done and the train pulled up
to the station it occurred to him that
that particular spot  the right of way
was the ideal place for the first years
culture of the new tomato-which he
had decided should bear this name
 z-s bountiful

a real rube

  he prepared the soil over by the fence
and set out the plants with great care

  the section foreman agreed to look
after them and protect them

  jake told the boys in the office at the
depot about his experimental station
because he was full of it and it is not
the railroad mans magazine

human nature to remain quiet when in-
terest is at the effervescent-point

  every other day he worked and
watched at the little patch he sought
counsel of experienced gardeners and
he loosened the earth and coaxed them
along with all the vigilance and industry
possible

grew like pine-trees



  with all his care he was dismayed
one morning to find them stringy and
wilted for a time it was a question il
they would live but constant attendance
and the summer sun brought them out
and they put out new leaves and pushed
themselves upward

  now the original tomato is a vine
that falls sprawling to the ground and

requires a support to enable it to round
and ripen its fruit

   z-s bountiful  went straight up

like a pine-tree it had a hardy stalk
a fine bush and would evidently hold a
peck of fruit without a prop that
alone would make it famous but add
to that the additional yield and the finest

quality and the possibilities of  z-s

bountiful  were indeed beyond calcula-
tion

  as the season advanced other garden
and truck patches along the road showed
tomatoes in bloom but the new variety
steadily refused to give a hint

  it began to give jake some concern
his wife overheard him saying in his
sleep one night  theyre settin on all
right hurrah theyre settin on i
can see em ten-fifty-one hundred
-ten thousand - one mil-
-on one stem  
jake exclaimed his
wife poking him in the
ribs  what on earths the
matter  

    matter nothin grunt-
ed j ake  i was just drearn-
iii we had a head-on colli-
sion and killed a million
people dont bother me
on the next trip out jake
had as a passenger a farmer
in charge of a car-load of
emigrant movables his car
was next to the caboose

  do you know anything
about tomatoes asked
jake

   ive raised em every
year for twenty years for
the pokeville cannery i
reckon i know em about
as well as any man in pike
county replied the farmer

   when we stop up here
a few miles said jake  i
wish you would get off and
look at some tomatoes i am
raising on the right of way
its a new variety-just dis-
covered-and its bound to
revolutionize the tomato in-
dustry of the country i
expect to get seed enough
from the twelve plants to
put out twenty acres next

 lion

its hay-fever thats all just hay-fever

i
observations of a country station-agent 

 year after that ill offer plants for sale
 ill get my own price for em too

the farmer manifested a lively in-
terest

 they got off together and looked over
 the patch

plain hay-fever

   dont seem to be any bloom said
the farmer

   thats one thing i
dont like they do seem
a little slow replied jake

   you never farmed any
did you   asked the
farmer somewhat ab-
ruptly

   ive read a good
deal said jake  
always thought id like
it

   who told you them
was tomatoes

   why theyre a new
variety

   some ones stung
you brother do you
know what kind of a
crop youre raisin  

   why of course-

you do eh well

ill tell you its hay-
fever thats all just
hay-fever why man thems nothing but
ragweed the orneriest plant that grows
and it aint any new variety either you
can get seed enough out of them plants
for twenty acres all right but if you
expect to get a lot of money out of them
youd better change your mind and rob
a bank raisn ragweed well durn
my buttons if that dont beat anything
ive ever heard of

jake did not tell his wife the particu-
lars when she questioned him about

 z-s bountiful he told her a tale

of robbery by envious and eager farmers
to beat him to an agricultural triumph

  the boys in the office continue to
question him almost eagerly about the
new variety he remains mum there
is a crisis in all development and in that
crucial period science shuts up like a
clam jake feigns the caution of a
weighty secret and lets it gb at that
he doesnt repeat what the farmer told

howl that would have done credit to an
      indian massacre

him but the experimental patch is bare
of its crop no one seems to know and
all the office force is curious

cant beat sherlock

  sherlock holmes would note this
pressing curiosity of the office force and
after poising a tomato in one hand and
snuffing a twig of ragweed would de-
duct something like this

   substitution of plants was made
after planting you will remember
plants thrived at first then wilted then
revived the lycopersicum esculentum
or tomato was removed at that time and
the senecia jacoboca or ragwort or so-
called ragweed was substituted this
was done by the office force hence
their curiosity and suppressed snickers
by looking over the back fence of the
garden of the chief clerk there will be
found twelve tomato-vines but they are
	the railroad

bearing only ordinary tomatoes how
do  know that because no railroad
man ever has great expectations that
come true

  you cant lose sherlock

  jake doesnt know to this day why
 z-s boun-
tiful  failed to
 bount but he
is now so -busy
with the interior
department get-
ting information
about irrigated
land of the great
west that there
is no use to stop
him and tell him

  twenty years
ago trains were
not provided with
air as they are
to-day when
a train running
along broke in
two there was
no way to know
of it unless the
engineer or fire-
man chanced to
look back and
notice that the
tail end was not
in sight it was
then up to the
engineer to keep
going lest the
rear should bump
into him w i t h
disastrous results

it was considered rank carelessness for
the engineer to permit a smash-up of
this kind and he was vigorously dis-
ciplined for it

  one very dark night bill hart was
pulling a freight-train on the branch to
madison he was creeping noiselessly
upon a small hamlet and came to a stop
bill knew there was no other train on
the division both he and the fireman
took a sack and got off and disappeared
in the darkness the head brakeman
had twisted a few brakes and had just
crawled down onto the tender when
there came a rumble of wheels and a
smash

  the brakeman went over the breast-

mans magazine

works on his head and shoulders he
came out of it with a few bruises
and dislocations the train had parted
and run together five cars were badly
smashed

  why had bill stopped  echo asks why 

  bill and the
fireman saw they
were in for it at
a glance they
held a hasty con-
sultation with the
brakeman w h o
was on his feet
by this time with
the result that he
made a wide de-
tour through a
field and came
out on the track
again a short dis-
tance behind the
caboose here
he rolled over in
the ditch and
set up a howl
that would have
done credit to an
indian massacre
they found him
there and helped
him into the ca-
boose

  it all came out
in the inves-
tigation t li e
brakeman fell off
the engine the
engineer kne w
the train was
parted would he stop and go back to
the assistance and perhaps save the life
of the brakeman or would he go on to
keep out of the way of the rear end

  the human impulse to save a life pre-
vailed he stopped they at once
came together disaster tableau
bill posing as hero

  bill got out of it that way and in one
week was back on his run

  he was asked if by making possible
a wreck had it not occurred to him that
he was endangering the lives of the men
on the caboose to render doubtful service
to the brakeman who had fallen off

   all i thought of bill answered
 was that poor fellow that fell off
observations of a country station-agent 

  so it passed as one of those rare and
strange incidents-one of those freakish
combinations-that now and then occur
in railroading to wreck trains or take
human life

to admonish them to play the game safe-
ly and for small profits on corn cabbage
or cucumbers and leave the  wonders 
to be worked out by real farmers 

 why should a railroad man be a

 of course the whole thing was acted farmer anyway can a farmer come
 out and recited to save bills job since  up out of the alfalfa and run a train

that much is kfiown the question sug-
gests itself why did bill stop

  that brings me back to the railroad
man and the farm once more

  bill wanted to be a farmer and he
had a fad no tomatoes for him his
was jersey pigs bill read all the liter-
ature extant on jersey pigs he had
two cows and a pasture-lot and he fig-
ured that a vast brood of jersey pigs
could roam therein wax fat and multi-
ply and add many doubloons to his an-
nual income

  one day he noticed quite a litter of
jersey piglets in a pen adjoining the
right of way fence they were frisky
rugged little fellows a few nights
later he came crawling up
to the spot with a convenient
bag and proceeded to gath-
er in about six of them
when-smash

  but bill never wavered
from his purpose it is
true that he lied about the
accident and it is true he
was about to steal when it
occurred he came along
softly a month later but he
was sure of the tail-lights
before he stopped then
he went over and got two
pigs he did not take six
because they had grown so
that two were all he could
handle

  he combined them with
other pigs he had secured
by various processes  by
and by when pork reached
the fancy figure of ten dol-
lars per cwt and bill was
prospecting on the profits
the cholera laid its heavy
hand on the collection and
took them all

  these stories of disaster
are related to solemnly fore-
warn all railroad men
against agricultural fads

lay a track or conduct a railroad office
by the same token can we wipe the ink
off our pen and go out and run a farm

  we cant do it brothers we cant
do it

  farming is a scientific game one
must be born to it and learn it by the
hard rule of experience

  if you have too much money ask the
management to reduce your salary it
will be done cheerfully

synopsis of previous chapters

larry smith and jack marly being in possession of some valuable water-rights
j are building a dam smith being the engineer and marly supplying half the
capital the other half of the capital is supplied by a denver capitalist named briggs
and another man named garth briggs comes to view the work and while there he drops
half of a broken shilling which marly picks up the capitalist is interested as a
money-lender and not as a partner and he holds a mortgage on the dam and all the
rights subject to a time-limit for the completion of the work

    jack linds that garth briggs and murdock the contractor are playing a double-
cross oil larry and himself a walking-delegate tries to organize the men and jack
orders him off the place it is evident that he is paid by briggs there is a scrimmage
iu which the walking-delegate loses considerable dignity and some skin

chapter vii

rumors

kare sat heavily on jack and
  larry that evening they
  smoked in silence on the
  bench at the front of the
  shack until mrs larry-
  who could tell without eyes
  that something was wrong-rallied them
  on their glumness

  at that moment jack happened to be
thinking how much worse off he was than
larry because larry had won a splendid
wife and larry had a profession which
would always assure his freedom from
poverty even if mrs larry should man-
age to lose her fortune-which as jack
had gathered from talk at the table was
safely invested in bonds

  as for himself  he was a vagabond
who had been unlucky enough to have
money and now it seemed was about
to be unlucky enough to lose it

   are you two men owls  mrs larry
was inquiring

 i dont wonder you think so mary

began in the octobei railroad mans



 replied larry with an attempt at a laugh
  come and join us

she seated herself beside larry and
jack did not turn his head for it would
emphasize his own feeling of loneliness
if he saw that her hand was in larrys

  it wjll do you good she said with
 fine seriousness  to tell me all about it
 tack moved uneasily

  i can guess this much she went 
  its mr garth you have discovered
 that he is not genuine

you know that larry turned to
her in surprise

 yes i had a good view of him the
other day when you were taking him and
mr briggs over the work

 but what makes you think he isnt
genuine mary

  i cant tell you what made me think
 so i just knew it

and mr briggs

  he is all selfish

  larry sighed  it looks he said
  as though you had seen in a flash what
 jack and i believed only when evidence
 convinced us

 in addition remarked mrs larry

 magazine single copies  cents
the dam-builders



 there is something that wing fah tried
to tell me perhaps you would under-
stand him

  what did you make of it dear
larry was quite aroused

   you remember he went to the city
the day mr garth brought mr briggs
up well on his way back he seems to
have met them and something was said
or done-

   come jack well see what wing
fah has to say

  larry rose abruptly but he paused to
lay his hand gently on his wifes shoul-
der  i dont want you to be worried
mary dear he whispered  those
men shant beat us

  she smiled her loving confidence

   wing fah began larry  you sabe
mr garth

   me sabe replied wing fah

   the missis says you saw him the
other day  

   fat-belly man in bluggy said wing
fah  thlin-belly man too hoss talc
a dlink at blook-assagcment of thlust
 what did they say 

   thlin-belly-top-side bluggy-say 
 fleeze em out fleeze em out make
steike  

  larry looked at jack then said again
to wing fah

   did you sabe what he meant 

   no sabe fat-belly say  glet away
damn chinaman-so pie illustrated
what garth had done to him by kicking
out with his right foot  me agglavated
by pang he rubbed his leg ruefully
 sabe me lun away

  larry nodded and he and jack left
the kitchen

  could you understand it asked
mrs larry

   he overheard briggs say something
about  freezing us out explained larry
 thats the danger dear

   dont think about it now she said
 either of you take me for a walk in-
stead i have not been away from the
shack to-day

  so they strolled alongthe mountain-
side the three of them and drew peace
from quiet converse and the companion-
ship of the night sky and the dim masses
of the friendly peaks

  the next morning the work went on
as usual down on the pipe-line as

jones and armsby reported the men
were actually driving ahead at the
dam the last sluice was being constructed
and the installation of machinery in the
power - house was proceeding satisfac-
torily

  in the sparkling sunlight jack felt his
depression evaporate as for larry he
was coolly and methodically busy using
every means of hurrying murdock with-
out seeming to hurry him

  later in the day jack yielded to his
desire to ride to  sweden thekla
wist persistently came before the eyes
of his memory even when the problems
of the work were most absorbing her
presence seemed to be hovering near

  he could not understand why this
should be so she was a mysterious vis-
ion of beauty flowering unexpectedly in
that meadow in the mountains but he
had seen her only the one time and he
knew no more of her than what she ap-
peared to be some unaccountable shy-
ness had kept him from making inquiries
about her

  when he came to the bridge that
crossed the little stream he saw that his
 message  had disappeared-the flowers
and note and handkerchief he dis-
mounted and walked up the stream to
the place where he had left them to
make sure that they had not blown away

  the stones with which he had weight-
ed them down were swept together in a
little heap going back to his pony he
searched the landscape for a sight of her
but he searched in vain

  this day however he had no mind
to go away without seeing her and mus-
tering his courage-it impressed him as
odd that the act should require courage
-he rode on toward her fathers house

  in a distant field he had a glimpse of
men mowing but when he came to the
house no one was in sight he waited
in the road hoping that she might see
him and come out

  in the yard a hammock swung be-
tween two trees and a book lay on a
chair beside it her book no doubt
and in the hammock she might have lain
reading

  but though it seemed to him as if she
must have left the place only an instant
before the house-door did not open and
no face appeared at the windows


the railroad mans magazine

  at last he dismounted and walking
to the door knocked he must at least
ask for her the noise of his summons
echoed emptily from the hall within and
 steps came to open to him the place
suddenly oppressed him with that lone-
liness which one feels so much the more
overwhelmingly when there are signs of
recent human presence but  person to
account for them

  again he knocked there seemed to
be  one within sound reluctantly he
returned to llis pony and again in the
saddle looked back once more to the un-
responsive house half expecting a late
recognition

  she might be sleeping-or ill the
restless pony put an end to his linger-
ing by starting forward with  urging
of the spur and though he found him-
self headed toward the heart of the val-
ley he did not check the animal nor
turn him about onward the pony car-
ried him farther and farther from the
bendwater

  ahead was another farmhouse as lie
approached it some one came out and
started down the road toward him he
knew her at once by the golden gleam
of her hair by the untrammeled manner
of her walk it was thekla as lie got
nearer to her he saw that she was carry-
ing a black hand-bag

  he waved his hat happily and getting
down from the pony led the animal
meeting her  foot she smiled with
frank pleasure and took his extended
hand

   little christine peterman found
your note she began  she brought it
to me with the flowers and the handker-
chief thank you for your thoughtful-
ness

   i am glad you felt no after-effects
from your fall

   it was nothing even the bump is
gone see  she turned her head and
parted the heavy coils of hair for his in-
spection

   i planned to ride up yesterday he
went on  but i couldnt get away

  she smiled faintly  you would not
have found me little christines mother
has been very ill and i have had to be
with her nearly all the time

   then you are a nurse as well as a
valkvr 	

   i  behold  laughingly she held
the hand-bag before his eyes

   you mystify me said jack

   i have  wish to mystify you mr
marly i am the doctor 

  the doctor

  she nodded

    but  dont understand there are
so many things i dont understand about
you

   i am a regular md she said
quietly  my father led these people to
this valley some years ago from minne-
sota i stayed behind with some rela-
tives-my uncle who is a banker at
minneapolis-for i was studying at the
university of minnesota

   after graduation i went to chicago
and took a course in medicine and sur-
gery i spent a year in a chicago hos-
pital then my father sent for me

   and you buried yourself here

   it is my fathers home she spoke
gravely  he is growing old he has
had many disappointments in his life
i should not like to be his last great
disappointment

  jack was silent

   he spent several years in the west
long ago she went on after a pause
 then he came back to minnesota and
married my mother and went to farm-
ing  think he is less moody now less
bitter than he used to be

   i used to be afraid of doctors re-
marked jack there was one who
looked after the football squad he
caught me smoking a cigarette once -
he smiled at the memory- but there
cant be so many cases here that you are
kept busy professionally 

   only now and then

   why not have a gallop with me
then  you ride of course  

   yes i ride but i have  good
saddle-pony they are more interested
in work-horses up here

 if i were to bring an extra pony-
 that would be splendid she sighed
 i will come for you to-morrow
he took hold of the broken shilling in
his pocket hoping that its lucky magic
would help him to get her consent

   hardly to-morrow

   why not  he asked boldly

   mrs peterman is not out of danger
yet
the dam-builders



   then the next day 

   very well the next clay-and thank
you

  they had now come to her house  if
you will wait  will get your handker-
chief she said

   of course i will wait-as long as
you will let me but you neednt bother
to return the handkerchief

   oh but i must she tripped lightly
to the house and returned in a moment
with the square of colored fabric he
had hoped that she would keep it he
would like to have her possess something
of his

   i knocked at the door as i came
along he explained  but  could get
no answer

  no one is at home except my aunt
she is very deaf

  your father is out in the fields

   yes and that reminds me mr mar-
ly i am glad to have seen you to-day
there is t story in circulation that your
company secretly intends to flood this
valley i think you ought to know
to flood this valley absurd

   yes i know it is absurd and i have
told them so nevertheless the story is
believed my father believes it

   but who could have said-

   it came through some norwegians
at larkin city they profess to have
heard it from some of your workmen
the dam is being built so high they say
that the water will back up and cover
all this land

  why-

   your company is supposed to have
planned it in such a way that the flood-
ing will drive us all out and leave us no
recourse but lawsuits you are supposed
to have so much money that we shall
stand no chance in the courts

  jack was thoughtful   think he
said that if you dont mind i will
wait and have a talk with your father

   i doubt if it would do much good
just now my people are stubborn mr
marly when theyonce get an idea into
their head it is not easy to get it out and
you cannot possibly convince them by
direct argument

   nevertheless-

  if you will only say nothing about
it and leave it to me t believe i can
make my father see after a few days

     r r

   but if i were to offer to show him
our plans 

   he would be more suspicious than
ever he would say that it is very easy
to deceive with lines and figures

  you prefer that i shouldnt then
 it would do more harm than good
i wished you to know of it but  do-not
wish it to worry you

  she was very earnest and very lovely
and underneath her charm was a note of
sound common sense he was almost
tempted to tell her of the difficulty in
which larry and he had foiud them-
selves but he remembered in time that
that was as much larrys secret as his
own and larry for all he knew was
not even aware that such a girl as thekla
wist was in existence but he said

   have you ever been to the dam 
she nodded  i have been in sight of
it more than once with my father but i
have never gone quite all the way and
it is some months since i have been out
of this valley

  how lonely she must have been

   you know that used to be our route
to larkin city

   you speak like the oldest inhabi-
tant he laughed

    and in fact  have been here less
than a year

   well some day before long i am
going to take you down to the work and
show it to you properly

  she looked doubtful

   you will like mrs- smith he has-
tened to add  her husband is the
chief engineer he and i are in the
thing together

   then you are one of the engineers 
 nothing quite so busy as that but
will you come

   perhaps isnt it enough that i
promise to ride the day after to-mor-
row 

   just what you wish to do is enough
he said  i shall be on hand with a
pony for you meantime -he frowned
a little- i am a bit troubled by that
rumor you speak of are you certain
that larry smith and i hadnt better do
something about it 

   quite certain you would probably
make things worse  am sure that i can
manage it

   but-


the railroad mans magazine

   you dont realize how deeply rooted
their suspicion of the company is it
has been growing for two years so please
do not even tell mr smith your chief
engineer

  jack yielded there was nothing else
for him to do but his doubts recurred
when on the road back to bendwater
canon he was halted by a burly middle-
aged norwegian who said to him in
broken english

   you must not come here again
  why not asked jack coolly

   we know why you come you must
stay away

   i come to see miss thekla wist
no-no we understand why you
come

   and i shall visit miss wist again
jack continued

  the man shook his head and began to
jabber in his native tongue and jack
rode on all the way to camp he won-
dered about this strange suspicion among
the norwegians could it be traced
back to the brain of thomas brigg it
would be easy for him to pay one of the
workmen at the dam to carry the false
story to the norwegians of larkin city

  when he went to the home of thekla
wist on the second afternoon following
leading an extra pony he was prepared
to find his progress disputed but he met
no one the girl was waiting for him

chapter viii
the beginning of dreams

t ets make a circuit of the valley
- among the foot-hills he sug-
gested and at her assent they went back
to the limit of cultivated ground and
struck off to the left

  the soil was firm and the slopes were
easy thekla rode to perfection with
corselet helm and spear she might well
have passed for the valkyr his fancy had
first painted her her face was alight
with the joy of the bounding gallop tier
red lips parted above her white teeth
and her blue eyes shone

  at their left the hills billowed up to
the peaks below at fne right was the
well-watered valley with its fields shim-
mering in the breeze after a time they
slowed their ponies to a walk

  how are your patients asked
j ack

   doing well-thanks 

  and the other matter

  she was ready for the question in-
deed she may have guessed how close to
the tip of his tongue it had been lying

   i am progressing slowly it takes
time to convince my father once-
many years ago-he trusted a man too
much  and since then he has seemed to
trust no one

  jack hesitated a fellow stopped
me on my way home the other day and
warned me to keep out of the valley
she reined in abruptly  what did
he look like

  he was say forty-strong looking
with peculiarly long arms he had a
straggling red beard and bushy red eye-
brows

   that was ole knudsen she shud-
dered as she spoke the name  how
did you answer him

  he told her and she looked thought-
ful jack became aware that conflicting
issues centered in the man though for
the time she said no more

  after they had nearly completed the
circle of the valley however she turned
her pony abruptly down toward a field
where a man was cultivating potatoes

   come she said to jack and he
followed

  the man stopped his machine as they
came near riding carefully between the
rows it was knudsen he glared at
jack but his eyes softened when he
turned to thekla

  she addressed him sharply in norse
he answered little but jack could see
the look on his face range from admira-
tion to distrust and from distrust to a
sullen submission at her signal jack
swung his pony around and they rode
out of the field

   i dont think he will bother you
again she said  but he is a hard man
to deal with then in a tone of em-
barrassed frankness she added   he is
a widower with six children

  jack understood that creature of
the soil had desired this goddess

  it was as she had said he saw no
more of knudsen though almost daily
he came to the valley but thekla he
saw again and again and soon it was
the dam-builders



 thekla  and jack when they spoke
to each other and they were telling
each other freely of their past lives and
voicing their future hopes and aims

  he even one day confessed tu her his
follies-how he had squandered a fifth
of his fortune - and he knew that the
lack of reproof in her sympathy was due
to her knowledge that such follies were
with him all of the past her fine
comradeship would of itself have been
his salvation

  he could not induce her however to
visit the dam whether it was shyness
that made her refuse or whether she did
not wish to go alone with him so far out
of sight of her own home her pretty ob-
stinacy was persistent

  one day when she spoke to him of
her life in chicago-of people she had
known there of the books and the music
that she had enjoyed - he caught the
note of wistful yearning in her voice
 thekla he said abruptly  you have
been lonely here

  she bent her head a little

   you have sacrificed yourself to lie
with your father-to deal out pills to
these farmers you have cut yourself
off from the worthy things you had
learned to enjoy and you are facing a
monotonous future you know it

  still she was silent they had fin-
ished their ride and were standing in
the road before her house she turned
away from him and stroked the warm
neck of her pony

   it isnt fair to you he went on
hotly  your father ought to see it
there is so much in life for you that-

  dont she turned suddenly and
he saw that she was crying  i am the
tragedy of the second generation she
said  they have taught us to know
more than our fathers-to see more-to
enjoy more-and yet we are held back
by the old bonds of family relationship

   i have known it for years-that i
was having my glimpse of the promised
land only to be drawn back into the
arid desert of a life like this but it
has to be my father is my father
there is work for me here there is no
escape

  he tried to take her hand but she
motioned him away

   why didnt they bring me lip as

they are bringing up christine peter-
man she exclaimed fiercely then
i should have been at least contented
but now i am forced to look at the
ignorance of the very father i love-
and know it to be ignorance

   do you think it has been no shame
to me that he should believe that stupid
story about the dam cant you under-
stand why i have kept you from meet-
ing him it was because i was ashamed
of him ashamed of my father  she
burst into a torrent of tears

   thekla dear-

  you shant pity me you shant
 but thekla there is no shame in
a life that has lacked opportunity

    know it i have tried every day
to keep that thought in my mind but i
had no happiness here until you came
j-ack you were something from the
life i had left behind

   but i hope to be something of the
life you are going to live he said so-
berly  do you think i would look
down  your father thekla

   there is shame to me in my history
of wasted opportunities but he - at
least lie has made things grow and he
has shown himself a leader men
obey him i shall honor your father
thekla

   this is foolish of me  she ex-
claimed of a sudden good-by
she darted away to the house and for
several days thereafter he came to the
valley in vain

chapter ix
the power of the king

tvi eantime the work on the bend-
water went steadily forward and
that in spite of innumerable unexpected
delays that reduced little by little the
safety margin of time larry and jack
could not prove that these petty delays
were wilful

  thus when a load of staves was upset
on the road up klingerman pass and
the needed staves were so scattered down
the slope that it took an hour to gather
them it was easy for the teamster to
point to a soft place in the trail again
when a boulder rolled down the moun-
tain and smashed a short section of com-


the railroad mans magazine

pleted pipe though jack climbed within
the hour to the place whence the boulder
had started he was unable to find any
human footprints

  all that jack and larry could do was
to be watchful every morning jack
nonchalantly patrolled the line of the
pipe appearing unexpectedly where the
different gangs were at work

  in the evenings he canvassed the sit-
uation with larry they had become
quite dogged about it and they tacitly
adopted the policy of ignoring the final
issue as far as they could and concen-
trating on each immediate problem as it
arose

  to get the pipe completed was the
first concern gradually this was ac-
complished by saturday the twenty-
third it was ready to carry water-as
the contract specified

  from the intake below the dam all
the six miles to its outlet basin on the
inner slope of klingerman pass it ex-
tended its serpentine length segmented
by nearly a million steel rods the last
sluice too was done and the manufac-
turers men in the power-house had com-
pleted the installation of the machinery

  during all the crowded days there
had been a thousand signs of coming
trouble murdocks men appeared to
be getting out of hand groups of them
who went down to larkin city  dif-
ferent evenings returned to camp bois-
terous and unruly waking the night with
yells and revolver-shots

  whisky found its way to the sleeping-
tents and there was more gambling than
formerly to everything that larry said
to murdock the contractor had one re-
ply

  he eould not prevent the men from
going down to the city after working
hours and the trouble was primarily due
to jacks handling of oneill the walk-
ing-delegate yet larry knew that mur-
dock despite his pretense of helplessness
could control the men if he chose to

  one evening a few days before the
pipe was completed jack went alone
down to the temporary camp at klinger-
man pass he found jones and armsby
at their tent much depressed

    listen to that will you  said jones
disgustedly after greetings had been ex-
changed

   that  was the sound of squabbling
argument from the long tent of the
workmen

    it gets worse every night continued
jones  the foremen dont half man-
age em the trouble is the men have
got the idea that bill murdock is afraid
of them darn it im beginning to
believe he is

  jack knew better but he said nothing
after a time however he strolled quiet-
ly over to the mens tent and entered

  the scene was not pleasant the odor
was worse and the jabber continued
growing louder with the ostentatious ef-
fort to ignore the presence of the visitor
one black-browed chap in particular
remarked in a loud voice to three others
who were shaking dice with him

   some people never knows their
places they gouges the poor man an
then comes an stares at em eh here
iu throw to them sixes he rattled
the dice-box again

  jack saw that he would get into trou-
ble if he remained with a last glance
at the frowzy groups he walked away
in the darkness outside he heard a man
say to another

   oneill told me last night that if
we- the rest was lost

  all about the camp it was unrest-
unrest oneill was making good his
promises still if the men-even with
their growing disorderliness - could be
kept to their tasks only a few days
longer all might end well

   let ever so little water be in the reser-
voir  the thirtieth let it be turned
into the turbines and set the big dynamos
in motion let the waste run through the
pipe down to the thirsty soil of mor-
mon valley-let these things be done
and thomas briggs by his written and
completely witnessed agreement would
have to renew the mortgage bonds
would be sold then and in time the mort-
gage would be paid and larry and
jack would hold their own with aaron
garth

   in the midst of this crisis it was mrs
larry who developed the strongest hope
her calmness was better medicine for
larrv and jack than any forced or hys-
terical good spirits

  she did not deny the menace of de-
feat  but her quiet insistence on the right
the d am-builders



made them feel that defeat would not
matter so much if only they did their
best and as much as they could they
still ignored the chances of defeat

  it was friday afternoon the day be-
fore the pipe was finished when jack
after two days in which he had been
closely tied to the camp felt justified
in riding up to  sweden he had
seen thekla but once since her out-
break and then only for a few minutes
and now his heart leaped at the pros-
pect of an hour with her for he was
taking the extra pony along and hoped
that she would ride

  when he reached the house and
knocked at the door however though
she answered at once and though she
did not conceal her pleasure in seeing
him she made no move to go and put
on her riding-habit but invited him in-
stead to a seat on the doorstep she
clasped her hands over her knees and
looked straight before her and said

   jack you mustnt come any more
he laughed did she think that he
could help coming her feeling he
inferred was due to a decision that his
friendship was disquieting that it made
her lot the harder by the contrast be-
tween the hours she passed in his com-
pany and the dreary monotony of her
life among her people

n well he would lift her out of that
notion he would show her that she
owed something to herself and perhaps
-he realized this fully for the first time
-that he himself- she was speaking
again

  i am serious she said your
visits have been misunderstood

  he interrupted hotly  i dont see
how-

   wait the suspicion has grown
that your rides about the valley have
been for the purpose of spying out the
land ole knudsen has made them be-
lieve it the worst is that they think
 am in league with you

   they believe that you have drawn
me to your view of the case or at least
that you have fooled me they sneer at
me now when i tell them that you are
not going to flood the valley even my
father has forbidden me to speak of the
subject to him

   i cant imagine such a thing

   it is true you dont understand
my people jack suspicion is their
great weakness since they have seen
you and me together all that i can say
counts for nothing so you must keep
away i ask it for their sake as well as
for yours 

  why for their sake

   because i do not wish them to be
driven to madness

  he laughed  not as bad as that 
 think for a minute what it means
to them they came here and found
this valley barren they bought it for
little they dug ditches and diverted
the streams and they have made the
desert bloom

   it has become home to them they
love it the fear that your company
may force them from their homes is
enough to drive them to anything

   but they can be made to see-

   only by patience their minds
have been thoroughly poisoned by false
rumors there is another reason why
they love this valley here they are
almost shut off from the world they
are in a way independent they gov-
ern themselves and they are let alone to
work out their own customs

   if they are driven from this valley
they will have to go where they would
probably come directly under the rule of
men whom they would not understand
and who would not understand them
this valley is a little monarchy and my
father is its king if he were to order
that a wrongdoer be tied to a post and
flogged it would be done

   has it been done  jack was
amazed	

   no but t have lived here long
enough to know that such an order
would be obeyed the people here
never call upon the law of the state
though they pay their tribute of taxes
they are indeed a law unto themselves
and they are well behaved too she
said this with some pride

  look at me said jack and when
she showed him the troubled depths of
her eyes he continued  i am going to
have a talk with your father

   no

  yes whatever i can say i must
say now i am going to tell you some-
thin that i havent told you before he-


the railroad mans magazine

cause it was not my secret alone unless
the work down there in the canon is
finished by the thirtieth larry smith
and i shall lose our shares in it

   another man-an interested man-
is trying to make delays so that we shant
get through on time do you under-
stand i am convinced that this story
about the flooding of the valley was
started by that man it is intended to
make trouble for us

  she stared at him nonplused

   more is at stake he added  than
you have realized there is no time for
patience the man who is behind this
rumor will force the issue-must force
it if he is to rob us-within a week
you say you cannot change the situation
at once then it can do no harm for
me to talk with your father where is
he now

   in the field at the back of the
barns she faltered

  he arose for a moment he smiled
down at her it seemed as though he
were about to speak again but at last
he reached down and took her hand
pressed it gently released it and walked
quickly around the corner of the house
she sat for a time as he had left her
then with a sigh she followed him

  peter wist looked up from his radish-
bed as jack approached he was a
rugged man of sixty-firm of mouth
sharp of eye time had plowed many
furrows on his face and the autumn of
life had touched his thick hair with
white frost

  how do you do said jack sober-
ly  my name is marly i am one of
the owners of the power-dam in bend-
water canon

  peter wist got slowly to his feet

  i understand jack went on that
you men up here think we are going to
flood your valley it is not true

   you say it is not true said wist
dryly his english was good though
made quaint by the trace of foreign ac-
cent

   i will prove that it is not true
come yourself down to the dam-bring
with you as many of your friends as you
choose-and mr smith and i will show
you all our drawings and specifications
you will then know just how high the
dam is to be built and you will find that

the water cannot possibly back up as far
as this valley

  wist made no answer

   isnt that a fair offer mr wist

   yes i suppose so said wist in-
differently

   we will also show you our title
from the state and you will see that we
have not filed for a head of water high
enough to make the flooding of this val-
ley possible

  it is easy to fool men with plans
and writings remarked wist  we
would not understand them

   then bring with you some lawyer
that you trust began jack eagerly

   we trust no lawyers

   but you have friends in larkin city
who would understand the maps and ex-
plain them to you

  wist shook his head

   we will do more than show you the
plans mr wist we will give you a
written agreement not to let our reser-
voir come within a mile of the head of
the canon

  jack was turning the broken shilling
in his pocket for he had come to have
a half-superstitious faith in its value
as a charm it seemed to have no virtue
in this case for wist merely shrugged
his shoulders

   what do you say jack smiled

   i say nothing i do not believe
you

   but i will prove-

   i do not want your proof  you have
been coming to spy  us many days
his eyes were beginning to light up with
the anger which he had until now kept
under control

   but you are mistaken said jack
eagerly  i have not come to spy i
have come to see thekla

  wist laughed scornfully  i under-
stand he said and his voice shook
 you would play with my daughter
while you spy you would rob me of
my home and of my daughter too

  it is false exclaimed jack and
at the same moment he heard an excla-
mation behind him and turned to see
thekla aghast  yes he continued
 it is false  

  wist had drawn himself up

  you say i lie he demanded
fiercely
the dam-builders



   i say you arc mistaken replied
jack you do not understand we
will not flood your fields we have
never thought of such a thing

   you say so remarked wist grimly
 and my daughter 

  and thekla- jacks voice broke
he looked at the girl and made an im-
pulsive gesture toward her but she
drew back  i have come to see
thekla he went on  because-be-
cause- again he turned to the girl
she was like stone

  wist was studying him with burning
eyes  so he shouted  it is what 
have said 

  it is not what you have said cried
jack it is what i say now  have
come to see thekla because i love her-
i wish her to be my wife

  there was a long silence peter wist
appeared to be stunned thekla clenched
her fingers so tightly against her palms
that her knuckles were white her
breast fluttered with her breathing
and jack-there was no trace of good-
natured indolence about him now his
face was transformed he was startled
but exalted by the revelation of his own
feelings for what he had said was
true-and he had not known it until that
moment

  at last wist spoke  she is not for
you what has she said  

  jack turned to thekla  come with
me dear leave this place come

  she shook her head her eyes were
wet her lips trembled at that mo-
ment she could not have spoken

  jack stepped nearer to her the
ponies are there he said in a low voice
 thekla i love you come with me
we will ride to the camp and i will put
you in the care of larrys wife

   i havent known it dear until now
i have only known that every day
seemed empty unless i saw you-that
you were always in my thoughts but
now  know it is because we belong to
each other you and t thekla dear
you care  oh you care  

  his arms were outstretched all of
love and devotion was his face and the
girl wavered with her too this was a
moment of self - revelation she shrank
from the glare of her own thoughts but

to be c

the compulsion of his feelings seemed to
drag her to him she raised her hand-
took an uncertain step

   thekla  peter wists rough voice
broke the spell the girl sighed
dropped her hand drew back

   thekla  - wists voice shook -
who is this man he pointed at
jack  how long have you known him
that you turn to him from your father
would you leave me for him he is a
robber you would be his toy

    i know his kind-smooth-smooth
i am your father he was stern ac-
cusing regal  i have given you your
chance to be what you are i have
worked for you-digging in the fields so
that your hands would be white do
you turn from me to him because his
hands are white 

 no no

  are you ashamed of me thekla

   no no  she sobbed

   if you go from me i shall think it
was because i had made you too good for
me-my daughter and if you go you
need not come back

  with a hurt cry she darted to her
father and buried her face in his coat
all the old reproach of her disloyal feel-
ing toward him and toward her home
swept over her with agonizing emphasis

  jack partly understood but only part-
ly his own immediate pain of loss was
too keen for him to see clearly

  he awaited the final blow

  wist glared at him sternly  go
away he said  go away and do not
come back

  jack stood his ground  i will do
what thekla wishes me to do look at
me thekla

  she shook her head

  thekla do you want me to go

  she was motionless her face still
pressed against her fathers coat

   thekla 

  he saw her fingers clutch more tightly
her fathers sleeve but she made no
sign and at last heavily he turned and
walked slowly away

  and strangely the impression that
remained with him was not the clinging
girl but the grim triumphant father-
still suspicious still embittered but more
a king than ever

 making passenger-
 cars comfortable

by c f carter

if running a railroad were as easy as the silly-season correspondents
imagine there would be no excuse for paying high-priced men and
conducting costly experiments to solve its problems as a matter of
fact the hurling of a maximum of weight at a maximum of speed and a
minimum of danger and discomfort across a continent involves difficulties
which the general public knows absolutely nothing about the difficulties
are as unending as travel itself and they progress with every step and line
of development

the aims efforts and difficulties of the men who must progress
with every luxurious wish and every danger
of the traveling public

full-grown travelers the length of the
sleeping-car berth-or rather the lack
of length-was adjusted some years ago
by the chicago milwaukee and st paul
railroad by the simple expedient of
building longer berths

  yet this is but one of the problems
connected with rolling-stock and in the
opinion of operating officials not the
most important one of the things that
promised a substantial reward to the in-
ventor was to find a way to provide all
the luxuries that are regarded by pam-
pered travelers of to-day as necessaries
at less than the heavy first cost of a
whole train of separate cafe dining par-
lor and sleeping cars for long runs and
light traffic and at less than the enor-
mous expense of maintaining and op-
erating such a train the problem has

series began in the august  railroad mans magaflne single copies  cents

                                         

            e difficulties of making a
railroad - train as comfort-
able as a hotel are obvious
when one takes into consid-
eration the limited space
but the public is a factor
that takes no account of difficulties and
if a miracle is required to produce z de-
sired result a miracle is demanded the
sleeping - car is a notable example
and the good and bad rimes and jokes
launched upon a defenseless world about
the limitations of this piece of rolling-
stock would fill many five-foot shelves

  railroad men have realized these lim-
itations too and have sought with the
same tireless zeal with which they have
grappled with the problems of the per-
manent way and motive-power to over-
come them the cardinal grievance of
making passenger

been solved by the american palace car
company by the building of a single car
which fulfils in itself all the functions
of a whole limited train several of
these cars are in use on the canadian
northern where they are giving satis-
faction

a disguised sleeper

  starting in daylight from port arthur
on its long journey into the northland
this new type of traveling palace appears
to be a parlor-car with observation and
smoking rooms and with twenty com-
fortable movable wicker chairs there
is nothing suggestive of the sleeping-
car about it

  at meal-time the porter who is also
waiter produces ten double tables from
mysterious closets which are spread with
a full service of linen china and silver
such as is to be found in the best dining-
cars and upon which are spread not a
buffet lunch but an appetizing course
dinner as served on the crack trains of
the trunk lines

  at bedtiitie the porter sets a couple of
chairs aside lifts up a trap-door and
begins turning a crank whereupon there
rises from the floor an upper and lower
berth longer and wider and higher than
the usual berth chairs and hand bag-
gage are stored in the cellar vacated by
the berths and the car is transformed
into a comfortable ten - section sleeper
for the night the windows are unusu-
ally high while the upper berths are
ventilated and lighted from the outside

an interurban luxury

  another sleeping - car which is dis-
guised as a parlor-car during the day is
the holland its chairs are fixed to the
floor and are folded down to form the
berth

  the chief novelties about the holland
car are that the berths are long that the
curtains are sliding wooden partitions
which make each berth a private com-
partment and that the fares are one-half
those on standard pullman sleepers
the first cars operated by the illinois
traction company between blooming-
ton illinois and st louis have been so
popular and profitable that the company
will place similar cars  other runs

cars comfortable	

  altogether it had been found easier
to please the passenger than to do some
other things for instance a difficulty
that is growing more serious every year
is to find suitable material from which
to build cars even if wood were satis-
factory which it is not it is getting so
scarce and so costly that other material
is necessary on the ground of economy
alone there are other and stronger
reasons

  the motive - power officials of the
harriman lines have recommended the
building of steel passenger-coaches ex-
periments conducted by them have de-
monstrated that the cost of maintaining
a steel coach is only half the cost of
maintaining a wooden one but the
safety of the steel car in wrecks and fires
is its strongest recommendation

  so far as the mere building of steel
cars is concerned that is easy the first
steel sleeping-car was exhibited by the
pullman company at the jamestown ex-
position and it has been undergoing a
trying out in regular service since then
the pennsylvania company in 
placed an order for two hundred all-
steel coaches they are to be built
strong enough to stand a roll down an
embankment without collapsing and to
stand an end blow of four hundred thou-
sand pounds while the end-wall frames
are to be so strong that the superstruc-
ture cannot be swept off in a collision

  thousands of steel gondolas have been
built and are in daily use to build
steel box cars would be an easy matter
as the union pacific shops proved by-
building the first two early in 
although of greater capacity than stand-
ard wooden cars they weighed but
 pounds compared with 
pounds

an experiment in iron

  indeed the baltimore and ohio proved
that it is forty-six years ago by building
two hundred box cars of one-eighth-inch
iron the tremendous progress made
since  in producing machinery for
the economical working of metal has
greatly simplified that problem when
the baltimore and ohio had built its iron
cars however its troubles were just
begun
	the railroad mans magazine

                                               

  using iron or steel cars is a very dif-
ferent matter from building them when
the summer sun beat down upon those
old iron cars the temperature in them
was almost high enough for baking
general merchandise or anything else
that was affected by a high temperature
could not be shipped in them

  they could not even be used for lime-
cars as they would sweat and ruin all
the lime the only thing for which they
could be used satisfactorily was scrap-
iron

heat in metal

  any one who has been in a railroad
yard full of steel gondolas in summer
need not be told that they have an enor-
mous capacity for absorbing heat on
a warm sunshiny day they are often too
hot to touch with the hand a steel roof
would greatly increase the inside tem-
perature it is claimed that the temper-
ature in an all-steel car on a summer day
would kill live stock and seriously dam-
age grain and a large variety of other
classes of freight

  in winter the changes of temperature
would cause deposits of moisture from
the atmosphere on the walls such as is
seen on locomotive-tanks and this would
cause serious damage to freight from
this it may be gathered that the problem
of the steel car is by no means so simple
as it might be

 he ease of theorizing

  the plain truth is that nothing about
a railroad is nearly so simple to the men
who operate it as to the outsiders who
know nothing about such matters take
the problem of safety appliances for in-
stance almost any plain citizen could
take his pen in hand and in half an hour
dash off a letter to his favorite news-
paper that would illuminate all details
of any question that could possibly come
up in the next decade

  vet mere railroad officials spend an
astonishingly large part of their time
considering safety devices without ma-
king any very rapid progress so many
inventions that work out to absolute per-
fection in patent specifications and draw-
ings and models that are infallible in

exhibition tests have a most unpleasant
habit of failing miserably in actual serv-
ice some of them prove to be downright
dangerous

  really it isnt surprising that railroad
managements do not spend more millions
on wondrous mechanisms guaranteed by
the inventor to work miracles when usu-
ally the inventors do not understand
even the most elementary facts about the
operation of such a simple piece of mech-
anism as a car-wheel

  it is simply amazing to discover how
many complications can arise from that
humble metal disk the problems as-
sume considerable magnitude when it is
remembered that nearly two and a half
million freight-cars in the united states
each have eight of these trouble-makers

the elusive car-wheel

  a great deal has been learned about
the car-wheel recently as a result of some
very curious and spectacular experiments

  previous to  little was known
about car-wheels except that they were
of few days and full of trouble for the
operating department

  when cars of  pounds capac-
ity were introduced the wheels lasted
only half as long as they had under the
cars of  pounds capacity it was
concluded that part of the trouble arose
from long continued and heavy pressure
of the air-brake shoes which heated the
wheels expanding the rims and thus re-
ducing their strength causing flanges to
break and ditch trains at most incon-
venient places yet this theory did not
cover the entire case

  experiments were begun by breaking
the flanges off of ordinary cast - iron
wheels in a testing - machine some of
them broke at pressure as low as 
pounds while the best gave way when a
pressure of  was applied steel
wheel flanges stood  pounds

  the next step was to ascertain if the
pressure on the flanges in going around
curves-the lateral thrust as it is called
-in actual service approached nearly
enough to the minimum strength of the
wheels as ascertained by the testing-ma-
chine to be dangerous the lateral
thrust is largely caused by the tendency
of the wheels to roll in a straight line
making passenger-cars comfortable



  in going around a curve the wheels
must slide laterally and also longitudi-
nally to an amount equal to the differ-
ence between the length of the outer and
inner rails the resistance of the trucks
which must be turned on the center plate
and side bearings to an angle with the
car body and then straightened back
again at the end of the curve also in-
creases the lateral thrust

flashlight measurements

  to settle this point a section three
feet long was cut out of the outer rail
on a curve of  feet radius on the
hickory branch of the pennsylvania
railroad and so arranged that it would
be held firmly in the track yet free to
move out enough to exert a pressure on
a hydraulic cylinder

  the measuring apparatus attached to
this section of the rail had to be heavy
enough to withstand the thrust of the
heaviest locomotive as it rounded the
curve at high speed yet so light that the
effect of the inertia of the moving parts
would not affect its operation it had to
be so sensitive and so rapid in action that
the pointer would register the thrust of
a passing wheel and get back to zero in
time to register the next

  that meant very quick action for the
wheel base of an ordinary freight-car
truck is five feet two inches and at a
speed of forty miles an hour the interval
between the two wheels would be eighty-
eight thousandths of a second

  the recording instrument was placed
on a table seven feet from the track and
connected with the hydraulic cylinder
by a brass pipe the speed of the pass-
ing cars in a train was registered at the
same instant as the lateral thrust by two
trips sixty-six feet apart which were ad-
justed to be struck by the journal-boxes

  at nine miles an hour the lateral
thrust of passing wheels  this curve
varied from  to  pounds at
twelve miles an hour  to 
pounds and at thirty miles an hour
 to  pounds at higher speeds
the pressure ran up to  pounds or
two-thirds the minimum strength of a
cast-iron wheel flange this was alto-
gether too small a factor of safety so it
was concluded that cast-iron wheels were

dangerous when placed under a modern
high-capacity car

centrifugal force

  that was pretty good for one lesson
but it was only a beginning in the study
of curve mechanics the railroad world
realized this when on february  
a new york central train of five cars
drawn by two electric locomotives in go-
ing around a three-degree curve with a
radius of  feet at woodlawn was
derailed - four of the coaches being
thrown over and partly destroyed kill-
ing twenty-four persons and injuring one
hundred the point was emphasized six
days later when the pennsylvania spe-
cial-the eighteen-hour train from new
york to chicago-was derailed on a
three-and-one-quarter-degree curve at
mineral point pennsylvania while run-
ning at fifty miles an hour

  the newspapers promptly announced
that the centrifugal force of the new
york central train in rounding the
curve threw it from the track but the
railroad engineers declined to accept this
theory they demonstrated that with
a superelevation of four and one-half
inches on a three-degree curve a speed
of one hundred and twenty miles an hour
was required to tip the train over

  they also pointed out that the acci-
dent at salisbury england was the only
one in many years caused by centrifugal
force as the train at salisbury rounded
a ten-degree curve with only three inches
superelevation at sixty miles an hour it
simply had to tip over

a newspaper race

  in order to find out what really was
the matter with track or equipment both
roads undertook a series of experiments
one point that interested both roads was
what difference if any there was between
a steam locomotive with its large drivers
and an electric locomotive with its short-
er wheel-base and smaller drivers in
rounding a curve

  for several days in october 
pennsylvania engineers stood near a lone-
ly curve near franklinville new jersey
watching a steam and an electric loco-
motive thunder past at speeds of sixty to


the railroad mans magazine

one hundred miles an hour the news-
papers concluded this was a new sort of
race-megt gotten up to determine which
could run the faster steam or electricity
and so gave long reports daily which
could not have failed to edify the sport-
ing fraternity as much as they did the
engineers

  the new york central experiments
showed that while a steam locomotive at
forty miles an hour exerted a lateral
thrust of  pounds in rounding the
experimental curve an electric locomo-
tive only registered  pounds at
sixty miles an hour the lateral thrust foi-
st earn was  pounds and for elec-
tricity  pounds at eighty miles
an hour the thrust was  pounds
for steam and  pounds for elec-
tricity

  by far the most elaborate experiments
ever made with a view to the solution of
problems connected with rolling - stock
was the series undertaken by the studien-
gesellschaft of germany assisted by the
ministry of public works the last of
which was held in  an experi-
mental track was laid from berlin to
zossen the department of public works
supplied the material and money and
soldiers were detailed to do the work

something in speed

  the studiengesellschaft had only to
conduct the experiments the object of
the test was to find out how the car and
its various parts acted at very high speeds
in order that defects might be remedied
and to study the resistance of the track
and the atmosphere and how best to
overcome them tests were made at va-
rious speeds up to one hundred and twen-
ty-four miles an hour

  the results strongly emphasized the
importance of careful design and good
construction for trucks of cars destined
to run at high speeds smooth running
was possible only when the load was
equally distributed on the axles

the second instalment of this article

  specially constructed swivel trucks of
longer wheel-base and wider lateral play
than ordinary were found to run more
smoothly at one hundred and twenty-four
miles an hour than the high-class cars on
through trains at one-half that speed a
sleeping-car with six wheel-trucks taken
from its regular run for the test began
to sway so dangerously at one hundred
and eleven miles an houj that the ex-
periment had tojje stopped

finding safety limits

  the danger - line in speed on curves
was found to be one hundred and thirty
miles an hour on entering a curve the
truck follows the rails while the car
body runs straight ahead until the ten-
sion of the springs becomes great enough
to overcome this tendency when the car
body swings over and runs smoothly

  the tendency of the front wheel of
the truck to climb the rail was so great
at extreme speeds that it was found
necessary to put guard-rails on tangents
as well as on curves

   an interesting point on which the first
authoritative data was collected at the
berlin-zossen sjjeed trials was the resist-
ance of the atmosphere of moving trains
his atmospheric resistance has always
i teen something of a bugaboo to the more
conservative while the other kind of
railroad engineers have not given it the
attention it deserves

the obstinate atmosphere

  the first serious attempt to deal with
atmospheric resistance in the united
states was made by f u adams a re-
porter on the chicago tribune who
eighteen years ago was sent to write up
a locomotive which the inventor claimed
by using a driving-wheel sixteen feet in
diameter running upon a single rail in-
stead of the customary two could make
the run between new york and chicago
in one hour

under the mellowing influence of the

   say pard was you ever initiated into
any of those secret societies whereyou

have you ever unconsciously acted like

farce to the initiated audience but a sort
of  your-money-or-your-life  experience
to your uncle monk

   nothing can spoil the pleasure of a
good smoke so lets have your yarn
ventured de bergerac

   this adventure happened in penn-
sylvania whither i had drifted after
blowing out of the sunflower state i
was holding down a job as extra man
in the office of the p and a r r not
a great distance from that section of the
country where the molly maguires had
flourished some years previous

   my duties consisted of doing any-
thing for which my abilities fitted me
and the superintendentfed me on such
a liberal diet of work that it was a won-
der i didnt contract indigestion in my
labor organization

   he ordered me one day to go to a
certain station up the road and secure
a package which had been expressed
earlier in the day and to deliver it to
its destination which i would learn
from the station-master owing to an
accident on the line i was unable to
get away until about  pm and then 
was compelled to take the freight and
ride in the tonneau of the caboose

   the funereal cortege landed me at
my station at about four-thirty and i
hurried to present my credentials to the
station-master as he looked them over

i imagined i saw a grin lurking in the
corners of his mug

   as it disappeared he said  i am to
deliver to you a package of money for
the semimonthly pay of the men up at
the lumber-camp which is situated on
the other side of a spur of the moun-
tain you have a good five-mile tramp
before you and should be able to reach
there about dark you simply have to
follow the road to and across the spur
which is shorter than going around

    there is no danger of going astray
if you keep your eyes open im glad
you have come to relieve me of the
money as i will feel easier with it off
my hands

    why theres no danger in this joy-
less paradise is there   i asked

    no not ordinarily he replied

 but word has come over the wire that
the sweeney boys have broken jail as
you know they are notorious outlaws
and they make these mountains their
headquarters

    gee  i commented  and heres
me carrying the coin to casey without
so much as a putty shooter to protect
the companys pay-roll you dont hap-
pen to have a blunderbuss handy that i
could borrow  

  no he answered i have not
but i have made up a dummy package
for you which may help you outwit any
one who may tackle you the genuine
package is sealed with red wax while
the dummy is sealed with black but
for that you couldnt tell them apart
 i handed him my grip and he
placed the two packages in it i
thanked him and was about starting off
after getting explicit directions when he
said

  by george i nearly forgot you
are to take this can of dynamite up to
casey he needs it to blast out tree
stumps to clear a wagon road so that
lie can haul his timber out

  he handed me a can - something
like a dinner-pail only smaller-painted
a bright red with the word  dynamite 
painted on it in white letters i didnt
like the idea of lugging that canned des-
truction along but the station - master
said casey had to have it

   i slung the strap of my grip over
my shoulder and started off carrying the
can by the handle and you can bet i
carried it carefully i knew that if i
dropped it pay-day for those wood-
choppers would be postponed and i
would be post-mortemed

   weighing my chances of being held
up  hiked along shortly the sky be-
came overcast and i knew that i was
in for a wetting unless i reached shel-
ter as i neared the mountain i heard
some one calling and on looking around
 saw a lad running toward me and beck-
oning for me to wait

   when he came up he asked me if
i was going to the lumber-camp and
if so would t take a letter to his father
who had gone over the day before

    assented and he gave me a letter
addressed to  bill jenkins sheriff 
hurried on being anxious to reach the
carrying the boodle to casey



shelter of the timber and in a short
time i reached the wooded slope and
started the ascent

   after proceeding a short distance i
beheld a cabin in the clearing to the
right and decided to investigate there
was no evidence of habitation so i
walked up and knocked there was no
response so i pushed open the door and
entered

   i found myself in an ordinary moun-
tain hut of one room with a large
open fireplace to one side suddenly i
discovered that the can of dynamite was
missing and i realized that i had put
it down while waiting for the lad to
overtake me and had forgotten to take
it up again

   there was nothing to do but retrace
my steps and secure the can i decided
to cache the grip and get it on my return
and found a good place up the chimney
hurrying back i found the can where
i had left it securing it i again made
for the hut and as i was about entering
i heard voices inside

   some one was evidently inside so
i cautiously peeped in two men were
kneeling on the floor with my grip be-
tween them one of them held an open
letter which he was reading and i
judged it was the one that had been
given me for delivery to the sheriff

    say tim he said this here
letter wont never be delivered to that
big galoot who put us away hell find
out soon enough that we have made our
getaway these packages look like they
has money in them so i guess wed bet-

ter fade away before the owner comes
along with a baggage-check and claims
his grip

  he can come and be blowed

this aint no claim office what hell
get will be plenty and it wont do him
no good if he comes moseying around
here growled the one called tim

   i stepped boldly into the room and
said  gentlemen

i fear you have
made a mistake i
happen to own that
grip you are
taking lib-
erties with
and i will
thank you
to hand it
over

they had
both jumped
up as i en-
tered and
as i finished
they looked
at each other
grinned

  say m i
says t im
wants this g r
he wont need
w hen we g
through with him
will he 

 with that they
both made a move
toward me but

raising the can of dynamite above my
head i said  if you two amateur high-
waymen dont want to shuffle off by the
dynamite route youd better be good
hand over that grip or ill make mixed
micks of you

     they stood hesitating while i
held the can aloft ready to throw it
at the first hostile move they made
outside the storm had broken and
the crashing of the thunder furnished
the fitting effect for our little drama
 i watched them closely and as they
both made a rush i hurled the can to
the ground jumping back through the
open door as i did so

   as it struck there was a flash and
a roar and the cabin collapsed when
i recovered consciousness it was dark
and the moon was shining through the
trees it was some time before i could
locate myself but gradually everything
came back to me

a stray dog had
hold of the package
which he had
evidently mistaken
for a rabbit


the railroad mans magazine

denouement to -my heroic stand i didnt
bother trying to find out why the dyna-
mite had not exploded but gathering
my paraphernalia i started afresh on
my interrupted journey

   the darkness and the solitude got
onto my nerves and i wondered whether
there were any more highwaymen wait-
ing for an easy mark after proceeding
some distance  stopped to make sure
the packages were all right and found
them undisturbed

    decided to adopt an extra precau-
tion for the safety of the package with
the red seal and taking a fishing-line
which i happened to have in my pocket

bite i tried to pull in but whatever it
was had nabbed my precious bait re-
fused to give an inch finally i tied
the loose end around a tree and followed
the line back to find out what i had
caught

   i found that a stray dog had hold
of the package which he had evidently
mistaken for a rabbit or something and
was trying to shake the life out of it
i tried to shoo him away but he
wouldnt shoo so losing patience i
soaked him on the head with the can
and laid him out

   then  realized that for the second
time that feminine gunpowder had

stand back or i will
blow the bunch
of you into
smithereens

    i arose and looked around the
 cabin was a wreck and  saw the out-
 laws pinned down beneath the heavy
 timbers i judged they were dead and
 started hunting for my grip thinking
 it might possibly have escaped destruc-
 tion i found it intact and the next
 thing i saw was that can of demolition
 powder smiling at me from amid the
 wreckage

 in my excited state i had thought
the dynamite had caused the wreck but
i now realized that an opportune hash
c of lightning had furnished the dramatic

 tied it around the package securely
then i took hold of the line by the end
and proceeded dragging the package
after me fifteen or twenty feet to the
rear

    calculated that if any one held
me up i could drop the end of the line
and the package would not be discovered

   i had proceeded about half a mile
in this way when suddenly i felt some-
thing tugging on my line just like a
carrying the boodle to casey



failed to make a demonstration when
provoked securing my package i
rolled the dog into a convenient gully
and proceeded as before trailing the
package like an innocent little lord
fauntleroy kid dragging a diminutive
red wagon

   but it seemed that i was doomed to
catch it from all sides for suddenly i
felt the other end of the line going up
into the air and my hair promptly did
the same

    whats the matter with this en-
chanted mountain   says i to myself as
 tried to draw in on the line

   it was just like flying a kite in a
high wind for whatever had hoid of
the other end fought hard but finally
i got the thing started and it came to-
ward me with a swoop when i realized
that i had been kite-flying an owl i
made a bat at it with that non-respon-
sive dynamite and it released its hold
and flew into a tree where it started
to make a noise like a locomotive in dis-
tress

   after that i put the package into
the bag and proceeded in a rational way
thinking it better to meet danger than
to fish for it

   as  continued on my way the owl
kept up its caruso solo it rather an-
noyed me to have a nocturnal canary
asking  who   who  in a short time
answering calls seemed to come from all
quarters of the mountain it did not
take me long to realize that there was
a method in these calls and that they
were gradually drawing nearer in a
narrowing circle

   finally on reaching a clearing in
the timber i realized that i was sur-
rounded by a troop of ghostlike figures
each one wearing an improvised mask

   the most prominent figure in the
group was a woman who looked like a
veritable giantess like the rest she
also wore a mask while her cloak fell
in easy folds from her shoulders over a
massive figure

  who have we here she asked

  who who piped the opera-
bouffe chorus

    an enemy to the cause came from
one of the figures in a voice that sound-
ed familiar

    step forward and make your plaint
      r r

my son commanded the massive brun-
hild

    good mother replied the owner of
the voice stepping forward  the op-
pressors of the poor have sent this man
into our midst with money to pay the
men who are ruining our retreat by cut-
ting down the trees since entering our
domain he has wrecked our cabin and
nearly killed two of your loyal subjects
he has laid violent hands on our watch-
dog and spoiled his bark and he has
offered indignities to the pet of the clan
-the sacred owl

   as the speaker proceeded i recog-
nized him as one of the men who had
held me up in the cabin and whom i
had left for dead among the wreckage

  son of iniquity thundered brun-
hild what have you to say

     nothing i replied  that i care to
say to this bunch of masqueraders mv
sole wish is to continue on my way and
continue quickly

   with that i attempted to break
through the circle but the fellow who
had summed up the indictment barred
my way

    stand back  i shouted  or by
heaven i will blow the bunch of you
into smithereens i raised the can of
dynamite above my head that all might
see it

   a mocking shout of laughter greet-
ed this threat and the fellow called
mike asked  is that a new kind of
explosiveless dynamite you are armed
with 

  no i replied not when it hits
something hard and its going to hit the
hardest thing in this locality right now
and then i let it drive straight at his
head

   he ducked and the can sailed harm-
lessly by and was caught by the man be-
hind him while i was seized and held
by a number of the other heavy villains

   the one who had caught the can
handed it to brunhild who pried off the
lid and said boys heres a treat for
you a canful of good old rough-and-
ready tobacco now you can smoke and
chew to your hearts content

   you can bet it jarred me to learn
that  had been carrying a harmless can
of tobacco around under the impression
t hat it was canned destruction the


the railroad mans magazine

tobacco was distributed and mike re-
marked 

    now friends why not burn up the
pay of those tree - chopping vandals
while we are burning up this good
tobacco

   this proposition was greeted with
a shout and the maker of the motion
took the packages from the grip sev-
eral of the others busied themselves
making a fire and when it had gotten
fairly started the packages were tossed
into the lames while i struggled to free
myself and prevent this mad act

   when the packages were consumed
the massive brunhild raised her mighty
hand and commanded silence  my
sons she asked  what is to be done
with the prisoner  

  why not do with him as with all
the other enemies of the cause   spoke
up mike

    enough of bloodshed replied the
chief ess  i have a plan it would be
a shame to sacrifice a man as brave as
he since my tim died i have looked
in vain for a man to fill his place this
man seems like a bonny lad so what do
you say to my taking him for better or
for worse and bad cess to him if its
for worse

   this proposition was received with
shouts of approval and when they had
subsided i entered a protest and swbre
i would never consent

   brunhild approached and facing
me said  think well before you refuse
to do the bidding of a lady my brave
boys will not stand for a refusal and

before speaking the word that might
mean your destruction i entreat you to
look upon the fair face you would re-
nounce

   as she ended she tore off the mask
and i beheld the bearded face of casey
the biggest devil in four counties

     what the heck  i stuttered while
the rest of the outfit pulled off their
masks and executed a wild dance around
me shouting with laughter

    monk you barbarian roared
casey  you are now a full-fledged
member of the brotherhood of joy
you stood the third degree bravely and
we are proud of you 

   and the whole thing was a joke on
you inquired de bergerac

   a rank farce hatched out by casey
he had gone to the station earlier in
the day and secured the money and
fixed up the scheme with the station-
master the whole outfit of opera-
bouffers and heavy villains was nothing
more than caseys wood-choppers

  of course we had a royal blow-
out at the lumber-camp that night but
ill bet that the man who carried the
message to garcia didnt have half the
excitement that i did in carrying the
boodle to casey

   a very interesting story comment-
ed de bergerac  i am weary so
with your permission i will reel off a
few yards of sleep should a car ap-
proach that looks as though it might be
mine kindly instruct the choffer to
await my awakening and i will give vou
a lift

new yorks abandoned railway

new york state has an abandoned
railroad line some fifty miles in
length-not an abandoned project merely
but a line on which rails were actually laid
and trains operated at one time

  in the seventies what is now the new
york ontario and western railway then
the new york and oswego midland had a
line extending from norwich in chenango
county to scipio in cayuga county a dis-
tance of  miles as reported in poors
manual for  this line apparently ran
north from norwich to de ruyter then

southwest to cortland and then northwest
to scipio

  the distance from de ruyter to cortland
is something like twenty-two miles and that
section in about  was leased to the
elmira cortland and northern and from
the remainder of the line-fifty odd miles-
the track was taken up some time during the
year s

 it is understood that the new york
ontario and western still owns the right
of way but the circumstance is not referred
to in any of the recent reports
speedy prided himself on
being the fastest man
on the division

by horace herr

railroading is a pretty serious business and the arizona in and out
system is just as seriously conducted as any other line be it large or
small but it has its human side too and the boys love to play jokes
on one another mr herrs ambitious hero recounts many that fell within
the range of his experience lin the railroad business

 -things which break the monotony

some of the yarns you hear before the call-boy comes and you
sign up for another round trip and more of
ceesars coin

ailroad men are only hu-
man they have their
jokes their adventures
and enjoy them the same
as any one else they go
about looking for a laugh
just like the rest of the world  and al-
though  am inclined to think that they

that every trip may be the last still they

 much sleep worthing about the troubles
 of to-morrow

   a great deal happens to break the mo-
 notony of the first-in and first-out service
 one day its a joke the next day its a bit
 of sentiment but it all serves its purpose

   rube was one of the best conductors
 who ever let a stinger do the work he
 knew every turn of the railroad game and
 spent all iiis spare time playing practical
 jokes and poker  and he generally got the
 best of it at both games he never got

                     single copies  cents


the railroad mans magazine

excited in a pinch and he could laugh
just as hard when looking into the face of
a head-end collision as he could when
peeking over a full on aces

  he believed that the world was made
to live in and that money was manufac-
tured to be spent and he sure lived and
spent to the- limit of his whole-hearted
creed i knew him by reputation long
before i climbed onto his dog-house for
my first trip and i was much elated to
think that the extra-board had been jug-
gled so that i caught his car

one on speedy

  speedy-never mind his last name
every one knew him as speedy-was
braking behind and i was on the smoky
end and speedy and rube made the
liveliest pair that ever kept company
month in and month out over a western
division

  speedy prided himself on being the
fastest man on the division when it came
to closing and locking a switch and catch-
ing a caboose and rube in his rough
way used to hand him the josh at every
turn of the game as the slowest mortal
that ever lived

  pulling out of adamana one morning
after having been in on the siding for
the varnished cars i let them out and
stood at the switch and let the string
drag by looking for brakes sticking

  when the caboose came along i
climbed on and speedy dropped off to
close the switch rube stood in the door
and watched him and handed him out a
line of talk about like this

   heavens sake you mut cant you
hurry a little do you want us to stop
so that you can catch up holy smoke
but youre about the slowest mortal i ever
saw 	

  by that time speedy had the switch
over and locked and was starting to run
after the caboose rube ran back to the
rear of the car picked up speedys bed-
clothes opened the rear window and
yelled

   say youll need your bed if youre
going to stay there all night and with
that he dumped them out of the window

  speedy made a great scramble for the
two blankets and the pillow and finally
caught the rear end absolutely winded

and mad as a hornet rube laughed
over that for a week before he got an-
other chance to pull off the same stunt at
the same switch

  he repeated the performance from
that time on every time we pulled out of
adamana siding until speedy stopped
him in a neat little way of his own go-
ing into adamana one morning he wait-
ed until rube was busy in the office of
the caboose and then he changed the
bedding on the bunks and put rubes
blankets and pillow on his own bunk

  when speedy swung off to close the
switch rube as usual gathered up what
he supposed was speedys bed speedy
didnt pay the least attention to them
left them lying on the track jumped on
climbed up on top and began to whistle
rube tumbled right away that he had
thrown his own bed off and the way he
pulled the air on the hog-head didnt
trouble him walk back and get them
not for little rube he made the en-
gineer back up until he gathered up that
bed and then gave him the high ball
that was the last time rube took lib-
erties with speedys bed at the switch

  after both rube and speedy had re-
ceived their walking-papers they went
into the poker business together and
cleaned up quite a nice little sum it
was said-and with a great deal of
truth too-that speedy never lost a
gambling proposition but once and that
was a bet on a horse-race and as every
railroad man who was in town the day
of that race attended the event it is just
as well that we recount it here as one of
the things which shattered the monotony
that month

speedy gets lou dillon

  speedy bought a range horse one day
that had a local reputation as a runner
and just to be in fashion he named the
nag lou dillon he almost drove every
one crazy about lou dillon until one day
old ed sawyer came in from the sheep-
range and heard some  of his remarks
about that famous horses running ability

  sawyer was a real sport he stood it
as long as he could and then he broke in

   that old plug of yours couldnt beat
a sick burro

  speedy exploded right there and of-
being a boomer brakeman



ferecl to bet one hundred dollars that his
lou dillon could beat anything in ari-
zona any distance and sawyer called
him

   ive got a lop-eared burro out at the
sheep-eamp and ill bet you old skate
and well run the race here in town a
week from sunday

  it was arranged and speedy was so

speedy to ride the horse and the burro
to run free it was agreed

  speedy mounted the famous lou dil-
lon and sawyer led the burro up to
the ten-yard mark sawyer happened to
know that lou dillon was gun-shy and
at the sound of an explosion would bolt
and run any old way

  while a mexican sheep-herder held

humpy came right through that
barbed-wire fence head first

confident that lie agreed to give the burro
ten yards handicap and run under any
conditions which sawyer might impose
the date arrived as did sawyer the
burro and the crowd

just a bit gun-shy

  when everything was ready sawyer
led the way to the only real alley in the
town when the bunch arrived at the
alley he made known the conditions of
the race the horse and the burro
would run one block down that alley

the burro sawyer went over to a near-by
yard and resurrected a large five-gallon
tin can produced several large giant fire-
crackers from his pocket twisted the
fuses together tied the can to the burros
tail lighted the fuse and dropped the
firecrackers into the can

   when the first report comes start
was all he said

  say  never saw and never expect to
see another such race in my life when
that first firecracker popped lou dillon
made a fancy pivot-swing speedy did
a double hipflap and came down on his


the railroad mans magazine

back in the middle of the alley when
lie came to the race was over

  lou dillon ran a great race but she
went the wrong way and the burro
frightened by the racket at his extreme
appendage made a fair record straight
down the alley winning hands down-
or to be more exact  tail down
speedy lost that bet and lou dillon was
placed on the market the next day

a hagenback stunt

  but to get back on the second division
with the crew  after rube left the road
by request humpy lowe caught the car
and things went along very fine for sev-
eral months i want to tell you about
the time when i received my introduction
to humpy

  he was great on hunting and one day
old george robinson myself and humpy
went out dove-shooting we were pass-
ing down through a range place when
we noted a big jersey bull standing in a
lot near by pawing the earth as if
anxious to demonstrate to some one that
he was the king of the range

  i cant imagine what put the hagen-
back stunt into humpys head but he
suddenly remarked that he could walk
right up to that bull and scratch his head
behind the ears i didnt call him a liar
but  thought it and lie must have read
my thoughts for he crawled through the
wire fence and walked toward the bull

  mr bull stood for it too humpy
walked bravely up to him laid the shot-
gun on the ground and with a few sweet
words of cheer began to scratch the bull
behind the ear calling to us that this
talk about bulls being vicious was all a
fake then he started to walk away

  as he bent over to pick up his gun
something happened and humpy came
right through that barbed-wire fence
head first-without his shotgun too

  humpy never had much to say about
the innate gentleness of the bull race
thereafter and he remarked after he had
picked the cacti from his anatomy that
it was almost the worst rear-end collision
he had ever been in

  for several weeks after humpy
caught the car there was nothing to do
but ride and draw the pay and ride some
more with an occasional hot box to

pack or a brass to put in-just enough
work to keep a fellow in practise it
seemed as if good fortune had camped
on the division for a few months and
nothing happened of a serious nature
except that jack brisco driving the lim-
ited at about fifty miles an hour hit a
stray car of flour at gallup oneday split
it right in two painted six coaches white
and not a soul was hurt and not a wheel
went off the rail

  there was nothing more serious than
porters derailment at aztec where he
hit a curve one afternoon during a sand-
storm and found the sand drifted over the
rails of course he took out across
country the engine went down an em-
bankment turning over twice but no one
was hurt except porter who broke his
nose

 then there was jack williamss
catching up with shorty riggss caboose
at cosnino jack was drifting down the
crooked track beyond cosnino pulling a
passenger-train he was trying to pick
up about fifteen minutes on the schedule
and i guess hed have done it all right
if shorty riggs hadnt been so thought-
less as to leave his caboose sticking out
of the siding onto the main line

  jack couldnt turn out and go round
so he proceeded to go through it made a
nice lot of kindling-wood put the 
over against the bank on her smoke-stack
and jack took to the air-line down a
forty-foot embankment of rip-rap broke
his leg and lost his diamond ring

 some speed yarns

  while things were running so smooth-
ly i got acquainted with the bunch a
little we would get together over at-
the reading - room and play sluff and
pool and railroad until the boxes smoked
and the rails were worn smooth ever
run up against that brand of railroading
known as  street-corner running

  well some of the most marvelous rec-
ords of speed and some of the most mirac-
ulous escapes have happened right around
at the corner grocery or over in the read-
ing-room four blocks from the railroad

  youll hear some tallow-pot tell how
they started out with forty cars behind
a baldwin hog at twelve miles an hour
and by the time lies half-way over the
being a boomer brakeman



id do that much for the dirtiest hobo on the pike

division lies running just exactly one
hundred and two and three-tenths miles
an hour and could have beat that a little
if the front end hadnt choked up

  youll hear the poor downtrodden
brakeman tell about the  pickin  being
mighty poor and the switchman telling
bow many draw - bars they have broken
in the last ten years by shoving the cut
too hard the low-water tiend will tell
the merits of his system and some tal-
low-pot with a grievance will assure you
that he couldnt keep the  hot because
old dad nance kept enough water in
her to hoat a battle-slnp and so it goes

hinkley  johns pride

  everybody talks shop until the call-
boy comes and you sign up for another
round trip and more of ctesars coin it
is in such a gathering that you hear the
unwritten legends of the road many of
them are based on fact but fancy has
added much

one of the stock stories on the ari-

zona in and out i know to have been a
fact and its worth telling for the simple
reason that it shows that railroad men
are just human like every one else and
that there is a little sentiment hidden
away even in such a man as  hinkley
john reynolds

  hinkley john was an engineer on the
second division he derived his nick-
name from the little hinkley engine
which he used to run in passenger
service and he was known over the whole
road as the crankiest man who ever
pulled a throttle but he could run
them and he had nerves of steel

  it was several years back the exact
date-well i would refer you to a bald-
headed fellow who travels under the
name of hen murray and who is prob-
ably drifting around the united states
still following the railroad game he
was the fireman on that great trip

  hen ought to know all about it for he
says that it was the fastest ride he ever
cares to take and he held his place with
hinkley as he was about the only fireman


the railroad mans magazine

on the division at that time who could
satisfy the old man things always hap-
pen in a hurry on a railroad

  one afternoon when everything was
going nicely along came a message from
headquarters saying that mr so-and-so
was rushing across the continent in a race
against death to reach the bedside of
his dying wife the order was to put
the best engine and the best available
crew on the three-car special give it the
right of way and make all the time pos-
sible

he had to double back

  the roundhouse got busy and hinkley
john just in from his regular run tired
and worn out was called to double back
on that special of course he grumbled
-that was to be expected-but he
climbed back up on the hinkley after
the hostler had coaled and watered her
and pulled down below the cut-off switch
to await the arrival of the special  red
hot  frost was the conductor

  the special arrived and mr so-and-
so proved to bea steel magnate of pitts-
burgh pennsylvania he came over to
the engine and told hinkley just how
matters stood and ended it with

   my friend please do the best that
you can run her just as fast as you
can and not place yourself in danger if
i dont get there i want to die trying

  the orders were read and signed
 red hot  frost gave hinkley the
high ball and with a toot-toot he was off

  did he run that record from win-
slow arizona to albuquerque new
mexico has been the envy of every engi-
neer on that division ever since and it
has never been equaled by twenty minutes
scottys flier wasnt in it

  hinkley had the right of track over
everything in fact the road was prac-
tically tied up while the extra passenger
raced over that two hundred and eighty-
six miles of track hinkley was only sup-
posed to pull it to gallup a distance of
one hundred and twenty-eight miles but
going through manuelito he threw off a
message to the despatcher stating that his
engine was running nicely and that he
was willing to pull the special to al-
buquerque and if everything was ok

to have the yard-crew at gallup high-ball
him at the west switch and hed go on
through

  the racing fever was on him and that
message set the despatehers afire they
cleared the yard at gallup and the crew
gave him the high sign as he came around
the curve into the station he went
through that town so fast that people
swore that there was only one car in the
train

  on over the continental divide he went
and down the eastern side and when he
hit the down grade from gonzalez to
isleta he ate up the track at something
better than a mile a minute the train-
sheets will show that the statement is a
fact and  red hot  frost now gray-
headed but still in the service will tell
you that it was one of the greatest runs
ever made by a steel horse

  he came thundering into albuquerque
three hours better than the time the head
office had guaranteed and when he
stopped the passenger was off the coach
and at the engine before the switchman
had the hinkley cut off

  he reached up for johns grimy hand
and almost squeezed the fingers off  if

i	get there in time i will remember that
mr reynolds did it he said and hand-
ed him a check

money didnt change him

  in the meantime he had climbed up on
the deck of the engine john took that
check and looked at it and right here is
where fancy has probably played its part
with the story

  some of the boys will tell you that it
was for five thousand dollars and some
claim that it was for two thousand but
the fact remains that it was for quite a
sum probably as much as hinkley could
have made in a year

  hinkley took it held his torch up to
see what it was then in the same old
crabbed way of his opened the fire-box
door and dropped it into the fire with the
remark

   youre losing time talking to me here
id do that much for the dirtiest hobo on
the pike if you get home in tune to see
her ill consider myself well paid

improvement in pay-as-you-enter cars-strengthening air hose with-
         out adding rigidity-a turntable worked by the locomo-
         tive- a switch that will not move by accident - a new
         brake-setter-ventilation for closed cars-protection from
         trolley wires-vestibule comfort for motormen

new platform barrier

improvement to facilitate entry and exit
in pay-as-you-enter
cars

numerous improvements are being
made in the construction of the en-
trance-ways to pay - as - you - enter cars
among those worthy of mention is one
covered by-patent no  august 
 issued to charles o birney of st
louis missouri at terminals and at other
points where it is necessary to discharge a
number of passengers in a short time the
present form of car of this style presents a
disadvantage tor the reason that but one
person can leave the car at a time

  it is true that all of the exits can be
thrown open but it frequently happens that
persons are standing  the platforms or
wish to enter while others are leaving the
car

  ordinarily a barrier divides both door-
ways of the car but in the patent referred
to a barrier of such construction is pro-
vided that the entire door-way at each end
of the car may be cleared for the exit of
passengers in carrying out the invention
a post is mounted about the middle of each
platform and the barrier which lakes the
place of the ordinary one now in use is
mounted upon this post in such a way that
it may be swung to extend midway of the
door-way or to establish a passage-way
from the door-way to the steps

  in other words the barrier may be moved
to divide the door-way into an entrance
passage and an exit passage or to clear the
entire way for entrance or exit alone the

conductor or motorman remains in the same
position in either instance and he has con-
trol over means which is provided for lock-
ing the barrier in either position

to strengthen air hose

a simple device for taking the strain off
the air pipe and leaving it
flexible

while air-pipe hose for conducting
air from one car of a train to an-
other is constructed in a substantial man-
ner the strain to which such hose is sub-
jected frequently results in it being broken
or torn so as to render it useless it is
true that such hose is often wrapped with
flexible metal sheathing but this renders
the hose less pliable and so is undesirable

  emil witzenmann of pforzheim ger-
many has secured a patent to 
september   on a construction of
hose for this use which is as pliable as
non-reenforced rubber hose but still is so
strengthened that it may be subjected to ex-
traordinary strain without any possibility of
injury

  in carrying out the invention lengths of
ordinary hose are employed and in the
coupling sleeve at the ends of each length
is arranged a perforated disk to which is
secured one end of a flexible chain or wire
this chain or wire is of less length than the
hose through which it passes so that should
strain be placed upon the hose tending to
stretch it such strain will be borne solely
by the length of chain or the like employed

while the hose is thus relieved of all

strain it may bo doubled nr otherwise flexed
as readily as can the ordinary hose now
employed for the purpose

engine turns itself

on this turntable the locomotive supplies
steam to attached cylinders and
does the work

every effort is now being made to do
away with the old style of turntable
in which manual labor was the motive
power and a step toward this end is dis-
closed in a patent no  september
  issued to richard r farrell of
sausilito california	v

   mr farrell thinks that the locomotive it-
self should perform this work of turning
the table upon which it is standing and he
employs such simple means to accomplish
this end that it is a wonder that others have
not thought of it before in connection
with the ordinary turn-table he provides
a large ratchet-like circular track which
extends around the turn-table and then
mounts upon the table at opposite points
steam cylinders in which work pistons
carrying toothed projection which engage
with the track

   supply pipes lead to each of the cylinders
by way of a valve chest and when an engine
has been run onto the table a branch lead-
ing from these pipes is connected to a
coupling for supplying steam from the
boiler steam is thus admitted to the
cylinders and the pistons are set in mo-
tion thereby forcing their toothed projec-
tions against the teeth of the track and
rotating the table the entire device can
be worked from the engine-cab after the
connection has been made and the table
may be stopped at any point

a secure switch

by means of a leaf spring the point is pre-
vented from having any play
not imparted

quite a novel and at the same time
entirely practical switch-point-locking
means is disclosed in a patent no 
august   issued to john h laney
of minneapolis minnesota the object of
the device is to lock a switch-point not
permanently hut  against accidental dis-
placement at either limit of its movement

   in appearance the switch is like the ordi-
nary ones now in use it consisting of the
ordinary body having the main and side

   track rail sections formed or fixed thereon
but in the underside of the switch-point
there is formed a recess which is shaped
something like a football except that the
ends of the recess are more-sharply pointed
in this recess is disposed a stout leaf-
spring which at its ends seats in the acute
ends of the recess

   the body upon which the switch-point is
 mounted to swing is formed with an up-
 standing abutment such as a pin which en-
 gages with the spring at a point midway of
 its ends when the switch-point is in main-
 track position the spring is bowed in one
 direction and when the switch-point is
 moved to side-track position it is bowed
 in an opposite direction so that no matter
 which position the switch-point may as-
 sume the spring will hold it firmly in place
 until its position is changed

   it is to be understood of course that as
 the switch-point is moved from main to side
 track position or vice versa the spring is
 first straightened and then bowed in an
 opposite direction

new brake-setter-

contrivance for tripping valve-stems with-
out destroying the valves by
its force

numeftous devices have been pat-
ented for automatically stopping a
train should any car thereof become de-
railed but such devices have usually in-
cluded in their structure trip devices which
are directly connected with valves for set-
ting the brakes these trip devices are
designed usually to come into contact with
either- the rails or the ties and the shock
incident to contact is often so severe as to
completely destroy the valve

   a device which will accomplish the same
 results but will obviate this disadvantage
 is shown in a patent no  august
   issued to john l bering of
 gainesville texas in carrying out his in-
 vention mr bering mounts beneath the
 trucks of each car of a train brackets in
 which are journaled long slender rollers at
 the inner end of the spindle on each of
 which is a crank which rotates in the path
 of a valve-stem for applying the brakes
 throughout the entire train

   normally these rollers are above and out
 of contact with the rails but should a car
 of the train become derailed they come
 into contact with the rails and are rotated
 so as to bring the cranks into engagement
 with the valve-stems thereby stopping the
 train the rollers are mounted in such a

substantial manner and their cranks have
such a slight engagement with the valve-
stems that  injury to the valves can re-
sult



ventilating cars

an exhaust method for drawing foul air
from closed pay-as-you-enter
cars

now that pay-as-you-enter cars have
come into general use it is necessary
that some means be provided for effectually
ventilating the cars in the warmer months
as the circulation of air is not as great as
in the ordinary open car to attain this
result dwight i cooke of chicago illi-
nois has devised a ventilating system which
should prove acceptable especially in view
of the fact that the passengers of the car
are not subjected to drafts

  the system devised by mr cooke is de-
signed chiefly to draw the foul air collect-
ing near the floor from the car and con-
sists of a suction fan driven by an electric
motor which is mounted upon the roof of
one platform of the car and controlled by
a switch above the head of the motorman

  leading to this fan or rather the casing
in which it is mounted are branches from
a conduit which extends the entire length
of the car beneath the roof thereof from
this conduit other branches lead to registers
beneath the seats of the car so that the foul
air is drawn from the car and fresh air may
enter at such points such as the windows
as the passengers may desire

protection from wires

a trolley-wire hanger which breaks the
circuit when a wire
falls

where overhead trolleys are used
there is a constant source of danger
from broken trolley-wires which are liable
to come in contact with pedestrians a
novel form of hanger for such wires is
shown in patent no  august 
 issued to charles a kraynik of
racine wisconsin which overcomes this
danger and renders the overhead trolley
entirely safe for street use

this hanger consists of a body portion

which has brackets projecting therefrom
and in each of the brackets there is pivoted
a trolley-wire gripping member or hanger
section these sections each have an up-
standing arm the upper end of which con-
tacts with a conductor plug which is ar-
ranged in the body portion of the hanger

  the trolley-wire supported by the hanger
is in a number of lengths the ends of which
are secured in the wire-gripping sections of
the hanger and the circuit through the wire
is established by way of the conductor
plugs referred to

  normally each section of the wire is in
circuit with every other section but should
any one section become broken the hanger
sections by which it was supported will
swing down  their pivots thereby bring-
ing their upper ends out of contact with the
conductor plug and breaking the circuit

vestibule comfort

simple device to enable motorman to
keep his windows ice and
snow free

quite a number of devices have been
patented designed to clean the snow
and ice from the window-panes in front of
the motorman of a trolley-car but nearly
all of such devices embody chains cords or
other devices which are liable to get out of
order and require frequent repair also
they are usually operated through the
medium of cranks or similar means of a
complicated nature

  a very simple and inexpensive device for
this purpose is shown in patent no 
august   issued to garnet w mc-
kee of chicago illinois instead of em-
ploying gears or like complicated means
for the purpose mr mckee provides a
long slender air cylinder which is mounted
in front of the dashboard of the car and in
which works a piston carrying at its upper
end a wiper of any suitable nature which
is normally in position against the lower
part of the window-pane directly in front
of the motorman

  the cylinder has connection with the or-
dinary air-brake pressure supply for the
car and by turning a valve the motorman
may cause the piston to rise thereby mov-
ing the wiper upward across the window-
pane and removing the snow or ice col-
lected thereon

 patient and steady mid hurrying motion
 bearing a world on a world-wide quest
 unmoved servant of mans mad speeding
 would you know when i love you best

 not in the world-wide quest unending

 not when your unreeled miles i roam
 paths of silver soft gloom-enfolded

 i love you best-when you bear me home

 seraphim swords pointing into the gloaming
 moonbeam ribbons by elfs unrolled
 fairy-touched by your magic mission

 silver lane to a heart of gold

 fain would i tell you of your high service

 star-bright trail over which i go

 but a thousand may tell and a million listen
 yet fairy path but two can know
the ten-thirty call

              by percy wilson

              pie and platitudes almost prevent the call-
              boy from getting burnsides signature

knapper was looking over the
yardmasters shoulder when
the operator handed the latter
the order for an extra as
was not unusual with him on
very slight -provocation the
yardmaster immediately
 went off the iron  wheres that call-
boy he demanded whats become
of that red-head  where is- oh   as
he turned his head and came afoul of
snappers smirking countenance  here
you are

   yes here i are  mocked snapper
 go on go on-say what you were going
to dont mind me where did you ex-
pect to find me-in your lap the
call-boy was aggrieved

   whats the earliest you can call this
extra for  was the brisk query  ten-
thirty 

  with an exasperating affectation of
indifference snapper let his eye wander
to the clock gaped a minute over the
crew-board and gradually came around
to the book  i reckon he answered
then with sudden interest  whos to
shovel smoke

   oh you take notice do you now
thats what i want to impress on you
listen	-

    laying a hand to his ear  quoted
snapper from a favorite author and
suiting action to the speech   he gave

close heed to the fiendish disclosure go
on

  the yardmaster was too accustomed to
these burlesques to honor them with any
attention  go for burnside he di-
rected

   he was let off

   i know that pay attention he
was to be off until midnight unless we
should need him in some emergency this
morning  and this is the emergency he
promised to stay at home till nine oclock
and not to leave town before ten he
glanced at the clock  its only eight-
fifty-eight now you ought to find him
easily winking to the operator

   sure  returned snapper  if only
i hadnt bent one of me wings what
was it the coal-heaver wanted off for any-
way 

   to rob a bank maybe dont both-
er me  but go get him

   put his name down said snapper
in disgust  ill get him

  the yardmaster entered the name and
handed the call-book over  now hus-
tle he directed

  snapper thrust the book in his pocket
and struck an attitude  beware james
burnside he declaimed your doom
is knelled and the avenger-

  the avenger was the yardmaster and
snapper got through the doorway just in
time to escape his foot


	the railroad mans magazine

   hang that kid  laughed the yard-
master he gets on ray nerves with
his spouting and fool antics but hes a
good caller lie observed to tlie opera-
tor   and mind my word hell come
back here with burnsides signature in
liis book heaven knows where liell
find him though for jims tricky and
hell dodge if he can he did beg hard
to be off

  in spite of his unhesitating assertion
the call-boy had very grave doubts about
getting burnside the promise to re-
main at his boarding-place for a call till
nine oclock made it unlikely that he
would be there one minute later while
the additional hour did not give much
time for finding him in a town of fifteen
thousand people what snapper most
desired to know was where was he in-
tending to go at ten he had a sus-
picion that it had something to do with
kitty c-arnigan

  it was well known among the fire-
mans acquaintances that lie was much
enamored of this black - eyed young
lady and taking into consideration the
hours he wanted leave from ten in the
morning until midnight snapper at once
decided that a knowledge of miss car-
nigans plans for the day would be very
helpful

  being too wise however to attempt
to get this from the young lady herself
as soon as he had called those two of
the crew who lived most convenient he
moved directly  the engineer whom
in the usual order of convenience for
himself he would otherwise have called
last of all his information came with-
out his asking it 

  whos to fire for me this trip
the engineer inquired as he took the
book

  cant you see said snapper lay-
ing a finger on the name

   ho   laughed the engineer  youll
not get burnside hes going out to
maple park  the ten oclock car with
his girl and her folks to a basket-picnic
hes keeping an eye peeled for you
snapper restrained himself  it
would be a shame for him to miss see-
ing me he retorted  ill go out and
let him have a look before he goes
with joy in his heart snapper went
on calling a fireman for the ten-thirty

extra was merely a matter of business
snatching burnside from a contemplated
days happiness with his lady-love would
make it a genuine pleasure it would
square up a debt too for when he had
been surreptitiously  resting his eyes
 a bench in the roundhouse some time
before this burnside had taken the op-
portunity to lampblack his face and
snapper had wandered around an hour
before discovering it  reveng-g-ge 
he muttered as he hurried to the northern
edge of town

  back of the row of houses of which
the carnigan home was one lay an
open meadow stretching to adjoining
fields and  each side to partly graded
streets at the end of the street to the
east stood the domicile of mrs cort
where burnside and several others of the
railroad men boarded

  from here a path led through the
meadow across a little stream lined with
briers and alders along the rear of the
row of houses and then to the street
through an open corner lot it made
a short cut from the boarding-house into
town and was particularly in favor
with mr burnside for the opportunities
it gave him in passing back and forth
to drop in for a word or two with miss
kitty

  allowing for the possibility of burn-
side staying overtime at the boarding-
house to make an extended toilet snap-
per went there first only to find his
room empty mrs cort could give no
information there was little hope of
catching him at carnigans for which-
ever way thehouse might be approached
there was probably a close watch kept
if burnside was there and he would
get away unseen in the opposite direc-
tion

  to lie in wait and take him from
his inamorata as they were starting for
the car would have suited the call-boys
dramatic longings most but it was not
an impossibility that the fireman had
already forestalled this by an arrange-
ment to meet the party somewhere along
the line	

  in this uncertainty the immediate
thing to be done was to get on his
quarrys trail snapper gritted his teeth
and struck across the meadow at the
farther side of the run lie stopped and
the ten-thirty call



on a sudden thought got down and ex-
amined both ends of the short plank
that spanned it without doing any-
thing more however he got up again
and went on and soon entered the car-
nigans rear gate he had kept his eye
sharply on the kitchen window and
flattered himself that he had stolen up
unnoticed yet when he stopped at the
kitchen door miss carnigan seemed not
surprised to see him

  there was something suspicious in
this to his inquiry she replied that
mr burnside had been there that morn-
ing but had gone into town was he
wanted 

  oh no he wasnt wanted snapper
had merely noted that he had been look-
ing poorly of late and stopped to inquire
about his health  gwan  said snap-
per and hurried to the front gate

  he sprinted to the corner just in time
to see the fireman turn to the right a
block ahead on an easy trot the call-
boy followed after

  to his surprise when he reached the
turn he was still nearly a block in the
rear and burnside was not running but
only walking fast snapper let himself
out several notches more and put on a
full head of steam only to find when he
came to this last corner that the fireman
had completely disappeared lounging
on a step near by however was one of
burnsides friends and snapper slack-
ened up for information

  burnside said the man yep
just passed here with throttle wide open
and both pops up hit the curve and
shot up that first alley -pointing-
 and he was going some why ill bet
he was half-way up the side of that
house when he made the turn and i
reckon youll find his footmarks on the
wall

   he called to me to tell you to hurry
up kid he said with a grin  and
you want to move lively or liell lose
you

  snapper knew this was all gammon
he glanced at his watch it was almost
nine-thirty

   ill look for those footmarks some
other time he remarked dryly im
in a hurry now and he started oft
afresh at a jog-trot in the direction
that had been indicated

  it was evident that burnside had gone
into hiding some place soon after turn-
ing the corner and there being still
time for him to get back to carnigans
and help the party with their baskets to
the car snapper wanted to give him
every encouragement toward doing it
as for himself as soon as he was safely
out of sight he put on extra speed back
toward the meadow

  once there he hastened across to the
little creek and unseating the farther
end of the plank dug some of the dirt
from beneath it and set it up again but
resting now  a pointed stone when
lie had tested it to his satisfaction he
crossed carefully back and under cover
of the bushes made his way along to
the street almost as he peered out he
saw the fireman come warily from the
corner ahead and enter the carnigan
gate

   it seems almost a shame to do it
commented the call-boy with a grin
 he acts so nice about it

  having no longer any necessity for
concealment snapper got up on the side-
walk and walked on toward the house
whistling cheerfully

   theres that long - legged kid
again   ejaculated burnside  if he
comes back here to the kitchen ill slip
out the front door and join you on the
car somewhere if he comes to the
front keep him till i can get to the
other side of the run and after hes
gone ill come around by the street
snappers schedule took him to the
front door there was  answer to
his first ring so he rang again and
shortly miss carnigan answered

  oh its you is it was her tart
greeting what do you want now
its a pity you couldnt have come
around to the kitchen door

   thats the fault of me tender heart
kitty returned the unabashed snap-
per  i want jimmy burnside and
i couldnt bear to break it to him sud-
den you tell him

   didnt i tell you he had left here 
aw quit it kitty aint he going
on the picnic with you sure

  well was the admission lie
came back after you left but lies gone
again you might find him at his
boarding-house


the railroad mans magazine

  snapper struggled to keep a straight
face

  ive been there once he returned
and the book of rules says -he held
his call-book close to his nose and
thumbed over some blank pages -  it
says here rule -in all cases of
doubt or uncertainty see for yourself
ive got to do it kitty and he pushed
past into the house

   oh very well  retorted the young
lady and followed through to where
her mother and a younger sister were
finishing the packing of the picnic-
baskets in the kitchen now are you
satisfied 

  snapper made no reply something
of more immediate interest absorbed all
his faculties for his eyes had lighted on
the top layer in one of the baskets
 are those some of your own pies mrs
carnigan he inquired in awed tones

  sure was the answer whose
would they be 

   but some that you baked yourself
he persisted with an air of strong dis-
belief

    of coorse  

   mrs carnigan -he wanted a calm
judicial answer to this question- are
your pies as good as they used to be
well i never cried mrs carni-
gan flinging up her hands  if you
aint the blarneyer  

  snapper was not a beauty he was
still growing his joints were too loose
his feet too big his clothes too small 
vet when he opened his mouth to take
in the piece of pie that was immediately
cut for him expanding until his freckles
ran together and his whole countenance
resembled nothing so much as a wedge
disappearing through a large rusty wash-
er he became for the moment a sight
that gave true joy to mrs cardigans
domestic heart

   that certainly was good he mur-
mured in heartfelt commendation as he
swallowed the last of it then he met
miss carnigans anxious eye and gave

a sudden impish start  gee kitty 
he exclaimed  some ones fell in the
creek

  kitty jumped nonsense she re-
torted  you couldnt hear that from
here

   no admitted snapper then
with a prodigious wink  but i bet
its happened just the same and
darting out the door he ran back
through the yard

  stopping at the creek merely long
enough to pull the plank out of the
water and set it roughly in place he
hastened to the boarding-house and went
softly up to the firemans room he
snickered to himself at hearing burn-
side muttering objurgations inside and
thrashing wet cjothes about

  he tried to peek through the keyhole
but the key was in it he felt sure the
door was locked and he was afraid to
try it for fear his quarry might take
warning and even yet escape by going
out the window and down over a con-
venient shed-roof

  in this dilemma-the pie furnished him
a hint for asit sought a cozy corner of
his anatomy in which to dispose itself
comfortably it gave him a gentle in-
ternal tweak in an instant he had
doubled up as though taken with a vio-
lent cramp and falling against the door
with a horrible groan seized the knob

  the door was locked but as he sank
on down to the floor he kept up a piteous
moaning in another moment the door
opened and he fell half inside

   you- began the fireman then
lost speech

   aw sign the book said snapper
thrusting it at him  and be quick
about it too he added sternly  i
cant be fooling all my time on you

  burnside mechanically signed

   i hated to wet you up jimmy
said snapper as he took back the book
but-

  he slammed the door and raced down
the stairs from the irate fireman

a flimsy order will lay out a flier but its better than a wreck

that part of the country gave him as good a bunch of yarns as he has
picked up anywhere on his interesting journey they are those fasci-
nating gripping yarns that only railroad men can tell and every man-we
dont care if he is a pinhead a tallow-pot a stinger or a ham or even if he
has never seen a railroad-will want to read them

one look up at the tracks and then beat
it back to los angeles or pasadena
vowing never again even to i think of
climbing any mountain by rail

    those men were courageous-looking
enough but what they lacked was stom-
ach

 man conductor trainmaster despatcher
 track-walker section foreman road-
 master general manager and acting
 general superintendent of one of the
 most remarkable railways in america
 it was the incline railway of mount
 lowe california within a short trolley
 ride of los angeles

  the incline ivas steeper than the one
at mount washington steeper than the
one at pikes peak steeper than the one
up the rigi in eight minutes you
made a rise of fourteen hundred feet on
a grade of sixty per cent

  the car in which we made the ascent
was called the  white chariot its
construction was adapted to carrying
thirty passengers up an incline that came
mighty near being a perpendicular it
had three compartments of two seats
each with each compartment on a dif-
ferent floor level and could be com-
pared to nothing better than a steep

front stoop of three huge steps to
this car falls the honor of making the
steepest ascent and descent in the world

its perfectly safe

  safe continued the roads pooh
bah  i should say we are safe weve
been running for sixteen years and
never hurt so much as a passengers
finger-nail the power that hauls us up
is furnished by electricity from a plant
down in altadena at the foot of the
mountain you notice that endless wire
cable to which we are attached well
its one and a half inches and its
regularly tested to carry a hundred
tons

  at the top is the heaviest mountain -
hauling machinery you ever clapped
eyes on-with a prodigious cogwheel
embedded in solid granite with the
least derangement of machinery wed
stop and hold fast and all hands would
be as safe as  the level

  yet i dont guess but what were
as near as we can get to being an ele-
vator and still run  tracks watch
what a neat job well make of passing
yonder descending car

  we were half-way up had covered
fifteen hundred feet of track and had
risen seven hundred feet right there
we made an automatic  turn out  to let
the descending car pass for there were
two  white chariots and every time
one arrived at the top of the mountain
the other arrived at the foot

just like ballooning

 its like rising in a balloon i said

   youve hit it right said mr pooh
bah  and when you reach the top
youve ballooned to a point as high up
as vesuvius were a declivity all right
ive heard folks who came direct from
travel in switzerland board us and cry
out the swiss alps were never like
this 

   why look at that view youre
taking in a panorama of geography of
about seventy-five to  a hundred square
miles theres the pacific ocean over
there-and catalina island far out at
sea and theres san pedro and long
beach and venice and santa monica

and look at that san gabriel valley
looks like a checker-board doesnt it
with its orange-groves and vineyards
and los angeles looks like a mere vil-
lage eh 

  we owe the whole business to the
man after whom this mountain is named
-professor t s c lowe he solved
all the engineering difficulties-got rich
men to back him and form a stock com-
pany

  here the car came to a stop and mr
pooh bah turning to the passengers
said  this is as far as we go ladies
and gentlemen yonder car will wind
you up the mountain another fifteen-
hundred feet to the alpine tavern
give my regards to my friend mr
deering

the cotton brokers yarn

   whos he i asked bluntly

   mr deering oh hes a cotton
broker from memphis tennessee hes
chock-full of yarns of california-yarns
that we native sons never heard tell of
before and hes the jolliest man ive
ever met on this railroad-i mean the
jolliest excepting one who was a rail-
road telegrapher

  hearing this i pricked up my ears

 railroad telegrapher you say who
was he 

   say you just ask anybody in los
angeles about rufus haines he died
the other day aged eighty-two yet up
to the day of his death he was as hale
as you or i he was strong enough to
vote for taft on election day-and a
few hours later he sank into the long
sleep he used to love to come up this
mountain how he did enjoy himself
up here where he said he could get the
proper perspective  life

   he came from bath maine where
he first learned telegraphy he came to
california as a pioneer iong before we
ran the first railroad through this val-
ley-the los angeles and san gabriel
valley railroad that was and when
the railroad came he worked on it as
an operator-and the other day the big-
gest bunch of railroad telegraphers ever
seen in one house at one time hereabouts
gathered at his bier

   yes rufus haines was a pioneer
riding the rail from coast to coast



he came to california in the time of
the vigilantes well so long

just one moment mr pooh bah
i said  didnt rufus haines ever tell
you something in particular about the
vigilantes 

 i should say he did-often he

haines said that it rang altogether too
vigorously and persistently for a mere
fire haines sprang out of bed to see
what the rumpus was about and this is
what lie learned

 first of all with the ringing of the
bell the members of the committee of

told me the story of tom tanner tom
tanner you see was one of those rogues
that the vigilantes put to death for
stealing it was at marysville cali-
fornia-that town having its committee
of twenty-five

   rufus haines told me how one
night lie was in marysville when the
iire-bell was given a terrible ring

twenty-five jumped from between sheets
and assembled to find that the midnight
call was to the release  bail of a man
who had been captured in the act of
stealing a sack of potatoes that was
tom tanner

   tanners house had been searched
previously by some of the committee
and great quantities of stolen merchan-

 youve ballooned to a point as high up as vesuvius


the railroad mans magazine

dise unearthed and now he was caught
red-handed swiping a sack of potatoes
tanner was taken before a judge named
wilkins who let him go on a two-thou-
sand-dollar bond this actof the judge
displeased the vigilantes justice was
deemed not swift enough indignation
spread among the townspeople-and
they rang the fire-bell calling out the
committee members

   all night they searched for tanner
in the early morning they caught him
trying to escape from town they
caught him in the act of throwing some-
thing into a stream - a buckskin bag
containing four gold watches

tanner gets his

   those gold watches shortened tan-
ners life by some years the vigilantes
had intended only to put him back in
jail and compel judge wilkins to keep
him there by canceling his bail bond
but the gold watches - that settled it
the vigilantes determined to hold tan-
ner as their own prisoner and try him
themselves

   the committee formed itself into a
court within fifteen minutes the pres-
ident of the committee who had acted
as judge came out and reported to the
great crowd that had assembledin front
of committee headquarters that tanner
had been found guilty of grand larceny

    hang him  shrieked the crowd
and it was never recorded haines told
me as a lynching for the vigilantes
commanded sheriff gray to do the job

   meantime the thiefs wife with her
two children passed through the crowd
pleading piteously for mercy for her
husband all in vain

   that was not all haines said that
the vigilantes sometimes dealt out jus-
tice to bad men thus swiftly yet ven-
geance did not end even with death in
tanners case the vigilantes drew up a
petition and got the mayor of marysville
to refuse to allow the body of tanner
to be buried in the cemetery as a re-
sult all that was left of the thief was
given to earth in a lonely spot outside
the town limits

   nor was that all body-snatchers
that very night stole up on their awful
errand-only to sneak away when they

saw the widow of tanner standing
guard at the grave

   next morning the widow had the
body brought to her home and interred
in her back yard where she watched it
night after night for weeks

  well so long remember me to
mr deering

  i now began the tortuous rail journey
up to the alpine tavern around
curves and along fearsome precipices
the car wound its way-it was an over-
head trolley by the way-and sometimes
as many as four levels of the railway
could be seen at once

  arrived at alpine tavern i found it
standing in snow though i was barely
an hour from the flower-beds of the val-
ley in the log hotel i pulled a rock-
ing-chair up to the log fire on the hearth
and while warming my feet read this
sign over the fireplace

te ornament of a house is ye guesl who
doth frequent if

   a new ornament has arrived i see
said a voice behind me i turned and
beheld a man wearing miners boots
polo riding-breeches a corduroy hunting-
coat a red sweater and a golf cap

   my names deering said he
 memphis is my home town im in
cotton whats your line

   railroads glad to know you mr
deering that pooh bah on the slight
declivity one must hazard to get here
wishes particularly to be remembered
to you

californias only cotton crop

   bully for him  cried deering
 did he tell you that story i told him
of the first and only and last cotton
crop ever raised in california

  no wasnt aware they had ever
raised so much as a spool of cotton in
this state

   wasnt aware let me put you
wise youre in railroads you say
well you ask the santa fe and the
espee how they once heralded to the
people that they were preparing to haul
a california cotton crop to a waiting
riding the rail from coast to coast



world those railroads informed the
whole country that a cotton crop cover-
ing six hundred and forty acres was
about to be hauled by them and that
within a year or so theyd be hauling
cotton from six thousand acres

   those cotton acres were down
bakersfield way on the kern river
the cotton was there-yes it was all
there and so were the cars there ready
to move it but the cotton stayed right
where it grew

fisher gets on the job

   the man responsible for that lone
cotton crop of california was jim
fisher jim was a partner of haggin
the california mine-owner
and horse - racer fisher
himself had his own barrel
of money and he raised the
cotton on his own hook
too-it werent none of
haggins affair i f hed had
a partner he would not
have dared to do what he
did to that cotton and i
would not have had this
yarn to spin

  jim fisher tapped the
kern river much to the
chagrin of agriculturists
down the valley- he built
a big canal and a lot of lit-
tle canals and he called the
same an irrigation plat

when he got square miles
upon square miles ready
for business he got a bug
in his head his bug was
cotton

    why should not cali-
fornia be a cotton state
he asked himself and in
the course of his dream he
went to the railroads and
told them what he contem-
plated doing could the
railroads move his cotton
at a figure that would leave
him a margin of profit

you bet the railroads could
do that-and so jim fisher
went to work

   he planted cotton on
six hundred and forty

acres he built a house for himself
right where he could sit and watch
that cotton grow and its a fact
the cotton grew it quickly came to a
head

  jim fisher had started the thing
as an experiment but here it was real-
ized he rubbed his eyes - but there
was the cotton growing and growing
and getting to the puff-ball point where-
at it had to be picked p d q or the
winds of heaven would carry it away

  then jim fisher saw that lie had
to get right on the job

    got to provide for some one to
pick it quoth fisher he sent to
bakersfield and fresno and los an-
geles and a heap of other places and
ordered carpenters to come
forth the carpenters came
and fisher set them to
work building shacks-oh
just dozens of shacks

    but you dont need all
these shacks for pickers for
just this little six-hundred-
acre crop protested the
boss carpenter

    you go right on build-
ing shacks all the same
answered jim fisher  i
know what im doing
next year or in two years
at the most therell be six
thousand acres in cotton to

   caught red-handed
swiping a sack of po-
tatoes


the railroad mans magazine

be picked and ill need the shacks to
house the pickers

   meantime the railroad traffic men
and the industrial men of the lines came
down to fishers irrigation plat and at
sight of the cotton their eyes bulged out
of their astonished heads they went
back to frisco and wherever else they
came from and spread the glad tidings

about unionizing those cotton-pickers
he said to them

    this here cotton of fishers simply
has to be picked-now or never he
cant get other pickers here in time to do
the job hes simply got to leave the job
to us fellers on the spot see well
to-morrow mornin well ask for six dol-
lars a day see

 

o

you boys been sittifj up all night raising the pay-rate have you

broadcast cotton in california the
thing seemed a miracle with jim fisher
as the magician

three dollars a day

   i want cotton-pickers now said
jim fisher to the railroad passenger de-
partments  please get em for me-get
a regiment of them my cotton has to be
picked within a week

   forthwith into that irrigated section
poured cotton-pickers they asked three
dollars a day and  found and fisher
gave them all they asked he installed
them in the shacks he fed them right
smart one sunday night he said to
them to-morrow boys well begin
picking

   that night the  boys  put their
heads together under the leadership of
a foreman from the south who must
have been at some time in his life a very
jim-dandy of a labor leader he was an
organizer he was lie knew how to go

   monday morning came and there
was jim fisher on the field bright and
early ready to direct the picking oper-
ations just as the sun rose that fore-
man went to fisher backed up by a
timorous committee and says

    mr fisher we-all reckon that our
labors worth six-dollars a day

they raise the ante

   now fisher was one of those men
who always had a cigar in his mouth
he blew out clouds of smoke took his
cigar out of his mouth scrutinized its
burning end closely put it back between
his teeth then said very quietly

   you boys been sittin up all night
raising the pay-rate have you  

   yes mr fisher the price of labor
on the cotton-fields of california has
riz

    and have you boys considered the
fact that six dollars a day eats up my
profits on this crop
riding the rail from coast to coast

    dont know nothing about that mr
fisher just know that six dollars is
about our size

    you do do you in hat ease
the crop is worthless

  and-what do you think jim fisher
did he turned to where lie could lace
his broad acres of growing cotton took
his cigar from his teeth flicked the ash
from it touched its lighted end to the
nearest cotton-puff

   the puff blazed instantly and the
fire was carried to other cotton-bolls in
a jiffy there was a sizzling and crack-
ling such as you can hear only in a burn-
ing cotton-patch

a vanishing dream

   you bet the foreman was frightened
with a shout he ordered iris men to
jump in and beat out the blaze for now
they stood to lose even their three dol-
lars a day

  stand back shouted jim eisner
drawing a gun  this is my cotton and
ill shoot the first man that lays hand
or foot on my property 

   by nightfall the whole six hundred
acres had become a blackened smear on
the landscape all day long j im fisher
sat on his porch watching his dream go
up in smoke the wires ticked the news
in the railroad offices throughout south-
ern california there was weeping and
profanity

  heres a tale that might be entitled
 the adventures of the paymasters
roll i was  seeking my prey  in the
espee yards hard by the arcade station
los angeles whei one of the yardmen
said  the signal is set for the honey-
moon shell be here in a minute

  i asked him what he meant by  honey-
moon and he told me that the night-
train from frisco brought down so many
newlyweds that it had been given the
unofficial name of honeymoon limited
the train pulled in and one of the
sleepers was cut out shunted to a far
siding and given over to the cleaners

  i stood watching the cleaning process
as applied to that sleeper when suddenly
a porter leaped from the step and dashed
up the yard as if his very life depended
upon his getting quickly away from that
vicinitv 

  about ten minutes later a well-dressed
man came running up all out of breath
and crying to the cleaners at the win-
dows  is this that sleeper from the train
from san francisco

   on being told that it was the car the
wild-eyed man asked  and did you find
anything under the pillow in lower
five

   no sir-we didnt but the porter
did

   porter where is he

    dont know sir hes gone ten min-
utes and more

  here the worried-looking man turned
to me saying  i lost my pocketbook in
that car think i left it under my pil-
low in the berth it contained a thou-
sand in real money took a motor-car
from the station to the alexandria hotel
only to find i hadnt money enough to
pay the chauffeur so  got the driver
to run me back here as fast as the law
would permit

    think you will find your wallet
 said  if you will go to pullman head-
quarters up the street i saw a porter
make a getaway from here a few min-
utes ago and the chances are a million
to one that lies gone to headquarters to
turn in your wallet

 shore enough  dough

   do you really think so ill go
there at once

  twenty minutes later the porter re-
turned to the car smiling from ear to
ear

   easy money boss he said display-
ing a yellowback

   ah suspicioned that pocketbook con-
tained shore enough real money and ah
ran mah legs off to get mahself exoner-
ated at the pullman office ahm goin
to treat mahself to-day to the fines
chicken dinner los angeles can cook

   that man is the paymaster of a navy
ship south dakota his names nichol-
son and he rode with me last night from
frisco on his weddin trip twenty
dollars dont you go foolin your-
selves he added turning to the cleaners
 that it dont pay in this business to be
honest

  the santa fe station at pasadena-
thirty minutes from ios angeles-stands


the railroad mans magazine

his life depended on his getting away from
that vicinity

picturesquely in the grounds of the green
hotel just outside of the station there
is an artistic summer-house or outdoor
waiting-place with comfortable seats for
waiting passengers there under the
wide-spreading palms in the velvety
night characteristic of that semi-tropical
land i sat in company with one of the
railroad watchmen or depot policemen

   it looks to me he said  like more
soldiers of fortune come from the ranks
of the railroad army than from any other
calling there was jim leonard for
instance it was railroading that made
him a soldier of fortune hes some-
where in the china seas at this minute-
a sailor before the mast of a tramp a
man without a country without a port
or a flag just a human derelict with a
price on his head

a soldier of fortune

   now the way we came to know of
jim leonards latest move was by a
strange accident we had given him up

months ago as dead or lost
when only the other day a
prospector all dust from the
desert and all rags from en-
counters with mesquit comes
into los angeles on a santa
fe train displays a letter and
says

    that there is from a
stranger to me named jim
leonard ive carried it two
thousand miles just out of
brotherly love for one who
like myself is a soldier of
fortune

  to go back a little i
must tell you that jimmy was
known to a lot of folks in
los angeles and pasadena
for hed been in this country
for seven years last april
he applied for a job as a po-
liceman on the los angeles
force and was sworn in by
july however he got tired
of walking a beat and swore
he would become a railroad
man so as to see something of
the world well lies seen a
heap of the world and i
reckon he wishes he had
stayed on the police force

   resigning his police job he went to
an employment agency in los angeles
that was advertising for men to go to
mexico to work on the railroads there
he was promised a job as foreman of a
section-gang of peons if he would drop
down to guaymas

quits being a cop

   according he got a free ride to
guaymas-just what he was looking for
he was seeing the world they were
building a railroad down there and jim-
my got the job as promised it was a
good jol too if only jimmy had held
on to it and had left the mescal alone
on the sabbath

   the next thing we knew jimmy was
lodged in the guaymas jail charged with
murder and then we heard no more from
him and gave him up for a goner

   months passed and jusf the other
day as ive said a miner comes into
ios angeles with a letter in jimmys
riding the rail from coast to coast



own hand how that miner came by
that letter beats all fiction he found it
in an old sack under a lot of rubbish in
a box car on the railroad way down on
the west coast

  jimmy himself had left the letter in
that box car in the bare hope that it
would be found by an american and
somehow get to los angeles

jims last letter

   the miner was beating his way up
to the rio grande and as he had read
enough of jimmys letter to get him into
sympathy with jimmys plight he hung
on to the document till he delivered it to

the man to whom it was addressed in
los angeles

  you see jimmy had no money for
a postage-stamp  and besides he would
not dare trust that letter to the post-
office in mexico at just the time it was
written anyway

   well ive seen the letter and i know
what it says jimmy tells how he came
to be charged with murder he had
been celebrating the sabbath in town
with overmuch mescal and on the road
back to camp he overtook a peon who
he says picked a quarrel with him and
attempted to draw a gun

  jimmy says that he shot the peon
dead he then went back to the railroad

jimmy says that he shot the peon dead


the railroad man s magazine

camp a decidedly sober man and con-
fessed to the superintendent telling all
that had happened the superintendent
told him that the safest thing for him to
do would be to get out of the country
jimmy hid in a box car and got almost
to the rio grande when he was cap-
tured

stay in gods country

   they took him back to guaymas and
locked him in a filthy prison where he
was chained in his cell then they con-
demned him to serve a long term at the
salt mines which almost surely means
death while awaiting transportation to
the mines jimmy with the aid of some
mexican friends managed to escape
from jail again he hid in a box car
and he writes how he suffered cruelly
from extreme heat and thirst and hunger

   he tells too how his friends had
arranged for him to ship before the mast
on a tramp vessel from some port on the
mexico west coast and how if ever the
letter reached ios angeles wed know
what had become of him as the vessel
was bound for the china seas jimmy
assures us that he killed that peon in
self-defense

   but the part of jimmy leonards
letter that interested me most was where
he spoke of leaving us to see the world
 railroading is all right he wrote  so
long as you railroad in gods country
but dont any of you get the idea that
youll see a whole lot of the world
through going to some other country to
railroad for youll only see trouble and
suffering like  have if only i had
stayed a policeman with the job of hunt-
ing criminals instead of being myself
hunted at this moment with a price on
my head and with no country and no
flag  would have remained a happy
man tell all the railroad boys who
knew me that i say to them stick to
your job like the postage-stamp does
and dont think of going railroading any-
where else for happiness is right in your
own dooryard 

the worst on record

  when i reached the arroyo l eiit
to the foreman of the scction there and

asked him if he remembered the terrible
wreck on the night of may   i
had been told of this particular wreck
and the ingenious and fiendish device by
whiclvit was accomplished and i wanted
to see-with my own eyes just how that
trap was sprung 

  do  remember answered the
foreman one omara  i should say i
do i ought to know because i was
called out of my bed at one in the morn-
ing

   it was the espees coast line flier
one man was killed and twenty-two
wounded of whom three afterward died
in hospital in all my railroading days
i have never seen such horror or such
suffering nor have  ever seen or heard
of any trap for wrecking a train so dia-
bolical as that we found had been sprung
that night

   along comes the flier three hours
late janis was in the cab and going
like mad it was pitch-dark and how
could he be expected to see a trap
come out on the trestle my boy and ill
show you exactly where the trap was
set

when the crash came

  he led me out on the trestle over the
arroyo seco and pointed to a certain
fish-plate  here he said  is the ex-
act spot at which the engine ran off the
rails and here it is where the tender the
diner the buffet-car two pullman sleep-
ers and the mail and express cars plunged
off the trestle and tumbled the sixteen
feet to the bottom of the arroyo

   three of the cars were completely
overturned-the buffet the express-car
and one pullman all the other cars
landed on their sides

   by the time i got here the cries of
those pinioned under the wreckage and
the moans of the wounded was something
terrible with axes we hewed away till
we made holes in the cars for the pas-
sengers to climb out i myself meanwhile
helping women and children to climb out
of windows and doors

   then along came a relief-train from
los angeles with doctors aboard and
the wounded were carried off to the city

   with the wounded out of the way
i went with the trainmen to try to dis-
cover what had happened to that flier
riding the rail from coast to coast



 storni steals up behind the reader real sleuth fashion

-	st 

gether with-its bolts had been removed
the fish-plate connects these two rails
of course through the holes in the
rails from which the bolts had been re-
moved those dastardly rascals whoever
they were had drawn heavy wires-one
wire for each rail

   then the two wires had been joined
into a single strand and the strand itself
was what we found that night leading
away into the bushes  the steep em-
bankment there

   now see how the trap worked
when the flier reached the trestle all
those wreckers had to do was to pull on
the wires thus spreading each one of
these connecting rails out toward the edge
of the trestle

   ill wager youll travel this country
over and never anywhere else hear of any
such devilish trap as was sprung on us
that night the espee put up ten thou-
sand dollars reward for the arrest and
conviction of the fiends but so far as i
know the reward is still unclaimed

  j went down to san pedro the port

washington where most of that lumber
comes from had i seen so much wood-
stuff in one place at one time

  that lumber was consigned to a hun-
dred different places in the southwest
and a huge instalment of it was started

	its journey each day hauled by en-
gine no  of the southern pacific-
an eight-drive-wlieel compound one of
the biggest on the pacific coast

  the day i was at san pedro an espee
lumber-train stood ready to pull out it
was in charge of conductor gilbert with
engineer cram up at the head if i had
wanted then to walk from the caboose
where i met conductor gilbert up to
engineer crams cab i would have had
to walk exactly hall a mile for that
train was twenty-five hundred feet long

   now dont tell me you ever saw a
logging train or any other kind of wood-
stuff train just as big as this because you
didnt not even in oregon said con-
ductor gilbert  weve got fifty-six
cars loaded with  feet of lum-
ber weighing  pounds and

i would have sworn the trestle itself was
all right for i had been over it just
before sundown but all the same the
trouble lay in the trestle and not in the
engine or cars what do you think we
found 

the telltale wires

  you see this fish-plate here well
it-or the one that was here when i in-
spected this trestle that evening-to-

of los angeles you can inhale the fra-
grance of san pedro before you fairly
get within her limits for she smells of
pine lumber-smells of it while you are
yet afar off not even in oregon or

xe 


the railroad mans magazine

  worth  and what will surprise
  you most is that we pull a load
  just like this out of san pedro every
  day of the week were  slouches
  when it comes to lumber

two thousand tons daily

    i walked that half-mile just the same
  up to 

     aint she a beauty  exclaimed en-
  gineer cram meaning his eight-drive-
  wheeler  she hauls her two thousand
  tons of wood out of here every day and
  the prettiest thing about her is this little
  lever here indicating the  handle 
  connecting the air-brakes

     by merely touching this lever went
  on cram  with a childs touch i con-
  trol a half-mile of cars with their pro-
  digious weight but say you going up-
  to los angeles now well if you think
  you see wood here just go down to our
  yards there and take a look at more
  wood in one place than youll ever see
  anywhere else  matter how much you
  travel

    in los angeles i went to that part of
  the espee yards mentioned by engineer
  rcram and there indeed was a city of
  wood there were  less than thirty
  acres of railroad ties i speak of them
  as a city because those ties piled up as
  high as the highest two-storv bungalow
  were arranged symmetrically in blocks
  like the streets of a city

   those ties were brought to los
 angeles by ship and train from the
 northwest and there piled up to dry
 after which they would be treated to a
 bath of zinc oxide and shipped to all
 parts of the harriman system i was
 told that it was the largest collection of
 railroad ties on earth

 - a city of ties

    now through the streets of this city
  of ties rail railroad tracks and over these
  rolled freight-trains here unloading
  there loading more and more ties so that
  the millions of ties seemed never to be
  reduced in number

     welcome to our city of sleepers
  said an old brakeman with a winning
  smile  i saw you either making notes
  or reading from a book as we came up

he added  and you reminded me of that
chap we overhauled the other day in the
yards at santa barbara queer case
that

  the brakeman sat down on the side of
his flat car took a chew of tobacco-
lighted cigars and the like being prohib-
ited in this city of sleepers-and then
proceeded

   yes queer case say can you tell
me what on earth a thief wants to steal
bibles for and only bibles i mean
why does he want to steal only bibles
when he might have stolen other things
-prunes for example

the espee bible thief

   well that case up at santa bar-
bara was one of theft of bibles only
when the thief might have taken other
things of the kind i have mentioned
no  of our line was running some-
where between san luis obispo and
guadaloupe when some one busted a car-
seal and ransacked the car and made off
with a heap of bibles

   when the train got to santa bar-
bara the broken seal was discovered-
the bibles were gone but all the prunes
and other things in that car were left
where they were though all the cases
containing them had been mercilessly
smashed open

   and here comes a joke  bill stor-
ni-lies a constable at santa barbara
storni one day soon after the robbery
was walking through the espee yard be-
tween a lot of lumber-cars when he espies
a tramp reading a book storni steals up
behind the reader real sleuth fashion
to see what sort of literature was there
on exhibition

  a bible by jove cries storni
pouncing upon die reader  i reckon
friend you are wanted in this precinct
what you got to say for yourself

  wanted for what inquires the
bible class of one member meeklike

    for stealing bibles of course out
of that espee car the other day up san
luis obispo way

    my good friend and brother says
the bible class in a psalm-singing sanc-
timonious tone  let me remind you that
persons who read bibles do not steal
them

synopsis of previous chapters

stephen paget a retired newspaper man and his friend marshfield are at-
tracted by the sight of a beautiful girl in a poor building opposite pagets apartment
a few minutes later a middle-aged woman in the street below is heard to scream
hysterically and on paget rushing down to find out the reason she says she has seen
the evil one indicating as the place the room in which the two men have just seen the giri
paget escorts the woman to her store in the basement of the cheap house where he learns
that her name is rosa and that she and the girl maria bigontina live in the room above
some days later paget finds the girl in a park homeless rosa has disappeared and
marias brother is also lost paget arranges for her to stay at the walton until her
people can be found he goes to interview the landlord who has turned her out and
in her room has an adventure with several italian cutthroats dining with maria he
is warned by a hungarian orchestra leader not to take the first cab or walk when going
home

     the cab they do take breaks down and in the confusion they are actually led into
taking the first cab the driver tries to abduct them but paget thrashes him and after
seeing maria to the walton he changes coats with the driver and goes to the place the

     maria sees paget with signor rocca her enemy and thinks he has betrayed her
rocca invites stephen and young marshfield to lunch and afterward asks stephen to go
and see some abyssinian specimens at his warehouse it is the same address as they
had attempted to lure paget and marja to before

       chapter xvi	some mask for my feelings was necessary

       ii 	the napkin and the couh were the first

    i learn more of my host	whjch ccurred o   j coughed un

he hand that was about to	til my face was purple

raise the cigar to my lips	some water mr paget with

fell to my side my jaw	the greatest solicitude rocca filled a glass

dropped and i stared at the	from the carafe and handed it to me i

man white and gasping	took it from him drained it and set it

then abruptly i snatched	down

the napkin from the table buried my face	 thank you something caught in

in it and fell to coughing it was an old	my throat-most disagreeable

device as old as social hypocrisy but	i pushed back my chair and rose to
         began in the august railroad man magajine single copies  centi




the railroad mans magazine

face him my mind was clear now  in
barent street if you know where that
is the words were the key to all the
puzzles of the past at their sound the
mysteries which had so perplexed me
fell into orderly ranks like well-drilled
troops ready for my inspection

  rocca was the chief with whose name
ghedina had terrified the scoundrels of
the auvergne he it was who wanted
both the girl and the missing  key 
locked in my desk it was his warehouse
to which i had driven in the clothes of
the cabman

  and rocca had been in the cab with
me when i stopped in eleventh street to
talk to mrs noyes and maria it was
from him she was fleeing and she had
seen him in my company that was why
 was  vile that was enough for me
my heart leaped and my love sang in my
breast

  i did not stop to piece together the
puzzle i knew now why maria had
turned against me i knew from whom
came the blows aimed at her it was
enough the rest-abyssinia the missing
pietro-all could wait

   well mr paget if you have recov-
ered we might start

   oh yes  certainly

  i dropped the napkin clutched in my
hand on the table and turned away
nothing was further fromcmy intention
than to visit s barent street in this
mans company inwardly i blessed the
cabman who had given me the informa-
tion without it i should have walked
blindfold into the trap so carefully pre-
pared

  it was for this that david had been
politely removed-the son of old marsh-
field rocca did not dare to touch but
the obscure stephen paget was easier
prey my one protection as ghedina
had said was my knowledge of marias
hiding-place that knowledge i had un-
masked to rocca  there was nothing now
to prevent my being put out of the way
as an unwelcome intruder who knew too
much

  all this i realized there was one
thing i did not know-how to free my-
self from the spiders web into which i
had so rashly ventured

   i will call a cab said rocca he
walked over to the telephone in the-

library of the apartment and i heard
him summon a carriage while i sat rack-
ing my brains for some excuse which
would not betray my knowledge to my
host

   it will be here in a minute the
italian turned from the instrument with
his affable smile  will you have some-
thing while you wait-whisky and soda
the americans like i am told

   thank you like my friend i fear
i have also forgotten an engagement
it just occurred to me while you were
telephoning  added hastily catching
the sudden chill in roccas deep-set eyes

  the smile on his lips was still there
had i known nothing of barent street
i would never have thought to have
watched his eyes

  an engagement do you young
men have so many engagements or so
few that you can not remember them
an hour in advance  

  it does seem rude i rose to my
feet answering the apparent and natural
pique of my host  you must give me
another opportunity to apologize this
afternoon i can only ask your indul-
gence

  it was clumsy i knew as clumsy as
the cough but i preferred to be clumsy
rather than dead roccas gang was not
going to  get  me in  barent street
and the quicker i was out in the broad
light of new yorks afternoon the better
for me my host merely smiled in
gentle disappointment

   it is unfortunate i had looked for-
ward to a pleasant and profitable hour
or two but youth will be served vic-
tor mr pagets coat and hat you left
them inside i think

   si signore at his masters sum-
mons victor had appeared from the hid-
den regions of the apartment and now
stood in formal respect before us hav-
ing declined roccas invitation to walk
into his trap it seemed that i was to
follow in marshfields footsteps and be
eliminated by sheer cold courtesy from
his presence

  i could ask for nothing better my
one desire was to return to maria toex-
plain my association with her foe with
her aid to unravel the tangle of the situa-
tion and then to act expecting to be
helped into my overcoat i half turned
the spider

to victor the servant stood there
silent decorous obviously efficient and
perfectly trained he held neither my
hat nor my coat

   where are mr pagets things vic-
tor i told you to get them

  roccas voice was sharp with com-
mand and displeasure apparently lack
of attention to a guest caused him more
concern than all the black crimes my
mind was laying at his door

   i did not understand sir i took
them-inside to brush them but i have
not as yet had the time shall i fetch
them or will the gentleman wait

   you are stupid the gentleman does
not wish to wait stay we will get
them ourselves this way mr paget
i want to show you some of the possi-
bilities of a new york apartment since
you have not the time to investigate the
possibilities of abyssinia

  i cared nothing for his apartment
but i cared less about marching into the
street hatless and coatless also i was
anxious to delay the inevitable arousing
of his suspicion his ignorance of my
knowledge was a weapon i meant to use
and i followed him obediently as he led
the way from the dining-room into a
small pantry

  rocca flung open another door in
a space that was half closet and half
room lighted only from the pantry i
saw hanging on a wall two or three hats
and coats

  which is yours mr taget

  rocca stood with his hand upon the
knob waiting behind him victor
blocked the entrance to the dining-room
why had the butler turned himself un-
asked into a tailor for my benefit and
why was the great italian now doing his
servants work for him

  there was nothing to show any one
in a coat-closet and a pantry i looked
sharply not at the row of garments hung
up for my inspection but at the impas-
sive face of my host he moved a little
impatiently

   will you see which is yours mr
pa-

  his great form flattened against the
door as i drove my fist into his moving
lips his left hand had risen to the back
of his neck it was the signal with which
cagno had hurled his ruffians  me in

of palermo	

the attic once more i was beforehand
with them

  victor leaped as i struck i felt his
arms wrap themselves about my body
felt myself falling backward into the
hidden peril of the closet clutching
wildly in the air my hands closed about
the head of the man i had dazed with
the blow for an instant the three of
us swayed unbalanced on the threshold
then the mass toppled and fell

  rocca was used to fighting with his
brains not his hands to that fact i am
convinced i owe my life what my blow
had begun the fall completed and he
lay inert and more than half-stunned
upon the floor the valet was made of
sterner stuff his arms were about me
like the coils of a serpent i could
writhe and kick at nothing but i could
not loosen that paralyzing grip

  his dark face was close to mine as
we tossed about the floor the eyes
which had been so veiled with quiet
deference blazed above me and i felt
his hot breath on my cheek suddenly
the coils about me loosened of their own
accord one hand shot to my throat
pinning me to the ground choking the
very life from me the other reached
back for the knife-the silent beloved
weapon of the mediterranean outlaw

  he could have strangled me there
without a sound strangled me and none
of the hundreds hurrying along the side-
walk a few feet below would ever have
heard a cry he could have-but he did
not the latin does not murder with
his naked hands the man had spent his
life with the knife the thought of it
and the use of it were born in his blood
now in the moment of his triumph he
readied for it

  it was a disastrous blunder though
the grip  my throat never loosened
his weight lifted from my body as he
rose striving to free the useless weapon

  my knee shot up it caught him an
inch below the ribs and every rigid
muscle of the man shriveled the
weight of the body fell back upon me
but now it was a dead-weight before
the breath returned i bad flung it from
me and staggered up to reel gasping
and black-faced into the pantry

  instinctively i slammed the door upon
my assailants falling against it with a


the railroad mans magazine

sob of joy my knees shook under
me my whole body heaved in a desper-
ate fight for air-but  knew that i was
safe the click that came to my ringing
ears as the door closed told the story
the closet was a trap rocca and his
man were my prisoners

  from within came a series of thuds
as of heavy bodies hurled against the
door but the faint sounds were strangely
muffled as i listened more of the truth
dawned upon me once within that
closet i could have screamed until the
day of judgment and no sound would
have penetrated the deadened walls

  possibly they had meant to suffocate
me there possibly there was a trap-door
another entrance something-heaven
knows what whatever it was they had
prepared for me they would have to
face it themselves

  it was a convenient apartment-very
roccas words came back to me as i
gasped for breath against the door it
had come close to- being too convenient
for me but now  was master of it
slowly my strength returned and at last
 moved away to examine my conquest

  save for the prison-closet it was an
ordinary new york apartment of the
most expensive class the furnishings
were more than ordinarily luxurious it
is true but except for their cost there
was nothing noteworthy about them
from one room to another i wandered
secure in my conviction that my two as-
sailants were harmless reluctant to sum-
mon the police until i had learned all
that the home of the  chief  revealed

  in a small den off the sitting-room
which i took to be roccas private sanc-
tum i found a roll-top desk it was
locked but i tugged and pulled and
beat upon it without compunction until
the lock was forced they had tried to
kidnap the girl i loved they had tried
to lure me to an unknown fate in this
web of iniquity i had no qualms of
conscience in thus forcing my unwel-
come way into their secrets

  on the top of the desk in plain sight
as the cover rolled back were two maps
and a bundle of formidable legal docu-
ments lying there as though their owner
had been too pressed for time to deposit
them in their proper resting-places the
familiar and detested word  abyssinia

caught my eye and i thrust the maps
into my pocket

  though still unexplained i was con-
vinced that there was some connection
between that far-off wilderness and my
own adventures a little documentary
evidence would do no- harm the legal
papers were in italian i did not stop to
decipher them but they too joined the
maps for safe keeping in my pocket

  then deliberately and systematically
i sat down to examine the contents of
the desk under my hand avas a scrap
of paper with a few figures on it it
was nothing but an address f w 
but my lips whistled with satisfaction
as i looked at it it was the address of
mrs noyes rocca must have written
it down on his return from that fatal
drive with me

  it was the concluding touch of proof
maria had not reviled me stephen pa-
get but the man she had seen in roccas
company well that was settled he
would tnever see me there again

  i ran through the contents of the desk
emptying drawer after drawer search-
ing for i knew not what the papers
i dragged into the light were nothing to
me-mere lists of names and street num-
bers occasionally columns of figures
that evidently represented sums of
money documents written in an italian
hand that it would have taken me hours
to translate ard might perhaps have re-
sisted all my efforts for the little that
i did read conveyed no meaning to my
mind and i met with strange combina-
tions of letters never encountered in
print

  one thing however encouraged me
to persist on a separate piece of paper
standing out clear on the white surface
i read the words pietro bigontina-
 barent-x there was nothing
else on the sheet but somehow i gath-
ered the impression that it was of im-
portance to the owner of the desk

  to me it meant but one thing the
missing boy was or at one time had
been at the warehouse to which i had
driven and to which rocca had so cor-
dially invited me for the second time

  the paper joined the maps and the
legal documents in my pocket as i bent
once more to my task then suddenly
 sprang from the disordered desk
the spider

of palermo



startled by the sudden buzzing of the
door-bell again it rang and now my
straining ears caught the sound from the
hallway beyond the murmur of voices

  my visitors were impatient for th
third time the bell sounded and  smiled
grimly they could ring through the
afternoon and they would not disturb
victor in his muffled closet no sleek
deferential servlng-man would bow be-
fore them as the scoundrel had bowed
befre me	

  the smile died abruptly who knew
what secret exits there might be to that
prison into which i had thrust rocca
and his servant while i was poring
in fatuous satisfaction over his papers
who knew what that all-powerful ser-
pent had been doing i had been a con-
ceited fool and if i was not quick i
might have to pay heavily for my folly

  the bell clamored more loudly than
ever as i dashed to the telephone if
they kept that up i would have the po-
lice upon them while they were still
pressing the button with frantic energy
my land was on the receiver but i jerked
it back the bell had ceased to ring
and from the hallway came a new sound
-the sound of a key being thrust into a
lock

  it flashed over mg in a second  a
friend  had secured the apartment for
rocca he was the chief  and the
friend probably one of his lieutenants
whom he had ousted from his quarters
out of respect for his master the friend
had been ringing now satisfied that
something was wrong he was letting
himself in with his own key nd i was
caught-

  while i stood arguing with the lazy
clerk at police headquarters they would
be upon me much chance i would have
with my back turned to them talking in-
to the impassive telephone

  it takes long to tell it it did not take
long to think it the key was still rat-
tling in the lock when i was back beside
the door twice i had saved myself
by superior speed and it was speed on
which i would rely now

  the key turned the door swung open
a head was thrust cautiously forward as
though its owner hesitated to intrude
upon sacred precincts that misplaced
reverence was a godsend overlooking

    	r r

me as i crouched by the side of the door
the eyes were still searching the deserted
calm of the apartment when i struck
my fist crunched against the head the
head against the wooden door and then
i charged

  how many of them there were i did
not know-i have never known my
fists shot out again and again to land on
soft yielding flesh futile surprised
blows fell upon me in return and i was
through them-through save for one
man in the rear of his companions
ghedina stood blocking my retreat i
pitched into him headlong and the little
man went down with me on top of him

  for such an onslaught he had been no
more prepared than the others he
struck feebly at me a walking-stick
clutched in his hand but if the blow
landed it did no damage with one
hand i caught his wrist and with the
other i struck savagely at the evil face
the stick dropped from his hand and
clattered down the stairs as i sprang
after it clear and free

  a few steps below me lay the cane
and i stooped to seize it as i ran a
bullet whistled past my lowered head
and sank into the wainscoting

  on the corner a blue-clad giant raised
his hand and the hurrying traffic of the
avenue halted for a second i gaped
at him an unspoken cry for help trem-
bling on my lips he was the police he
was the law and he spent his day in
regulating trucks and broughams vic-
torias and hansoms while men were mur-
dered and women stolen ten doors from
him

  my mouth opened but the call did not
come ghedina and his  friends were
in the apartment now the door of the
prison open rocca free to summon
the police was to involve oneself in end-
less legal technicalities-and all the
time maria was exposed her refuge
known and open

chapter xvii
a new use for a telephone

the policeman i left to blow his
whistle and wave his hand undis-
turbed a new scheme had come to me
startling in the vision of brilliant tri-


the railroad mans magazine

umph daring and yet too rich in possi-
bilities lo lie flung aside as foolhardy

  fascinated by it i stood for a minute
staring at the stick in my hand my mind
leaping over the difficulties in the path
to the dazzling reward the vision was
too bright for me to turn my back upon

  mrs noyes herself answered my call
from the nearest telephone-booth

  yesthis is stephen i found my-
self speaking quite calmly even slowly
though my heart was jumping with ex-
citement  ive found out some things
cousin lucy ill tell you what they are
later now  want you to do exactly as
i say

  yes yes i know you do but this
is very important dont go out of the
house yourself and dont let anybody
in on any pretext-no gas-men or tele-
phone-men or anybody oh its all
right cousin lucy--dont worry i
cant explain over the telephone im in
a hurry anyway yes ill sec you very
soon good-by

   i hung up the receiver with the feeling
of one who has burned his bridges be-
hind him that was attended to now
for marshfield his house was but a
short distance away and i went there as
fast as a cabman dared to drive through
crowded streets

  dave was at home-the most unlikely
place to find a new york man in early
alternoon but he was a law unto him-
self and he was there

   i want you- i cried as he answered
the footmans summons in person come
on

   but i have something-

   cut it theres no time to talk
come

  davids eye rested on my excited face
for a fraction of a second before he
reached for his hat deliberately he se-
lected a heavy stick from the rack while
the astonished servant held his coat -

   after you he said as the man
opened the door and then we were out-
side it had taken less than ten minutes
to get david time was precious but
his company was worth more than that

   seventy-eight barent street i
called to the cabby  and drive fast

  a shrill whistle came from marshfield
already seated in the cab  what is it
steve  he demanded as the drivers

whip curled over our heads and we started
on our journey

   rocca tried to take me there after
you left he didnt know that i had ever
heard of the place when  wouldnt
come he tried to fix me in some sort of
a trap hes got there i put him in in-
stead and got this  - i held up the
slender yellow walking-stick with its
round silver top curiously hammered

   you remember the musician said he
knew them by their sticks this is one
of them well get into the warehouse
with it the boy pietro is there well
get him out ill bring him back to ma-
ria

  the short sentences told the story
clearly enough marshfields eyes light-
ed at the sheer audacity of the thing and
his hand gripped my knee in rare ex-
citement

   well do it by heaven well do
it  he cried suddenly his grip relaxed
and a smile softened the firm mouth
  well get him out ill bring him
back to maria  he quoted  where
do i come in -paget

   you come in as the best friend a man
ever had i cried  i wouldnt ask it
of you for myself its for her dave-
its for her i tell you

   oh thats all right marshfield
growled with obvious embarrassment
 leave the sentiment until theres noth-
ing else to talk about when were
through with this ill call in state and
congratulate you both what do you
propose to do down here 

   heaven knows i answered  its
a big bluff thats all well go as far as
we can and when were stopped well
wave the stick at them

    and then i guess well fight retort-
ed marshfield  you ought to be good
at it by this time youve had practise
enough

  we planned no further for there was
nothing to plan truly it was all a
bluff and in the light of davids cool
vision another fight did seem to be all
that we would gain by it but as
marshfield had said i was used to fight-
ing with them hitherto i had won and
this time i had david with me we
would w in again if it came to that and
there was joy in the thought that we went
to strike in marias cause
the spider

of palermo

g

  david seemed to read my thoughts
for his cool tones broke into them as
ve reached the spot where i had over-
thrown the cabman

   do you happen to know whether you
are a lancelot or a quixote in other
words are you a hero or a fool oh
dont look at me like that-im not half
as crazy as you are what i mean is
how do you know this young cub wants
to be rescued  

   hes her brother i gasped this
view of the case had not presented itself
to me for a long time

  oh then youre in love with the
whole family thats very nice

   confound you what do you mean 
i cried hotly too jealous of my new love
to remember how ineradicable was david
marshfields affection for a jest he
viewed the world through the glasses of
his humor and it was inevitable that his
language should reflect the spectacle

  he had spoken as he would have had
we been driving to the sedatest of din-
ner-parties  but when he saw that he had
touched me his tone changed

   pardon me steve he said a wealth
of affection in the quiet words  but
really now how do we know that this
pietro isnt playing some kind of a weird
game from all accounts everybody
else in the party is-except his sister of
course he added hastily

   thats the whole thing-except his
sister we dont know i went on
thoughtfully  but we can guess from
what weve heard im sure of it ive
heard them talk about having the boy
and wanting the girl now well the
girl doesnt want to go why should the
boy

   i guess youre right anyway well
rescue him first and talk about it after-
ward

  it was all very well to speak of the
rescue with sublime confidence in its com-
ing to david the expedition was a
game-a more exciting game than any he
had yet played but still a game-in which
the stakes were his life and the prize help
to his friend and for himself the joy of
conflict and danger 

  barent street in the daytime was a far
different place from the deserted rain-
swept solitude i had driven through be-
fore trucks jolted along with deafen-

ing clatter the narrow sidewalks were
blocked with packing - cases and hurry-
ing men the warehouses which had risen
silently into the niiht were teeming with
life and noise now - and seventy-eight
had awakened with its neighbors

  just what we had expected i do not
know but it was certainly not this we
had come prepared to storm a citadel of
crime and we found ourselves in a place
devoted to prosaic business with no busi-
ness of our own to explain our presence

  for the moment it seemed that our
journey was to end in a humiliating dis-
missal on the ground that we were wast-
ing the time of busy men

  the cab drew up in front of the door
from which i had seen cagno emerge
and we descended a shabby individual
armed with no more formidable weapon
than a broom paused in his task of rais-
ing clouds of dust about his head long
enough toask us in broken english what
we wanted

  what did we want  i looked helpless-
ly at him and was silent

  had he halted me with a revolver i
would have thrust the magic stick in front
of him or risked the accuracy of his aim
in a sudden rush but he was nothing
more than a humble hireling sweeping
out the hall in front of a warehouse of-
fice i looked at his simple stolid face
and thrust the stick behind my back

   what you want   he demanded
again

  there was nothing suspicious about the
question it was exactly what every one
of the thousands of ignorant immigrants
in the city would have said under similar
circumstances

  marshfield recovered himself first

   lemons  he muttered his head
thrown back as he sniffed the heavy odor
of the place  its lemons

   eh-what  asked the sweeper star-
ing with dull eyes from one to the other
of us  what do you want 

  his command of english it seemed
did not extend beyond that phrase

   we want lemons declared marsh-
field with a solemn face  wheres the
manager of this place

  the fellow pointed with the handle of
his broom to the dirty ground-glass of a
door behind him on which the letters f
and e remained to indicate that it had
the railroad mans magazine

once been labeled office then satisfied
that he had done all that was required of
him he went on with his sweeping

  we pushed open the door and walked
in unannounced

  crouched over a desk in the corner
an ill - favored cigar smoldering in his
mouth was an individual in shirt-sleeves
and a gaudy waistcoat coarse close-
cropped hair stood up like black stubble
on his bullet head  a thick neck reached
down to sloping shoulders and a flabby
frame

  the only other occupant of the room
was an insignificant young man perched
on a high stool with one enormous ledger
in front of him another by his side and
a vast number of papers stuck on a cluster
of spikes about him

  the man at the desk looked up at our
entrance took the cigar from his lips
and growled an inarticulate and surly
greeting

  in return marshfield beamed upon
him

   business looks good he said af-
fably

   huh  fair the grunt was scarce-
ly more distinguishable than the previous
growl of welcome but t made out two
things from it first that the man had not
spoken english from his cradle and
second that missing teeth and a scarred
lip made speech of any sort difficult to
him

  prices pretty high continued
marshfield

   not so very what do you want

   lemons said david shortly he
knocked a dirt-covered newspaper from
the broken cane seat of a disreputable
chair pulled it close to the desk and sat
down you sell them dont you he
asked as the round eyes of the man in
front of us protruded and the sweeping
mustache bristled upward at his visitors
assurance

   its no corner grocery retorted the
fellow

   i know it isnt davids manner
changed abruptly  look here friend
are you in the fruit business or are you
not we havent got the whole day to
waste here you know

   cant you see im in the business
what do you think all these trucks are
doing 

   well why dont you talk business
then  retorted marshfield  i want to
buy some lemons

   you ought to go to the office 
stone street this is only a warehouse
there was still to put it mildly noth-
ing gracious about the man but there was
at least some interest in his voice either
he was telling the truth and rude merely
because a lifetime spent in wrangling
with truck-drivers does not teach cour-
tesy or else he had decided that for the
sake of appearances he must assume some
attention to our mission

  gradually he permitted himself to be
persuaded that he could further the in-
terests of the continental fruit-and im-
port company by listening to us and he
and marshfield were soon deep in a dis-
cussion of the intricacies of shipping a
car-load of lemons to cincinnati

  taking advantage of his superiors ab-
sorption the young man with the ledgers
slipped down from his stool and marched
out into the courtyard on some errand of
his own we were alone with the man-
ager-and as far from pietro bigontina
as when we started

  marshfield was nearing the end of his
rope in a minute or two more he would
either have to close the deal or reject it
in either case he would have  further
excuse for lingering in the office and
where we were to go when we left was
beyond my power to perceive the very
commonplaceuess of the den was for us
the most impenetrable of barriers any
door however strongly guarded would
have been easier to pass than this dead
blank wall of insignificance

  for a minute i was tempted to seize
the manager by his fat neck and choke
the truth out of him but i began to
doubt if the truth was there he looked
like the very vulgar superintendent of a
warehouse and it was quite possible that
that was exactly what he was

   i will think it over marshfield was
saying when the telephone interrupted
him the manager thrust his injured lips
to the instrument to growl in his indis-
tinct voice

   hallo hallo who is it why
dont you speak louder i cant hear
you- say ah si si signore he
was speaking italian now and had evi-
dently recognized the other  no
the spider of palermo



signore nothing out of the ordinary it
has been quiet  am listening signor
cagno

  he did not listen long if it was
cagno who was talking i proposed to
have him talk to me the last word had
barely left the mans lip when my two
hands shot out and the fingers fastened
in the soft flesh of the red tljxoat the
receiver dropped to the desk there was a
deep gurgle and the thing was done

  jerking the helpless lump from the
chair i flung him heavily on the floor

   marshfield fell upon him before the
wretch had time to scream and i picked
up the receiver from the torrent of vol-
uble and profane italian which flowed
into my ear i gathered that signor cagno
was anxious to know what all the row

	was about and why wlien he condescend-
ed to talk various kinds of pigs and
scoundrels did not listen to him

   i was very sorry a drunken teamster
had interrupted me at a most inopportune
moment it was annoying but signor
cagno knew the cattle one had to deal
with in barent street would he be so
good as to repeat what he had been say-
ing

   the sole reason that my voice sounded
peculiar to him was the atrocity of the
connection also signor cagno was
aware that i had the misfortune to be
afflicted with an accident to the mouth
if it disturbed him it was a thousand
pities but i regretted that i knew of no
remedy

   all this i mumbled into the receiver
in a voice as much like the indistinct
rumblings of my victim as i could con-
trive to make it while davids relent-
less knee and fingers held the manager
silent though squirming on the floor
my verbose apologies stopped the flood
of abuse still angry but somewhat re-
strained now cagnos words came to me

   let it pass this time in future i
want more attention when i speak
now listen you will tell antonio that
the goods on the top floor are to be
shipped by the rear door at four-thirty
exactly do you understand

    i am afraid that i do not it was
the most truthful thing that either
marshfield or i had said since we en-
tered the precincts of the warehouse
what are the goods

  a wild splutter of rage was my an-
swer when its first violence was spent
i heard the scoundrels voice shrieking
 what is it to you what they are
who are you to ask questions do as
you are told or you will suffer for it
you know antonio-tell him what i say
and mind you dont talk to any stran-
gers and dont listen to any fine
schemes the man who blunders this
time will pay for it

   the receiver at the other end of the
wire was hung up cagno had given
his orders and was through with me
on the floor by the desk marshfield put
a little more of his weight upon the
crushed form of the manager as he
looked up at me

    did you learn anything he asked

chapter xviii
the goods on the top floor

comething i had learned the
 goods  were on the top floor
they could be no mere boxes of lemons
there was more than a fair chance that
they were the missing pietro who
antonio was as yet we had not discov-
ered but the efficacy of the walking-
stick was - still untested

   in the meantime there was the flabby
wretch on the floor the moment marsh-
fields grip upon him relaxed his
screams- would bring the whole horde
about our ears like bees from an over-
turned hive david was looking at me
inquiringly but no inspiration came to
me from the swollen choking face
pinned down in the dust of the office

   well said my friend at last

  what is it to be 

    i dont know i muttered  weve
got to find a man named antonio but
what are we to do with this   and i
pointed to the sprawling manager

    take him with us suggested david
with a sudden chuckle we came to
buy lemons i guess hes the stuff all
right

    he wont come i replied a little
doubtfully for the project was not al-
together impossible

   we havent asked him yet you
will come wont you marshfield
turned back to his captive with a tight-


the railroad mans magazine

 ening of his fingers and a fierce snarl
 that boded no good to the unfortunate
 rascal david could act as well as joke

  no answer was ever given to his cor-
dial invitation before the manager
could chi more than gasp and sputter
the ofiice-door opened and the young
clerk entered he was well on his un-
obtrusive way toward his place in front
of the ledgers before he noticed anything
unusual about the dreary den then he
fell against the high desk his thin face
a dead white his hands spread out as
though to ward off a blow

   great heavens  he gasped
great heavens

  i blocked him as he sprang in tardy
panic for the door

   you keep still i ordered sharply
 or it will be the worse for you

  it was no fighter whom i faced down
so easily long hours of weary drudg-
ery on a high stool had not reddened
his blood or steeled his nerves i was
a more powerful man than he and the
knowledge of it was to be read clearly
in the panic-stricken eye fastened on me
for a moment i menaced him in si-
lence and then sheer childish fright
forced him to cry out

   what is it we havent any money
 shut up we dont want your
money were the police

  it was a happy inspiration born of
the boys terror if he continued to
think he was about to be murdered he
might take it into his head to indulge
in a death-scream that would ruin
everything if he imagined it was the
hand of the law that held him he
would i hoped seek refuge in abject
obedience

  but the effect was greater than i had
anticipated with a gasp of dismay he
shrank away from me his lips twitching

   the police  he moaned  i
knew it i said there was something
queer about the place but i havent
done anything his voice rose in shrill
protest  i havent done anything i
tell you im only a clerk here i dont
know anything about them its no
crime to make a living what could i
do  where-

   you shut up my savage order
checked the loud quavering appeals
which threatened to pierce the grimy

windowsof the offices and penetrate into
the turmoil of the court  nobodys
going to hurt you-not yet that is do
you know who antonio is

   theres a man named antonio up-
stairs but i dont know i say im
only the shipping-clerk i havent-
how do you get up marshfield
interrupted curtly from his post on the
prostrate manager

   theres a freight-elevator behind
there they never let me go up i-
 give me that cord steve

  with a nod of his head david indi-
cated some heavy twine under the desk
then whipping out his handkerchief he
jammed it into his victims mouth rolled
the miserable wretch over on his back
and tied his hands with the cord i hand-
ed to him

 now -he rose with a sigh of re-
lief- now liell stay quiet for a while
in the meantime we can go up-stairs
instinctively i started toward the
door to be stopped by a new thought

   what are we going to do with
him i asked pointing to the terrified
youth by the desk

   use him retorted marshfield swift-
ly  look here you  he strode over
to the boy like the personification of
avenging justice  you say you dont
know anything about this business
thats a pretty fishy story do you want
to spend the night in the police sta-
tion 

  a shudder passed over the clerks
slight frame and his chin twitched as
the pitiful figure rises before my eves
again i am convinced that he was be-
deviled with the horror of scandal and
disgrace rather than by actual physical
fear of what marshfield or i might do
to him

  quite likely he had a family skilled
in the art of arranging unpleasant do-
mestic scenes possibly he fancied him-
self in love and was appalled at the
thought of the intervention of the police
in his suit at any rate i have never
been able to persuade myself that he had
any guilty knowledge of the secrets of
the warehouse and i know that he was
as clay in marshfields rough hands

  you dont care about it eh
david glared at him with a protruding
jaw and a frown that woxdd have done
the spider of palermo



credit to his fathers sternest moments
 well well give you a chance if
you make good you may square yourself
yet you stay here dont you let any-
body in tell them the boss is out if
the boss moves kick him till he keeps
quiet come steve

  with a farewell scowl david turned
on his heel the office-door closed upon
us and we were in the hallways once
more the sweeper and his rubbish had
advanced into the court the road lay
open

  far back in the freight-strewn dimly
lighted recesses of the warehouse we
found the elevator a stolid surly por-
ter lounging against a packing-case
looked at us in some surprise as we burst
in upon his leisurely pipe but he fol-
lowed us into the heavy car and started
the machinery without objection

  past two floors we went in silence
at the third he stretched out his hand
and stopped the car without vouchsafing
any explanation a glance upward into
the gloomy tunnel of the shaft showed
that we had not reached the top

   go on cried marshfield  what
are you stopping here for

  the porter simply pointed at the
empty floor in front of us

   go on ordered marshfield more
peremptorily this time  we want to
go to the top

   no go more

  it was as though a statue had spoken
no change came over the wooden face
in front of us  there was no expression
in his voice  the man merely stood and
pointed as if there were no question
but that we must go

   you take- david tpok an angry
step toward the fellow and the sentence
died on his lips the wooden statue
had sprung into life from the corner
of the car half crouched like a beast
about to spring he glared at us and in
his hand was a long knife

   the deuce  marshfield measured
the distance with the trained eye of the
boxer and stopped his fist could not
reach the man and fists against knives
was poor business at best what he
would have done i do not know-david
was no lover of diplomatic retreats-
for while the two faced each other i
stepped forward

  do you see that i cried in ital-
ian thrusting ghedinas stick almost
into the mans face  do you see that
imbecile take us to antonio

  the porter stared at the hammered
silver head of the cane and the knife
dropped to his side it would have been
an easy matter for us to have rushed
him then in the first moment of his sur-
prise  and david i know was sorely
tempted luckily he stood motionless
the stick was more powerful than our
fists

   from the cane the man raised his eyes
to me   do not know he muttered
stupidly  i do not know

   of course you dont know who
are you to know pig are we to stand
talking to you take us to antonio
i had heard cagno talk too recently
not to have caught something of his
manner and there was no ingratiating
politeness in my speech if abuse was
the diet these men were accustomed to
my italian vocabulary was extensive
enough to give it to them

  my method was successful with a
rough growl of apology the porter
reached past marshfields grim face and
grasped the ropes of the freight-ele-
vator  i never saw the signorehe
muttered as the car started upward  
had my orders

  the car stopped at the next landing
and he stepped out on the top floor of
the warehouse in tense excitement
marshfield and i followed him only to
choke back our disappointment there
was nothing here under the sloping
walls of the roof a few cases were re-
vealed in the dim rays from a dirt-en-
crusted skylight above in the wall over-
looking the yard a wooden door closed
a large opening which had been cut for
the admission of such wares as did not
come as we had by the elevator

   a few paces along the floor our guide
stopped to whistle shrilly in the shad-
ows beyond him we heard a door open
and the figure of a man advanced toward
us he exchanged a word or two in an
undertone with the porter and then the
two of them turned back to where we
stood by the elevator

    antonio signore was the brief in-
troduction

  the newcomer peered at us under


the railroad mans magazine

heavy brows a squarely built stocky
figure of a man whose strength lost noth-
ing by being only indistinctly suggested
in the scanty light we studied each
other for a second before i spoke in cold
command

    you are to ship the goods at once
by the rear way we will go with
them

   who are you signore  the
mans tone was respectful but as firm
as mine

   that is nothing to you you see
this i raised the wizards wand i had
won from ghedina

    si signore but the orders were to
 come from signor cagno

    there are others higher than signor
 cagno we have changed our minds
 come you have your orders-

   with marshfield by my side i stepped
 with an assurance that it was difficult to
 feel past the man and down toward the
 door from which he had emerged my
 back was cold in anticipation of the
 knife-thrust i more than half-expected
 but it did not come only a few hurried
 whispered sentences and then

  it is right there was no warning
from the office and i was told to be
ready

   antonio slipped past us to fling open
 a door in our path as the elevator
 creaked its way down to the bottom floor
 before us was a small room furnished
 with a range some kitchen utensils and
 a cot-bed another door led from it
 and at this antonio paused

   will the sign or  see him or shall i
 prepare him to leave he asked

   we will see him and without
further ado i pushed open the door
antonio unlocked and walked in

   it was the prison of pietro bigontina
 no second glance was needed to tell us
 that we had reached our goal at last
 the slender boy of eighteen who turned
 from the window at our entrance to face
 us with dark eyes gleaming from a pale
 and suffering face was marias brother
 there were the same clear-cut features
 the same sensitive mouth the same
 rounded chin only- well what is
 delicacy in a girl may be weakness in a
 boy and pietro bigontina unaided was
 hardly the man to fight his way clear of
 such enemies as his

  there was a frightened defiance in his
eyes as he faced us that went to our
hearts but neither david nor i dared to
reassure him we must play our parts
a minute or two longer  if we played
them well we could afford to indulge
in sympathy hereafter

   you must come with us i ordered
 and at once

   i will not the boys voice was
shrill with hate and helplessness  i
will not

  eh it was more like the growl
of a bulldog than the mild voice of
david marshfield and involuntarily i
jumped as i heard it justly doubtful
of his italian david had refrained from
speech after his unsatisfactory inter-
view in english with the porter in the
elevator now with the wonderful per-
ception that was like a sixth sense with
him he took from my shoulders the bur-
den of bullying the brother of the girl i
loved

   eh  the word might have been
italian or english or ancient sanskrit
flung at him with all the browbreating
violence that hadmade the elder marsh-
field wealthy it came to the wretched
pietro like the signal of his doom the
captive wilted as the clerk had wilted
what was more important the last trace
of suspicion vanished from the jail-
ers brutal face as he watched but
marshfield was after all only a dumb
terror and i was forced to the front
again

	 the rear way antonio-show it
to us

  si signore but do you care for
this he stepped back into the
kitchen to emerge in a second with a
small bottle and a napkin  it keeps
them quiet he remarked with an evil
grin

   it might certainly the sight of it did
not a cry broke from the boys lips
and he leaped into the corner of the
little room as far as he could get from
the abomination sick with the knowl-
edge of what it all meant unnerved by
the horror of that scream i yet had
presence of mind enough to turn upon
him with an oath

  none of that silence put that
down antonio he will come quietly
without it show us the way
the spider of palermo



  as docile now as though i had been
rocca himself the ruffian restored the
drug to its resting-place taking up in-
stead a slouch - hat this he jammed
on the boys head pulling it low over
the twitching face then we were ready
to leave the den of iniquity

  the rear way it appeared was a
spiral iron staircase winding down
through the gloom of the warehouse and
closed  the top floor by an iron door
which antonio unlocked with one of a
bundle of keys he drew from his pocket

i had already begun the descent and
marshfield was pushing pietro after me
when a sudden noise checked us ab-
ruptly

  it was the warning whistle which had
produced antonio for our benefit a min-
ute or two before through the echoes
which broke the dusty silence of the
isolated floor we heard the creaking of
the elevator close at hand

  david reached out a powerful hand
and grasped the jailer by the wrist that
held the keys  come he ordered in
gruff italian and pointed down the
winding stair antonios feet braced
like the legs of a stubborn donkey as
he stood in the little doorway his head
turned to listen

  i the stillness there rang out the
shrill voice of ghedina care an-
tonio care

  marshfields hand was already upon
the italians wrist at the first word
he bent it viciously backward and a
howl of pain mingled with the last of
ghedinas warning cry a twist of his
foot and a thrust of his arm completed
the work and i heard him shout

  run for it steve

  the slight weight of pietro fell
against me as marshfield shoved him
down the stairs and then i ran be-
hind me- i heard the panting of our res-
cued prisoner the heavy steps of my
friend and a chaos of shouts and curses
the stairs seemed interminable as i
leaped on through the gloom till my
head was dizzy with the sharp turning
and the dark world swimming about me

  i came to the bottom at last-and
the bottom was a locked door for a
moment i beat upon it with my naked
hands the hot breath of pietro upon

to be co

my neck then i was thrust aside and
davids voice hoarse with his running

  came to me

  where the deuce is the thing

ah 

   a flood of sunlight burst upon us as
he flung open the door scarcely ten
feet away waiting in a narrow alley
was a closed carriage and behind us
as  glanced back i saw the shadow of
the foremost of our pursuers

   with a cry pietro sprang out into
the daylight davids hand closed upon
his collar in a second but i saw 
more jerking the keys from the lock
into which marshfield had thrust them

 i slammed the solid door in the face of
 the ruffian who was almost on me held
 it with my weight for a second and
 heard the bolt snap into place as i
 turned the key on the outside

    west eleventh street i ordered
and the words reached the driver above
the thud of men throwing themselves
against the locked door  west elev-
enth street  cried again for the
coachman was motionless in surprise

 cant you see there is no time to
waste 

   apparently he saw for the door had
not yet closed after me when the car-
riage dashed out of the alley and was
speeding northward marshfields hands
left the boy and rose to mop the per-
spiration from his streaming face

    infernally lucky i got those keys
 he panted  how about it bigontina
 you understand english eh

   pietros big eyes fastened themselves
  the face of his new captor

    a little he gasped  you are not
 one of them

  not by a darned sight davids
laugh of sheer triumph seemed to blow
from us the last clouds of danger you
tell him about it steve its your turn
now i told you the sentiment would
come after the fighting

  he was wrong there to my first 
hurried sentences of explanation the boy
listened in vague bewilderment but to
no more she is safe i am free he
repeated over and over in absolute ex-
haustion until out of pity i desisted
he was free but as we were soon to
learn maria was not safe
ntinued
the railroad mans
brain teasers

 here are three hard nuts to crack during the cold
 winter nights boys and perhaps you can send
 us some that are equally as good

 hen we closed the puzzle department some
 months ago we feared that the puzzle
 ground was pretty well worked over we
 are still waiting to find out whether this
 is true or not and hoping it is not in
 the meantime we are indebted to mr a k sedson of
 north pomfret vermont for the two that follow

     	when in action which moves fastest the top or
 the bottom of a locomotives drive-wheels

      	two trains of equal tonnage and an equal capacity
 for starting eighty loaded cars and not one pound more
 are connected tender to tender by means of a link capable
 of sustaining the strain of starting eighty cars and not one
 pound more the engines are started at full capacity in
 opposite directions will the link stand the strain

      of a similar nature to the first of these puzzles is one
 forwarded by mr it f brown of chattanooga tennessee

      given a spot in the rim of a five-foot driving-wheel
 touching the rail at each revolution how far will the spot
 travel while the locomotive is traveling one hundred miles

     we await solutions from our mathematically inclined
 readers j
on the editorial carpet

     well heres looking at you boys and wishing
     you a merry christmas and a happy new year

a happy new year

next month is the time of resolu-
tions new leaves and good inten-
tions it is the time when we send our
consciences to the shop for an overhauling
-and usually we find that they have been
drawing a load twice as high as their ra-
ting that the cylinders need packing that
the tubes are leaking that the bell is
cracked the headlight smoky and tiie draw-
bar so confoundedly strained that nothing
but a new year has saved us from being
ditched on a down grade	e

  and then the remarkable thing is the
comfortable amount of credit we take to
ourselves for sending this leaky old tea-
kettle of a conscience to be jacked up and
repaired

  just because it hasnt actually blown up
or smashed a side-rod and sent us under a
tombstone we patronize it like a poor re-
lation and think how good we are to take
a look at it at all

  it will of course be clearly understood
that we are not now speaking of the edi-
torial conscience that is the one infat-
lible well-oiled high-pressure piece of
machinery that always behaves itself be-
cause it is constantly attended to

  when we dont attend to it ourselves
our readers do it for us and when our
readers set the sand running you bet the
editorial conscience gets such a grip on
the rails that its a wonder the track
doesnt curl up behind us

  for us new year comes every month
and we believe- that the good intentions
announced monthly in this department are
usually lived up to judging from the letters
we get from our friends

  the headline of this item has probably
led you to believe that we are going to
wish you a happy new year so having
got off our little reminder of good resolu-
tions and consciences we will proceed not
only to wish for you but promise to do
our best to insure for vou a happy
new year

  we could if we would tell you of many
good things for the new year but we

like to be conservative in our promises
and liberal in our gifts

  still we would just like to assure you
that there isnt going to be any need for
a pusher on even the steepest grade we
are going to climb them all at the same
spd we have kept up from the first

  weve got a tender full of anthracite
and water and we are not on any short
allowance of oil so we dont hesitate to
sar that we can give you as smooth a
run as you can desire

  true we very rarely use the brake but
we are always under control nevertheless
and the reason we never set the brakes is
that we have a clear track and no cross-
ings

  perhaps it strikes you that we are a
little early with our new year wishes as
we have not yet wished you a merry christ-
mas

   right in front of this are  pages wish-
ing you that in every line and following it
are  pages that are waiting around the
corner to carry out the sentiment that heads
this item

  take for instance the january number
which led us to think of the new year in
that number  the spider of palermo
draws to a thrilling climax which should
not be missed by any reader

  we dont remember that we ever had a
story that made a better finish at the end
of a long run than this one shes just
as strong and fresh hot at the boiler and
cool at the bearings as she has been
throughout and it seems a shame to send
her to the roundhouse

  mr stones heroes and heroine in the
daughter of the idol  continue to have a
strenuous time of it while the treasure
of the world  and  the dam-builders 
have absolutely no high joints and low cen-
ters	

  in the way of short stories we have a
screamingly funny yarn by our new friend

e	florence who has delighted us with his
pleasing impossibilities in the november
number and in the present issue it is en-
titled  what did dugan do to him   a
story called  the disappearing diamonds 

i
	the railroad

will also catch your funny streak as will
the telegraphic twins then there is
another yarn which is as funny as a fire-
man in a uniform it is by a new writer

f	h richardson

  other stories of a more serious nature
will be along to keep the risible journals
cool and they are just as valuable to us
in helping us push our pilot over the ties
at full speed

  in the line of specials we have a true
story about a race with the sunset limited
if wc are not mistaken you will feel the
throttle lever in the palm of one hand
and the brake lever in the palm of the
other and youll see the ties skipping
underneath you and being swallowed by
the train all the time you are reading this
story

  mr herr will continue to tell-of his ex-
periences while  being a boomer brake-
man and mr smith and mr willets need
neither introduction nor explanation here

  another hummer we shall probably run
is a true story of how a flyer made up lost
time we should like to tell you more
about this story but after thinking of  the

two new poets

with more than usual pride we intro-
duce to our readers through this
months carpel two new poets-singers of
the rail who know whereof they sing none
of your hifalutin kiplingese but just
the plain simple song of the man who has
lived the part the first is james a
crowell atlanta georgia his verse is
dedicated to the knight of the key whom
we all familiarly know as a  ham

oh you ham

       out in a lonely office

      before the break of day

      a ham lay snoozing gently

      a getting good old hay

      he lay upon the table

      as just as good as dead

      for he never heard a single word
      the clicking sounders said

chorus

      he was in a better land-

      a land all clear and bright

      and there he had a day job

      for they didnt have no night

mans magazine

    only one train ran a day

    his pay was but a gift

for this here solitary train
ran on the other shift

   the despatcher he was- swearing-

as all despatchers do-

   for number nine was waiting
   for the block to go on through

   the ham he kept on snoring

    his job he couldnt shirk-

    for he was in that sunny land
    where he didnt have to work

chorus

   hark number nine is whistling

she wants to go on by

    she has ten cars of perishable
    and fourteen cars of rye

   the ham awoke and looked around

and spied the waiting train

just then he heard the sounder

you are discharged again

chorus

 

the second poet is roy l nichols of
the oregon railroad and navigation
company his like mr crowells was
evidently inspired by that wanderlust classic
 the dying hobo mr nichols modestly
informs us that this is his first and last ef-
fort as a fall poet but that he may write an-
other next spring we like to encourage ge-
nius when it swings onto our right-of-way
and if any poems by mr nichols comes our
way next grass we will certainly put the
arm against them here is mr nicholss
poem

twenty years ago

beside a western water-tank

   one cold november day

outside an empty pigpen-car

   a drunken hobo lay

no pardner stood beside him

    but he heard a warrant read

and listening to all the words

    the drunken hobo said

 marshal please go and let me sleep

for im now feeling right

i have been trying for so long

and now im good and tight

tell your chief and policemen many

when they meet to  look around

that you found me  on the level-

i was lying on the ground

 i want to dream of sweethearts many-
and one whose face no more ill view
for  left her out in denver

and im glad that i came through

i know shell not weep for me

nor sob with drooping head

for i was aye a truant bird
while by others she was fed

 i used to call her sweetheart

she was such a buxom kid

she had eyes just like a sappho

anri shed never bat  lid 
on the editorial carpet

her form was sylphlike-ways confiding
  face like artists love to paint-

just one more drink bartender

  for i think im goingto faint

 ah  the memory of that female

  with her face so good and true

what you think that i am nutty
  that i made the grand skidoo 

well you see pard it was this way-

   havent always been a lio

all this happened back in denver

  and twas twenty years ago



from a real old-timer

editor the railroad mans magazine

see by your light of the lantern de-
partment that good bad and indifferent
men are out for records good bad or indif-
ferent i think that i have a record myself
i have worked i am sixty years of age
and have worked on twenty-six different rail-
roads not counting four plantation roads
i began by braking on the northern central
out of baltimore in  i am now road-
master of the ferrocarril central domini-
can o i have had a varied experience

  during all this time and hard work i
have found time to marry and raise a fam-
ily can any one beat it i am one of
the real old-time railroad men of the west
and have seen more ups and downs than
usually fall to the lot of even a railroad
man still i find young men who have never
seen anything but a ballast switch who try
to tell me what a railroad mans work is

   sich is life

  i am a subscriber to the railroad mans
magazine since the first number and i
think that it is all to the good no blind
sidings about it

  while mr willets was writing about the
railroads of the southwest i could follow
him right along and i was a participant in
some of the shindigs that he described

  incidentally if any one else writes and
says that  billy the kid  was killed in san-
ta fe or that he flourished in  they are
in error  billy the kid  was killed by
pat garrett near fort sumner new mexico
in the year  i was there

 same time but less effort

the general manager of the coal trade
journal mr fred w saward has
sent us with his compliments several very
interesting matters of railway importance
for which he has our siticere thanks and
which we will be pleased to publish in

his letter to us he has the following to
say regarding the salt lake project of the
late e h harriman we believe it to be
of special interest to all our readers because
mr saward is a man who knows whereof
he writes

  the general idea of railroad improve-
ments is the quickening of time but it would
appear that the central pacific reconstruc-
tion across great salt lake had equally in
mind the doing of the same amount of work
as before in the same time but with less
effort for instance a comparison of old
and new time-tables will show that train
no  saves one hour and fifty-five minutes
by crossing great salt lake but it only
saves twelve minutes in the through run to
san francisco showing that it loses one
hour and forty-three minutes  the far end
of the line

  train no  saves an hour by crossing the
lake direct but loses one hour and three
minutes  the far end of the route so that
the net result is a loss of three minutes

  train no  has really been quickened to
some extent it gains two hours and fifteen
minutes by- crossing the lake and also gains
thirty-two minutes at the far end of the trip
so that the total saving is two hours and
forty-seven minutes i f i am not mistaken
however the connecting train leaves chi-
cago at the same time now as for many
years past  pm so that any saving west
of ogden is used up in the section east of
ogden

  in view of the discussion of harriman
methods from many standpoints it seems to
me that this phase of the matter may possess
some interest to the practical men among
your readers by making the requirements
of a certain task easier a financial saving is
secured and thus the company is compen-
sated for the heavy expenditure of such a
work as the great salt lake bridge and em-
bankment undertaking

our silent heroes

robert h rogerss article silent
heroes of the rail in our october
number created more than the usual amount
of notice we wish that we had the space
to publish all the letters relating to it that
have come to the carpet whenever an
article creates a controversy like unto the
much-mooted question when to jump
or the cook-peary north pole affair we
feel pretty good about it it would be a sad
old world if there werent two sides to every
question

editor the railroad mans magazine

  apropos of  silent heroes of the rail
i for one give very little credit to a hero
who would go out on a run when he knew
	the railroad mans magazine

his mother was a eorpse and that the fore-
man had held the letter so notifying him two
days

  what he should have done was to knock
the foremans block off for asking him to
go after delaying the letter as he did by
so doing he could have ascertained to a
minute just exactly how long it would have
taken them to get another fireman to fdl his
place and how much the noble company
appreciated him i think he was afraid of
losing his job

  as to the fireman who fired on the funeral
train he was a pin-head for standing in
front of the leaky throttle and his engineer
was a bigger one for asking him to do so
mr patrick collins was as dead as hed ever
be and had the packing all let go suddenly
and cooked his eyes out the company would
have put him in the scrap and if hed had
one eye left they would have given him a
crossing job at about twenty per

  i am favorable to giving credit where due
but  am satisfied that very few railroad men
approve of that type of heroism

a iioghead

editor the railroad mans magazine

as i have been a reader of your maga-
zine for something over a year i feel
safe in saying a word in its favor and an-
other reason is because i seldom see any
correspondence from the lone star state

  in the october number  i notice a
little talk by mr robert h rogers  silent
heroes of the rail

  well in my opinion which doesnt count
much- mr rogers is not very well ac-
quainted with hogheads as a fireman
brakeman and operator i believe i can tell
him a few strange tales

 he speaks of engineer e t parlett
who cut off a couple of fingers threw them
out of the cab-window and kept pounding
them also of mr daniel smith who with
a broken arm kept em  batting which re-
minds me of an engineer who came limping
into my office one night when  was doing
the owl in louisiana and wanted to know
where the engineer of a work-engine that
was tied up on the passing track slept

  i gavenhim necessary directions and he
limped out

  the tallow-pot whom i knew very well
came in and told me the story

  they were rolling along at about thirty
per on an extra north when mr engineer
spies a switch-light on the curve  big
holes  her and unloads right in a cattle
guard and lets the fireman take care of her
he had knocked the skin off himself in a
place or two also bunged his ankle up and
wanted to get the engineer on the work-
train to run his engine and let him rest in
the little red dog-house behind

  there are some brave ones and some aw-
ful big cowards among the engineers

  i guess this is enough knocking so will
speak a good word i think your magazine
the best on the- market and am always glad
to see it shown up on the news-stands may

it live long and continue to prosper lets
hear some more from spike malone

silsbee texas

found in a jumper

to h w claiborne south bend in-
diana we send sincere thanks- for an-
other old railroad epic  the night that
kearney died to which we gladly give
space mr claiborne found it in the pocket
of an old jumper of a relative who had
been an engineer on the texas and pacific
for fourteen years here goes

the night that kearney died

the wind was howling wildly
through the hand-rails on the side

and the fireman stoked in sileme
on the night that kearney died

the headlight shone through whirling flakes
on snow-banks deep and wide

and the whistles shriek was muffled
on  the night that kearney died

we could see the snow acoming
as we went through keys divide

but we couldnt see the broken rail
on the night that kearney died

kearney drove old number eight-

the heaviest and his pride-

but the broken rail it killed her
on the night that kearney died

kearney threw his sand and air-brakes

 but her weight still made us slide

so we uncoupled big old number eight-
on the night that kearney died

the coaches landed safely but
old eight lay on her side

shed filled the gap and saved a wreck-

on the night that kearney died

they told his blood-relations

and his newly married bride

how he left us like a hero-

on the night that kearney died

very english questions

we have just received a very welcome
letter from an english friend who
signs himself very english with it he
encloses a newspaper clipping showing the
splendid record of the english railroads in
the matter of accidents to passengers dur-
ing the year s this record of  pas-
sengers killed fires his patriotic zeal and
when patriotic zeal is fired the usual result
is an endeavor to make ashes of everybody
elses patriotic pride
on the editorial carpet



  we could not hope to give our readers
an idea of how very english this letter
is nor how hot and consuming is the
patriotic zeal without reproducing it word
for word so here it is he begins by call-
ing us gentlemen a concession which we
never claimed but for which we are duly
grateful then after granting so much for
the sake of argument he gets after us

  what is the ratio per thousand of rail-
road travelers in the states who get killed
or maimed by accident i enclose a clip-
ping on this subject about the english rail-
roads which speaks for itself when freight
has arrived at its destination do any of your
railroads deliver it to consignees at their
store or house in english we would say
 do the railroads  cart  their freight to the
consignee you can turn this into ameri-
can for yourself why do not your trains
whistle when leaving a station or depot in
england when a train is due to leave a sta-
tion the  guard  first looks at his watch
then compares it with the station clock
next he waves a flag by day or a lantern
by night to the driver then the driver
whistles to the guard who is busy slamming
the open doors of the carriages and finally
dives into his  van  as it passes in eng-
land the starting of a train is a serious
performance and should you be in the
vacinity  you could not help but know
that it has started why railroad mans
magazine should it be mans or
 mans  

                      yours etc

very english

  the date is -- why should you put
it --

  we fear that  very english is not seek-
ing information we fear that his notes
of interrogation as well as his notes of ex-
clamation really represent that sound which
caused peter to go out and weep bitterly
in short we fear he is crowing over us

  but who could be offended at such inno-
cent crowing in which boyish enthusiasm
struggles nobly with some facts nobly ig-
nores other facts and nobly mutilates
others upon the altar of patriotism not
we in sooth

  in the first place we have an unbounded
admiration for english railroads or rather
as our friend very fails to point put  rail-
ways an admiration which nearly twenty
years experience of them failed to extin-
guish their record is a thing we cannot
be led into disputing but very if you will
permit the affectionate abbreviation is there
not some difference between  miles of
railroad and  miles of railroad

  of course we have not the passenger con-
gestion to deal with that the english rail-
ways have but neither have they the
difficulty of laying perfect roadbeds with

perfect signal devices over thousands of
miles of practically unpopulated non-
revenue-producing country some of which
was not even explored until the railroad
surveyor pushed his way through its sealed
silences neither have the english rail-
ways the difficult problem of maintaining
discipline and obedience to rules through
an army of over  men scattered
over an area of over  square miles

   in english we would say do the rail-
roads cart their freight very this is
awful really you know you wouldnt say
any such thing you would say  do the
rail way  cart their goods  no very they
do not in the first place we have excellent
and cheap express service and in the sec-
ond place as our freight-rates are little
over half and in some cases one-third those
of our british brothers we feel that this
system of collection and delivery is a form
of extortion which our railroads have done
nobly to resist

  the chief reason that our trains do not
whistle when they leave a station is that
they ring a bell instead as very would
doubtless know if lie had ever been in an
american station long enough to take a
good look around it may not be as posi-
tive but anybody who has stood by an eng-
lish locomotive thinking dreamily of better
days to come and has been brought back
to the present by the announcement per
siren that the engine was about to start
will agree with s that the bell is easier on
the nerves frankly very we do not ad-
mire your whistles

  the elaborate method of keeping an eng-
lish train-crew awake long enough for the
train to get out of the station is excel-
lent we have often made special trips to
the station to watch it and we are fully
convinced not only that it is an effective
method but that it is tl only effective
method we have watched with palpita-
ting heart the guard make that dive into
the van and honestly it is the most won-
derful and thrilling thing we know

  the guard is always very stout he is
always extremely flat-footed and extremely
knock-kneed we do not mention these
facts in disparagement but merely to ac-
centuate the glcyy of his feat it is spec-
tacular truly if by nothing else  you
could not help but know that the train has
started

  why asks very  why railroad
mans magazine should it be mans or
mans   very wc fear you are hopeless
and we are sorry to say it because we like
you we had previously noticed in your
letter the curious indifference which all
englishmen seem to feel toward the eng-


the railroad mans magazine

lisli language but we fear that under a
question like this you should have signed
 very bad english

  let us explain  man is a singular
noun the plural of which is men not
 mans a noun not ending in  s in the
possessive case is indicated by an apos-
trophe and an  s  not by an  s and an
apostrophe

  as for why --  very we do
not know we are afraid that question is
not our gage so it will have to stand on the
blind siding along with the historic ques-
tion why eat ice-cream with a fork

our regrets to canada

unwittingly we ruffled the feelings
of  canadian  by allowing an appar-
ently slighting remark on canadian money
in mr koachs article on  fighting the
ticket scalpers  in the october number in
coupling canadian money with mexican and
confederate money we beg to assure  ca-
nadian  that no slight was intended

  we merely had in mind the inconvenience
of changing it into united states currency in
towns not on the border and the small fee
charged by the banks for making the ex-
change we would not for a moment cast
a slight on the financial responsibility of any
part of that wonderful empire whose chief
jewel is our northern neighbor and friend



the pay of engineers

editor the railroad mans magazine

  i am an interested reader of your maga-
zine and notice you are constantly being
questioned as to the rate of wages paid en-
gineers in this country

  in your answer to g d montreal
quebec that the highest pay you know of
any engineer receiving was  i wish
to state that when business is good freight
men in chain-gang service make  and
over a month

  we have a five-car passenger run that
leaves rincon new mexico at  am
arrives in silver city at  p-m and
leaves silver city at - pm arriving in
rincon at  pm the man on this run
is home everv night and draws  for a
thirty-day month if he works every trip

  there are three crews on the belen cut-
off between albuquerque and clovis new
mexico and each engineer draws  a
month and only works twenty days so they
have every third day at home

  at the rate of - and  per hun-
dred with divisions  miles long and very
little local work it does not take long to
make a good check

  thanking you for the many delightful

hours i have spent reading your magazine
and the information i have received from
it and trusting i may some time be of serv-
ice to you i remain

  much obliged c m p we would like
to give our readers the pleasure of reading

that a hundred and ninety-two pages week-

the prospect of making it would have for

we have just received a little call-down
which we admit is well merited we
allowed a reference to chief counsel dick-

a living from poultry

 from  hens in ten months
on a city lot  feet square

to the average poultry-
raan tlial would seem
impossible and when we
tell you that we have
actually done a st
poultry business with 
liens  a corner in the
city garden  feet wide
by  feet long we are
simply stating facts it
would not be possible to
get such returns by any
one of the systems of
poultry keeping recom-
mended and practiced by
the american people
still it is an easy matter
when the new

 philo
 system

              is adopted

the philo system is unlike all other
ways of keeping poultry

and in many respects just the reverse accomplishing things in poul-
try work that have always been considered impossible and getting
unheard-of results that are hard to believe without seeing

the new system covers all branches
of the work necessary for success

from selecting the breeders to marketing the product it jells how
to get eggs that will hatch how to hatch nearly every egg and how
to raise nearly all the chicks hatched it gives complete plans in
detail how to make everything necessary to run the business and at
less than half the cost required to handle the poultry business in any
other manner 

two pound broilers in eight weeks

are raised in a space f less than a square foot to the broiler without
any loss and the broilers are f the very best quality bringing here
three cents per pound above the highest market price

our six-months-old pullets are laying
at the rate of  eggs each per month

in a space of two square feet for each bird no green cut bone of
any description is ted and the food used is inexpensive as compared
with food others are using

  our new book the philo system of poultry keeping gives
full particulars regarding these wonderful discoveries with simple
easy-to-understand directions iha are right to the point and pages
of illustrations showing all branches of the work from start to finish

dont let the chicks die in the shell

  one of our secrets of success is to save all the chickens that arc
fully developed at hatching time whether they can crack the shell
or not it is a simple trick and believed to be the secret of the
ancient egyptians and chinese which enabled them to sell the
chicks at  cents a dozen

chicken feed at  cents a bushel

our book tells how to make the best green food with but little
trouble and have a good supply any day in the year winter or sum-
mer it is just as impossible to pet a large egg yield without green
food as it is to keep a cow without hay or fodder

our new brooder saves  cents on
each chicken

no lamp required no danger of chilling overheating or burn-
ing up the chickens as with brooders using lamps or any kind of
fire they also keep all the lice off the chickens automatically or
kill any that may be on them when placed in the brooder our
book gives full plans and the right to make and use them one
can easily be made in an hour at a cost of  to  cents

put them in one of your tireless brooders and we had zero weather
we succeeded in bringing through nine  one got killed by accident

  dear sir-l have followed your system
as close as i could the result is a complete
success if there can be any improvement
on nature your brooder is it the first ex-
perience  had with your system was last
december  hatched  chicks under
two hens put them as soon as hatched in
one of your brooders out of doors and at
the age of three months i sold them at c
a pound they then averaged  - lbs
each and the man i sold them to said they
were the finest he ever saw and he wants
