the green book
album

for the first time in liis twenty-two
years of existence henry disney
was really perplexed and as he sat
at the rickety table in his dollar-and-a-
half-a-week room he scratched his
head and gave vent to smothered
ejaculations as he glanced over papers

copyright  by the story-press corporation

 and photographs which had reposed in
 his old bag for years

 disney was what might be termed a
 might- good-natured chap in spite of
 the fact that the world had not show-
 ered its financial blessings on him here-
 tofore he was but a milk-wagon drkr-

 etitered at stationers hau london ah rights reserved

 


the green book album

er-one of that ilk whose misfortune
it is to have to arise with the sun dur-
ing the summer and several hours be-
fore old sol when the weather is most

cheerless he was a large fat freckled-
faced youth with a smile which
wouldnt come off and a determina-
tion to look on the better side of things
if that side was ever turned his way
but here he was confronted with a
proposition to which he could find no
solution a knock came on the door
buck reade entered attired in a
garb which raised disneys eyebrows

  under ordinary circumstances reade
was rather a fine-looking young chap
slight pale with slim feet and hands
but with a manner of self-conscious-
ness his speech was ever studied as
he was continually endeavoring to be
correct in both construction and pro-
nunciation bucks misfortune in life
was that he was born to the menial
sphere and at present held a position
in shops where his daily attire consisted
of overalls and jumper with the nec-
essary adjuncts underneath what
was disneys surprise then to see him
clothed in evening dress of rather un-
fashionable type-although disney was
all unconscious of this-with a large
white tie clumsily arranged about his
throat and shod in new and squeaky
patent-leather shoes

  jumping jehosaphat ejaculated
disney leaping to his feet and taking
reade by the lapel of his coat been
a fire-sale somewhere reade wore a
dignity which did not exactly become
him as he replied much to the amuse-
ment of his friend

  in good society henry it is not
considered proper to comment on a
friends clothing

  aw gwan you know you just beat
it in here sos i could get a peek at
you then with another survey of the
exhibition all you need is a gold-
tpped cigaret and you  be a ringer
for the villain in wedded but no
wife 

  reade drew himself up slightly
glancing in a resigned manner at dis-
ney as he returned in good society
henry these suits are always donned
after six p m

  honest every night reade nod-
ded how do they keep em clean
and he pointed to reades shirt front
and tie

 tn good society-reade started
again when disney broke in

  dont make a song of it buck and
the latter concluded

  they change them every night
disney glanced at his friend skeptical-
ly and he turned slightly away

  huh i guess they dont have to pay
the laundry any eight cents a-piece for
shirts like i do they must get a re-
duction for quantity honest buck
have you got a job as waiter cause

i	cant see any other reason for your
havin that front

  reade was inclined to feel offended
but disney soothed him so he confided
the fact that he was going to be a
gentleman for one night if he died for
it then he hesitated a moment as
though afraid that disney would laugh
at him and continued

  miss lanvales having a theatre-
party at the opera house to-morrow
night you remember me telling you
about her the lady i showed through
the shops shes only seen me in over-
alls  she wont recognize me in these
and ive a seat in the orchestra right
near her box

 disney expressed dismay at the
thought of two bucks being thrown
away in this manner but finally real-
ized that when a man is in love what-
ever his station in life money cuts a
small figure if he can be close to the
object of his affection reade then con-
fided that he was even going to the
anglemere after the performance to
get something to eat that he might
still be near her while she was dining
this proved the last straw for disney
and he turned away disgustedly

  aw say buck dont be a goat
whats the use o bein daffy over a
swell dame like that youre tony in
your notions but you aint there with
the long green and by the time you
are men your agell be callin her
mommer forget it

  reade immediately became despond-
ent at this lack of sympathy with his
love affairs while disney turned again
snobs



to the survey of his papers and photo-
graphs looking up to add its up to
you to stop her runaway autahmobeel
thats the way them magazine fel-
lers gets over-weight then seeing
reades despair there there buck
dont mind me the suit looks nifty
all riglit

  reade started for his room to dis-
card the clothes when disney suggest-
ed they go over to mikes for a game
of pool later in the evening following
the expected visit of a lawyer this
caused reade to make a wondering in-
quiry and disney thrust out a letter for
his perusal he glanced over it down
to the signature when he exclaimed

  why this is signed phipps mayna-
dier

  lawyers monicker evidently re-
turned disney reade opened his eyes
in glad surprise

  why lies the secretary of the
bachelors cotillion club-the most ex-
clusive social organization in town

  well i aint tryin to horn myself
in there but you see what he says
and he took the letter back pointing out
a portion of it for me to get out my
mothers marriage certificate and my
birth certificate and photographs of
my father and mother he handed
the photographs to reade i never saw
pop that i can remember he was a
britisher ma said he used to hit the
booze sumpin fierce good-lookin guy
wasnt he reade was gasping in as-
tonishment as he looked on the fea-
tures in the photograph

  why henry he was-a gentle-
man 

  sure he was returned his friend
just cause he gurgled the grape aint
no reason for thinkin he wasnt
reade turned to him a bit impatiently

  oh i dont mean what you mean
and he pointed to the uniform dis-
played in the photograph your father
was an english army officer and a
glance of admiration overspread his
countenance as he looked at disney
the latter took another look at the pic-
ture and then up at reade

  ill say this for you buck youve
picked up a lot readin those books o
yours comes in mighty handy some-

times then he puffed up a bit so
pop was a swell was he  and he
walked away with an amusing stride

  i wish to god mine had been so-
liloquized reade disconsolately i
wouldnt be a furnace-tender in the
mount clare shops disney turned
quickly to his chum

  thats got it all over drivin a
milk-wagon-like me what was your
father buck he went over to the
younger man placing his hand consol-
ingly on his shoulder reade looked
straight ahead as though trying to
pierce through the gloom which he saw
in his future

  he used to play the piano in saloons
-and other places played by ear-
could hardly read his own name dis-
ney patted him on the shoulder again
as he turned away slightly

  looks like we ought to swap fa-
thers buck and stopped as a knock
came at the door guess thats the law-
yer come in

  the door opened disclosing a youth-
ful slender blonde and very well-
dressed girl she wore a black-and-
white tailored suit with a small velvet
toque trimmed with aigrettes black
lynx furs and carried a variety of gold
jingles on a chain as disney saw her
he dived for his coat and reade was
noticeably ill at ease the young lady
gave a look of surprise at reades get-
up but smiled as she turned to him -

  im sure i beg your pardon are you
mr disney reade was stupefied but
disney came forward with an air of
gallantry

  thats me miss can i do anything
for you  and he glanced at her polite-
ly but admiringly

  ive been visiting my old nurse up-
stairs and stayed longer than i expected
to its dark and raining now so i shall
want a cab to get home will you fetch
me one disney laughed good-natured-
ly at the thought of such a thing ex-
plaining that she couldnt get a cab in
this district with a search-warrant

  they dont have any use for them
things down this way cept for wed-
dins and funerals reade suggested
the cab-stand at a distant corner and
disney asked if she would await his re-


the green book album

turn until he could phone to this place
it would only take about ten minutes to

have the cab there reade questioned
the propriety of her waiting there alone
with him but disney chipped in with
a lot she cares what people down this

way think	

oh youre wrong mr disney
when he broke in on her almost roughly

  dont throw a bluff little lady i
drive a milk-wagon and my friend
here is a furnace-tender we can say
all we want to about bein as good as
you are but the louder we say it the
more we knosv it aint so and he
stalked out on his errand

ii

  there was a moments embarrassing
pause and then the feminine instinct
asserted itself as she turned to reade
asking him what his position meant to
which he replied rather shortly that the
name explained itself her expression
exhibited her doubt of his being a fur-
nace-tender and she asked to see his
hands after an examination of which
she expressed her disbelief openly but
he explained that soap and pumice-
stone had virtues of their own on her
questioning his attire he explained

  theyre the first i ever had she
had unconsciously touched his vanity in
a soothing manner and had reached his
heart i bought them ready made are
they all right she looked him over
critically

  all except the tie shall i show
you and as he moved towards her
she untied the mess and then as she
lied it neatly explained carefully to him
how she did it that he might do like-
wise in future adding that she always
tied her fathers for him poor old
dad didnt wear dress ties until he was
nearly forty reades wide-open eyes
at this announcement caused her to
add you see he began life as an oys-
ter-shucker and they dont really need
to know anything about dress clothes
lies peter parkyn ever hear of him
reades eyes were opening wider all
the time

  the parkyn pickling co reades

tone was that of open admiration and
miss parkyn smiled knowingly

  thats what they always say when
mamma tries to get me an invitation
to the bachelors cotillions only they
turn up their noses and you say it with
respect the young man expressed
surprise that there should be any ques-
tion as to her eligibility to such events
you see she continued they cant
forget that dad was an oyster-shueker
thats why rich american girls gener-
ally marry foreigners theyve been
gentlemen so long that they know noth-
ing matters but money over here
where its a question of only two or
three generations theyre finicky
reade groaned in despair at this he
was getting his first real lesson in the
requirements of a society man

  you mean to say that when a man
has made money he cant get into so-
ciety even then her smile was some-
what cynical

  well you see papas only made two
or three millions if it wrere twenty or
thirty we might get into new york so-
ciety by way of london paris and
monte carlo but in a town like this-
well its big but awfully little in these
things the conversation drifted on in
this channel until finally reade was
struck with an inspiration and asked if
she knew a miss lanvale and if so if
she was like the society people miss
parkyn had pictured

  she spells society with a double
s and a hiss like a snake reade
was on the defensive in a second

  i showed her through the shops
once and she was very nice to me
miss parkyn approached him with the
air of a philosopher prepared to give
him the first drop of real advice which
should act as wormwood but so pre-
pare him for the inevitable should he
ever have the opportunity to approach
the sacred portals of the society world
-of which she had grave doubts

  its always easy to be nice to a man
in a ditch when youre sitting on a
wall but when that same man gets a
ladder and wants a seat alongside you
theres going to be some coldness

  again reade sought to defend the
social position of the woman he ad-
snobs



mired but miss parkyn had an argu-
ment for his every statement and they
were in the heat of the discussion when
disney returned and apologized very
much out of breath to announce that
no livery stable would send a cab to the
house as it savored too much of the
practical joke however at that mo-
ment a cab was heard to stop before the
house and the two men rushed to the
window where they saw a man step-
ping to the sidewalk

  phipps maynadier ill bet said
reade turning to disney for confirma-
tion-on which announcement miss
parkyn swung about to them with an
air of reproach asking what it meant
and if they had been putting up a game
on her before they could answer or
cplain there was a knock and disney
admitted mr maynadier who gave a
pronounced start as he saw the young
lady in the presence of these working
men

  he was not a bad-looking man this
phipps maynadier-somewhat lean but
exceedingly well-groomed wearing
clothes of the latest cut and carrying a
gold-headed cane he was inclined to be
dandified and having an air of super-
ciliousness which spoiled the otherwise
good impression one might have had
of him on first acquaintance he bit his
small moustache in nervousness and
then apologized for his seeming intru-
sion

  couldnt have come at a better
time said disney enthusiastically
the breaks just right he then ex-
plained miss parkyns presence and the
dire need of a cab in which to send her
home requesting the loan of mayna-
diers who expressed a slightly indif-
ferent delight at the idea miss parkyn
wore a slight smile during the prelimi-
nary explanations but now walked over
to maynadier eyeing him coolly

  i hate to be a bother but its rain-
ing and the street cars are five blocks
off maynadier returned her glance
with a somewhat puzzled expression

  ive seen you somewhere surely
havent i she bowed with a little
smile

  yes-i live next door to you he
started to apologize on which disney

turned away to conceal his amusement
at miss parkyns remark and she went
on  yes mr maynadier but we dont
suffer from the same handicap that you
do youve got a damned canner liv-
ing next door to you-we havent

  the slight inflection she gave the
quoted remark seemed to chill the air
and the man hastened to offer another
confused apology but she went on
wearily brushing his remark aside
oh dont tell me you didnt say it be
bold in your snobbishness mr mayna-
dier tell me that youll do all you can
to keep the newly-rich out of the bach-
elors cotillions explain that youve
your own kind of people to consider
be a snob if you will-but be a brave
one

  disneys admiration for the little
woman rose a thousand per cent at this
display of nerve on her part but he
maintained silence for a moment may-
nadier made a brave display of apolo-
gy for having called her father a qual-
ified canner and offered his cab

  oh ive no false pride she re-
turned i dont want to get muddy
ill take your cab but i wont forgive
you because youre not brave good-
night mr disney-and mr reade
and thank ou both she started
for the door disney hat in hand start-
ed after her no no dont come
down good-night and she was gone

ill

  disney looked after her admiringly
sighed deeply and then turned to the
others

  aint she a peachamaroot then he
turned to maynadier did you catch
onto her eyes chief but what were
you and her scrappin about mayna-
dier was obviously uncomfortable

  really mr disney-

  dont mister me said that gentle-
man im not used to it reminds me
of the installment collector on a chip-
diamond i bought a girl once whats
the argument at this reade broke in
bitterly

  her father started life as an oyster-
shucker so shes not good enough for


the green book album

the secretary of the bachelors cotil-
lion to know disney was astounded
and his fighting blood was aroused at
the thought of this little woman not
being good enough for anyone

  come on now chief cjci it on
your chest what did you come down
here for if that little girl lives next
door to you and she a nit good enough
for you what did you blow down this
way for im common i am dead com-
mon and i dont care who knows it
see maynadier seeing he had got
himself in wrong to start endeavored
to smooth matters by announcing that
disney was far from being common at
the same time asking for the papers
and photographs about which he had
written disney swept the lot over to
maynadier with a gesture of disgust
theres the junk whats doing the
lawyer examined everything very care-
fully and holding them in one hand
extended the other to disney

  your grace i congratulate you
disney withheld his hand looking at
maynadier as though the latter had
taken leave of his senses and eyeing
the papers closely

  who gave you leave to take my pa-
pers come through with them come
on but maynadier only held them the
closer bowing to disney

  i shall have to take them with me
they are necessary to prove your iden-
tity as the right honorable henry
lancaster morpeth orth knight com-
mander of the bath baron glenroy
knight of the garter earl of flint and
duke of walshire disney listened to
tins rigmarole with an expression of
disgust and disbelief and then shouted

  say chief  you dont know me well
enough to pull any of that kind of
stuff maynadier replaced the pictures
and papers on the table at the
same time taking a photograph from
his pocket and pointed to it ex-
plaining that the original was the
third son of the duke of walshire
that he had been lost track of since
he left england after having got
into trouble that his eldest brother had
broken his neck while fox-hunting his
second brother was killed in afghanis-
tan and the two sons of the eldest

brother had been drowned while yacht-
ing taking up disneys photograph of
his father he showed that the two were
of the same party reade had become
intensely interested during this and
was now glancing over maynadiers
shoulder

  henry hes not kidding its so
its so he said excitedly disney
looked from one to the other not know-
ing what to do or say and hardly be-
lieving his own ears maynadier then
settled all doubts in his mind by in-
forming him that the new york law-
yers of whom he was the representa-
tive had learned that his father had
assumed the name of disney arid had
married celia boggers and that after
their death he henry disney had
come here to live with his uncle of
whom he had learned this address con-
cluding the explanation with the re-
mark 

  you go to england as the greatest
man in the united kingdom-next to
the royal family-the duke of wal-
shire disney opened his capacious
mouth widely at this gave a choking
gasp and sat heavily in a conveniently
adjacent chair

  good - gawd  - me - a - a -
dook

  he thought for a second and then
turned fiercely on maynadier thisd
better be on the level or somebodyll
get killed maynadier only smiled at
this threat and bowed again to his
lordship

  you have five residences flint
house cadogan square beaulieu ab-
bey berks castle gwvnnwydd on the
marches richmond castle- but dis-
ney checked him in furious resentment
rising to his feet and glancing about
his poor quarters feeling that all this
was some cruel practical joke which
the innocent maynadier was playing on
him he couldnt realize that such for-
tune could be his nor that maynadier
never even having heard of him be-
fore could have anv possible motive for
playing a trick of this kind he was
only fighting mad through and through
and looked much as though he would
heave the lawyer through the door
closed as it was

iv

  its funny aint it said disney
catching the smile on the face of the
sycophantic lawyer who was seated by
this time disney towered over him in
his wrath you sit there and tell me
how great im goin to be an all the
time youre sayin to yourself if it was
only me whats gettin what this cheap
skates gettinis yes an you know
youre bettern me all the time youre
pretendin respect and he tore on in
his rage informing maynadier how he
had come to be a milk-wagon driver
starting in to earn his living when only
twelve years old pointing to his big
coarse hands as evidence of the fact
that he was nothing but a workman
he didnt thank anyone for dying
and making him a dook deliberately
accusing maynadier of acting as though
he thought disney was trying to butt
in where he didnt belong

 but your grace- maynadier
started disney choked him off

  nix on that call me disney and
he turned disgustedly away reade
tried to mend matters somewhat and
hesitatingly suggested

  but if youre a duke henry you
cant go on driving a milk-wagon dis-
ney turned on reade as though he had
expected him to stand up for his rights
as an american citizen and was disap-
pointed on seeing him go over to the
enemy

  listen buck i aint got any affec-
tion for that milk-wagon it aint goin
to give me any pain not to get up at five
g in but if you think im gunna eng-
land an make a holy show outa myself
before all them dooks an people you
got another think cornin then he
turned to maynadier with a remark and
look which was meant to settle the mat-
ter once and for all you cant make
no dook outa me just by tellin me i
am one and to maynadiers query as
to what disney suggested as a way out
of the situation he continued youre
gunna teach me what im gunna do
teach me see  i dont talk right i
dont dress right an i dont eat right-
i dont do a lot o things right that a
dook oughta do so im gunna have you

take me into society in this town when
i get a sort o crust on ill hit the pike
for england

  maynadier expressed delight at this
proposition and then disney learning
that the former was none too well off
in respect to worldly goods and realiz-
ing that he would have to pay some one
handsomely to go through with this
idea made a good financial proposition
to maynadier only making it a condi-
tion that it should not become known
that he was a dook

  to this however maynadier was not
inclined to agree as being a lawyer
with small practice and lawyers hav-
ing little chance to get any legitimate
advertising he had figured on the no-
toriety it would bring him if it were
announced that he phipps maynadier
had located the missing duke of wal-
sh ire and especially had found him
working in the humble capacity of
milk-wagon driver he showed disney
a copy of one of the dailies to prove
that the publicity had already been
started the dook gave a sigh of re-
lief after glancing it over when he
saw that his name was not mentioned
maynadier was then for taking dis-
ney to new york where he would have
a better opportunity to remain incog-
nito but the latter wouldnt hear of it

   member that girl that was here just
now he asked in the most serious
manner miss parkyn maynadier
nodded and wondered what she might
have to do with the situation well
she made a hit with me im for her
strong when she walked out i didnt
ever expect to see her again cause i
was a milk-wagon driver and she was
a real swell lady but theres been a
fresh deal since then and she can play
in my ancestral castles if she takes a
notion see maynadier smiled in his
supercilious manner and his nose ele-
vated just a trifle as he remarked

 you wont have to ask her but
once disney was inclined to become
angry at the interference of mayna-
dier and questioned the possibility of
miss parkyns liking him or even
thinking of him a second time after
having seen him but once but mayna-
dier called his attention to the fact that


the green book album

any hr would jump at the chance of
being duchess of walshre dsney
with the thought in mind that all pub-
licity in so far as his name was con-
cerned was to be checked remarked
that she would never know when may-
nadier stuck the newspaper before him

  after that and disney was dis-
gusted again

  aaaw-hell then turning to
reade as a sudden thought struck him
lie informed that young man that he
was to accompany him to england
which reade seemed very pleased to
agree upon all right now this news-
paper didnt give any name for the
dook if maynadier introduces us at
the same time theyll likely think youre
it why its great turning to may-
nadier with the first broad smile he had
worn for half ail hour he asked
would ou take me for a dook when
lies around maynadier was disap-
pointed at this suggestion on the part
of disney and became almost angry as
he asked disney if he was insane the
latter laughed heartily

  no im a wisenheimer from wise-
ville-on-the-weiser maynadier and
he pointed to reades hands and gen-
eral appearance look at his lily-white
hands observ e his intellectyoo-al brow
does he step all over himself when he
talks he dont does he crooly mas-
sacre the english grammar he dont
all his life hes bin trainin to be a
dook an now his times come buck
youre unanimously elected to all those
barons and knights and earls and things
that maynadier says i am and he
bowed low before reade who gazed at
him with a puzzled expression which
had both a question as to disneys san-
ity in it and a refusal of the position
thus thrust on him disney saw it not
however and turned to maynadier as
he bowed again

  why dont you salaam aint you
got any respect for that great man the
dook of walshire

v

  maynadier had his hands full for the
next few hours endeavoring to smooth

matters for the entrance of the newly-
discovered duke to the heretofore for-
bidden realms of society but by the
following afternoon disney had attired
himself in what to him was gorgeous
raiment and was ready for any fray
which might occur reade having ac-
quainted himself through his novels
with the dress demands of society pre-
sented a less striking appearance than
his friend

  mrs pendleton beauregard was gen-
erally considered the personification of
the acme of perfection in manners in
the exclusive set and thus we find her
one of the most important members of
the country club and a person from
whose decision on points of etiquette
etc there was little or no chance of
appeal for many years her years now
numbered about half a century she
had striven to reach the point from
which she now looked down upon the
younger fry and she was of that breed
of femininity which never releases its
social status without a good stiff argu-
ment

  her pet among the younger set was
her niece laura lanvale the young
lady of whom reade presumed to
dream of course the debutante was ut-
terly unaware of this grande passion
mrs pendleton beauregard and her
lovely charge were seated on the after-
noon following the discovery of the
duke of walshire before the fireplace
in the general reception hall of the
country club engaged in the small talk
of such people a man passed through
the room carrying his bag of golf-sticks
and the elder lady turned to see who it
was raising her usually high-pointed
nose a trifle more than ordinary as he
turned back to her niece

  there goes that bickens person
surely he isnt a member of the club

  my dear aunt phcebe- said the
younger one with a resigned expres-
sion anybody can belong to a country
club and everybody who can afford
the price mrs beauregard sighed in
despair as the thought of other and
earlier years of her club life recurred
to her

  but why it didnt use to be like
that formerly one only saw the people
snobs



one knew laura turned slightly to her
aunt and remarked rather satirically
yes and thats about all one did
see one didnt see any cricket-house
or bowling-alleys or swimming-pool
and the dining-room was a disgrace
weve two thousand members now
mrs beauregard was inclined to be
scornful at this vulgarly bragging re-
mark

  yes and what kind of members

  all kinds but one doesnt have to
know them all

  the argument was ended by the en-
trance of miss parkyn which called
for a scarcely subdued sniff from the
matron miss parkyn was very attract-
ively gowned in a golfing outfit with a
white stock collar fastened with a gold
horn her skirt was quite short and
neatly pleated and the white tam-o-
shanter which she removed shortly
after she entered seemed a fitting finish
for her girlish attractiveness she gave
the two women a glance of recognition
as she went directly to the mirror to
arrange her tossed tresses she was a
care-free little woman sufficiently in-
dependent so that the apparent cool-
ness of the others affected her not at
all in fact it rather amused her

  hulloa laura she chirped seen
phipps maynadier to-day

  i have not seen mr maynadier
said laura and the very slight inflec-
tion she placed on the mr caused a
smile on the lips of the questioner but
she passed it by as not worthy of note
she invited the others to tea with her
but they declined so she ordered some
for herself to be served there and then
proceeded to inform laura regarding
her trip of the previous night of having
met maynadier there and that she had
learned on her return home that he
dug up a duke

  do you know ive an idea that i
met him here was occasion for laura
to unbend which she did to the obvious
enjoyment of the other who read her
like a book and her amusement was
even greater to see mrs beauregard
relax a bit of her habitual stiffness and
frigidity at the mention of royalty to
miss lanvales query as to what his
lordship looked like she continued

  well on one hand he was slender
romantic and very much in love with
you

  she spoke off-handedly as though
the process of falling in with royalty
were an every-day occurrence with
her but laura at the mention of the
young man being in love with her was
more than ever interested and mrs
beauregard gave her chair an extra
hitch the better to hear the conversa-
tion miss parkyn lost not one jot of all
this and having started things well was
prepared to go on

  in love with me what are you talk-
ing about nondas the boy entered
with the sandwiches and tea setting
the tray before miss parkyn and the
lanvales aunt and niece maintained
their patience until he had left nondas
started with her little lunch very calm-
ly allowing the others to start the ball
rolling again and then she talked very
indifferently about her experience afl
the while enjoying lauras nervous
anxiety as to how the duke could know
anything of her with a mouth-full of
sandwich she looked up and went on

  he showed you through the mount
clare shops once he told me laura
clasped her hands ecstatically as the
romance of the situation dawned upon
her and turned to her aunt

  i remember he was very good-
looking and had beautiful manners
and then she turned back to nondas as
though to coax more information and
that was the duke of walshire-only
fancy and again her mind flew off to
castles in the air already she was plan-
ning how she could meet the duke
whether now that he was a duke he
would still care for her and what she
should do when she was in reality a
duchess these dreams are so beautiful
-for women of american society miss
parkyn ate on with a perfectly bland
expression but an unobserved twinkle
in her eye she seemed to be chewing
the cud of reflection as though she had
something to put over on miss lan-
vale and was figuring on how best to
accomplish this she looked up with a
far-away expression which was some-
what akin to lauras previous one as
she added


the green book album

  on the other hand he was freckled
broad-shouldered and drove a milk-

wagon there was no smile on her face
now for she was back in the room
again and looking at the big good-
natured fellow who had run the errand
for her it mattered little to her whether
be was a duke if circumstances could
only be brought about-

  what are you doing nondas
lauras tone of annoyance brought her
back to her repast in one bound de-
scribing two entirely different persons
as the duke of walsh ire

  well there were two of them and
again the mischievous look came one
was named reade the other disney
disney had freckles-and a sense of
humor reade had been educating him-
self on ten-cent novels bound in dollar-
and-a-half covers current literature in
fact free library stuff laura listened
and then hesitated as she figured how
to ask the question uppermost in her
mind but nondas anticipated her in
love with you why reade was hes
been reading king cophetua and the
beggar maid and hes got you cast for
the metamorphosed male lead laura
tried to be dignified as she withdrew
a step and asked with an air of almost
incredulity

  how could he be in love with me
nondas stopped in the act of biting a
sandwich glancing at laura critically
from head to foot

  im blessed if i know no sense of
humor probably lauras anger was
aroused by this but nondas diplomat-
ically smoothed the ruffled waters and
laura again asked if she really thought
reade was the duke

  well hes nearer the popular con-
ception of a nobleman than the man
who drove the milk-wagon oh i
forgot to ask you laura and she
turned from her cup of tea again is
a duke eligible to marry into the lan-
vale family she noted lauras look
of surprise and query but went on
very innocently you see if it should
turn out that mr reade were the duke
i was just wondering if his family
would be good enough to permit you
to be his wife laura was inclined
to be sarcastic as she endeavored to

give nondas a lesson in the rights of

royalty

  the duke of walshire is the great-
est nobleman in england nondas he
can keep his hat on in the kings

presence

  does the family have a chronic cold
or do they get bald early nondas
expression was an absolutely bland one
and this annoyed laura

  nondas is nothing sacred to you

  money is speaking of that the
duke of walshire has fourteen million
pounds sterling i thought from that
that his grandfather might be a retired
brewer laura became frigidly up-
right in her carriage

  its one of the oldest titles in eng-
land

  oh then the money must have come
in a perfectly gentlemanly manner-like
marrying some woman who had it 
she turned to see a boy entering with
the afternoon papers and taking one
from him opened it to learn the latest
news of the duke this will tell us
which is the duke-reade or disney
she looked it over very carefully
laura standing by her side and even
mrs beauregard after a seconds hesi-
tation went over to the young ladies
and laura introduced her to nondas
after her query as to whether she
knew the young lady mrs beaure-
gard inclined her head at the introduc-
tion as though in great pain thus
acknowledging nondas necessary but
undesirablepresence nondas acknowl-
edgment was almost equally cool and
then she turned slightly writh a smile
as she remarked quietly

  i always like to know whos looking
over my shoulder the elder lady
accepted the thrust by turning with an
air of great dignity and going to her
chair where she sat again nondas
watched her and then reopened the
paper looking it over until she gave a
little cry of pleasure as she found the
article she wished a second later she
was disappointed wrere done laura
the mystery of the missing duke is
not explained in this instalment but
laura didnt grasp it thimble thim-
ble whos got the thimble phipps
maynadier refuses to give any informa-
snobs



tion he says the duke is found that
he is in an humble situation and that
he knew nothing of his good fortune
and she again looked at the article
reading aloud  the duke does not
desire his identity to become known at
the present time for reasons he does
not care to explain she handed
laura the paper and looked at her
nows the time said she glancing
quickly at laura to use your knowl-
edge of blood and breeding surely a
lanvale ought to be able to smell out
a duke and with this parthian shot
she left to change from her golf-
clothes

  mrs beauregard looked after her
and then snorted an odious thing
ill-bred and utterly common laura
was down-cast for a moment and then
the idea of the duke took hold of her
again and she switched around to her
aunt

  do you suppose she was telling the
truth about the duke

  why should she snapped that lady
other men have been in love with you
phipps maynadier for instance laura
gave her head a slight toss at the men-
tion of the lawyers name

  yes but a duke how romantic it
would be think of meeting him as a
laborer and i hardly noticed him ex-
cept that he was a very respectable
person then she aviated again to her
air-castles until her aunt brought her
back to earth by asking what she was
day-dreaming about think of being
the wife of the premier peer-the first
lady of england why i should walk
into court directly after the royal fam-
ily the first lady of england and hes
a multi-millionaire besides

  then followed an argument between
the two as to the social standing of the
lanvale family of which both of them
were members there seemed to be
some question in the mind of her aunt
as to whether laura would really be
eligible as the wife of the duke of wal-
shire for was he not as far above her
as she had been alxve him when he
was a furnace-tender then also arose
the question as to whether or not there
were not some definite understanding
between laura and maynadier at

which miss laura was virtuously in-
dignant how dare anyone question her
about maynadier when she had the
opportunity to land a duke 

  its likely id bother about phipps
if i could have the duke of walshire

  you havent snared your ducal bird
out of the bush yet returned her aunt
with a sweetness of tone which fore-
boded further trouble if the young lady
persisted against her wishes and you
have got phipps in the palm of your
hand

  well if i marry him it means the
same kind of poverty ive had all my
life and poverty on ten thousand a year
is the worst kind of poverty there is
you know that aunt phoebe-and the
elder woman signified her knowledge of
the fact by an expressive nod of her
head besides the moment i go to new
york london and paris-any big city
-im a nonentity i want to be some-
body in the big world not in this small
one her aunt gave her a sympathiz-
ing glance as of one who had passed
through the mill years ago and knew
whereof she was speaking

  my dear its pretty nice to be some-
body anywhere but i sympathize with
you and she reached out her hands
to her niece were all nonentities liv-
ing on our families past greatness
thats why were such great ancestor
worshipers she started for the door
and laura dragged herself after her
aunt and peered through the lattice

  here comes bradley fairfax her
aunt also looked in that direction and
almost sank back on the floor as she
gasped

  and whos that he has with him

  he must be quite all right or brad-
ley wouldnt be seen with him bradley
is if anything just a trifle too correct
and they returned to their chairs to
await fairfaxs arrival turning their
high-backed chairs so that the new-
comers could not see them as they en-
tered

vi

  get one flash of disney as he him-
self would say as he came into the re-
ception room with the more than highly


tie green book album

respectable bradley fairfax he was a
sight for the gods and the environ-
ments of the country club used as
they were to strange sights must have
trembled on their foundations when
he appeared why is it that large men
even those whose knowledge of dress
should be correct will invariably array
themselves in something loud  do they
think their bulk wont attract sufficient
attention  possibly however that may
be disney could have been both seen
and heard half a mile before he entered
the portals of the exclusive precincts

  black and white check suit pink
necktie gray spats which were almost
of a blue turn of mind flannel waist-
coat surmounted with broad black and
white stripes all of them cost good
money for he had been lavish but all
of which fitted him semi-occasionally
having been ready-made and disneys
manly bulk was not of a sort to permit
the ready-made type of clothes to hang
just right he had large dogs-head
cuff-buttons on his sleeve extremities
and carried a stick with the same em-
blem on the head of it these were all of
solid gold with ruby eyes for the ca-
nines and the stick created a louder
report than the wearer himself he was
a picture

  in sharp contrast was bradley fair-
fax faultlessly dressed in the fashion
of the day very quiet and unassuming
in all respects they were as day and
night set side by side and had the fem-
inine portion of the lanvale family had
any sense of humor whatever they
would have enjoyed a hearty laugh
when first their eyes fell upon he pair
fairfax was obviously uncomfortable
in the presence of disney and was not
slow to make known his feelings

  i say you know he remarked as
he turned to that person on entering
the room i dont like to say it but
this is a club you know a cfub and
only members are allowed in it dis-
ney beamed on him his supreme wealth
of smile

  well aint you a member fairfax
had to acknowledge that he was well
cant you take me into your club fair-
fax twisted nervously for the space of
a second and then had a brilliant idea

  only with a party of six and be-
sides as an afterthought which he
believed would clinch the situation i
dont know you

  you knew me well enough to take
a ride in my autahmobeel didnt you
the dispositions of the two men were
becoming more and more apparent
every moment the chill society man-
ner of the one and the genial open-
heartedness of the others democracy
fairfax grasped unavailingly at a
straw

  well you asked me

  certainly i asked you and disney
patted the other on the shoulder i
try to act the gentleman even if i aint
one an when i see you with your
autahmobeel all on the fritz i says
leave your man to take care of it and
send a hurry-call for the repair shop
didnt i but im looking for miss
parkyn he continued as he grasped
the other by the coat lapel fairfax
trying to evade him and go to the
phone miss nondas parkyn they
said at her house that she was out
here fairfax stiffened perceptibly

  i dont know the person you speak
of had disney been better acquainted
with the manners and habits of society
people he might have resented this
more but he simply questioned

  aint ou a member of this club
well so is she fairfax denied all
knowledge of her anyway well this
aint my style of a club then so i dont
think ill join why in our little club
we had over a delicatessen store down
on pratt street we was all buck and
hen and bill to one another

  the situation was becoming painful
to fairfax who was afraid some one
would enter and discover him with this
fearful person and again he endeav-
ored to break away but disneys hold
on him was sure and he asked him to
be friendly enough to give his opinion
on his apparel fairfax hesitated and
hemmed a bit disney only held to him
the harder and tried to pin him down
to facts explaining that he had flitted
from store to store all by himself
buying the best he could find he was
becoming very much interested in his
account when nondas entered having
snobs



made a change to an afternoon walking
dress carrying her russian sable coat
over her arm disney saw her the mo-
ment she entered and turned to her
still holding onto fairfax

  oh there you are i called on you
but they said you were out here so i
hired a big pink autahmobeel to match
my pink tic-and here i am and he
smiled blandly at her her amusement
at his dress was great but she managed
to cover it sufficiently to avoid hurting
his feelings and gave her attention to
the fact that his grip on fairfax was
hurting that gentlemans dignity if not
his feelings

  im afraid youre hurting your
young friend mr disney fairfax
begged to be released now that disney
had found miss parkyn but disney
refused until he had introduced the two
club members he gave miss parkyns
name and then hesitated as he remem-
bered he didnt know the name of the
man he was holding

  whats your name chief 

  my name can be of no use to you
sir snapped fairfax i repeat em-
phatically i dont know you disney
began to appreciate more thoroughly
the situation and resolved to make the
most of the funny side of it

  oh is that all well my names
disney now you know me nondas
appreciation of the situation was in-
tense but she concealed her satisfaction
of it and added her drop of sarcasm to
the rapidly rising flood

  i am afraid i must agree with your
young friend mr disney your meth-
od of introduction is a bit primitive
before introducing people you ought to
find out if they desire it and as your
young friend is seemingly ashamed of
his name i should prefer not to meet
him this was a staggerer to fairfax
that he one of the very elite of the
citys aristocracy should be snubbed by
a young woman whom nearly every
member of the exclusive set had in turn
snubbed he spluttered angrily

ashamed of my name prefer not
to meet me disney looked from one
to the other not quite getting this but
feeling an apology due miss parkyn
gee i ought to be more careful

then on second thought but hes a
member of the club so he must be all
right or maybe as another thought
broke in he just said he was a mem-
ber and he took a firmer grip on fair-
fax as though to administer chastise-
ment if such proved the case go see
if hes on the square with that talk miss
parkyn i dont want to get in wrong
the first day i come out here fairfax
was fairly boiling with impotent wrath
by this time and endeavored to shake
himself free but he might as well have
tried to free himself from the grip of
an enraged bull-dog

 you why confound you but
disney only turned his sunny smile on
him which aggravated fairfax the
more

  dont get peeved archibald re-
member anything you say will be used
against you its my fault i brought
you here on this nondas who had
managed to keep her face straight
throughout burst into an uncontrollable
fit of laughter while fairfax turned
and twisted unavailingly disney look-
ing from one to the other as though to
learn from nondas what he should do
next with his victim then mrs beau-
regard arose in all her matronly dignity
and might to freeze both nondas and
disney with a look and a word but dis-
ney only wondered where she blew in
from and nondas cared little for the
matronly interference

  this has gone far enough she ut-
tered as she swept majestically into the
view of the others laura followed her
with a reproving look at nondas whom
she addressed

  nondas you should be ashamed
you know very well this is mr fair-
fax nondas turned coolly to laura
smiling very innocently

  he doesnt know me how could i
be expected to know him  fairfax
took fresh courage at the intervention
of the feminine squad and threatened
to complain to the club authorities he
turned to disney

  you sir shall be- but disney gave
him an extra shake at this threat

  shall be and again fairfax felt
his courage oozing and turned piteous-
ly to mrs beauregard for assistance
the green book album

  mrs pen i appeal to you i am
neither an athlete nor a pugilist and
this-this person is very strong sum-
moning all her dignity the lady ap-
pealed to addressed disney though
much against her better judgment as he
had not yet been introduced to her thus
putting her in the way of breaking the
conventional rules of society

  young man release that gentle-
man disney looked at mrs beaure-
gard and then turned to nondas for
permission to put this command into ex-
ecution that young lady endeavoring
to assume a dignified manner which she
was far from feeling told disney that
as fairfax seemed to know the other
ladies he must come from a respectable
family and requested for his familys
sake that he be released and he was
freed when far enough away from
disney fairfax again spoke of com-
plaint to the board of governors and
mrs pen remarked about the inadvisa-
bility of admitting anyone and every-
one to the sacred precincts whereupon
nondas applied her little whip again
pointing to fairfax

  this young man should have
thought of that before he brought his
friend in

  madam exclaimed fairfax in pro-
test but nondas cut in again

  dont call me madam i only al-
low the butcher and baker to do that
and both she and disney smiled
aside fairfax finished his sentence in a
perfect fury

  he is not my friend-he is not my
friend -not not not my friend non-
das looked almost as though she would
like to set this speech to music but
turned calmly to disney for another
thrust at fairfax

  the young man is very much hurt
by your coldness mr disney be his
friend disney crossed over to fair-
fax offering his hand which fairfax
in surprise did not deign to accept

  all right chief i dont hold any
hard feelings but fairfax was alto-
gether speechless at this turn of affairs
so disney grasped his limp hand and
shook it warmly turning to nondas
then to see if everything was all right
laura then deemed it advisable to take

a hand in the proceedings and scolded
nondas for disneys presence stating
that if the latter didnt leave immediate-
ly she and her aunt would make a com-
plaint and disney would be put out
that was sufficient for the ex-milk-
wagon driver and he promptly turned
back his cuffs turning to laura

  lady if youve got a bouncer that
wants some exercise trot him out ill
oblige him

vii

  phipps maynadiers entrance on the
scene prevented what might have hap-
pened and he was horror-stricken to
find disney present the latter turned
to him as to an old friend explaining
that he had arrived just in time to wit-
ness a nice little scrap as this lady
and he indicated miss laura is going
to have me put out of the club on
disney speaking in this friendly man-
ner to maynadier mrs pen looked as
though she would have need of smelling
salts asking him faintly if he knew
this person-which question laura
almost simultaneously chirruped fair-
fax started again with his protest
against the outrageous conduct etc
when maynadier seeing the futility of
any other explanation said with a
forced smile

  hes a great practical joker disney
is so youve all made his acquaintance
have you  fairfax denied that this
pleasure had been his

  why didnt you just shake me by
the hand and say you wanted to be my
friend and disney started as though
to grasp fairfax by the hand again but
the latter sought refuge behind the law-
yer

  phipps if that person lays a hand on
me again- but mrs beauregard was
starting for the door afraid that an in-
troduction to her would come next and
called for laura to follow suit may-
nadier detained laura for a few words
and mrs pen commissioned fairfax
to escort her to the turkish room for a
liquor brandy as she felt faint and thus
they made their escape from the detest-
ed presence maynadier turned to
snobs



iaura and nondas and disney imme-
diately became engaged in a conversa-
tion on the merits of his outfit

  youve the courage of your convic-
tion mr disney but your necktie is
shocking and she laughed happily
its almost a cravat disney looked in-
to his neck as well as the fatness of his
chin would permit and said ruefully

  i thought it was a pretty shade
nondas took him sympathetically by the
arm as she half turned him toward the
door

  then id advise you to give up
thinking altogether she looked him
over from head to foot as she added
you know you wouldnt look half bad
if you were dressed properly laura
and phipps had become interested in
this discussion by this time and laura
started to reprove nondas for speaking
to disney about his clothes thus but
this had no more effect on the independ-
ent young miss than to cause her to de-
fend her stand

  which is best to snub a person be-
cause they dont dress and act as you
do or to explain to them why other
people snub them then she turned to
the lawyer with a cynical smile for
shame mr maynadier to let a protege
at large in such a comic kit disney
was standing open-mouthed at all this
discussion about him and glancing over
his clothes in an earnest endeavor to
locate the exact difficulty with them to
him they seemed the acme of correct-
ness maynadiers denial that he had
anything to do with the purchase of the
raiment brought the question from dis-
ney as to whether maynadier also
thought them bad upon which nondas
broke in again as though she had de-
cided to take complete charge of the
misguided ex-laborer

  bad its a sartorial crime ive a
golf necktie in my locker that ill let
yon have sorry i havent shoes and
waistcoat too come along disney
looked at her trim little figure and then
at his corpulency and a smile covered
his face at the thought of his being able
to pour himself into anything of hers

  thats the way to talk he said
pat me right i was a bonehead to
blow myself before asking somebody

then he caught sight of the canehead
and the cuff-links and asked but the
bow - wow s are pretty aint they look
here and here and here and he point-
ed proudly to the trio of dogs-heads
which looked as though he were en-
deavoring to advertise a brand of ale
nondas heaved a sigh as she saw them
and resignedly remarked as she escort-
ed the big fellow off to the locker-room 

  oh i dare say theyll take them
back

viii

  left alone with maynadier laura
gave a sniff tossed her head and
walked to the door through which the
others had gone giving a final look at
the retreating form of disney as his
huge bulk moved down the hall then
she turned to maynadier with a smile
of compassion for nondas

  i wonder if she thinks hes the
duke phipps raised his eyebrows
slightly and questioned what laura
thought about it that odious person
-a duke

  i didnt say he was returned may-
nadier i merely asked you what you
thought

  well that person is no duke on
that you may depend and laura dis-
posed of disneys chances for royalty
with another toss of her head then she
turned to maynadier and with a pro-
nounced change in tone and manner
asked what sort of a person is mr
reade the lawyers answer was not
such as to inspire laura with a terrific
love for the furnace-tender but there
was the thought of the millions which
went with him and millions are very
attractive to an american society wom-
an  there is always the haven of the di-
vorce court if the bringer of the for-
tune becomes unbearable for any reason
whatever beside which theres ali-
mony and-but maynadier was de-
scribing reade to her so she awoke to
this

 reades a boy with his head
crammed full of nonsense hes got out
of society novels written bv men who
call cotillions serines and think we still
use dance cards his language is so cor-


the green book album

rect one thinks hes going to apply for
a position as butler the lady ques-
tioned as to whether reade was the
duke but was told that the promise had
been made that that gentleman was to
remain entirely incognito for a time
she pleaded but in vain for was may-
nadier going to throw away the chance
of his twenty-five thousand a year for
acting as mentor and cicerone which
was to be paid only on the condition
that the incognito was to be absolute
and thats what i wanted to tell you
he went on then with an enthusiasm
which no one would have accused him
of but which in a real man would have
appeared blase he added we can af-
ford to marry now

  oh can we there was such a
total lack of any kind of expression in
her answer that any other than phipps
maynadier would have been stunned
but to him it was like so much water on
a ducks back so he continued

  well live in london and i can dou-
ble my salary by favoring the trades-
men and contractors who supply the
walshire estates he wont be able to do
anything without me and you can jolly
well believe ill be the real duke and
he advised her to have her mother an-
nounce their wedding for the following
month  but miss laura was in no hurry
for it again she was in her air-castles
with the real duke odious as he might
possibly be for she hadnt the slightest
doubt that reade would search her out
now that he had money and she would
certainly make him think he was the
only man in the world for her no
phipps maynadier in her estimation
had been all right until she had the pres-
ent opportunity thrust before her

  you dont seem terribly keen about
our marriage somehow whats the
matter you know i care a whole lot
for you but you can hardly expect me
to do the romantic thing can you pve
known you too long however-and he
bent over and kissed her very gracious-
ly and considerately-there she was
startled out of herself by this action of
his he raised his hands as though not
knowing how else to account for this
unwonted action on his part well you
seemed to want it personally its an

awful bother to be sentimental im not
up to it i like you because youve got
sense had the little god of love been
present he would have doubled up at
this remark you know how to preside
at a dinner table you look pretty and
youre not the kind that gets talked
about

  god love the lovers among the snobs
surely no one else does and they need
sympathy for they cant see themselves
as others see them laura was again
far away from her present surround-
ings but he went on

  but sentiment thats the sort of
thing would make me marry a chorus
girl he patted her shoulder which
in itself was a great concession on his
part considering he expected to make
her his wife then he told her to run
along to her aunt as he wanted to ar-
range visitors cards for the duke and
his friend the mention of the duke
brought her back again and with all
the ingenuousness at her command she
inquired when she should meet that
party but he evaded the question clev-
erly and strolled off to the office laura
stood a moment in thought and was
starting off on another of her trips in
the clouds as she moved in the direc-
tion whence her aunt had gone when
she was confronted by reade

ix

  that gentleman with his knowledge
of the dress of society people gleaned
from his studious perusal of novels had
borrowed a riding-suit and thus was
not a half-bad looking proposition at
least so thought laura as she gave a
little start upon seeing him realizmg
that she would have him all to herself
for a moment at least reades surprise
at thus coming upon the object of his
adoration was even greater than hers
for his lovewas real he stood for a
moment unable to speak and then col-
lected himself enough to ejaculate

  miss lanvale-miss lanvale-do
you remember me she endeavored to
control her feelings but only half suc-
ceeded a fact which was not at all ap-
parent to him however
snobs



 yes-i-do-remember-you but
it cant be it-cant-be by the
time she had completed the sentence
she had regained control of herself and
was playing her part admirably he
fairly gasped with joy

  after all these months-and you re-
member a poor workman oh it is
hard to believe the assurance with
which she accepted his statement set
him on his feet in a cloud of fancy

  oh ive often thought of you and
those pleasant hours i spent in the
shops he caught her up quickly on the
time

  it was just an hour and twelve min-
utes he was fairly beside himself and
hardly knew how to proceed and laura
was not giving him any too much as-
sistance she was thinking-thinking
hard how to land him surely before
anyone else came along finally he con-
tinued in an agitated tone ive been
thinking of you for six months miss
lanvale dreaming of you but you
were miss lanvale and i was only a
poor mechanic in the shops laura be-
came virtuous in an instant almost in-
dignantly so

  you think i am like that and the
reproof in her tone cut him like a knife
that a paltry thing like social position
should make any difference to me
reade was confused and naturally put
his foot in it at once

  but she-a lady i met last night-
and he became doleful at the thought of
what nondas had said to him said you
spelled society with a double s mrs
beauregard entered on the stairway
and taking the situation in at a glance
remained quietly out of sight of the
twain on the lower step for a second
laura was nonplused by his remark
and then brightly turned to him

  it is not my fault if i am in what
other people term society it is the
man and the woman themselves which
one must look to now assured that
she had guessed the situation correctly
mrs beauregard discreetly left the
room smiling calmly she could trust
her nieces future in her hands from
what she had seen and overheard

  then you care nothing for what a
mans father might have been  reade

asked excitedly and she shook her head
with all the assurance in the world that
such a trifling thing as ancestry should
have any effect whatever on her
whereupon he proceeded to enlighten
her about his fathers very humble ex-
istence and of his own low beginning
and slow rise with long hours and hard
work arguing that he must have been
mad to have thought of her as he had
done laura had begun to purr softly
to herself by this time as she felt things
were drawing rapidly to the proper cli-
max and the smooth query of hers as
to why he should term it madness
elicited his statement that even now he
was in another mans clothes-a riding
suit which he was not even able to use
properly as he could not sit astride a
horse so he had been obliged to walk to
the club

  why this is the first time i have
ever been in a decent house ive lived
in the slums all my life then he
turned to her suddenly as even now his
presence needed an explanation and
do you think id have dared to come
into this club if i were what i was when
you met me  no im going to england
ive had some good fortune then sud-
denly he turned again towards her as
his love swelled higher if i had money
enough to- but he terminated his
speech shortly with a rueful expres-
sion but no its madness laura
spoke most encouragingly to him for
she was supported by the thought of
the millions of pounds sterling and
thats enough to make any society wom-
an courageous and he turned again
noting the expression in her eyes

  are you mad too 

  she beamed  him with all the beau-
ty at her command and fairly dazzled
him into a lovers unconsciousness i
love everything that is beautiful-even
madness

  he started again to tell her of his
love but caught himself much to her
disappointment then grasping her
hands in the height of his ardor he
asked if he might see her again that
day

  ive a box party to-night at the
opera house if you come to my box
between the acts-box d- it was all


the green book album

reade could do to control himself but
he managed to make a mental note of
the letter and releasing her hands
asked where maynadier might be
found confiding to her that these were
maynadiers clothes he was wearing
she made him promise not to say a
word to maynadier about her which
raised a question in his mind but she
stilled that very easily and then she
pointed the way to the office where he
might find the lawyer

  he bent over her hand as he took it
in his and repeated the box letter lau-
ra became slightly emotional as she re-
peated his statement

  box d between the acts and
reade left to find maynadier laura
standing with a very self-satisfied smile
congratulated herself on her triumph
for she felt it was inevitable now that
she should become the duchess of wal-
shire

x

  in the midst of lauras reveries her
aunt entered going hurriedly to her
side

  so that was the ducal bird eh hes
really very presentable although he
talks like the hero of junies love
test  laura turned on her aunt se-
verely

  youve been listening

  yes dear i have and i congratu-
late you youve got brains laura
was pleased at that and answered

  then you shall be my chaperon
through a whole london season and i
will pay for all your frocks what a
joy it is to anticipate all the pleasures
of life and to be able to spend millions
even before they are yours how many
have lived on that very exhilaration

  youre as sure of him as all that
her aunts tone made laura slightly
anxious

  you say you listened what do you
think mrs pen thought a second
and then suggested the possibility that
if reade wasnt a born fool he would
know she had read the dailies and
would naturally suspect his identity
laura was trembling from excitement
by this time and pleaded with her aunt

to secure a marriage license at once
use my first name-make it mary
lanvale and his name-now - is

reade

  and his first name laura gazed
at her aunt blankly

  i dont know

  well youll have to know to get a
marriagei license and there wasnt
much consolation in the elder womans
tone she had strolled to the door and
now saw disney talking to nondas
parkyn in one of the other rooms
turning to laura she asked her to be
nice to them for a minute or so and
find out reades first name calling
nondas in nondas came followed by
disney now wearing nondas black
knit tie of which he seemed very proud
laura fairly beamed with joy and non-
das expressed surprise at this unwonted
change in the lanvale family

  ive been thinking said laura
how silly it is for us to be cross with
one another nondas had a flash of
thought of something underlying this
speech of lauras but passed it over
as she remarked complainingly

  but you wont laugh at my jokes
here was disneys chance so he
thought so he entered the conversation

  oh go on miss nondas be friends
youre both nice girls and you oughta
get along with one another laura
drew herself up perceptibly but did
her level best to unbend so as to follow
her aunts instructions nondas mean-
time had turned to disney in wonder-
ment but smiled

  how did you learn my first name
young man disney nodded his head
in the direction of the office

  its on a typewritten list over
there nondas turned to laura with a
laugh

  and he calmly informs me that im
posted for non-payment thats grati-
tude for you and look at the tie i
gave him look at it disney threat-
ened to become a contortionist that he
might carry out this instruction and
laura gave a slight glance in order to
please nondas its made a different
man of him im going to take him into
town now and buy him some ready-
made dress clothes disneys coun-
snobs



tenance beamed even more than ever
at this statement and he shook all over
as she said hes coming to the thea-
tre with me to-night

  am i he asked

  are you well rather i wouldnt
miss seeing you in a box in dress
clothes for the first time-no-not for
something besides you may be a
duke who knows disney was al-
most caught off his guard but he as-
sembled himself as he fairly chortled

  ha ha ha me a dook then
he turned to mrs beauregard appeal-
ingly now you look like you oughta
know something about dooks that
lady felt flattered by this compliment
even though it had come from a person
with whom she couldnt bring herself
to associate and she answered though
with pretended humility

  why how should i know anything
about dukes disney looked at her a
second

  because youve got that did-
god-make-you-too expression about
you- mrs beauregard almost fainted
at this but managed to hold herself to-
gether for the good of lauras cause
and disney went on so i leave it to
ou do i look like a dook the an-
swer being rather long in coming for
mrs beauregard hardly knew what to
say when cornered this way nondas
took up the reply

  most dukes dont look like a duke
they dont have to being dukes dis-
ney turned to her a moment until he
could fairly grasp the meaning of her
sentence and then repeated his ques-
tion pointing to the chaperon

  i leave it to the lady there but
the lad- was apparently not at all at
ease

  i dont know enough about them to
say disney gave her another glance

  well you wait till you see my
friend then youll know he pouted
almost like a spoiled child and smiled
inwardly as he added i think its all
foolishness not saying which one of us
is the duke its no fun for me  can
tell you and he listened to see how
they would accept his remarks miss
parkyn came to the front with a little
tit-bit-namely

   mr disney has heard that dukes
aren t respectable but she was inter-
rupted in the course of her remarks by
the hurried entrance of bradley fair-
fax who was in a fever of excitement
and rushed to mrs beauregard almost
taking that usually calm lady off her
feet

  have you seen him i just saw him
with phipps maynadier blood will tell
mrs pen and he almost jumped in
his glee in having seen the duke
mrs beauregard almost committed a
faux pas in a query to fairfax but
laura stepped conveniently on her
aunts feet and she turned to the
younger one

  eh my dear then realizing the
near-blunder added oh yes and
subsided but fairfax was all impa-
tience that his announcement hadnt
aroused more enthusiasm

  its the young duke hes with
phipps now havent you seen him
boldly laura stepped to the front and
commandingly told a white lie tinged
with gray

  no whats he like fairfax gave
her a look almost of scorn that she
should be so weak as to ask a question
of that nature

  like a gentleman of course how
could he help it with such blood be-
hind him nondas ever ready to turn
a remark with a quip opined

  he might have let it remain behind
him most of them do disney anx-
ious that the deception innocently
started by fairfax should not be cor-
rected went directly to laura and mrs
beauregard

  no but buck looks the part what
did i tell you oh what a shock
buck exclaimed the sensitive
laura and visions of buck reade on
her marriage license flitted before her
eyes

sure thats his name returned
disney as much as to ask what was
the matter with it mrs beauregard en-
deavored to console her niece for this
sad blow

  never mind dear its probably
short for buckingham  then turning
to fairfax having learned what she had
desired she asked if he were going


the green book album

back to town and invited him to go
with them as laura passed nondas
smiled and volunteered the informa-
tion that she and disney might see
them at the theatre lauras expression
hardly indicated that she was over-
whelmed with delight at the prospect

  dont look so pleased added non-
das disney held out his hand to fair-
fax in token of absolute friendship and
that the hatchet was buried but that
gentleman resisted the offer for a sec-
ond then disney grabbed his slim
hand shaking it heartily much to fair-
faxs discomfiture

  slong chief dont forget were
pals and he allowed him to go fair-
fax joined his women friends and they
passed out without so much as turning
again to say good-by to nondas and dis-
ney he stood watching them a mo-
ment then suddenly to nondas point-
ing after the retreating trio he said-

  they cant see me with field-
glasses there was a slight pause as
he thought over the events which had
just transpired and then he blurted
out oh im not such a fool as i
look and the tinge of bitterness in his
voice made nondas raise her eyes with
an expression which had more than
sympathy in it but he was looking the
other way and missed it he looked aft-
er the others a moment and then
turned to her

  say why do you bother with me
miss nondas

  she looked up at him this time with
another expression and then glanced
past him down the hall-way where
fairfax and the ladies were just going
out to their car then her gaze came
back to him and she looked him square-
ly in the eye

  because i know what it is to be an
outsider too

xi

  it was the opening performance of
man and superman coming direct
from its long new york run and it
had the very best credentials in the
world to the local society leaders it
had been rumored that it was fright-

fully immoral consequently the opera
house manager and the company man-
ager were reaping a golden harvest and
lolling back in their office chairs smil-
ing serenely while the world-that
society world and his wife-thronged
the boxes and overflowed into the or-
chestra chairs all agog for the awful
immoralities with which mr shaw was
reputed to have crowded his scenes

  no member of the exclusive set was
better qualified to lend dignity to a box
party on an opening night than bradley
fairfax and here he was with his lit-
tle friend miss milly chasserton anx-
ious to shock her young mind but
milly having been very properly
brought up in the midst of the social
set had a mind which refused to be
shocked by any such mildly immoral
play as this of the irish wits at the
same time she gave mr fairfax to
understand that she was very nervous
about it naturally he was pleased
they were standing in the passage-
way back of the boxes waiting for
laura and the others and fairfax
was beginning to get impatient for
neither he nor innocent milly wished
to miss any of the performance in the
midst of their worries who should come
along but teasing little nondas parkyn
now milly was one of the society peo-
ple with whom nondas was acquainted
and of course she was greatly shocked
to think that such an innocent little
thing should be in the company of such
a wild young rake as bradley fairfax

  are they allowing you out with
this mr carfax she asked that
gentleman irritated enough at seeing
nondas again so soon was made doub-
ly so at the evident twist she had given
his name

  you know my name is fairfax
nondas gave him the most surprised
look in the world and really appeared
injured

  indeed i know nothing of the kind
how can i i dont know you do i
the gentleman was getting angry and
nondas was secretly enjoying his keen
humiliation before milly

  you know my name is faifax but
nondas waved him off with a pretty
gesture
snobs



  oh dont introduce yourself its
shocking bad form and besides a man
with your reputation needs a respon-
sible sponsor then she turned to mil-
ly you should see some of his
friends and her hands went up as
though in horror one of them wore
a bright pink tie and sky-blue spats
oh hes no sort of a person for you to
know this mr fairfax here milly
was at a loss how much of nondas
nonsense to take seriously but her face
was absolutely expressionless as was
her voice

  rilly how shocking are you one
of the party nondas

  yes-a party of two mr fair-
fields friend and i-and she looked
again at fairfax-the one with the
spats she brought out the final
word with a bit of spite which blended
well with the word fairfax given as he
had been during the afternoon to boil-
ing with rage came very near excelling
all his previous efforts for he was in the
presence of ladies and felt that to give
way would attract disagreeable atten-
tion in such a public place however
he managed to deny to nondas for the
severalth time that disney was a
friend of his as that individual rolled
into their presence

  nondas never did anything by halves
and when she had made the threat in
the afternoon that she was going to
have disney attired in evening dress
she knew whereof she spoke he was
now a sartorial dream and his full
shirt front made him look like a sloop
running before the wind the outfit
was fairly correct-the best nondas
could do anyway without being actu-
ally present at- the trying-on proceed-
ings disney saw fairfax the moment
he had edged himself into the space
and rushed for him with outstretched
hand grasping fairfaxs unwilling one
firmly as usual

  why there you are old pal as
soon as fairfax could release himself
he started milly upstairs for their box
fairfax whispering to her in an indig-
nant tone and endeavoring to explain
why this rude man should have had the
temerity to even speak to him

  nondas and disney left to them-

selves for a moment she looked him
over and was about to express her sat-
isfaction at the metamorphosis when
she discovered the dogs-head cane and
that killed it

  whats that for he looked at it
and then at her there was a half smile
as he gazed at the stick rather affec-
tionately and then he looked sheepish
as he caught the glance in her eye the
poor fellow was doing his best to make
good with her and he seemed to be
getting in wrong with every move

  i dunno he turned the cane-head
about so as to get a glance at all sides
and gain time to think not much
good cept to knock dust out of your
trousers and he proceeded to put it
to that use nondas grasped his hand
to put a stop to this as she feared some
one might be looking

  dress trousers arent supposed to be
dusty anyhow the head annoys me
a brilliant idea occurred to him and
he hoped to save himself again

  it matches my cuff-buttons see
and again he displayed the smaller ob-
jects

  then get some new cuff-links she
said calmly and almost coldly his dis
appointment was keen at this

  you dont care for the design
more to make him feel a trifle more at
eiase than from real interest she ex-
amined both the head of the stick and
the buttons and then smiled up at him

  well you cant discard the cuff-
links just now but youll have to choose
between that stick and me disney
gave her a close look to see if she real-
ly meant it and caught sight of fair-
fax descending the stairs from the up-
per box to learn whether the other
members of his party were coming so
he grabbed him again

  here pal wait a minute fairfax
tried to get away but disney had al-
ready proved himself the stronger one
of the two im going to make you a
present here and he held the stick
out have it the sight of the thing
horrified fairfax and nondas sup-
pressed a smile as she saw his face and
observed him try to pull away from
disney and the stick oh its a nice
cane have it and he made the man


the green book album

take it fairfax held it gingerly as
though the thing were some dangerous

explosive	 

    one doesnt carry a stick with even-
ing dress you know

  why not returned disney you
might he rude to a newsboy and you
gotta have something to protect your-
self with take it along-as fairfax
endeavored to return it seeing his ef-
forts of no use the latter started oft
taking the object with him and disney
and nondas turned their backs to laugh
at him the moment they had done so
fairfax propped the stick against the
wall of the corridor and then disap-
peared when their laughter had
ceased disney found himself getting
sentimental

  thatll always be the way when you
ask me to choose between you and any-
thing else she looked at him with a
smile about the corners of her mouth

  thats a pretty thought set it to
slow music he was taken back for a
moment but returned bravely to the
fray he had started now and was not
going to be stopped by any frivolous
speeches of the young woman upon
whom he had set his heart if she was
content to accept him not knowing his
real station all the better for both of
them in the future

  it wouldnt make any difference to
me what you asked me to give up-id
give it up and his eyes expressed a
longing sentiment which she saw
quickly

  then give up trying to be senti-
mental

  theres no use try in to dodge it
miss nondas im gone on you-clean
daffy she looked at him with the air
of a physician giving serious advice to
a patient

  when did this malady first make its
appearance

  when you blew in last night i said
to myself henry i said thats the
girl but she broke in on him before
he could go any further

  you mustnt talk about me to people
i hardly know she paused a moment
and her eyes grew more serious in a
genuine manner and he watched them
to see if there was any hope indicated

for him look here my boy she said
and she talked as though he were much
younger than she-so he was in the
experience of the life they were encir-
cled by youre an oddity a rarity and
i do like you but if youll give me some
reason for joining you in this vein ill
be obliged he shifted uneasily from
one foot to the other and felt foolish

   oh im nothin to write home about
i know but ive got a chance to be
somebody in the world now-and im
going to be then he looked at her
again im not pin-head enough to
think a girl like you is goin to fall for
me as i am now all i want to know-
and he paused the fraction of a second
to gain courage- are you strong
for anyone else she was amused at
his method of inquiry and gave him a
quizzical look

  evidently an old greek phrase
meaning has anyone seized upon my
young and tender affections-that it
but disney had gotten almost to the
popping point and was dead serious

  dont josh me miss nondas be se-
rious for a minute im in love there
it was out and the surprising part of it
was that nondas was not taken off her
feet at the abruptness of the declara-
tion  she was really interested in the
fellow and knew him well enough even
though their acquaintance had been but
of twenty-four hours duration to know
that he would say what came into his
mind at the moment this was one fea-
ture about him which she admired
there was none of the smug society
manner about him instead of being all
on the surface he was all over to use
an old expression of hers she an-
swered him coolly and easily

  well being in loves happened to
everybody dont act as though yours
were a special case but he was more
than ever anxious about it now

   youre not crazy about anybody are
you from anyone else such question-
ing would have been resented but she
seemed to enjoy it from him strange
how different men affect the same wom-
an 

   thats the one subject on which im
thoroughly sane and she looked him
squarely in the eye as she said it
snobs

  then listen and he settled himself
to propound a fact to her he was be-
coming thoroughly easy in her presence
im gunna make a man outa myself
thatll be good enough for you you
might think i cant do it but i got some-
thing  call a brain and from now on
im gunna give it a job

  even so she rejoined why should
i marry anybody ive all the money i
want and i can do almost anything i
like wouldnt i be a silly fool

  he admitted her argument but quali-
fied it unless you cared for some one
-and im gunna make you care for
some one she didnt pretend that she
didnt understand but came right to the
point at once as was her custom

  you cant do that by parroting these
snobs you see about you

  well how can i make you love me
she was highly amused at this unusual
form of love-talk from a man of his
caliber

  i dont know myself well enough to
say but as a general rule love for a
man comes from some thrill which
wakes up a part of a woman that she
didnt know existed some thrill he
looked at her in doubt of what this
might mean

  you suggest i make the statue of
liberty do a skirt-dance but you dont
tell me how

  if i knew how it could be done that
wouldnt be the way a thrill needs the
element of surprise-come along into
the box the curtains up by now and
she opened the door to the box then
he noticed his cane standing near him

  wait a minute he didnt take his
cane and he reached for it as mayna-
dier entered the passageway followed
by laura mrs beauregard and fair-
fax

  oh youre here disney said may-
nadier reades been looking all over
town for you then seeing nondas
how dyou do miss parkyn

  oh ive done much better since we
got acquainted thank you its such a
relief to be sure of ones neighbors
and she bowed to laura and the others
and entered the box disney started to
follow her but maynadier detained
him



  just a minute disney and he
closed the box door mrs beauregard
was on her way to the upper tier of box-
es followed by laura and fairfax
where they joined milly who was
watching the rise of the curtain reade
seemed anxious to see you about some-
thing whereve you been since this
afternoon 

  at a tailors gettin a new front
and he displayed himself more fully in
his dress suit they were made for an-
other feller but he fixed it over for
me kinda nice aint it then he
thought of what maynadier had said re-
garding reade whats the matter with
buck

  i dont know shall i tell him where
you are when he comes

  sure sure and he turned the
knob on the box door see you later
lots of people here to-night i want
you to meet disney said maynadier
but he cut him off in the middle of his
speech

  cant do it chief got no open
time

  im afraid im not earning my sal-
ary cant i do anything for you
nope-with a grin yes you can
-some time-when youve a spare min-
ute and he smiled again you might
wise me up on how to give a woman a
thrill and he disappeared into the box
leaving maynadier in blank amazement

xii

  at the close of the first act of man
and superman the spaces back of the
boxes were filled by their occupants
and friends of theirs who came from
various sections of the house to gossip
and comment on the play fairfax was
clearly displeased that no more of im-
morality had developed in the first act
but lived in hope that the second and
third acts would develop something
really devilish

  mrs beauregard and laura left
alone in their second tier box were
looking vainly about the house for some
sign of reade for he had not as yet
honored them with his presence and
both the ladies were beginning to fear


the green book album

that some other siren had captured the
prize keade however having learned
that disney was in box b was at that
moment knocking  the door and dis-
ney opened it to his friend still holding
the dogs head cane in his hand

  hulloa buck come ml then he
turned to nondas asking her if she
didnt remember his friend which she
admitted reade bowed to her and then
turned to his chum his voice hoarse
with excitement

  can i speak to you a minute hen-
ry-in private

 sure if miss nondas doesnt
mind and she signifying her willing-
ness that the conference should take
place the friends went out into the cor-
ridor where reade grasped disneys
hand as though he were going to lose
him for all time and in husky voice
started in

  look here henry last night you
promised me five thousand a year as
your secretary does that still stand 
he was trembling from nervous excite-
ment and worry

  you bet it does buck and the big
fellow slapped his chum on the back
and if you need more all you gotta do
is to ask for it youre the only friend
i ever had and ill go to soak for you
any time you say the word reade was
touched by this bit of sentiment and
almost broke down

  henry youre-

  can all that buck ts that all you
wanted to see me about reade nod-
ded as he was too full of gratitude to
say anything disney slapped him on
the back again well then between
you and me you neednt come into the
box you know how i feel about that
young lady-and she likes met me
common old hen disney just the
same hen disney that drove the milk-
wagon she thinks youre the dook of
course  but shes goin to be mrs dook
all right all right say buck how do i
look in the soup and fish and he
twisted about that his chum might have
a athi n the evening raiment

    hue ejaculated reade in honest
admiration of his friends appearance
disney looked at himself admiringly a
moment for he himself thought he

looked pretty well but just then he got

a glance at his hands

  my hands seem to interfere some-
how well run along buck fm busy
and he started to open the box door
again when he remembered the cane in
his hand he looked at buck as though
whether he ought to inflict the cane on
his chum and then remembered his
promise to nondas im going to give
you a present and he handed reade
the stick there thats some cane
have it  and before reade could utter
a word of protest at this generosity
disney had ducked into the box and
closed the door on the privacy of non-
das and himself

xiii

  reade gave a final look at the box
door heaving a sigh as he thought of
the big-heartedness of his old-time
friend and then wended his way to the
upper boxes looked along at the let-
ters and knocked at box d the door
opened and laura came out

youre here-at last she sighed

  youve been anxious too he
queried oh you dont know how hard
it is for me to realize yesterday i was
a mechanic with no hope of being any-
thing else-and now- and he looked
at himself this is the first time i ever
wore evening clothes do you know
how i happened to have them for to-
night and he explained to her the in-
cident of the preceding night and his
determination to sit where he could
look at her even though he might not
speak and now everything is
changed he went on this is my night
of glory and he lapsed into his society
novel style i dont know whether you
understood what i wanted to say this
afternoon-but ive enough money to
support a wife now and i can offer her
some kind of a position-so its no in-
sult to tell you i love you laura acted
her part very well simulating the neces-
sary surprise at this avowal then he
felt desperate oh i knew it was mad-
ness and as she saw he was being
scared away again she took him up
quickly
snobs



  maybe im a little mad too then
she positively beamed triumphant upon
him and took him off his feet and its
a beautiful madness reade kissed her
hands in his delight but was seen by
mrs beauregard who emerged from
box e he stepped back into the shad-
ow as though he had been caught in a
guilty act and laura rushed to hide her
head in sudden diffidence on her aunts
shoulder

  aunt phcebe will you forgive me
she cried plaintively aunt phcebe gave
her an expressive pressure which reade
couldnt see and very calmly asked
what the matter was-who this gentle-
man was laura in her most ingenuous
manner told auntie that he had asked
her to marry him and-and-she want-
ed to then came the introduction of
her fiance to her aunt

  and who is mr reade asks mrs
pendleton beauregard with all that
dignity so required of the better and
most exclusive set

  i was a mechanic last night said
he getting down to facts at once i
showed miss lanvale through our
shops six months ago and i have loved
her ever since and she- coy little
laura hung her head and now i have
an income and i have asked her to be-
come my wife mrs beauregard was
diplomat enough to take in the situation
at a glance so she patted lauras cheek

  silly romantic children and what
are you going to tell phipps mayna-
dier reades curiosity was aroused in
an instant

  what has he got to do with it  mrs
beauregard smiled blandly at his ignor-
ance as she quietly remarked 

  nothing except that hes been en-
gaged to laura for the past two years
reade was plunged into the depths of
despair in an instant

  oh if i had only known and
laura became her old self on the in-
stant before she had time to think ask-
ing testily

  what difference does it make to
you 

  hes my friend said reade i
should have told him i loved you so
that all would have been fair and
square mrs beauregard gave him a

look which would have done credit to
the regulation stage mother-in-law

  young man that speech belongs be-
tween the covers of a book-and paper
covers at that there is no fair and
square in love-making fairfax en-
tered from the stairs leading to the
lower boxes the former at once noted
reade coming up to him beamingly
very apparently looking for an intro-
duction

  oh-er-i dont believe ive had the
honor he began when mrs beaure-
gard very ungraciously turned to the
men-for she had seen the approach of
fairfax and deliberately turned her
back so as to avoid the necessity of in-
troducing him

  mr reade-mr fairfax fairfax
thought he was exceptionally clever
when he realized that the other was in-
troduced as mr reade because he
wished to remain incognito and after
acknowledging the introduction re-
marked with a smile and a rising inflec-
tion accompanied by a slight raising of
the eyebrows to let the others know he
knew the circumstances quite so
and shook hands with whom he sup-
posed was a member of royalty he
hung about for a moment endeavoring
to enter the conversation mrs beau-
regard getting more nervous until she
could stand it no longer her lips tight-
ened perceptibly as she turned to the
intruder

  please get my fan in box d brad-
ley she ordered and when he had left
on that mission she devoted her atten-
tion to milly who had been hovering
about expectantly after a moments
thought during which she could find no
reason for sending the little minx off on
an errand she snappingly said

  miss chasserton-mr reade and
milly was in the seventh heaven of de-
light for this was the first member of
royalty she had ever seen but milly
was a very knowing young miss also

  mr reade-oh yes with a sug-
gestive smile which was far from be-
ing lost on either laura or mrs beau-
regard and she continued as though
to monopolize the conversation and
how do you like the united states mr
reade laura was becoming pro-


the green book album

voked and bad been thinking of some
excuse to rid them of milly

  milly i think elsie wants to speak
to you miss millv however was a far
wiser bird than fairfax and would not
be limed so she started on the conver-
sation with reade again the other
women were about to give up the situa-
tion in despair when fairfax returned
with the information that mrs beau-
regards fan was nowhere to be found
in the box then he saw it in her hand
milly giggled at this and turned to
fairfax to let him know that she had
been wiser than he

  laura told me that elsie wanted to
speak to me but i knew that she was
only pulling my leg mrs beauregard
held up her hands in horror

  really milly you are giving me a
great shock but milly turned to reade
knowingly

 oh mr reade knows what i
mean and the conversation drifted in-
to dangerous channels which led them
to close the topic of who was the real
duke with reade trying to hide his
confusion

  theres no use trying to hide it mr
reade we know that person with non-
das parkyn isnt any duke

  why of course we do chirped
fairfax we can tell a gentleman from
a-a-a-

  bounder said milly supplying the
word which reade was afraid to utter
reade beginning to take in the situa-
tion became almost tragic about it as
he asked if they really believed he was
the duke and turning to laura asked
if that was the reason why she had ex-
pressed love for him laura thinking he
was only covering the real situation so
as to deceive the others pushed milly
into one of the boxes while mrs beau-
regard took fairfax away from the
scene and reade uttered a cry of de-
spair as he began to realize that laura
cared nothing for the man-only the
title laura fully to convince herself
asked him point-blank

  are you the duke

  as reade saw his chances of claim-
ing the woman to whom he had unre-
servedly given his love slipping from
his grasp he became almost frantic

  no no no he answered in re-
sponse to her direct question and if
that is why you are willing to marry
me- laura broke in again still fear-
ful that she might commit some horrible
blunder if he really were the duke and
were testing her yet she was also fear-
ful that he was telling the truth her
position was a desperate one-for her

 how can you insult me so-oh-
oh and she was on the point of weep-
ing real tears this time but reserved
them for later on

  you-you didnt think i was he
pleaded again the simulated pleading
on her part

  i-i-how can you how can you
and you love me for myself -oh
laura laura and he took her in his
arms holding her tightly while miss
laura heaved her whole frame in a
splendid imitation of a paroxysm of
emotion that he might know the depth
of her grief and love he soothing her
the while bernard shaw never wrote
a neater lying comedy than laura was
exemplifying behind the doors of the
boxes as they stood in their embrace
maynadier came upon them

xiv

 for a moment maynadier stood
transfixed absolutely unable to under-
stand why the woman to whom he had
been engaged for two years should be
in the arms of another man and partic-
ularly this one he drew closer then
with clenched teeth and spoke in a cold
rage

  laura reade released her quietly
as he heard her name called but the
tone told him that something wfas about
to happen and he turned to see the
newcomer

  maynadier-im-im sorry im
truly sorry but you had to know some
time the lawyer gave him an icy
stare as he questioned what the some-
thing might be which he would have to
know and reade told him

  please dont make me laugh he re-
plied but his face gave no indication
that he was inclined to that pastime
except for a cynical expression on it
snobs



laura lanvale love you a mechanic
out of a shop love you  reades fists
clenched almost imperceptibly at this
implied insult but maynadier paid no
attention to that fact and went on with
a harsh laugh why you utter ass
shes done just what disney expected
she thinks youre the duke love you
fool get out of the way and then he
turned to laura as tawing paid enough
attention to reade but that young man
was on his dignity in a moment resent-
ing the tone in which maynadier ad-
dressed miss lanvale

  dont come any of your cheap
ajax - defying - the - lightning poses
around here said maynadier turning
back to him miss lanvale is engaged
to me-and youre not wanted get
out he whirled reade out of the way
and took the surprised laura by the
arm even now she was not sure but
that the whole thing was a test for her
sincerity and yet she couldnt under-
stand how maynadier could know any-
thing of it and if so how he could lend
himself to the trick now laura dont
make a silly chump of yourself and
have the whole town laughing at you
the other fellow is the duke then he
wheeled about at reade again youve
got a cheek pretending youre a duke

  this was too much for reade for
had he not in every way he possibly
could without breaking faith with his
chum led people to believe that dis-
ney was the titled one at all events his
conscience was clear and if others had
made the error it was through no fault
of his so he turned on maynadier in
white heat

  oh you snob you cad do you
think the whole world is as base as you 
dont you believe there is one decent
motive one pure thought one unselfish
love in the world maynadier smiled
grimly at what he was pleased to call
reades fine heroics

  dont be an ass my boy do you
sincerely believe miss lanvale prefers
you to me-for yourself alone  and
he gave emphasis to the phrase as the
lady novelists have it reades honest
mind could conceive of nothing else
than her love for him for he had so
idolized her in his dreams and thoughts

that he couldnt believe it was only his
supposed title she had been angling for

  she loves me he almost wailed
she loved me when i was- and in a
second of hesitation his voice became
bitter with anguish a mechanic in a
shop maynadier laughed at him and
he felt like thrashing the man on the
spot only miss lanvales presence and
the knowledge that she would be
dragged into undesirable publicity pre-
vented him but his temper was fast get-
ting beyond his control and he realized
it he swore to maynadier that laura
was not of the world he believed in
that she was true and faithful to him
for himself and dared maynadier to
test her to tell her he was not the
duke even to get disney to tell her
to use any method necessary to disabuse
her mind of the idea and ended by de-
claring flatly that he was not the duke
and that disney was he turned to
laura

  i believe in you im only doing this
to satisfy him-pointing to maynadi-
er wait disney is downstairs ill
bring him here and he was off to get
his friend immediately he was gone
laura turned on her fiance accusing
him of trying to fool her for the pur-
pose of seeing how she would act if she
thought reade was not the duke thus
do drowning men cling to a straw may-
nadier smiled at this idea of hers which
he termed very ingenious but a trifle
shopworn and was about to attempt
to convince her beyond all doubt when
reade started up the stairs with disney
as he heard them coming he said
quickly

  it was a big temptation to you
laura and i wouldnt stand in your
way if he was the duke you could
marry him like a shot it would be vel-
vet for me then the two friends were
on the scene reade excitedly hurrying
disney

  now tell them henry tell them
which one of us is the duke disney
showed unmistakable annoyance at be-
ing thus dragged from the side of the
woman he loved and called upon to
confess to a secret which he was most
desirous of keeping and accused may-
nadier of being responsible for the sit-


the green book album

uation all of which the latter denied
goin on to explain how he found laura
and reade and that the lady had ex-
pressed her love for reade simply be-
cause she believed him to be the real
duke

  of course you wouldn t blame any-
one for preferring the duke of wal-
shire he added as a final shot the
which made all three of them wince but
disney was inclined to be pugnacious
and his fighting spirit was several de-
grees nearer the surface than when he
stepped on the landing it began to look
like a storm with maynadier in the very
center of it

  you say you wouldnt blame anyone
for preferring the dook of walshire
disney looked straight at maynadier
dye think its very nice for me to
know that being what i am and he
diplomatically tried to cover his posi-
tion ive got to look out for my own
affairs he turned to laura in an off-
hand manner it wont hurt you to do
a little guessing she looked at him in
confusion of mind

  but you-you cant be the duke
disney was inclined to emit a guffaw
of laughter at this but wisely refrained

  thats a good way for you to look at
it thats the way i want all of you to
look at it maynadier was entirely dis-
gusted with the whole affair by this
time and strode directly to disney with
fire in his eyes

  well i resign get somebody else
for your five thousand pounds a vearl
disney was surprised at this but may-
nadier kept on im not going to see
miss lanvale deceived into a marriage
with a fellow she doesnt care a rap
about ive photographs-signed photo-
graphs to prove whos the duke and
he turned to laura as he added you
wait until to-morrow ill show them to
you at this threat disney was in dis-
may for he wanted above all things to
keep his position a secret until he should
be convinced of nondas love for him-
self the man until he should have an
opportunity to work up that thrill he
pleaded with the lawyer to maintain the
secrecy agreed upon stating that he
would tell miss lanvale if she would
promise not to repeat it but that he was

  iti love himself and didnt want a girl
to marry him simply because he was a
dook maynadier told him to go
ahead and he would answer for her si-
lence

xv

  well then  im the honorable hen-
ry lancaster morpeth orth knight
commander of the bath knight of the
garter knight of the thistle baron
fitz-cairn earl of flint and dook of
walshire thats me she caught dis-
neys arm in a frenzy

  youre not lying youre not playing
a game youre not trying to test me
disney gave her a look of disgust as he
said sullenly

  think id memorize all that for
nothing reade watching laura as
she caught disneys arm and the varied
expressions which had come over her
countenance awoke from his stupor as
she turned to him and asked if this
were true

  of course it is i never said i was a
duke and im not i dont want you
if you think im the duke he hadnt
long to wait for his answer

  well thats fortunate returned the
young lady as he staggered under the
blow but disney was at his side and
patted him affectionately to alleviate the
suffering cruel as laura could be
when thwarted in any purpose she was
immediately sorry in her own narrow
little way for what she had said and
added impulsively oh im truly sor-
ry for the part ive played but it was
such a temptation-the first lady in
england that means an awful lot to a
woman im-sorry t

  good god sorry reades head
was in his hands and his frame was
shaking with his broken feelings

  she turned apologetically to mayna-
dier asking his forgiveness but that
gentleman cared little for what had hap-
pened so long as he was still to have
her and eased her mind in a moment
this brought reade out of his stupor
again and he sprang at maynadier like
a panther shouting that if he couldnt
have her no one else would and espe-
cially not maynadier disney caught
snobs



reade and pulled him off the other
telling him to steady himself but reade
was beyond control of his passion now
and again threw himself on the lawyer
who was ready for him this time and
threw him to one side easily

  dont come trying any of your
mechanic muscle on me my boy i can
box dont forget that handle a couple
like you and he smoothed out his coat
where reade had mussed it up turning
to laura to explain more of the past
events reade was positively a maniac
by this time he had lost all reason the
only thing he knew was that he had
been deprived of the woman he loved
by the man he hated and he was eager
for vengeance in whatever form it came
handiest as he recovered his balance
where maynadier had thrown him he
shouted

  you devil you rotten sneering
devil handle that handle that
hardly realizing it he had grabbed the
dogs-head cane which disney had
given him shortly before and as he
spoke brought it down on maynadiers
head the latter staggered under the
crushing effect of the blow and fell
backwards towards the stairs leading to
the lower boxes laura and disney
rushed to his aid at once the latter do-
ing some tall thinking at the same time
while reade awakened from his mad-
ness by the act stared dully into va-
cancy and dropped the stick where he
stood then he looked to see what the
result was of the blow he had given
laura was hysterical by this time and
screaming loudly but disney took her
in his arms and carried her from may-
nadiers side to the first tier of boxes
assuring her that her fiance was only
stunned and that his heart was all right

  the occupants of the other boxes
aroused by the disturbance came rush-
ing into the corridor and disney im-
mediately commanded the situation to
the best of his ability assuring every-
one that maynadier would soon regain
consciousness but telling no one what
had occurred nondas strove to comfort
laura but that was an impossibility in
the midst of the excitement reade ap-
peared endeavoring to get out but
laura saw and stopped him

  you shant get away if he dies ill
make them hang you she shouted
disney was thoroughly disgusted by
this time in his varied career he had
seen so many knocked out and had had
such good experience telling whether a
man had a chance for his life or not
that he could not conceive why such a
disturbance should be made

  youre like a lot of damn-fool kids
he shouted hes not going to die keep
still about how it happened miss lan-
vale or maynadierll lose his job with
me-twenty-five thousand a year dont
forget that that statement quieted
her disney turned to reade as people
began to flock in from the orchestra
chair get out buck quick but the
advice came too late for his escape was
blocked and he could only cower in
the corner fairfax was of course on
hand to see what the matter was and
had picked up the walking-stick recog-
nized it as being that which disney had
tried to force on him earlier in the
evening and took it downstairs to
where the others were grouped

  laura having been quieted by dis-
ney nondas turned to him and in a
whisper asked him if he had done it
laura now started to explain to non-
das about the dukeship and disney
peremptorily shut her up reminding her
of her promise laura then bethought
her of maynadier and rushed up the
stairs to him while nondas turned to
reade who had slunk back in a corner

  well youve made a pretty mess of
it my boy she whispered to him for
one day of ducal splendor the fact
that he was disneys friend made her
endeavor to protect him by whispering
though she couldnt refrain from letting
him know how she felt about it brace
up now its your time to be heroic and
noble

  she turned from him to see fairfax
rushing in with the blood-stained stick
and shake it at disney as he shouted

  its murder murder this asser-
tion threw all the onlookers in a panic
but the tinsely arrival of sergeant mc-
nutt in his policemans uniform quelled
it as he asked what the trouble was

  murders the matter shouted the
trembling fairfax still holding the


the green book album

stick look here and he pointed out
the prostrate form of maynadier to
which mcnutt rushed disney turned

roughly to reade

  you fat-head get out but reade
only stared at him stupidly mcnutt re-
turned and immediately seized fairfax
asking for the truth whereupon that
gentleman showed him the sticky and
mcnutt saw the blood upon it fairfax
pointed to disney

  thats the man its his stick

  oh damn that stick grunted dis-
ney

xvi

  reade groaned in despair as he saw
the turn affairs were taking and started
to explain but disney grabbed him
hustled him through tho crowd and
shouted to him to get a doctor mcnutt
seized disney to prevent him follow-
ing reade who made good his escape
this time he held the stick up to dis-
ney asking if it were his

  it was but i dont want it any more
you can have it

  you wont need it where youre go-
ing said mcnutt come along with
me disney questioned mcnutts rea-
son for this move and the sergeant
stated assault and battery with intent
to kill was the charge then turning to
fairfax he asked that gentleman if he
had seen the act laura having re-
turned from maynadiers side started
to explain but disney again reminded
her of her promise and mcnutt in-
formed him that he was intimidating a
witness and asked laura for her name

  oh you make me weary the mans
only stunned hell come to in half an
hour and he wont want it to get in the
newspapers drop it will you but
mcnutt had made up his mind that he
would get disney so he turned to fair-
fax note-book in hand

  you prefer charges against this
man fairfax nodded his time had
come to avenge the insults which he be-
lieved disney had heaped on him at the
club house that afternoon and he was
not slow to take advantage of them

  name please

  bradley fairfax  charles

street he responded and i hope you
hang him

  naughty naughty returned dis-
ney smiling at the fellow mammall
have to wash your mouth out with soap
dont be rude to your little playmate
mcnutt turned savagely on disney he
was not accustomed to such flippancy
from prisoners-especially those who
frequented opera boxes and he couldnt
quite fathom disneys indifference

  your name said the officer seizing
him had better be straight too

  well its not mcnutt thank god
mcnutt gave him a rough shake at this
implied slur on his name

  you give me your name disney
was nettled at the shaking mcnutt gave
him

  ill give you a swift punch in the
eye if you do that again everyone
was aghast at this speech including the
redoubtable mcnutt he gasped a sec-
ond

  resisting an officer hey ill soon
settle you bo whats your name
he gave disney a still harder shake
upon which that gentleman promptly
knocked mr mcnutt to the floor
mcnutt was up in a second and the
ethers cleared away to let the two ath-
letes have it to themselves and from
fear that some one of them might be
hurt by mistake as mcnutt arose he
drew his billy and started at disney
savagely but the latter wrenched it
from the officers grasp and threw it on
the floor laughing at him

  i didnt drive a milk-wagon for
nothing now shake me again you big
irish stiff and disney drew back into
a pugilistic attitude waiting for the on-
slaught of his opponent

  now it wasnt so much the fact
that disney had resisted him as an of-
ficer insulted his uniform and the en-
tire police department of the city as
that lie had cast reflections on the land
of his birth and that no irishman can
or will stand for without losing his
temper thus seeing that he had more
than his match on his hands and see-
ing no one in the crowd who was worthy
to call on for assistance mcnutt drew
his revolver

  now you come with me
snobs



  nix on the gun-play you put that
back where it belongs said disney
coolly as he heard some of the women
scream it had gone a little further than
he had bargained for and he didnt
want to be the cause of any theatre
panic youre frightening the women
soak that gun or ill take it away from
you here was another insult to the
police force who ever heard of a man
deliberately taking a revolver from an
officer especially when the man was un-
armed mcnutt advanced on his man
sure now that he had him where he
wanted him but keeping the gun before
him and leveled at disney there was
a moments pause as the men glared at
one another but disney was much the
cooler of the two and there was an
amusingly-serious glint in his eyes as
he looked at mcnutt and at the same
time thought quickly suddenly he
sprang at his opponent and the scene
developed into a rapid-fire wrestling
match during which process disney
twisted mcnutts gun arm behind him
and the weapon dropped to the floor
as he heard the revolver strike he
quickly reversed mcnutts arm and be-
fore the latter was aware of what was
happening disney had run him across
the corridor and out shouting after
him

  better call the reserves copper
nondas had bravely stood the excite-
ment all this time hoping against hope
that disney would come out victor and
now that he had given her her wish she
staggered and almost fainted disney
seeing this rushed to her side and
caught her in time holding her close to
him

  why-why whats the matter
the revolver she faintly replied
disney picked it up

  let me make you a present of it
miss nondas she smiled at this re-
covering her senses and turned to him

  you-youll have to forgive me
and she smiled again ive just remem-
bered im a woman-and not an epi-
gram machine-i-i-i had-a thrill
a thrill -a thrill disney was do-
ing some tall thinking but you said
that- he paused a moment again
but it wasnt that kind of a thrill was

it she turned to him with decision in
her face and voice

  yes it was -youre a man-a real
man with red blood -yes it was he
gasped as he almost lost his balance at
this statement

  my good lord -you mean you-
you-you-care for me  his conversa-
tion was coming in bunches but he was
getting to the point rapidly so he con-
cluded youll marry me she looked
up at him with an inviting smile

  try asking me-and see

xvii

  disney was about to follow this sug-
gestion and take her in his arms when
mcnutt burst in again followed by four
of his fraternity all with drawn clubs
nondas and disney saw the quintette at
the same time and she held tightly to his
arm mcnutt seemed even more furious
than when he went sailing out

  thats the guy and he pointed to
disney but the latter was busy patting
nondas hand and not worrying about
what the coppers thought however as
a matter of form he queried 

  goin to run me in copper the of-
ficers surrounded disney in a threaten-
ing manner as though he were the very
lowest form of a criminal mcnutt drew
out a pair of hand-cuffs holding them
towards disney

  hold out your hands said that rep-
resentative of the law

  not even to oblige a man named mc-
nutt and disney smiled his prettiest
at him not in a million years go find
the nearest river and jump in copper
what this additional insult might have
led to is a question but phipps mayna-
dier staggered down the stairs his head
bandaged and looking very squeamish
the crowd looked pityingly at him as
he leaned on the shoulders of the two
men disney saw him

  hello phipps glad its no worse
he called these coppers think i
slashed you and they want to know my
name but maynadier was thinking
only of getting hold of reade now
let it drop phipps ill make it worth
your while and let me introduce my


the greek book album

future wife phipps and he presented

nondas who was all smiles m fact in
the few seconds since she had given
herself to disney she seemed to have
assimilated some of his method of smil-
ing all over guess shed like to know
my name too so you d better tell ev-
erybody-in full this copper especial-
ly indicating mcnutt would like it
but maynadiers head was in no condi-
tion to remember the full list of dis-
neys titles so he renigged mcnutt
however misunderstood maynadiers
meaning and argued

oh i knew it a regular crook
however maynadier wasnt so far gone

that he couldnt deny this so he spoke
up like a little man

  no a regular duke officer that
gentleman is the duke of walshire
everyone was amazed at this and none
more than nondas parkyn

  disney turned to her taking her in
his arms

  not bad for thrill number two
eh he asked joyously  just didnt
want it to be thrill number one thats
all and he sealed the bargain in the
customary old-fashioned manner ca
ing nothing for what the onlookci
might think as a matter of fact neither
did nondas

the combs teeth

one of eddie foys youngsters is given to cute remarks recently his mother

reinhardt

the greatest producer in
the world to-day


by

lucy france pierce

max reinhardt the german genius of the
stage is reported to be planning a visit to amer-
ica soon it is hoped we will have an oppor-
tunity of witnessing some of the strange and
stupendous spectacles which this titan of the
theatre is producing

max reinhardt the great
german producer stood one day
in the center of that vast coli-
seum in london called the olympia
an international horse-show had just
closed the arena was covered with
tan bark strewn with confetti and
cambric flags and gaudy paper flow-
ers it was like a great ballroom
which lay in a superfoetation of de-
bris the morning after a riotous mas-
querade

  to-day it is a tawdry circus
reinhardt said turning to a friend
to-morrow it will be a-cathedral

  what-this whole structure
the other gasped

  this whole structure the pro-
ducer laughed as he dug his hands

into his pockets and let his eye roam
from beam to beam he shook his
long black curly mane and laughed
again as a boy would-as a boy who
was bragging that he could change
all the animals in the arena into kings
and queens or a heavenly choir by
the merest touch of his wand

  reinhardt kept his word it was
not as swift a transformation as one
would expect from the artist of a
thousand tricks as berliners ador-
ingly call him but under his wizard
touch the cathedral rose-the most
amazingly impressive mock cathedral
in all the world and on its movable
stage in the center is being enacted
a pantomimic spectacle called the
miracle which has set all england
  the green book album

agog just as a few seasons ago all germany gasped over
reinhardts wonderful production of cedipus rex in a
circus ring

  as the cathedral grew out of the tan bark of yesterday
reinhardt sat at the end of the mighty structure on a dais
giving his directions through a megaphone like a general
on the field of battle two thousand performers had been
gathered together and drilled to enact the stirring pictures
of volmoellers big drama-five hundred choir singers two
hundred musicians to give humperdincks exquisite inter-
ludes

  the great stage in the center literally rose and fell as the
settings of the massive scenes were changed and the gen-
eralissimo stood at the end shouting his commands and
the concourse swayed and moved and danced to the magic
of his words as if that great assemblage of artists were a
single unit pulled by a single string volmoeller the au-
thor sprang to his feet thrilled by the genius of the man
beside him

reinhardt the man

  one would scarcely have picked him out in a crowd
as a leader of men dreamer though he is a man of the ar-
tistic laboratory reinhardt is gifted with the executive
skill of one bora to command his black eyes flash fire
under stress of excitement when the brain begins to teem
with inspiration yet his sturdy frame his bold bismarckian
features betray no hysteria-only the poise and balance of
a man who never loses himself he has the gift of teutonic
reserve united with the idealism of a master-artist-such
a one as unfolds great canvases to the world-heroic in
size bewildering in color spiritualized in meaning

  ah volmoeller sighed he is wonderful as the au-
thor spoke he seemed to be walking on air he could
scarcely comprehend it was his own work the thing of
his fancy had been touched by the wizard vitalized given
the breath of life with a setting as awe-inspiring as the
silent everlasting hills themselves

  and then the premiere came the massive doors of the
cathedral were flung open the public crowded into seats
arranged on three sides of the altar as in the naves of a
real temple and as the action of the miracle unfolded
itself at that altar-disclosing the spectacular adventures
of a romantic nun-it seemed to them as if they were silent
witnesses of a tragedy in real life and that the mimes with
their painted faces the russian dancers the endless musi-
cians were but a part of the congregation itself thus rein-
hardt seeks to deceive his public momentarily into the be-
lief that each one is a unit in a moving event in life and
each one comes away lifted out of himself dazed by the
wonder of it
max reinhardt

               

       i shall go to america

  america reinhardt ejaculated in perfect english
when the topic was casually broached i shall go there
some day and his eyes grew dreamy over the prospect
it is the country where one may produce spectacles on a
larger scale than in europe and in a natural setting no
subterfuge-no tricks will be necessary

  any intelligent man may put a small play on a small
stage he went on it is very simple but a classic-that
requires the setting of the sky itself the background of the
virgin forest the open arena where real deeds have moved
-and most of all it requires one who is able to grasp the
details of a big deed in the palm of his hand

he started a new school

 already the rumor has gained credence that rein-
hardt will shortly resign his position as director of the
deutches theatre in berlin to accept a permanent position
in the united states a large sum has been subscribed by
a committee of german-americans to bring reinhardt to
this country for the purpose of promoting what is known
as arena drama

  this does not mean that the german public has been
lax in appreciating reinhardts genius in fact the arena
idea had its inception in berlin itself after the directors
thrilling production of sophocles cedipus rex awak-
ened germany to the powerful impetus which he was giv-
ing to new romanticism from that hour there sprang a
school of transcendental realists with reinhardt as leader
known as the secessionists

  these new romanticists decry all problematical and lit-
erary plays and so-called idea drama as tiresome and be-
wildering twaddle having no place in the theatre at all
they have broken away from all genre plays with so-
called moral social or historical purposes they preach the
doctrine of dramatic art for arts sake only they maintain
that art should be unhampered by literary demands and
that the manner of presentation is of vastly more impor-
tance than the subject matter they maintain also that the
power of the stage lies not in its attitude toward the prob-
lems of life but in the artistic form with which those
problems are clothed

  the purpose then of secessionism is primarily to give
delight and amusement to stir the emotions to appeal to
the senses and to ignore the perplexities of existence the
theatre should according to the new creed become an
arena for the fascinating spectacle of the passions the
followers of this movement assert that in the past the
classics-especially shakespeares plays-were never en-
the green book album

joyed because of the careless indifferent manner of pres-
entation and that a masterly presentment of masterpieces
is all that is necessary to revive the dormant taste for

romanticism

plan two big arenas

  thus when it became evident that there was no theatre
or auditorium in germany large enough to house classics
on the scale which reinhardt desired the wizard was driv-
en to give his first great production in the ring of a circus
then there arose the ambition among the romanticists to
establish a fund for the building of an arena theatre
reinhardt glowed with delight over such a project and
to that end a movement is on foot for the building of two
huge stadia one in berlin another in munich patterned
after the great greek amphitheatres where the spectators
will be permitted to sit on four sides of the enclosure and
the action of the drama will transpire on a stage in the cen-
ter of the arena

  meantime the college stadia at harvard berkeley and
syracuse and the classic productions being given in them
from time to time have attracted the attention of rein-
hardt to be able to give a series of huge performances in
these arenas is the directors ambition

  the classic and romantic drama is being fostered by
american universities in a way which puts europe to the
blush he observed americans have never allowed
romanticism to be shoved into a decline it is strange and
wonderful that the new country should foster the highest
ideals of expression-with a return to the greatest classic
art

  if the proper avenue is opened very little persuasion
will be necessary to bring reinhardt to this country his
advent will mean much for american drama the wizard
has spread his power over austria russia scandinavia
and england already only france has turned a cold
shoulder to him chiefly for the reason that the taste of
the parisian public seemed to tend solely toward uncom-
promising realism

  there is something so sweeping and vital about his work
that descriptive and critical writers have turned away from
their task awed by the bigness of what they beheld these
seven great productions are sophocles  cepidus rex
shakespeares midsummer nights dream and ham-
let  produced in berlin sumurun a bewildering oriental
pantomime set to music produced in the savoy theatre in
london the miracle produced at the olympia in lon-
don strauss rosenkavalier produced in dresden and of-
fenbachs die schone helena produced in munich

  sumurun the choreographic drama by frederick freska
max reinhardt

now running in london and destined to be brought to the
united states is a production on a somewhat smaller scale
than the director favors yet what it lacks in size and
scope it makes up in wonder of detail for it overflows
from curtain to curtain with perpetual mysterious charm
faithfully oriental voluptuous magnificent and artistic to
the last degree it was this over-abundance of correct and
exquisite detail combined with the histrionic and scenic
scope of a classic which made berlin condemn reinhardts
production of mid-summer nights dream as over-baked
they thought it too elaborate too extreme but the wizard
is full of surprises he gave them hamlet with simplic-
ity so exaggerated that the very chilling hardness the em-
phasized drabness of the tragedy stirred them to wonder
just as the high lights of the fantastic comedy had blinded
them with their color

his greatest

 cedipus rex marked the high-water line of rein-
hardts power to have beheld that tragedy was to have
been transported to early greece to have become for the
moment a theban non-combative as it were but never-
theless part and parcel of the great moving spectacle itself
there were neither curtain nor foot-lights to disturb real-
ity on the exposed stage rose a massive palace with steps
which descended into the circus-ring itself bereft of the
trappings of an ordinary stage it became a spectacle in
which the public outside the arena seemed to acquire a
personal interest surprise after surprise stirred them as
they sat watching they were cast first in stygian dark-
ness out of the gloom altar fires suddenly flamed up burn-
ing splendidly on either side of the palace kindled by
naked youths who seemed to emerge from among the audi-
ence itself when the plague-ridden mob flowed into the
arena from behind the benches of the public those who
looked on were thrilled by the magnificence of their attack
as if they too were theban citizens plunged headlong into
a cauldron of passion

  and all the while if one looked sharply one might have
observed the god of the machine a middle-aged broad-
shouldered man baton in hand standing at the main en-
trance conducting the shrieking mob as if it were an
orchestra and releasing it in divisions as if it were an army
-and the little man with the baton was reinhardt com-
mander-in-chief 

as a director

  as a director he is strenuous and indefatigable every
day he attends rehearsals of a constantly changing reper-
toire in two berlin theatres rehearsals of a theatre chorus
  the green book album

of understudies consultations with the assistants in his
dramatic school appointments with playwrights and scene
painters yet nothing is neglected every phase of his work

receives his personal attention

  in preparing a text he takes great liberties casts aside
precedent and tradition unless it suits his purpose but he
blends the largeness of conception of the ancient and
classic drama with the fineness and correctness of modem
dramatic stagecraft-producing an effect at once stupen-
dous and convincing

the cathedral

  the success of the miracle in london-called the
greatest spectacle ever seen in the metropolis-inspires
crowds daily to invade the cathedral and examine the
construction and working of reinhardts stage the vast
platform of the stage itself rises and falls into a subter-
ranean trap from which forty thousand tons of earth were
removed in its construction and half a million bricks
built in

  there are no wings so-called or stage-doors behind
the scenes is a vast cave reached by means erf under-
ground passages lofty enough to permit the entrance of
horses there are dressing-room accommodations for two
thousand actors and a storage room large enough to hang
seven thousand costumes one of the most thrilling mo-
ments in the action occurs when the vast gothic cathedral
housing the audience is cast into complete darkness and
out of the trap wherein rests the stage a pine-clad moun-
tain rises in full view

  presto the audience cannot go to the mountain but the
mountain will come to them-on wheels volmoeller ex-
claimed laughingly as he described it an extraordinary
idea you say yes-and believe me it is wonderfully car-
ried out and he smiled absently as his mind drifted to
the wizard who had touched the arena with his wand and
brought from out of the earth a miracle of stage crafts-
manship
a short story of stage life by a well-known actor

almost through bill  said i
slipping on my coat which bill
had allowed me to hang- up in his
property-room the museum he called
it while the show was on

  pretty near said bill got to
straighten up for to-morrow

  the curtain was down it had been
raised and lowered at least a dozen
times in response to the thunders of ap-
plause that had come from the packed
auditorium

  the glittering assemblage of fashion-
ably dressed men and women was filing
slowly out of the theatre taxicabs and

motors were rushing up and away to
take the laughing theatre-goers to the
cafes where in a few moments the new
dancers name would be on every
tongue

  it had been a wonderful feverish
night of triumph for the little russian
dancer for there was no question in the
minds of anyone but that her art was a
revelation

  the hardened first-nighters had split
their gloves in their frantic applause
the death-watch had sat up and no-
ticed as the house policeman had put
it and even the rival managers assem-


the green book album



bled in the lobby-and who had come
prepared to tolerate the newest importa-
tion-were forced to acknowledge in
an undertone to each other  t m afraid

shes a hit	t

  back on the stage the change from
the moment-before brilliantly lighted
palace of the play to the dark walls
where the palace et was now leaning
was very marked and it offered a strik-
ing contrast to the noisy lobby in front

   the glare of the lights changed to the
black gloom of the unlighted stage-un-
lit save for a single incandescent lamp
shining just outside the property-room

  the members of the company were
all swallowed up in their dressing
rooms changing for the street

  just outside of the madatncs dress-
ing room a little group of reporters
were patiently waiting in the dark to
have a word with the dancer

  the door opened throwing a glare
of light on the group of newspaper men
and the dancers secretary-a little
frenchwoman appeared to tell them
that madame begs to be excuse she
very tired to-day to-morrow she see
you all at the hotel

  in the morning ventured the
globe man

  no no said the little french-
woman not in the morning madame
will see no one in the morning but to-
morrow in the afternoon madame bid
you all a very good evening

  the door closed gently and the re-
porters each of whom was eager to get
a good story for his paper filed quietly
by the property-room door and out into
the night

  who was that bunch  asked bill
as he saw the shadowy forms pass the
museum door

  reporters on the different papers
looking for a story from the dancer
said i

  judging from the quiet sneak they
made i guess they didnt get it he
muttered

  no i guess not i replied

  thats where youve got the bulge
on em said bill i read your column
every day and you sure have got
some interesting stuff in it its a funny
thing that none of em ever hit upon this

idea of yours-takin off your coat and
hangin around the stage and pickin up

ideas for stories in your paper

  they dont all have the good fortune
to run across a generous property-man
like you bill said i

   pass that replied bill its a swell
idea all right as i was savin when you
started to hand out the salve only dont
let these traveling stage managers get
on or youll get fired out some night
how are they going to get on i
asked im in my shirt-sleeves that
was our agreement you know so that i
would be taken for a grip or a light-
 

man

  fhat was the agreement all right
bill said but i should a stipulated
that your shirt and collar should a
been dirty and your hair combed more j
careless like you look more like a
john with them patent leather kicks
than you do a grip anyway did you
get any ideas for a story to-night 

  not an idea said i but i never
figure that it is all off until i am home
and in bed have you any theme you
could suggest said i eagerly

  no he replied slowly i aint but
you set down there on that box till i
get these flower baskets filled i feel
kind of happv to-night-and now that
the opening is all over i kind o feel
like talkin to somebody did the show
get over

  i understand it is a tremendous hit
said i and the dancer is a sensation 
im glad to hear it murmured bill
as he slowly filled the baskets that the
chorus girls carried on during the bal-
let of roses yes im glad to hear it
 slipped out front i went on aft-
er the first act and some of the critics
were trying to coin some new expres-
sions to properly express the poetry of
her grace and charm theyr are crazy
over her

  you dont say the old property-
man replied

  didnt you see any of her dances r
not a one said bill aint had a
chance to see her at all i been diggin
up props all day theyve got the longest
prop-list with this show that weve had
this season they tell me though that
shes pretty good
the dancer



  yes said i

  well its hard work said he and
when  lores any of the cream cornin to
em after all the years of hard work
why i say let em enjoy it theyve got
it cornin

  is it hard work i asked in sur-
prise it all looks so easy

  this is the easy part he replied as
he stopped filling the basket for a mo-
ment-what you just got through see-
in to-night the big swell audience the
beautiful theatre the critics the grand
orchestra and music and all the beauti-
ful things that go with it but its the
hours and hours and days and days of
standin out there on that bare cold
dark stage-bein turned out

   turned out i questioned

  turned out yes reiterated bill
thats- what they do with girls that
want to be ballet dancers the ballet-
master stands them up and makes them
lift their feet this way he demon-
strated stiffly then this way then this
way another movement then over
again and then again and again-hun-
dreds of times-over and over and over
ive seen em so stiff they couldnt
move then over again hed take em
till ive seen em almost faint away
after a while theyd go over it all again
-then a short rest for lunch and over
again hed take em no one knows who
hasnt been through it or seen it just
what them little women have to go
through

  that must be tough i ventured 
tough exclaimed the old man
tough aint no name for it why ill
never forget a little girl we had here
some years back she was the daughter
of our house carpenter ed young her
mother eds wife-mother we all
called her-she handled all the ward-
robe for the big spectacles that old gil-
derson used to put on you remember
i guess that was before your time
though wasnt it 

  no said i i was a kid then but
i can remember seeing those wonderful
productions

  werent they wonders said bill
proudly dont see anything like em
nowadays well mother was some
ballet dancer in her day but she began

gettin widern she was tall and her toes
gave out tryin to hold up the extra
weight instead of bein a toe dancer she
became a heel dancer-thats where that
gag originated-and so she cut it all out
and took the wardrobe so that she could
be in here in the theatre with ed you
never see such a spoony couple crazy
in love with each other and both of em
all wrapped up in this little kid of theirs
well that little tot-as soon as she
could walk they brought her down to
the theatre

  put her on the stage i asked

  yep said bill proudly broke her
in when she was a babv old man gil-
derson put her in the transformation
scene dressed like a cupid made her
entrance in the heart of a big lily and
say maybe she didnt look cute  he
stopped to view the picture in his minds
eye

  did they keep her on i inter-
rupted

  did they the old man came down
to earth again that settled it for ed
and mother as soon as she was big
enough old marchesi-he was the bal-
let-master with gilderson in those days
-he took hold of her and turned her
out

  very interesting i said

  is it asked bill talk about work
well they never let up on her when
is wasnt marchesi why her mother
was workin with her and ive even seen
old ed young himself tryin to show
her how to point her toes-and he was
stiffern i am he laughed at the recol-
lection of it all i laughed with him

  well they kept on workin on her
until she got good enough to get in the
back row of the ballet marchesi kept
his eye on her and so did her father
and her mother and finally old gilder-
son picked her out and gave her a bit
to dance alone in the ballet of spring
that we had in one of the shows we
were all in love with her and marchesi
picked her for a winner keep your eye
on her he said and some day she will
surprise you 

  what became of her i asked
eagerly

  well said bill to show you how
empty things are in this life and how
the green book album



you never can tell about the way the

lord is shapin things old gilderson
went broke marches has gone where
they dont need any ballet dancing be-
cause everyone there is flym and old
ed young my pal and his wile - her
that we called mother-are restin out
here in a little plot of ground where the
rush and hustle of this life don t trouble
em any more all gone m the only
one of that old crew that still sticks to

the old show-shop

  what became of the little girl t j

asked

  oh yes said the property-man
coining back to the present v hat be-
came of her well after we buned her
father and her mother and the poor lit-
tle thing almost lost her reason and her
health grievin for em i finally got her
to go away with a road show i hated
to see her go out in the world but it
was best for her to have a change

  does she ever come back here   i
asked

  oh yes said bill for several
years she played here every season and
every time she came her and i would
go out the day after the opening night
here and carry along some flowers to
the place where her father and her
mother slept she never forgot

  beautiful said i

  aint it  said the old man but that

was some years ago she aint been here
in some time she went away from this
country and im afraid maybe by now
shes forgot his eyes filled with tears

  oh maybe not i suggested

  well you cant tell lie went on
these girls change when they get
away from home and all the excitement
of this artificial life makes em forget
after she became famous-

  oh then she did succeed  i inter-
rupted

  oh yes he replied-then stopped
i followed his eyes to the doorway

  billy said a low soft voice the
russian dancer stood in the doorway
ill wait for you out here on the stage
i am very tired to-night and when you
are through i wish you would take me
home to the hotel in the morning i
want to go with you out to the-you
know billy

  she moved away from the property-
room out on the dark stage

  she aint forgot said the old prop-
erty-man there was a sob in his voice

  i closed the stage door softly as i
wrent out into the night

hen the gentle irish poet sang
of

      the light that lies
      in womans eyes-

he doubtless had not the slightest
thought or conception of the com-
mercialization of that light what it
would bring had brought in fact when
offered for sale along with other lux-
uries of which men reckon not the
price moore may have thought of the
light in a womans eye that caused
mark antony to forsake a mighty em-
pire the light in the eyes of a helen
beatrice or any of the terrifying
soothing or tempting women of poets
fancies that a glance from a woman
might cause thrones to totter heroes to
perform their most valiant deeds or to
sink impotent in the dust was a com-
monplace when the lesbian sang of
love and beauty on her azure island
knowing full well the diabolical witch-
ery of an eye

  but none of the poets who have sung

rapturously of that light eternal seem
to have realized that standing alone
without the other charms deemed im-
perative for conquest woman with the
sparkling eye has been able to turn
that flash and light into a colossal com-
modity the means of her own elevation
to fame and riches and in many cases
by means of it to achieve immortality
poets do not sing of what things cost
nor of how they sell in the markets of
the world if they did and if they had
the assistance of the tabulator of figures
too large for the human mind to grasp
they might well tune their songs to a
poem on the value of theliftedeye-brow
the curtain that exposes the soul
and the vital dart that beams from
beneath as well as to chant the monot-
onous century-old stanza of its beauty

 what do thine eyes wink at

  the eye of woman is commercial-
ized to-day it has been sold for a long
time in fact but the price was low in




the green book album

the olden day and people paid little at-
tention they knew the effect but
thought nothing of the cause they saw
the flash but thought more of the fact
that the king or prince saw it and was
pleased than to attempt to fathom the
psycholog of seeing and being seen

  over thirty centuries ago the great
law-giver asked what do thine eyes
wink at job xvl and the people
of the world have been repeating his
question ever since particularly in mod-
ern times when the world and his wife
look at the theatre and the people of
the stage for much of their amusement

  several years ago when flo ziegfeld
husband of and manager for anna
held saw the necessity of an additional
song to be interpolated in one of her
productions he sent a hurry call by tele-
phone to gus edwards the song writer
and a scribbler of lyrics to come to
their home immediately for a con-
ference without a moments thought
when the matter was under discussion
and miss held was asked if she had
any idea what sort of song would be
acceptable she gave words to a historic
thought it was old as the proverbial
hills something that everyone who had
observed actresses upon the stage knew
perfectly but no person had previously
given the truth such a terse and ad-
equate expression write something
about my eyes replied miss held
showing rare business acumen that re-
flected the wisdom of the ages some-
thing about the way my eyes act for
you know i just cant make my eyes be-
have

  thats it shouted edwards i
just cant make my eyes behave is a

  this it became and the world knows
the result the american public at least
had been waiting for that admission
from an actress the people responded
to the ditty sang it whistled it and be-
lieved it miss held-she of the co-
quettish and seductive eyes-had al-
ready achieved a popularity in america
and everyone knew that her eyes played
a dominant part in her triumph but to
have her sing a song about them was
just the thing and it came at precisely
the psychological moment having a
deeper significance than miss held or
the composer of her song possibly re-
alized

 eyes of the stars

  with one of the most financially
successful of international stars admit-
ting that her eyes were her fortune it
was natural to turn a thought to some
of the others there was maxine elliott
for instance with her oriental features
and eyes that held all the dreamy beau-
ties of an egyptian night no question
that maxines eyes charmed thousands
of theatre-goers holding them in
admiration and causing them to over-
look many of her dramatic short-com-
ings she knew this power of the eyes i
early in her career she decided to com-
mercialize that light and she has sue- 
ceeded in doing it throughout a pros- j
perous career in the american theatre 

  olga nethersole was slowly pursuing
her way to stardom and was winning j
admirers each season wrhen with par- i
donable vanity she looked into a mirror
and decided that as so many other ac- j
tresses had done before her she would 
capitalize the light that flashed from 
her eyes the critics had looked upon 
her and had written that she had the j
eyes of a spanish beauty this pleased 
her because she had spanish blood in j
her veins and she realized how theatre- i
goers dote upon the exotic particularly j
that which exudes the fragrance of
orange blossoms and the gardens of the j
south at this time she chanced to re- j
read prosper merimees carmen a 
story that had been one of the favorites i
of her life in the authors description
of his heroine she read that carmens
eyes were magnificent and large-the
eyes



  eyes of a young cat watching a bird
the actress read the passage again and
again studied her own eyes carefully
and then seized upon a happy thought
commissioned a writer to prepare for
her use a dramatic version of the novel
and before long she too came to a full
realization of the powr of the eye of
woman and likewise of its commercial
value reutlinger of paris assisted her
in her campaign for publicity by send-
ing photographs of the nethersole eyes
to all corners of the world reproduc-
tions of them appeared in the leading
magazines from vienna to san fran-
cisco and melbourne the world fancies
the eyes that enticed trapped and
ruined the dashing young don jose the
soldier who was fearless in battle and
brave enough to withstand any allure-
ments except the glances from carmen
nethersoles eyes more than any single
physical force carried her to fame and
fortune in the theatre although little
weight may be attached to popular
superstitions however ancient their
origin it is nevertheless interesting to
note that the nethersole eyes are a dark
gray in color and according to the
arabs gray eyes are synonymous with
sin in the koran xx we find on
that day the trumpet shall be sounded
and we will gather the wicked together
even those having gray eyes ibsen
knew this when he said that hedda
gabler had steel gray eyes that express
a cold unruffled repose he described
no other character in his plays in just
this language for none of the others
had the keen calculating desire for sin
that was heddas like carmen she
wanted to test her power over men it
was her chief delight in life

ibsens heroines

 ibsen however fully realizing
what shakespeare termed the wonder
of the mortal eye and likewise having
a full appreciation of the fact that love
hath twenty pairs of eyes was studi-
ously mindful of the eyes of his wom-
en and in an illuminating paragraph of
description usually told not only the
color but gave an additional word con-
cerning character as reflected in the

beacons of the soul for example
asta in little eyolf  had deep earnest
eyes-a photographic index to her per-
sonality maia rubek in when we
dead awaken had lively mocking
eyes yet with an expression of fatigue
mrs elvsted the foil to hedda and dis-
tinct from her in all physical as well as
mental characteristics had light blue
eyes large round and somewhat prom-
inent with a startling inquiring ex-
pression

   julia marlowe has beautiful expres-
sive eyes which she knows well how to
turn to account the roles in which she
has achieved her greatest success have
not called for the seductive fascinations
of a nethersole however and she has
carefully studied and finally evolved a
tender sweetness of ocular expression
that makes her juliet seem to be more
virginal and trusting than the others
her katherine better reward for the
troubles of petruchio and her ophelia
rosalind and viola the most bewitch-
ingly lovely of our generation marlowe
knows the cunning snaps of the eyes
for comedic effect as re jane knows
them and even in the terrific and repel-
lant episodes wherein lady macbeth
drags her husband to ruin the latest
celebrated delineator of the part makes
it plain that the light that lies in lady
macbeths eyes to paraphrase moores
verses has a witching power more in-
fluential in what transpires than her
words or actual participation in the
deeds that mark her ambitious progress

it is marlowes eyes that sweep the
thane from his feet blind his senses
and impel him to horrible deeds


the green book album

  more than any of the stars of the
opera to-day mary garden knows this
secret of the eyes and has utilized her
knowledge in the promotion of her ca-
reer for a considerable time she was
known in this country principally for
her sensuous passionate appeals in
thais and similar roles until she ar-
rived at a climax in salome this
latter interpretation was assisted by the
erratic strauss and his haunting music
which was singularly adapted to the
declamatory sometimes rasping voice
of miss garden as salome however
the scotch lassies eyes shot the fire that
gleams from a tigers face in the jungle
at times they seem to be yellow red
black green-none of which they really
are-and changed with her moods giv-
ing adequate expression to the varying
passions that raged within her little
short of a marvel said the critics that
one who could so correctly convey the
furies in the breast of salome was able
a few nights later to reveal the trusting
simplicity and homely grace of mar-
guerite had they but thought to ob-
serve her eyes and the almost uncanny
intelligence that controlled them-the
knowledge of their power and what
was possible by the shifting of their
kaleidoscopic hues the lids were per-
mitted to fall over the flaming salome
orbs and softly gleamed from beneath
the blue of a wavelcss sea the symbol
of maidenly purity and of all things
sweet and gentle

  the younger actresses are more keen-
v aware of these things than their
elders appear to have been although it

is a matter of record too frequently
overlooked that some of the most fam
ous women of history particularly tht
women of the stage have owed much
of their success to the fact that nature
not only endowed them with beautifu
eyes but also taught them the secrets
of eye-magic which seem to have been
something like the secrets of masonry
among women for no man has ever
yet been able to wholly understand th
language of a womans eyes and yet
all other women seem to comprehend
at a glance

sarah bernhardt

  alone among the great actress
of world history sarah bernhardt ha
no beautiful eyes when she began her
career and was an exception to the
rule feeling her loss keenly because
madam sarah knew what greater
power she might have had over audi-
ences if the luster from her eye hac
been less dim there was a dreamy
languor in her eyes however which she
perhaps recognized before others did
and in photographs on the stage at
home and on the street she accentuated
this detail of facial expression so that
her eyes have played not a small part
in her phenomenal career

  her superb predecessor rachel is
credited by contemporaries with being
able to flash darts of passion from her
eyes that audiences felt keenly and
deeply the still older adrienne le-
couvreur-whose life was a series of
desperate love affairs the greatest of
which perhaps was with maurice of
saxony although voltaire and other
great men admired her and begged for
her favors-adrienne the siren of the
french stage was never called beautiful
in form or face she was plump with-
out being stout but her face was not
pretty and she lacked many of the
prime requisites to success on the stage
in her day but she reigned supreme and
her admirers speak in terms of rapture
of her eyes they speak as much as
her mouth and often supply the place
of her voice wrote one jules janin
said that rachel always appeared to be
small and ugly but when her eyes
brighten he added she treads like a
sovereign

  sarah siddons who held a place in
public esteem that has perhaps not been
equaled by any later artist of the stage
was at first a failure because she was
considered ungainly even awkward
and then there was nothing about her
face except her eyes that appeared to be
beautiful her eye says boaden in
describing her tremendous hold upon
audiences is brilliant and varying like
the diamond-it is singularly well
placed and has every aid from brows
flexible beyond all female parallel con-
tracting to disdain or dilating with the
emotions of sympathy or pity or an-
guish

  noted eyes of georgian days

 margaret woffington the
pretty peggy of romantic drama
who captivated david garrick and wore
his engagement ring although she was
not destined to reach the altar at his
side may have been a beautiful woman
and appears to have been a talented
actress one thing is certain she had
wonderful eyes unless her contempora-
ries were blind to all her faults and saw
only beauty when she was with them
a dazzling creature she appeared to
one writer who adds that her symmet-
rical brow and black eyes full of fire
and tenderness gave her the marvelous
faculty of imparting beauty alike to
love or scorn sneer or smile her eye-
brows he tells us were arched like a
rainbow and jet black making the other
actors on the stage look sleepy by com-
parison

  charlotte corday who never played
at mock heroics but herself became an
assassin and thus in time inspired the
dramatists to re-enact her tragedy upon
the stage of the theatre had accord-
ing to an official passport the fated
great gray eyes that spoke eloquently
of courage to her adherents and re-
called the arab superstition to her
enemies

  anne oldfield a favorite of the
georgian era had large speaking eyes
which she artfully kept half shut just
before flashing out a glance to give ef-

feet to some gay or brilliant utterance
according to her biographer reading
this one is again reminded of miss
helds topical song and the expression
by her of a feminine characteristic that
seems to have been common knowledge
when anne bracegirdle was the toast
of london it is the fashion to have a
taste or tendre for mrs bracegirdle
wrote colley cibber but he admits that
she was not beautiful she had no
greater claim to beauty than what most
desirable brunettes might pretend to
her eyes however were beautifully
black and sparkling and she had dark
brown eyebrows that were the envy of
all women and helped to win her a
final resting place in westminster ab-
bey

the windows of the thespian soul

 hannah pritchard who is
best remembered because she played
lady macbeth with david garrick was
another actress who had no claim to
physical beauty but she had very ex-
pressive eyes remarks her biographer
in accounting for the chief character-
istics that won her fame

  mary ann yates according to rom-
neys picture was all eyes sir josh-
ua reynolds says that she made
garrick weep when he saw her as
electra in voltaires orestes and it
is certain that she was at one time lon-
dons favorite actress yet her critics
were not at all sparing of her lack of
physical beauty it is recorded that her
voice was weak and that her figure was
so encumbered with corpulence that
thomas sheridan was willing to pay
her salary in advance if she would con-
 

sent to break her contract and leave
his theatre at once yet the writers have
much to say of her eyes and that pos-
terity might see them the artist has
painted great balls of fire in her brow
that seem to convey the message of a
mighty intellect

  i lira oneill the actress who became
the original of thackerays fr othertn-
gay in pendennis much as charles
reade re-constructed a peg woffington
to suit his caprice is said to have had
few physical charms yet says thack-
eray her eyes when she lifted them up
to gaze on you and ere she dropped
their purple deep-fringed lids shone
with tenderness and mystery unfath-
omable love and genius seemed to
took out from them and then to retire
coyly as if ashamed to have been seen
at the lattice

  the pivot of an actress power

 knowledge of the power of the
eyes is about all that survives from the
past upon the stage to-day everything
else has changed-costumes lights
properties entrances exits even the
plays themselves and the manner of
reading lines the grand tragic manner
has been forgotten and sometimes it
seems that the comedic sense has en-
tirely disappeared the tricks by which
rachel and siddons moved audiences to
tears would doubtless cause theatre-
goers to laugh outright we of the pres-
sent who are trained to witness the re-
alities of life upon the stage cannot
tolerate the eloquence of the poetic and

the green book album

its grandiose delivery consequently
there are not a dozen actors on our
stage men and women combined who
know how to give to classical blar
verse the intonation and rhythm t
it suggests and demands despite
few lingering voices raised now and
then to prove to the contrary there 
little demand for poetry on our stage
and the poetic in the life of the pre
does not find verbal expression in -
temporary drama

  from their predecessors however
the young stars of the present have in
herited the secrets of eye-magic as the
rug weavers and perfume makers of
persia are indebted to their grandsfef
for the secrets of their arts

  billie burke elsie jan is marie doro
and many others owe their popularity
of the moment to their flashing eye
perhaps they are not aware that thi
is true and ascribe their success with
audiences to vastly different causes sff
too audiences may fail to recognize th
irresistible charm of the eyes as sue
and if they attempt to analyze feminine
charm at all as revealed to them from
the stage give a preference to the voice
there has never been a blind actres
who achieved success however while
there are dozens of women enrolled on
the tablets of fame among them living
examples such as pavlowa the russian
and genee the dane who rarely spoke
a word from the stage but by action
and the message from an eye told be-
witching stories that were more forci-
bly dramatic than the spoken word of
the actress or the aria of the diva
at home
with francos slarir

tt ada patterson

even though fate should permit
me to see frances starr as a white-
haired benign grandmother though
a procession of portrayals of vital char-
acters should obscure impressions of
her as the awakened coquette juanita
in the rose of the rancho or as the
frail-willed unmoral laura murdock in
 he easiest way one early picture
of her will persist it is the picture of
her slim girlish smiling standing be-
side a small table placed as close as pos-
sible to a bow window

  she let me enjoy the view of the

hudson at one side and of central park
on the other then she said with the
gurgling little note of happy childhood
in her throat

  we always have dinner at half-past
five we sit at this table in the window
here and play we are crossing the ocean
sometimes there is a storm and our
ship lurches about dreadfully and we
get terribly seasick the hudson is so
near and when there is a storm we seem
still closer to it so that it doesnt strain
the imagination to fancy were on the
sea

  have you ever crossed the ocean 

i asked	

  not yet but  shall the answer
was accompanied by a determined little
wag of the head that is characteristic
of her the childish wag of the head
was prophetic a year afterward she
made her first crossing of the atlantic
and a little later i received from her a
bubbling little letter filled with the ex-
uberance of youth and the first glimpse
of europe she had expressed her par-
tisanship of shakespeare by standing at
the gate of anne hathaways cottage
where had lived his elderly and active-
tongued wife and shaking her fist at
the dwelling that had housed the tor-
mentor of her idol

  the new york drawing-room

  but to return to miss starr in her
new york dwelling it was an apart-
ment that aimed at stateliness and
achieved girlishness the little draw-
ing-room with the bow window over-
looking the hudson displayed the
delicate gilded outlines and pale ele-
gant colors of louis quinze furnish-
ings it had a grand piano but because
of the limited space the grand piano
was a baby grand and because the mis-
tress of the room and its adjacent
chambers was so young the quiet ele-
gance of the apartment received here
and there an individual touch whose
sum was girlishness the piano was
draped with a once brilliant hued now
somewhat faded spanish shawl the
fringe of which the girl with the au-
spicious name braided in preoccupied
moments and combed in gayly perverse
ones on the piano lay a guitar the
counterpart of the one which she played
while she sang the careless heart
in the california drama

  on a chair in a dark comer of the
room as though a bit ashamed of it-
self yet remaining there by some un-
questioned authority was something at
which visitors looked curiously then
laughed it was a family of dolls they
were rooseveltian in number-a some-
what battered looking mother and four
children of divers sex and sizes

  people give them to me and i must

keep them you know she pouted yet
i fancied then and am convinced now
that a ruthless chambermaid who tried
to displace the family would have been
most unmistakably rebuked

sister

  another girlish appurtenance one
lovelier than the spanish shawl more
welcome than the doll famfty in the cor-
ner was the chaperon if chance would
give to all girls such a chaperon as
frances starrs sister so gentle is
beautiful mrs gladwell so young and
so generous in affection to the girl stars
friends that she is known not only to
miss starr but to all those friends as
sister

  sister goes to the theatre with miss
starr sits in the dressing-room with
her comes home with her drives with
her walks with her shares with her the
apartment on broadway where the fa-
mous street bends close to the river-is
a tender unfailing shadow she is
even an excuse-as for instance when
miss starr wavered on the brink of an
extravagance it was at a change of
season and gown buying time and
gowns were bewilderingly beautiful
true her wardrobe for the season was
complete she had all the gowns she
needed and to buy more than one needs
she had heard-and in the saying had
concurred in a half-hearted way-is ex-
travagance she intended to be loyal to
that sartorial motto but-

  i had seen a paquin gown in a show
window as i drove down town she
said it was the loveliest new shade
of green and i do love green it was a
dream of loveliness and a nightmare of
expensiveness for two days i thought
about that gown then i did what no
one should do-dallied with tempta-
tion i walked past the window again
there it was in the window still tempt-
ing me i as our property man says
put it up to sister she said if you
want it very much you must have it
but it is a luxury not a necessity i
tried to persuade her to say i needed
the gown but she wouldnt i tried to
forget the green dress but it haunted
me one night sistj- had left my dress-
at home with frances starr

ing room to get something for me and
the vision of the green dress returned
and tormented me i must have it i
said to myself at least well-i will
send after sister if they overtake her
fate wills that i am to have the dress
if not im to do without it sister had
met some one on the stage and stopped
to speak to her the maid overtook her
-and i am to have the dress

  presently into the girlish drawing-
room was injected at my earnest re-
quest the green gown secured by such
subtle juggling with fate there en-
sued the usual feminine hysteria at
sight of a triumphant creation then
the mistress of the drawing-room with
the spanish shawl over the piano and
the rooseveltian family in the corner
gave evidence of possessing what many
women sorely lack-definite standards
of gowning

  i like the dress for one reason be-
cause it has a good back so many
dressmakers and their patrons concen-
trate on the front of the dress and neg-
lect the back i have always thought
that a slim straight graceful back
gives elegance to the figure the dress-
maker can help nature out in this the
back should be every bit as well fitted
as the front better if there is any dif-
ference and just as much thought
should be given to its trimming

the managerial judgment

  a few weeks before david belasco
had said of her she has youth
beauty health talent and a tempera-
ment that will enable her to achieve
great results i never make a mistake
in picking out people for big things i
have found that she has the power of
patience and industry of the whole
soul in the work which is the means
of success

  miss starr seemed so fragile of
physique so young with so keen
an appetite for the juvenile things
of life that one could easily wonder
in this room where the anxious face
of the doll mother stared out of the
corner whether david belasco great
dramatic astronomer as he is had
not made a mistake but five minutes

later with a graver expression on the
delicate face that by its half-transpar-
ency suggests a sevres vase she talked
of such topics and in such a way that
mr belasco s judgment was confirmed

in more serious mood

  miss starr talked of growth and
i recall that she said with great earnest-
ness 

  i think the greatest lesson i have
learned this year is a comprehension
of the word depth i have heard per-
sons talk of a deep feeling and of depth
of emotion but the words were almost
empty to me this year i have learned
what it means for instance in the last
act of the rose of the rancho when
igo out on the roof to talk with mr
kearney the fact that an awful night
of watching and waiting had passed
meant nothing to me a few hours had
passed and it was morning that was
all i realized when i began playing
juanita i never even thought of
whether she had slept or not but now
i know that with death or separation
facing her she lay awake all night
agonizing and that when light began to
break she crept a wretched despair-
ing little woman-no longer a child-
up to the roof to bid a last farewell to
the man she loved i know now that as
she climbed those stairs her feet felt
like lead and her heart like a stone i
think i owe that comprehension to see-
ing julia marlowe play juliet she
didnt declaim the lines she talked
them that day i had a revelation of
the meaning of depth 

  with a fervor that was unchi ldish
she aligned herself with the unconscious
disciples of pope for what interested
her more than anything else in the
world was the study of character

  i try to study character as mr be-
lasco does by talking with people she
said i persuade them to talk to me
and while they talk i watch them and
think about them and try to under-
stand them it is the most fascinating
study in the world it is so interesting
and such a relief from thinking of ones
poor little self

  and i think i learn a great deal
	the green

about human nature by reading the
newspapers our maid threatens to
leave because i litter things up so but
when i ask her what is httered she
points to the clippings i have made
from newspapers  pin them on the
cushions on the walls on the dressing-
table on any object that happens to be
near while i am reading

  and the maid says she hamt got
nothing against miss frances except
that she is jes nachelly careless about
newspaper scraps 

   a student of human nature

  all this week i have been think-
ing of a girl i read about in the police
court news the girl was a chamber-
maid at a hotel she had stolen a stick-
pin the judge asked her why she had
taken it and what do you suppose was
her answer she said there were so
many around i didnt think one would
matter the man from whose room she
had stolen the pin was anxious to have
the girl punished the judge wanted to
discharge her the judge said have
you never done anything for which you
could have been arrested yourself  the
man answered never and the judge
said

   then you are a very remarkable
man the prisoner is discharged 

  we talked of the art of handling
people the arts of adaptability and of
bending wills to our purpose

  i think i have learned something
about handling people from mr belas-
co said miss starr he manages peo-
ple by making an atmosphere of peace
and kindness

  suppose for instance you had to
solve the problem of an obstreperous
wardrobe woman 

  i can hardly imagine such a thing
i am sure she wouldnt be there mr
belasco insists upon an atmosphere of
peace but the truth is we have a most
delightful wardrobe woman she calls
me the c hild from my dressing-
room i can hear her say dont bother
me now i must mend the child s dress

visiting an all-night court

  the young person for whom the
wizard bespoke so great a future had
gone from the theatre the night before
to visit the night court for wroinen
she had watched the wretched review
of degraded womanhood and had heard
the judges warning to a sixteen-year-
old girl hovering on the verge of in-
famy 

  jt will be with you with all the
rest-first sixth avenue then the
bowery then chinatown then potters

field

  she had sat there large-eyed silent
her active brain tabulating its impres-
sions  and when the judge who had be-
gun the session florid-faced and bright
of eye had grown pallid and weary
with gazing at the muddy stream that
swirled about his little island of justice
miss starr watched the last derelict
being led away to a cell then turned to
the probation officer and with eyes fill-
ing and fingers opening her gold meshed
purse asked what can i do every-
one should do something wrhat can
i do

  the purse was emptied for a tem-
porary home for rescued girls and
frances starrs name was placed oppo-
site a generous regular contribution on
the homes subscription list unlike
most impulsive charities this one has
been sustained in denver last winter
she visited the homes opened for the
redemption of erring girls through the
work of judge lindsay and again she
was profoundly moved and largely gen-
erous

  once i found her in a sentimental
mood the large candid gray eyes were
tear-filled ive been attending the ob-
sequies of juanita the rose of the
rancho  she said ive laid her away
with her trunk of spanish finery the
play will be released for stock but to
me juanita is dead i loved her and al-
ways will lovelier

  this new part means a great deal
more it gives me the chance i have
at home with frances starr



wanted to play tragedy i will be deeply
interested in her and will pity her but
i wont love her as i loved poetic little
juanita

studying her latest role

  after ten years on the stage half
of them as a star and with two far
different roles carried to success since
the stellar part of her career began
still midway in her twenties she this
summer began the study of her third
star part one which is different from
either of its predecessors but clean
whereas its immediate predecessor had
been foul with spartan-maid heroism
she turns her back upon the alluring
prospect of another tour of europe

  it seems as though everyone is
going to the coronation but me she
said but i must stay at home and
study

  home was in this instance a bunga-
low in the adirondacks and always
accompanied by sister she got into
the skin of the new character by de-
grees-studying in the shingled bunga-
low itself or on long walks through the
forests or in a long afternoons reflec-
tion beneath the shade of a hoary forest
monarch

  when concentration exacted its toll
in pale cheeks listless manner and
lack-luster eyes sister gentle still but
amazingly firm locked the ragged
part in her own trunk insisted upon
a change of the short skirt and sweater
and alpine hat for one of the girlish
mulls in which frances starr looks her
betwitchi ng best and took her to one
of the mountain hotels for gossip and
laughter that lighten a spirit heavy with
the pressure of work then frances
starr was no longer the young woman
whose slight shoulders bore the burden
of the success of a new play that is
expected to surpass its predecessors
she is a girl who can chatter as fast
as any debutante at the hotel about the
topics that engross debutantes-beaux
dresses dances and the merits of vari-
ous sorts of chocolate creams one of
the mountain hotels arranged for an
amateur theatrical night miss starr by
her professional experience was barred

from participation but she showed her
willingness to aid by posting bills

the debut in albany

  if the young star desires to forget
shop on these excursions away from
the new part she is disappointed for
in the whirl of debutante conversation
some girl grows suddenly thought-
ful miss starr knows the symptoms and
turns smiling to meet her inevitable
fate the eyes of the young lady reveal
jier question before her lips frame it

  miss starr how did you happen to
go on the stage 

  and she answers always telling the
oft-told tale in the same way well
you see i had to do something i didnt
think i had any talent for business the
stage was all that appealed to me i
went to the theatre in albany and asked
to see mr frederic bond who was
directing a stock company there he
was very nice he gave me a little play
called a cup of tea and told me to
come back to him when i knew the
smallest part in it but you may be very
sure girls i learned it he gave me a
chance to play it

  werent you frightened

   yes so scared that i was in a kind
of hysteria when i went on the stage
but the audience let it pass for acting
what was more important was that
mr bond let me remain with the com-
pany i played with it all that season
and what then do go on its so
interesting

  then i had to begin all over as
though i had never played before i
came to new york and looked for an
engagement i had read of charles
frohman and ventured to his office i
got to the door and was so frightened
i ran away the same thing happened
at daniel frohmans door then i
took to haunting the door of the man-
ager of the murray hill theatre where
there was a stock company that played
twice a day mr henry donnelly the
manager looked at me as he went into
his office and waited for me to speak
i couldnt say a word

  why

stage fright my dear youll find


the green book album

out when you go on in school next
thursday do you know that the first
time i was interviewed a man came
from a newjaper to see me and i
couldnt utter a sound i just nodded
to mr belasco and he understood and
gave the interview for me the next
time a woman came to see me and i
got on a little better by the third time
i had actually found my voice

broadway and belasco

  what did the manager do while
you were waiting at the door and
couldnt speak inquired the debutante

  after he had seen me waiting there
for three days explained miss starr
i suppose he was curious he wanted
to know whether i was deaf and dumb
he asked me what i wanted i man-
aged to articulate an engagement he
told me to come back to the theatre that
night at ten oclock i promised but
when ten oclock came i was afraid to
go out alone and went to bed instead
the next morning i was at my post out-
side the door of his office when he
came to his office he said  expected
you last night why didnt you come to
the theatre i told him i was afraid to
go out alone he laughed and said
you ought to move nearer the theatre
he gave me a chance to play many
parts i worked hard it was an excel-
lent school that was the way i got on
the stage when girls ask me how to get
on the stage i say i dont know i dotnt
i only know how i got on

  do you think a girl ought to go 
the stage

   if she has to earn a living and if she
has talent for the stage and if-this is
very important for you my dears-if
your mother is willing

  please tell us how you became a
star

  i had been playing in stock com-
panies m california then i came east
and joined proctors fifth avenue stock
company while i was there mr belas-
co came to the theatre he saw me and
he is good enough to say he always re-
membered me then he saw me again

in a play called gallops at the garrick
theatre at that time he was in search
of a very feminine type of girl to play a
particular role in the first act of gal-
lops i wore a riding habit with a hard
hat a dickey and a mannish tie lie -aid
so i have heard im afraid she wont
do she doesnt look the part but he
waited and i wore in the second act a
soft mull dress and looked different he
sent for me and after several talks in
which we discussed almost everything-
i found out afteyvards that was his
method of taking ones mental measure
-he engaged me for the music mas-
ter while i was playing in that piece
with mr warfield mr belasco sent
for me and the talks on nearly every
subject went on one day mr yvarfield
said to me the governor has some-
thing big in view for you i was wild
with delight when it came it was the
rose of the rancho 

the castle in spain

  most interesting and most perma-
nent of frances starrs homes is that
for which she is making her plans she
lias told me of it with the joy of future
possession shining in her eyes

  i comfort myself with thinking of
it while falling asleep or trying to
fall asleep in one-night stand hotels
or traveling between those stands she
said it will be a country house two or
three hours from new york it will be
low and of old english style ive got
far enough to know that i want the
dining-room to open upon a garden and
i intend that it-the dining-room-shall
have french windows friends have
told me that burglars would come in by
those french windows and steal all my
silver but i say let them come  dont
dwell upon anything so unpleasant
what i do like to think is how i shall
enjoy strolling out of those windows
after breakfast into the garden my
drawing-room shall be nearly all yellow
-a pale shade my own room shall be
in pink and blue with white french
cane furniture there shall be a great
deal of sunshine and air in my house
e h sothern is probably the most eminent of the few surviving actors who are thoroughly
acquainted with theatrical tradition - that curious body of stage usages sanctioned by imme-
morial custom by which the actor of classical roles is governed mr sothern writes most
entertainingly of this legendary lore

when an actor comes forth in a
classic role he finds to his hor-
ror that he is caught between
two raging fires-either of which is
almost certain to destroy him one of
these is called stage tradition and
the other baneful innovation

  if the actor-appearingashamlet
for example-should make use of cer-
tain business that some former ac-
tor had employed he is pretty sure to
be told that he is wanting in origin-
ality and called a conventional bore
while on the other hand should he




the green book album

follow his own inclinations in the
matter he is certain to be informed
that he is a dangerous iconoclast

 the fact is actors go on from cen-
tury to century digging pitfalls for
each other any actor with a spark of
intelligence is certain to find some
original way of enacting a scene to
him slavish imitation is irksome he
considers that it is best to do it his
own way-as he feels it-rather than
follow the plan of some actor who has
gone before when enacting a classic
role his way-at first-is never
considered the best way the right
way even though it may happen to
be the one that ordinary intelligence
would dictate after a while the pub-
lic gets used to his method it be-
comes a tradition then another
actor comes along he feels the char-
acter differently discards the busi-
ness-and is soundly berated so it
goes on from age to age

                            i

  after observing this condition of
affairs for many years max beer-
bohm proposed an admirable and
practicable plan to kill off-once for
all-this tradition bugbear it is his
notion that the classics like the seal-
fisheries should have a closed sea-
son he said hamlet romeo
and macbeth will never live again
unless all managers metropolitan
suburban and provincial enter into
a solemn compact not to revive any of
the classics for a period of thirty
years

  after such a time had passed all
the traditions would be forgotten
and the actor left to his own inven-
tion the performance of a classic
role would then be judged on its
merits and not by plaster-cast tradi-
tion for it is as the same writer
says a lamentable fact that when
a play becomes a classic in drama it
ceases to be a play it becomes a

mere pretext for comparative criti-
cism the play is dead the stage is
crowded with ghosts every head in
the auditorium is a heavy casket of
reminiscences play they never so
wisely the players cannot lay these
circumambient ghosts nor charm
those well packed caskets to empti-
ness 

w

  it may as well be admitted that
the tradition incumbus has never em-
barrassed me-for i have never al-
lowed it to sway me a jot from my de-
sign the method that miss marlowe
and myself have employed seems en-
tirely feasible we have found it to
fit our purpose most admirably when
making a shakespearean revival we
have purposely cast tradition over-
board we have first made a thorough
study of the drama and its characters
-have made our own version elim-
inating this and then that till we
have with an honest devotion for
the author arrived at what we con-
sider a good workable scheme we
have not bothered our heads with
what this actor or that actress did in
certain scenes but have in every
case invented our own business we
are equally responsible for what may
be considered good-or bad-in the
plays as we present them to say as
one writer has that our version of
macbeth was a mosaic made up
from the best traditions culled from
other plays is far from the mark it
is a bald misstatement of fact a
brainless heresy

  there is a certain free-masonry of
the stage which the theatre-going
public knows nothing of certain
inside information known only to ac-
tors the auditor will often discover
that certain speeches which seemed
to him valuable have been elimi-
the thraldom of stage tradition



nated it is more than probable that
from time immemorial the actor has
found that these speeches obstruct the
action that they put a halt to the on-
rush of the scene it was found in the
wisdom of the old actors-the wis-
dom be it said of experience-to cut
them out but because some old actor
cut certain lines or passages has never
colored our judgment for we have
in each case followed our own dic-
tates in the matter we have never
been lured into accepting stage busi-
ness simply because some one else
did it yet i can state with absolute
truth and honesty we have never in
making a revival kept one line in our
prompt book which was not shake-
speare 

  this devotion to the bard has lead
to singular results some seasons ago
we had much ado about nothing
in our repertoire when playing in
washington we were soundly be-
rated for having made an unwise and
senseless cut at the end of the third
act well it happened that what the
writer complained about did not be-
long to the text it was an interpola-
tion of some old actor even though
effective i would not have used it
but as it happened miss marlowe
and myself were thoroughly of the
opinion that shakespeare had com-
pleted the scene in a masterly man-
ner the scene as the bard ended it is
as follows

   beatrice yes as sure as i have
  thought or a soul

   benedick enough i am engaged

  i will challenge him i will kiss your
  hand and so i leave you by this hand
  claudio shall render me a dear account
  as you hear me so think of me go
  comfort your cousin i must say she
  is dead and so farewell

  the old stage version ends the act
as follows

    beatrice yea as sure as i have a
  thought or a soul

   benedick enough i am engaged
  puts on his hat i will challenge him

    beatrice will you

    benedick upon my soul i will ill
  kiss your hand and so leave you by
  this hand claudio shall render me a
  dear account

    beatrice youll be sure to challenge
  him

    benedick by those bright eyes i
  will

    beatrice my dear friend kiss my
  hand again

   benedick as you hear of me so
  think of me go comfort your cousin

  i must say she is dead and so farewell

    beatrice benedick kill him kill
  him-if you can

    benedick as sure as he is alive i
  will

 all the talk of beatrice will
you-youll be sure to challenge
him and benedick kill him kill
him if you can and benedicks as
sure as he is alive i will is the in-
vention of kean kemble or wallack
-and we would have none of it

 when we made our production of
the merchant of venice i was
stood up against the wall and pelted
for violating a beloved tradition or
as it was charged for desecrating
the text it has long been a stage
tradition that the elopement scene
should end with shylock crying out
my daughter oh my ducats oh
my daughter this speech belongs
to salarino and is so allowed him in
our version a like tradition long
held sway in the case of shylock in
former times he was enacted by a
low comedian who appeared with a
red wig macklin was the first actor
to abolish this monstrosity such tra-
ditions as these die hard

  when a critic desires to crush an
actor apearing in a classic role he
plumps this at him he doesnt im-
personate the role at all as burbage
did this is a smasher yet there is
not a line-not the vestige of a tra-
dition-as to how burbage a fellow
actor with shakespeare read a line


the green book album

or impersonated a role but this bur-
bage bugaboo which has been hurled
at my luckless head is not half so
disconcerting as to be compared to a
living actor when i first appeared
as hamlet one of the critics sound-
ly berated me saying finally that
richard mansfields rendition of the
melancholy dane was a much more
satisfying impersonation it did not
matter to this policeman of the
drama that mr mansfield had never
appeared as hamlet but had the
writer stuck to burbage-of whom
nothing is known-he would have
been on safe-and classic-ground

  it is not at all unlikely that very
much of the stage business of the
plays which has become a tradition
came down to us from the days of
shakespeare william d avenant-
the reputed son of shakespeare-and
who knew the bard as a boy was de-
voted to his memory he was a close
associate of thomas betterton the
great actor davenant coached bet-
terton in the roles of hamlet and
henry viii and basing his knowl-
edge of the plays on instructions
which he had derived from taylor
and lowin who gained their knowl-
edge from shakespeare himself tay-
lor and lowin were two important
players in the bards company and it
is naturally to be inferred that they
imparted to davenant shake-
speares own characterizations and
that other actors who followed bet-
terton passed on these traditions
from age to age

  it is hardly possible however that
shakespeare could have countenanced
some of the business which was in
use on the english stage during the
past two hundred years or more one

of the strangest bits of this-in force
up to the time of garrick-was that
an actor appearing in an heroic role
should appear before the audience
with two enormous plumed feathers
it was strangely thought that these
plumes imparted dignity another
strange tradition was that an actor
when presenting such roles should
wear buskins-the inference being
evidently that jhese coverings for
the feet affected the motions of the
heart the occasion for this thought
is difficult at this time to imagine

  hamlet above all plays is the
one which has been most hedged
about with strange traditions gar-
rick for instance used two miniatures
in the scene with the queen in which
hamlet says look upon this picture
and on this the use of these two
miniatures became stumbling blocks
for the actors who followed garrick
henderson his immediate successor
ventured to improve the business of
the scene by throwing away the por-
trait of hamlets uncle whereupon
garricks admirers fell foul of him
they argued that as the great gar-
rick had not done so he should not
have desecrated traditions

  desirous of pleasing his patrons
when he next appeared henderson
retained the miniatures in his hand
and was then ridiculed by the garrick
faction on the ground that if he was
right at first he was necessarily
wrong the second time henderson
was also chastised for not using his
hat as did garrick when seeing the
ghost and was also grilled for omit-
ting to upset a chair in his agitation
-the legs bent inwards so that it top-
pled over at the slightest touch if
garrick upset a chair henderson
should have done so

  garrick himself had violated many
of the traditions but saw fit to ad-
the thraldom of stage tradition



here to the old custom of drawing
his sword when horatio wished to
detain him from following the ghost
but when the latter said i am thy
fathers spirit he made a respectful
bow and put up his weapon

th



  one of the most stubborn tradi-
tions known to hamlet was the
tomfoolery engaged in by the grave-
digger these roles were formerly en-
acted by clowns who absurdly bur-
lesqued the scene for ages the first
grave-digger obtained his greatest
effects by divesting himself of a
half dozen waistcoats when this
waistcoat business was abolished in
 leigh hunt expressed his ap-
proval and seven years later when
compton appeared in the role to
charles keans melancholy dane at
drury lane his refusal to revive this
foolish buffoonery was commended
by alfred bunn

  is is rather surprising to learn that
the business of ridding the grave-dig-
ger of his waistcoat was a reform that
had many opponents one of these
set up the claim that the practice had
been observed since shakespeares
day that it was more than likely
that shakespeare approved of it

  another absurdity of hamlet
which required much courage to kill
off was the cock-crowing which was
introduced in order that the ghost
might have reason for starting like
a guilty thing before a fearful sum-
mons

  macbeth like hamlet is en-
crusted with traditions for centuries
it was a custom for the face of the
first murderer to be chalked white
contrasting with heavy black wig
and whiskers for the purpose of mak-
ing him appear ghastly this tradition
held sway long after garricks day

  as another instance of the perver-
sity of tradition one may cite rich-
ard hi it was only up to a short
time ago that an actor dared appear
in any version except that made by
colley cibber indeed the theatre-
goer had come to imagine that this
cibber version was merely a re-
arrangement of a text this was far
from being the case whole scenes
were introduced by cibber which
came to be recognized as from the
brain of the bard consequently
when actors of later time restored
the original text they were severe-
ly criticised for eliminating cer-
tain passages which were not
shakespeares

  it is strangely the case that the
actor or actress who is condemned in
one age for his portrayal of a shake-
spearean role is looked upon by the
next as having given an ideal imper-
sonation in this particular it may be
said that many consider that which
is old is ever golden and that which
is new is gilt

  i recall a peculiar instance of this
kind years ago adelaide neilson ap-
peared in rochester new york in
her lovely impersonation of viola
years after another actresss ap-
peared in the same city in the same
role this new actress was soundly
berated for her rendition one of the
critics stated that with the memory
of adelaide neilson in mind her im-
personation of the role seemed insig-
nificant-that adelaide neilson
would be considered for all time as
the ideal viola a rival critic turned
to the files of the newspaper in which
this criticism appeared and sought
out what had been said of adelaide
neilson the morning after her ap-
pearance there years before he read
to his horror that the critic had writ-
ten that adelaide neilson the ideal
viola gave so wretched an imper-


the green book album

sonation of viola that he could not
stand it beyond the second act and
was compelled to leave the theatre in

disgust

tt

  every once in a while i am in-
formed that one of the plays of our
repertoire is not a good play the
theatre-goer fights shy of it again
tradition the reason for this belief
is owing almost entirely to the fact
that the drama he had seen was a
botched version and badly acted
this is a tradition that we must over-
come but it is stubborn and does not
easily yield to correction



  excepting hamlet no play has
been held tighter in the clutches of
tradition than romeo and juliet
it was only up to a short time ago
that the grotesque figure of the
apothecary was quite got rid of in
former times he was made up like a
clown in a pantomime then too the
nurse in the play who omits the busi-
ness of the fan would be considered
as woefully lacking in technique

  in my own case i have been much
scolded for impersonating romeo ac-
cording to shakespeare how may
any man believe that romeo who so
resembles hamlet in love is until he
meets juliet the light-hearted crea-
ture we should like to have him his
very first speech denies such a con-
ception is the day so young he
sighs in answer to mercutios
good-morrow cousin ah me
sad hours seem long even to
juliets ball this young man goes
with melancholy speeches of

my mind misgives

  some consequence yet hanging in the
     stars

shall bitterly begin his fearful date

  with this night revel

 how may one conclude from
shakespeares lines that romeo was
a light-hearted veronese blade out
for a revel in the garden of the pal-
ace of the capulets

a short story of the moving-picture stage

it would be fine if we could get
the kiddies but we should need at
least fifty

  griswold editor of scenarios for the
chelten film company looked sharply
at the new director and clyde daunt
flushed he knew that griswold did not
like him and he knew too that his fate
bung in the balance most of griswolds
directors were veterans of the motion
picture studios and griswold was in-
tolerant of this newcomer from the high
priced shows who betrayed such an
ignorance of the little tricks of the
trade

  when youve been around here long
enough-if you stay-you may learn a
few things he condescended out on
the old reddington turnpike is an or-
phan asylum with mighty pretty
grounds a donation to the asylum of
fifty dollars will get you permission to

photograph the kiddies and a box of
candy will fix the children themselves
send your assistant out this afternoon
or fix it over the wire ive twisted the
script to play up the child end you
can have evadne the rest of this week
make the rest of the cast to suit your-
self better make the outside stuff first
while this weather lasts

  he swung around to his desk in sign
of dismissal and daunt went back to
the studio

  interviews with griswold always left
him hot and cold he was new to pic-
ture work and like many others he
found it more difficult than it looked
but he was willing to learn could lie
find a teacher and meanwhile he was
willing to admit his ignorance

  the old men seemed to resent his
presence in the studio and they laughed
at his mistakes without seeking to help


the green book album

liim correct them  tad it not been for
betty mason lie would have fared very
badly indeed she helped him when she
could without seeming to offer sug-
gestions but to offset her advice he
had mrs childress mother of the baby
star of the chelten company and others
of the old timers who were loud in
their contempt for the new man

  chelten unwisely enough had told
the others that he was bringing over a
man who would teach them confirmed
in their old-fashioned ways how a
picture should be put on and daunt
was paying the price of that unfortunate
speech lie had come to his work all
enthusiasm only to find that much of
his effort went for naught it was too
late to get a company for the season
and so he held on hoping for a turn
for the better and fighting his battles
as best he could it was unequal war-
fare but up to now he had at least held
his ground though retreat seemed im-
minent

  but he soon forgot his anger in his
engrossment in the tale of the little
waif taken from an asylum only to
find that it was better to be there than
the adopted child of a careless society
woman who had forgotten her enthu-
siasm almost before the papers were
signed griswold knew a good story
and the more daunt read the script
the better he liked it it was the best
chance he had yet been given and his
only regret was that evadne was to
play the part of the orphaned waif he
felt rather than knew that his story
was to be his last chance and his
shoulders squared and his face grew
grim as he told himself that it would
take more than the much petted child
and her meddlesome mother to spoil
the story

  his assistant quickly arranged witli
the asylum over the telephone for it
was not the first time that the children
had posed for the pictures and early
the next morning they set out in one
of the studio automobiles for the home
of the homeless in addition to evadne
and her mother there were only betty
mason and denton the camera oper-
ator they were the only ones needed
for the scenes at the asylum the rest

of the cast being employed in the studic i

scenes

  evadne was oertlv pretty with the j
prettiness of the typical stage child y
she had been badly spoiled by all the r
players and the little twelve-year-old i
felt her importance it was the first j
time she had worked for daunt but he i
had seen her in the studio under the f
other directors and he had frowned at a
her artificial airs and graces and the i
affected imitation of the mannerisms
of the other and older players it seemed j
a pity to spoil the clever story with an g
unreal little heroine but even chelten 
himself thought her wonderful and
daunt had not dared ask for another
child he recalled the pitying looks
some of the others had favored himt
with and wondered if it meant trouble

  the arrival at the orphanage broke
his chain of thought and he looked 
down with a friendly smile at the rows
of chubby children drawn up in prim i
files upon the lawn

  youve a splendid lot of young-
sters daunt told the matron as his
sharp eyes glanced up and down the
double line of gingham uniformed chil-
dren

  the matron beamed her delight afc
the praise we try to keep them look-
ing well she explained with pride
people like to adopt chubby children
and if i do say it there isnt a place in
the whole country that has more chil-
dren adopted only last week a lady
came from the other end of the state
she said everyone told her that the
reddington children were the best any-
where and she thought so too

  but that little one on the end of the
second line lie asked indicating a
child whose little face was not lighted
with a smile as she languidly watched
denton setting up the heavy tripod and
adjusting the camera box

  even in blue and white gingham she
had an air of distinction and the big
brown eyes were eloquent of longing
it was an attractive little face despite
its sadness and betty mason showed
that she shared daunts interest by de-
voting herself to the child while she
waited the call to rehearse

  they dont like the thin ones the
eyadne and the new director



matron repeated her eye on the child
-she doesnt belong in an asylum
mostly that kind has friends but her
mother died a long time ago and her
father was an artist and didnt leave no
kin i guess shell stay here until she
gets too old because we just cant get
her fat and they like them fat and
healthy	

  daunt shuddered at the thought 
the dainty spnituelle child being fat-
tened for adoption like a porker for
market but he had little time to reflect
on the subject for denton called that
the camera was ready and the children
were marched over to the spot he had
selected

  the first scene was simple enough
the children at play on the lawn all save
the one little girl mrs childress as
the matron escorted betty into the
picmre the lonesome little girl caught
her eye and she decided upon adoption
with the same impulsiveness that she
might have shown in purchasing a pup-
py later scenes showed the child creep-
ing back to the asylum that was a better
home than the palace of the wealthy
faddist

  rapidly daunt explained the action
he wanted and stepped back to watch
the result he was genuinely interested
in the story and when evadne now in
a gingham apron that was an offense
to her finery-loving little soul detached
herself from the others to mince toward
the camera in what would have been a
laughable imitation of gwen olcott the
emotional star of the chelten forces
daunt groaned

  twice he sent her back with a plea
for more naturalness and each time she
became more affected in her manner

  dont act this be it urged daunt
dont you see evadne that youre too
happy youve got no papa or mama
and youre all alone in a strange place
youre so miserable that you cant play
with the others and you wonder away
to be alone with your grief act like a
lonesome little girl and dont come
down stage as though you were plan-
ning to do a song and dance be nat-
ural

  little miss childress drew herself up
to her full height-which was not so

ery great and she eyed the director
with cold disdain she had heard the
studio gossip the covert sneers and half
concealed ridicule

  mr daunt she said in her shrill
tones i have had many more years of
experience in pictures than you have
and i guess i know better than you how
this part should be played

  she glanced toward her beaming
mother and found fresh courage in the
maternal glance her self-satisfied
smirk made betty mason long to shake
her betty liked the new director green
though he was and she did not like the
forward child who lorded it over the
studio daunt could not see her face
but he heard denton chuckle and he
knew that his test had come

  of course you havent been with us
very long and you dont know much
about directing the child continued
but if you would leave us alone in-
stead of being so bossy we might teach
you a few things you dont know

  daunt did not know that she was
reciting a part of a speech she had
heard ben gassman make the day be-
fore but betty did and she half started
forward then paused to see what daunt
would do

  for a moment he hesitated he must
make the picture and he must make it
now if he accepted the impertinence
from the child he would lose the respect
of the studio for word would be passed
when they returned that evadne had
called the director and that he had
stood for it after that he could expect
only insubordination on the other
hand it was useless to expect the child
to do as he wished her and there was
no time to telephone into town for an-
other even if griswold would permit
him to drop evadne from the cast for
an instant he wavered then he caught
bettys glance of sympathy and he
moved over to the camera

  got plenty of film jack he asked
trying to make his voice sound natural

  lots came the comforting answer
you said six hundred but i loaded
three boxes twelve hundred feet all
told these kids waste a lot of film

  daunt nodded and turned to the
child


the green book album

  were going to turn this time he
announced and i want you to act the
part tiie way i tell you and not the way
you think it should le played if you
cant youll not be in the picture at all
ive told you exactly what i want you
to do and i want to see you do it my
way be pathetic and appealing and
dont try to act like the soubrette in a
melodrama

  he spoke to he child but he watched
the mother and he stood for a minute
as evadne moved back to the little
group of children mrs childress with
a toss of her head moved over to her
point of entrance but betty paused a
moment

  it does no good to talk she mur-
mured shake the little beast and per-
haps shell mind

  theres a proverb about enough
rope to hang with he reminded but
his smile was grateful

  with a glance at denton to make
sure that everything was ready he gave
a nod and as the action started denton
began to turn the crank that operated
the camera with a defiant smile evad-
ne tripped down toward the camera
where her mother and betty came upon
her mrs childress shared something of
her daughters spirit of revolt and only
betty played her part to daunt it
seemed hours before the action passed
and the players moved across the lawn
out of the field of the lens

  one hundred and ten feet an-
nounced denton as he glanced at the
indicator want to try it again mr
daunt

  in a moment answered daunt
moving over to where the matron stood

  i want to borrow that wistful little
girl he said we will pay well there
will be a couple of days at the studio
for the inside scenes but miss mason
will take good care of her

  for a moment the matron hesitated
and daunts heart sank but she gave a
nod of assent and daunt went back to
the players

  did i do any better asked evadne
defiantly

 you might have made it a little live-
lier with a cartwheel and a counle of
flip-flaps

   dont see any use trying to please
you she pouted

  there isnt any use conceded
daunt go and sit in the car where you
will be out of the wav your mother
will keep you company

  for a moment mrs childress gazed
defiantly into the steady brown eyes
then her glance fell and with the mental
explanation that she was calling his
bluff she moved toward the car hold-
ing evadnes hand

  daunt called the child to him and
rapidly explained what he wanted she
caught his ideas quickly and almost be-
fore mrs childress realized what was
happening the first scene had been
turned and the camera was being moved
to the point for the next scene then
she broke forth into a tirade in which
threat and prophecy were equally blend-
ed and in which all manner of evil was
promised the apparently unconscious
daunt

  betty mason was only on in the first
scene but she stayed with daunt help-
ing him to manage the child and allay
her nervousness some of the scenes
called for acting ability but daunt was
a good judge of players and he smiled
as the child justified his belief in her
in half the time evadne would have
taken the scenes were made and once
more they were in the car rolling back
to town

  at the studio evadne hurried into
the building to spread her story of her
wrongs but plump mrs childress wad-
dled across the yard to the executive
offices where she knew she could find
chelten or griswold

  id like to tell your side for you
whispered betty as they stood in the
studio doorway and watched the angry
woman across the lawn

  better keep out of it advised
daunt the fight had to come and im
glad it will soon be over with there
comes the boy for me now i guess

  unconsciously betty gripped daunts
arm as though she feared to have him
go but she dropped it a moment later
as the boy passed on to the gate and
daunt followed her inside the great
glass-roofed room

  the call quickly came though while
evadne and the new director

 betty was still in her dressing- room
 washing up and daunt was glad she
 was not there to see him go

   griswold and chelten were in solemn
 conclave but mrs childress had van-
 ished they regarded daunt with cold
 displeasure as he entered and stood
 quietly before them chelten spoke
 first

   i cant have any trouble makers
 about here mr daunt he began
 mrs childress tells me you threw her
 and the baby out of the picture

     couldnt use the child and so the
 mother became valueless they were
 the trouble makers the child was care-
 less and then impertinent i warned her
 but she would not obey and her mother
 encouraged her insubordination

    she explains that you had the wrong
 idea of the part the kid has had a lot
 of experience in pictures daunt she
 played her first part in long clothes
 youve got a lot to learn and she could
 teach it to you shes been around the
 studio so long

    i prefer an older teacher explained
 daunt mrs childress bragged she
 would have me thrown out of the studio
 and i suppose that she can make good
 but when i have charge of a production
 i shall not accept the tuition of a
 twelve-year-old child or her doting
 mother

   the three men turned in surprise as
 betty mason came into the room a
 miniature whirlwind and stood pant-
 ing before chelten

- that childress brat has been brag-
 ging about the studio that youve sent
 for mr daunt to dismiss him is that
 true she demanded

    i have been explaining to mr daunt
 that we cannot have a trouble breeder
 in the company began chelten blandly

   then throw out mrs childress and
 evadne suggested betty theyre at
 the bottom of about all the trouble that
 starts around here evadne was impos-
 sible in the part and her mother just
 stood there and egged her on

   we can manage our concerns with-
 out the assistance of the members of
 the stock company began chelten
 smoothly but betty interrupted

   then why let mrs childress run



things if you let mr daunt out i
may as well get out too for she has it
in for me because i sided with him 
but youre in that clara and her
conquests series protested griswold
in alarm

  and what if i am if mr daunt
can t beat her i know i cant and im
through

  chelten squirmed in his chair and
mentally cursed mrs childress betty
was making a hit in the clara series
and she could not well be spared for
a moment he was at a loss it was
daunt who saved him

  i dont want to become an issue
he suggested though i am very grate-
ful to miss mason for her interest i
acted as i still believe for the best in-
terests of the company if i am in the
wrong i am quite ready to go but jack
has two negatives of one of the scenes
-one with evadne and one with the
little orphan perhaps the contrast will
settle the matter i purposely turned
the scene with evadne in for the sake
of comparison

  chelten clutched at a straw and the
desk telephone

  give me the negative department
he ordered and when connection had
been made he instructed the foreman
to have prints of the negatives ready in
the morning

  come around about ten he sug-
gested as he hung the receiver  its
hook well have the stuff then and let
it speak for itself

  the speech suggested dismissal and
daunt and betty retreated in the hall
daunt turned

  im sorry ive gotten you into
trouble he said gently but i am very
much obliged for your championship

  its just that i love a scrap-and
hate that small child she explained 
pretty confusion as she turned to hide
her crimsoning face from his level
glance daunt raised his hat and hur-
ried down the hall if he replied he
must fell what was in his heart and the
hall was no place for that

  he went out the side door to the
street and they did not see him again
until he came into the projection room
the next morning where chelten and
the green book album

jtu

griswold were watching other bits
mrs childress had returned to the
attack as soon as daunt had gone and
chelten and griswold were barely civil
in their greeting	   

  betty uninvited slipped into the
room behind the boy from the printing
room with the positives and dropped
into a seat beside the projection ma-
chine

  the lights went out as the arc splut-

tem and griswold grimly turned out
the shaded light over the directors
table as a sign that this was a special
run nothing was said as the short
length was run but when the end of
the print snapped through the machine
chelten looked at griswold in the light
reflected from the screen

  looks pretty good he said coldly
i suppose she might have been a little
more quiet but a kid like thats a favor-
ite and whatever she does goes

  that has been the trouble sug-
gested daunt quietly then he settled
back for the second version of the
scene was on the screen

  griswold shifted his position slightly
as the wistful-eyed little girl came
slowly toward the spectator he knew
the story and could feel the appeal of
this isolated scene there was some-
thing winning about the child she
looked the part and she made her
points without an effort because she
was simply playing herself chelten
leaned forward slightly and cleared his

throat but he did not speak until the
scene was gone

  i thought you said you were using
one of the children in the home he
oimmented dryly betty noiselessly
clapped her hands

  i did was daunts simple explana-
tion no more was said billy worked
quickly in response to bettys whis-
pered hurry m and the room was
quiet until the last of the four bits had
been run then griswold turned to the
operator

  billy he ordered and his voice
was husky keep that stuff down here
im going to send mrs childress and
evadne over here for a lesson in act-
ing

  and mr daunt betty asked

  griswold smiled at the new director

  i guess daunts intelligent enough
to know that we dont need more than
a ton of rock to fall on us he said

  we win cried betty in delight as
the door swung to im going to adopt
that kiddie

  i was thinking of that myself if i
could find anyone to care for her

  id love to have her betty pleaded

  would a half do loyal little girl
pleaded daunt

  for a moment betty searched his face
and read his story there

  you neednt mind billy hes a par-
ticular friend of mine she explained
as she put up her hps for the betrothal
kiss

the chorus man is the eternal
mystery of theatrical life

      ask the men who have worked
around the theatres all their lives specif-
ic questions about the chorus man and
the majority of them will be unable to
give any satisfactory answers those
who do give answers will often contra-
dict themselves and each other

  the fact is that the chorus man be-
longs to no special species of the human
race except his own he is a develop-
ment and a composite he is an enigma
he may truly sing were here because
were here because were here

  the chorus man is not only enig-
matic but prevalent the scarcity of
chorus women no matter how many
thousands of girls of all ages shapes
and sizes are registered at the offices in
new york is a perennial story which
blossoms out every autumn when the
big companies are being organized for
the season this story moreover has
an element of truth as the managers
are genuinely anxious to get the best
looking and cleverest girls there are

plenty of chorus women but by no
means enough of the right kind

  but did anybody ever read a story
complaining of the scarcity of chorus
men 

 wherever the chorus man comes
from he is obviously part of an un-
limited supply of course most produc-
tions have two or three chorus girls
for every chorus man but nevertheless
his name is legion and when wanted no
advertising is necessary the least un-
dercurrent of gossip in the theatrical
world suffices to bring him well dressed
and smiling to the stage door of the
theatre where rehearsals are to be con-
ducted

on the stage and off

  there is  need to waste time
describing the chorus man on the
stage as he is seen by thousands and
thousands of musical comedy play-goers
every season put on the regulation
make-up and the only thing that seems
to differ about him is his costume




the green book album

i

whether he happens to be one of a
group of young millionaires clad in
flannels and dancing strange un-million-
aire-like dances with a bevy of genuine
american beauties on the pier at new-
port whether he is posing as one of a
picturesque gang of cuban conspir-
ators or whether he finds himself down
as one of the participants in a court ball
of some mythical kingdom he is really
an the same he may be down on the
program among the bull fighters

yjulgrwemen  american tourists
and half a dozen other things but the
alterations are no deeper than the
clothes he wears the chorus man must
not be a distinct individuality

  on the program of a big musical pro-
duction after the list of principals one
finds first the show girls then the
mediums and then the dancers
broilers or whatever the manager
chooses to call the more energetic but
least imposing section of his feminine
ensemble last of all come the chtyrus
men

  this is as it should be from a prac-
tical point of view the chorus man is
merely an adjunct to the entertainment
lie is necessary because male voices
are required and because the chorus
girl must have something to dance with
and cling to he is there merely to help
display her charms

the uniform type

  speaking in general terms the
chorus man is of a singularly uniform
type off the stage as well as on it the
sylph-like blonde who embraces him
on the stage and in whose arms she is
cradled for a romantic song may pass
him by on the street with a haughty
stare of superior disdain but just as
surely as you can spot the chorus girl
descending from her taxicab you can
identify the chorus man as he stands
on the nearest broadway corner and
smokes the cigaret that never fails

  chorus girls earn varying wages
mere show girls who are known to
draw money to the box office have
been paid as much as  or  a week
in a big summer entertainment of
course this price is far above the aver-
age but is quoted for contrast the
chorus man has no such individual
value his price is uniform it is almost
invariably  per week and when a
production is having a long new york
run he sometimes gets two or three
dollars less on the theory that it costs
him less to live when he can board by
the week and has no traveling expense

  eighteen dollars a week for a full-
grown young man with some voice
with average good looks with a
pleasing personality thats all he is
worth and all he gets

  how then does he manage to dress
so well look so well-fed and have many
outward evidences of prosperity
the chorus ma-n

  the fact is that though the chorus
man is famous for his ability to make
small economies a great many of the
boys are not entirely dependent on
what they earn in the theatre this does
not mean that most of them have any
other occupation for such is not the
case but there is often a mother or a
sister at home who does not forget them
and many a chorus man has some al-
lowance or some friend from whom
he borrows with no sincere expecta-
tion of ever paying up

better than the chorus girl

  as a matter of record there is no
question but what the chorus men
generally speaking come from a better
class of homes than the chorus women
though college graduates in the chorus
are rare they are by no means un-
known most of the chorus men have
some fair education some breeding a
pretty girl may be of the very humblest
tenement origin and yet good material
for the stage manager but the male
animal of the same grade is less adapt-
able he may become a millionaire in
business yet he will still bear the traces
of his birth and the labor of his early
life millionaire he may become but
chorus man scarcely ever

  there are college men in the chorus
and men whose education has never ex-
tended beyond the grammar school but
by far the great majority are from the
lower middle class in other walks of
life these same men would have be-
come clerks or salesmen they are not
of the stuff that enters mechanical pur-
suits or the professions

  there are chorus men from all over
the world-men born in new york san
francisco london and all the large
cities the foreign chorus man though
he may occasionally be found is far less
common than the french chorus girl
but the greater part of the chorus men
come from the small cities or the more
prosperous industrial towns in the en-
vironment of those places the stage has
a glamour which is mingled with the
glamour of a oving life and the big
city which is as yet unknown it is
the small-city boy at the gentss fur-

nishingcounter of the local department
store who reads some new york the-
atrical paper of the professional type
and dreams of the day when he shall be
before the footlights more than
likely he is the star of the apollo dra-
matic association-the name is of no
significance-and the editor of the local
paper speaks of him as our talented
young fellow townsman whose his-
trionic ability might well put to shame
the efforts of many of the most dis-
tinguished metropolitan stars who are
to be seen at our palatial opera house

  the lad with the lovely voice

  more than likely this same small-
city boy sings in the church choir and
everyone tells him that his voice is
simply lovely the only trouble is
that if he is the kind of boy who even-
tually finds his way into a broadway
musical comedy chorus he is more than
willing to believe all that is told him


the green book album

  he comes to new york and he ex-
pects great things he finds that there
is no place for the beginner and he has
not the means to study and wait so he
joins the chorus

  it is true that a large percentage of
the chorus men seem as utterly devoid
of any real ambition as the majority of
chorus -girls this is not-because the am-
bition did not exist in the beginning in

most cases but because it has evap-
orated with the realization of what con-
ditions actually are and with the gen-
eral laxity of the rather indolent life he

leads

  the type of chorus man just de-
scribed is of the better sort of course
there is another type more commonly
from the larger cities these are the
black sheep who have a natural aversion
to any kind of concentrated labor but
who have the good looks and half-tal-
ents of many such neer-do-weels they
drift into the chorus because they have
had trouble with their patient families
because their money is exhausted and
because they think it will be a lark
they are just naturally born loafers
with the show-off instinct this man 
is the one who brings discredit on the 
chorus man in general even though 
he is by no means as large a proportion 
as the outside public has been led to j
imagine

how the chorus man spends his 
             time

  the difficulty which confronts the 
chorus alan if lie really wants to earn g
anything substantial in addition to his j
weekly stipend of  is that he is not j
generally long enough in one city to i
make any regular connection the num- j
ber of productions that have runs of
six months or more even in new york 
city seldom exceeds half a dozen dur- 
ing a season in any other city six weeks 
or two months is ordinarily the maxi- i
rrmm and the exceptions only go to i
prove the rule morever the chance of
obtaining regular employment is less- 
ened by the fact that there are two
matinees a week and that rehearsals
may be called at any hour of the day or
night

  the honest chorus girl who really
wants to work can sometimes make
money by posing for artists or photog-
raphers or by being a model at a fash-
ionable dress-making establishment for
such labor is not necessarily confined
to strict hours but such avenues are
not open to the chorus man

  i personally remember one deter-
mined chorus man who came from a
the chorus man



small city in vermont he stubbornly
refused to go on tour but as he had
some voice and was a big fine appear-
ing fellow he often was able to find
chorus work in new york in addition
to being a chorus man he was a book
agent he addressed envelopes he can-
vassed for all sorts of things and he
never seemed to have an idle moment
i have never seen another like him it
is almost needless to say that he was too
good a business man to stay in the cho-
rus when he once made up his mind that
he was not destined to become a great
actor he is now prosperously engaged
in the life insurance business

  this man was a seven days wonder
from vermont he would have made a
practical success of selling papers or
carpet-tacks or kitchen ranges or any-
thing else on earth he was born that
way and just got into the chorus by
mistake

  the manner in which the three or
four or five more energetic and less
supercilious chorus men to be met with
in any large company make a little ex-
tra money is either by being dresser
for the star or one of the other male
principals or by helping load the scen-
ery when the company is on tour i
have known chorus men who did both
of these things and were comparatively
comfortable it is a fortunate thing
for the chorus man that as soon as a
principal gets to earning about  per
week he discovers a sudden inability
to brush and put on his own clothes

how he spends his money

  i have already cited the mystery
of how the chorus man manages to
appear so well-dressed and prosperous
on the  per week he earns and the
indefinite additional sum which he bor-
rows gets from his family at home or
being of the industrious class earns in
some way about the theatre in this con-
nection it is to be remembered that
from his training on the stage the
chorus man will take better care of a
suit of clothes than almost any other
being alive and will do more to make a
 ready-made look like a  tailor-
made than one can readily imagine it

may also be mentioned that as he does
little or no work outside the theatre
his apparel which is part of his stock
in trade has little wear

   when playing a long engagement in
any city the chorus man is generally
to be found from four oclock in the
morning until noon or one oclock in the
afternoon in the hall bed-room of a
theatrical boarding house often a
couple of them live together and get
better accommodations in the after-
noon he is wasting time except on
matinee days in whatever way he can
waste it most agreeably often on the
main theatrical street of the city where
he is playing this is after he has had
his breakfast which has also served
him for lunch and which is frequently
 

taken on the sly at a dairy lunch or
some equally frugal establishment
about six oclock he gets his real meal
of the day sponging it if he canand
going to a table dhote if he can t  hen
comes the evening performance and
after the performance his supper
which is apt to be mainly liquid refresh-
ment at one of the cheaper side-street
bohemian restaurants too common to
require description it is here that he
gets together with others of his kind
and those people who think they have
heard scandal and have never been a
member of such an after-the-theatre
party may be assured that they have yet
to learn the rudiments of genial slander
it is in these places that the chorus
man undertakes to be a theatrical per-
son and spends his money

  theatrical life at  a week

  here again no rules fit all cases
i have known chorus men who were
honestly married to chorus girls and
brought up families the dresser of
one well-known comedian is a chorus
man himself and has a wife who is a
chorus girl neither of them are ever
apt to rise above their present level
but they have two children and seem
to be fairly contented when the chil-
dren can be used in a company they
are taken along with the parents

  it is by no means an impossible thing
for a single man to live with a place to
sleep and enough to eat and warm
clothes to wear on even  per week
i know it from experience but then i
was not a chorus man and did not have
to spend money late at night

  what becomes of the chorus man

  twenty years ago-even fifteen
years ago-the chorus man often grew
old in the chorus he was more of a
fixture like the grand opera chorus
man or chorus woman of to-day he
got into the business because he had
some voice and he stayed because he
had become something of an artist in
his own small way the chorus man
fifty years of age was not a phenom-
enon

the green book album

  to-day thirty-five years seems to be
about the maximum age limit the cry
is for youth and youthful appearance
and youthful activity what then be-
comes of the chorus man

  the best and most comprehensive
answer to this question came from an
old company manager who has grown
gray in the business and has spent much
of his working life in charge of musical
organizations

  they go back to where they came
from he said

  i doubt if any chorus man to-day
spends more than five or at the most
ten years in the chorus if he is ever to
rise above the chorus he has done that
before the first five years are over
and then he is started on a career which
may amount to very little or may even
end in having his name in big letters
on the bill-boards and in electric lights
on the signs of fashionable playhouses
genius like murder will out

  perhaps one chorus man out of four
finally graduates from the chorus and
does sufficiently well to remain per-
manently on the stage of the same
four perhaps one on the average will
end up as a complete wreck and derelict
drifting down into the underworld to
die or hanging around theatres until
he finally can no longer stay in the
chorus and falls hopelessly into the
ranks of the extra people the other
two out of the same four constituted
the mystery which i did not understand
until the old manager said they go
back to where they came from

when he goes back home

  by this the manager did not mean
that the man who dropped out of the
chorus and out of theatrical life alto-
gether all returned to their home towns
though many of them do he meant
rather that they go back into more or
less the same walk of life which they
left to go on the stage

  ex-ghorus-men who may admit
guardedly that they were once on the
stage for a while without specifying
m what capacity are to be found many
of them fairly prosperous in a wide
range of occupations right in new york
the chorus man



city they obtain work in hotels res-
taurants dry-goods stores brokers
offices automobile concerns tailors
shops fashionable dress-making estab-
lishments cosmetic and hair concerns
and in innumerable other fields their
chorus experience is a real asset for if
they are at all intelligent it will have
taught them something of deportment
bearing adaptability and neatness that
they would not otherwise have acquired

  the same boy who left the local de-
partment store and the apollo dramatic
association in the small city often goes
back again and appears in the light of a
far superior creature he has the metro-
politan atmosphere and clings to it for
dear life he is the delight of the girls
in the dramatic society which he rejoins
in a condescending manner and where
be exercises all the prerogatives of star
and stage director he explains that the
stage turned out to be unworthy of up-
lifting that he could not endure the
roving and unsettled life that his fam-
ily could not spare him and that he
discovered it was impossible for any-
body to get ahead without some sort
of pull some of these boys marry
women who would have been complete-
ly out of their sphere if they had never
seen something of the world

climbing out of the chorus

 though the system of selection
may be crude and sometimes preju-
diced it is nevertheless true that the
chorus men who rise to the distinction
of obtaining parts are those best
suited for professional advancement
the first step is that of understudy
to one of the principals even if the
principal is disgustingly healthy the
understudy always gets a chance to
do the role at some rehearsals and
comes under the direct instruction of
the company stage manager not as one
of a crowd but as an individual who
must be ready in case of emergency
even if the understudy never has a
chance to appear in new york patience
and industry will eventually bring op-
portunity in the chance to do a bit
with some company on tour this in
turn leads to a small part with some

secondary company in the smaller
cities and then if the man has ambi-
tion and some real ability he is started
on the road to success especially if it
develops that he has a voice

the chance of success

  theatrical success is strangely
uncertain i know to-day one chorus
man who graduated from a leading
american university some five years
ago he was the idol of the students
owing to what seemed to be his start-
ling ability as a dancer which won him
the post of leading lady for the fra-
ternity performances somehow he has
failed to arrive he has been a picked
dancer in the chorus and an under-
study-but nothing more he is a per-
fectly decent chap of good family too
proud to admit defeat on the other
hand a young fellow who was a chorus
man not six months ago is to-day an
important principal in one big musical
company on tour he has taken the
place of the very principal whom the
first chorus man understudied a year
ago and failed to succeed

  of another class is the son of a well-
to-do new york manufacturer two
years ago he entered the chorus he had
fair education a fine appearance and
some voice he got a bit and became
assistant stage manager of a good com-
pany only to prove himself so untrust-
worthy that he had to be put back in
the ranks the sooner his father gets
this boy into some office the better

  theatrical people are not unkindly or
ungenerous i know of another chorus
man who came from the lowest class
from which i have said chorus men are
seldom drafted he had voice and the
principals of the company furnished
the money for him to have a necessary
operation of the nose and throat he
has a long hard road still before him
for he is awkward and not good to look
upon but the miracle of his success is
some day sure to happen

  to give the chorus man his due he
is not nearly so bad as he is painted
many of them are very decent young
chaps indeed who will eventually go to
work and become respected citizens

blessed indeed and lucky be-
yond compare is the comedian
who has the innate ability to get
laughs and make people forget their
troubles the woods are full of come-
dians some grave some gay some
melancholy comedians are men of
method

one gets his laughs because he is
six feet tall and has the face of an

undertaker one wins approval be-
cause he has a voice with an absurd
tremolo another is successful be-
cause his figure is plump and his face
round still another because he is
funny not because of the lines he
has to speak and the situations he
has to enact but rather in spite of
those aids

  the true comedian to the writers


the luxury of laughter



mind is the man who can read a line
intended to be serious in such a way
that it becomes funny anyone with
intelligence can read a genuinely
funny line and extract a laugh but
not everyone and this includes many
pseudo comedy men can be funny
when they do not have the lines and
situations that bring laughter of
themselves

  william collier undoubtedly is one
of the most clever and finished of
comedians he is a shining example
of a comedian with a method he has
a face that is positively somber he
rarely smiles he is alert mentally
and has a dry matter-of-fact deliv-
ery that is irresistibly funny

  of another type is eddie foy foy
is droll in the extreme he has a
funny expressive face and is a mas-
ter in the art of grotesque make-up

 these two men represent two
schools of modern stage comedy
they are both eminently successful
and yet as different in their styles as
can be imagined

  some comedians depend upon char-
acter types for their forte undoubt-
edly the leading exponent of charac-
ter comedy work in its lighter vein
is lew fields mr fields is a close
student of comedy he weighs the
possibilities of a line or a scene down
to the finest possible point he gets
the utmost out of every syllable he
utters on the stage

  of the same general school is sam
bernard a german dialectician who
gives to his every impersonation a
study and understanding that is re-
flected in the character as he plays it

  these men we have mentioned are
only a drop in the bucket of comedy
one might mention such men as ray-
mond hitchcock frank lawlot g
p huntley jess dandy frank mou-
lan james t powers richard carle
tom lewis frank mcintyre and a
score or more of other leading lights
in the comedy firmament i have at-

tempted to mention only a few who
occur to me each of these men has
a different method all of them have
developed a line of laughter pro-
duction that stamps them not only
as genial entertainers but as men
with intelligence who have developed
their innate comedy ability to a high
degree of perfection and finish

  the writer has been in the busi-
ness of furnishing antidotes for at-
tacks of seriousness for over twenty-
five years nature has gifted me with
a personality that insists upon laugh-
ing my serious and depressed moods
have been few and far between

  during a quarter of a century a co-
median learns a great deal if he is
observant he soon places his mental
finger on the sort of comedy the pub-
lic likes best he discovers for in-
stance that the salacious or indecent
dialogue or scene does not appeal to
any great number of people clean
fun presented intelligently is what
establishes a comedian in a status and
enables him to build up a clientele or
following low or character comedy
of a broad type is the sort of work i
have personally found to be best
suited to my abilities

  a good many years ago i was ap-
pearing in what was then known as
the varieties i had a partner by the
name of mccarthy we were present-
ing an irish act grogans chinese
laundry a rough sketch with more
or less slapstick in it

  the late george knight a famous
comedian of the german school was


the green book album

producing a piece entitled over the
garden wall in the piece there was
the part of an irish woman called
bridget mr knight happened in at
the theatre where my partner and i
were appearing in our sketch i
played two parts one of a man the
other of an irish woman with broad
accent and robust physique mr
knight met me after the performance
and asked me who was the third per-
son in the act i said there were only
two people but he remarked that he
was referring to the woman i told
him i was playing the woman

  mr knight offered me the part
of the irish servant in his play i ac-
cepted as it meant a decided step in
advance for me in a professional way
the playing of this bridget part is
how i came to originate my character
of aunt bridget which has since be-
come more or less well known to
theatre-goers

  aunt bridget was a hit the broad
humor of the part the wholesome
clean if sometimes rough manners
of the celtic dame appealed to audi-
ences my part was made bigger and
bigger until it became of almost
equal importance to that of the star
i remained with mr knight for sev-
eral seasons meantime i became ac-
quainted with a young fellow in the
company john c rice whom you
probably recognize as one of the most
popular of present-day vaudeville ar-
tists rice and i decided that we
would have a play written for our-
selves utilizing and elaborating the

same character of aunt bridget
which had been so successful

  the play was written and it was
called our aunt bridget it was a
success then followed a series of
aunt bridget pieces two of them
were aunt bridgets baby and
our happy little home these
plays lasted for a good many seasons
and firmly established me as a de-
lineator of broadly burlesqued fem-
inine types

  it would seem that i might right- 
fully claim to have been one of the
first successful female impersonators
but unlike the present-day perform-
ers in that line there never was any 
mystery as to whether or not i was
man or woman my voice is not what
you would call soprano it is pitched
in low baritone but the fact that i
played my parts in a spirit of broad -
farce seemingly made them all suc-
cessful

  after the series of bridget com-
edies i appeared in another irish
farce with a woman as the central
character this piece was mrs j
shaughnessy wash lady then
came the widow dooleys dream 
another broad farce with the familiar
irish woman with engaging smile
and generous figure

  after widow dooley i took a fly-
ing tour in vaudeville playing the
aunt bridget character in a mono-
logue then i went back again to
aunt bridget as a revival after a sea-
son or so in which i flitted in and out
of vaudeville i finally appeared for
klaw  erlanger as a headliner in
advanced vaudeville at the new york
theatre i played about thirty weeks
for k  e and then went with a
piece called the top o th world
this was a very successful produc-
tion and continued as a popular at-
traction for a number of seasons
after this venture i was engaged for
a principal part in the mimic
world
the luxury of laughter



  it was at this time that i became
identified for the first time with lew
fields with whom i have remained
ever since after the mimic world
i was engaged by mr fields to play
one of the principal parts in the
jolly bachelors one of those tre-
mendously big musical melanges i
remained with this piece for two
years and this season i became the
possessor of another big part in mr
fields present successful production
the never homes

  but in every production with
which i have been associated wheth-
er under my own or some one elses
management i have always appeared
as a woman-and a nice large fat
good natured woman in the bargain

  therefore in more senses than one
i may truthfully say that i have
played nothing but fat parts in the
parlance of the theatre a fat part is
usually understood to be a good part
one that enables the actor to show
his ability off to the best possible ad-
vantage such fat parts as come un-
der this head are eagerly sought after
by actors in general

  the other variety of fat parts are
those having todo with avoirdupois it
is all a matter of heft and brawn with
me nature has cast me in a mould
which if not exactly heroic is at least
solid and substantial my parts have
never worried me it never has been
necessary for me to fly to the pad and 
the pillow to supply any physical de-
ficiency when offered a fat role

  a young man hailed me as i was
leaving the theatre after a matinee
a few weeks back

  mr monroe i want to thank you
for curing me said he

  curing you young man what
are you talking about

  well i went in to see your show
feeling away down in the dumps and
blue as a bottle of ink ive been out
of a job for so long that i was begin-
ning to think there was nothing left

for me but a dive off some dock but
you gave me the best laugh ive had
in ten years why you looked just
like our old cook and i clean forgot
my troubles watching you im
cured

  and with that he left me wonder-
ing whether i had cured him because
i looked like their cook or because i
had made him laugh

  talking about playing to appreci-
ative audiences calls to my mind an
occasion when i was appearing in
our aunt bridget we were tour-
ing in the middle west and christmas
week usually a very unsatisfactory
and home-sick one for the actor i
was asked if i would be santa claus
for an orphan asylum it was in co-
lumbus i readily agreed i decided
however i would give the kiddies a
new kind of santa claus

  so when the time arrived for me
to appear in the dining-room of the
asylum where about three hundred
poor youngsters were gathered for
their christmas dinner i introduced
myself as mrs santa claus using the
same make-up as i had used in my
piece

  at first the children were some-
what dubious they had never been
informed that old man christmas
had a wife but i told them stories
distributed presents sang to them
danced a little and finally brought in
several of the smaller members of my
company dressed as santa claus s
children never have i seen such de-
lighted youngsters here was a novel-


the green book album

ty for them the rich children and
those other kiddies who spent their
christmas with their fathers and
mothers had only mr santa himself
to help them out while these children
had his wife who had never before
appeared before any little children it
was the most appreciative audience i
have ever faced how those kids did
laugh and applaud and press forward
to shake mrs santas hand i think
that was the fattest part i have ever
played

  i would rather be known as the
man who makes people laugh than
anything else when you walk out on
the stage if you are a comedian your
audience expects to laugh give them
half a chance and they will laugh as
heartily as any comedian could wish
the same audience will sit interested
enough in watching what the other
people in the company do they will
appreciate the beauty of a singers
voice the loveliness of some comely
woman the dexterity of some agile
dancer or the acting ability of some

talented actor and they will enjoy
and applaud all of these but the
comedian has the best of all of them
they will laugh with him and they
will forget their own troubles and
join in with the funny man in finding 
out that life holds something else be-
sides work and worry

  comedians do not grow old they
may add a year to their age every
twelve-month their hair may thinj
out or become gray and deep lines
may appear about their eyes and 
around their mouths even their
knees may become shaky but their
hearts are always young because i
they have led luxurious lives -
they have made people laugh and
added something to the sum total of
human happiness they are the luck- 
iest men in the world-and they
know it

cfxannirg pollock

this month mr pollock discusses kismet the talker a butterfly on the wheel
the return from jerusalem just to get married the bird of paradise over the
river and a number of other plays

last month the theatrical moun-
tain labored as usual bringing
forth one lion and several mice

 the mice were of various sizes
some of them almost succeeded in
looking like lions there was maurice
donnays the return from jerusa-
lem adapted from the french for
madame simone which roared so
hard one was almost convinced and
there were marion fairfaxs interest-

ing comedy the talker and a
pretty good parlor melodrama en-
titled a butterfly on the wheel in
the last zoological analysis however
there was only one lion and his name
was kismet

  a curious thing about the mice was
their recourse to that almost obso-
lete instrument the dramatic tri-
angle very curious i can hear
you say but im obliged to choose






the green book album

between mixing metaphors and put-
ting my rodents into vaudeville
one fancied that the triangle had
pretty well gone out of use its range
is so limited and it has been em-
ployed so constantly sounding its
two or three inharmonious notes in
farce in comedy in drama and in
tragedy husband wife and lover
wife husband and mistress until one
grew certain there were more soul
mates on the stage than in all the
rest of the whole world

  this winter the theatre has been
more than ordinarily prolific of dram-
atized family rows every kind color
and shape of domestic difficulty has
been dragged to and fro behind the
footlights and now in the very be-
ginning of the new year two-thirds
of our productions hark back to the
familiar music and we find the old
three-cornered situation masquerad-
ing as a problem in the return
from jerusalem the grain of
dust a butterfly on the wheel
the talker the stranger and
the right to happiness

kismet

  the exception to the rule has
been the one big success of the
month edward knoblauchs orien-
tal drama kismet in which otis
skinner is appearing at the knicker-
bocker

  mr knoblauch is a young bosto-
nian graduated from harvard who
has entered the local field of things
theatrical by way of london six
years ago lena ashwell who had
produced the piece abroad brought
to america mr knoblauchs first
play the shulamite which in
spite of rather unusual power failed
utterly at the lyric the new the-
atre presented his second work the
cottage in the air a milk-and-
water mixture that came to nothing
and then william faversham acted at

dalys in another disappointing ef-
fort from his pen entitled the 
faun

  mr knoblauchs stock was begin- s
ning to fall when oscar asche best 
known here for his brilliant acting i
with virginia harned in pineros
iris scored an unequivocal hit with i
kismet at the garrick theatre 
london and harrison grey fiske in i
association with klaw  erlanger i
exhibited the drama here with results
already noted

  kismet proves what the gar-
den of allah already had gone a long
way to disprove-that a production
primarily spectacular divided into
numberless scenes may claim and
hold interest as a play hippodromic
in its massiveness its gorgeousness
its variety of background cut up in-
to ten parts with all sorts of things
going on before the curtain between
those parts kismet nevertheless
grips from its first line to its last-a
vivid colorful melodrama in which
the thread of events is not lost for a
single instant

  nor is this sway due wholly to the
physical quality of the drama to the
plenitude of what my friend hassan
ben ali calls polite slaying one
preserves the keenest possible inter-
est in the characters and the philos-
ophy of the story even while ones
senses are ravished by the opulence
and splendor of its environment

  the program describes kismet
as an arabian night it is just
that witnessing the performance is
like reading the volume of arabian
nights illustrated by maxfield par-
rish kismet is oriental not only
in its trappings but in its spirit in
its fatalism its unbridled exercise of
primitive passion its reliance uponco-
incidence and its great wealth of in-
cident many of the phrases used in
the dialogue actually are from sir
richard burton the perfect union of
drama and spectacle recalls the only
notes from the dramatic triangle



two other productions known to me
in which gaud has been an auxiliary
of narrative force-if i were king
and the darling of the gods

  the action of kismet is supposed
to take place in twenty-four hours
during which the plays hero hajj
the beggar murders two gentlemen
and makes the round trip from men-
dicancy to magnificence it was the
editors busy day in fact-that day
which began with dawn before the
mosque of the carpenters in old
baghdad and hajj on the steps cry-
ing out for alms in the name of
allah in the name of allah alms
hajjs ancient enemy jawan who
stole his wife and murdered his child
comes to the mosque a sheik be-
stowing bounty and searching for his
own son who was taken from him by
the last caliph

  hajj ignorant of the mans iden-
tity blesses his foe and receives a
bag of gold thrown at his feet with
shrieks of jeering laughter he dedi-
cates the gold to revenge and be-
queathing his ancestral throne the
stone by the steps of the mosque to
another beggar kasim he goes forth
to square accounts with the despoiler

  the second scene showing the ba-
zaar at baghdad is a wonderful pic-
ture-a graphic moving colorful
grouping quite worthy of a belasco
or a beerbohm tree which contin-
ues to unfold as a picture without a
line of dialogue for five minutes aft-
er the curtain lifts here we meet the
caliph abdallah commander of the
faithful and the wazir mansur fa-
vorite of the old caliph who is fol-
lowed by the striking ebon figure of
his sworder kafur

  here too hajj unable to free him-
self so quickly of habit though plen-
tifully supplied with money steals
gorgeous raiment and with it makes
off to his well beloved daughter
marsinah where he is arrested and
dragged before mansur

  the wazir no longer a favorite at
court has been commanded to appear
before abdallah and render an ac-
counting of public funds that he has
squandered in despair he has lis-
tened to the suggestion of the sinis-
ter sworder that he arrange the as-
sassination of the caliph there is no
one to commit the crime tear not
says kafur fate hath written the
deed in the lines of some mans fore-
head and when the hour comes he
will be at hand

  the hour has come and the city
guards bring in hajj the scimitar
lifted to cut off his right hand for-
feit to justice hajj is reprieved to
murder abdallah to this murder he
consents promised that his daughter
shall become the wife of mansur and
ignorant of the fact that the caliph
climbing the wall into her courtyard
already has won the heart of mar-
sinah

  so we proceed to the diwan or
audience hall of abdallah before
whom the guards bring jawan ac-
cused of ancient crimes the shieks
beneficences speak for him however
and he is sent to prison only until the
account of his charities can be inves-
tigated hajj posing as a juggler
attempts the life of the caliph fails
betrays the instigator of the deed
and is thrust into the very cell occu-
pied by his foe

 there he breaks his chains
strangles jawan exchanges apparel
with him and leaving the dead body
lying in his place is freed by the
edict of the caliph liberating the ab-
solved sheik returning home he
learns that mansur has sent for mar-
sinah to wreak his vengeance upon
her gains access to the harem of
the wazir stabs him in the back and
holds his head beneath the waters of
a bathing pool while the bubbles
breaking on the surface indicate the
last gasps of the dying villain

  abdallah arrives an instant after
	the green

the murder and learning that hajj
is the father of the woman he loves
sentences him to nothing worse than
exile from baghdad the play ends
as it began before the mosque of the
carpenters where marsinah arrayed
in the finery put on her by order of
mansur when he designed her to be
his bride of a night is carried past in
the wedding procession of the caliph
hajj who on the morrow is to be-
gin a pilgrimage to mecca demands
his stone of kasim

  thou didst give it to me at dawn
protests the beggar and at night i
take it away replies hajj that is
fate kasim drags himself of while
hajj strutting majestically to the
throne from which he has been absent
but a day proclaims to the caliph
i may be dirt but to dirt i am the
caliph in an instant he is sleeping
peacefully and while his snores rend
the silence of the tropic night the
curtain slowly falls

  this story which picturesque and
swiftly moving as it is might be
more or less commonplace in any
other setting appeals powerfully to
the imagination in the opulent en-
vironment of the medieval orient
the play is never dull-not even be-
tween acts when there is jugglery
and dancing before the curtain and
when a man and woman render a song
cycle that in a way symbolizes the
meaning of the drama truth to tell
these two lovers are not overly melo-
dious the lady who goes to the
theatre with me prayed they might
be married without delay so that
there might be no more chanting in-
deed all the incidental music lacks
distinction one wishes it might have
been composed by william furst
whose accompaniment was so strik-
ing an advantage to the darling of
the gods

  mr skinner is essentially a roman-
tic actor-in fact he is almost the
last of the romantic actors put him

book album

in trousers and his art sufferb a total
eclipse as hajj the most pictur-
esque figure he has been called upon
to realize since his production of
the harvester he is at his best
giving the full value of his sonorous
voice and of his skillful reading

  mr asche may have done more
with hajjs moments of ferocity but
the insincerity and the suavity of
the beggar are peerlessly shown by
mr skinner after the star the most
vividly impressive person in kis-
met is george relph who came
from england to play the sworder
no one who sees the piece will for-
get kafur his appearance is so elo- 
quent that one regrets his having 
lines to speak

  fred eric as the caliph and ham-
ilton revelle as the wazir are the
weakest spots in an excellent com-
pany special praise being due sheri-
dan block for his jawan rita jolivet
for her marsinah and georgia wood-
thorpc for her performance of a
nurse

  kismet is the biggest two dol-
lars worth in new york

the talker

  marion fairfax who wrote
the talker current at the harris
theatre and maurice donnay who
wrote the return from jerusalem
are agreed that a womans last step
before looking for an affinity is to
figure up how many meals she has
eaten with her husband miss fair-
faxs heroine kate lenox made the
total  breakfasts henriette de
chouze had counted  luncheons
and neither of them seemed to be
pleased about it

  if a man had written the talker
he must have stood convicted of ur-
gallantry for a more severe arraign-
ment of the modern woman that
self-satisfied failure of our century
has not been spoken from our stage
notes from the dramatic triangle

harry lenox puts his case and the
case of mankind in a nutshell when
returning from his work to soiled
linen an ill-prepared dinner and in-
finite argument regarding the subjec-
tion of the sex he inquires

  how many women would pile out
every morning hustle into town
grind all day and hustle back again
during the rush hours-and all for
the sake of the dismal reception the
grouchy breakfast with mrs wife in
a kimono with one eye shut and fuss-
ing about having to get a meal that
would put an east-side boarding
house on the blink in less than a
week and what little she does do
handed out as a favor-not as some-
thing she wants and loves to do as
her part toward making the home no
wonder so many fellows get sick of it
and want to quit in a year or two
but they cant-the ladys got all the
law on her side he promised to love
and cherish and love and cherish he
must or shell soon know the reason
why she promised a few things too
but that seems to be a very different
matter 

  the talker has an exceedingly
good idea at its bottom-an idea un-
fortunately lost to a great extent in
lengthy conversation and in family
bickerings mrs lenox an affection-
ate and honest woman at heart has
become the disciple of a dozen half-
baked philosophies which she voices
at the slightest provocation these
philosophies do her no real harm be-
cause she is too sensible to act upon
them but they exert a tremendous in-
fluence upon her husbands young
sister ruth who does act upon them
to the extent of eloping with a mar-
ried man

  when he discovers the ruin that
has been brought to his home lenox
turns on his wife and tells her a great
many simple truths afterward there
is estrangement that lasts until ruth
broken and ill drags herself back to



her people to be taken into the arms
of her big brother and to procure for
his wife a share of his forgiveness

  as has been said already this
theme revealing the danger of irre-
sponsible theorizing is capital and
one regrets that marion fairfax who
proved herself through the build-
ers to be one of our most promising
playwrights does not stick to it more
closely the real issue is fogged fre-
quently in lenoxs mistaken notion
that it is his wife who has encour-
aged the married man aforesaid the
piece doesnt move swiftly its prog-
ress is halting and frequently round-
about there is too much dialogue
though it is very good dialogue in-
deed so that i found myself agreeing
with the lady who goes to the
theatre with me when she declared
that the title should have been plural

  photographic in its representation
of every-day middle-class life
searching in its revelation of wide-
spread domestic conditions accurate
in character drawing and wholly
modern in theme and treatment the
play doesnt focus to the point of
complete effectiveness when the big
scene comes it is a very human very
honest scene but sometimes one feels
that it is a long time coming

  tully marshall who did such ex-
cellent work as joe brooks in paid
in full and as the degenerate han-
nock in the city again proves
himself to be one of the most skillful
one of the best actors in this country

  the talker probably is not big
enough to prove a big hit in new

most interesting little play

a butterfly on the
wheel

 at the hour of going to press
the fate of a butterfly on the
wheel produced under direction of
lewis waller at the thirty-ninth
street still hung in the balance op-
posed to the success of the play is
the fact that its story clings even
more closely than usual to the lines
of the triangle on the other hand
the piece is simple direct and
throughout its first three acts ex-
ceedingly effective melodrama
played exceptionally well moreover
it has a realistic divorce court scene
well stocked with the delectable de-
tails that make divorce courts so al-
luring to thrill-seekers in general
and to women in particular

  the authors of this offering ed-
ward g hemmerde k c and fran-
cis neilson m p have displayed
rather remarkable skill at play-mak-
ing through two acts that never are
uninteresting they build up a struc-
ture of small happenings that be-
comes an impassable indestructible
wall of evidence at the proper mo-
ment the proper moment of course
occurs in the divorce court already
mentioned where as in the thief
an entire act is divided between two
people-in this case the defendant
and the counsel for that ladys hus-
band

  peggy admaston has been indis-
creet even for a butterfly starting

off with three other persons on a trip
to switzerland she arrives unsus-
pecting and uncomplaining at an
hotel in paris alone with a gentle-
man who is not the least inclined to
diffidence an anonymous letter sent
by a lady who is desirous of winning
the butterflys husband for herself
arouses admastons suspicion and
these events lead quite naturally to
the trial already described and not
quite so naturally to the ultimate
forgiveness of the foolish wife

  a butterfly on the wheel never
gets to be much more than a cleverly
constructed play one sees every step
from the rather unconvincing ingen-
uousness of the heroine to her spot-
lighted misery nevertheless as has
been said the piece carries one along
irresistibly without dull moments
and with occasional climbings to
lofty dramatic heights

skill and a good deal of emotional

tion evelyn beerbohm who so far
as i know also is new to america es-
tablishes himself as one of the best

presented originally in london and

the return from jerusa-
lem

 the return from jeru-
salem written and offered in
paris as a contribution to the litera-
ture of the dreyfus case probably is
a convincing argument for or against
something but three hours spent in
the hudson theatre failed to leave
me quite clear as to the nature of
that something eighteen characters
talk at length in polished and high-
sounding phrases about world peace
semitism and other broad topics
without establishing anything or ar-
riving anywhere in the end my only
conviction was that i had been bored
by a discursive drama that had little
or no relation to contemporary life in
america

  stripped of its debates the re-
turn from jerusalem is a conven-
tional treatment of the problem
presented by this same old triangle
michel aubier loves henriette de
chouze they are married but not to
each other michel announces his in-
tention of remaining faithful to his
wife but that lady finding a letter
he has written to henriette declines
to believe in his protestations and
leaves him free to join his inamorata
having done so michel finds himself
unable to forget madame aubier
moreover he and henriette suffer
from considerable incompatibility of
temper said incompatibility being in-
creased not unnaturally by henri-
ettes fondness for salons in which
persons quite unrelated to the play
enter into the tedious discussions al-
ready described finally michel goes
back home

 madame simone whose return to
town is accomplished through the
medium of this play displays little of
the genius that was so manifest in
her performance of the whirl-
wind her chief tour de force is an
exhibition of hysteria in the third act

that is almost purely physical and
that recalls nothing else so much as
the convulsions of the sicilian play-
ers who created a small sensation
some years ago at the broadway
theatre despite occasional attacks
of temperament arnold daly gives a
fine steady sincere performance of
the role of michel selene johnson is
surprisingly good as the deserted
wife

sounds like a meeting of the sunrise

 just to get married

just to get married in which
grace george made a short stop at

edy it proved to be nothing of the
kind on the contrary the play is
most mild and homeopathic rather

which you are urged to use and for-
get it

poses emmeline accepts and the
rest of the evening is devoted to her
troubles with her conscience shortly
after ten oclock emmeline confides
in lankester that she does not love
him and prepares to go alone to
london at ten forty-five she con-
cludes that she does love him and
the original arrangements are carried
out thus after two hours of conver-
sation we arrive just where we were
in the beginning the whole thing is
a sort of dramatic april fool

tunity for the employment of that
archness and drollery that is her chief

 the bird of paradise

  it is most unfortunate that rich-
ard walton tully in his second play
the bird of paradise which after
having been revealed at dalys suc-
ceeded miss george at maxine el-
liotts could not have profited by the
expert revision and production that
served him so well in the rose of
the rancho

  mr tully has invented an inter-
esting and significant story he has
discovered for its environment what
is theatrically a new world he has
contrived two or three excellent situ-
ations and yet his work comes to
nothing because of an unevenness a
sketchiness a lack of compression
that is almost amateurish  the bird
of paradise as it stands is more an
exhibition than a play an excursion
to coney island a dramatized guide
book to the hawaiian islands

  primarily the bird of paradise
is an exposition of the self-evident
fact that a noble love ennobles
while a base passion degrades and de-
bases incidentally it is a document
regarding the enervating effect of life
in the tropics

over the river

  f ziegfeld jr is as much a
broadway institution as are our elec-
tric signs his productions are as
brilliant as hard and as empty as
the bulbs that make up those signs
mr ziegfelds name almost describes
a performance and so it is necessary
to say but little of over the river
a musical comedy that george v
hobart and h a dusouchet fash-
ioned from mr dusouchets the
man from mexico and that with
eddie foy in the cast and music by
john l golden is presented by mr
ziegfeld and charles b dillingham
at the globe

  it would be necessary to say even
less but for the fact that the enter-
tainment is not all ziegfeld its first
and last acts are vaudeville in a spec-
tacular setting with girls and gaiety
uppermost but its second act is al-
most entirely the prison scene from
the man from mexico

  the mixing has not been well ac-
complished so that over the river 
really is two distinct performances
moreover little of value has been
added in the joining mr dusou
chets situations still are funny
and mr ziegfelds girls gowns and
tout ensemble are surpassingly love-
ly but the new lines lack wit the

whole book lacks continuity and the
music is so reminiscent that taking
an especially glaring example when

and most of the company contribute
specialties of an entertaining nature

cluding one act of excellent farce

  wherell we go he asked prompt-

  on one side of the great open space
the criterion restaurant hung its high-
class banners on the outer walls but
we turned away from them instinc-
tively opposite the red coated flun-
keys of the cafe monico were waiting
to usher us to a table softly lightec
with shaded candles but i knew that
wasnt just the thing we were looking
for and we continued to sweep the cir-
cus with inquiring gaze until our
glances fell simultaneously on a per-
pendicular green sign decorated with
shamrocks and extending from the
roof to the ground floor which read
mooneys irish house

  i guess thats about the best in
sight said crimmins briefly and there-
upon we took our lives in our hands
again and crossed the road to mooneys


crimmins at liberty



  when i last saw crimmins before he
as flung into my arms on the tide of
londons traffic he was doing two
shows a day in a chicago vaudeville
theatre for which he drew a hundred
dollars a week and life was going very
well with him he was a comedian-a
monologist singer dancer-everything
that goes to equip the modern vaude-
ville artist to delight a crowded house
was his gift he had served his time as
a sawdust clown in a a three-ring show
and had valiantly won his way upward
to the point wrhere the managers were
glad to set crimmins in incandescent
iights above their portals when he
played their houses but now as he
threaded his way under the noses of
the horses and around the hooting
taxies a few paces ahead of me i ob-
served that he was not the spruce and
well-groomed crimmins of two years
before his clothes had that indefinable
look of having been brushed too often
and too hard as though they knew no
respite from daily use his shoes had
seen long service on flinty pavements
and the hat which he still wore with
the old rakish air over one ear had all
too plainly passed through more than
one drenching rain

  we went through the private bar in-
to the lounge where half a dozen little
tables were set before plush-covered
seats around the wall and crimmins
climbed before he took time to shake
hands with me and look me over behind
the farthest of these

  well old man its a small world
isnt it he began to think of me
bumping into you here where ive got
no business to be and where you ought
to be ashamed to be caught if your
friends got onto you whats keeping
you here-did you miss your steamer

  they have only one sort of whisky
at mooneys-the sort that smells and
tastes of the peat-smoke of irish
hearths and is doubtless very fine for
anyone that ever gets to like it i sus-
pected that crimmins had been in lon-
don long enough to have passed through
the preliminary stages and had taught
himself to stand for it so i instructed
the bar-maid to bring a flagon of the
smoky and set it near him

mirdtyhy rn here  coun-
tered i m liable to turn up almost

anywhere and besides i like it here
i want to know about you i judge from
your overture that you have a grouch
on this charming little city and that you
yearn somewhat for the pleasing vistas
ot limes square if that is the case
what are you doing in london and how
did you happen to get kidnaped and
shanghaied over here

  times square he repeated holy
mackerel brother dont talk about it
or im likely to do a steve brodie out
through that window and land under
one of those crazy motor-busses out
there it seems like ten years since i
saw times square and its only six
months if i ever get back there again
believe me it will take more than a line
of dulcet conversation to pry me loose
from the united states i fell for that
once and ive got it figured out that
once is more than plenty

  thats right i said encouragingly
go on and get it off your chest who
dragged you away from the forty weeks
solid booking you used to ornament and
tossed you into this inhospitable mael-
strom speak up my lad-you have
nothing to fear from me

  well i suppose i might as well be-
gin right back where it started he said
fondling the whisky decanter as though
he suspected the bar-maid might come
back and claim it before he was quite
ready to surrender possession of it
and that was within shouting distance
of that same times square i was work-
ing all around new york last winter-
never had to go more than a trolley ride
from broadway for three or four
months-and then i got in bad with the
big noise all of a sudden the booking
office made up its imitation of a mind
to switch all my dates and ship me out
on the kerosene circuit some place west
of the ohio river for five or six
months after me being promised steady
time in the sirloin-steak belt along the
hudson i bucked and jumped around
for a while and finally i had to he down
and roll to get em off me when the
battle was over i was off the reserva-
tion you understand-ditched in the
middle of the season with a long black
	the green

mark under my name all along the line
why i couldnt get a job as announcer
in a nickel moving picture show-thats
bow bad the big noise has got all the
show people buffaloed

  i have heard something to that
effect i admitted while crimmins was
pouring another one i should think
it would have been wiser for you to-
er-er-

  oh youre one of those hindsight
thinkers too are you said the come-
dian gloomily well i dont need any
advice out of that box ive had mine
ever since the blow-off came-and im
still getting it but that was only lead-
ing up to how i come to be over here
the last month or so that i worked
around in jersey there was a big
englishman named roberts on the bill
with me nearly every week he had a
little company-his wife and two young
fellows he had brought over from here
-and they put on a sketch that was
supposed to be a scream i wouldnt be
surprised if it did go good on this side
from what ive seen of the natives in
their music halls i should think it was
just about dead enough and slow
enough to tickle em-it was like one
of these cricket games that they spend
two or three days playing with time
out for all hands to drink tea every few
hours but roberts had a contract and
he got the coin all right while it lasted
and he was just wise enough to salt it
away about as fast as it came in he
seemed to take a shine to me for some
reason and when i got my bumps from
the amalgamated association of big
blacklisters he bobbed up with a happy
little thought

   i tell you what you ought to do
old chap he says to me one night when
i was buying him a chop and a mug of
musty ale why dont you have a try
at the other side

   what do you mean-canada i
asked him not for mine i did three
months there once with williams 
brandsbys nickel plate shows and it
took me two weeks to remember how
to laugh when i got back to the states
 no no he says i mean the halls
in england look here he says you
ought to do well over there youve got

book album

an original sort of style dont you see
and you can give em something theyre
not used to and thats what the english
managers are looking for 

  crimmins looked at me sadly over the
rim of his glass as lie unleashed this
grand old platitude-so sadly that i
didnt have the heart to laugh

  you dont mean to tell me you fell
for that stuff i said sternly why
that used to be one of your big laughs
-about the managers that were looking
for novelties and kept six husky door-
tenders in their outer offices to keep
out anybody that threatened to bring a
novelty into the building

  he grinned reflectively but the grin
faded away into a sigh

  no it wasnt that altogether he
admitted but i will say that this brit-
ishers chatter listened pretty good es-
pecially when i took a mental flash at
the long list of shpw shops all over the
country that had a yellow flag out at
the door for me i had to eat every now
and then you know and it seemed to
me if this fellow roberts could get by
with the stuff he was ladling out i
ought to be able to win out a meal tick-
et with my dope he put it up to me so
strong every time i saw him for a week
or two that i finally weakened and be-
gan looking up rates to england and
trying to figure out some way of beat-
ing the steamship companies game an-
other thing that made me hark to the
voice of the tempter was that roberts
was coming back here with his company
and he promised to introduce me around
and show me the ropes for getting on
at the music halls it looked like a life-
saving station to me and i finally made
a running jump for it and came over
with roberts and his wife and the two
hopeful chaps that had been amblinb
around all season thinking they were
comedians

  ill say this for roberts-he had no
trouble about making good in getting
me booked of course i didnt expect
to break into london right off the reel
and make all the old favorites jealous
and i grabbed at a chance to get on at
a music hall in manchester that place
was a scream too but nobody knew it
the fellows that sat in the pit were let
crimmins at liberty

 in about half-past six every evening to
 scrap for the seats and they used to
 bring their suppers with em and eat
 all over the place-cheese and sausage
 sandwiches and bottles of beer-and
 when some gent down in front thought
 same other gent had grabbed off the
 seat he wanted it was the pleasing
 custom to bounce an empty beer bottle
  off the knob of the intruder and have
 him removed for patching up in a hos-
 pital

  you remember that bum suit of
  clothes i used to wear for my act-an
  old prince albert coat and a pair of
 baggy trousers that i picked fp n a
 second-hand store because they looked
 funny and a spotted vest-i had the
 whole lay-out for years the first night
 i went on at this manchester shack the
 manager came behind and looked me
 over

    i say old man he says i dont
 like to appear to interfere in your per-
 sonal matters but really dont you
 think your clothes are a bit-eh you
 understand dont you 

    what do you mean  i says look-
 ing him right in the eye

    why dont you think theyre just
 a bit worn and shabby for a first-class
 hall like mine he says couldnt you-
 er-borrow a better coat for a night or
 two old chap

   what do you know about that for a
 wise scout to be running a vaudeville
 show i jabbed my hook into his ear
 and led him around behind one of the
 flats where the scene-shifters couldnt
 hear us-i didnt want to show him up
 in front of his help then i said say
 this make-up is part of my act under-
 stand ive worn this suit on the stage
 for the last five years and it nearly al-
 ways gets a hand in the states before i
 open my head but if it isnt the proper
 thing over here why ill pack it away
 and dress up like one of these dukes
 youve got on the matrimonial bargain
 counters

   he looked at me quite a little while
 and i suppose what i said was sort of
 oozing through his block in the mean-
 time then he seemed to brighten up a
 bit as though it was getting to him

    oh i see he says you wear



those eccentric clothes to make vour
turn funnier quite an idea too but
our monologists usually dress very
fashionably-boutonnieres and all that
sort of thing

  well i went on that night-my first
crack at the enemy-and the turn didnt
go very good i got a laugh now and
then but i guess it was one left over
from the show of the week before
where some guy had just figured out
the joke i took a long think after the
show and decided maybe his nobs was
right about the make-up-that they
didn t fall for my stuff because they
thought i was a shabby-genteel trying
to out something over on em so the
next day i beat it to a big store and got
dolled out like one of them pictures in
the sunday newspapers-patent leath-
ers choker collar and everything i
could think of that would make me look
as though i had just stepped out of a
motor car for a minute to entertain em
sure enough i went a little better that
night and after i came off the manager
was right on the job with the glad hand
stuff

   your turn went so much better to-
night didnt it he says and i think
your new costume is ever so much fun-
nier than the other too 

  crimmins paused and thoughtfully
poured himself another drink when it
was gone he drummed idly  the table
a few moments

  oh yes he said finally i was go-
ing to tell you about roberts

  no you were going to tell me how
you happened to get ditched in lon-
don i corrected

  well its the same thing he went
on it all comes back to roberts
whichever way you put it it didn t take
me long to see that i was a horrible
frost in the music halls and i guess the
managers got next sooner than i did
things got worse and worse every night
of my trial week in manchester and
along toward the end of it the crowd
used to come earlier than ever to try
and get the front seats so they could
have little chats with me while i was
trying to make em laugh most of em
advised me to go back to america and
that was the wisest tip i got all the tame
	the green

ive been here when i ducked out of
manchester with my little old five
pound note in my inside pocket  think
that wise guy of a manager must have
sent out a telephone message to all his
pals in the association to look out for
me because it was three weeks before i
got a sign of a job and that was in a
hack street in london where i thought
they would call in the police to get me
out of the building on my feet i es-
caped after one performance and then
roberts intruded himself on the scene
again i had a room in a little out-of-
the-way lodging house where he and
his wife and the other two members of
his troupe lived and of course he knew
all about my troubles so when the
blow-off came and i saw it was no go
for me in the halls he suggested that i
take the place of one of his helpers who
was going to quit and go on in the act
with the company that was an awful
bump for me after working alone all
my life and putting it over every place
i went but the meals were getting
rather far apart by that time and i
joined out with roberts-five pounds
a week and two shows a day i figured
it would take me about two years to
save up steamer fare to new york at
that rate but nobody else was shoving
any money at me and the nights are
too cold here to sleep in the parks

  we went along pretty good after i
got the hang of the language and quit
talking american-its as much of a
trick to talk english dialect as it is
dutch or swede believe me-but i be-
gan to find out a whole lot of things
about brother roberts that i didnt
know when we hooked up living right
in the house with him and the wife i
couldnt help it very well and she let
things slip every little while that wised
me up she was a slight little doll-one
of these regulation thin little english
women you see all around you here i
dont know why they dont get any
more flesh on em but every time i
walked in regent street and saw a mob
of them hanging around the shop win-
dows they looked to me like a lot of
before taking ads for some cod liver
oil dope anyhow to get right down to
it i got next that roberts wasnt just

book album

what you might call a model husband-
used to get loaded to the guards every
so often and come home and jaw his
wife half the night-i even believe he
used to take a punch at her now and
then when he was drunk enough i
never was sure about that or i would
have beaten him to a pulp-she was
careful to keep quiet about the worst of
it but i hadnt been in the troupe more
than two weeks when she let me in on
one of their secrets they had a kid
away at boarding school some place a
daughter about fourteen or fifteen
years old mrs roberts must have been
only about that old herself when she
got married-she looked it to me any-
way we got pretty chummy as time
went on and she told me all about the
girl and how smart she was and how
she was getting along in school and all
that stuff but i wasnt ever to peep to
roberts that i knew anything about
her and you can bet i didnt the more
i saw of him the worse my grouch got
on him in the first place he had
dragged me over here-well maybe he
thought he was doing me a good turn-
let that go

  but he kept on drinking more and
more until a couple of months ago he
began to show up even worse in the act
than he used to be-came on with a
little package once in awhile and got
called by the manager i could see the
finish and anyhow i was salting away
all the coin i could spare getting ready
for the big jump back to broadway
every little while id be able to slip a
sovereign into my inside pocket and
button it up where nobody could get at
it but they piled up pretty slow rob-
erts kept his eye on the friendship be-
tween the little lady and me and finallv
i noticed he was getting sore on me he
would growl at me in the theatre if he
had to speak at all and in the hotel he
didnt have a word to say and he
took it out on her i guess because i
noticed about a month ago that she be-
gan sidestepping when she saw me coin-
ing

  but i wasnt worrying much about
the finish of the roberts troupe except
that i was sorry for the wife of course
because i counted up my little old stack
crimmins at liberty



of gold pieces one night and found they
had piled up to the mark-fourteen of
em i had set myself to cop out when i
found i could get to hoboken for
seventy dollars and i had sixteen shin-
ers in my kick and a weeks salary com-
ing roberts could drink himself to
death then for all i cared-it was me
for the ocean blue and all that stuff
and then came a shift in the program

  crimmins looked at me curiously to
judge whether i was listening with a
sympathetic ear or not

  i suppose you found your way in
some place by tapping a certain number
of times i suggested and put the
stack on a green oilcloth table one at a
time

  no not quite he said slowly but
two weeks ago the big smash came
roberts had been hitting it up pretty
hard for quite a while and finally the
manager of the show shop we were
playing closed the act-told roberts it
was all off and he neednt try to come
back they have a pretty close combina-
tion on this side of the water too and
that meant bad business for roberts 
co i ducked from under the first rattle
out of the box-it wasnt necessary for
me to resign because he told me i was
a hoodoo and had queered the act i
broke three finger-nails getting packed
tip to go home and roberts went out to
finish up loading in the cargo he was
carrying the next morning mrs rob-
erts tapped at my door she looked all
m-as though she hadnt slept all night
but had put in the time crying i ex-
pected something like that-she could

srfiaharj iw ahead with the act
ditched and her husband on a spree-

    she told me the worst was yet to
come	j

           use ryng to tell it the way
bhe told me you understand how a
woman is when shes all broken up but
 managed to make out that roberts
was going to take the daughter out of
school and fix up a new act and put the
kid in it what do you know about that
he had it all framed up and was going
down to this country-place wherever
the school is the next day to get her
out and bring her here to london well
mrs roberts couldnt see that for a
minute-she pulled that old stuff about
rather seeing her dead in her coffin than
on the stage and all that and the big
thing was that she was going to jump
the whole business go down and get
the girl herself and go to america with
her and leave roberts to drink his head
off the only hitch was that she was shy
about sixty dollars of what she needed
to make the big get-away and i was the
only one she could turn to in london-
and all that

  again crimmins paused drumming
on the table while he gazed into the bar-
room with a far-away look

  funny how things turn out isnt
it he went on after a few moments
now if i hadnt salted away that coin
the little woman never could have put it
over in time to keep her kid off the
stage it dont make any difference
about me-ill make it somehow before
long say aint you drinking anything
at all 
vvntei a successful
  play-nazimova

t

by archie bell

just a little more than six years ago
the light of the flaming talent of
alla nazimoff first streaked our the-
atrical sky she came to this country
in the autumn of  with a company
of her own people russians all and
she spoke in a tongue strange to ameri-
can play-goers but her personality was
so striking and propulsive her exotic
beauty so rich and her command of
the expedients of her art apparently
so complete that she aroused the keen-
est interest among practiced play-goers
who accepted her as the most interest-
ing as she was the most unique new-
comer in the theatre of this land

  one year after she arrived in this
country with less than a dozen eng-
lish words at her command alla naz-
imoff then become alla nazimova
made her debut as an english-speaking
actress in henrik ibsens hedda gab-
ler this was in november 
since then she has been almost con-

tinually active in the american theatre
she has displayed astonishing energy
but so much of this energy has been
misdirected that she stands to-day in
a position much less important than she
is entitled to by every claim of native
genius her activities during the four
and a half seasons she has acted in eng-
lish have won her something resembling
fame to be sure but though her name
be recognized from lands end to lands
end the celebrity of it rests only partly
upon a foundation of high artistic
achievement

the play is the thing

 the thing mme nazimova has
most needed to translate her celebrity
into glowing fame is a play it is under-
stood she largely has controlled the ar-
rangement of her repertoire she has
acted in a large number of new plavs
none of them has contained more than


wanted a successful play-nazimova

a streak of interest one does not care
o engage here in a discussion of the
american theatre-goers interest in the
plavs of ibsen they have wonderful
values but mine nazimova has found
what every observing professional play-
goer long ago detected-that the in-
terest in ibsen is a declining interest
and that before another generation of
play-goers comes on the statement so
often proved untrue that shakespeare
spells ruin may be made exactly to fit
the case by substituting the name of
ibsen for that of the bard

  mme nazimovas fancy br drama
runs to the bizarre back of that fancy
there is of course a sort of judgment
her selection of plays has indicated
that she realizes as fully as anyone
that her strikingly foreign appearance
and the numerous imperfections of her
speech prohibit her choice of normal
native american drama in which she
would be called upon to attempt the im-
personation of a normal american type
so her fancy has alighted upon unreal
plays exhibiting peculiar abnormalities
of female character and while she has
treated many of these characters with
a great deal of artistic consideration
few people have cared to see them for
if the commanding character in a play
be unreal the play itself will be no
more real and after all as bad as is
our judgment of things in the theatre
yet the public has a protecting intuition
that warns it away from the drama that
does not draw its life-force from life
itself

  it is to the great credit of mme
nazimova that she is able to realize her
own limitations it is not to her dis-
credit that she is unable to analyze
accurately the american dramatic taste
she is only a little while out of a coun-
try that is vastly different from this
she is only a little while away from a
people who are very unlike the people
for whom she acts it is only natural
therefore that she is unable to deter-
mine whether a play having in it a
character suiting her is otherwise es-
sentially conditioned to interest her
audience one principal need of this
actress would appear to be stage advice
another is wise management the two

must go together she knows probably
better than anyone else what she can
act but that knowledge should be for-
tified with experience in choosing
drama for american audiences lack-
ing that experience nazimova should
lean upon one who has had it


the green book album

   it is not at all likely for instance
that any american actress who might
take up her residence in russia would
be able to determine what she should

act before a russian audience habits
of mind standards of conduct social
political economic religious and artis-
tic interests differ in different couni
tries it may be said with fair certainty
that despite her ill selection of plays
her misjudgment of the temper of
american audiences and her erroneous
evaluation of some of our artistic stand-
ards mme nazimovas career in this
country has equaled in brilliancy that
of any of our actresses who might at-
tempt to do in moscow or odessa what
she has undertaken to do here and
there is every reason for believing that
when she and the right play meet we
shall see acting we shall not soon forget
then too we shall have no further
cause to refer to the imperfections of
speech that cover a multitude of imper-
fections of art for the imperfections
detected heretofore in her acting have
been due in no small degree to the little
russian dynamos desire to appear to be
acting even where her playwrights have
given her nothing to act

  imperfections she shows often
enough restraint she too often casts to i
the winds over-elaboration is one of
her artistic sins-but how often has she
proven she knows how to avoid all
these faults how eloquent are her oc-
casional silences all know who have
seen her no one who lacks control over
temperament who is without an in-
tuitive understanding of character or
does not command the technique of the
art of acting ever could play the closing
acts of a dolls house and little
eyolf as they are played by this rus-
sian tragedienne mme nazimova has
been known to act brilliantly mostly oyi
flashes in plays of no importance al-
though she is remarkably energetic and
industrious she often hinders her suc-
cess through carelessness this care-
lessness would appear to be a matter of
recent growth for it is detected nxst
often in the plays with which she hs
become associated since her acquire-
ment of what passes wrell enough for
english speech this leads one to be-
lieve that though she is a little less in-
dustrious than she was in the early
years of her career she must be a little
less jealous of her artistic reputation
wanted a successful play -nazimova

nazimova in russia

  this actress has spent most of her
life in the theatre she was born in
yalta crimea may   her
father was a chemist and botanist and
had a deep and earnest interest in the
education of his daughter she was
taken to geneva for her early training
and there she became a proficient player
of the violin she returned to yalta
when she was twelve years old and
there made her first public appearance
playing a violin solo at axhristmas en-
tertainment at that time she could not
speak her fathers language russian
but had a fluent command of german
and french she studied her native
tongue for a year and then entered the
conservatoire at odessa to complete
her study of the violin she took the
dramatic course instead acquired some
experience as a super under the great
stanisloftsky at the artistic theatre in
odessa and at the end of three years
won the gold medal at the conser-
vatoire a year later she began her
career in earnest by becoming the man-
aging actress of a company playing in
the north of russia at kostroma
there she acted a long list of parts in
a repertoire that included everything
from tragedy to musical comedy she
returned to the south of russia in 
to act with a resident company at ker-
son she spent the next season at vilna
and then went to st petersburg where
she acted many important roles includ-
ing camille paula tanqueray hedda
gabler trilby magda zaza and many
more in a wide variety of russian
plays

  mine nazimova or nazimoff as
she was then called was not the com-
manding genius of the company of
russian players with whom she first
acted in this country she came merely
as the leading associate of paul n or-
leneff an actor who had enjoyed high
reputation in a country where the art
of acting is held in high esteem she
considered herself orlenefips pupil and
it was an honor to her that she did up-
on all who were capable of responding
to the thrilling appeal of that mans
acting he exercised an unforgettable

 spell he commanded his company like
 a general he flooded his plays with a
 wonderful personality she who acted
 vis-a-vis with him in the important
 scenes of interesting plays seemed not
 only to reflect the power of the master
 of the company but to reveal a splendid
 power of lier own she was strangely
 and wonderfully attractive the less
 knowing section of the small audience
 which greeted the russians gave most
 of its interest to the leading woman
 she was snuggling squirrel-like some-
 times elfin and often a pathetic figure
 and these things conditioning her act-
 ing attracted a special interest for they
 gave a bizarre touch to many things
 she did and coupled with her skill
 they set her apart from her associates

invading america

   the russian visitors had rather a
 bitter time of it in that season of


the green book album

 they came here unknown to all
save a few who had heard of their
experiences in berlin and london
where they had gone from st peters-
burg in  to act eugene tchinkoff s
three-act play of jewish life in russia
the chosen people the play had
been prohibited by the imperial govern-
ment because of its racial aspect and
orleneff felt that that prohibition
would serve to awaken the interest of
russian jews throughout the world
he proposed making the play the chief
feature of the repertoire arranged for
his american tour on this tour mme
nazimova acted as leah the daughter
of the watchmaker in the chosen
people as regina in ibsens ghosts
lena lyadinser the actress in her-
mann bahrs comedy the starthe
tsariua in alexis tolstoys tzar
feodor zasa in paul bertons play
of that name hilda wangel in ibsens
the master builder the landlords
daughter in anton tchekhoffs the
sea gull and the daughter of the
chief of police in gogols the re
visor or the inspector as it gen-
erally is called in this country the
acting of mme nazimova in all these
parts won her the greatest favor she
had great talent but it was evident also
that she had had great instruction
indeed she was orleneffs pupil that
actor is now reported to have returned
to this country he does not speak the
english language but he does speak iu
the universal language of his art and it
would appear that the time is at hand
when mme nazimova would do well
to become again the pupil of her former
master-perhaps not to act with him
but to act as he would have her act

the smoke and the flame

  in the beginning of this article
mme nazimovas talent was designated
as flaming if it has fire in it also it has
smoke for while unwatched it has

taken on luridness she is not to be
blamed for all the manifestations of
luridness in her acting for her amer-
ican plays perhaps without exception
have been lurid almost beyond belief
her acting in the the master build-
er always has remained fine and true
in it she still is under the orleneff in-
fluence but her hedda gabler and her
newer interpretation of nora helmer
in the first act of a dolls house do
not represent the actress at anything
like her best the writer of these para-
graphs never saw mme nazimovas
performance of the passion flower
a play written for her by her leading
man brandon tynan but he knows
how great a burden the actress carried
in assuming owen johnsons the
comet or arthur schnitzlers pallidly
wicked comedy the fairy tale or
algernon boyesens wordy composition
the other mary or roberto brac-
cos thin little comedy called in italian
infidele and in english comtesse
coquette

  in her most recent endeavor to find
a vehicle worthy of her the actress has
taken up a translation of pierre wolffs
french comedy les marionettes
her acting in this play has received un-
stinted praise from the critics-many
of whom however found little to ad-
mire in the play the latest word res-
pecting her is that she considers a re-
vival of arthur wing pineros the
second mrs tanqueray a play she
knew in its russian translation if she
acts it we shall see a new paula indeed
but whether this or any other be her
next play she should be reminded that
excesses are destructive to illusion that
draping one self over the parlor fur-
niture is not the assumption of natural
attitude and that even imperfect speech
may be made to seem nearly perfect
if the speaker guard against fleet utter-
ance mme nazimova knows these
things full well of course she need
only to act as she knows how

as an actress ages the inexorable
fact becomes more poignant and
more poignant that no matter
how vital her art remains how tire-
less her ambition her hour of leader-
ship is galloping to its end by some
inexplicable unfair argument the
public continues to accept a man in
youthful characters until his teeth are
gone and his face is wrinkled into
folds as marked as the dusty draper-

and sacredly untouched about the
proscenium arch of wallacks the-
atre joseph jefferson continued to

actually boyish characters as romeo
assanio and adrian de mauprat
and just the other day charles
wyndham born in  showed
himself once more in his delightful
impersonation of the reckless ardent
david garrick

  but if the player is a woman
henry irving expiring in the sixty-
eighth year of his distinguished life
had not felt a need to modify his
repertoire yet before ellen terry
was quite sixty she laid all her love-
ly heroines of shakespeare to eternal
rest only echoes of them when she
reads snatches from a platform waft
their music back across the realistic
and severe atmosphere of the con-
temporary stage mary anderson re-
tired in her girlhood julia arthur
was under thirty when she brought
her dignified adventures with the
classics to a close and ada rehan
was at the maturity of her art yet
still by no means matronly when she
left the stage forever the careers of
these three actresses still glow in the
memory because the flames were vol-
untarily snuffed out at their bright-
est but helena modjeska continued
in the work she loved so long as to
be treated latterly as an antique
clara morris and kate claxton hung
on tenaciously enough to suffer the
humiliation of finding themselves
welcome only in the minor theatres
and fanny janauschek after even
swallowing her tremendous pride
and dipping into vaudeville spent
her final years in poverty and obliv-
ion

  an actress career might be sym-
bolized as a sad descent from juliet
to the nurse it has been said fre-
quently-and never i should think
denied-that no actress can play
juliet until she is too old to look the
part how possibly could a girl
young enough to appear even a little
over fourteen have had experience
enough to handle such a great role

when a new hamlet is revealed the
best praise to be hoped for and prop-
erly the best is that his performance
will be very fine or even may de-
velop into greatness take a concrete
case e h sothern is generally re-
garded as the foremost hamlet of
america at this time he undertook
the character in the autumn of 
and with each year his performance
has improved steadily toward a more
complete expression of his original
conception perhaps only actors ex-
perienced in shakespeare can fully
comprehend the number of repeti-
tions of one of his bigger characters
that are needed completely to round
out and express them at their fullest
very well then mr sothern had
passed forty when he first played
hamlet and it is reasonable to sup-
pose his reading of the role would not
have been as admirable had he not
already passed through twenty years
of thoughtful study practice and en-
deavor but what if the adventurer
had been a woman cautiously devot-
ing two decades to gathering suffi-
cient training and experience for the
consequential undertaking

  i have lived long enough to see
many actresses make the dark de-
scent from juliet to the nurse
sometimes the way is made less pre-
cipitate by a pause at the semi-youth-
ful lady capulet ellen terry marie
wainwright mrs patrick campbell
minna gale effie ellsler mrs james
brown potter marie burroughs
viola allen victory bateman kath-
ryn kidder jessie millward ana
maud milton are memorable juliets
of fifteen years ago-or less than
twenty-five in any case-who could
not hope should they reappear in the
tragedy of love to be cast for a
younger role than the girlish juliet 
mother-a step beneath the shadows
taken actually and gracefully by
eleanor carey who like miss gale
miss milton miss wainwright and
from juliet to nurse

myself enjoyed performances of the
leading shakespeare heroines with
edwin booth i say enjoyed but
in my case anyway the expression
must be qualified one of the first
characters i played with booth was
ophelia i was a very young girl and
naturally was nervous over so dar-
ing and to me important an under-
taking imagine my agitation when
having screwed my courage to the
sticking place for the mad scene i
became conscious of booths keen
black piercing eyes riveted on me
from the wings nor did he move
from there throughout the scene in-
deed he continued to scrutinize my
work closely and enigmatically in
one role and another until i finally
had to ask him not to

  the first time i ever essayed ophe-
lia was to the hamlet of edwin
booths lifelong friend and subse-
quent manager and co-star lawrence
barrett i recall my determination to
dress the girl after her fathers death
in black why not polonius was not
yet cold in his grave laertes was
subsequently to don the inky cloak
for his sister i thought my black
gown most effective but when i ap-
peared in it mr barrett objected and
indeed ordered me immediately to
discard it for a white dress only the
other day i was speaking of this in-
cident to a friend who thereupon in-
troduced me to a passage i had never
read in ellen terrys delightful
story of my life it was during the
rehearsals of the london lyceum
production of hamlet and speak-
ing of her costumes for ophelia
irving was surprised to learn they
were all ready-and without consult-
ing him or his stage-manager or his
art-director

  finished thats very interest-
ing said sir henry very interest-
ing and what-er-what colors are
they

  miss terry told him that in the first



crrshruld wear pink- with

ophelia at that time everything was
rose-color her father and her broth-
er love her the prince loves her-
and so she wears pink for the nun-
nery scene i have a pale gold amber
dress--the most beautiful color the
material is a church brocade it will
tone down the color of my hair in
the last scene i wear a transparent
black dress

  with characteristic verve miss
terry suggests the sardonic silence
with which irving tactfully greeted
the information indeed she had no
suspicion of his feelings until his
stage-manager said to her the next
day you didnt really mean that
you are going to wear black in the
mad scene

  yes i did she gave back blandly
why not

  why not gasped mr lacy my
god madam there must be only one
black figure in this play-and thats
hamlet

  in so far as i appear unconscious-
ly to have wandered from verona to
the court of denmark i may pause
without impertinence to note that the
inevitable retrogression from ophelia
to queen gertrude really corresponds
to that from juliet to lady capulet
except that gertrude is a much bet-
ter acting part than the wife of
capulet rather than the more
marked retreat from juliet to the
nurse among actresses still prom-
inently employed who have played
both gertrude and ophelia i recall
phoebe davis of way dovvn
east fame minna gale maud mil-
ton carrie baillie maud hoffman
alma kruger marion turner and
lady tree in the last-named in-
stance it is mentionable that herbeit
beerbohm trees wife continued to
act ophelia to his hamlet until their
daughter viola tree-now studying
for grand opera-grew old enough
to embody the mad daughter of po-


the green book album

lonius-when lady tree became
professionally her husband s moth-
er as for miss gales appearance in
both parts-and in each instance with
edwin booth as hamlet-it really
was a matter of advancement she
joined his company for seconds be-
ing cast for gertrude before ophelia
emilia before desdemona and so on
others who have played both parts
prominently in othello are lillah
mccarthy mrs h granville bar-
ker agnes eliot scott ida vernon
and eleanor carey-the latter two
like minna gale with booth

  the other day fred terry who was
prevented at the last moment from
being the mercutio to the juliet of
his debutante daughter said gaily
ive played every character in
romeo and juliet but the nurse-
and i suppose ill come to that
soon

  well ada rehan for example has
played all the femaleroles in twelfth
night of course this is not surpris-
ing when one pauses to consider there
are only three nor are there more in
many of the comedies of shakespeare
so it is not strange to recollect that
constance collier marguerite cellier
and agnes eliot scott appeared as
both the olivia and maria in
twelfth night and that julia mar-
lowe and percy haswell undertook
the latter part before progressing to
viola in the merchant of venice
we observe such portias as ellen
terry and maud milton attaining
that enviable role after an appren-
ticeship as nerissa while effie eus-
ler tita brand and alma murray
moved up to it from jessica- cecilia
loftus and winifred emery may be
mentioned as widely noted actresses
who have acted both lesser characters
with henry irving yet never
reached the portia goal in much
ado about nothing ellen terry
winifred emery and jessie millward
played hero before beatrice just as

such prominent benedicks of to-day
as otis skinner robert loraine
george alexander william haviland
and frank cooper began as claudios
ada rehan and kate terry both
destined to go down in histrionic his-
tory as famous beatrices first acted
in the comedy in the minor role of
ursula of leading rosalinds of to-
day blanche bates henrietta cros-
man mary shaw lillian braithwaite
ada rehan agnes eliot scott and
fay davis have been celias ad-
vancements of that sort remind me
to mention that ada rehan most fa-
mous actress of the title role in the
taming of the shrew and blanche
bates both acted the gentle and af-
frighted bianca first just as john
drew climbed up to the character of
petruchio the tamer from hortensio
and otis skinner and matheson lang
from lucentio

  the first time i played juliet was
in the daytime at st louis in the
days of stationary stock companies
there was none of the maddening
rush from town to town of the pres-
ent feverish age-though you may
believe there was little idleness
among actors who were required to
play four and five roles in a single
week my first six nights on any
stage for instance i appeared in des-
demona lady anne and nerissa in
othello richard iii and the
merchant of venice and as julie de
mortimer in richelieu virginia in
virginius and anne musgrove in
two loves and a life but lest
some of us might rust through such
inactivity members of the st louis
company who were out of the bill of
such and such an evening used to
journey to a neighboring town for an
occasional performance i remember
playing juliet on a visit -i that sort
mounted on a balcony made of shaky
soap-boxes and apostrophizing an
inconstant moon that actually was
a headlight from a locomotive
from juliet to nurse



  almost every juliet of the first
rank the last decade or two has had
one of two actresses for the nurse
both famous as the lovely heroine in
their youth i refer to mrs w g
jones who died in  and to mrs
sol smith who until its temporary
abandonment was the oldest member
of the new theatre company ap-
pearing congenially at the opening
of its last season as dame quick-
ly in the merry wives of wind-
sor mrs jones was a very helpful
nurse to those venturesome young
moderns eleanor robson and maud
adams and was i understand the
favorite juliet of the day at the old
bowery theatre half a century ago
julia marlowe was never so happy in
romeo and juliet as when the ven-
erable mrs smith was with her dur-
ing the many years of that associa-
tion eugenia woodward was usually
the lady capulet not exchanging
that role for the nurse until mrs
smith withdrew in passing it might
be mentioned that alice harrington
who then became the lady capulet
was mr sotherns juliet on more
than one occasion-owing however
only to the fact that miss marlowe
was unwell

  the late mrs thomas barry is an-
other instance of a famous juliet of
long ago who ended as the nurse
she impersonated the garrulous old
woman for the last time when doro-
thy donnelly william bramwell and
thomas l coleman were the juliet
romeo and mercutio but more no-
tably when these characters were as-
sumed by mrs james brown potter
kyrle bellew and her own second
husband william redmund mrs
barry was a sister of the famous mrs
charles calvert who may be said to
hold the same position on the london
stage that mrs g h gilbert occupied
on ours mrs john billington now
eighty-five years old has assumed
the young role and the old and in

america as well as england juliet to
the romeo of charlotte cushman and
the nurse with mary anderson old
records tell us that kate bateman
famous for her leah the forsaken
and an american by birth-though
her long career has been almost whol-
ly on the london stage-acted juliet
at niblos garden in new york in
 during the engagement she fell
ill and ida vernon got her first chance
at the character which she later
played with edwin booth miss bate-
mans latest appearance as the nurse
by the way was coincident with the
debut of her granddaughter leah
bateman-hunter in the chief role

  when such old ladies as mrs bil-
lington and mrs calvert were the
toast of new york as the daughter of
the capulets a rage was rampant for
female romeos probably charlotte
cushmans penchant for masculine
impersonation was considerably re-
sponsible madam ponisi the famous
dowager of wallacks company
jean davenport lander and mrs d
p bowers were juliets in such per-
formances and at least the first and
last lingered on the stage long
enough to become the talkative old
serving woman of the girlish hero-
ine the famous mrs bowers who
was cushmans juliet fifty years ago
assumed the same part subsequently
with mrs f b conway-with
whom at other times mrs lander
was the juliet but hurrying rapidly
up to date perhaps the oddest
romeo and juliet record is that of
tita brand daughter of mane
brema of wagnerian opera fame
miss brand played lady capulet
juliet and the nurse and all before
her twenty-second birthday

o-jtvey
the man and woman of tempera-
ment are always the people who
like good things to eat and almost
all actors with visions of one night
stands and bad hotels before their eyes
take special pride during their vacations
in concocting some delectable dish with
which to regale their friends

  the people of the stage-from the
highest to the lowest-are but children
and they are particularly interested in
the thing they are doing at the moment
-whether it be driving a motor or
feeding the chickens rehearsing for a
new play or cooking a favorite dish in
fact i think that for most of them the
preparation of food has the same fas-
cination as making mud pies has for
chmren

may irwins oysters catalan

 of course everyone knows of
the proficiency of may irwin as a cook

favorite dishes of well-known stage folk 

pcnded upon in nine cases out of ten
to order eggs meyerbere for his break-
fast and he usually tells the chef how
to prepare them he says

  will demings home-made bread

 will deming who is playing
the title role in the fortune hunter
this season prides himself upon his
proficiency as a cook and when he is
with a company for any length of time
in a city he always hires a furnished
apartment and regales his friends with
delicious meals his home-made bread
is the talk of the profession

  two tablespoons of butter one
tablespoon of salt two tablespoonfuls
of sugar one quart of milk scalded and
cooled one-half cake of compressed
yeast these are the materials with
which one starts then put butter
salt and sugar in a bread pan pour over
the luke-warm milk and stir until the
ingredients are dissolved add yeast
which has been dissolved in one-half
cup of warm water stir in flour until
stiff enough to knead and knead thor-
oughly for ten minutes let stand in
warm place until the dough has risen to
double its bulk then knead twenty min-
utes make into loaves let stand until
they double their bulk bake in a mod-

otis skinners strawberry shortcake

  otis skinner whose father was
a minister will tell you that he has

eaten strawberry shortcake made from
wild strawberries which grew in the
back lot beyond the church at their
home in bryn mawr the old-fashioned
shortcake is served as long as the straw-
berries last and cornelia the only
child of mr and mrs skinner seems
to be quite as fond of it as her father

  the simpler the form of the cake the
more delicious will be the result al-
though many prefer a sponge or cup
cake with the berries a fine biscuit
dough is made as follows for five or
six small biscuits use two tablespoon-
fuls of butter and one heaping table-
spoon ful of flour mixed with a tea-
spoonful of baking powder mix slight-
ly adding one cup of milk and a half
teaspoonful of salt stir in flour enough
to make a dough too soft to roll patting
with the hands into six little biscuits
the secret of having this dough right
is to make it quickly with as little
kneading as possible and to bake it
through without letting it brown at all
bake from five to eight minutes in a
very hot oven serve immediately
breaking open never cutting each bis-
cuit after generously buttering pour
mashed sweetened berries upon each
half decorating with whipped cream
and a whole berry in the center all
who have eaten this style of strawberry
shortcake proclaim it the most delec-
table they have ever tried

pauline pfielp

i do not love you avowed the lead-
ing lady sweetly but firmly

    but i love you-will always love
you and ill win your love in return
you may not believe it but i will de-
clared the new leading man in an off-
hand confident manner which brought
the stage manager down upon him at
once

  one moment mr edwards the
voice was neither kind nor unkind just
business-like i am afraid you have not
quite the right conception of darbells
part kindly give us the stage direc-
tions

   darbell should be played through-
out the drama with the utmost sincerity
and earnestness  read the leading
man slowly

  earnestness you see-and sincerity
make the audience realize the mans
passionate love the tumult which fills
his soul at this moment put all the feel-
ing of which you are capable into your
voice-like this and the stage man-
ager who was rather stout and very
bald and had grandchildren dropped
on one knee before the leading woman
and repeated but i love you-will al-
ways love you and ill win your love in

return you may not believe it but i
will-with the force and ardor of an
eighteen year old romeo

  why would you believe it mr
griggs can act whispered the girl
from the dramatic school to the sou-
brette in surprised staccato accents

  the soubrette lifted an elegantly
manicured hand and patted her latest
importation of gold curls to make sure
that they were all there well of
course she remarked in a superior
tone the old man isnt paying a hun-
dred and fifty per to a stage manager
who cant act now well see if the new
leading man has sense enough to catch
on

  the new leading man who looked
like a handsome college boy stood fee-
ing the stage manager with an embar-
rassed grin and awaited further direc-
tions

 do you get my meaning now
edwards

  i think so mr griggs he an-
swered not very confidently

  well then well try again miss
rowley oblige us with the cue for that
speech please

  i do not love tou obliged miss
r

the new leading man

rowley with the calm correctness of a
phonograph

  but i love you-will always love
you and ill win your love in return
you may not believe it but i will
repeated edwards doing his best to
follow the stage managers instructions

  from the left upper entrance where
the soubrette and the girl from the
dramatic school were stationed came
a tiny giggle strangled almost at its
birth the leading man turned his head
in the direction of the sound and a
slow wave of red mounted to cheek and
forehead at the corners of his mouth
a little muscle began to twitch

  long experience with the soubrette
had enabled the manager to locate the
disturbance without even raising his
eyes from the prompt-book please re-
member miss voorhees that this is a
professional rehearsal not an entertain-
ment he said scathingly to the cul-
prit who had stuffed her handkerchief
into her mouth and that any further
interruptions will be fined then he
concentrated his attention again upon
the leading man

  no mr edwards thats not the
idea at all youll bring a laugh from
the audience if youre not careful
youre making the part farce-comedy
im sorry i did not intend to sir
-very humbly

  earnestness remember thats the
key-note take it again now please
your cue is i do not love you 

 the leading man wiped his damp
hands on his pocket-handkerchief and
tried once more but i love you-
will always love you and ill win your
love in return you may not believe it
but i will

  the stage manager smiled coldly
dont you see mr edwards that in-
stead of making love to the lady you
are bullying her

  i-i seem to have some difficulty in
-understanding the character stam-
mered the new leading man he had
given up even the pretense of a smile
and the perspiration was standing in
drops on his forehead

  but why should you have difficulty
in understanding the character mr
edwards it was almost lunch time



and the stage manager felt himself los-
ing patience theres nothing in the
character that should trouble you its
a straight leading mans part you have
been accustomed to playing leading
men i presume	

  yes mr griggs

  where have you played them 

     was three seasons juvenile lead on
the road and two years leading man in
stock in dubuque

  dubuque is in the west isnt it 
  the soubrette giggled again

   yes sir in iowa mr clayborne
the owner of the theatre there was good
enough to recommend me to-

  by a courteous gesture mr griggs
signified that further explanations were
unnecessary ah i understand du-
buque iowa  um  im afraid youll find
that new york has a different standard
for professional work than dubuque
iowa mr edwards but continue
the part ill not interrupt you again
do your best

  although the words were not ac-
companied by a derogatory sigh yet in
some subtle way the stage manager had
conveyed to the entire company not ex-
cepting edwards himself that in his
opinion the new leading mans best
would be very poor indeed and in this
he was not disappointed edwards
played his part with increasing uncer-
tainty and ner ousness while the lead-
ing lady feeling the uselessness of act-
ing up to an opposite who would prob-
ably be discharged to-morroyv grew
even more correct and phonetic in her
replies so the rehearsal dragged wear-
ily along until lunch hour

  edwards didnt care for any lunch
he went over to the right wing and
took a seat between the character wom-
an who was dieting because of her fat
and the low comedian who had been
out of a job all summer and was diet-
ing because he couldnt afford to eat
a shadow had darkened the irish azure
of the leading mans eyes

  i wish he began addressing his
fellow actors with some diffidence that
i could talk with the author of this play
about his conception of the part i wish
he were going to be present at the re-
hearsals


the green book album

  the character woman rolled her
chewing-gum which she affected as be-
ing pleasant to the taste and non-fat-
tening from the right side of her mouth
to the left for gawds sake she
ejaculated slowly turning her bovine
and spectacled eyes upon him did you
ever rehearse in a play where the au-
thor was present 

  no confessed the leading man in
a small voice ive only played second
companies on the road and then two
years in stock in dubuque

  the day before he had considered
this record almost an enviable one now
he blushed to recount it

  the character woman removed her
gum entirely for greater ease in ex-
pression well if youve never done it
the lord forgive you for wanting it
she said young man just you wait
till you see a spindle-legged author come
into that stage door with a dinky roll of
manuscript under his dinky little arm
prepared to boss his own rehearsals
and youll know what playing in hell
with your back broke is remember
that and for gawds sake as long as
the man that wrote this show is in aus-
tralia let him stay in australia till
weve put it on and over dont go to
wishing him back here

  thats right thats why i always
like to play in the legit-because old
shakespeare cant come around to give
us side directions about how its done
agreed the low comedian he was as
thin as the character woman was fat
and wore a picture of his thin wife and
three thin children on a scarf-pin fas-
tened in a red tie

  the shadow in the leading mans
azure eyes became more pronounced
i never had such trouble with a char-
acter before he said i dont under-
stand how its happened heaven
knows im not anything to brag of in
most ways but in dubuque iowa they
did think  was some of an actor

  he laughed boyishly and turned
toward his companions as if expecting
their confirmation of dubuques ver-
dict

  there was a moment of embarrassed
silence

  the low comedian got up and wan-

dered to the back of the stage where
be observed the painting on a scene-
drop with great interest

  the character woman restored the
chewing-gum to her mouth and strug-
gled with a cavernous yawn well of
course theres parts that are suited to
us and theres parts that aint then
impelled to further effort by edwards
chagrined face she put out her fat
pudgy hand disfigured by huge brown
freckles and gave his arm a friendly
pat now dont you be discouraged
dear i shouldnt wonder but what youd
do real well in musical comedyshe
added comfortingly

  the stage manager was fifteen min-
utes late for the afternoon rehearsal a
most unusual occurrence but it was
because he had taken the time to go up
to the old mans private office and
report that the new leading man from
which such great things had been ex-
pected was utterly failing to make
good

  looks well-pleasant voice-splen-
did enunciation but theres something
the matter here the stage manager
tapped his forehead he seems inca-
pable of getting any intellectual under-
standing of the part

  cant ou beat it into him asked
the old man anxiously he had great
respect for the stage managers opinion
or he would not have paid him his
salary

  the stage manager did not seem to
think he could theyve had the parts
to study for two weeks and a reading
of the whole play was given them last
wednesday this is practically the sec-
ond rehearsal you know my theory
if an actor doesnt show something of
what he can do by then hes hopeless
might as well give him his two weeks
salary at once and save time

  i wish now id have run out to du-
buque myself and seen the boy act
grumbled the old man but i was up
to my ears in work so i took clay-
bornes word he was a genius why i
cant believe yet he wont make it
griggs clayborne ought to know he
and i played together in the old legit
for three seasons and hes as good a
judge of acting as i am myself
the new leading man



  but how long has claybome been
running that stock playhouse in iowa 
asked the stage manager as though the
answer might explain everything

  ten years the old man looked
shamefaced youre right griggs
when a man gets away from broad-
way and broadway ideals for that
length of time hes apt to go to the bad
well im sorry but it cant be helped
have the understudy out in front this
afternoon and tell him to watch all the
business closely by the way who is the
understudy 

  harold livingston the stage man-
agers tone was apologetic

  that young whipper-snapper who
tried to play the juvenile in a dying
flame and fell down on it

  yes he promised to look after the
stage on the road and of course we
didnt anticipate that this edwards
wouldnt make good

  the old man wrinkled his forehead
until it looked like a street map of
manhattan while he considered the
knotty problem before him call up
sheridan the agent he decided sud-
denly tell him weve got to have gil-
bert davies here for opening night in
new york davies play failed this sea-
son and hes gone into vaudeville in
the west somewhere but that doesnt
matter well pay his price and mean-
time-oh meantime better keep the
understudy out in front as i said it
will be letting edwards down by de-
grees

  so during the afternoon rehearsal
one of the seats in the front row was
occupied by a solemn-faced young man
with large eyes who held a book of the
play in his hands and made frequent
pencil notes on it during all of edwards
performance and everyone from the
leading lady who didnt care to the
character woman who really did un-
derstood that the fate of the new lead-
ing man from iowa if not already set-
tled adversely was at least trembling
in the balance

  at the close of the rehearsal the lead-
ing mans wife came down to the the-
atre to walk home with him until she
appeared no one had suspected ed-
wards of having a wife and she looked

so very pretty and so very young that
at first glance the doorkeeper took her
for a stage-struck schoolgirl and
started to bestow fatherly advice upon
her but she soon set him right on that
with a dignity which left him gasping
she was mrs edwards her husband
was clyde edwards at present playing
the leading man-the capitals are
mrs edwards own-and she would
wait right here please until her hus-
band came out to meet her

  she took the chair offered by the now
deferential doorkeeper and with keen
eyes appraised the different actors as
they passed she realized that the com-
pany was a first class one because the
leading ladys shoes were as dainty as
her gown and the low comedian tipped
his hat and murmured excuse me as
he passed in front of her-a courtesy
not invariable with low comedians her
heart beat high with pride to think that
her husband had found a place befitting
his talents at last

  well clyde as the stage door
closed behind them she tucked her hand
in his arm regardless of the fact that
they were in new york city and not
dubuque iowa

  not very well clyde was not one
of those rare individuals who spartan
like keep every trouble locked in their
own breasts he belonged to the larger
and more commonplace class who
blurt it out to their wives

  she stole a quick glance at his
troubled face and for an instant her
own became troubled also then she
smiled cheerfully-oh very cheerfully
indeed she always smiled when the
way looked dubious for both actors and
husbands must be kept from worrying

  clyde i just wouldnt care a bit
how rehearsals went the first day a bad
beginning makes a good ending i al-
ways worry when everything goes
smooth right off its so apt to mean the
play is only a candidate for cold stor-
age oh yes it is you know you
laughed at me for saying that when
thev put on dillmans pride and yet
what a failure that old thing was-only
ran two nights	 

  im not worrying about tins play

he said


the green book album

  she tried again you mustnt mind
if the stage manager gets mad and
throws things they often do m new
york mr claybome said so himself
he said some of them considered they
had to to get the actors nerved up to

doing good work

  oh mr griggs isnt like that he
treated me well enough-never raised
his voice edwards stumped along be-
side his wife moodily his free hand
shoved down in his ulster pocket it
wasnt the play or the stage manager
kid it was- the words seemed to
stick in his throat but he drew a long
breath and got them out-just me i
was rotten in the part

  you werent you imagine it why
youve never been rotten in a part in
your life she cried with girlish de-
fiant loyalty

  his face refused to brighten you
know i said in the beginning that i
wasnt certain i understood the char-
acter intellectually

  but you dont have to understand
it intellectually she reminded him
eagerly why clyde youre not going
back on the still small voice the actors
conscience that speaks in your heart
and tells you how to play youve said
yourself that it was greater than your
reasoning power greater than your
logic and its never failed you yet
why dear dont you remember how
on that opening night in dubuque-
he interrupted her pets i dont be-
lieve they know what good acting is in
dubuque i dont believe you or i know
either

  clyde she gasped

  they had reached the subway sta-
tion he asked for two tickets for
fordham-where stood the little cot-
tage they had moved into with such
pride a week before-and having fed
them to the ticket chopper he sat down
on the bench beside her and tried to
reason it out

  what else can i think i played that
part just as ive rehearsed it here at
home and just as well as i can play it
the bigger theatre didnt rattle menor
being in new york nor anything i did
my best i tell you and what was the
result the first time i tried the stage

manager told me id have to be careful
or id get a laugh on it the second time
one of the girls in the wing did laugh
and he had to threaten her with a fine
and all through the day every speech
i gave there was that same feeling in
those who listened to me-the desire
to laugh their faces showed it well
dont you see theres only one expla-
nation-and my understudy was down
in front with the part this afternoon
oh ill be canned to-morrow all right

  but she would not give up hope so
easily this chance of a new york
appearance meant too much to them all
-too much to her husband to herself
to little bimbi asleep in his cradle and
even to all their friends back there in
dubuque why they had considered her
husband one of the greatest actors in
the world in dubuque they had
crowded the theatre to hear him at
every performance on his benefit night
they had even blocked the street in their
eagerness to buy tickets mr cktyborne
himself the great mr claybome had
said to her with his own lips that once
clyde obtained a hearing in new york
the new york public would never let
him get away oh it couldnt be that
now on this first day before hed even
had a chance to show what he could
do-

  her breath caught and hurt but she
felt her husbands eyes upon her and
the cheerful smile never left her lips
dont you fret at all about it honey
boy she said patting his cheek-to
the great satifaction of the ticket chop-
per who had already sized them up as
honeymooners its coming out all
right and youll have your chance in
new york on opening night yet oh
yes you will pets knows youll see

  and to the casual observer the events
of the next two weeks would have
seemed to justify her prophecy though
the understudy continued to sit in front
he was not so far as the actors could
discover ever called upon to rehearse
and the stage manager never again crit-
icized the leading man as harshly as
on that first day in fact he seemed to
have taken a resolution to avoid criti-
cizing him altogether and lived up to
it except on occasions when the prov-
the new leading man



ocation became too great then he
would burst out with earnestness
mr edwards remember that a farce-
comedy is played in one way and a seri-
ous drama in another now if you can
make us feel that you are a modern
romeo in love with a modern juliet-
edwards tried but he couldnt in
his efforts to avoid farce-comedy he
did however render the part neutral
toned and one day the leading lady-
softened by his alacrity in picking up a
handkerchief for her-told him kindly
that he had greatly improved and that
if he kept on he might yet succeed in
putting it over edwards writhed under
the scant praise remembering how the
other actors were accustomed to stand
around with awe-stricken admiration
while he created a part in dubuque
but he shut his teeth grimly and tried
to take the encouragement as it was
meant after all if a man had got into
the way of over-rating his capabilities
it was probably well that he should find
it out

 and thank heaven they had not
canned him

  the play opened on a thursday even-
ing in a dog town in connecticut be-
yond the reach of new york reporters
and continued there through the week
by the unanimous verdict of the only
daily paper the opening was most suc-
cessful and darbells decision was
destined for a long and prosperous met-
ropolitan career but after the first
performance when the stage manager
had finished supper with the editor and
had written the criticism for him he
walked down to the depot and sent off
a night letter to the old man-who
was detained at home with facial neu-
ralgia-which read like this

    play doubtful but may get over ed-
  wards very bad have sent davies his
  part with full stage directions sorry he
  cannot get here until so late but think
  better to trust opening night to him
  even without rehearsal

                              g griggs

  the stage manager handed his letter
in paid for it and then requested it
back and added a postcript

    p s will not dismiss edwards un-
  til after davies arrival

in

newgyorkck  penig nisht 

  the nerves of everyone connected
with the theatre from the old man
himself to the smallest boy who passed
the drinking cups were as a violin
string keyed up to the highest pitch
and likely to snap at any moment

 in the right upper entrance the lead-
ing lady very tailor-made and correct
in her first act street dress was gnaw-
ing the fingers off her gloves and wish-
ing she had left the stage and married
the millionaire stock broker last season
when she had the chance

  in the left lower entrance the sou-
brette struggled with a nervous chill
while a very frightened super fanned
the back of her neck and the leading
ladys understudy administered ice
water

  at the window in flat the low co-
median in a blue funk was telling the
heavy that from the very first he had
predicted the play would be a failure
and by eleven to-night theyd find out
he was right

  and on the stage center in the midst
of the first act pawnbroking office the
old man wraved a telegram before
griggs dismayed eyes and shouted at
the top of his voice under the impres-
sion he was speaking in a whisper

  griggs look at this will you look
at this a message from davls saying
he cant arrive until nine oclock nine
oclock on opening night in new york
when ive doubled his salary to get him
its an insult-an outrage what excuse
has he what excuse can he have

  he says a railroad accident softly
murmured the stage manager whose
nervousness was of the quiet deadly
kind

  thats no excuse he ought to have
got here some way

  griggs re-read the message he has
chartered an automobile-

  then he should have chartered an
airship does he think im going to
postpone raising my curtain till nine
and have every critic here tired out and
ready to roast the show to-morrow i
wont do it-not if we put on the play
without any leading man at all w here s
edwards 


the green book album

  in his dressing-room making up
of course he suspects nothing so far
but i think wed make a mistake to trust
the part to him hes an absolute non-
entity

  well davies is an it roared the
old man who on ordinary occasions
admired davies exceedingly

 griggs dry-washed his clammy
hands even so hell get the part over
and we know it he doesnt come on
till the last half of the first act and he
says hell arrange his make-up in the
machine i think if we put off raising
the curtain till eight-forty-

  eight-thirty-not a minute later its
been a lifelong principle of mine never
to wear out an audience by makin em
wait and im going to stick to that prin-
ciple eight-thirty never mind what
comes of it do you understand 

  the old man rushed off the stage
and careened full against mrs ed-
wards whom in the excitement of the
moment he took for the leading lady
in her street make-up of the first act

  miss rowley the curtain rises at
eight-thirty and thats final were
hoping davies will be here in time for
his cue but if he isnt edwards goes on
and plays thank heaven we havent
given him his notice yet and you may
be able to pull him through some way
though of course were hoping davies
gets here eight-thirty now do you
understand

  yes sir murmured clydes wife
fleeing from him and indeed she did
understand only too well

  in the dim entry way which led to her
husbands dressing-room she paused
and clutched her hand about the locket
upon her neck where rested bimbis
picture oh baby she murmured as
if to his little living comforting pres-
ence when you grow up dear be a
lawyer or a doctor or a civil engineer
or anything like that if you can-be a
hod carrier if you must but never
never be an actor theyre too cruel to
you when youre that-they break your
heart

  but she pulled herself together and
choked back the tears resolutely of
course she must carry a smiling face to
clydes door of course he musnt

know not as long as there was a chance
even a chance-

  is that you pets

  yes clyde dear

  bully i was afraid you wouldnt get
around before the curtain went up
come in the dressers gone he
hugged her boyishly as she entered he
had always suffered less from stage
fright than most actors and now she
saw that he was in the highest spirits
pets dear ive got a hunch that im
going to make a big hit to-night
have you clyde she forced her
lips to say with the stereotyped smile
still upon them

  yes ive been thinking over this-
this sort of failure of mine to make
good you know and i can see just how
it happened it was that little soubrettes
laugh the first day thats responsible for
the whole thing

  do you think so dear

  im sure of it after that i got
afraid of myself and afraid of the
part for fear somebody else would
laugh why i didnt do anything up in
connecticut - they wouldnt have
known i was on the stage id toned it
all down so you understand but to-
night i just feel its in me to go out
there and play up and get them just
as i used to get them in dubuque
laugh  the audience wont laugh why
should they no one ever saw anything
funny in my acting before and perhaps
that girl was laughing at some joke of
her own anyway oh ill show em a
little what i can do to-night

  i hope so clvde

   hope so i wuir he was sure
of it

  he gave his make-up a last critical
inspection and then hurried her onto
the stage to watch the curtain go up
do you know that kid from the dra-
matic school who plays the typewriter
girl has the first speech  only one she
does have all the way through but its
enough to scare the wits out of her to
open the play isnt it

  on the stage the excitement had in-
creased a hundred per cent and the
stage manager was having hard work to
make the old man take any notice
the new leading man



whatever of a card which had just been
handed in from the audience

  its from the author whispered
griggs in an awe-stricken voice he
says he returned from australia sooner
than he expected hes in front

  hey

  the author of the play you know
he landed in boston at three this after-
noon and took the fast express hes
out there in one of the orchestra seats
now-

  then let him stay there snapped
out the old man fiercely if we could
get along without authors in this busi-
ness id pay double the royalties hang
authors they stay away from rehear-
sals get rid of all the worry of it and
then sit out in front and find fault be-
cause it isnt done to suit em ill bet
you a thousand dollars that if this play
fails to-night that chap out there in the
orchestra seat-

  he stopped because the stage mana-
ger wasnt listening to him no one was
listening to him they were all listen-
ing to the overture and the overture
was drawing to a close

  oh my gawd said the character
woman her fat hand clutching her
heart

  the overture had ended and there
came a moment of deathlike silence it
was as if the entire three thousand
people in the audience were holding
their breath in a gasp of suspense
then

  ting-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling and the
curtain had gone up

  it was the proudest moment in the
life of the girl from the dramatic
school when after delivering her
maiden speech in a voice which did not
shake and could be heard throughout
the theatre she walked off the stage
to be immediately swallowed up in the
congratulatory embraces of a dozen
excited fellow actors

  the play went on far too quickly for
the frightened mummers waiting for
their cues but slowly far too slowly
for clydes wife

  twenty-five minutes later the old
man watching the audience with a keen
and experienced eye believed that so

far they were all to the good the sou-
brette had been kindly received the
low comedian and the character woman
had scored individual hits the scene
between the leading lady and the heavy
which developed the plot was being lis-
tened to with close attention the old
man turned to find griggs standing be-
side him and in the relief of the
moment he gave him a humorous dig
with his elbow

   well griggsy boy it looks to me
as if we were holdin em all right
if davies comes to save the leading
man but theres only five minutes
more almost whimpered griggs who
was as white as a sheet he dry-washed
his hands again as he listened for the
sound of davies voice at the stage
door

   clydes wife was listening for the
same sound but she kept the smile on
her lips after all her husband might
get his chance-the time was so short
now

   well pets its pretty near my cue
yes dear she was shaking like a
leaf

   nervous about me eh forget it i
tell you im going to make good indif-
ferent to the grinning scene-shifters he
put his arms about her and with un-
wonted seriousness kissed her full on
the lips it would be a pretty sort of a
chap that couldnt make good for you
-and the little fellow at home he
whispered tenderly

  her lithe form relaxed in his em-
brace then suddenly stiffened she had
heard the opening of the stage door and
a mans breathless voice asking for
griggs clyde she gasped pushing
him toward his entrance go on-go

on now

   why pets that isnt my cue ihe
cue is if i owned a fairy godmother
i would ask her to give me-

   oh dont wait for that you can tell
them you made a mistake go now i ou
must i tell you you must

- but pets youre crazy i can t

  a man in full stage make-up had
appeared in the wing and was being
rushed toward them by griggs clyde s
wife turned faint but at that instant
came the leading womans voice


the green book album

  if i owned a fairy godmother i
would ask her to give me-

  give you what cried the leading
man bounding onto the stage

  in his make-up edwards looked like
a blond viking prince and a murmur
of admiration nestled through the fem-
inine portion of the audience they
clapped softly while their escorts con-
sulted their programs clyde ed-
wards a new name one of the old
mans finds doubtless well edwards
looks all right but the question is can
he act then they settled back to pass
judgment upon him

  by george griggs theres nothing
the matter with that chap whispered
the old man hoarsely after edwards
first long speech call him a nonentity
why he blazes

  but griggs was clutching the scenery
a picture of helpless rage and despair
the fool-the idiot he cried softly
and to think that in one moment more
davies could have got in

  but isnt edwards playing this all
right 

  hes not playing the part at all hes
doing as he did that first day making a
burlesque of it oh it doesnt matter
for a page or two here at first but
when it comes to the serious work the
love scenes theyll laugh at him youll
see tears stood in the managers eyes

  but all unconscious of danger the
leading man went blindly and hopefully
on his way and by and by-

  i do not love you avowed the lead-
ing woman

  but i love you-will always love
you and ill win your love in return
you may not believe it but i will re-
sponded the leading man and a ripple
of laughter ran through the audience

  a look of stunned surprise came into
the leading mans eyes at the corner
of his mouth the little muscle began to
twitch

  the leading woman bit her lip tone
it down youll kill the scene she
whispered angrily and then in her
high clear voice im sorry that our
companionship this summer should
have ended so

  edwards knew that if the audience
laughed again both himself and the

play were lost he put all the ardor and

emotion of which he was capable into
the next speech he thought of his wife
watching from the wings he thought
of little bimbi asleep in the cradle at
home he prayed even as he was de-
livering the lines that he would be
guided to give them aright

  and the audience laughed again

  after that a sort of despairing dog-
gedness took possession of him he
didnt try to tone the part down he told
himself that as he had begun so he
would go through it to the end the
mischief was done it was too late to
change now besides he couldnt
change he wasnt saying those words
it was that other self of his that inner
voice on which as an actor he had al-
ways depended why oh why should
it have played him false now 

  and the audience continued to laugh
they always laughed-always at every
line

  the other actors made way for him
as he rushed off the stage past them all
down to the friendly darkness of his
dressing-room but his wife was there
before him

  oh clyde dear oh honey boy
im so sorry

  she put out her arms and he buried
his head on her breast as bimbi might
have done hiding himself in her mother
love to shut out the cruelty of the
world

  its all over pets all over i can
never act again

  oh dont say that honey boy

  from above there came the muffled
clapping of many hands curtain all
in first act on stage for curtain
shouted the call boy and passed on

  it isnt just failing in the part i
could stand that but when those people
out there began to laugh at me they
killed something in my soul-my belief
in myself if i live to be a thousand  
never get it back again

  curtain all in front for the cur-
tain the call boy w-as pounding on the
door

  he clung to her closer i cant do it
pets i cant face that crowd out there
again not even to finish the play it
would kill me oh pets i cant

               the new leading man

--



  and you neednt honey boy ill
tell them youre ill and they must put
the other man in your place oh hes
ready for it she said bitterly he
was ready when you went on the stage
to-night she kissed him and listen
clyde dear i dont like new york its
so cold and cruel to-morrow well
leave fordham and go back to dubu-
que where they know us and love us
clayborne wrote me yesterday that the
new leading man wasnt making good
hell be glad to take you on- and the
old crowd will all come down to the
train to meet us im sure they will
they were our friends there you know
oh clyde wont it be good to see old
bill harrock again and funny little
tads-

  thus she crooned her husband com-
fort rocking him back and forth in her
arms while the pounding outside grew
to a perfect pandemonium of fists
which at last could not be disregarded
even by their all-absorbing misery ed-
wards staggered to his feet and threw
open the door

  go away he cried fiercely dont
come here with any kicks havent you
got heart enough to let a man alone
when hes down

  but none of the excited group out-
side heard a word of it

  congratulations yelled the old
man in hilarious joy working clydes
right hand up and down like a pump
handle boy youre made

  congratulations shouted a chorus
back of him

  congratulations murmured a lit-
erary individual with a boston accent
seizing clydes left hand and treating
it the same way as the author of the
play allow me to say that you are ful-
filling my ideal and more allow me to
say that i can think of no other young
actor at present on the boards who
could without burlesque bring out all
the delicate and subtle humor of this
difficult comedy part

  comedy part echoed clyde he
clutched the side of the door for sup-
port and his eyes involuntarily sought
those of the stage director who was
standing third in the line griggs hesi-
tated for a moment and then because
he was a gentleman he came up and
held out his hand

  everythings on me he said it
was that line about earnestness and sin-
cerity that started me wrong and i kept
right on mr edwards you never take
anything i know but would that baby
of yours prefer an opening night sou-
venir of a silver rattle or a teething
ring

  and while clydes dazed brain was
still wrestling with this important ques-
tion the call boy pounced down upon
the group and in his frenzied excite-
ment included the author the stage
manager and even the old man him-
self in one scathing condemnation

  what tell are youse all doin keep-
in de lead from his curtains dont ye

here is another bouquet of piquant anecdotes
sonalities who have made broadway famous

on broadway this is the
open season for ante-prandial
cocktails and post-prandial ora-
tory he who really is of broad-
way who gains admittance and wel-
come to the innermost circles of the
rialtos elect may during the months
of january february and march keep
his date book filled with appoint-
ments that mean a party of some
sort for every night in the week-in-
cluding sunday

  as some one long ago remarked
the chief diversion of new yorkers
is eating and immediately following
the holidays there is scarcely an even-

concerning a number of the interesting per-

ing which has not its beefsteak sup-
per its banquet or its formal din-
ner of some kind at which the same
faces are seen night after night

  indeed a flawless digestion an ex-
tensive repertoire of dress shirts and
a complacent and patient wife are es-
sential to the complete enjoyment of
a chronic broadway diner-out for
example during a period of four
weeks immediately preceding the pen-
ning of these chronicles there have
come and gone the annual dinner of
the american dramatists club at del-
monicos the twelfth night clubs
dinner and entertainment at the
chronicles of broadway

berkley lyceum-also an annual affair-the friars

monster party and dinner to sam h harris at the
hotel astor the annual banquet of the association 
of theatre managers at the hotel knickerbocker fit

lier william colliers midnight supper to george m f-
cohan the messrs cohan and colliers midnight sup-

chanan bradys elaborate dinner at home the new
years revel at the players-and the big jubilee din-
ner to messrs weber and fields in immediate pros-
pect oh there are many many others but loss of
sleep has induced a loss of memory that renders a
more prolonged recital too arduous a task

  augustus thomas never misses

 at nearly every one of these affairs one may
count with certainty upon augustus thomas pres-
ence mr thomas name always is the first one
thought of in preparing a list of after-dinner speak-
ers he has no superior and perhaps no equal in
that particular form of monologue rendering also he
possesses a dignity and a pre-eminence that raise the k
general average of the gatherings which he graces

 mr thomas always speaks his method is sim-
ple of the toastmaster or presiding officer he requests
that he be placed number  on the bill-to drift
into vaudeville parlance upon what his predecessors
have said he bases his remarks while they are speak-
ing he makes copious notes on the tablecloth usually
consuming the area allotted to himself and his neigh-
bor on either side then he arises to pick flaws in the
assertions of those who have gone before and to poke
good-natured fun at them

  occasionally he repeats himself but this is seldom-
which is a remarkable thing inasmuch as he is eter-
nally at it and never seems at a loss for an apt retort

he is guilty of such a repetition but once this season
according to the score that is kept of these events
and therefore his batting average may be said to be
considerably above 

  at the dinner of the american dramatists club
where he presided one of the speakers found much
fault with the theatre and stoutly urged radical re-
forms the speaker was not a man whose achieve-
ments carried much weight and his suggestions were
not received seriously by his hearers


the green book album

   in reply mr thomas spoke of mark twains de-
  scription of the sandwich islands which mr twain
 had declared to be picturesque perfection observing
 that he could think of but one improvement and that
 was to move the mountains nearer to the shore

  and added mr twain according to mr thomas
 i dont want to be obliged to speak of it again

   it was this same joke that mr thomas turned on
 himself at the dinner of the managers association
 he had spoken with great earnestness of a needed
 reform in the theatrical business and the assembled
 magnates had listened listlessly and yawned where-
 upon mr thomas appreciating the humor of the
 situation related again mr twains comment on the
 sandwich islands

what hammerstein smokes

   at that same dinner my nearest neighbor was
 oscar hammerstein who had arrived from london
 that morning for a visit of three days in new york
 between courses we discussed at length mr ham-
 mersteins london opera season he happened to re-
 mark during the conversation that he had taken apart-
 ments in the hotel savoy perhaps londons most
 luxurious hotel just then a waiter passed cigars--of
 a brand so costly that they are not on sale except at
 the stands of a few leading hotels

   mr hammerstein shook his head sighed and took
 from his own cigar case a long black cigar which
 bore a general resemblance to a pittsburg stogie
 remembering that the impresario always fancied a
 certain powerful weed of his own make i said to him
 by the way what do you do for your cigars in
 london 

    i have them made special he replied but that is
 not entirely satisfactory and i am having my cigar
 machinery installed in my apartments and hereafter
 will make them myself

   theres versatility for you-a man who overcomes
 all traditions and establishes an opera house in oppo-
 sition to covent garden and who also manufactures
 his own cigars in the gaudy apartments of the savoy

wilder missed a chance

   at this same gathering mr hammerstein told
 how nearly he and marshall p wilder the misses
 size humorist once came to being partners and how
 it was that wilder lost an opportunity of becoming
 half owner of the prosperous victoria theatre


chronicles of broadway



  wilders friendship with hammerstein dates back
fully twenty years at the time to which hammer-
stein referred the indomitable oscar had just lost
possession of the new york theatre-then the olym-
pia-and if ostrich plumes had been selling at ten
cents a bunch it is doubtful if he could have pur-
chased a pin feather

  wilder always thrifty usually had an abundance
of ready money to console and comfort his old friend
after the loss of the biggest theatre in all manhattan
wilder called upon hammerstein they chatted on
general topics for a while and then hammerstein
said

  marshall if you have  you care to invest
i can make you a rich man also it will help me out
in a scheme

  thats too bad replied the little humorist for
i havent a cent for investment i put  yester-
day into a watch company and it is every penny i
can spare at this time

  wilder was telling the truth but fearing that his
friend might doubt him he called again the follow-
ing day and showed the certificates of stock he had
purchased

  that really is unfortunate declared hammer-
stein i intended to use your  to build another
theatre and of course you would have owned one-
half of it as it is i am going to build it anyhow

  how much capital have you asked wilder

  seven dollars replied hammerstein

  and he too was telling the truth for with only
seven dollars as his entire earthly possessions he
manipulated a scheme whereby the victoria theatre
at seventh avenue and forty-second street was
built and which as everyone knows is now worth
fully a million dollars and as a vaudeville house
clears annually 

  wilder still holds his watch company stock and it
is a reasonably good investment he often sighs how-
ever when he thinks of the chance offered him by
hammerstein to be a real magnate

dockstader meant well

  it was new years day lew dockstader the
minstrel and jean havez the man who has written
so many of his songs walked out of their hotel to-
gether and turned into broadway

  they had gone scarcely a block when they encoun-
tered a comedian whose name shall not be mentioned
but who is known wherever vaudeville flourishes as
 

the green book album

one of the most brilliant of monologue artists and the

possessor of an insatiable thirst

  the comedian was maudlin from liquor also he
was unkempt unshaven and generally soiled he rec-
ognized dockstader and his companion and demanded
their attention in his drunken way he muttered that
he was concluding a protracted carouse that he
wished to reform and that if he could go to bridge-
port the hospitality of a friends home and a weeks
vaudeville engagement awaited him

  he appeared to be sincere certainly his condition
was pitiable and dockstader and havez decided to
lend a helping hand a programe of a bath a shave
a visit to a manicure parlor and a complete change
of clothing was outlined

  in a cab the unfortunate man was taken to a turk-
ish bath at first the attendant refused to accept the
cargo dockstader pleaded his eloquence and a sub-
stantial tip prevailed the comedian was carried into
a room stripped bathed rubbed vigorously and put
to bed

  the following day dockstader and havez called at
the baths with a complete new outfit for the penitent
he came forth looking like a new man

  ill never forget your kindness he said and he
seemed to mean it

  now that i am straightened out again he con-
tinued i will go to bridgeport remain with my
friend until monday and then begin a weeks engage-
ment at polis i have many bookings to follow but
i think i should have just one good drink to give me
a little nerve thats the last though never again
for me

  dockstader led him to a near by cafe the three
took a parting drink then dockstader summoned a
cab and the comedian was escorted to the grand cen-
tral station dockstader purchased a ticket for bridge-
port thrust it into the comedians hand together with
a five-dollar bill and personally saw him aboard the
train

  there were tears in the comedians eyes when he
said farewell to his two friends as the train slowly
moved out of the station he leaned far out of the win-
dow and waved his hand

  this has all been a terrible nuisance remarked
dockstader to havez as they left the station and
turned into forty-second street but its been worth
the trouble i feel better for it

   so do i replied havez lets step into this cafe
and have just one drink

  the one drink led to others and it was perhaps an
chronicles of broadway



hour later when the two emerged and walked towards
broadway they turned into times square and were
just crossing forty-third street when out of the door
of the hotel cadillacs cafe pitched their reformed
friend headlong-beastly drunk

  he had left the train at the th street station
taken the subway to times square and lost not a mo-
ment in making for the nearest barroom

 about every little movement

  the sudden death of karl hoschna the composer
recalls the narrow margin of circumstance by which
the song every little movement has a meaning
all its own and consequently madame sherry
attained their tremendous vogue it is no reflection
upon the judgment of george w lederer the pro-
ducer of madame sherry that he did not foresee
the popularity of the song the man does not live
who can recognize a song hit in advance of a pub-
lic test

  for that matter mr hoschna himself laid no great
stress upon the melody of every little movement
as i have excellent reason to know since he played
it for me long before madame sherry was written
and said merely that he hoped to find use for it some
time

  therefore mr lederer is not to be blamed because
he placed no reliance upon it during the rehearsals
of madame sherry the fact is that he had so little
faith in the song that he made it the opening num-
ber-almost certain death furthermore he entrusted
it to frances demarest a young woman who still had
her reputation to earn and whose ability mr lederer
regarded at that time as chiefly negative

  almost at the eleventh hour of the rehearsal period
joseph smith was called in by mr lederer to stage
the musical numbers mr smith had not met miss
demarest at that time

  ive got a song entitled every little movement 
explained lederer that isnt much good at least if
it is any good its merits will never become known
for a black horse named demarest is singing it a
dance should go with the song because it concerns
a dance and perhaps you can teach that ice wagon
to do it

  ill teach miss demarest a dance for that song
reported smith after the first rehearsal and unless
i am greatly mistaken you will be surprised in the
way that song will go

  the outcome is now known in every city in this
the green book album

country large enough to maintain a theatre madame
sherry largely because of every little move
ment has earned fortunes for everybody concernec 
in its production it established mr hoschna ovei 
night as a popular composer and brought him more
contracts than he could fulfill miss demarest shared
in the general success and sang and danced the num-
ber during the long chicago and new york rung

  and mr smith fell in love with miss demarest
and married her

williams paid his tribute

  at the dinner of the theatre managers associa-
tion mentioned earlier in this installment of chron-
icles percy williams the vaudeville manager took
a final shot at a once celebrated institution which is
now but a memory

  on the menu cover was the picture of the interior
of a theatre the stage curtain was raised and the
musicians were in their pit but not a seat in the audi-
torium was occupied

  i think remarked mr wiliams as he arose in
response to president charles burnhams introduction
that our committee has paid a fine compliment to
our fellow-member henry b harris i see that on
the menu cover they have printed a picture of the
folies bergere on a busy night

john the barber again

    i had thought never again to write in these
chronicles a chapter of john the barbers life but
he has recently been the chief figure in an incident
so extraordinary that to withhold it from readers of
the chronicles would be a breach of faith

  to those who have not already made john the
barbers acquaintance in these pages it should be
explained that he conducts the rialtos most popular
tonsorial establishment-an establishment financed by
leading managers and actors-that he is sportively in-
clined by nature that he has made several incursions
into the theatrical field to his sorrow and that his
real name is john j reisler

   not long ago reisler presented to his wife a valu-
able diamond necklace on new years eve accom-
panied by mrs reisler and the necklace he entered
society by a route known as the pekin restaurant
located in the very heart of the long acre district
and in the pekin mrs reisler was stripped of her
necklace reisler said it had been frisked
chronicles of broadway



  great and profound was the grief that followed
persistent search brought no results and reisler
finally was moved to advertise a reward of  for
the return of the diamonds and no questions asked
it was exactly like a heartless rialto contingent to
avail itself of this opportunity to play a cruel joke
upon the disconsolate barber a few days later it
must be told to the discredit of the perpetrators reis-
ler was summoned to the telephone by a strange
voice the voice informed him that the necklace would
be returned provided he was sincere in the statement
of no questions asked

  to obtain the lost gems continued the voice reis-
ler must present himself at seven oclock that evening
at the cigar stand in the hotel plaza and blow his
nose three times in a red bandanna handkerchief also
he must bring the reward the possessor of the neck-
lace if reisler appeared to be acting in good faith
would then exchange the property for the 

  with great care reisler prepared for his visit to the
plaza a hotel which he never before had entered he
was more than ordinarily careful about his toilet
dressing in evening clothes and adorning his shirt
front with the chipped-diamond studs designed to rep-
resent tiny shaving mugs which he seldom wore ex-
cept at the annual ball of the larry mulligan outing
and literary club

  one minute before seven oclock he entered the
plaza and walked directly to the cigar stand in the
lobby leaning over the counter ostentatiously he
pulled a gaudy bandanna handkerchief from his pocket
and blew vigorously on his nose three times he
waited then he repeated the operation again and
again came the blasts but the necklace seemed as far
away as ever

  pretty bad cold you have remarked the cigar
clerk sympathetically

  cold-nothin retorted reisler say young fel-
low is there another cigar stand in this hotel

  well rather replied the clerk there are six
others-one in the mens restaurant one in the cafe
one in the rathskeller-oh all over the place

  reisler started out on the rounds from one cigar
stand to another he journeyed always pausing at each
one long enough to give three vigorous blasts and dis-
play the danger signal to the various nooks and
corners of the hotel he wandered serenading each
cigar stand in its turn until finally his nose was the
color of the bandanna

  it was nearly ten oclock when he became sus-
picious and concluded the concert with one final burst

of snorts and explosions designed to take in all the
ju  cigar stands at once then with a glare in his eyes
he left the hotel and dashed for his barber shop

   there he found awaiting his return a crowd of rois-
terers who made no effort to conceal their mirth
reisler daubed his nose with cold cream before he
relieved his mind of his sufferings his verbal on-
slaught is said to have surpassed ben teals tirade
the morning that miss hattie forsythe accused that
resolute stage manager of stifling her art by costum-
ing her in a gown that reached below her knees

  and when reisler had ended his rebuke arthur
klein one of the parlors regular patrons stepped for-
ward and solemnly announced that the customers had
rechristened him little boy blew

spectacle of a big fire give mme simone the fire every
time the great french actress love of a fire amounts
to a passion and the only misunderstanding that has
arisen between her and george c tyler manager of
her american tour developed on the day of the burn-

  the most important production of mme simones
american season-the return from jerusalem-
was about to be launched and a rehearsal had been
called at the hudson theatre at ten oclock in the
morning mme simone who is her own stage direc-
tor and who is accustomed to the most rigid disci-
pline as a result of her training in paris arose at
eight oclock ordered her coffee and rolls and sat
down to this light breakfast with a morning news-
paper in her hand

  the equitable building was by this time burning
briskly but the morning papers had gone to press too
early to carry the news as the actress was about to
enter a cab in front of her hotel two hours later a
newsboy passed by crying terrible fire special
extra

   mme simone purchased a paper glanced at the glar-
ing headlines and ordered the cabbie to take her direct-

morning and of course mme simone was not able
to get within a block of the fire lines nevertheless
she hovered about the scene for more than an hour
with her maid catching glimpses of the firemen the
ambulances and the squads of policemen and picking
up news of the disaster as it was repeated by the
crowd

  she arrived at the hudson theatre shortly before
noon where she found an impatient company and a
peevish manager awaiting her mr tyler addressed
her somewhat frigidly but he softened under the great 
actress reply

julian mitchells faux pas

 opposite the name of julian mitchell the
stage director must be set a black mark denoting an
error of judgment his faux pas was committed at
the new york theatre on the occasion of the special
new years eve performance by the follies of 
organization

  for this one sunday night concert members of the
follies company which was playing in philadel-
phia were brought to new york a large gathering
of player folk had assembled to avail themselves of
this opportunity to observe brother and sister artists
in action among them was lillian lorraine formerly
a member of the follies organization but now the
leading woman in over the river she had come to
new york from boston to witness the performance
and with a party of friends sat in a stage box

  as one after another of the follies company
stepped upon the stage they recognized miss lor-
raine and smiled at her and mr mitchell who was
directing the performance from the first entrance con-
ceived the idea of interpolating her unannounced into
the program he waited until the big dancing num-
ber from the follies show in which miss lorraine
formerly had been the feature and then without a
word of warning instructed leon erol to jump into
the stage box seize miss lorraine drag her upon the
stage and perform her original dance with her

  miss lorraine was startled to say the least when
erol sprang over the rail and lifted her in her gor-
geous evening raiment upon the stage but alas
when miss lorraine raised her skirts to dance an
awful secret was disclosed in packing her bag for the
hurried trip from boston miss lorraines maid had
committed an error in the selection of hosiery and
when the comedienne blushing furiously lifted the
skirt of her handsome gown she revealed two ankles
one of which was encased in a black stocking the
other in pink

a real romance of the stage by a well-known
comedian

elsie norman leading woman
with the boston stock company
sat in her dressing room all pow-
dered and patched waiting for the cur-
tain to rise on the opening performance
of the gallant cavalier the leading
man john hillerman stood in the
opened door talking with her as she
dabbed at her face with the rouge paw
both were young and both were nerv-
ous this was the first new play the
company had produced since their ele-
vation to the leading parts it wras in
the days when stock companies were
the real aristocracy in theatrical circles
before the star system came into style
also it was in the days when the spot-
light was operated from the wings by
a man using calcium lights

  elsie said the leading man my
nerves are all on the jump sometimes
 think this cavalier will prove a win-
ner and sometimes i think hell be left



at the post i wish i knew something
about this arthur berson the man who
wrote it

  ive wondered about him too re-
plied miss norman it seems strange
no one knows anything about him who
is he

  mason knows-but he wont tell
mason says he and berson robbed
orchards together when they were kids
but hes such a shy fellow he doesnt
want his identity kmnvn unless his play
is a success

  well mr mason is pretty young
himself the leading woman remarked
between dabs but hes shown good
judgment in picking winners so far
maybe he has found another

  if berson only had a name i
wouldnt feel so shaky hillerman
grumbled

  now john elsie retorted sup-
pose mr mason had never given you a
switching the spotlight

leading part until after you had made
j a name would you ever get it

  oh well you-er-you-see-
of course she laughed i see
real merit always will get to the top
eh perhaps this berson has real
merit

  dont you feel shaky about the new
piece 

  no i dont elsie was emphatic
im sure the play is good and if it fails
it will be mostly our fault im a little
nervous about myself though

  get out hillerman exclaimed in-
credulously you nervous  why thats
absurd

   it isnt either perhaps you havent
noticed how for the last two months
that new spotlight man has been star-
ing at me all during the performances
you mean butler hillerman
asked ive noticed he seemed a bit
cracked

  sometimes john it makes me feel
creepy when i look up and see those
dark eyes glaring at me

  forget it hillerman laughed i
should think youd be used by this time
to having men fall in love with you and
look as if they wanted to devour you
sometimes i get that bad about you
myself

  she evaded his admiring glance
ignored the compliment and returned
to the spotlight man asking

  do you know anything about him 
not a thing except that mason lets
him keep the job-and that he evidently
has good taste

  please dont be foolish john she
said simply im serious about this i
feel sorry for butler ive talked with
him a few times and he seems like a
gentleman but i dont like the way he
stares at me and if he does it to-night
im afraid ill make some bad slip-ups
in my work

  the call boys voice came to them
telling them to get ready for the curtain
and john spoke hurriedly as they eft
the dressing room

  dont worry elsie ill look after
this butler there was a threatening
note in his voice that caused elsie to
drop her hand on his arm hillerman
laughed curtly dont be afraid there



wont be any row besides he added
g ad that she was so concerned atom

an right    ake care f

  they separated john hurrying to the
other side of the stage they did not
see each other again until their first
entrance simultaneously from opposite
sides elsie as lady marie rushing into
tne arms of john as the gallant cava-
lier upon his sudden return from a dan-
gerous mission

  the new play went with a rush from
the very first moment and the interest
of the audience increased continually
until the house was charged with en-
thusiasm this inspired every member
of the company to try to put on more
steam and get better results and when
the curtain went down at the end of
the first act manager mason-who also
acted as stage director-assured them
that it was the best work they had ever
done

  the last act brought the audience to
their feet and the people were waving
handkerchiefs and shouting when the
final curtain was rung down to go up
and down repeatedly while the mem-
bers of the company were bowing and
smiling and the audience were clapping
their hands and shouting butler stood
in the wings his eyes fastened greedily
upon the leading woman his fingers
clenched his feet beating a nervous tat-
too on the floor while the curtain was
in midair the spotlight man darted for-
ward grasped elsie in his arms and
kissed her several times exclaiming
god how beautiful you are

  the audience gasped and quieted im-
mediately hillerman and others sprang
upon butler and pulled him back into
the wings as the curtain dropped elsie
did not scream but her face grew white
and then reddened with shame and an-
ger mason rushed to her side but
before he could speak she turned and
cried to hillerman

  dont hurt him john hes mad-
the audience were shouting for miss
norman and manager mason realized
that another sight of her unharme 
would be necessary to avert a possible
panic he ordered the curtain raised
and he and elsie stood alone on the


the green book album

stage as she calling to her aid all her
art bowed and smiled as though
nothing unpleasant had happened the

quick-witted manager addressed the

audience

  you must pardon the impetuous
joy of the author over the success of
his first plav and the wonderful man-
ner in which miss norman contributed

to that success

  the people cheered as elsie turned
and stared at mason he with a depre-
catory smile explained

  there was no other way out of it
miss norman besides mason
grinned i think that little speech of
mme will make this play live quite a
bit longer  call it a good bit of quick
thinking on my part

  but the real author mr berson
she gasped what will he say

   dont care mason laughed he
brought it on himself for keeping in the
background false modesty ive told
him ill make it all right with him
though

  what will you do with butler she
asked with evident interest

  dont you think he ought to be fired
bodily-if some one hasnt already done
it

  no dont do that elsie stopped
him as he started savagely away lets
talk with him awhile perhaps he is in
trouble

  well mason laughed i would
think  was in trouble if i stood in his
place come along well see whats left
of him

  they found butler hillerman and
another member of the company in ma-
sons office the spotlight man was the
calmest of the three and seemed obliv-
ious of the presence of the others as he
gazed into space the others were re-
lieved when miss norman and mason
appeared

  please let me throw him out elise
hillerman pleaded

  she did not answer but turned and
spoke quietly to the man

  mr butler dont you think you owe
me an apology 

  he laughed softly  owe you more
than an apology

  dont be impudent mason re-

torted what explanation have you to

give

  very little butler replied i just
couldnt help it that may he an expla-
nation i think it is a justification too
but im sorry-not sorry i did it but

sorry because it offended miss nor-
man

  well of all the nerve hillerman
was too indignant for more words and
he stalked out growling excuse me
please if i stay here another minute
ill be tempted to do something rough
youll find me outside in a few min-
utes butler called to the leading man

  here stop that mason interrupted
no fighting around here you expect
to be discharged butler

  id be surprised if i were not
well youll not get your surprise
youre fired

  wait a moment mr mason elsie
who had been examining butler fur-
tively spoke nervously he doesnt
look like a bad man why not give him
another chance

  what mason looked greatly sur-
prised why miss norman do you
realize what you are saying

  yes her reply came softly i do
but i think mr butler will promise to
be good and not to do anything except
his own work-and i believe he will
keep his promise

  youve got a lot more faith than i
have then mason retorted thats
faith enough almost to move a whole
mountain range

  wont you mr butler elsie
ignored mason

  the spotlight mans face brightened
of course he said quickly th
promise and ill keep the promise-as
long as you are here

  elsie flushed tossed her head and
left but butler was retained to the
amazement of the players and the
other employees and to the intense dis-
gust of john hillerman

  mason considered the opportunity too
good to overlook so the first stories
that appeared in the newspapers about
berson and miss norman on the open-
ing performance were followed by
ottiers inspired by mason and founded
upon just as much fact it was good
switching the spotlight



for pages in the boston papers and col-
umns in outside papers the press all
over the country was soon telling how
berson the young playwright had be-
come so smitten by miss normans
charms that he had written the gal-
lant cavalier especially for her and
it was rumored that the play would
result in a wedding

  hillerman was wild and miss nor-
man put her foot down firmly as soon
as she learned what wras being done
it was too late then mason explained
we cant stop the other papers from
copying what has appeared he said

  the fame of elsie norman and the
gallant cavalier and its author spread
rapidly miss norman was bombarded
with offers from other theatrical man-
agers the producers of plays started a
frantic but vain search for berson the
author persistently refused to be known
except through his play and through
his friend mason who also attended
to all of his theatrical business for him

  its a nuisance mason explained to
elsie one night as they stood in the
wings near the spotlight and if it
wasnt on account of our old friend-
ship id make arthur come out and do
his own work

  but why doesnt he 

  oh mason laughed hes still a
bit shy you see hes still wondering
whether this piece has succeeded be-
cause of its own merit or because of
you he wants to write another and see
if he can repeat

  the gallant cavalier ran for ten
weeks in boston a long run in those
days no further trouble was experi-
enced from the vagaries of the spot-
light man who faithfully kept his prom-
ise although he continued to devour
miss norman with his eyes hillerman
road with jealousy on account of miss
normans increasing interest in the un-
known berson vented his spite on but-
ler miss norman had grown so accus-
tomed to the silent admiration of the
spotlight man that it did not trouble
her when he was absent one night and
hillerman commented on the fact she
aroused the fury of the leading man by
answering

  its funny isnt it but i seem to

act better when butler is here i miss

  v  s absent
d	 ijillerman replied shortly i

a wav and	jad t have him

f y and ashamed to look him in the

faerzrus-after yhat has happened
hen has behayed since then hasnt

  maybe you think so the leading
man retorted some people dont seem
to care who admires them

  mr butler is at least a gentleman
she replied with quiet dignity

  then hillerman apologized and tried
to win back the ground he thought he
had lost but when the company went
to new york there existed a coolness
between these two that became more
and more noticeable as time wore on
when the company returned to boston
miss norman remained in new york
this was an excuse for the newspapers
to publish a story of another shattered
stage romance on account of profes-
sional jealousy that both miss nor-
man and hillerman denied it seemed
to make the papers more firm in their
assurance that it was true

  the gallant cavalier remained in
new york until the end of the season
and during the summer vacation miss
norman was offered the principal role
in a new play the right woman
written mason informed her by ber-
son especially for her during the re-
hearsals she frequently wished that she
might consult with the author about
certain points but he persisted in keep-
ing hidden and communicated his ideas
to her either through mason or by let-
ter the letter route gradually being
given the preference

  that fall the right woman was
produced and was as big a success as
the gallant cavalier both the play
and miss normans personal work it
ran until after the holidays and at the
first of the year mason decided to take
the company headed by miss norman
on a tour of the country to play both of
the berson pieces it was a triumphal
tour but when the pacific coast was
reached the leading man tom mar-
shall became ill he struggled bravely
to continue his work but the strain was
too great when mason saw that mai-


the green book album

shall could not keep going he began a
frantic search for a man to take his
place just before they reached san
francisco he received a telegram from
berson which partly reassured him and
at the same time gave him more cause
for worry berson wired

    am still looking for another leading
  man but in the meantime  will play
  the part will be on hand monday right
  keep tom going until then

  elsies excitement spread to the rest
of the company and became more tense
as the hour for bersons appearance
drew nearer he could not reach san
francisco before six oclock monday
evening and would be forced to hurry
in order not to delay the performance
mason left the stage manager in charge
of things and went to the station to
meet berson he left orders that every-
thing should proceed exactly as usual
with toms substitute ready to play the
part of the cavalier in case berson
failed to appear on time

  half an hour before time for the cur-
tain to be rung up elsie her make-up
complete except for a few little touches
opened the door of her dressing room
and asked the stage manager if mr
berson had arrived

  no he replied curtly train must
have been late now dont get excited
miss norman this play will go right
along even if tom is too sick to work
and even if berson does fail to show
up

  five minutes later mason accom-
panied by a stranger rushed through
the stage door and hurried to toms
dressing room in another thirty
seconds everyone about the stage knew
that berson had arrived at ten min-
utes after eight mason went to miss
norman to reassure her

  keep calm elsie he said every-
things all right youll not be disap-
pointed in berson im sure but you
musnt get so excited that you will dis-
appoint him

how can i keep from being excited 
who could under the circumstances
well mason laughed get just
as excited as you want to but for heav-
ens sake dont lose your head

  the call boy passed crying first

 act first act and miss norman started
 to her feet peered at the half darkened
 stage and shook her head then she
 saw a figure emerge from toms dress-
 ing room and come and stand in the
 wings dressed in the gay costume of
 the cavalier she could not determine
 at that distance and in the dim light
 how he looked the bell tingled the
 orchestra struck up the opening eight
 bars and she tapped the floor with the
 toe of her shoe the stage was flooded
 with light the curtain went up and she
 started on keeping step with the ca-
 valier coming from the opposite direc-
 tion

    the action of the play demanded that
 she should not look up until within a
 pace of the cavalier and that then she
 should utter a startled cry of love and
 surprise but she had great difficulty in
 adhering to this course twice as she
 walked toward the center of the stage
 she tried to glance up through her eye-
 lashes at the approaching author-actor
 but could see no higher than his chin

   when she came within a step of him
 she stopped looked up gave a gasp of
 genuine surprise and joy and fell into
 the outstretched arms of-butler the
 spotlight man

   when the performance was over
 mason and all the other members of the
 company assured elsie that she had
 never played so well with such bril-
 liancy and life and buoyancy that she
 had never seemed so thoroughly carried
 away by love for her art

   but an hour later after the author
 had explained for the tenth time that
 lie had taken the position of spotlight
 man in order to study the technique of
 the stage-so that he could write a play
 especially for her she admitted smiling
 through her tears that her good work
 had not been due entirely to love for
 her art alone

   mason was the best man-with a
 grin
myjfort successful pay

  henry biooiil

it is difficult sometimes for a play-
wright to decide just which is his
best production for the reason that
so many things enter into the equa-
tion that he has to think for a while
before making up his mind the box-
office is considered the best judge of
course and yet many authors have
felt that their most deserving efforts
have not had justice at that supreme
and final court however in my case
i would not dispute its decision and

quite agree that mile modiste is
the best stage product of which i
have so far been guilty as author

  it was written five years ago and
followed checkers and the yan-
kee consul at that time i was liv-
ing in a little bachelor apartment on
thirtieth street new york city the
play and the musical comedy just
mentioned had both been very suc-
cessful and it was only natural that
something else should follow the




the green book album

playwright who succeeds in one ef-
fort does not have to go about look-
ing for managers they come to him
and so it was in my case one day i
received a call from mr charles dil-
lingham who asked if i would write
the book and lyrics for another mu-
sical comedy he told me that mad-
am fritzi scheff was under con-
tract to him and that he wanted a
starring vehicle for her i agreed to
do the work and after talking the
matter over with mr dillingham and
madam scheff we decided to take a
trip to europe together for the pur-
pose of gathering the right material
and putting it in shape in circum-
stances that would make it agreeable
to all madam scheff wanted the
scenes laid in paris as she preferred
the modern atmosphere and gowns
and so to paris we went

  in the meantime i had outlined the
plot in my mind and as we traveled
about i began to fill it in the situa-
tion by the way in which the poor
working girl is loved by the man of
rank and wealth is always a good
one for the stage particularly when
the man of high degree in the end
has to get down on his knees and be-
seech the girl to marry him it never
fails to get the gallery and of course
if you can get them youve got the
house in mile modiste this idea
was used and it proved a very suc-
cessful situation at that time mad-
am scheff did not speak english
very fluently and i had to use lan-
guage to which her vocabulary was
suited this is very evident in the
manuscript where the words and
also the sentences are noticeably
short i wrote the lines as we went
along and after i had finished a bit of
dialogue or a verse meant for her
would submit it to her to read  and if
there was anything in it that she did
not like or to which her articulation
was not equal it was cut out or
changed in that way the greater

part of the book was written while
we were in paris the balance-with
the lyrics-was finished at saratoga
where i went to collaborate with
victor herbert on the musical num-
bers

  i do not wish to give the impres-
sion that all of my dramatic efforts
have been as easily placed as was
mile modiste checkers my first
attempt at stage work was not in
that class it was written while i was
in my fathers insurance office in st
louis and afterward when i began
the business of trying to interest a
manager in it i hawked it around
broadway for three years before find-
ing one who was willing to give it a
trial then this manager wanted to
put an actor in the title role who was
under contract to him but as i did
not think he was the right one for the
part i refused the offer i remember
telling george broadhurst about it at
the time whats the matter with
you said he are you crazy do
you mean to tell me that you have re-
fused an offer to have your play pro-
duced whats the use i argued
if it will only be a failure better
far have no production then i
went back to the business of ped-
dling it again until it got to be a joke
in the lambs club whenever i went
in they would laugh and say
heres blossom with checkers un-
der his arm as usual but the wait-
ing was not in vain for when kirk
lashelle finally did produce the play
it was an instantaneous success

 then came the yankee consul
that by the way was not the orig-
inal name i had intended the hero to
be a big bluff manly naval officer
who went about everywhere setting
things straight and i had named it
the lieutenant commander but
when mr savage saw it he said he
wanted it for a starring vehicle for
raymond hitchcock and that the
part of the consul which at that time
my most successful play



was a secondary part was the one in
which he wanted him to appear and
asked if i could build it up so as to
make it the principal role this was
done and the name changed from
the lieutenant commander to
the yankee consul i had got the
idea in the first place from looking
through a rand mcnally guide-
book i was after some location re-
mote and different in atmosphere
from any that had hitherto been used
in comic opera and finally hit on
hayti then i remembered that the
inhabitants there were colored and
knew that wouldnt do so i looked a
little further and found san do-
mingo that had a spanish ring and
so it was decided on the choice
proved a good one for the yankee
consul was successful and is still
playing

 this is aside from the subject of
my best play but it has to do with
the process of building a comic opera
and is an instance of the changes that
are made before it reaches the pub-
lic the writer of musical comedy has
anything but his own way in the con-
struction of the piece and for that
reason it is the most unsatisfactory
kind of effort personally i have
been very fortunate-not having had
any failures but at that the work is
disappointing for the reason that so
many practical things necessary to
the production interfere with the au-
thors preferred idea of the book in
the first place everyone concerned
with the piece has something to do
with its construction possibly the
manager likes it and says he will
produce it but he has a few stipula-
tions  he wants the second act laid in
palm beach instead of the north
pole as you had originally written it
because he has an expensive setting
of palm beach left over from some-
thing that has just failed and he
wants to use it instead of buying
new then possibly he will say to

you now i have engaged so and
so because he does a wonderfully
funny fall that always makes a hit
with the audience and i want him in
the piece it may be that so and
bo can neither act nor sing but just
the same you have got to put in
something for him to do and so it
goes there may be others on the
managers pay-roll who must be
looked after he has contracts with
them and must supply them with
something to do and it is only nat-
ural of course that he should expect
your vehicle to cover their wants as
much as possible and so it is neces-
sary to make it over to suit their
various specialties and requirements

  then after you have rearranged
the book to suit all the stipulated re-
quirements the time comes for re-
hearsal after having made so many
changes you feel that you would like
to have the piece appear as you had
finally got it together and you have
hopes not for long though the
manager is sitting down in front the
book in hand suddenly he decides
that the pages between eight and
eighteen must be cut out the author
attempts to protest but it is of no
use the manager doesnt even stop
to use a pencil wheres a pin-give
me a pin he cries there and be-
fore you have time to mention your
contract ten pages of your book have
gone to oblivion the leaves are
pinned together-cut-and thats
an end to them its of no use to pro-
test of course you can take your
manuscript and go home but then
you dont you remember that you
have spent six months of your time
on the piece and that after all the ob-
ject is to see it on the stage and so
you let it go as the manager wants
it then there is the stage manager
and the leading woman possibly
they will not like your favorite
verses and whats the answer they
are cut out finally you come to the


the green book album

opening night the leading woman
is thinking of her voice the stage
manager is wondering if his choruses
are going to work properly and well
maybe the composer is in the house
and then the orchestra puts on
double steam and the lines are the
last things that get any attention so
i say the making of a musical com-
edy is both complex and heart-break-
ing for the librettist and the best he
gets is the worst of it

  the writing of mile modiste
took about six months time i usual-
ly write the book which takes about
three months and leave holes for the
lyrics that allows three months for
the verses the lyrics are usually
written before the music though this
is not always the case sometimes
mr herbert will say i have a little
air that i think a good deal of and
would like to have you work it in
somewhere if you can and then i
go ahead and write the jingles to it
some of my most successful songs
have been written in this way

  mile modiste was written first in
pencil as that is the way all of my
writing is done and after comple-
tion in this way it was dictated to
a stenographer i do not make out a
regular scenario but have a play
clearly mapped out in my mind be-
fore beginning to write once i neg-
lected to do this and the result is
that the play has never been finished

  apropos of the disappointments
that a librettist has in seeing his
work produced one very important
point was not mentioned it is this

those who take part successfully in
musical comedy must be unusually
accomplished-they must be able to
sing dance and act to find all of this
ability well developed in one person
is of course expecting a good deal
and those who are so fortunately pos-
sessed command such high salaries
that if the entire cast of a musical
comedy were of this class the cost
would be prohibitive however i am
not complaining as i have been un-
usually fortunate in the interpreters
of my work

  mile modiste played to capacity
for more than two years at the
knickerbocker theatre in new york
and is still playing on the road an
elaborate production of it is to be
made in london this fall by mr f
c whitney who has had such a great
success there with the chocolate
soldier it is his purpose also to
produce the red mill later in
london this piece by the way was
the second musical play that i wrote
for mr dillingham in collaboration
with victor herbert and i had been
near to naming it as my most suc-
cessful work for with the able aid of
montgomery  stone it was a tre-
mendous hit from every standpoint
-popular artistic financial but
mile modiste-well if i am to be
remembered by just one libretto let
it be that
stern the manager of the show
suddenly grew tired of leaning up
against the iron railing around the
entrance to the auditorium wallace
stern was only a little man yet that
iron railing swayed and trembled under
the weight of his ninety pounds for
five minutes more he sat on the long
tin box where the tickets of the incom-
ing audience were deposited providing
there were any audience or tickets but
he soon tired of that too and shuffled
along the cheap dusty imitation marble
floor starred with tobacco juice

  extremely restless seemed the afore-
said wallace stern manager advance-
agent press representative and more
often than not ticket-taker for the
darton repertoire company he
leaned now against the door jamb
looking out into the night

  out of the semi-blackness a lurid
red glow shone far ahead of him ac-
companied by the far away buzz of
voices the muffled beating of drums
and the blare of brass instruments

  humph he growled just like old

richards to book us here in opposition
to a county fair we get prescott
canada on washingtons birthday and
orangeburg south carolina on lin-
colns where do we get off

  he continued to stare towards the of-
fending fair grounds in question his
parchment-like face seared with many
lines drawn into no pleasant expres-
sion footsteps along the board side-
walk had made him think that some-
body had nerve enough to come to the
show when those footsteps developed
into a trimly built exaggeratedly
dressed woman she jumped at sight of
him and called out of breath

  oh lord wally you scared me
stiff standing there like that

  how so milly stern grunted
dont i alius stand like this in front o
the house gee by the look of it   be
the only one standing take it from
me 

  no she answered vaguely you
looked like you did that other time
stern jumped as though he had seen
a ghost




the green book album

  gee milly he whispered i was
thinkin o him all day he looked up
and down the dark street although he
knew there was not a soul there-
looked as if he feared some shadow
would take on human form and spring
out at him how long is it milly

  a year to-day wally-yes an it was
near here too

  there was a long pause while nothing
was heard but their own deep breathing
and the far away drums voices and
blares of brass with a weird sputter
the arc lamp over their heads burst into
light each was frightened by the sight
of the others face another pause
then

  so long wally-i gotta make up

  so long milly-see you after the

show

  she smiled at him turned the corner
of the brick building and was gone

  stern thrust his hands deep into his
trousers pockets jingling the twenty-
seven cents therein that smile of
millys made it seem like that many dol-
lars heigho there were many smiles
like that for him-but no more

  he kicked a shoe heel with the toe of
the other

  gee he murmured half aloud
its funny im thinking of her old man
all day an she should be too a year to-
day-how i wish somethin would turn
up

  something did-but not what mr
stern had reference to a long-armed
rube with his sally on his arm
sidled up to the box-office and purchased
two orchestra seats-for thirty cents
in his wake came two more pleasure-
seeking farm hands and it was not long
before wallace stern was mechanically
takin tickets before the afore-men-
tioned iron railing and thrusting them
into the aforesaid long tin box

  but his mind was far from his task

  try as he might the thought process
always reverted to that night a year
ago when the husband of mildred kim-
ball went out of sight of all mankind-
or all that was theatrical of mankind
where was he was he dead was he
crazed  surely no man could very well
withstand such a shock without it af-
fecting him no one had heard of him-

no one had seen him a year ago to-
day  wasnt there some law that after
a husband had been gone for a year the
wife could divorce him was there-or
had he dreamed it he-by gad-he
would marry milly kimball to-morrow
-to-night if shed so much as give him
a hint why-but there was work now

  two blanketed indians with flannel
shirts and trousers underneath were
standing impressively before him one
held out a greasy grimy hand palm up-
ward

  lord remarked stern to himself
i thought they were wooden i was
looking for the cigar store ninety-
pound mr stern must be indeed rattled
to lose his sense of humor aloud now
to the staring grim-visaged aboriginal
whats the matter chief-what
dye want

  the indian drew himself to his full
height pulled his blanket closer and
answered with much dignity

  give money-show heap rotten
the other copper-faced fellow nod-
ded his head

  looka here chief said stern au-
thoritatively you havent seen all of
it theres shootin in the next act go
on in and sit down

  the indians grunted and drew down
their mouth corners but allowed stem
to push them back through the door
he knew very well there was to be no
shooting to delight them still sixty
cents was-sixty cents these troublous
times

  stern looked long at the stage the
curtain was up and milly had just
made her entrance he thought she
looked swell in her lavender dress al-
though he had seen her make it and
knew it to be made of paper muslin and
second-hand chiffon still her lady isa-
bel was ideal to him he had seen many
-east lynne had followed him far
and wide-he had seen this one thou-
sands of times it is doubtful if the au-
thor of the play knew it half so well as
he did yet he stood there watching this
one for the thousandth and first time
his thin little hand holding the door be-
hind him half open his ideal lady isa-
bel-yea his ideal woman

  when the first act was almost over
kimballs come back

he turned about to go into the box-
otnce business was business and though
he knew the receipts would be meager
enough they must be counted and a
statement sent in

  he had gone but half way across the
floor of the dirty lobby when his hand
came to his throat and a horrible in-
take of his breath went quivering
through his parched lips

  for there in the flickering sput-
tering light of the arc lamp a puzzled
expression on his face he stood-milly
kimballs husband

  for fully two minutes they stood
staring at each other the little man-
agers face still expressing infinite ter-
ror the other mans eyes were still
puzzled then he tilted back a battered
slouch hat the manager saw his hair
was white a new thing in that year
the man smiled

  hello stern he said in a far away
voice am i in time

  as if it worked on a rusty hinge
sterns head went up and down nod-
ding assent the man turned the corner
of the brick building and was gone in
the darkness beyond

  for a moment wallace stern stood
there in the identical position he had
assumed on seeing kimball then like
a stopped machine that has suddenly
been set agoing with double power he
darted by the wall and down the long
dim alley

  kimball had just reached the stage
door it had hardly banged behind him
when stem opened it again and was on
the stage

  they were setting the stage for the
second act there was the usual raucous
shouting swearing and bustle the usual
swirling of dust clouds

  kimball was standing by the switch-
board sniffing stern saw him smile
again turn and mount the rickety
wooden stairs on stealthy feet stern
followed him the man turned to the
right pushed open a door and went in-
to the dressing-room

  for a moment the little manager hesi-
tated again quickly swallowing the
lump that swelled to his throat he
opened the door

  if it were possible the face pf the



actor in the chair was almost the coun-
terpart of sterns in wild-eyed terror
me was gazing open-eyed at kimball-
who m a business-like manner was
taking off coat waistcoat collar and tie

    rn caught the actors eve and
motioned him outside

   there on the landingthey whispered
my god stern is it jimmy kim-
ball or his ghost

  i dunno-search me-i dunno
  whats he goin to do

  i dunno

  the actor peeked through the crack
in the door

  say stern he whispered turning
again to the little manager what dye
think hes makin up

  let him alone-thats all stern
answered thickly let him alone
but see here old man the actor
whined i gotta change for this next
act-what-

  borrow somebody elses stuff
stern replied whatll she say let im
alone i tell yer or youll queer it
poor little stone had to hold on to
the balustrade on his way down the
stairs they swayed beneath him as if
he were drunk he kept on though till
he came to a door with a rude star
daubed on it with a trembling hand he
knocked

  who is it came millys voice
im hookin up my dress

   its-its ony me

  stern was frightened by the sound
of his own voice

  a few agonizing moments and milly
kimball opened the door she was
smiling as she did so but the sight of
stems face changed her expression
the little manager came trembling into
the dingy draughty room closing the
door after him without the prelimina-
ries of either removing his hat or sit-
ting down he croaked hoarsely

   hes here i

  there was no need for explanation
that hes here was fraught with
every emotion the pent up soul of the
little manager was capable of the
make-up on milly kimball s face hid
the sudden whiteness that came there

  when did he come  she asked with
terrible calmness


the green book album

  bout fifteen minutes ago replied

 stern

 whats lie doin  

 makin-up

 where 

 up n tommys room

 the orchestra was already playing
 the strain that she knew took up the
 curtain she caught hold of stern by
 the arm and whispered

 find out what hes makin up for--
 keep him in the dressin room wally

 the trouble with most people wal-
 lace stern found was that they didnt
 realize how hard was the task they
 were imposing on him it was one thing
 to wait in the cold bleak station to
 make sleeper arrangements another to
 beat down a landlord two dollars a day
 on a hotel bill but this-to help a man
 that had come as if from the tomb to
 rob him of all he held dearest

 but he did it

 he didnt remember how yet it was
 done somehow one thing that puzzled
 him was kimballs answer to one of
 his questions the question was
 whereve you been keepin yerself
 jim to which the returned kimball
 had replied where-why i left you
 this afternoon at the station

 so that was it-the whole year was
 a blank and jim kimball thought the
 whole thing was taking place this day
 a year back

 after the next act he told this to
 milly she seemed to ignore it or as if
 she already knew it and asked

 whats he makin up for wally
 answer me that

 it looks like monseer duval t me
 she caught her lip in her finger a
 moment then glanced up at him quick-
 ly saying

 what scene was it wally

 i dont get you milly he answered
 vaguely

 dont stand there starin at me she
 went on with a stamp of her foot
 what scene was it

 what scene when

 when it happened

 i-i-dunno milly

 she caught him by both shoulders
 and shook him

  tell me the scene she almost
screamed tell me the scene

  the one in the second act he man-
aged to blurt out at last the big one
tween you an him

  all right-set the stage for it
now gee milly theres an act o
this to run yet

  but after you bonehead-you can
set it after cant you 

  as usual wallace stern complied
he spent the remainder of that act
keeping a puzzled kimball in his dress-
ing-room and bribing unwilling stage
hands to stay another half hour and
set like all else that wras disagreeable
to him he did it

  the last rube had filed out
through the iron railing the orchestra
had blared out the exit march and had
begun now to pack up their instru-
ments the last curtain had fallen and
the front doors banged shut yet slow-
ly that curtain rose again revealing an
interior set with a woman seated on
a cheap divan that woman was milly
kimball

  she read a few lines and then there
stalked upon the stage a tall man in a
frock coat high hat and complete
afternoon dress he wore the conven-
tional sideboards and glasses of the
road monsieur duval his manner
though nervous was impressive

  then followed as strange a scene as
has ever been played within the walls
of a theatre there was the woman
reading her lines while her soul was in
a turmoil for she knew she was fight-
ing for the return of a mans memory
the man was fighting for that mem-
or too though he knew it not and
the single auditor torn by love on one
side by duty and former friendship
on the other-poor little wallace stern

  suddenly kimball stopped dead his
wife was watching him and stem saw
she was trembling this was the cru-
cial test then kimball threw out his
anus and cried out

  tell them to play the orchestra-
dont crowd gentlemen-women and
children first god-the smoke get her
out stern dont mind me-look out
for milly

  he stopped again what thoughts
kimballs come back

must have run riot through the brain
of a little man and a woman  kimball
looked at his wife then with an ani-
mal-like cry he rushed over and caught
her in his arms

  wallace stern manager advance-
agent press representative and more
often than not ticket-taker for the
darton repertoire company did not
stay long watching that sobbing laugh-
ing hysterical pair all he knew was
that there had been a fire in a theatre
and everyone had been saved but jim



kimball where kimball had been
what he had done didnt matter
through this simple ruse he had re-
gained both memory and identity-aye
and the wife who feared he was dead
all that was a year ago now they
were together again while he-

  he knew what he wallace stern
had to do there was the scenery to be
put aboard the car and danny the car-
penter was sick he was only a little
man but he had to help

  and he did it

my fat friend gets a bad attack of foot-light
tis after seeing a fortune teller

his fat face aglow with the royal
flush that comes from contact
with a good stiff wind gabby
blew into my office it was just after
the big snow fall i make mention of the
snow because my pleated-bosom friend
brought in with him considerable of the
chocolate mixture that parades as beau-
tiful snow along the principal thorough-
fares in new york gabby brought it in
with him clinging to his shoes he pro-
ceeded to spread the mixture of mud
and snow over our nice green rug
stamping his trilbies with great vigor
he unwrapped a thick near-wool muf-
fler from around his alabaster throat
divested himself of the horse blanket
called by courtesy an overcoat and
waved me a good morning

  the ease and nonchalance with which

my heavy-weight friend takes possession
of a place or assumes full charge of a
conversation are two of the things that
certainly get upon my nerves but after
an effort i stifled my inclination to
bounce a book off his head and asked

  where have you been the last cou-
ple of weeks mr boob

  i was over in philadelphia learning
to play draw poker in the art school
he retorted flippantly say nix on that
ancient comedy about the quaker vil-
lage being anchored to the delaware
river it is one fussy little burg and
dont you go to sleep thinking the streets
will be covered with moss when you
awaken

  you said the same sort of thing aft-
er you came back from cohoes i re-
minded gabby as nearly as i can


gabby goes on tile stage



figure out your system it amounts to
just this if some come-on falls for an
invitation to have you spend a week or
 in his company you think the place
he lives in is a sort of earthly paradise
youre a sure thing guy you are
slow up steve exclaimed gabby
i didnt honor you with a call to have
you give me an illustrated lecture on my
personal weaknesses

  youve been talking so fast and say-
ing- so much that ive almost forgotten
what i blew in to tell you

  then you have something to say
sure i have i came in to tip you oft
to the big tidings

  i suppose you have got in dutch
with the cops again

  oh no fair friend nothing so harsh
as that but youll never guess what is
going to happen

  all right spill the beans i suggest-
ed what is it i suppose some one
died and left you a bunch of cigar cou-
pons

  gabby looked at me for half a min-
ute then

  i went and had my fortune told
you went and did what i de-
manded

  had my fortune told he replied
calmly puffing away

  well mr mutton i always did
think your mainspring was on the bias
now im sure of it you must be going
dips so old lumber top had his cute
little fortune told did he

  yes snapped gabby but if you
think youre going to make a hippo-
drome out of this theres no good rea-
son for me telling you anything about
it

  oh go on and recite your piece
i might as well hear the rest of your
harrowing tale and i forthwith set-
tled back in my chair

  coming back from philadelphia a
couple of days ago he began i un-
wrapped fifty centimes extra for the
privilege of resting my feet on the cush-
ions in the palace car with the rest of
the bloated bondholders

  certainly is some class to you little
one i murmured

  the coupon they slipped me called
for chair number twelve i rolled aboard

the luxury wagon and permitted the
sunburned gent to slap my benny and
bonnet in the gilt rack and then planted
myself m the plush seat

  you were acting almost like a hu-
man being i suggested

  he went on

  we were beginning to hit only the
high places before i got my bearings
and began taking a squint around
trying to do a little flirting

  no nothing like that i just wanted
to get a line on the sort of mob that
was stabled in the car with me in the
chair next to me i piped a queen

  a good looker eh i suppose you
are going to tell me you made a play
for her and just as things were begin-
ning to look real chummy her husband
blew in from the smoker and bounced
a suit-case off your dome

  nix there wasnt no husband she
was a nice friendly dame and before
we had gone very many miles we were
buzzing together just as though i had
been raised in the same family as
her she was some dainty pippin
sighed gabby

  well what are you going to tell
me  did you take her to dinner and find
out that you didnt have the price of the
pork and beans with you and had to
leave your waterbury to make good on
the food check

  no but after we had been chatter-
ing for about fifteen minutes i dis-
covered she was a fortune teller

  ah the plot thickens i suppose
she was ducking the phillie cops and
was hunting a new tent for her talent
and skill on manhattan isle

  for heavens sake clamp down
your lever throw off the gears and
give me a listen will you this dame
was some class she was clever she
told my fortune down to a dot she
told me i should go on the stage

  what i demanded incredulously
go on the stage you

  this was too much for me i let out
a yell that must have been heard a
block away i had never m my wildest
imaginings pictured my old trouble-
fiuder as a budding hamlet it seemed

too foolish	 rf-omw

  yep sturdily persisted uabd


the greek book album

she said the lines in my hand clearly
indicated i would be a great success as
an actor in fact she said she couldnt
believe that i wasnt already on and
that she thought i was some famous
comedian whose name she couldnt
remember

  and you believed all this

  and why not im human aint i
i dont see that these other guys behind
the footlights have any more right than
i have to believe they can act

  and so youre going to be a little
actor 

  thats the ticket and thats the rea-
son i came down here to see you
where am  supposed to come in
i want you to help me get started
he replied you know a whole raft of
these vaudeville agents i am rehearsing
my act now and all youll have to do
will be to get me a date at one of the
small houses to break the act in it will
be easy sailing after that and then we
can go out and grab the big time

  are you completely nuts it seems
to me your brains must be leaking away
by the minute but just the same i was
beginning to realize that the stout per-
son was evidently very much in earnest

  ive had a go at about everything
else now i might as well have a ses-
sion at elevating the drammer and he
smiled broadly

  all right gabby i said if youve

really got your mind made up ill help
you get off to a fast start what man-
ner of dazzling exhibition do you pro-
pose giving a tight-rope walking act
an exhibition of the black art or bari-
tone selections from grand opera
youre kidding yourself now
grunted gabby im going to do noth-
ing more or less than a single talking
and singing act to run about twelve
minutes-and believe me pal it is going
to be some act even if i do say so my-
self as shouldnt

  i see you are going to tell comical
stories that will make the audience fall
out of their seats i dare say it will be
a riot well if youre in earnest ill
run over and see joe mcmasters he
books a flock of these small time dumps
and i guess hell be able to fix you up
when will you be ready to go on
im about ready now but wed bet-
ter start off on a monday lets see
this is wednesday isnt it well then
suppose e say next monday

  right you are actor i replied
smilingly and im to tell joe that you
will do twelve minutes of song and
story am i right

  yep thats the dope tell him too
that ive got a monologue that will have
them cheering for more and as for
songs why ive got a couple-well
theres absolutely nothing to it-every
one of them is a sure-fire hit

  you talk like a vaudeville guy al-
ready i remarked as i arose put on
my overcoat and hat and made a bee
line for joe mcmasters office

  the upshot of my visit was that joe
readily agreed with me that the best
way in which to cure gabby was to
let him try himself out before an audi-
ence if he made good all right if not
then curtain

  often i have sat in a theatre and wit-
nessed the humiliation of some trusting
amateur aspirant endeavoring to con-
vince an audience of wisenheimers
that he was the real all-wool-and-a-
yard-wide comical cuss however i de-
termined to wait until young beefo
had had a chance to show what he
could do before deciding whether i
must order a mourning band to wear on
my arm you know there are some
gabbx goes on the stage	

mighty strange tilings happen in the
show world not the least strange are
the accidental and unexpected hits made
by ginks who have been pre-judged
dubs without a chance to get by

  joe arranged a three day tryout for
gabby at the arctic music hall this
giggle temple was formerly an iron
foundry but by indulging in a wild
campaign of plaster cast and staff work
the lessees managed to convert it into
a veritable palace of aladdin

  during the remaining days of prepa-
ration gabby had little to say on the
big monday i met him he was calm-
ness personified his own confidence
began working on me and i found my-
self wondering whether at that lie
might not have a good act and surprise
us all but my better judgment told
me that it was only his own superlative
gall and egotism that was holding him
up gabby is certainly the original car-
amel when it simmers down to a ques-
tion of self-esteem

  on the stage managers copy gabby
was down to go on in the number three
position i had an early lunch and
started up the white alley to the arctic
music hall i walked around the lobby
glancing casually over the pictures
plastered about i took a good long look
at the frame wherein reposed the ro-
tund and affable map of my adventur-
ous pal he seemed to look out of the
frame with a glance that said as plain
as anything could be watch me kid 
im a bear

  they had billed gabby something
after this style

first appearance
of

the real gabby
presenting a clever conceit
of mirth and melody

broadways beau brummel
engaged
at a gigantic salary

  ill bet gabby wrote that billing
himself i murmured to myself as
i dug and prepared to separate myself
from the ten pennies required to gain
legal admittance

  if there is one particular thing in life
that i confess to liking it is moving

pictures i sure do dote on fighting the
films and watching the shadow dramas
there is a sense of relief in knowing
that the actors in the various picture
plays are not going to assail your ears
with bad diction muffled enunciation
to say nothing to up-stage conversa-
tion that is rarely to be heard and
when it is heard is never to be under-
stood

  the only serious drawback to per-
fect enjoyment at a picture show is to
be found in the presence of the persist-
ent and inevitable musician he or she
is usually a ragtime pianist who in-
sists upon accompanying each picture
as it is shown on the screen with a
selected selection

  now this arrangement probably
would be ok were it not that the
piano-teasing genius as often as not
fails to fit the music to the picture it
is a common occurrence to hear men-
delssohns spring song badly macer-
ated as the ever-willing keyboard-me-
chanic pounds it out as his or her idea
of a proper musical motif for a rough
and tumtjle comedy scene in which a
film actor falls head first into a barrel
of flour or better still or worse as
you may decide an inspiring march
tune is the ultimate word as the friend
and companion of a picture depicting
a group of people waltzing such de-
tails of treatment may be unique but
they certainly are disconcerting out-


the green book album

side of such minor matters however
the music that goes with moving pic-
tures is generally all right

  once inside the tent of fun i set-
tled myself to await the coming of the
noblest roman of them all

  first on the program was mile
muffler a soubrette of good intentions
but faulty execution she just managed
to get off the stage without inciting
the gathering to a display of violence
following mile muffler came the re-
nowned professor dogwalk introduc-
ing ilis group of siberian musk oxen
there wasnt much class to the siberian
musk cows and they left unhonored
and unsung after the cows had dis-
appeared the management tossed off
a batch of pictures that pleased the
fancy of the multitude

  number three this magic numeral
was put on the card by the budding
back president who was acting as card
boy the piano-pounder played a late
song over about a dozen times but
there was no indication that gabby was
about to burst into view i began to
wonder if the stout youth had lost his
nerve and had backed out i didnt like
to permit myself to think that he had
been suddenly seized with a mad desire
to see the old folks away down south
in the state of maine and had grabbed
the first train out

  as a matter of fact very unwillingly
i was beginning to feel rather uncom-
fortable and nervous about the welfare
of the mastodon the audience like-
wise even though they did not enjoy
the advantage of personal acquaintance
with my pal were beginning to give
indications of dissatisfaction feet were
beginning to pound the floor in heavy-
soled monotonous rhythm audible re-
quests that the management produce
the goods came from various quarters
of the house and there was a distinctly
restless feeling that all was not well
with number three

  just when it was beginning to look
as though there would be a small sized
riot unless something happened and
happened quickly the genial stage
manager mr luke tureen walked
on the stage luke raised his hand
for silence when the rumbling and

chatter had died down sufficiently to
permit his being heard he addressed
the assembled boobs including the one
who is penning these immortal lines

  ladies and gentlemen i am goin
to ast you to be patient fer a minute or
two mr gabby who is number tree
on this all-star program will positively
appear the delay was caused owin to
him havin had a accident owin to his
galluses or i should say his suspenders
breakin down just as he wuz about to
come on however the stage crew is
helpin him out by tyin up his trousers
with a piece of rope thankin you one
and all fer your kind attention i re-
main

  and with this masterly finish to his
oration luke bowed himself off as
gracefully as a steam roller taking a
sharp curve on a slippery street he
managed to hit the edge of the prosce-
nium cn route but did manage to dis-
appear from view before anything seri-
ous happened

  the tiano lammer once more trailed
off into gabbys opening number then
presto our sterling athlete became
visible to the naked eye

  the fact that his trousers had tem-
porarily suspended doing their regula-
tion stunt earned for him a demonstra-
tion of approval and applause that fair-
ly lived up to the regulation stock
phrase of raising the rafters

  as we have discussed gabbys gen-
eral personal demeanor at length on
other occasions it is hardly necessary
that we go into details at this time let
it suffice to say that modest is not gab-
bys middle name he does not believe
that you can paint the lily or that any-
one has anything on him he is a strik-
ing specimen of the genus ego and is
always willing and ready to stand or
fall of himself

  but notwithstanding all this it did
not require the services of an expert
to be able to detect that our hearty
eater was flabbergasted for once that
easy confidence had gone a-glimmering
he stood elephantine in the center of
the stage shifting his feet and aimlessly
flapping his pudgy arms his chubby
face had lost its usual human expres-
sion and turned a dull pea green as
gabby goes on the stage

could be seen with half an eye even
through the mass of make-up and as
we are on the subject permit us to
direct attention to this make-up

  as iii everything else gabby refuses
to acknowledge that even the inventor
of the process for applying grease paint
could show him anything along those
lines and as a result of this buoyant
confidence he had succeeded in so dis-
figuring his face that even i had diffi-
culty in recognizing him in his new
disguise but in spite of the fact that
he was disguised-and believe me it
was a disguise-gabby had turned pea
green

  the gentlemanly anvil expert who
was acting as pianist kept repeating
the opening bars of gabbys first song
he played it for perhaps a full minute
before the noise of gabbys reception
died down and our plunging vaude-
villian had an opportunity to show
his gait

  finally however things did quiet
down and the operator of the ivories
gave gabby his cue to break into song
it would be far better and more char-
itable could we draw the veil of sym-
pathetic obscurity over what followed
but jealous of our reputation as an
accurate and truth-telling chronicler
we must proceed to dip deep the foun-
tain pen and set down all that came
forth on that day

  during your lifetime you have prob-
ably noticed the manner of a child
about to enter a room to have a session
with a stern parent and a strap if you
have then you know just how gabby
appeared at this momentous crisis in
his career and undoubtedly he felt the
same way

  i have said that the piano man gave
gabby the cue to break into song he
did and gathering himself together
with a superhuman effort the man
whale opened the generous aperture
in his rotund face and emitted certain
sounds i cannot say truthfully that he
started in to sing no gentle reader
he merely emitted sounds

  for about six bars he was two or
three notes behind the pianist and about
five tones flat then through one of
those lucky accidents that sometimes



iespas the re b resulated of fami-
nes as the grouch remarked when his

      t u mistook the tabasco for
at ketclp gabbys vocal appa-
ratus managed to harmonize with the
strmgs of the piano and he hit the right

           av tsolg was entitled dont
fv r	ad of reat physic-

al effort mental strain and tonal riot

he managed to wade through three
verses and choruses without a violent
assault being committed upon his
person

  in fact not only did he manage to
get through without damage but a small
and select group of people in the audi-
ence possessing more than the average
sense of humor applauded this in-
jected sufficient nerve and backbone in-
to the budding monologist to permit him
to start off on his spiel

  rubbing his freshly laundered vest
and depositing nice stripes of pink face
coloring along the line of his expansive
bay window gabby stepped forward
and addressed the multitude

  ladies and gentlemen i am going
to tell you a couple of little stories i
hope you like them if you do that will
be nice if you dont then it wont be
nice one tuesday afternoon a chicken
was walking down broadway it was a
bright sunshiny sort of afternoon the
chicken hadnt had a nibble of com
since the day before she was mighty
hungry but lacked the price of a bag
of corn suddenly she saw one of the
nicest roosters of her acquaintance beat-
ing it down on the other side of the
street did she cross the road  she did
for why to get on the other side
not on your life she crossed over to
make a little speech to the prize corn
merchant and probably grab oft a tree
lunch simple isnt it

  this story was about as bad a tlung
as i have ever listened to  the stage
likewise the audience who had paid
their collective tolls in order to be
counted among those present reiusec
to get cheerful not only did they re-
frain from any indications of encour-
agement but they decidedly and unmis-
takably showed that in ther opmon t
was very poor stuft there was not as
much as a chirp of applause some of


the green book album

the audience grunted a few booed and
a big bunch of them snorted dismally

  gabby who had thought out this
dainty little story all by his lonesome
was somewhat abashed at the lack of
appreciation he gave every evidence
of becoming panic stricken he did not
know whether to grin or to close up
his features until a later date he shuf-
fled uneasily from one ponderous foot
to another he sucked in his dry lips
and then stuck them out then he
blinked his owl-like eyes rubbed his
fat digits nervously against his hips
and gave other and sundry unmistak-
able evidences that he was all at sea
and that his goat was on a rampage

  all this that we have just referred
to so feelingly took place within a few
seconds to gabby it must have seemed
like an eon

  one young and hopeful citizen in
the audience delivered the following
helpful suggestion which tended to put
gabby at his ease

  aw come on in out of the snow or
youll be caught in a drift

  this tactful hint coming as it did
just when the knees of our gladiator
were threatening to give way under the
strain acted like a tonic he came out
of his trance disregarding the wave of
merriment that was sweeping over the
audience following the snowdrift ad-
vice he pulled himself together

  advancing to the footlights he gazed
sternly at the mob in front and held
up his hand as if to command attention
he then proceeded to give expression
to a bit of speechifying as far as i
could get what he was saving having a
due regard for the fact that it was al-
most impossible to hear what he was
driving at gabbys remarks were some-
what along these lines

  just a moment ladies and gentle-
men your well meant and thoroughly
appreciated demonstration reminds me
of another story i heard a few days
ago and then and there and not-
withstanding the fact that he must have
called upon all his reserve stock of
nervo he recited the following anec-
dote which the audience stunned into
silence by his sublime brass accepted
in a spirit of helplessness

  an old irishman whom we will call
patrick was delighted one morning
recently when his wife norah pre-
sented him with a baby daughter noth-
ing would do patrick hut that he must
rush around and see his spiritual ad-
viser a charming man with a sense of
humor this is aout the conversation
that ensued between patrick and the
churchman said patrick

   good morning your grace ive
got a favor to ask of you

   and what is the favor patrick

   weve got a new baby girl around
at the house and i was thinking as how
id like to have you christen her

    ill he delighted to do so patrick
and what were you thinking of calling
her 

   well we were thinking wed call
her hazel

  the churchman looked at patrick
for a -yinute in silence then spoke
hazel is it sure and with the
names of all the saints to select from
why do you go and pick out the name of
a nut  

  this story really got a laugh and lots
of applause i verily believe that if gab-
by had been satisfied to exit on this
story he would have gotten away with
his act and there would have been
no necessity for our recording this
gloom history but with his usual tact
and skill he decided that inasmuch as
this one had gone so well he would try
another song

  boldly almost defiantly he an-
nounced he would favor us with that
screamingly funny song i care not
who makes the dough boys its bis-
cuits for mine

   if his first number was a tragedy this
one was a massacre he had hardly be-
gun when he pulled up short the poor
deluded nut had forgotten the words of
the song flushed with his success in
the story-telling line he had dashed
into the song without knowing it for
the life of him he could not recall the
lyric he spluttered stuttered stumbled
choked gagged coughed and inhaled
like the exhaust on a steam engine all
in vain he could not produce anything
in the way of a melody

  it was evident he was through fin-
gabby goes on the stage



ished done and exhausted he ap-
peared like a broken-down aeroplane
wabbling about the audience quick to
scent his dilemma was indulging in the
refined cruelties to which moving-pic-
ture audiences are prone grunts
groans cat-calls whistles hisses and
stamping of feet all helped to put gab-
by at his complete ease

  just when it appeared that nothing
but a miracle could save the despairing
songster a large hook wfas shoved out
from the wings it was a generous hook
wide enough to encircle the waist of the
fat youth and the hook did that very
thing it hooked the aspirant none too
gently then some unseen hands gave
it a yank and our friend disappeared
from view with more speed than grace

 never have i heard such wild
screams of delight as that audience in-
dulged in as my friend melted from our
gaze the operator hurriedly slipped
over another moving picture and the
noise died down as the bunch of talent-
killers settled back to have a peek at
the film i slipped quietly out of my
seat and hurried up the aisle as i
reached the back of the orchestra i
bumped into joe mcmasters he looked
at me smiled grimly and remarked

  the tub is some actor isnt he 

  i could only laugh without a word
i hooked mcmasters arm in mine and
together we went back stage directed
by a grinning stage hand we located
gabbys dressing-room the door was
not entirely closed and peeping in we
espied gabby sitting disconsolately on

a chair in front of his make-up mirror
slowly applying the cold creartas 
to remving the make-un

he turned around as we entered
but not a word did he utter after

to me an agc my prots turned

  how was it-pretty rotten eh 
yes it was gabby i answered
figuring it out that it would be best to
tell him the truth no matter how much
it hurt

  wen i guess it was he agreed
ruefully his fat face gradually finding
itself in a wide expansive grin but
ill try anything once its the oniy way
to find out how bad you are

  are you cured  butted in joe

  yes plenty im no stockyards
product i know when the bell has rung
im  actor

  as the stout person and yours truly
were wending our way down broad-
way a dodger was thrust into gabbys
hand he glanced at it and handed it
over to me with a sickly grin

  i	looked at it and burst out laughing
it was the announcement of madame
jara the psychic wonder who agreed
to tell your past present and future for
fifty cents

  are you going to look her up i
inquired smiling at him

  nixey no indeed not theyre
the bunk and then with a whimsical
glance at me he added but the other
one sure was a peacherino i wonder
where she lives

  in the city of baghdad one thou-

goes there was a beggar hajj by

of allah it is of hajj we tell-hajj
and his enemy unto death the villain-

  many years ago jawan had stolen
hajjs wife and killed his babe-and
hajj had dreamed of jawans throat
with his fingers twined around it the
years passed and lo-hajj and jawan
came face to face the sheik spat upon
the beggar and in derision threw to
him a purse of gold hajjs eyes caught
the gold and the power it held before
his hands grasped the treasure-a
treasure tnat brought with it the pos-
sibility of vengeance with this gold
did hajj go into the bazaar of the
tailors and did he deck himself out in
satins and silks and gauds albeit he
stole a portion of these then did he
embrace his daughter marsinah and
promise her happiness bought out of
his newly acquired purse still fat with
change

  marsinah was beloved by a hand-
some young stranger whose identity
she knew not-the gardeners son she
believed him to be in their sun dream
hajj was arrested at the instance of
the merchants whose wares he stole
was brought before the wazir mansur
was sentenced to suffer the removal of
his thieving hand and was pardoned-
but for fell purpose the whisper of
the wazir was in his ears you are
pardoned so it went in order that
you may kill the caliph hajj per-
plexed stood still to kill the caliph

the keenest displeasure he tells his
wife that hugh is worthless that he
wastes his time and neglects his people
to spend his days in playing and de-
clares that despite the fact that his lit-
tle farm should go to the elder son
after his death he is determined that
hugh shall inherit none of the
property

  bat tells shane that the land shall
be his shanes trunk is packed and he
is ready to leave for america bat rips
the tag from the lads trunk affixes
hughs name to it and asserts he will
punish the elder son by exiling him
from his home-land hugh is away
with his companions celebrating an
athletic victory although maura tells
her husband that the priest wished
hugh to go to the celebration so that
he might keep it within bounds bat re-
fuses to believe her hes a worthless
son he repeats and repeats-and troops
off to bed with a curse for hugh on
his trembling lips

  maura because she has realized that
hugh will not be back until late only
pretends to go to sleep when the house
becomes quiet she steals into the outer
room to wait for her son and warn
him of his fathers anger hugh enters
he promises to heed his mothers plea
bat enters and confronts hugh he
calls him every vile name refuses to
still his curses before mauras tears
and banging his way out of the door
shouts to hugh that he will have no
more of him that he must prepare to
leave the place at the earliest possible
moment

  for a minute-a long silent minute
-hugh is mute he is awakened from
his stunned condition by the entrance
of his brother shane the pet of the
family hugh turns on shane charges
him with having prejudiced their
father against him and ends by calling
shane a land-grabber shane jumps at
hughs throat maura enters and at-
tempts wildly to drag shane from
hugh

  shane insults maura and the insult
gives hugh added strength he pulls
shanes fingers from their clutch the
lamp on the table is overturned and
smashed in the struggle and the room
is plunged into darkness only the
sounds of the scuffle and the mothers
wail can be heard the play of the mov-
ing fighting tossing bodies is not to
be seen in the rooms jet black sud-

stands up and peers into the others

  the scene shows the outskirts of a
fair in ireland

  mrs tarpey a deaf old apple wom-
an who is selling her wares to the pass-
ers-by indistinctly overhears a remark
made by bartley fallon a magnificent
pessimist and eternal grumbler bart-
ley has accidentally upset his wifes
market basket while trying to get out
of the way of a pitchfork that some
careless soul has left lying by the way-
side and bartley with a conventional
grumble on his tongue has picked up
the fork and started down the road
with it to return it to jack smith-who
he learns is its owner the deaf wom-

ans ears cause her to believe that bart-
ley has gone after smith to kill him
with the pitchfork and she whispers
this news to various folk who are
near her

  the ball of gossip is thus started
why does bartley want to kill smith
aha the overturned market basket
bartley must have had an argument
with his wife why put two and two
together say the gossips and you will
appreciate that if bartley had a quar-
rel with his wife and then made after
jack smith with a pitchfork to kill him
it must have been because smith and
bartleys wife had been guilty of some-
thing

  she promised to elope to amer-
ica with him ill wager says this one
that one repeats the sentence to an-
other leaving off the ill wager thus
making it a fact

  the news spreads grows more and
more sanguinary and becomes further
and further embellished bartley has
killed jack smith by this time they
figure and jacks body is lying in the
mud of the road the people are hor-
rified startled completely upset by the
tragedy they have created with their
own gossips- imaginations mrs fallon
enters

  the lady is accused she denies
but why all this talk she becomes
suspicious her husband is brought in
having been apprehended by the police
and put in chains mrs fallon accuses
him not only of the crime but also of
having been unfaithful to her

  bartley influenced by the attitude of
the people comes to believe he is guilty
of smiths murder and confesses no
sooner is the confession out of his
mouth than smith comes in alive and
well

  the good people believing it is a
ghost shrink back they are convinced
that he is no ghost and then charge
him with trying to impersonate the
dead jack smith the police are called
upon to arrest him as an impostor and
jack smith and his supposed murderer
are marched away to the jail until rea-
son shall dawn again and gossip be
slain

the green book album

married dipworthy junior scion of
the house which manufactured dipwor-
thy s drowsy drops and upon the un-
timely death of that worthless youth
who had neglected the paternal drops
in favor of pints and quarts  she
came into several million she started
to break into society but although a
guest of mrs mawson when discovered
by shorty she wasnt making much
headway

  pinckney shortys social sponsor
was so lazy that he had to have his
valet breathe for him read his letters
oh dear no my man attends to all
that so when a cablegram came stat-
ing that jack and jill were coming
on the lusitania as per letter he
hadnt the slightest idea what jack and
i ill would be shorty said they sounded
like a couple of shetland ponies and
pinckney agreed with him

  shorty was touched by sadies tale
of social snobbery and put her in
right by fixing it with pinckney to in-
troduce her all around straightway
sadie got an invitation to spend a week
in newport and she called shorty
blessed-though she did not encourage
his sentimental advances

  enter then jack and jill-not a pair
of shetland ponies but a couple of
lively kids of tender years they had
been left orphans in london and their
dying father had wished them on
pinckney nowr will you read your
own letters says shorty when jack
and jill leap upon the embarrassed
pinckney and mess him up with sticky
kisses

  jack and jill prove to be the most
terrible of all infants and proceed to
tear the household of pinckney and his
aunt up by the roots the duty of hir-
ing a governess is delegated to shorty
and he picks out a wistful english girl
named mary dexter who immediately
tames the terrors with kindness and
fairy tales

  sadie is now receiving the attentions
of the baron patchouli alleged to be
of the french aristocracy and captain
kenwoodie who says he is the brother
of the earl of abercorn shorty makes
the baron ridiculous by sending him to
the dog-license window when he asks

how to get a wedding permit and also
by revealing his antecedents as a
waiter

  it isnt the baron about whom shorty
has to worry however so much as the
captain who has persuaded sadie to
marry him on a visit to the cottage
where shorty has his summer train-
ing camp captain kenwoodie tells sa-
die to prepare for a departure to eng-
land the next day-important mes-
sages from home dont you know sadie
consents and even after shorty shows
the captain up as a black sheep who
had been passing bad checks at the
waldorf-astoria she is game to marry
him just for the sake of the title but
when mary dexter the governess con-
fronts the captain and tells how she
had sent him all her rnoney from
abroad following to get married as per
schedule only to find herself alone and
stranded in a strange country sadie
gives the captain his passport

  in the last act pinckney marries miss
gertrude who had come over on the
same boat with jack and jill it is on
the eve of the wedding and shorty
attired in his glad raiment is unhappy
because he too would like to have a
girl enter sadie who had retired from
society after her disappointment with
the captain a few words and all is
oer shorty calls the bishop and every-
one else out of the house just as the
wedding is about to begin tucks sadie
under his arm gets into the proper po-
sition and says now let it go double

 sfiort ptory op c-x
a vaudeville life

   by william carey

outside of the theatre in electric
letters a foot high her name
twinkled and dazzled and beck-
oned by turns and on the billboards
and in the programs lila elsa was
printed in heavy black type she was
the headliner the star of a lengthy bill
yet judging from the applause that fol-
lowed her first song one would never
have thought so in the parlance of
vaudeville she had failed to deliver
the goods

  the three dancing graces stood in
the wings and watched her struggle
bravely through a second song with
even less success than had been meted
out to its predecessor the graces two
men and a girl followed miss elsa and
with an eddie foy imitation a george
cohan finish waving american flags

and an apache number they deserved
the excellent position on the bill given
them by a discriminating manager

  theyre worth a dozen lila elsas
and only half the salary he grumbled
watching the headliner little effie
there may not be able to snatch high c
and hold it for five minutes without
takin a swallow but vaudeville patrons
dont want high cs heavens knows
elsa is punk

  the three graces thought exactly
the same thing although effie tried her
hardest to scrape an acquaintance with
her and dave watched her each time
he got a chance as if she were a god-
dess just come down to earth even
jack while he laughed at her to effie
looked upon her as a creature out of
their own world


ace high



  she got the frozen mitten to-night
all right he said in an aside as she
finished her second song honest if
she goes out there again and begins
another song im afraid the gallery will
start something

  i hope not said dave quickly

  oh dave joure that sympathetic
giggled effie as jack says shes got
a punk act and you cant expect a
classy show-me audience to stand for
her sort o stuff when they know we
are on the bill but your hearts in the
right place davy aint it jack
dave only frowned and listened at-
tentively as lila walked out on the
stage again and began a charming
waltz-song from one of the light operas
in her sweet bell-like soprano

  thats singing he said presently
with a little nod of his head

  think so shrugged effie well
youre welcome to it because nobody
round here seems to want it what
she ought to do if she wants to make
a hit is to get some swell clothes and
sing that dont forget me song to a
man in a box that would get em-
audiences like to hear a girl sing to a
man in a box especially a bald-headed
man-te-he

  good lord effie ill bet you miss
elsa would fall dead if youd suggest
such a thing to her cried dave
wrinkling his forehead thoughtfully
she-she aint that kind you know
listen to him will you pouted
effie why i did it aint i as good as
her-or anybody

  sure emphasized jack

  dave took her hand and pressed it
softly

  i didnt mean that honey he told
her a tender light creeping in his eyes
theres nobody going any better than
you are-whiter prettier neater i only
meant that lila elsa wasnt the kind
of actress to sing to a man in the box-
thats all

  she is right hefty declared the
petite effie somewhat satisfied i cant
see her dancing my apache stuff can
you 

  at that moment lila finished her
last song and walked off the stage the
applause that followed her was none

warmth st did t carr- much
warmth lila elsa in an opera bv

broad t dc isven coud fill a
broadway theatre for six months but

nlfi twaday patrons appreciated
neither her voice nor her methods

  she seemed to realize this with a
little sigh she drew the heavy fur-lined
cloak around her shoulders and telling
her maid to go ahead to her dressing-
room waited in the wings thoughtfully
watching the three dancing graces
from the moment the annunciators
flashed their letter the house had ap-
plauded until the rafters rang when
dave did his eddie foy imitation the
audience rocked with merriment effie
and jacks apache dance brought
squeals of delight from the galleries
while the george cohan finale with the
three singing the yankee doodle rag
and waving american flags at the
people literally brought down the
house and lila wondered

  she would be in vaudeville only four
weeks just long enough for the libret-
tist to americanize the book of her
new viennese opera-comique because
of her name and position she had been
able to secure the choicest booking for
the short time she would be idle and
while it mattered little to her following
what these patrons of the varieties
thought of her still it hurt it rankled
to think that she had not been able to
please them her choicest notes had not
brought forth one half the appiause
that had greeted effies danse paris-
ienne

   ill do it she decided

  the three dancing graces had
finished their turn and after six bows
were reluctantly allowed to depart
lila still in the wings knew they would
be obliged to pass her on their way to
their dressing-room as effie came off
the stage with the set smile still on her
pretty features the prima donna went
out to meet her

  miss grace may i ask you a ques-
tion she said

  effie was overwhelmed with joy in
her heart of hearts she secretly envied
and respected this broadway star

  why certainy she dimpled ask
a hundred


the green book album

  lila drew the girl to one side and
out of the way of the stage-hands
dave and jack moving away a few
paces were still in hearing distance

  its just this began lila with an
embarrassed smile i dont seem able
to reach my audiences somehow i
havent made a hit and i must you
know-the management the people
everybody expects it ive worn my
prettiest gowns and sung my favorite
songs and yet i cant win them what
is the secret of your success may i ask
miss grace

  well we give em what they want
and you dont effie returned simply
thats all there is to it

  you mean  inquired the puzzled
lila

  she means your act is over their
heads they cant appreciate it miss
elsa put in dave eagerly his face
flushing under its grease-paint its no
use for you to try to got the audience
here up to your songs youve got to
come down to them if jou want to
make good

  i do nodded lila flashing him a
grateful smile

  your singings grand understand
miss elsa he said again a ring of
eagerness in his voice its singing
ours isnt but-it doesnt strike a pop-
ular chord-somehow

  youre right she said slowly

  effie tilted her head on one side like
a pert sparrow and very earnestly
caught and held the stars attention

  i was saying to the boys when we
were watching your act that what you
wanted was classy up-to-date stuff
effie declared askin your pardon
your songs sound like the ones my
granmother used to put me to sleep
with  im not saying theyre not good--
dave and all of us know they are swell
but theyre not good for here-vaude-
ville the only one thats not a joy-kill-
er is dont forget me and again ask-
in your pardon you sing that like the
audience was at a wake with the hearse
outside the stage-door waitin for the
corpse what you want is ginger 
ginger gasped lila good heav-
ens what for

   i mean you want to put a little gin-

ger in your work said effie unruffled
take dont forget me now get a
swell red dress to come just lielow the
knees and make em fit you-youve
got a good figure why not show it
j hen get a big black and red hat with
a bunch o gold lace on it i think that
would make a stunt tin costume then
hire a man to sit in one o the boxes and
sing dont forget me to him let him
do a little comedy business you know
and you put a little warmth in your
work and i guarantee the house  go
mad now you go out and sing dont
forget me and yet you dont give em
nothing to remember of course thats
only what  think still- she
shrugged her shoulders and tried not to
look too conscious o course thats
only my way o thinking she added

  shes right nodded jack

  i-believe she is myself sjsoke up
dave although i dont see myself
how an audience could forget your fine
voice miss elsa

  lila gave him a grateful nod of
thanks she couldnt just see herself in
the costume effie had sketched and yet
she wanted to make a hit

  so you all think that if i got another
gown and sang to a man in a box id
make out better she asked presently

  yes they chorused together

  but i have no man she hesitated

  daves got a grand voice effie said
eagerly hell do it for you miss elsa
wont you dave and he can sing the
last chorus with you too thats alwaya
good for an encore you know

  oh i couldnt cried lila

 now dave wants to dont you
dave flashed effie

 my dear miss grace-

  hed like to do it said effie tri-
umphantly

  i would indeed added dave with
an admiring glance it aint  trouble

  lila turned helplessly away

  this is too much you are all too
good she murmured ill never for-
get your kindness but i cant allow
mr-mr-to do this for me i just
cant

  now miss elsa you let dave do
it said jack quickly it will help yur
act and wont be any trouble to him
ace high



 and so it was settled or rather miss

elsa was to meet the three dancing piut differemhand  costumed her

graces in the hotel dining-room in half	new popular sones with rt

an hour and they were to make the final	was all about moonlight  nd t w

arrangements for the new act for lila	named rnv  z 
had decided to accept daves services
and effies advice only she was afraid
of what her maid

of

 vv-

might say when
she heard about
the change

  effie hurried
away to her dress-
ing-room with her
head held high
and a rosy flush of
excitement prettily
coloring her
cheeks

  them sisters
astoria saw me
talking intimately
with lila elsa
star all rig h t
boys she cooed
with a satisfied
smile i guess
theyll try to lord
it over me again-
not

  yes it does
feel kind of good
to bask in the light
of the star doesnt
it said dave
thoughtfully

  it soon became a
regular thing for
lila to have sup-
per with the graces
each night after the
show sometimes
they had dinner together before the
evening performance and once she
went shopping with effie it seemed to
her that no matter which way she
turned there was always one of them
near to suggest this or propose that
and while they were not people she
would have ever picked out for com-
panions much less friends matters
drifted along by degrees until at least
a fair show of friendliness was pre-
sented to the outside world

  that they had helped her with her
act was an undisputed truth following

tltdkit	tsr

named roy who loved a goil named
-pearl and was declared to be the gem
the collection by the zealous effie

lila felt like apol-
  ogizing at least
  through the press
  the first time she
  sang it but io and
  behold she took
  six bows after the
  second verse the
  three dancing
  graces counted
  them on their
  fingers

                     dave grace who
clowned for laughs
in a box when she
sang her famous
waltz-song dont
forget me was a
tall slim clean-cut
man with a bari-
tone voice which
he handled almost
artistically consid-
ering that he had
had little or no
training of the
three he was the
least vulgar the
most tactful he
was quiet but he
was never stupid
often at supper
w h i  e effie and
jack were loudly
discussing the mer-
its of the various performers in the din-
ing-room lila and dave would sit and
discuss some book she had given him
to read she found that he had read
little because they had no time for
reading but he was intelligent and lie
quickly grasped the meanings which
she pointed out to him through the
books

  when it was learned on thursday
that both the three dancing graces
and lila elsa were to play the same
city the following week effies joy was
outspoken and unmistakable


the green book album

  weve all got to be such good
friends  guess wed miss each other
if we went separate ways now eh r
she smiled affectedly

  it will be nice said jack

  and we can work up a good finish
for your new song you know dave
put in

  lila protested feebly

  you know  cant let you do this
for me any longer she cried you
have been too kind and  have pre-
sumed on your kindness as it is and
now i must get a man to work with me
regularly

  oh now just listen to her will
you cried effie airily youll do
nothing of the kind will she boys of
course dave will do that for you just
as long as he can-its such a little
thing

  but its unprofessional hazarded
the star hoping that this would bear
weight with effie

  between friends- shrugged effie
and so the matter was allowed to stand
lila comforted herself with the re-
minder that her new opera would be
ready for rehearsal earlier than she ex-
pected and thn without wounding
their feelings or without seeming un-
grateful for their help in shaping her
act for her she could turn her back on
the three dancing graces and say
good-by to them forever

  theyre not our kind miss lila
her maid had insisted more than once
youd be ashamed to ask them to your
house to dinner some sunday night and
have all your friends meet them now
wouldnt you they may be nice yes
miss lila but so is a spanish mackerel
with drawn butter the young woman
miss effie they call her is grating she
sets a bodys nerves all on edge shes
forever fixing things and that mr
jack hes worse-if possible only
mr dave miss lila-

  yes said the star quietly as the
woman hesitated what about mr
dave martha

  well if hed ever get away from the
other two i guess he might have a fight-
ing chance miss lila martha an-
swered grimly he hasnt got a fussy
look about him and he talks more as

you talk than the others hes almost
presentable still theyre not your sort
its kinder to drop them now miss

lila

   while she recognized the truth of the
womans remarks lila silenced her
gently but firmly-only the old crea-
tures long and faithful service saved
her from a scolding for somehow lila
elsa star did not like to hear the truth
aout handsome dave grace but
marthas words left their mark and
she found herself wondering how she
could break with the dancing act with-
out hurting their feelings

   is it possible that people are watch-
ing perhaps laughing she frowned at
herself in the mirror i lila elsa fall-
ing in love with a cheap vaudevillian
ridiculous ill show them all

  that night when her song dont
forget me with dave sittingv in a
lower box and clowning for laughs had
brought her out on the stage again and
again in answer to the applause of the
audience and the house-manager had
complimented her on the vst improve-
ment of her work lila elsa was re-
minded of what she owed to the graces
she would never have thought of sing-
ing her song in such a fashion but for
them the applause she received they
had given her and they were so genu-
inely glad that she had made good
and had been so sincere in their efforts
to help her that she called herself an
ungrateful beast and promised to go to
supper with them as usual

   effie dressed for the street and with
that ever restless over-anxious air that
so irritated poor martha peeped into
the stars room while lila was chang-
ing

  kin i help you martha is there
anything i kin do she asked now
dont hesitate to say so if there is

  theres nothing effie thank you
nodded lila with a smile while martha
tossed her gray head in fine indignation

  the girl opened the door and step-
ping inside sank down on the huge
theatre trunk from the tips of her
brown sudde shoes to the huge black
hat with its scarlet plumes set rakishly
on her blonde curls she was the picture
of unadorned vulgarity lila blushed
ace high



for her and yet effie was pretty be-
neath this mass of cheap tasteless
finery and she was still in her first
youth lila sighed

  as soon as martha had gone effie
went over and taking lila by the shoul-
ders turned her face to the light there
was a smile on her lips but a puzzled
look in her eyes which lila didnt un-
derstand

  honest now said the girl at last
do rou love jack

  lila stared at her saying nothing

  i think jack is in love with you
effie rattled on he told me just now
to take dave and go on ahead cause
he wanted to walk home with you and
tell you something he never seemed to
notice a woman before it got me guess-
ing do you jacks a dear good boy
before the cruel cutting words which
came rushing in answer to effies ques-
tion were spoken dave called her name
knuckling sharply on the door but she
was tingling with indignation when she
joined them in the corridor and the
look of mingled pity and contempt she
threw at jack would have frightened
off a less determined person

  with a gay laugh dave drew effies
arm through his and hurried her out
of the stage-door leaving lila alone
with jack she turned upon him like a
perfect fury her dark eyes gleaming
black in her anger

  what is it you wanted to say to
me quickly i can give you only a
moment but weigh your words before
you speak and remember that i loath
the very sight-

  itll only take a minute he said
quietly interrupting her its just this
youve got to quit your love-makin
with dave grace

  she could have struck him but she
didnt white breathless she gazed with
fascinated eyes at the unruffled deadlv-
in-eamest little man

  why she almost whispered
because came the answer effie
loves him

  effie she laughed

  yes funny aint it he said you
laugh at them things in your world on
broadway dont you  but strange as it
may seem to you for a wife to love her

husband little effie loves dave i think
-she worships him why she loves
him so believes in him blindly without
questions that she hasnt seen yet what
everybody else sees and laughs at-you
and dave youre in love with him
dont deny it anybody kin see it in
your eyes when you talk to him its
got to be stopped do y hear why it
would kill effie if she knew

  i or a second there was a brief si-
lence then when she spoke her beau-
tiful voice was a-quiver with emotion

  i didnt know-i didnt know she
said

  didnt know-what

  that effie was-his wife

  jack laughed shrilly you didnt
know you didnt care thats the
broadway idea i know thank god
we aint got there yet if thems the mor-
als that street is paved with oh you
knew-everybody knows that they are
married-six years and two months to
a day i know you didnt care you
liked daves handsome face his way
hes got a way with the women-they
all like him i dont make any comment
there hes good company and handy
with the blarney youre not the first
ive seen nor the last either i guess
but he always came back to effie still
you seemed so determined-

  determined she repeated flushing
cruelly

  yes you seemed to hang on so
tight he nodded you were a long
time making up your mind that he was
good enough for you but once you
did-

  dont stop she put out her hand
with an imploring gesture you are
cruel she sobbed you are saving
things which no man would say to a
woman

  im playing the game as you play
it miss elsa he returned a trifle
wearily what do you think would
have happened to effie if you had
walked off taking dave with you to
sing on your new show 

  i didnt ask him she whispered
guiltily

  no but rou were thinking about
it he nodded oh  know ive
watched you-watched all three of you


the green book album

effie dont suspect anything yet thank
god shes only proud as punch of
dave because you let him sing your
choruses miss elsa she aint like you
in looks and talk maybe-she was a
cash-girl in a department store over in
brooklyn once-but she aint got a mean
bone in her body and shes true-blue
all through shes-ace-high

  then lila leaned over and said very
distinctly

  if dave went with me-granting i
want him of course-wouldnt it be
better for you it would give you a
chance to win her then

  he turned a brick-red miserable
heart-sick his thin lips twitched nerv-
ously

   aint never said that even to my-
self he told her but its true i think
ive always-loved effie even before
she married dave i seen her first but
when dave came along-just look at
him and then at me-theres your an-
swer but i do love her-i do and ill
watch out for her protect her bring
dave back each time he runs away to
play ill move heaven and earth to keep

them together i aint thinking of my-
self-why even if anything should
happen to dave she wouldnt look at
me-except the way she does now as a
good old pal thats what i am you
know-a pal

  lila elsa drew the folds of her cloak
more closely around her she was sud-
denly cold

  im going back to new york-to-
night she said gently never mind
the management here a few hundred
will fix it with them and ill never
never see dave again if i can help it
you believe me dont you and as for
their being married i just never-
thought such things dont seem to
count for much on broadway youre
right i must be years older than dave
too but never mind you go and tell
them i am ill-dont let effie come to
me please -couldnt stand it jc
now good-by will you shake lianas
with me id like to because you are
so-fine

  he shook hands silently

  good-by he said  think you are
ace-high too
    protecting plays

little understood facts about the copyright office
explained by the registrar of copyrights

one morning last spring a well
known theatrical manager in new
york issued an item to various
papers announcing the name of a new
play which he had purchased for early
production

  in his mail the following day were
five letters of protest all reading prac-
tically the same from five different un-
known authors objecting to the use of
the name he had announced

  i beg to inform you wrote one of
the unknowns that you cannot use
the name you have selected because
five years ago i copyrighted this same
title for a melodrama which i now
own of course if you see fit to pro-
duce my own play with this title i
would like to make arrangements with
you or i will consider a reasonable of-
fer for the purchase of the title other-
wise i will be compelled to apply for an
injunction to prevent infringement of
my copyright

  now if five different people laid
claim to the same title and each offered
it for sale to this manager it was evi-
dent some one was laboring under a
misapprehension the manager there-

fore undertook to obtain a little light
upon just how it was possible for five
different authors to lay claim to a cer-
tain title each asserting that he owned
the copyright on the name selected

  and here the manager made a dis-
covery the information came direct
from thorvald solberg the official
registrar of copyrights at the library
of congress in washington and as the
decision might possibly save many au-
thors and managers much worry and
letter-writing it is here given briefly

you cannot copyright a title

 when emerson smith-jones the
eminent or aspiring playwright com-
pletes a drama has it neatly typewrit-
ten to conform to certain copyright
rules and finally selects his title he for-
wards it to washington with one dol-
lar to the registrar of copyrights and
leans back with a satisfied air saying
to himself

  now let anyone steal my play it
is copyrighted and the united states
government will protect me against any
infringement




the green book album

  in iue time emerson smith-jones
receives a neatly printed card notifying
him that the registrar of copyrights has
received his manuscript entitled a
bird in the hand and that certificate
of copyright no  class d has
been issued to him certifying to the de-
posit in the library archives of one
typewritten manuscript of said play on
such and such a date according to law

  apparently this is final and absolute
as the copyright statutes give an author
of a dramatic or musical composition
exclusive rights for a period of 
years with a further extension of 
years if applied for at the end of the
original period

after a few years

 mr emerson smith-jones
congratulates himself upon his happy
selection of the title a bird in the
hand and undertakes to sell his play
ultimately it comes back to him from
 managers and is laid away in his
desk years afterwards he picks up the
morning telegraph and reads that
charles frohman or klaw  erlanger
propose to produce a play called a
bird in the hand by augustus thom-
as or eugene walter

  emerson smith - jones vigorously
protests he has copyrighted the title
he asserts and his lawyer writes threat-
ening letters of the fearful facts that
follow infringement emerson smith-
jones wakes up when he receives a lit-
tle light on what constitutes copyright
according to our laws

  the copyright office is a mere office
of record perhaps mr solberg will
write as he has so often explained
verbally to anxious authors the cer-
tificate issued simply states that there
has been received for entry and deposit
a certain manuscript with such and
such a title there is nothing in the
copyright laws to prohibit us from re-
ceiving fifty manuscripts with exactly
similar titles as far as we know the
material of these fifty plays with the
same title may be the same or it may
be different the duty of the librarian
of congress is to receive all manu-
scripts accompanied by the necessary

legal fees enter them according to cer-
tain forms and acknowledge the re-
ceipt by issuing a certificate of copy-
right it is not only possible to issue
fifty certificates for manuscripts with
similar titles but cases have actually
been called to the librarians attention
where perhaps a dozen titles have been
recorded all the same for manuscripts
which had no bearing whatever upon
each other and no features of resem-
blance

  the important point is that the
copyright law grants protection to the
material that is the dialogue and story
while no reference whatever is made
to the titles

merely an office of record

  flrthermore any case of in-
fringement cannot concern the library
of congress all disputes must be set
tied in court where the copyright laws
must be interpreted by the legal author-
ities it is not within our province to
settle any case of alleged infringement
our office is merely one of record if
an author thinks some one else has ap-
propriated his ideas he can prove by
his copyright certificate that he depos-
ited his own manuscript with our office
and the possession of his certificate is
accepted as prima facie evidence that
he has complied with the law by com-
paring a certified copy of his own
manuscript with the alleged infringe-
ment the truth or falsity of the allega-
tion can be established but this must
be done in the courts and not here

  this matter of titles is most prolific
of promised law-suits which of course
never materialize when the authors
learn the real law on the subject

  even large publishing houses occa-
sionally fall into error a case in point
which apparently presented a new ques-
tion arose when a new york manager
announced that he intended to produce
a play called the worldlings one
of the big publishing firms had issued
a novel called worldlings a book
which had not attained very great suc-
cess and concerning which the author
of the drama knew nothing at all the
publishing firm threatened suit on the
protecting plays



ground that the title of the book had
been appropriated for the play and that
the intention was to mislead the pub-
lic into the belief that the play was a
dramatization of the novel as a mat-
ter of fact there was no actual resem-
blance between the two stories and
when the worldlings proved a fail-
ure nothing more was heard of the
suit

many titles are changed

  to avoid litigation many man-
agers often change the titles slightly
one manager produced a play called
told in the hills but when he
learned this was the title of a novel
he changed his play to as told in the
hills because the title the wife
had been used years ago eugene wal-
ter changed the title of a recent play to
just a wife countless other in-
stances of slight changes to avoid
threatened suits could be mentioned
but as a matter of fact all of these
changes were not necessary

  last spring many stock companies
played a farce called the circus
girl and a music publishing house
spent a lot of money frightening man-
agers by dire threats because they we re
using the title of a daly musical com-
edy of fifteen years ago one man-
ager actually changed the title to the
girl from the circus to avoid a
threatened suit a sharp letter to the
music publishing concern would have
convinced that corporation that its
complaint was not justified

  but i can fancy some one asking
how is it that there have been fights
in the courts over titles and that some
managers have prevented other man-
agers from using the titles of big suc-
cesses if what you say is true why
cannot i send out a small company to
plav small towns with any old show
and call it the pink lady klaw 
erlanger might object but how could
they stop me and what about froh-
mans well remembered suit which he
won about the title laiglon and
how did henry w savage prevent
anyone else from using the title the
merry widow even going so far as
to stop a company from presenting a

dramatic version of that musical com-
edy 

    hese questions can all be answered
and they show how you can protect a
title under certain conditions you can
protect a title if you bring suit in
equity alleging that other parties are
endeavoring to impose upon the pub-
lic by false pretences and that the use
of the title is intended to mislead the
public into the belief that it is getting
the original and not the imitation here
it is within the discretion of the trial
judge to decide whether or not you
have advertised a certain article suffi-
ciently long to give you common rights
and whether or not the alleged appro-
priation of your title is made with an
attempt to deceive and mislead in
such a case an injunction preventing
such imposture could be issued but
the plaintiff would have no ground for
financial damages

the way it works

  to illustrate suppose klaw
 erlanger produce the pink lady-
on a certain night suppose a rival
manager produces another play mu-
sical or dramatic entitled the pink
lady at approximately the same time
in a theatre right across the street from
the klaw  erlanger pink lady the
klaw  erlanger forces might apply
for an injunction to prevent the other
pink lady title from being used on
the ground that the opposition was en-
deavoring to trade upon the reputation
of the real pink lady but if the op-
position could show that they planned
to produce an entirely different play
and that the title had been chosen in
good faith with no intention to decen e
the injunction would undoubtedly be
denied

  but if the second pink lady an-
nouncement were made after the origi-
nal pink lady had scored a sensa-
tional success the intent to deceive
would be so plain that an injunction
would undoubtedly be granted i his
bear in mind would have nothing
whatever to do with the question ot

copyright		 

   it was by this process of reasoning


the green book album

that mr savage protected the merry
widow the case of laiglon was
a trifle different and illustrates one
other method of protecting a title-and

an excellent one

  mr frohman had the title laig-
lon registered as a trade-mark at the
united states patent office in wash-
ington trade-marks are registered as
brands or identifying marks to firms
and manufacturers to be used in ad-
vertising their products and goods
obviously they are intended primarily
for manufactured articles and not for
plays

  but there is nothing to prohibit the
use of a word as a trade-mark in fact
perhaps half of the trade-marks regis-
tered are unusual words or combina-
tions of words it costs  to register
a trade-mark at the patent office and
mr frohman paid this cheerfully for
a trade-mark on the word laiglon
thereafter he was able to prevent any-
one from selling laiglon corsets or
laiglon underwear and incident-
ally from presenting laiglon plays

what the law does

  the vagaries of the copyright law
have been straightened out gradually
without going into the history of all
the movements to afford dramatic
writers protection for their wares it
can be stated that until the last few
years play piracy was quite common
until quite recently such offences were
punishable only by the expenditure of
much time and money on the part of
the plaintiffs and then the best they
could obtain was an injunction and
stipulated damages which were hard
to collect recent statutes and court
decisions however have established
these conditions

  play piracy or willful infringement
of copyright is a penal offense

   he author of a novel retains owner-
ship of the dramatic rights

  you can copyright dialogue and
stage business in a play or vaude-
ville sketch but you cannot copyright
acrobatic acts stage tricks lighting
effects scenic effects etc

any part of a stage performance

singing dialogue or music cannot be
reproduced upon phonographic records
without the permission of the author
or owner

  and-under the recent sweeping de-
cision of the supreme court in the
ben hur case-moving pictures are
an infringement upon the copyright of
a book or play no matter if a complete
new scenario of the story is written
and only parts of the original are util-
ized

  readers of theatrical weekly trade
papers may often read large announce-
ments from such mythical acts as the
bulldog brothers the three sweet-
singing sirens or the marvelous
madcapsstating that our act is fully
protected by copyright and any in-
fringements will be prosecuted to the
limit of the law

  as a matter of fact such advertisers
may be violating the copyright law by
claiming protection for one provision
of the law expressly provides a penalty
for anyone claiming copyright without
complying with the copyright law
furthermore the bulldog brothers
probably do a neat song and dance act
with a little bit of dialogue stolen from
puck or judge and wear eccentric cos-
tumes it sounds great to claim that
their act is copyrighted and such asser-
tions probably scare off many would-be
imitators but you cannot obtain pro-
tection for a clog dance an acrobatic
tumble a bundle of stage tricks or con-
certed effects

 when ned wavburn produced a
vaudeville sketch called the minstrel
misses showing  girls in black-face
he widely announced that he had copy-
righted ned wayburns minstrel
misses and that any act doing a
black-face scene with girls would be
prosecuted to the limit of the law and
amazing as it may seem he scared off
several other vaudeville managers from
producing similar acts though how his
act could possibly interest the library
of congress is not quite clear

he scared them off

  when bert whitney produced a
broken idol in new york he had
protecting plays

pretty alice yorke swing out over the
heads of the audience sitting in a bas-
ket of an illuminated balloon while
the auditorium was in darkness the
effect was striking and novel and made
a lot of talk it was a trick done with
wires yet when some one tried to imi-
tate the act mr whitney announced
that it was copyrighted and published
large advertisements intended to scare
off imitators

  a certain stage director gus sohlke
devised several new chorus evolutions
for a new shubert musical production
two or three years ago he is an inge-
nious and resourceful producer who
succeeded in getting some very pretty
and novel effects and the program
bore the announcement stage effects
and chorus evolutions designed and
copyrighted by gus sohlke all in-
fringements will be strictly prose-
cuted

  this general ignorance concerning
copyright has cost stage folk a lot of
money and incidentally it has produced
a rich harvest for a certain class of un-
scrupulous lawyers in washington
several young chaps who might other-
wise starve have obtained good in-
comes by catering especially to players
vaudeville acts and unknown authors
they advertise in the theatrical papers
and send out circulars pointing out the
infinite advantages of getting protec-
tion for your play sketch or act

  vaudeville players-those who prob-
ably claim in good faith that their acts
are copyrighted-are the easiest vic-
tims for the sum of  so the circu-
lars and ads read you can have your
manuscript copyrighted and then of
course there is the attorneys fee which
may be anywhere from  to 
according to the gullibility or affluence
of the person addressed

  inexperienced people who know lit-
tle of the workings of the government
at washington are easily led into en-
gaging one of these attorneys to handle
the matter perhaps they live at remote
distances from washington or are on
tour and do not know the proper meth-
od of procedure a letter from an at-
torney with aii embossed letter-head
reading copyright business a spe-



cialty seems impressive so the manu-

onvi ssent u- t the lawyer who not
y collects his own fee in advance

but may even write back that the manu-
script must be newly typewritten upon
fresh heavy paper this will cost  or
 more

  all the attorney does for this fee is
to walk up capitol hill in washington
deposit the copy and pay one dollar to
the registrar of copyrights then he
receives a certificate which he mails to
the author

  the attorney does nothing which the
author himself cannot do by mail for
two cents for one postage stamp and a
letter of inquiry the author will receive
from the library of congress a com-
plete set of blank forms which any
school boy could fill out and a large
official envelope franked in which the
manuscript can be sent postage free to
the copyright office the fee of  must
be sent at the same time within ten
days you will receive your copyright
certificate

  in the case of vaudeville actors who
are no doubt misled into the belief that
their act is copyrighted the attorney
will advise them to have a fresh type-
written copy made of all dialogue and
stage business with description of their
act and the title under which they play
it this can easily be elaborated into
ten or twelve typewritten pages this
is neatly bound with a stiff cover and
presented as a play to be copyrighted

  i have known cases where one act
plays presented by these attorneys for
copyright were mere scenarios and de-
scriptions of acrobatic performances
comedy pantomime parlor tricks and
even of such an act as a bicycle evolu-
tion without a dozen spoken words
yet if this is presented as a one act
comedy or playlet and looks like a
play the library of congress is bound
to accept the manuscript even though
the courts might afterwards decide that
no real protection can be granted to
such an act the important point is that
the attorney collects a fee of perhaps
 for services absolutely useless or
at any rate unnecessary and the
vaudeville artist is misled into thinking
he has gained protection

william collier

william collier is above all else an actor of personality that is the principal secret
of his success in that article he tells how absolutely essential a factor it is in making

good on the stage

it is not my intention to write a
ponderous article on the subject of
personality our public libraries
are filled with books old and new
many of which take you through the
labyrinths of philosophy and meta-
physics they discuss at great length
the question of mans personality in
the abstract and give you concrete
examples galore but in so far as the

writer knows they have but little
to say along the particular line of the
personality of the actor and that is
what we intend talking about

  what would you think if you ever
took the trouble to think about it at
all the average actor likes best to
do to hunt to fish to mow his
lawn in summer providing he has
one to mow or to shovel the snow
personality



from his sidewalks in winter provid-
ing he owns sidewalks on which to
ply a shovel to collect rare books
to chase his pet hobby whether it
be rattlesnakes or old stamps to the
limit

  he may like to do any one or more
of these things but it is not the thing
he likes best to do no indeed

  above everything else aside from
actually appearing before an audi-
ence the average actor likes best of
all to go to the theatre and be audi-
ence

  all of which has but little to do
with what i am about to write in this
story but being an actor myself it
may explain why i like to visit the
playhouses when not actually appear-
ing with my own company



  on one of those rare occasions
when my playhouse was dark and
i had an opportunity to go to the
theatre and be a regular fellow i
looked up a doctor friend of mine he
is just as expert in diagnosing the
ills that affect plays as he is those
that beset humans it was decided
that a musical comedy offered the
best promise of a panacea for our
particular state of mind so to a mu-
sical comedy we hied ourselves

  the piece was just an average up-
to-date musical show it had the
usual elaborate cast of high salaried
principals and an immense chorus
all of which tended to bring down
the batting average of the producers
net receipts it proceeded along the
even tenor of its way with bright
spots and low spots to hold your in-
terest and depress you into a condi-
tion where you wondered how on
earth such things could be

  i remember i was indulging in the
most beautiful yawn imaginable
when my companion nudged me and
accompanied the dig in the side with

the suggestion that i have a look
without any rhyme or reason and
having nothing whatever to do with
the story a group of pony dancers
had burst into view the producer
probably figured that it was a good
spot into which to inject the
dancers seeing he had them under
contract and must make them do
something to earn their salaries



  there were eight girls none of
them older than she had made up to
be and possibly none of them mar-
ried they danced well in unison
their mechanical skill was of a high
order of excellence each of the
dancers was dressed in the same
style of dress but there was some-
thing distinctive about this group
there was one who stood out head
and shoulders above the other seven
she was not visibly more comely
did not have a finer figure neither
was she a better dancer than any
one of her mates yet she was dis-
tinctly different she instinctively
appealed to you as being of a higher
and better grade as an artist

  and this brings us right down to
what we want to talk about this
dancing girl without possessing any
extraordinary amount of talent was
able to project her individuality over
the footlights so that we practically
lost sight of the other seven the
reason was simple she possessed
that rare and most necessary quality
personality

  personality just what is it if you
care to take the definition of the
erudite individuals who compiled the
dictionary it consists of the attri-
butes that make up the character and
nature of an individual that which
distinguishes and characterizes an in-
dividual

  this definition while comprehen-
sive enough in itself hardly conveys
the green book album



the idea as to what personality in
so far as it refers to the actor really
means

  let us endeavor to illustrate just
what it means you have we will
say a favorite actor you like to go
to the theatre in which he appears
whether his play be good or bad
you enjoy listening to him speak his
lines portray emotions and go
through the action designated for the
character he may be assuming

  just why do you like this particu-
lar actor is it because he is good
looking possibly to a certain extent
but let me remind you other good
looking actors have not succeeded in
winning your championship just
what is it then that accounts for
your liking and admiration nothing
more or less than his personality



  personality means vastly more than
the possession of good looks a hand-
some figure talent a pleasant man-
ner or technical training in the pro-
fession of the actor strictly speak-
ing we cannot define personality it
is intangible gustave lebon a noted
writer on the subject in commenting
on the fact that it is difficult to de-
fine personality in set terms says
that the fundamental characteristic
of personality is self-consciousness-
or literally an object saying to itself
-i am i 

  this writer evidently had in mind
the idea that it is a characteristic that
belongs to an individual that makes
him in his own person an object of
interest if you are particularly in-
terested in some actor it is because
the personality of that actor as shown
in his individuality has appealed to
your senses if you were asked point
blank to say why mr so-and-so is
popular with the play-going public

you would probably be at a loss all
you know or have ever taken the
trouble to find out is that this favor-
ite actor of yours seems to be differ-
ent from other men of about the
same methods and stamp



  i recall vividly the days when
i was a call-boy in the company of
augustin daly at dalys theatre in
new york those were historic days
in american dramatics many men
and women who afterwards achieved
distinction and even fame as actors
were members of our company i
know that i was impressed as a
youngster by the personalities of
some members of the company to a
far greater extent than others

  a striking example of personality
in an actor is to be found in the case
of mr john drew undoubtedly oae
of the best known stars now appear-
ing before the public mr drew was
a member of the daly company he
had a very marked personality and
was popular not alone with the pub-
lic who loved him for his talents and
skill as an actor and were attracted
by his personal charm but with th
other members of the group



  during late years mr drew has
confined his attention to what are
popularly known as straight parts
it has been said by some unthinking
people that mr drew does not essay
the difficult parts he did when ap-
pearing at dalys and during other
earlier periods of his career

  one of the finest tributes i have
ever heard paid to an actor was in
overhearing a worthy citizen declare
during a conversation that john
drew does not act he just plays him-
self unwittingly the worthy citizen
had placed his finger on the vital
personality



spot the fact that such an actor as
john drew can go on season after
season essaying straight parts
proves that he is not only a master
technician but the possessor of a won-
derful personality

  that it is more difficult by far to
play straight parts as compared
with what are known as character
parts is best shown in the salaries
that are paid to the two classes of
actors any manager or actor will
tell you that it is a comparatively
simple matter to find character ac-
tors while it is difficult sometimes
extremely so to secure the services of
adequate actors for straight parts

  touching upon this question of
parts perhaps a word or two in ex-
planation of the professional under-
standing of the two terms may not be
amiss a straight part is one that
presents no sharp outlines which
does not depart from normal stand-
ards which represents what is for
the audience the average man or
woman

  a character part on the other
hand is one that not alone calls for a
greater or less disguising of the ac-
tors form and features a sharp con-
trast between his actual appearance
and his stage appearance-in short a
physical impersonation-but is a part
that is sharply defined as a type and
departs widely from the accepted
standards of the audience



  one of the most glaring and com-
mon errors into which people fall in
their judgment of acting is their
failure to realize the greater dif-
ficulty of playing a straight part
over playing a character part a
character part offers a player a far
more definite outline on which to

build his idea of the character he
may be called upon to portray the
most difficult part of his work has
already been done for him by the
playwright on the other hand a
straight part offers the actor little
more than the opportunity to create
a character to what extent he may
realize and develop the playwrights
conception of the character is largely
a question of his own ability and
skill

  the majority of leading roles in
modern plays are written as straight
parts the modern star selects a
role that fits him and his personality
this practice has its bad features
however frequently an actor essay-
ing a straight role will go through
the play making clear each of the
points in the dialogue and bringing
out the full value of the situations
and defining just what the author had
in mind yet one-half your audience
will declare that he was not acting
at all



  on the other hand let some player
of a small character part give you a
passable imitation of the character he
is supposed to be essaying and your
audience will grow enthusiastic in
declaring him to be a clever actor
this is one of the superficial hin-
drances of devoting your time and
talents to straight parts

  so important a thing is personality
when bearing upon the work of an
actor that it is of interest to note that
many of the worlds most famous
dramatists from the early greek
days have written some of their big-
gest roles around the personality of
some popular actor or actress or
with certain actors in mind for par-
ticular parts

  if you have read any of the plays
of sophocles you will discover that
the part of cedipus which appears in
three successive plays was prepared


the green book album

for a certain star performer on the
stage of dionysus



  william shakespeare himself of-
ten wrote parts with a certain actor
in his minds eye for example the
parts of launce in two gentle-
men of verona and launcelot
gobbo in merchant of venice evi-
dently were written for the same co-
median they are strikingly similar
in characterization and temperament
it is likewise obvious that the parts
of mercutio and gratiano were
written for and entrusted to the same
actor

  moliere the famous french writer
for the stage was himself an actor
a reading of his printed works will
fail of perfect understanding if you
do not discover that his entire scheme
of character creation was based on
the idea that he wrote many of his
plays for the same group of players
being a player himself it was an im-
portant part of molieres concern that
he fit himself and his associated play-
ers with suitable parts analysis of
his plays readily proves this to be so


  to modernize the idea and illus-
trate exactly what is meant suppose
that our own augustus thomas in
writing his great play the witching
hour had named his principal char-
acter john mason instead of jack
brookfield it is evident that mr
thomas had mr mason in mind
when he wrote the part he appre-
ciated that the suave reserve of mr
masons acting and his personality
were fitted for such a role

  in queen annes day the dram-
atists in writing their plays wrote
many characters with colley cibber
the foremost actor of his day in
mind

  victorien sardou the modern
french writer has become best
known as the dramatist of sarah
bernhardt such well-known parts as
fedora gismonda la tosca
and zoraya were all written by
sardou with the divine sarah in
mind



  edmond rostand it is said wrote
cyrano de bergerac with the famous
comedian coquelin as the model on
which he based the part laiglon
it is said was also originally intended
for coquelins use but in the writing
of the play this was changed they
tell a story in this connection that
may be of interest

  coquelin who was a friend of the
dramatist asked rostand to write a
play in which coquelin could play
the part of one of those tremendous
grenadiers of napoleons army ros-
tand pointed out to coquelin that if
they wrote the play around events
during the lifetime of the great gen-
eral the part of napoleon would
overshadow that of the grenadier so
rostand proposed that they take the
period in history immediately fol-
lowing napoleon and concern them-
selves with the life of the feeble due
de reichstadt



  rostand set to work but before
he had proceeded far he found that
whether he wished it or no his theme
was developing so that the little due
became the dominating figure of the
drama making the part of the grena-
dier of secondary importance the
dramatist told coquelin of this and
the actor readily enough suggested
that inasmuch as bernhardt wanted
to play a boy the piece be turned
over to her and so it was that the
play which was started for coquelin
became one of the greatest triumphs
of bernhardt
personality



  coquelin did not appear in laig-
lon in france his firot appearance
in the role of the grenadier was made
in america when the piece was pre-
sented at the garden theatre in new
york

  sir arthur wing pinero is said to
have written the part of paula tan-
queray with mrs patrick campbell
in mind it is a certainty that the per-
sonality of the character closely fol-
lowed the personality of mrs camp-
bell and that the role fitted her
better than anything she had ever
done

  to refer to a contemporary eng-
lish dramatist mr henry arthur
jones has undoubtedly written many
of the parts in his plays with the per-
sonality of sir charles wyndham in
mind mr jones has written many
parts those of well-bred clean-cut
men of the world who have experi-
enced all that the world has to give
them and who are at home in any so-
ciety it is in such parts that sir
charles has been most successful for
he is of that type of man and his
personality fits the parts or the parts
fit his personality whichever way
you prefer having it



  who is there that questions the
truth of the statement that beau
brummel was written with a due re-
gard to the personality of the late
mr richard mansfield if there was
ever a part that was written for a
particular individual it was beau
brummel

  joseph jefferson was so identified
with the part of rip in rip van
winkle that there cannot pos-
sibly be two opinions that it was a
question of the actors personality
allied with a role that in itself was
weak and lacking in dramatic value
yet through the exercise of sheer
personality mr jefferson made this

role one of the most notable on our
stage

  if such famous dramatists as those
found it advisable to write their char-
acters with the personality of some
particular individual in mind it is
fair to assume that the personality of
the actor is what makes him notable
in his day and generation



  we have mentioned that it is a dif-
ficult matter to play straight parts
and that it is a comparatively easy
matter to play character parts
this is true but it is also true that
the wonderful character acting of
many of our famous stars is a dif-
ficult task no one would be brash
enough to place the abilities of such
noted actors as james a herne rob-
ert b mantell and richard mans-
field on the same plane as those of
the average work-a-day actor who
essays the character parts that
come along in the course of the aver-
age play these men were essentially
creators of character they did not
play them but notwithstanding all
this it was because of their dominant
personalities that they were able to
so identify themselves with these
roles that each became known as the
particular actor who was best known
in a particular part



  clyde fitch was always famous for
the number of small character parts
he wrote in his plays so many and
so clever were these parts known as
bits in the language of the stage
that many obscure actors have
gained recognition through appear-
ing in only one part but a following
up of the professional careers of such
hits developed the surprising fact
that the actor who was so success-
ful in the character part of so-and-


the green book album

so in such-and-such a play dropped
out of sight and back into the pond
of mediocrity they were accidents
of a good part and because they

lacked personality they did not ad-
vance

  it is the same with many worthy
actors who become stars because of
the hit they have made in some part
but once they assume stardom and
have a different and vastly more dif-
ficult part to play they cannot make
good and are set down as one more
of the army of failures the chances
are the part in which they made their
acidental hit just happened to suit
their individual physical and mental
make-up but they made the mistake
of thinking that one swallow makes
a summer-that one good part makes
an actor



  in discussing personality it is well
to remember that we do not judge a
person as we would a statue by
lines and curves but primarily by
the power to do and to impress him-
self upon other people on this
basis it is quite likely that we would
have to rule out the charming ver-
satile actress or the graceful mod-
ern woman of the stage who can
read lines well and wear becoming
gowns and put in her place the quiet
mother of a family who is gifted
with personality-a personality that
would make her unique and distinc-
tive



  in the writers own experience he
has often heard it said that he does
not act it is true that i always ap-
pear in my own person it has been
said that i have personality if i
have i am mighty thankful the
critics of my work have probably
made the same criticism of me that
they have of such actors as john
drew-that i merely play myself

  i consider that i am doing fairly
well if i am able to appear in new
plays year after year and entertain
audiences for two hours in parts that
do not require me to attempt to hide
my identity behind a set of bushy
whiskers or make-up as an old man
of the sea and come on the stage
leaning on a staff

  inasmuch as women go to make
up by far the greater proportion of
our theatre audiences it is evident
that the actor who is most success-
ful in impressing his personality up-
on the feminine contingent is the one
who will be the most successful
women by nature are more in-
clined to be inattentive in the
theatre they go to the theatre
not so much to see this play or that
play but rather to relax and be en-
tertained audiences do not want to
be edified they seek true amuse-
ment-laughter sympathy terror
and tears the mot successful actors
are those who give their audiences
these things in the best measure



  have you ever stopped to consider
that the drama is the only art ex-
cepting oratory and certain forms of
music that is designed to appeal to
a crowd instead of to the individual
i might appear in my play before an
audience consisting of my one best
friend and i would fail in my pur-
pose a play requires a crowd of peo-
ple for its perfect understanding and
enjoyment there is a bond between
the man behind the footlights and
the people in the auditorium there-
fore a play must have a crowd

  the poet writes for himself and
for such other selected individuals
throughout the world as may be
sympathetic enough to understand
his musings the novelist and essay-
ist write for a single reader sitting
alone it is the same with painting
personality



and sculpture though a painting or
a picture may be seen by thousands
its appeal is always made to an in-
dividual mind

  a play is essentially a story to be
presented by actors on a stage be-
fore an audience so it must necessa-
rily be designed to appeal at once to
a multitude of people you have to
sit alone to appreciate the venus of
melos or the sistine madonna or
the egoist but carrying out my
previous thought who could sit alone
in a theatre and enjoy a performance
of cyrano de bergerac

  this being so it seems simple
enough to hold that the actor who
appeals to a crowd must be gifted
with personality

  it is the possession of personality
that makes possible the definition i
once heard applied to the two types

of theatrical stars one type is the
star for a season-probably the re-
sult of a good part or of sufficient
money to exploit himself the other
type is the well-seasoned star-the
actor who has in himself the person-
ality and ability that rises above the
limitations of any one particular role
the well-seasoned star is the one
who visits your city season after
season and generally without re-
gard to the play he may have enlists
your interest and support

  before you can achieve much in
the drama you must have those at-
tributes that give character and in-
dividuality to the actor so that he
in his own person is different and
distinguished from all others

  without it you are nil with it
other things being equal everything
is possible to the earnest man

chapter i

with his back to ttie wall

there is no alternative harold
you must pawn your fur-lined
overcoat

  these dread words fell from the pal-
lid lips of katherine dogstory the wife
of the famous theatrical press-agent as
she faced her husband in the privacy of
their little harlem flat a chill day in
october the lines of her countenance

were tense and drawn she faltered in
her speech but bravely continued
while harold staggered against the wall
and gasped

  impossible-

  what else can we do demanded
katherine tenderly nursing the little
pomeranian pup which shared their flat
with them and which alas was even
then whining with hunger the
butcher has cut off all credit the rent
is long since due and even the bologna


the fur-lined overcoat



sausage which you quietly appropriated
at the free lunch counter of the friars
last night has been exhausted what
else can we do

  harold dogstory pale emaciated
out of work forced a sickly smile as he
strove to encourage his devoted wife

  t have been intending to go on a
diet anyhow he murmured true it
is a bad theatrical season so far com-
panies have busted in every direction
and i havent found even one chorus
girl who can afford to pay to get her
pictures in the papers but never mind
something is sure to turn up soon and
then i will be on easy street

  and meanwhile-

  we must endure every privation
sooner than part with my celebrated
fur-lined overcoat why that is the
badge of my trade-my uniform  what
sort of a press-agent would i be if i
failed to own a fur-lined overcoat the
boys at the friars club would laugh at
me in scorn and then i should never get
a real engagement as a press-agent
still as the weather is quite warm now
it might be possible to hock the benny
for a few days and hope for the best

  katherine dogstorys eyes lit up with
pleasure in anticipation of seeing a few
dollars of real money for times had in-
deed been hard in the dogstory estab-
lishment and clients for the press bu-
reau had shown a regular delinquency
regarding money matters though will-
ing to promise fabulous sums in advance
for publicity they desired through har-
old

  tenderly she turned toward the
closet an odor of moth-balls permeated
the atmosphere as she opened the door
with loving hands she lifted the old fur
overcoat from the hanger shook out the
moth-balls and held it toward the light

  a trifle worn in spots she re-
marked showing the good service it
has rendered it needs a curry-comb
badly and i am afraid it is threatened
with the mange still i dare say you
can borrow a few dollars on it from the
worthy pawn-broker

  harold sighed sadly as he threw the
overcoat over his arm and started to-
ward the door

  good-by old friend he murmured

affectionately you have been through
many campaigns with me you have
been in the forefront of the battle line
when all the press-agents in their fur
coats stormed the citadels of the editors
you have never failed me vet come
and well see if i can soak you for ten
dollars 

chapter ii

the great english actress

  you sent for me madame

  the speaker is harold dogstory the
press-agent and the time is three days
after the events narrated in our last
chapter

  the scene is the boudoir of olga
oversoul the great english actress
who only the day before had landed
upon these shores to begin her farewell
tour of america

  miss oversoul proudly patrician in-
tensely aesthetic keenly artistic subtly
temperamental reclined in her great
easy chair and calmly surveyed our hero
through half-closed eyelids

  yes she whispered after an embar-
rassing pause be seated mr dog-
story madge ring for some tea and
marmalade she added turning to her
faithful attendant and secretary

  harold seated himself opposite the
beautiful actress and put his hat under
the chair ah how he regretted the ab-
sence of that fur-lined overcoat with
which to make a stunning impression
upon this haughty beauty who had sum-
moned him for a business talk

  with a real fur coat i could boost
my salary fifty a week he murmured
sadly

  but hush-the great actress is speak-
ing

  you have been highly recommended
to me mr dogstory said miss over-
soul as a keen and brilliant press-
agent who can devise new stories even
day t want sensational things yet not
a line must be printed that is not dig-
nified always remember that you are
representing miss oversoul whom the
critics have kindly called the sarah
bernhardt of the english stage

  i shall never forget it even in my
sleep bowed harold


the green book album

  with a few notes of interest which
my secretary will hand you continued
the great actress you should be able
to do very well you are therefore en-
gaged at a salary of-shall we say a
hundred 

  i had thought of a hundred and
twenty-five-began harold but a
warning look in the great ladys eyes
caused him to add hastily but i will
accept the hundred

  a few instructions from the vigilant
secretary a pleasant chat with the ac-
tress about stories which must not be
used under any circumstances and our
hero rose and prepared to take his
departure

  you will leave for  hicago to-mor-
row added miss oversoul rising as if
to terminate the interview my sec-
retary will furnish your transportation
and-merciful heavens 

  harold stood transfixed as the actress
suddenly cried out in alarm

  you have no overcoat she de-
clared yet it is snowing

  -i-that is- stammered harold
uneasily

  the actress stopped him with an im-
perious gesture

  of course you have a fur-lined
overcoat she demanded i never yet
had a press-agent who didnt possess at
least one

  of course- harold struggled
manfully to explain

  oh then thats all right i could
never think of beginning my engage-
ment in a city unless my press-agent
stood in the lobby wearing a fur-lined
overcoat to make an impression upon
people as he is my courier my ad-
vance agent so he must make an im-
pression upon people worthy of myself
however i am pleased to learn that you
have this very necessary requisite for
the distinguished calling which you are
now following and now mr dog-
story good-morning

  outside harold reeled against a
lamp-post and clutched it for support
he felt dizzy

  i put the bluff through all right he
said to himself but how in thunder
can i get the coat out of hock until i
draw my first weeks salary

chapter iii

  wiiere the lake breezes blow

  take in my card to the dramatic
editor please

  these words were uttered in a calm
commanding voice by a pale slender
young man neatly attired in a dark
business suit which was evidently left
over from year before last under his
arm he carried a large bundle carefully
wrapped in brown paper it might have
contained photographs but the office
boy in the ante-room of the great chi-
cago daily eyed it suspiciously

  aw yer gotter write yer name and
business on this card

  harold dogstory drew himself up
proudly beneath the studied insolence of
the menial

  my card to the editor at once he
repeated i am harold dogstory the
press-agent for miss oversoul the
great english actress and i am here on
business with your dramatic editor
the boy looked at the young man so
inconspicuously dressed and not even
boasting an overcoat though the day
was one of winters worst then he
laughed

  aw gwan you aint no press-
agent he sneered youse a book
agent or some cheap skate but you aint
no press-agent why all the press-
agents from the theatres always wears
fur overcoats

  stung to the quick by this truthful
retort indignant at being taunted by a
mere hireling harold dogstory was
about to make an angry answer when the
elevator stopped and a pompous some-
what stout individual clad in a great
fur-lined overcoat of expensive appear-
ance stepped out harold turned his
head quickly to avoid being seen for he
instantly recognized the face and fur
overcoat of philip bungle the rotund
press-agent who was in chicago in the
interests of trixie lightfoot the music-
al comedy star who was also scheduled
to open her chicago engagement on the
same night miss oversoul planned to
inaugurate her american tour

  so then the two rivals were face to
face now mark how easily the tide of
battle could be turned
the fur-lined overcoat



  my card to mr uplift the dramatic
editor said philip bungle easily hand-
ing- the urchin a card i believe he is
expecting me

  yassir grinned the office boy
come right in sir first door to the
right

  and as philip bungle the rival press-
agent walked into the editorial sanctum
and greeted uriah uplift the dramatic
editor harold dogstory cowered in the
corner thanking his lucky stars that he
had not been humiliated by being recog-
nized for in happier days gone by he
had put philip bungles best efforts to
shame and there was a deadly rivalry
between these two soldiers of publicity
to be seen without his much-prized fur
overcoat and by a rival wearing a gor-
geous new outer garment was too great
a humiliation and harold was glad he
had not been seen as he turned toward
the elevator the office boy cried out

  a press-agent huh-that was a
real theatrical press-agent who just
went in-the guy wid de fur overcoat

chapter iv

a thief in the night

time to make the rounds smith

  the clerk of the hotel windy in chi-
cago sleepily nodded to the night watch-
man who looked at the clock saw that
it was three in the morning and obe-
diently started toward the elevator

  from floor to floor the faithful night
watchman patrolled the corridors ring-
ing in his call boxes to record his tour

  on the ninth floor crouching behind
a door which was only opened a hairs-
breadth was a tense eager figure as
the watchman passed the waiting
crouching form almost stopped breath-
ing then as all danger disappeared
and the watchman turned the corner of
the corridor the door opened harold
dogstory stepped forth

  in one hand he held a bundle of skel-
eton keys-in the other a small bottle
of chloroform and a handkerchief

  stealthily he tip-toed down the cor-
ridor to a room which he had marked
with a piece of chalk earlier in the day

trying one key after another mean-

while glancing furtively up and down
the corridor to make sure he was not
being observed he trembled with nerv-
ous anxiety until at last a kev turned
in the lock

  noiselessly slowlv he opened the
door

  from within came the sounds of
heavy breathing and at intervals a
snore whoever occupied the room was
asleep

  quickly adjusting the handkerchief
over the bottle of chloroform the in-
truder saturated the bit of cambric with
the deadly drug then in three seconds
he was at the bedside of the sleeper

  in another moment the chloroform
had done its work the victim slept
without snoring there was a relaxa-
tion of the muscles and harold dog-
story quickly placed the handkerchief
and bottle in his pocket he had no wish
to kill his victim

  flashing a pocket electric lamp
around the room the intruder quickly
saw what he was after with a sudden
plunge he grabbed a fur-lined overcoat
from a clothes-tree and threw it over
his arm

  sleep philip bungle he murmured
in adieu at the door sleep well to-
night for to-morrow something may
worry you so that you cannot sleep at
all

  alone in his room harold dogstory
held aloft with both hands the precious
treasure for which he had become a
thief in the night and then as he fondly
caressed the great fur coat which had
been philip bungles he cried a la
monte cristo

  the world is mine

chapter v

turning the tables

  a trifle loose but it will do

  so saying harold dogstory surveyed
himself in the stolen fur overcoat as
he stood before the cheval glass in his
room and felt the warm heavy folds
of the glossy fur cling to his slender
frame

  and now to work and undo all that
philip bungle accomplished yesterday


the greek book album

   in the office where on the day before
he hail been treated with such contempt
he faced an obsequious office boy who
did not recognize in this splendid rai-
ment the man whom he had ejected
from the office the day before

  yessir ill take your card in right
away sir he cried in awe come
right with me sir-mr uplift will sure
be glad to see you sir

  uriah uplift dramatic editor and
first aid to every new movement in the
dramatic world greeted our hero cor-
dially on his desk was a bundle of
photos of trixie light foot and these
harold cleverly contrived to knock into
the wastebasket as he spread out his
own wares before the dramatic editor

  yes i am a great admirer of miss
oversoul admitted the dramatic edi-
tor i had intended to use pictures of
miss lightfoot brought in by your able
confrere mr bungle only yesterday
but as he has failed to keep a luncheon
engagement he made with me for one
oclock to-day i shall leave his pictures
in the wastebasket where they have so
providentially fallen

  harold ever ready to grasp an op-
portunity was not slow to realize on
this one

  if you will lunch with me at my ho-
tel mr uplift he said grandly we
can talk matters over more leisurely
may i have the honor

  as the dramatic editor and the press-
agent passed into the ante-room the
elevator paused and a stout individual
minus an overcoat stepped out hurried-
ly scarcely noticing them the new-
comer who was none other than philip
bungle dashed to the office boy

   i am a trifle late he gasped tell
mr uplift i am here

   mr uplift aint in retorted the of-
fice boy sullenly there he goes down
in the elevator now-hes going out to
lunch with a theatrical press-agent-
that guy in the fur overcoat

  and even as the car descended philip
bungle recognized our hero resplen-
dent in a gray fur coat and heard him
say casually to the dramatic editor
awful bore isnt it to have to meet
so many of these advance agents in
your office so much nicer to have a

little lunch away from such pests
there i can tell you all about miss
oversoul and her new and wonderful

play

chapter vi

our hero gets his reward

harold you have done splendid

work

  so spoke olga oversoul in her pri-
vate suite at her hotel the day after she
had so successfuly inaugurated her am-
erican tour

  and what a splendid fur overcoat
you are wearing really i am quite
proud of you

  olga oversoul had good reason to be
proud of her press-agent not only had
he landed pictures galore in all the pa-
pers through the magic talisman of his
fur overcoat which had been the open
sesame to all editorial sanctuaries but
the very success scored by him had been
the death-blow to the struggles of phil-
ip bungle

  for without a fur-lined overcoat
philip bungle had been unable to obtain
the entree to any of the newspaper of-
fices year after year the real press-
agents had come to these offices in an
endless procession all wearing expen-
sive fur coats for an agent to attempt
to scale these newspaper gibraltars
without a fur coat was as futile as to
shoot an arrow against the great rock
itself and so philip bungle had failed
hopelessly and ignominiously anti
trixie lightfoot had opened in her mu-
sical comedy without any newspa-
per showing in advance and to only
half a house while across the street
olga oversoul had scored a triumph
before a capacity audience

  small wonder then that in her gen-
erous heart of hearts she was willing
to concede some of the credit to her
press-agent

  what a splendid fur coat but isnt
it too large for you 

  harold turned toward her suddenly
she smiled something in her eyes told
him that he dared to tell the truth
-an innovation a press-agent seldom
ventures to introduce

and then as the full realization of his
the fur-lined overcoat



trickery came over him he confessed
at first seriously then as the humor of
the affair struck him with variations
he described his own sad fur coat still
in hock in new york the envy aroused
by this other coat and the keen rivalry
between the two press-agents and final-
ly his theft

  and now he said dramatically
now that i have attained the purpose
for which i stole the coat i shall re-
turn it to its rightful owner

  calling a messenger boy harold
wrote a brief note unsigned to philip
bungle and dispatched the faithful
benny to its owner

  olga oversoul touched to the quick
by this spirit of honesty proud and
happy in her own success was filled
with a feeling of admiration for our
hero

  go forth at once to the leading fur-
rier of the town she cried imperiously
and pick out for yourself the best fur-

lined overcoat they have in stock bid
the tradesmen send the bill to me har-
old dogstory for you are too good a
press-agent to be handicapped by the
absence of a press-agents chief tool of
trade quick harold so the reporters
will be sure to see you in a fur overcoat
in the lobby to-night

  it was a good old dog mused har-
old dogstory as he thought of the fur
coat of his enemy and rubbed his own
mink-lined garment proudly his was
only made from the skin of a shaggy-
brute but it made a great impression
these cheap coats like philip bungles
are made from st bernard dog skins
they are the dogs that go forth in
storms to rescue alpine travelers who
have fainted from weariness i surely
was down and out and ready to quit
when philip bungles st bernard dog
came along just in time to rescue me
yes it was a good dog

we were doing the common-
wealth stunt our manager
having flew the coop in the
last town leaving us stranded we
decided to go on to the next town
which had been billed announcing
the coming of the metropolitan
stock company in a repertoire of
high-class modern plays and play
it on the commonwealth plan none
of us ever remembered having
heard of the town much less seen it
however

  this particular monday morning
a few years ago found us and our
trunks dumped off at a little two-by-
four station called warren maine
geographically it is a very few miles
inland from rockland but really
that is as far as we were concerned
it is several hundred miles from any-
where

  at one end of the platform stood a
ramshackle old carry-all attached to
which was a pair of seedy-looking
mules driving it was a red-whisk-


opera house to-night



ered dried up wizened looking man
with a skin for all the world like
parchment as we approached him
something resembling a human voice
said carry yawl up fer quarter
apiece

  how far is it asked lando
our heavy man little bettern three
mile croaked the red whiskers now
we knew every one of us men and
women that all we had in the treas-
ury the same being the character
mans wilsons pocket was one
dollar and sixty cents after pooling
all our money and buying the trans-
portation and paying the hotel bills
thats all we had

  if experience counted for anything
we were all millionaires

  now it doesnt take much knowl-
edge of high finance to know that it
is utterly impossible to carry nine
people and five trunks at a quarter
a-piece on one dollar-sixty

  so after a very brief consultation
we decided loud enough for the red
whiskers to hear that wed rather
walk we needed the exercise any-
how and picking up our suit-cases
we started leaving wilson who has
the most persuasive tongue in the
world to dicker with the red whisk-
ers about hauling the trunks the red
whiskers agreed to haul them up to
the opry house for a dollar well
we struggled into the village who-
ever called it a town why the total
population didnt exceed four hun-
dred  and made for the hotel at least
thats what folks called it there-
abouts and indeed was not comraer-
mercial hotel painted the whole
length of it it was one of those new
england frame buildings in which
you climb up a flight of stairs to
reach the ground floor

  we trooped into the office and
turned to the left into the ladies
parlor we could have done that
with our eyes shut we had been in
scores like it everybody dropped

grips and the ladies dropped into di-
lapidated old-fashioned chairs while
the men went out to register but
nary a register did we find cause
why  there was no register to regis-
ter in

 in a few moments the landlord
oozed into the office oozed is
right for it was a sweltering hot day
and the landlord was a man of enor-
mous girth our three-mile walk
along a dusty road had done its work
well with us the landlord evidently
sized us up right for between asth-
matic gasps he exploded these kind
words be you show folks you
dont look it look more like gyp-
sies want to stay here how long
somebody ventured something about
a week you do eh well yell hev
to pay in advance show troupe here
last fall and they didnt make enough
ter buy stamps to send home
fer money-couldnt pay their board
no siree yer cant stay here thout
yer pay in advance

  of course this was absolutely out
of the question and we told him so
mind you we didnt say we couldnt-
we simply said we wouldnt how-
ever no amount of argument would
move him so the heavy man sug-
gested we go to the opera house
land lay out our stuff for the night
show

  this was not only a good idea but
it was the best and only thing we
could do so the landlord being good
enough to direct us we picked up
our grips and walked off to the opera
house

  it was little more than a bam from
the outside and from the inside it
was a little less at one end was the
stage with a dressing room each
side the stage was built about three
feet from the floor the dressing
rooms were on a level with the floor
with three narrow little steps on
the down stage side for the actors
use when they made an entrance if


the green book album

when you made an exit you were not
very careful you would drop into the
dressing room very suddenly

  the stage was equipped with a
front curtain-one of those that roll
up from the bottom-a set of reversi-
ble wings painted kitchen on one
side and pea-green foliage on the
other and on the back wall was
painted a window and a door that
and the kitchen wings formed the
only interior set back stage near the
wall hung a wood drop this and the
wood wings represented the one and
only exterior set hanging from the
ceiling in the center was a roches-
ter lamp that stood for border lights
along the front of the stage set a
half-dozen bracket lamps with tin re-
flectors these were the footlights
and many a time in similar places
have i seen the swish of a womans
gown put out the whole business in
front of the stage stood an old organ
with two stops neither of which had
the slightest control over its wheezy
interior this was the orchestra the
seats-there were twelve rows-were
just plain ordinary pine benches the
first four rows were the reserved
they had backs to them while the
rest were just plain seats back of
these and above the front entrance
in fact the only entrance was the
gallery this was reached by means
of a sort of jacobs ladder and was
only used by boys when you got up
there you discovered one long bench
-in fact the whole gallery was just
a narrow shelf

  the one man about the place was
manager carpenter light-man props
and everything else his daughter a
girl of about fifteen was the musical
director no apologies to will cressy
and his town hall to-night the
manager etc informed us that with
a couple of passes for the show he
could get us a table and chairs and
mebbe a sofy

  fine said wilson who was also

our stage manager get us four cups
and saucers and four plates and
knives and forks and ill give you
four passes

  gosh says the manager etc
etc be ye goin ter eat real meals
on the stage

  sure says wilson heres your
passes and hurry up with the stuff
cause weve got a rehearsal before
the show this talk about eating had
its effect on us all we hadnt eaten
anything since early morning so we
looked at wilson we knew he had
sixty cents left after paying for haul-
ing the trunks so the heavy woman
and she was that in more ways than
one said whats the matter with
eating now im hungry cant we get
something to eat in this god-forsaken
burg with that sixty cents

  not a whole lot you can bank on
that said wilson but anyhow ill
get what i can in the meantime-
speaking to the men-you fellows
better get out and dodger the town
we had a few hundred dodgers left
over from the last town printed like
this

opera house to-night
an actors romance


 and 
up-to-date specialties

  you see they could be used in any
town as they were absolutely non-
committal as to place or date

  these we dug out of the prop
trunk and started out-lando the
heavy corthell the comedian wal-
lace the old man and myself we
split up at the post-office each go-
ing in a different direction pushing
the bills into the hands of everyone
we passed and slipping them under
front doors

  it didnt take long one man could
have done the whole town in a
half hour in much less time than
that we were all back again at the
opera house where we found wil-
opera house to-night



son dishing out canned salmon and
dry bread to the ladies

  after filling ourselves up with these
delicacies we felt ready for anything
-that is we all did except landos
wife the heavy woman she wanted
to know where we slept that night if
the show didnt make enough money
to pay the hotel bill in advance

  heres where i got in my fine
work say said i whats the mat-
ter with camping out theres a
dandy spot right across the river-
big pine trees and the needles thick
on the ground a regular natural car-
pet lets go over there and make
wigwams ill show you how to make
em

  i had had some experience in the
canadian woods having attached
myself to a government survey party
when i was a youngster and having
learned quite a few of the woodmans
tricks

  that listens fine says wilson
but can the women stand it

  sure i said why not youre
all four married couples and im the
only single one of the bunch but if
i was married i think id try and
make it comfortable for the girl even
if i couldnt do any better than a
shack in the woods come on theres
no reason why we shouldnt have a
bully time

  i felt it in my bones that we
wouldnt get much money out of this
town and to walk home with four
women trailing along was out of the
question so there was nothing to it
but camp out

  so while everybody else took an
after-dinner snooze in whichever posi-
tion he or she felt most comfortable
i took a walk along the river i hadnt
gone far before i spied a man sitting
in a flat-bottomed boat he was leis-
urely filling the cracks with pine tar
to keep it from leaking gee i
said to myself if we can borrow that
old scow to take us across the camp

things a cinch so i walked down
to the river-bank and said hello
howdy said he demed hot aint
it

  i agreed with him that it was but
i didn t care to talk about the
weather i couldnt alter that i was
scouting around in my mind as to
how i could get the use of that boat
i finally determined to broach the
subject anyway so i started with
are you going to the show to-
night

  nope he answered costs too
demed much

  considering that our prices were
ten twenty and thirty cents i began
to wonder just how much this son of
the soil would think ought to be the
price of admission i guess about
nothing well i said i guess i
could get you a pass in to see the
show free if-

  that if just narrowly saved him
from jumping clean out of the boat
in his delight at the thought of get-
ting something for nothing for if
theres anything in the world that will
bring joy to the new england rural
soul it is getting something for noth-
ing

  if you will let me have your boat
for a little while this evening i said
ill get you a pass it wont cost you
a cent to see the best show that ever
struck this town how about it
gosh dern it its a go when do
yer want it

  to-night where do you keep it
right here its alius tied to that
pine stump all yer got ter do is un-
tie it and pull it in ter shore

  fine if you come up to-night ill
get you a pass-or never mind
heres a bit of paper ill write one
now

  i tore the back off an envelope and
began to write when in chimed my
friend

  say kin yer make it fer two my
mothers stuck on show-actin


the green book album

  sure i said something told me
mother might be useful

  i gave him the pass for two and
turned back toward the opera house
and as it was getting dusk i guessed
it must be pretty nearly time for me
to get into my make-up as i was on
soon after the opening

  well the night came and we gave
as good a performance as we could
under the circumstances but as far
as the audience was concerned you
could have fired a cannon up the cen-
ter of the house and you wouldnt
hit a soul our total receipts were
four dollars and ten cents after split-
ting that seventy-thirty our share
was something like two eighty-seven

  of course we all realized we were
up against it and up against it
good and hard but nevertheless it
was not altogether without humor
everybody in the company laughed
they couldnt help it it was grim
humor but still it was funny hence
the laugh

  herby corthell shouted through his
cold-creamy face say rex what
about that camp thing does it come
off

  sure i said ive got it all fixed

  i	knew it was up to me to make
good now whenever you fellows are
ready well make for it right away
you lando borrow that axe from
the woodbox over there in the corner
well need that and wallace you
and wilson commandeer a couple of
those footlights well need those
too

  in a few minutes we were all head-
ing for the place where i knew the
boat was tied and sure enough there
it was but there was also about
twenty feet of mud space between us
and the boat and more beyond that
it was low tide and-well there was
a laugh on me that echoed and re-
echoed across that dinky river but i
wasnt stuck even if the boat was i
took off my shoes and socks and

rolled my pants up over my knees
untied the rope and waded out
through that mud to the boat then
pushed it on out to clear water now
you fellows i shouted back you
take off your shoes and carry the girls
pick-a-back out here and ill row
them over two at a time after a lot
of guying and laughing we all got
across but believe me it was as near
hard work as you would want to get
lando would never believe his wife
was a heavy woman until that
night he always thought she ought
to be playing leads but now he
guessed heavies was right i started
at work on the wigwams right away
for the benefit of those who dont
quite get me i will explain how
they are made who knows it might
come in handy for you to understand
the art of making wigwams you
commence by drawing the tops of
three young saplings toward each
other and tie them fast there you
have the frame of your wigwam all
ready then top off a lot of hemlock
branches and lay them shingle fash-
ion with the butts up against the
saplings until two sides are com-
pletely covered and there you have
a roof that it will take some rain-
storm to beat through then cut the
ends off some more branches and
pile them inside on the ground about
a foot deep and there you have a
bed that for sleeping purposes cant
be beaten in the world

  we were just about to start on the
second one after having given lan-
do and his wife a clear title to their
new home when all of a sudden-
holy sufferin look there we
all looked in the direction indicated
by corthells fat finger

  if that aint the opera house
burning up im a liar said he

  it looks like it said wilson and
our trunks in it can you beat that for
luck

  well whats the use of standing
opera house to-night



here looking at it i said weve
got to do something maybe we can
get our trunks out of it anyway we
might be able to save them all right
come on wilson lets go and wil-
son and i waded back through that
mud to the boat and maybe we didnt
do some tall rowing up that river
we were going some believe me
as we got nearer what little breath
we had came easier anyhow for in-
stead of it being the opera house it
was a house that stood near it

  well we might as well stick for
the big show says wilson lets
go and see if we cant do something
so we landed and went on up to the
fire by this time the fire-bell which
by the way wasnt a bell at all but
an old steel rim off a locomotive
wheel being struck with a sledge-
hammer had brought out every soul
in the town all yelling for the fire
engine and presently it came i wish
you could have seen it-an antiquated
affair that bad long handles running
along each side which manned by
twenty or thirty men and boys con-
stituted the pumping apparatus

  somehow or other the hose refused
to become untangled so wilson who
loudly proclaimed having been a fire-
man at home in roxbury mass be-
gan to stage-manage the whole thing
he got on top of that old engine and
without coat or hat with bare feet
and legs he looked a sight in fact
we were a couple of sights between
us we managed to get the intake hose
down into the river and wilson
yelled now pump you sons of
guns and they did for all they
were worth i had command of the
nozzle directing the stream where it
could do the most good and in a very
short time we had the fire out all
this had its effect on the people for
you could hear say them show
fellers are all right-them show
fellers are the beatenest-that fel-
ler on the engines been a fireman

all right-say if twasnt fer them
acter fellers jim hopkins place
would a burned clean up and so
on ad lib the men and women
crowded around us patting us on the
back and wilson says though i dont
believe it that several of the girls
kissed him-be that as it may

  however one man who afterwards
proved to be the mayor and practical
owner of the town asked us what
do you play to-morrow night we
didn t know that we were going to
play anything but fatheaded wilson
had to say ingomar can you
imagine ingomar on that stage

  all right says the mayor
where are you staying in those
pine trees over there i said point-
ing across the river

  oh that wont do said the
mayor why dont you come up to
my house ive got plenty of room
ill send up and get jenny meaning
his housekeeper to get some supper
ready will you come

  would we come during the prog-
ress of the invitation wilson looked
as if he had suddenly become an
apoplectic

  would we come it didnt take
long to convince the mayor that we
were more than willing but we
must go across the river and get the
rest of the company

  i	told him how we were sort of up
against it how our manager had
skipped etc etc well the upshot of
it was that three other boats were
pressed into service by our new-
found friend and in a short time we
were all sitting around a real table
on real chairs in a regular house
having the feast of our lives the
mayors larder suffered that night
believe me we slept that night in
feather beds although i am primitive
enough to prefer the hemlock next
morning while wilson and i were
walking down to the postoffice a red-
headed boy pushed a hand-bill to-
the green book album

ward us we each took one and

read

opera house to-night

fire heroes

in

a sensational comedy-drama
ingomar

come one come all
prices
c and c
under the personal patronage of

john - mayor

  well wilson looked at me and i
looked at wilson then we both
stood there and laughed like a couple
of blithering idiots whats the sen-
sational comedy-drama rex said
he

  why ingomar you fathead i
replied what the devil did you say
that for you know we couldnt put
that on even if we were up in it
which were not

  oh well said wilson well
give them an actors romance
again they wont know the differ-
ence

  this was really the only play in
our repertoire that we could put on
with the stuff we had as all the rest
of the six plays required either cen-
ter door fancies or set rocks or
prison scene so we concluded that
the theatre-going public of warren

maine would have to put up with
what we could give them an ac-
tors romance

  that night the opera house was
packed even the dinky little gallery
was full i believe every one of war-
rens four hundred inhabitants were
there everything we did was re-
ceived uproariously

  the manager carpenter props and
lights donated the house and when
wilson counted up there was a hun-
dred and thirty-seven dollars and
twenty-five cents more money than
we had played to for at least two
moons

  we stayed at the house of our
friend the mayor that night and the
next morning saw us and our bag-
gage on a train bound for new york
with through tickets and eight dol-
lars apiece in our pockets almost the
entire village population were there
to see us off-which they did with
three cheers for the acter fellers

  this all happened some years ago
since then wilson lando corthell
and myself have climbed to more or
less dizzy heights on the theatrical
ladder of fame but if you ever want to
get a laugh out of any one of us when
we meet just say warren maine

 heating hopes realized

  mothers of the last gen-

   or dust into the rooms cleaning work is enormously reduced not only do they
   insure a clean home but american radiators are themselves easy to clean you

 have no rusty stove-pipes to put up and take down no
 stoves to black no registers to throw out dust or soot

  our radiators can be easily brush-cleaned and all patterns
  for kitchens laundries bath-rooms etc can be scrubbed
  like a kitchen floor they make for the clean and simple

  no-rim-cut tires

proved average oversize 

 goodyear no-rim-cut lires are advertised
 as  per cent oversize

 we claim that this oversize adds  per cent
 to the tire mileage

 the actual oversize over five leading makes
 was lately found to average  per cent

 note the table below

 oversize is not measured by calipers it is
 measured by air capacity air carries the load

 note that only three tires in these  com-
 parisons came within  per cent of our size

 thats because no-rim-cut tires have the
 hookless base your removable rim flanges
 with these tires turn outward instead of inward
 thus the tire has an extra flare

 each one per cent oversize means one per
 cent extra carrying capacity

 oversize means to save blow-outs-to increase
 tire mileage-to cut down tire expense

 yet these oversize tires which cant rim-cut
 now cost no more than other standard tires

last year

 the sale of good year tires exceeded the pre-
 vious  year put together

 we sold enough last year to completely equip
  cart

 no-rim-cut tires now far outsell any other
 type of tire

 just because these two features-no-rim-cut
 and oversize-cut tire bills right in two and
 tens of thousands of lasers have proved it

  no-rim-cut tires

 leading makers adopt them

  for the year igio  leading motor car makers
contracted for goodyear tires

  for the year   makers came to them

  for this year vve have contracts from the
makers of  leading cars

  that shows how car makers-the shrewdest
of experts-have come to the goodyear tires

  tires can never be made in our estimation
  better than goodyear tires of today

  as for users the demand in the past two
years has multiplied six times over

  tens of thousands of users have told tens of
thousands of others how their tire bills were
cut in two

 now more motor car owners buy these
patented tires than
any other tires in ex-
istence

 the saving

 no-rim-cut tires
are the final result of
 years spent in tire
making

  year after year we
have been constantly
learning by wearing
out tires on tire-test-
ing machines

 we have compared
in this way hundreds
of fabrics and formu-
las methods and proc-
esses until we knew
what was best

  then no-rim-cut tires make rim-cutting im-
  possible

  with old-type tires-clincher tires- per
  cent of all ruined tires are rim-cut

  all that ruin is saved-all that worry avoided
  -by the use of no-rim-cut tires

  even  per cent oversize under average
  conditions add s per cent to the tire mileage
  and our oversize as shown by the table averages
   per cent

  these two features together-no-rim-cut and
  oversize-under average conditions cut tire
  bills in two

cuticurasoap

  a generation of mothers has
found no soap so well suited for
cleansing and purifying the skin
and hair of infants and children
as cuticura soap its absolute
purity and refreshing fragrance
alone are enough to recommend it
above ordinary skin soaps but
there is added to these qualities a
delicate yet effective medication
derived from cuticura ointment
which renders it most valuable in
overcoming a tendency to distress-
ing eruptions irritations and chaf-
ings and in promoting a normal
condition of skin and hair health
