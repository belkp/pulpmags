   suppose you were a small-town girl engaged to a man whom the community
held in the highest regard and suppose out of a clear sky your one rich
relative sent you an utterly mad frilly bit of bright pink silk that only a new
yorker would dare to call a hat would you wear it in the local easter parade
even if you knew the whole town would not only be completely shocked but
would probably laugh at you charity lane decided after many misgivings
that she would take a chance because all of a sudden she knew something had
to be done to add a bright spot to her dull everyday existence and something
definitely bright was added if she hadnt worn the shocking-pink hat she never
would have met the man who wanted her to help him chase rainbows she dis-
covered that chasing rainbows was lots more fun than working in a tearoom
and being engaged to a stuffed shirt and dr tony nickels who was on his
way into the marines was the first man who ever made her feel she was beau-
tiful this is one of the gayest stories vina lawrence has ever written and
if you feel the need of a bright spot in your own life dont miss the
shocking-pink bonnet

-a ju to wal

  you wjt

by peggy montgomery

one of two men had saved nan
from utter oblivion by a kiss and
she would have willingly given
her life again for the one she
hoped it ivas

the landlady was voluble and in-
dignant if id known shed act
that way i wouldnt have let her
have the room

   the ambulance driver was curious
 who do you suppose she is

   the interne was curt businesslike
 oh no you dont youre going to stay
 awake if i have to-

   their voices came to nan through
 screens of sickening fog why couldnt
 they let her alone if she didnt want any
 more of life that was her business

   id sure like to know who she is
 the ambulance driver was not adverse to
 curly brown heads and long eyleshes

   dont ask me the landlady dis-
 claimed all responsibility i never set
 eyes on her before today she opened a
 traveling bag exposing its naked empti-
 ness did you ever i had a notion to
 make her pay in advance but she looked
 at me with them big sad eyes i sorta
 thought she was some girl whose boy
 friend had gone out on a convoy
 and left her stony the ambulance
 driver matched the landladys ire and
 raised it if she makes it ill take her
 home to mom shell-

   the good samaritan act wont be
 necessary the interne cut in shes
 some wealthy brat who couldnt take it
 because she wasnt asked to the right
 luncheon



   ill bet she aint ill bet shes some
 sailors sweetheart

   with this underwear feather hair-
cuts like this dont come out of five and
dimes either come on lets get her into
the ambulance

   the fog was thicker nan felt herself
lifted by hands which were skilled and
gentle but she was too sleepy to care
y y y y y y

and then nan was dancing with jere at least jere was dancing-nan was more like a sleep-walker

she would sleep in spite of the one who
was determined to keep her awake did
he think he was god  what right had he
to make her live to face a life of heart-
break and humiliation jilted the day be-
fore her wedding

  oh duke duke   

  but the hands wouldnt let her alone
there was a blessed lapse and then that
horrible sickness again nan had no con-
sciousness of the passage of time she had
no idea where she was she would not




new love magazine

live she pitted all her strength against
those persistent hands that coaxing voice
and then there were lips against hers
against her will nan felt a tremor in her
veins the flickering flame of her heart
steadied the will to die was slipping
from her under those lips it had lost its
strength again there was a lapse a void

now the nausea was gone with a sick-
ening surety nan knew she would
live would have to face the world a jilted
bride wearily she opened her eyes great
blue disks which looked up dully into the
haggard face of a blond young giant who
was bending over her bed with difficulty
they focussed on that face which was
whiter than her own

  oh nan darling the man said his
voice was breaking it sounded like duke
but it couldnt be duke didnt cry-he
rode to hounds and won golf tournaments
besides he had left last night with frieda
glenn but it was dear god in heaven
-it ivas duke

  nan whispered how did you get
here

  you thought id gone away with
frieda didnt you silly child oh nan
how could you do such a horrible thing
if youd died i would have been a mur-
derer

  are you going to marry frieda

  of course not im going to marry
nan sheridan if shell only get well
you will wont you darling

  yes i will if youll kiss me again

  dukes lips were gentle frightened

  sorry mr carlton youll have to
leave miss sheridan mustnt be tired
she needs her strength

  duke left obediently quickly as if his
life held only one purpose-nans re-
covery

  the morning papers carried the an-
nouncement that the wedding of miss
nan sheridan to mr rodman carlton
prominent socialite and sportsman better
known as duke had been postponed
indefinitely while the bride elect was in a
hospital recuperating from an emergency
appendictomy

  nan slept most of the day her brides
bouquet of orchids and lilies-of-the-valley
crushed in her arms and as she slept she
dreamed of duke whose love had reached

her in the valley of the shadow of death
and led her back to life again and she
waked to wonder how she could have
doubted him

  the following day she felt quite herself
aside from weakness and a dizzy head but
when she suggested that she was well
enough to leave the hospital duke pro-
tested with surprising violence

  no nan you mustnt and then
seeing the worried crease of her forehead
he hastened to add if youre worrying
about the expense forget it it was partly
my fault ill take care of everything
when that did not dissolve the stubborn
set of her cherry mouth his voice be-
came more pleading please darling if
youd had your appendix out you wouldnt
be back in circulation the second day we
dont want a messy scandal do we
reluctantly nan allowed herself be per-
suaded although she would have preferred
a little gossip to this new postponement of
their wedding but then she didnt have
dukes horror of a little talk probably
because her family were neither wealthy
nor prominent

  in the days which followed nans rest-
lessness gradually diminished it was fun
to live in a bower of flowers to receive
great sheafs of roses from duke each
morning little cards which she read and
reread a hundred times

  duke was not lying when he saidshe
had never been so beautiful for the first
time in months she was getting enough
sleep eating regular nourishing meals it
had taken a lot of doing without lunches
to be a glamor girl on a shoestring in-
come from part-time modeling jobs

  the last hectic months were fading in
her memory those months since frieda
glenns husband had been killed on
bataan and frieda had come back to
new york a romantic young widow it
was only natural that duke should be
nice to frieda they had been engaged
before frieda met her aviator husband
before duke and nan had sat together
that historic night  a fifth avenue bus

  the miracle of that chance meeting still
brought the pounding blood to nans
cheeks-the idea of duke carlton falling
for a strange penniless model was still
hard to believe none of the glamorous
new friends whom she had met through
a kiss to make you well



duke knew quite how penniless she was

  when duke suggested that she stay in
the hospital a third week nan didnt
argue secretly she was beginning to
dread seeing people again there might
be some skeptical raised eyebrows and
requests to see her scar

  dr powers the expensive specialist
whom duke had called in consented with
reservations nan must see more people
get out of her room

  and so they put her in a wheeled chair
and rolled her out onto the sun porch it
was as exciting as a trip to europe with
duke hovering over her and nurses with
blankets and pillows they almost ran
over a lanky redhead who stepped aside
to let the cavalcade pass he did it with
such exaggerated disrespectful courtesy
that nan turned and stared after him
their eyes met for a single second but
nans came away feeling bruised and
that night when she was being prepared
for bed she questioned her nurse whos
the tall red-haired doctor

  tall red-haired you must mean
jere willis when he finishes his intern-
ship hes going into the army medical
corps isnt he divine

  nans voice was coolly disinterested
i wouldnt know

unfortunately her heart didnt
follow its example the next morning
when he came into her room carrying a
sheaf of records she thought he looked
the way gary cooper would look if he
were ten years younger and had red hair

  sorry to trouble you he said pulling
up a straight chair but the hospital lacks
your vital statistics his long body hung
off the chair

  why dont you sit over there nan
pointed to an overstuffed chair

  i wouldnt dare i might go to sleep

  she noticed the dark hollows under his
eyes

  you should try getting some sleep at
night nan suggested

  thanks for the suggestion ill men-
tion it to the next person who calls for
the ambulance in the middle of the night
and then ignoring nans quick flush he
uncapped his pen and now to work
usually this data is compiled when a
patient is admitted but when a patient

has a ruptured appendix it isnt always
possible

  is it necessary to be so nasty

  am i nasty jeres eyes were not as
innocent as his words i only know what
i read in the papers cats may look at
queens but internes dont get that close
to glamor girls lets see he went on
age-nineteen

  how do you know

  glamor girls are all nineteen

  even his eyebrows are impudent nan
thought

  occupation-being glamorous

  i suppose youre partly right i am a
professional model nan said

  and i suppose you call that work
dont you know were at war

  his violence made her jump you
dont like me she challenged

  not particularly jeres voice was
changed the fury gone it had been better
the other way uncomplimentary but alive
why

  jere shrugged youre a waste of time
hospitals are meant for the sick

  and i wasnt sick

  was but arent listen i havent
time to argue with you lets get going
nan had never been so annoyed in her
life lets i know how valuable your
time must be to the hospital i weigh one
hundred seven pounds my eyes are blue
i come of native born parents is there
anything else you need to know

  nans special nurse was startled at her
sudden decision to leave the hospital but
mr carlton said 

  mr carlton is not a medical author-
ity nan snapped if i must have some-
ones permission please send for dr
powers

  dr powers came quickly and his agree-
able manner made nan ashamed of her ill
temper i do appreciate how much
youve done for me dr powers and i
want to thank you for saving my life
dont thank me my dear your life
had been saved before i even saw you
seeing her surprise he explained in more
detail im past the age for charity work
by the time they located carlton and sent
for me jere willis the interne on
emergency had pulled you through hes
a brilliant fellow if he comes out of the
war in one piece hell have quite a career


new love magazine

  nan was a full minute digesting that
distasteful statement she wouldnt owe
her life to that red-headed bigot she
wouldnt

  i suppose dr willis is clever but he
didnt save my life duke did that if he
hadnt made me want to live  she
stopped shyly i suppose you think im
silly

  dr powers polished his glasses
thoughtfully ive never known how
much weight to put on this will-to-live
business but granted it was dukes pres-
ence which saved you and not jeres skill
youre still in jeres debt if he hadnt
done some clever detective work duke
would not have been here

  nan was listening to dr powers but
she was hearing another voice too with
this underwear feather haircuts like this
dont come out of   jere willis of
course a painful dye stained her cheeks
as she remembered their recent interview
how ungrateful he must think her she
must see him again before she left the
hospital

but she didnt see him again until she
was dressed in a blue faille with a
crisp white blouse and had every one of
her brown hairs set in careless perfection
by then she had the interview carefully
planned

  dr powers has told me that im very
much in your debt she began glibly
enough but stalled annoyingly before
something in jeres tawny eyes i didnt
know when i talked to you last that it
was you or i shouldnt have-

  skip it jere said bruskly and for a
minute nan thought he was going to be
nice but he quickly dispelled that illusion
it was only routine i did nothing for
you that wasnt my duty

  if youd had a choice i suppose youd
have let me die she flared

  he could at least have denied it quick-
ly in place of stopping to ponder no
no i wouldnt have it was damned good
practice pulling you through i might not
get another chance at a poison case like
it

  nan had never known how overpower-
ing physical anger could be her heart
was outpounding the nazi guns at stalin-
grad her blood racing along at a rate

which would have left whirlaway at the
post she drew herself up haughtily id
be only too glad to pinch-hit as a guinea
pig for the sake of your great future
but unfortunately your medical ability had
nothing to do with saving my life it was
saved by a kiss

  that got under his skin his facial
muscles were under control in an instant
but the startled look remained in his eyes
relentlessly nan pressed in for the kill
dukes kiss she added

  it was her valedictory of venom jere
was supposed to wither before its fury
but instead he looked definitely relieved
in another minute he would be laughing
but nan didnt have to stay to listen as
she swept out of the room she paused
and for the sake of the records i didnt
take poison because i wasnt invited to the
right luncheon it wouldnt be the right
luncheon if i werent there

  the afternoon was endless a thousand
times nan wished she hadnt dashed out
of the hospital in such a hurry had at
least waited to eat her lunch her apart-
ment boasted a fashionable sultan place
address and a completely empty refriger-
ator its single room was oppressively
small try as she would to forget him
her interview with jere had left a ten-
acious cloying reaction which she couldnt
shake off she was still thinking about
him when evening came and she was
dressing for duke in the loveliest thing
she owned a green hostess gown which
made her look very much like a lime
sherbet dryad

  duke was late and he was annoyed with
nan because she had left the hospital so
suddenly

  the carlton factories were busy on war
orders and duke was actually working
hard for the first time in his life nan
knew he was tired he kissed her a gentle
kiss which left her irritated and unsatis-
fied once in dukes arms she had thought
all her problems would vanish she
hadnt expected the same feeling of re-
straint which she had experienced in the
hospital with its lack of privacy

  i suppose we might as well set a new-
wedding date she suggested

  duke answered why yes sometime
in the fall dont you think

  seeing her quick hurt he crossed the
a kiss to make you well



 eosy way to get even
 more shaves with
 every gillette blade

 for f
 for c 
forc i

get extra use from every blade-
use thin gillettes and look top-grade
they mow down stubble plenty fast-
give thrifty easy shaves that last

   wash face thoroafbly with
  hot water and soap to soften
  beard and eliminate accumulated
  i grit that dulls shaving edges

room lifted one of her hands and pressed
it against his cheek im eager as can
be darling but first i want you well and
strong i want you to go to our country
place for a month or so mother would
love to have you and id run out week-
ends and whenever i could think of the
fun wed have just the two of us to-
gether 

  his eager voice was painting a rosy
picture a tempting one but every time
he paused for breath nan heard a hateful
refrain occupation-being glamorous
   dont you know were at war-
occupation-being glamorous

  sounds all right doesnt it duke
waited expectantly

  it sounds marvelous but duke im
wondering if i shouldnt try to do some
kind of war work i havent done a thing
if i stayed here in new york  

  but you cant stay here dukes
vehemence was unfortunate for it hard-
ened nans uncertainty into stubborn
determination

  why cant i  are you trying to get
rid of me

  nan

  im sorry i shouldnt have said that
only- oh lets skip it kiss me duke-
no no not that way im tired of being
a china doll

  so you want cave man stuff okay
dukes arms were strong they crushed
the breath out of her his lips were hard
and purposeful but they were not deliver-
ing the kisses for which she had hungered
something was missing she felt small
and lost possibly duke had been right
possibly she wasnt up to standard phy-
sically in spite of the five pounds she had
gained his cheek against her hair was an
oppressive weight

  i think it would be nice to be married
next fall

tut nan stuck to her determination to
-- stay in new york and do some kind
of war work even in the face of dukes
violent opposition however she did let
him talk her out of a job in the defense
industries and into becoming a volunteer
nurses aide that would permit her to
go on with her modeling nan was too

produced by
the maker of
the famous
gillette blue
blade


new love magazine

proud to explain to duke that a defense
job might have paid her more money

  the nurses aide work had its compen-
sations though for the group were to be
trained at memorial hospital and jere
willis was at memorial watching him
eat a few words would be a refreshing
sight

  the course was divided into two parts
two weeks of lectures and instruction fol-
lowed by three weeks of actual hospital
work nan worked faithfully on the pre-
liminary training she simply had to be
good

  the day the class entered the hospital
was the hottest spring day she had ever
known the blue pinafore which had
looked so pretty in pictures felt like
ticking to her sensitive skin at the door
of memorial she sternly stifled an impulse
to turn and run with knees which felt
like undercooked taffy she slowly climbed
the steps to her first day of duty

  she was delighted to find that they
were assigning her to pediatrics a sick
baby wasnt as formidable as a sick adult
but nans delight was premature miss
hickey the supervisor was a dragon
she shoved a carton of gauze under nans
nose instructing her to make bsgs
and disappeared with a swish of starched
skirt

  helplessly nan stared at the gauze until
a student nurse came along and conde-
scendingly helped her out heavens
dont you even know about big square
gauzes  nan didnt but she learned
rapidly

  the morning dragged on at ten oclock
nan was folding gauzes and found her-
self doing the same thing when eleven
rolled around her back ached unmerci-
fully from standing so long in one spot
but she was afraid to stop even for a
drink it was almost twelve when miss
hickey rushed in to her

  bring a clean sheet into emergency
youll find one in the linen closet and
then disappeared

  nan sped away but there was no sheet
in the linen room a friendly nurse direct-
ed her to the laundry on another floor
when she came back five minutes later
flushed and triumphant the door to the
emergency room was closed nan knocked
timidly and was told to come in the

room was filled with nurses and doctors
one of them was a redhead

  i-i brought the sheet she began
uncertainly

  we couldnt wait all day miss hick-
ey snapped we used a clean bedspread
get an antiseptic basin and be quick about
it and shut the door

  nan had noticed an open bathroom
door and sped to it quickly but there was
no antiseptic basin there were any num-
ber of wash basins realizing that miss
hickey didnt like to be kept waiting nan
grabbed one of them

  but again she wras wrong miss hickey
was horrified dont you even know an
antiseptic basin  she sent a student
nurse on the errand and nan crept away
down the hall her cheeks burning her
eyes glazed with angry tears it was
twelve-thirty and she had been supposed
to leave at twelve

  as she washed her hands so conscien-
tiously stripped of nail polish and jewelry
she resolved that she would never never
set foot in the hospital again why hadnt
miss hickey told her where things were
kept was a brand new nurses aid sup-
posed to have been born knowing all about
memorials store-rooms

jere willis was at the door when
nan left the hospital waiting to gloat
she thought viciously although she was
walking quickly his long legs had no
difficulty keeping pace with her

  just wanted to say good-bye and its
been nice having you here today

  what do you mean good-bye nan
snapped

  you wont be back not after what hap-
pened its one thing to work but quite
another to be yelled at unjustly

  the uncanny accuracy of his analysis
took her breath it also stiffened her
backbone i havent the faintest notion
of quitting she answered loftily dont
let me take ysi from your important
work

  she hoped she was epitome of dignity
but she hadnt much faith in wilted blue
denim

  youre not taking me from my work
im on vacation for twenty-four long
glorious hours

  heavens are you leaving town
a kiss to make you well



  nope im treating myself to eight
hours of good old shuteye and then im
going dancing with a good looking gal
for the relief of the navy this is my
corner so long

  he moved away with lazy long-legged
grace

  nan used a whole bottle of bath salts to
soak the smell of the hospital out of her
as she lay in the tub relaxing she
thought how long it had been since she
had been dancing-weeks literally she
and duke had become very dull chil-
dren since the initiation of their all
work policy surely a little play
wouldnt be unpatriotic

  duke called her promptly at seven
youre all right darling

  there was a newly-acquired concern in
his voice

  horribly so nan answered sudden-
ly impatient with this solicitude about
her health so right that i feel like go-
ing places and doing things dont you
have some tickets for the navy relief
party tonight

  why yes of course but its going
to be mob scene

  i know the entire human race

  i dont think it would be the smart
thing for you lets drive up along the
hudson  know a quiet little place where
youve never been

  but i dont want a quiet little place i
feel like swing music and excitement oh
by the way do you know my age

  why youre nineteen

right i thought possibly youd got
mixed up and thought it was ninety-one
i was only thinking of you dukes
voice was stiff and hurt i didnt think
youd feel up to facing a crowd

  why not what do i have to hide
nan replaced the telephone slowly the
sparkle gone from her face she did have
something to hide a cowardly shameful
something-her suicide attempt how
could she have been such a quitter if
she hadnt been so physically exhausted
so desperate financially not daring to take
an ordinary job least everyone know her
true financial state but there were no
excuses which could explain away her
sinful act

  possibly she was sticking her neck out
insisting on this party tonight maybe

she should call duke and tell him shed
reconsidered for a second time her back-
bone stiffened because she had been a
coward in the past was no excuse for con-
tinuing to be one

  to bolster her courage she wore the
loveliest thing she owned it was a dress
she had earned modelling which she had
intended for her trousseau-a lovely blue
marquisette unexpectedly kindled with
an american beauty sash and a skirt
miles wide the mirror assured her that
she was a knockout in it but still she had
some misgivings defiantly she elevated
her chin she was going to that dance if
the whole world were there to shame her
with their whisperings

hphe whole world was dukes world
which had become nans possibly it
was only her guilty conscience that made
her feel she was being scrutinized as close-
ly as a saboteurs cache everyone was
terribly cordial how nice to see you
again nan heavens where have you
been keeping yourself and have you
recovered from your operation

  but what about the things they were
thinking appendicitis my eye do you
suppose shell be able to hang onto him
this time

  but this was crazy she was only im-
agining nan looked up at duke seeking
reassurance but his forehead was creased
in a black frown and he was glaring out
over nans brown head then it must be
true that people were gossipping un-
consciously nan followed the direction of
dukes glaring eyes

  she recognized frieda instantly frieda
would be wearing black in a crowd of
pastels looking cool and sophisticated
and then she recognized the man with
her even in a dinner jacket red hair
was still red hair

  duke was moving toward them cutting
through the dense crowd like a sabre
through a wedding cake nans heart
twisted so it wasnt over duke was still
interested in frieda

  they were very close now nan saw
jere say dont look but i think were
being shadowed saw the lazy raising of
friedas eyes her cool appraisal

  hi nan said someone had to say
something


new love magazine

  shall we exchange partners that
was duke

  and then nan was dancing with jere
at least jere was dancing-nan was more
like a sleep-walker

  thats not a very funny smile jere
said softly in her ear

  nan started oh    no i dont sup-
pose it is something was worrying me
and now it isnt but theres something
else

  i catch out of the frying pan into the
foxhole

  yes thats it nan was grateful for
his understanding how did you happen
to know frieda

  professionally she was in the hos-
pital once jere said studying nan

  frieda in the hospital what was she
doing there shes strong as a horse
i cant answer that one professional
ethics but it wasnt appendicitis

  normally nan would have skipped it
but tonight she was too raw too hurt
if you knew how ashamed i am youd
never say that word again

  okay i wont if youll wake up and
really dance its tough on my one night
off to get stuck with two girls with but
a single thought

  i dont know what you mean nan
said stiffly

  oh yes you do jere snapped his
fingers in front of her eyes come out
of the never-never land my darling
were at war eligible young men with
bank accounts and proper draft numbers
dont hang on every bush

  cold fingers of ice clutched nans heart
you think frieda wants to marry
duke

  think it my god i know it and
so do you but you wont admit it

  jeres blunt statement was a dash of
cold water and nan didnt like cold water
to be thrown in her face she preferred to
have it served in goblets disguised as wine
but possibly jere didnt know what he
was talking about after all she had no
reason to trust him that much since
youre so well informed whats dukes
reaction

  duke thats easy his bank ac-
count and torso are above average but
otherwise hes simply a normal human
being and being human hes attracted by

frieda now dont stiffen up ill prob-
ably cut him out with her but even if i
dont you can easily make him marry
you its silly to get all steamed up duke
cant help what he feels toward frieda
any more than i can help the fact that
being close to you changes the chemistry
of my bloodstream

  nans heart started to cut up capers
heel-kicking hat-throwing capers and in
spite of her anger there was nothing she
could do about it for the heart is an in-
voluntary muscle

  your modesty surprises me you dont
really doubt your ability to make frieda
forget duke do you nan said hoping
to hide her inner tumult with a veneer of
cool sarcasm

  oh that jere lowered his voice con-
fidentially frieda wants a husband-
you all do and i definitely am not in the
market for a wife its a tremendous
handicap but i dont mind otherwise it
would be too easy

  of all the colossally conceited asses
but at the instant nan was sure she had
made up her mind about jere she looked
up and found in the amber depths of his
eyes a wicked sparkle an upsetting con-
tagious sparkle her smile began staidly
in her eyes but by the time it had reached
her mouth it was a rascal of a smile

  jere gathered her into a rib-crushing
hug come on he begged lets leave
the sex angle to freud and have some
fun

  okay lets nan answered recklessly

  but she didnt expect it to be quite so
much fun jere went all out in his danc-
ing and his manhandling was a refreshing
change from dukes gentle clasp at the
end of the first dance her face was flushed
her hair a ball of topsy turvy brown
gold in the middle of the second dance
the navy discovered her it was fun
watching a blue uniform coming to cut in
it was more fun seeing jere work his way
through the crowd to reclaim her

tfytuch later nan and jere went out on
h- the balcony in search of cold beers a
glimpse of the moon and their breath nan
was happier than she had been since
friedas return to new york because
there were no vacant tables they wan-
dered off to a secluded corner to drink
a kiss to make you well



their beer leaning on the wide railing

  nan didnt know when she became con-
scious of the other couple in the shadows
i think were not alone she said soft-

ly-

  very observing my darling when
your eyes grow more accustomed to the
dimout youll recognize our fellow coun-
trymen jere lit a cigarette and handed
it to nan

  duke and frieda should i go over
and take her by the hair 

  good lord no were having fun
too jeres fingers caressed the place on
nans neck where the curls clustered
thickest it didnt make sense that she
should enjoy their touch so much but she
did besides youve nothing to worry
about youll get the guy

  it was the second time jere had made
that statement i dont know what makes
you so sure nan said sharply

  dont you a new ironic note in his
voice brought nans head up quickly
again she was on the defensive

  on second thought i guess i do if
duke didnt love me he couldnt have
made me want to live by kissing me was
that what you meant

  it was a long minute before jere spoke
and when he did his voice was harsh
not exactly but lets skip it gorgeous
moon isnt it

  but he was not looking at the moon
nan squirmed around in his arms until
she too could see the couple at the end
of the balcony they had come to their
feet and were merged in a long close
kiss as nan looked she felt twin stabs
of jealousy duke had no business kiss-
ing frieda that way and jere had no right
to be so angry about it

  because she was hurt and angry nan
acted impulsively i believe you fight
fire with fire with a defiant toss of her
head she raised her face to jeres for a
long poignant minute while his lips
hovered over hers she was swept with a
medley of emotions what was it going to
be like having jere kiss her

  she did not find the answer for jere
suddenly raised his head and i believe
prevention is the best cure he picked
her off the railing and set her on be-
wildered feet come on lets go in and
dance

  back in the ball room nan didnt know
whether to be furious or flattered why
had jere refused to kiss her

  the crowd had thinned and duke had
no trouble making his way toward them
although his wide shoulders took space
he was very close before they noticed
him

  remember youve got him roped and
tied if you dont spoil it jere had just
time enough to whisper a warning

  ive been looking all over for you
duke said

  where in friedas hair it was the
perfect reply but jeres eyes kept nan
from using it instead she went docilely
into dukes arms

  ive had such a wonderful evening
she said as she danced away with duke
jeres raised eyebrow was a salute and
the silly little gesture made nan happy
all the way to her toes

  when duke suggested that they drive
the long way to her apartment she laugh-
ingly refused and wear out tires be-
sides i have to be at the hospital at seven
tomorrow

  he lingered at the door uneasily 
tried to dance with you some more but
you were having such a rush i couldnt
get near

  think nothing of it darling nan
was surprised how easy it was to be mag-
nanimous it was sweet of you to rescue
frieda jere should have been spanked
for brushing her off so completely she
yawned sorry not to ask you up but
seven comes mighty fast 

  brushing his cheek with a light kiss
she slipped away from him although she
was not by nature a gloater nan hugged
herself all the way up to the sixth floor
and she wasnt at all surprised when her
telephone rang fifteen minutes later

  just wanted to tell you good night
again darling dukes voice came to her
in a caress

  so she had him worried the shoes
didnt feel so good on his own feet nan
giggled as she jumped into bed and pulled
off her table light jere willis certainly
knew his psychology and then her mood
became serious again she was indebted
to jere he had turned what could have
been-what had started out to be-a bad
evening into a lot of fun


new love magazine

  was he being facetious when he said
she upset the chemistry of his blood-
stream probably otherwise he would
have kissed her and yet on die other
hand her logic might be all wrong he
had said he didnt want a wife possibly
he had been afraid to kiss her it was a
nice thought

  dont be a fool nan admonished
herself angrily you love duke stop
thinking about jere stop it i say do
you hear me stop

it was a thick hot summer new
york at its worst people with one
job felt wilted and depressed but nan
struggled gamely along with her two
she had never dreamed one could walk
so many miles in a hospital corridor
never known how many supplies one
needed she folded millions of dressings
but each day brought more interesting
assignments as she was allowed more re-
sponsibility

  in the hospital people took on new
personalities a doctor became an ex-
alted personage even an interne had
to be treated with reverence it seemed
almost a dream that once she had danced
in jeres arms

  but there were days when she wished
she need never see a hospital again but
on the whole they were happy weeks
duke was out of town a lot but on the
nights they were together he was sweeter
than ever

  it was the last day of her training a
hot one early in june at noon she was
feeding an elderly man one of her favor-
ite patients he had a little trouble with
his soup and she noticed that his breath-
ing was jerky gasping while nan was
cutting his meat into small pieces he
closed his eyes and when she spoke to
him he did not respond she waited pa-
tiently hating to disturb him too much
beads of moisture stood on his forehead
and a white line circled his lips wor-
ried nan picked up his wrist but she
could find no pulse

  quickly she snapped on the light but
several minutes passed and no one came
suddenly nans worry became panic she
ran out of the room

  the head nurse came in a hurry took
one look and sent for a doctor jere and

one of the house doctors arrived at the
same time they tried artificial respira-
tion but it was useless

  well he certainly went in a hurry
one of the doctors remarked

  nan couldnt believe her ears the nice
old man wasnt dead not really it hadnt
been ten minutes since she had given him
his soup if shed only sent for help when
she noticed his breathing he might have
been saved what right did she have to
play nurse she must quit immediately
before she killed anyone else

  she was a block away from the hospital
and going fast when jere overtook her

  hey wait a minute where are you
going he took her arm

  home nan said where i belong-
where i cant do any harm her eyes
heavy with unshed tears begged him to
leave her alone

  youre stopping at my place first for a
drink he told her

  no jere    please

  but jere was adamant ill kick you
out in half an hour-dont worry im on
emergency tonight and i need sleep
when she still objected he said with a
grin dont be coy my etchings are put
away for the duration

  it seemed incredible to nan that she
had once thought him nice shed show
him how immune she was to his fatal
charm i could stand a drink

  jeres one room apartment was a nest of
pipes and books and unsorted laundry
there was lint on the floor and the day-
bed was unmade as nan waited for him
to appear with the drinks she moved
about automatically picking up and
straightening

  when he came in she said severely i
should think you might keep the place
clean

  jeres eyes were malicious as he handed
her the tall glass its a bad sign when a
gal starts looking after a man

  that was the straw too many for nans
strained emotions snatching a glass from
the tray she pitched its contents squarely
in his startled face

  the tears she had been hanging onto so
grimly slipped their leash her chin quiv-
ered and the sobs which followed must
have come from her toes to hurt so badly

  flicking the liquor out of his eyes jere
a kiss to make you well



placed his tray oil the table he picked
nan up and sat down with her on the
chair that was the least cluttered al-
though she could hear his voice it was sev-
eral minutes before the meaning of his
words came through to her

  i know how you feel the first time it
happened to me i went out and got glori-
ously plastered but its one of the things
youve got to learn to take

  he was so sweet and patient nan
sobbed if id called someone sooner he
might be alive the sobs rose again
choking her words

  jere waited until she had quieted non-
sense his voice was brusk he had a
heart condition which was bound to flick
him off nothing could stop it

  thats awfully nice of you but-
look at me jere pried her face out
of the shelter of his shoulder there are
a lot of things people might call me but by
god nice isnt one of them have i ever
bothered to lie to spare your feelings
why of course he hadnt and yet nan
didnt dare let herself be comforted

  have i jere repeated

  no-no you havent in the moist
blueness of nans eyes appeared a rainbow
of renewed hope and courage

  good girl jere patted her approving-
ly come out into the kitchen and wash
your face and ill fix a new drink

the kitchenette was as immaculate as
the other room was untidy it
wouldnt be sanitary to have it dirty jere
explained i cook here

  they had their drinks sitting on the
white enamel table its so much nicer out
here jere said

  it must have been good liquor for it
made nan feel warm and cozy and it made
jere sitting beside her explaining angina
cases seem the nicest kindest person she
had ever known nan was horrified when
she looked at her watch to see how long
she had overstayed her time limit guiltily
she slid off the table

  true to form jere did not urge her to
stay but he did follow her to the door
when she tried to put her appreciation in-
to words he interrupted impatiently skip
it if you feel so heavily in my debt you
might come back tomorrow night and ill
broil lobsters

  nans heart gave a lurch wholly out of
proportion to her fondness for broiled lob-
sters a lurch which put her  her guard
thatll be grand duke and i are both
crazy about lobster you dont mind if i
bring him

  no of course not do bring duke
jere answered there was a gleam in his
eyes nan couldnt interpret she wasnt at
all sure she liked it but she was sure of
one thing-jere was going to kiss her and
if she had any sense at all she would stop
him but she wasnt going to stop him
after all why be prudish about a silly little
kiss

  and then nan knew too late as jeres
lips pinned down her fluttering nervous
ones that this was to be  casual kiss no
surface nice-to-have-met-you affair it was
genuine as rain and sun and fundamental
as life his lips were cruel in their in-
tensity cruel and-wonderful

  nan had reached the end of a long quest
these were the kisses for which she had
been waiting they were the kisses which
had led her back to life the kisses for

for energy


new love magazine

which she had been asking so fervently

  with an almost superhuman effort she
broke away from jeres arms white and
startled she stared up at him jere recov-
ered first that was a mistake i apolo-
gize

  there was nans answer she turned
and fled as she walked rapidly along the
street she was unaware of the hot sun
streaming on her uncovered head inside
her mind was reeling her heart stagger-
ing so it had been jere-not duke-who
had kissed her in the hospital that night
how jere must have laughed when he
found the significance she had attached to
those kisses she blushed remembering
how she had thrown up to him that it was
duke who had saved her life

  fool she had been now she under-
stood why he had refused to kiss her at the
dance afraid lest she discover the identity
of the man who had touched her heart
afraid lest she offer him an unwanted love

  nan didnt know how far she had
walked she only knew that she was sud-
denly very tired as a person awaking
from a heavy sleep she looked about and
found she was in central park she sat
down gratefully on an empty bench

  as her head cleared she tried to think
there was no undoing what had happened
she would have to face jere with the
knowledge that he knew she was in love
with him she hadnt fallen in love with
him she had slipped into it without know-
ing it

  but what about duke  two months ago
she couldnt face life without him nan
rubbed her eyes with the back of her hand
because the blur had returned duke had
dazzled her swept her off her feet and she
had thought it was love what should she
do about him now would she have to
hurt him as jere had hurt her in her new
awareness of pain nans heart shied away
from inflicting so much pain on another
duke loved her surely-even though he
had not kissed her back to life he had
demonstrated it in a thousand ways this
past summer could she squeeze jere out
of her heart and dedicate her life to duke 
she must

  nan dragged herself up from the bench
it was late and a long hot walk to her
apartment when she reached it she was
tempted to crawl into bed and refuse to

even answer the telephone but slje
wouldnt let herself be that weak grimly
she bathed and dressed in a gown of
dukes favorite blue as she tied the damp
ringlets away from her face with a match-
ing ribbon she was surprised to find that
aside from violet smudges under her eyes
she looked no different than usual

  a broken heart becomes you my girl
a sob caught at her throat but dont
you dare start crying

tvhen duke hadnt called by seven-
 thirty nan dialed his number and was
greeted by the busy signal he was in
town probably he would call her in a few
minutes when a half hour had passed and
no call came she tried again the wire
was still busy she decided he must be tied
up with long distance calls as he fre-
quently was

  because she could no longer stand her
own company nan decided to walk the few
blocks to his apartment and surprise him
lights glowed from his living room win-
dows which proved he was in because no
one left lights on in these nights of unex-
pected blackouts the friendly doorman
let her in without bothering to buzz
duke nan took the elevator to his floor

  for a few seconds she stood outside his
apartment composing herself listening to
the vague indistinct sounds which speak of
human presence the she knocked her
usual brisk tattoo and waited for dukes
familiar footsteps

  when he didnt come she rapped a sec-
ond time louder and more briskly there
was a sudden hush behind the locked door
it was the hush which comes over the for-
est when the hunter approaches with his
gun nan gave herself a mental shake she
must stop imagining such foolishness she
was no hunter and duke wouldnt hide
from her

  she would pound louder make him hear
her but in the act of doing so she stopped
motionless and stood with her arm raised
frozen duke wasnt in there alone there
was someone with him whom he didnt
want her to see it could be but one per-
son-frieda

  half way to the elevator nan was sur-
prised to find she was tiptoing as she
walked slowly home she wondered why
this new blow didnt hurt was she
a kiss to make you well



numbed to suffering she was sure it was
only temporarily that the pain would come
and it would be overwhelming but she
would face it this time take it standing on
her feet because she dared not risk the
long sleepless hours of the night with their
undermining loneliness nan called me-
morial and asked if they could use an ex-
tra nurses aide she buttoned herself
hastily into a fresh uniform and called a
taxi

  i am certainly glad to see you the
head nurses greeting was cordial if
youll answer lights youll do a lot toward
preserving my sanity

  the corridor looked like broadway be-
fore the blackout it was hot and the pa-
tients couldnt sleep they wanted fresh
water or their pillows smoothed and nan
went from one to another

  in the hallway of open doors there was
one that was dosed it belonged to mr
williams who had hallucinations of people
trying to harm him thinking how hot his
room must be nan opened the door and
stood quietly listening satisfying herself
that he must be sleeping she moved away
leaving the door ajar

  when she came by it again a few min-
utes later it was tightly shut so he wasnt
asleep nan went in to see if she couldnt
do something to help him get some rest
in the dim light she could see that his bed
was empty and even as she noted it the
door crept shut behind her

  so youre the one

  i thought youd be more comfortable
with the door open nan said in the
calmest voice she could muster as she
spoke she backed toward the head of the
bed hoping to be able to find his light cord

  her fingers were on the cord groping
toward the switch when the hands came
out of the darkness and a viselike grip
caught her right arm there was a sicken-
ing snap a wave of pain and nan learned
how easily an arm could be broken

  the hands reached her throat jere
   jer     the scream died off into a
gurgle the fingers banding her throat
were wires barbed wires digging cutting
pressing her breath was going with
her last strength nan kicked the bedside
table

  the door must have been opened be-

cause it was lighter there was a smack
it was a fist hitting a chin but nan didnt
know about that until later-much later

the smell of sipirts of ammonia was
strong and the light blinding when
nan came back to consciousness she
wondered who the people were and why
they kept hurting her arm

  gradually as things stopped whirling
she recognized one of the house doctors
and two of the nurses but there should
be someone else her eyes groped on until
they found jere jere with a very black eye
and a scratched cheek

  you seem to make a habit of saving
my life nan said ignoring the others

  his cocky grin was unsteady i cant
take the bows this time they go to duke
for being psychic

  so he wanted none of her not even her
gratitude

  were going to set your arm ill be as
gentle as possible but it may hurt quite a
bit the doctor told her

  it did hurt excruciatingly but nan set
her teeth against the pain and clung to the
hand of one of the nurses once jere came
to her and stuck a hypodermic needle into
her arm because his hand trembled slight-
ly because there were huge drops of mois-
ture on his forehead nan managed a re-
assuring smile for him

  at last it was over and her arm a neat
white bundle and they wheeled her off into
a bed wrapping her up in spite of the
heat

  she fell into a half sleep and was con-
scious of someone calling nan nan
darling she was fighting against the
sound of that voice

  for a second she opened her eyes but
closed them quickly it was only duke as
she should have known it would be for
jere didnt call her darling he called
her my darling

  you thought frieda and i were-oh
you silly child

  why should she bother to stay awake
to hear something she had heard before
duke leaning over her bed assuring her
of his love was a movie shed seen before
and not a very good movie

  but his voice was persistent for being
in a dream i can explain everything


new love magazine

frieda came to see me about some insur-
ance shes having trouble collecting i
didnt know it was you at the door

  suddenly nan was fully awake she
wasnt reliving a scene from the past
this was the present and again duke
had come running to her declaring his
love only this time she wasnt the gul-
lible trusting girl shed been before

  with an effort she said how did you
happen to find me herq

  after you were gone i was worried
i was so afraid youd- his voice broke

  nans mind supplied the end of the sen-
tence hed thought shed try again to
take her life and shed thought jere a
conceited ass

  and then what did you do

  i called your apartment but you didnt
answer and then i started calling hospitals
frieda said id never find you and so she
called willis and told him i was worried
about you that youd seemed depressed
his voice trailed off he slid to his knees
beside the bed oh nan darling well
be married tomorrow 

  and so duke didnt love her either-
he was only afraid to tell her so lest she
commit suicide nan closed her eyes

  get up and go back to frieda her
voice was low but steady we wont be
married tomorrow-or any other day we
dont love each other she managed a
twisted smile tell frieda therell be no
hard feelings im really grateful to her
for coming back

  dukes expression changed slowly from
disbelief to a mixture of relief and hurt
ego which made nan uncertain whether
she wanted to laugh or cry he said
youre absolutely sure

  positive i thought my heart was hurt
that other time but now i know it was
only my pride i guess ive grown up at
last duke learned to take things there
was a trace of bitterness in her voice be-
cause she was thinking-i can even take
knowing i love a man who doesnt love
me

  the door swung open admitting a red-
haired tornado your times up

  it is hard to make a dignified exit when
another man finds you on your knees be-
side a girls bed but duke managed

  is that any way to speak to a visitor
nan asked when she and jere were alone
afraid to let a silence grow between them

  no its not but its the way to speak
to a two-timing stuffed shirt

  arent you forgetting that hes my
fiance

  he is not oh i know its not nice to
eavesdrop but i gave the guy five minutes
before i started listening

  jere was across the room and down be-
side the bed where duke had been only a
minute ago only this time it didnt seem
silly-it seemed wonderful too good to be
true

  nan dearest if you hadnt got hep to
him id have broken your neck

  but jere whats it to you you
dont-

  love me you dont want a wife
jere finished the sentence for her youre
mixed in your tenses darling i didnt
want to love you and i didnt want a
wife- he stopped his voice becoming
sober did you ever want to murder
nan

  she shook her head

  well i have twice tonight first
when i found williams choking you and
again when duke came running back-
we wont go into that but at least it
knocked all the silly notions out of my
head nan dearest will you forget how-
nan had only one arm but she used it to
advantage as she pulled the rumpled red-
head close against her breast she knew it
was the thing she had been wanting to do
since the first day she saw him

  jere she said much later why did
you kiss me that night

  because you made me so damned mad
id done everything and you wouldnt re-
act so i thought to hell with her shes
nothing but a sleeping beauty and then
i remembered how the prince wakened the
sleeping beauty-

  and so you kissed me and it saved my
life nans voice was dreamy

  the hell it did jere contradicted
the stomach pump did that

  ill never believe that you made me
well by kissing me nan snuggled more
deeply into his arms you know jere
i think im going to be sick a lot

the end

lawrence

that was all sally knew about
nick and yet she offered her
heart before he asked for her
hand

sally poured hot coffee from the
thermos and gave nick a corned
beef sandwich it was as if he
was someone she had always
known

the new welder had his back to
sally he was already at work
when she arrived that morning at
her bench in the munitions factory he
wore a blue coverall and his head was
completely covered by the enormous weld-

ers helmet she saw that he was tall
and lean and was apparently having a
wonderful time

  take that hitler he cried trium-
phantly as he placed his welding torch
against the glowing metal and made the




new love magazine

sparks fly thatll burn off your mus-
tache you so and so

  sally also wore a blue coverall and her
face and head were covered with a big
welders helmet she took up her torch
and went to work but the whir and noise
of the torches didnt drown out the new
mans enthusiasm

  take that tokio he cried blazing
away with his torch thatll put a spot
on your rising sun take that and
that

  this went on for more than an hour
while everyone in the big welding room
worked away furiously only sally just
back of the new man could hear his de-
lighted war cries as he worked

  then there was a pause and he turned
and said its great to be winning the
war isnt it shorty he slapped sally
a resounding bang on her shoulders

  she recovered her balance and turned
on him take your hands off me you
big stiff she said

  the two helmets glared at each other
although neither of them could see the
others face

  great guns youre a girl the new
man cried

  sallys voice was heavy with sarcasm
could be she said grimly

  but i didnt take a good look at you
and i just thought you were a short little
guy behind me im sorry if i nearly
knocked you down now that i take a
look at you i can see that-

  he was looking at the swell and curve
of her breasts size thirty-four bust curv-
ing down to a size twenty-four waist made
something to look at

  he looked thoughtfully i can see
that-that-

  i see that you can see sally said
and she gave him a sharp kick in the shin

  oh hey now he cried i didnt
mean anything isnt there enough going
on in the world without us starting a pri-
vate war

  for answer sally simply turned her
back and picked up her blow torch and
went back to work sending sparks flying
in all directions another hour went by
while the new man worked away letting
out an occasional burst of triumphant
hate against the enemy then another
pause   

  he turned and asked say what do
you look like under that helmet i mean
do you have a face to match that-that-

  he was looking at the curves again and
sally stiffened

  never mind he said hastily dont
kick again i just wondered if your face
matched or if you were a ghoul

  im a ghoul sally said i have
green eyes an eagle beak then she
turned furiously back to her work

  a half hour later he said well i
could always take you out with the helmet
on and introduce you as my woman from
mars

  sally didnt answer but after a time
the noon whistle blew and then sh
jerked off her helmet and there she was
red-gold hair spilling suddenly from het
loosened snood and falling about hex
shoulders in soft loose waves her face
was young and waxy-fresh without make-
up and she had great brown eyes and a
few little freckles on her button nose her
lips were wide and bright pink and she
had a stubborn chin

  she blinked at the new mans helmeted
face and he stared

  great day in the morning he said
simply then he took his helmet off and
it was her turn to stare

he had crisp brown curls and deep-set
gray eyes and a hard-as-rock brown
face he was rather frighteningly hand-
some tall and dark and lean and there
was a long cleft in his big chin sally
smiled

  hello she said and her voice was
suddenly very sweet and very very fem-
inine after all with men getting scarcer
and scarcer a girl didnt see anything like
this every day in the week

  hello he said and he grinned show-
ing glinting white teeth it crinkled his
brown face and made his gray eyes dance
im nick thomas

  im sally blaine she said and then
they shook hands solemnly

  you are a darn gorgeous ghoul he
said

  im sorry i kicked you she said

  and then they just looked at each other
some more

  its great to have a job he said then
ive been without work for three months
tall dark and -f



nearly i tried my darndest to enlist
even tried the merchant marine but no
o im stuck in -f and thats that i
usted my knee cap once in a sort of ship-
wreck and ive got a silver plate in my
knee so they wont take me my knees
as good as anything though i can hike
ten miles and everything but try to con-
vince them no they say im -f and
so im -f so finally i gave up and got
this job and its swell after all say i bet
i killed about a thousand japs this morn-
ing after all theyve got to have muni-
tions huh

  sure sally said this is winning
the war too you know im sorry
though about your knee were you a
sailor when you were hurt

  not exactly i had a job on a private
boat sort of say im hungry enough to
eat a horse wheres the cafeteria around
here anyhow

  a cafeteria in a grant factory sally
scoffed dont make me laugh we
bring along a lunch pail here

she picked up her red lunch box and
thermos from under her bench and waved
them at him he looked dismayed
then i havent any lunch lie cried
mom always puts in more than i can
eat sally said come on

  no kidding youve got enough
sure sally said leading the way into
a stock room

  they found a packing case near a large
window and sally spread her lunch out
outside of that window was the little
town of grantville vermont where she
had always lived it was a grubby little
factory town built around the ancient red
brick grant sewing machine factory
only recently the factory had been turned
into a munitions plant and the town was
full of new workers

  sally poured hot coffee from the ther-
mos and gave nick a corned beef sand-
wich it was as if he was someone she
had always known

  what do you mean no cafeteria
he cried there ought to be a cafeteria
for this crowd working here

  sally laughed maybe you ought to
just dash into new york and tell the
grant factory board of directors about
it she said listen the grant sewing
machine factory was founded a hundred

years ago by old n t grant and they
havent changed a thing about it since
then the factory has just gone on work-
ing people in the same old red brick sweat-
shop making money for the grant fam-
ily  the grant family moved away from
grantville years ao they are rich new
york society people today so what so
when they had to start making munitions
they only made just such changes as they
absolutely had to thcv dont care if we
eat out of a lunch pail

  say nick cried thats too darn
bad why dont the workers complain
why dont they protest or something
sally shrugged oh they do she
said they asked to have that south
brick wall torn out and glass brick put in
for light and they asked for a cafeteria
and the girls asked for a decent powder
room and even the town people have been
after them to put in a decent first aid
room but so what so the grants keep
going to cocktatil parties and the board
of directors keeps postponing things and
we keep bringing lunch pails here
have another sandwich

  nick took the other sandwich i
didnt know much about things here he
said i just got in yesterday and the
towns so crowded that i couldnt even
find a room im staying in the cooks
room at the local hotel you dont know
where i could get a room do you

  sally knew that he couldnt get a room
the town was that crowded but she had
an idea if she moved in with her sister
and her two kid brothers took her room
it would leave the attic room vacant the
attic room was private and had its own
washroom and a separate entrance from
the back stairs he would like that

  we might have a room at my house
she said you can come home with me
for dinner and talk to mom weve nev-
er had a boarder but everyone in town
has to help out now

  that would be swell he said they
stood up then and grinned at each other
thanks for the lunch ghoul he said

  sally smiled at him her heart pound-
ing even though a lot of new workers
had come to grantville there were still
very few handsome young men in town
very very few and here was nick
thomas-tall dark and -f and he


new love magazine

had dropped right out of the skies into her
very lap

  it must be fate sally went back to
her welding with her eyes shining life
was about to arrive in grantville she de-
cided after eighteen years of nothing
happening nick thomas had arrived

  he stopped his welding in the middle
of the afternoon to ask got a boy
friend

  well-not really sally said and went
red under her helmet

  she knew that eddie phillips the fore-
mans son considered her his girl he
was slight sandy headed and drank too
much he was -f too from an alco-
holic heart but he was one of the few
boys left in town now so sally had been
going places with him she knew that
eddie really meant to marry her his
father john phillips the foreman of the
factory even called sally daughter in a
joking way

  in fact everyone in the little town prob-
ably thought there was a sort of under-
standing between eddie and sally but
there wasnt really sally didnt even
like eddie she was convinced of that
now

  i dont have a real boy friend she
said firmly because already she knew
that nick was going to be her new boy
friend

  good  nick said then youll show
me the town tonight

  sally laughed theres one picture
show and two drug stores there is quite
a hot competition between the two drug
stores one of them puts both whipped
cream and a cherry on ice cream sodas
and the other retaliates by giving the cus-
tomers two olives with each sandwich
its a very wild town even a juke box
in the drug store on the corner you can
dance if it isnt too crowded

  well paint the town red nick prom-
ised well take in both soda fountains
and play all the records in the juke box

  it was wonderful really because
when she took nick home for dinner all
the family liked him her mother made
him at home in the attic room and he was
all moved in before dark

  in fact the late winter dusk was hanging
like a pale lavendar wrap about the shoul-
ders of the little town when sally and

nick started out to paint things red a
bit of silver moon hung above the hills
and the stars were out like jewels

  sally had put on her beige coat with the
fur collar and nick was more handsome
than she could have believed in his gray
tweeds they walked down the two
blocks of main street and sally knew that
everyone in town would know about her
new man in an hour

  at the end of the main street they halt-
ed for the sidewalk ended sally pointed
up the hillside to the pointed turrets of a
dark old mansion at the top of the hill

  thats our local castle she said the
old grant mansion its been boarded up
for ten years now ever since the old
mans death none of the younger grants
have even been back for a visit since the
funeral once in a while a servant comes
up to check things or something but
otherwise its vacant an awful waste
isnt it it would make a swell com-
munity center with dances in the big old
ballroom

  nick stuffed his hands in his pockets
and looked up at the dark mansion
youre darned right he said

a nd so then they went to the picture
show and first to one drug store and
then to the other at the second drug
store they played the juke box and danced
in a vacant room in back other couples
were there and sally introduced nick to
everyone presently eddie phillips came
in

  he was flushed and angry looking and
sally knew that he had been drinking
sally was dancing close in nicks arms
when eddie came over and tapped nicks
shoulder

  break he said

  youve been drinking too much ed-
die sally said quietly

  come on and dance with me youre
my girl you know eddie said loudly

  she doesnt want to dance with you
nick said so thats that go drink
some black coffee

  eddie glared at nick ive heard all
about you he said news travels fast
in this town you know youre a new
fellow at the factory but it sure looks
funny to me that you have moved right
into sallys house
tall dark and -f



  do you mean anything by that nick
asked coldly

  i mean just what you think i mean
he said and sallys going to get her-
self talked about

  id hate to hit a drunk man nick
said

  oh would you well you arent
drunk so i guess itll be all right if i hit
you eddie hit nick a hard unexpect-
ed blow on his chin that sent him against
a door that opened  a porch

  nick caught his balance and rushed at
eddie he pushed him outside and
yanked him down the steps to an old rain
barrel full of last nights rain water he
ducked eddies head in the cold water
and everyone laughed but sally went
white for she knew how much influence
eddies father had at the factory she
knew this would make eddie and his
whole family furious

  they would be furious with sally as
well as nick for allowing a strange boy
to humiliate their son the whole town
would probably feel that sail had gone
too far eddie drank but he was a home
town boy

  sally was silent as they walked home
but nick laughed about it

  if you had liked him i wouldnt have
done it he said he was just jealous
but i could tell you didnt like him

  no i didnt like him sally said
but small towns are funny nick they
dont like outsiders to come in and take
their girls and stick their heads down rain
barrels

  you arent his girl nick cried

  not any more you may be sure of
that sally said and laughed now and
then she looked at nick and knew that no
matter if people talked about her he was
worth it

during the next few weeks sallys
life became just so much a part of
nicks that it was hard to look back to a
time when-she didnt know him they
ate their lunch together every da and
sometimes talked until they forgot to eat
in the evenings after they had finished
work they went to the show or sat around
talking to other factory workers nick had
met and liked jerry and lane two men
at the factory who were intensely in favor

of improvements at the factory often
came to talk to nick because he was so
sympathetic and interested

  it was as if all her life had been wait-
ing for him

  then one night she awoke from a sound
sleep and saw the moonlight flooding her
bedroom a soft whistling sound came
from the orchard and she rushed to the
window nicks tall striding form was
coming up the lane apparently he had
gone out for a moonlight walk how won-
derful  sally had always wanted to go
out into the moonlight in the dead of the
night and had never had the courage

  somehow now she just had to go out
and meet nick

  she slipped quickly into slacks and a
polo coat and ran softly down the back
stairs the moonlight poured down
white hot and magic glistening on the
dew sally had no idea of the time she
only knew that this was a wonderful night
and she had to be out in it with nick

  hey she whispered night owl
i saw you and came down it must be
after midnight

  he laughed softly and put his arm
through hers it is nearly five oclock
in the morning he said ive been out
looking at-at the country side youd
better get back to bed

  and leave this beautiful moon im
wideawake and youll have to take me
walking in the moonlight now sally
said laughing

  nick laughed in new york five in
the morning is quite a conventional hour
to be coming home but im afraid that
here-well do you dare

  i do dare sally laughed come
and ill show you the top of the hill where
i used to go when i was a little girl

  and so they climbed a hill back of the
house and watched the sleeping town be-
low them wrapped in a veil of moon-
light

  she shivered and he put his arm about
her it was then he kissed her for the
first time he just held her to him and
put his lips on hers very tenderly very
sweetly and sally knew that the fire he
set then would never go out

  he let her go and said huskily sally
that-that wasnt the way i meant to do
it i meant to say a lot of things but-


new love magazine

lets go back now he took her arm

  and so they went back in silence and
sally clung to his arm

  the dawn was silver pink and gleaming
as they fan a little guiltily back along
the path an automobile passed them
in the misty road and sally gave a little
cry

  what will happen to my reputation
nick thomas she laughed you are
giving me big city ways coming in at
dawn

  but there was nothing to feel guilty
about really she told herself when she
was back in her room a moonlight stroll
and a kiss that was all yet she felt as
if she had done something wrong and
all day the feeling haunted her it was
at five oclock when john phillips the big
red-faced foreman sent for her to come to
his office

  he didnt ask her to sit down and he
spoke bluntly

  sally im disappointed in you i
thought you were the sort of girl who
could work along side of men without
losing your head and turning theirs but
i think youll have to leave the factory
i dont like to fire you but after all the
town is getting full of more mature and
more experienced workers and- maybe
we can use you in the office later

  she was fired like that

  but what in the world brought this
about she cried of course eddie is
angry with me but you arent so little
that-

  he looked her in the eyes i passed
you in a car at dawn this morning sally
you were walking along the road with
that new fellow at dawn in this town
we dont want a girl who will do that sort
of thing working in this factory i guess
thats about all sally

  she turned wordlessly and left she
didnt know whether to laugh or cry she
wondered if john phillips would tell his
wife and she knew he would his wife
would spread it and enlarge it it would
scandalize the town

  she had lost her job because she had
gone out into the moonlight with nick and
had come in at dawn but she kept a
stiff upper lip about it and passed it off
casually enough at home

  too many experienced men are com-

ing to town for welding jobs she ex-
plained at supper they are transfer-
ring me to the office but for a while ill
be doing nothing

  she told it so lightly that the family
took it casually her mother was glad to
have her back home to help especially
since nick made extra cooking and sal-
ly found that she loved being home know-
ing that she was cooking for nick having
him come home from work and find her
fresh and lovely having him praise her
cooking

  she was quite aware that the town was
gossiping but she didnt care when she
and nick were married all that talk would
stop soon enough  anyhow nothing mat-
tered now only nick

and so the day came when nick said
say tomorrow is my birthday are
you going to make me a birthday cake
sally

  and immediately sally began to plan a
little dinner for him a cake with candles
she would ask some of the friends he had
made at the plant and they would have a
special little dinner

  it was an unusually warm day in march
when they sat on the front veranda plan-
ning the birthday sally was holding
nicks hand and laughing up at him when
a car stopped in front of the house

  both sally and nick stood up as a
group of lovely girls and two men stepped
out of the expensive car

  who on earth    sally cried

  nick had gone scarlet and he jammed
his fists into his pockets

  friends of mine from new york he
said sally i-

  but he had no time to say more the
three girls and two men had reached the
veranda and were screaming at him as he
went out to greet them

  nickey grant one of the girls yelled
in a shrill voice you old meanie weve
come to take you back to town for your
birthday weve planned the most mar-
velous party at my penthouse caviar and
everything and everyone will be there
and ive got the best orchestra on broad-
way to play for you you can certainly
get away from the old factory for a few
days after all its your factory

  sally stood in the doorway hearing
tall dark and -f



what was said and her heart just leaped
to her throat grant nickey grant

  he turned and caught her arm and in-
troduced her to the group there was a
lean mustached youth named bill and a
short middle-aged man called fredie
there was a girl called candy who had
blonde hair and another girl with even
blonder hair called alice and there was
the tall very dark olive-skinned girl with
green eyes named diane who had put her
arms about nick and kissed him possess-
ively

  sally nick said im sorry for you
to find out who i am this way you see
the directors made me promise not to tell
my name here they didnt object to me
getting a job at the factory but they
thought it would sound like phony pub-
licity if it made the papers anyhow i
didnt want any favors i just wanted to
work here and find out wliat it was all
about for myself 

  then your name is-

  my name is nicholas thomas grant

iii he said simply my uncles and
the directors have charge of the factory
now but some dav it will belong to me

  i see  sally said

  well diane said uncle certainly
hasnt liked the reports you wrote him
he read about these people here who
want all sorts of improvements made he
said they were radicals and that he was
coming down to fire the ringleaders hes
planning to come back with you i
think-

  nick sally cried her face was pa-
per white you didnt write and tell
them what jerry and lane said did you
that was in confidence and now theyll
be fired nick how could you-

  she clung to his arm looking up into
his face

  well diane said fancy she
seems rather emotional over you maybe
you also forgot to tell her that we are en-
gaged

  engaged  sally whispered

  nick was crimson but he looked into
sallys eyes and said thats right my
engagement to diane was announced last
summer she didnt want me to come up
and work in the factory but- but we
didnt break our engagement did we
diane

  we certainly did not diane said
and i can see that it was about time
for me to come and get you you wrote
that you had found a cozy place to stay
but i had no idea how very cozy

  but sally was still staring into nicks
face a grant   

  and i told you all about the grant
family and showed you the house she
said you must have been laughing at
me

  sally i wasnt laughing nick cried
i wanted like the devil to tell you but
girls will talk and id promised the direc-
tors but i meant to go down to new
york in a few more weeks and get back
that promise and-sally there was so
much i wanted to tell you that i got
my knee hurt on my own yacht and that
the night i came in at five oclock i had
spent the night roving over the old grant
mansion with my flashlight

  nickey diane said sharply are
you going to get your things and come
with us or not dont tell me that the
charms of this place have got you down
he hesitated still looking at sally
but sally had grown suddenly cold and
hard with rising anger

  yes lies going she said bluntly
he wouldnt want to stay here now i
dont think he would find it very pleasant
here now

then she turned and ran to her room
and wept he went all right for
she heard him calling good-bye heard the
car driving away

  in the two weeks that followed sail
w-as tense and white and silent he wrote
her letters from new york but she sent
them back unopened his was another
life and another girl and sally didnt in-
tend to try to eat any crumbs he might
throw her the townspeople were saying
that he had jilted sally and she let them
talk nothing mattered nothing would
ever matter again   

  and then one day she was on main
street at the market across from the fac-
tory when molly jones who worked in
the factory saw sally

  look sally molly said theyre
putting in all the improvements in the fac-
tory the glass wall and the powder room
and the cafeteria

  sally looked and saw the workmen
yes they are she cried

  they have fifty workmen here so it
can all be done in a couple of days and
wont interfere with the factory produc-
tion molly cried and young nick
grant is taking the money right out of
his own pocket because he couldnt get
any action out of the board of directors
isnt it wonderful

  sally only stood there looking at the
bricks being torn down from the south
wall of the factory so nick was back in
town for a moment that was all she
could think of all she could feel then
she heard his voice at her elbow

  sure its wonderful he said

  then sally turned about and faced him
his gray eyes were laughing just as if he
hadnt ruined her life and left her picking
up the bits she looked at him and an
unreasoning fury rose in her breast

  oh i dont know she said tensely
we wanted all these improvements at
the factory all right but we wanted them
because we deserved them and not be-
cause-not because a playboy took pity
on the poor underpriviledged workers
we dont like charity nick grant

  then she felt the tears stinging her
eyes and she turned and rushed away
but he followed her up main street and
right in front of the corner drug store he
caught up with her he caught both her
arms and turned her to him so that he
could look down into her flushed face

  listen to me-

  let me go nick grant she cried
havent you done enough to me you
made me lose my job and my-my boy
friend and my reputation you made me
get-fired and my whole family is scan-
dalized ill never live down what you
did to me now dont start pawing at me
on main street go away and leave me
alone go away and leave grantville
alone weve got along without any
grants for a long time and we can do
without you  go on back to diane before
-before your caviar gets cold

she would have broken away from him
but he caught her closer and suddenly
he held her to him and kissed her he

kissed her right there on the main street
in broad daylight he kissed her hard
and long and long and then he held her
sobbing angry body to his

  thatll give the old town something to
talk about for awhile honey he said
and you are going to listen to me i
came back here to live im going to keep
on working in the factory and im going
to open the old mansion and live there
and turn the downstairs over for recrea-
tion rooms the factory is going to be
enlarged and a lot more workers will be
in town im going to do a lot of things
and ill need you sally i came back to
stay and to ask you to marry me

 marry you she gasped but
diane-

  oh we broke it off diane had her
own ideas of what she wanted me to do
she had a nice desk job lined up and she
thought id take it when i got over my
craze for working in the factory when
she found that i wasnt going to get over
that craze she was through plenty quick
and it was all right with me wed never
really hit it off it was all sort of an ar-
rangement that our families had brought
about i knew before she came here that
i had to break it off with her because id
fallen for you i didnt know what it was
like loving someone until i knew you
sally

  sally held her breath for a moment
trying to realize what was happening to
her she was going to be mrs nicholas
thomas grant iii and she was going to
live in the grant mansion how the
town would talk and how proud she
would be for them to talk about that

  nick still had her in his arms and she
looked over his shoulder and saw that
people were staring at them from every
store window and every street corner and
from every passing car she began to
laugh shakily

  youll have to marry me now nick
she said because i think youve just
shattered the last shred of my reputa-
tion 

  in that case he said one more kiss
cant hurt

  and so he held her closer and kissed
her again
deal we do ji

ive

by lucinda baker

her job was to teach math to sol-
diers but one of her own stu-
dents proved to sue that
a two-some is more fun
than a lonesome

there was a new class that morn-
ing sue bower took her place
behind the huge desk with her
usual poise and assurance her dark
blue suit might have passed for a uniform
except for the crisp white blouse that

is love always like this peter sue asked
does it make you happy-and yet afraid of the
end




new love magazine

accentuated the gardenia whiteness of
her skin her rich brown hair was
parted in the middle and rolled neat-
ly in a little frame around her face
on other girls the hair style might
have been sophisticated but it detracted
from sues beauty and made her blue eyes
seem too big for her face

  but she was the perfect type for a
civilian instructor at the air force tech-
nical school in chicago although she was
only twenty-two she had taught school for
three years in a small ohio town when
the army sent out a call for instructors in
mathematics she was happy to serve her
country in the way she knew best she
had majored in math and had never jiad
an opportunity to use it

  the army approved her appearance as
well as her brain power she wasnt the
distracting type her work was important
the men who navigated planes and
bombed difficult targets had to know com-
plicated arithmetic and sue never forgot
her duty by trying to act as if she w-ere
lana turner

  sometimes she sort of wished someone
would ask her to forget her duty say for
a date or two every week her model
roommate joan was always telling her
its just that you dont know how to ex-
press your beauty what you need is a
lot of lipstick and clothes to show off that
figure of yours why if i had your
chance id be rationing dates

  now sue put on her spectacles with
tortoise-shell rims which were awe-in-
spiring to her students good morning
she said with dignity sue never had to
cope with flirtation i am miss bower
shall we begin

  it was at that precise moment she sud-
denly felt as if someone were staring at
her maybe her slip was showing it
wasnt but a young man in the last seat
of the front row was looking at her in-
tently sue blushed and then she realized
that his eyes were mostly amused rather
than flirtatious and just a tiny bit disbe-
lieving

  looking at him in return was quite a
shock in all her twenty-two years no
man had had the same effect on her it
was as if she couldnt live another minute
without knowing him better and it cer-
tainly had nothing to do with mathe-

matics she could have coped with that

  he was about twenty-seven and his
eyes were as brown as her own hair full
of gold sparkles that meant danger he
had unruly close-cropped brown curls
which he probably hated he was tall
even sitting down and he looked the way
a man in uniform ought to look flat and
hard and broad shouldered he gave her
a small salute and a grin

  she thought youre laughing at me
not with me and she looked away care-
fully pretending she hadnt noticed we
will proceed with the problems for today

every day for a week she was ter-
ribly conscious of him there in the
front row and this class was different
from the ones that had gone before it
had an air of gayety about it and some-
how sue knew that private peter murray
was to blame

  then one night just as she was leaving
the building he was waiting outside
hello miss bower he began may i
talk to you about something

  of course sue said her heart was
beating a tattoo against her ribs

  its about that newest theory you ex-
plained to us i cant quite get it
her heart stopped pounding and went
back to normal ill help if i can

  i certainly would appreciate it peter
continued taking her brief case

  the wondered desperately what to say
next he was evidently seeing her home
actually arithmetic is fascinating she
began it isnt difficult if you get started
right

  youre a girl and yet you think in
terms of algebra and geometry there
was awe in his voice

  she said defensively people dont
know how interesting those subjects are
but she knew she really didnt care

  peter helped her aboard a double-deck-
er bus miss bower did you ever
stop to think that maybe youre missing
a lot i mean youve been teaching this
new class a w-eek and nobody knows
anything about you you discourage all
attempts at getting acquainted you act-
sort of frozen

  sue said crisply my job is to teach
arithmetic to soldiers not to provide a
central heating system
teach me to live



  dont be angry please peter argued
anxiously i know im barging in but
i like to see everybody happy and from
the first day ive noticed your eyes are
sad you look afraid as if life were pass-
ing you by what you need is to thaw out
its easy if you know how

  sues heart had started going too fast
again but she wasnt angry any more
peter murrays voice somehow prevented
that it was so quiet and friendly and
there was something about it she couldnt
have explained something that made her
go on listening

  what i wanted to suggest peter
went on politely is that if you would
help me with the toughest mathematical
problems off duty that is id show you
how to let go and have fun oh i know
that sounds presumptuous but i know all
about you you look as if life were just
a problem in geometry but it isnt sue
every day ought to be exciting

  and you    really think i could
learn she asked hesitantly reminding
herself that there was nothing personal in
the suggestion it was just a bargain a
busines transaction

  you ought to be dating a different
soldier every night peter asserted
and you could he sketched a vivid
future youre cute under that icy ex-
terior all you need is to be taught how
to have fun

  sue couldnt be angry she knew he
was right peters brown eyes had pene-
trated the icy wall between her and hap-
piness joan would have told him to run
along that she could run her own life

  but she didnt say that she knew she
would grasp at any chance which let her
be near peter muray all right she
said ill help you with mathematics and
you    can teach me how to live
how about beginning tonight he
suggested im at liberty for several
hours we could get off this bus and go to
a place i know where we could have din-
ner and dance and then well fix a
time to study

  she knew in her heart that for a chance
to go with peter she would have agreed
to almost any idea so she said all
right peter if you really think itll be
worth my help tutoring you

  i really do he grinned when

were finished ill be a mathematical
shark and youll be the siren of the army
air force technical school

  they went to a little cafe on rush
street where the specialty of the house
was spaghetti and you chose your music
from hundreds of records they danced
and sue had the sensation of floating in a
dream

  peter kept speaking to people he knew
and his grin was a bright magnet warm
as sunshine sue felt suddenly alone in
the midst of the music thinking of how
terrible it would be to go back to a life
that didnt include his smile and yet
she would have to unless she somehow
miraculously became the kind of girl he
went for

  after they danced some more and had
dinner it was time to go outside they
walked a little while down michigan ave-
nue thanks for tonight she told him
almost wistfully i guess you were right
what i need is to thaw out i didnt know
how to start

  youve started now peter grinned
she was crazily thankful that he needed
help in mathematics

the next day she went to class in a
dress she had considered too festive
before it was beige with a red belt and a
bright red patch pocket she didnt just
imagine it the class was different that
morning several of the men smiled at her
when she was explaining problems the
smiles were almost flirtatious amused but
sue ignored the amusement

  peter came that evening for his first
lesson he had to leave early but they
had time for some intensive work before
they began sue asked im doing better
already dont you think

  peter pretended to examine her you
certainly are several of the fellows in
class noticed too before the term is
over youll be dating all of them

  but i want just to date you she
almost said it aloud to cover embarrass-
ment she hurriedly began explaining a
difficult problem peter listened all eve-
ning he wasnt nearly as ignorant about
figures as she had thought he learned
very easily if he had any difficulties it
was probably because he was occasionally
lazy

  he was just preparing to go when joan
came home to dress for a late date she
was adorable all gold and cream loveli-
ness sue couldnt miss the look that
passed between joan and peter it was
a look of genuine interest of challenge
the kind of look peter had never given
sue

  suddenly she knew she was dreaming a
desperate dream to think peter would
ever think of her as anything but a good
deed

  joan was saying i believe i know
peter we met at a party

  tom graysons wasnt it peter re-
membered or else he was just inventing
on the spur of the moment this is the
first chance ive had to really see you at
the party the stag line was three deep
around you 

  a few minutes later he had gone and
there was panic in sues heart peter
didnt belong to her and she knew it he
was just doing a good deed

  joan took off her make-up so peter
is the one responsible for the change in
you sue i was sure you looked differ-
ent

  sue protested im afraid that was an
optical illusion im just helping peter
with his studies

  thats a relief peter murray is strict-
ly for smarties he lost his amateur rating
as prince charming long ago you cant
be an amateur and date him without get-
ting hurt

  sue felt incredibly that something in-
side her was slowly freezing the first
time she saw him she had known he was
smooth and popular

  the next morning she used a new
shade of lipstick painting her lips just the
way joan did into a shining red curve
which dominated her pale small face the
pallor didnt just come from not wearing
rouge but from a strained feeling about
her heart

  one of the students asked her eyes
mockingly humorous miss bower
youre slipping if you wear that much
lipstick we arent going to keep our
minds on our work its sabotage in a
way

  in fact the whole attitude of the class
seemed changed even though it wasnt
expressed in words sue could sense it

it was as if every one of the soldiers were
watching seeing the ice melt away from
her but she didnt care in fact she was
glad

it was friday night and peter made
a date for saturday its your turn
sue tomorrow night well polish up on
the fine points of a sirens technique
he grinned of course there are some
things you have to pick up for yourself
forget about mathematics and let your-
self go

  sue thought i dont want to be a siren
except to you i like the way you laugh
the way you know life will always be
thrilling but aloud she said ive made
up my mind to make a success of this
problem

  it isnt a problem thats been your
trouble life has been all problems in
mathematics and no fun

  she knew it would make her late but
she went shopping after class she was
reckless extravagant and told the sales-
girl i want something dangerous some-
thing for a siren

  for you miss she was asked
dubiously

  but in the end she found just what she
wanted a black chiffon formal appliqued
with black chantilly lace

  as she selected new makeup she
studied her own image and was aston-
ished her eyes were lustrous her lips
parted in expectation her chin reckless
with determination if peter murray
liked sirens she would be one time was
getting short she knew that he would
be finding someone who didnt have to be
taught about life

  she even had time for a quick hairdo
that saturday afternoon in a down-town
salon her dark brown curls were cut
short feathery and sweet about her face
turning it into an ivory heart

  peter was already waiting for her when
she reached the apartment he and joan
were carrying on an intimate conversation
joan said brightly ive entertained him
sue darling he told me all about your
agreement i think its the best thing that
ever happened to you honestly i do

  it was as if someone had thrown cold
water in sues face she hated having
joan know the truth
teach me to live



  peter said dark brows amused joan
could give you some hints her code
matches mine shes always ready for a
thrill so thrills never pass her by

  joan purred yes darling ive tried
to explain it before but you never seemed
interested but now that youre out of
your coccoon heres the lowdown be
carefree expect life to hold something
romantic every day and remember
that a two-some is more fun than a lone-
some

  sue said defiantly id rather find out
by myself joan

  she went to her room and while she
was dressing joans date called for her
so when sue came into the sitting room
peter was alone he was playing the
spinet piano and his back was turned to
sue

  that joan is bad for a mans peace
of mind he said with a laugh

  sue said im ready

  when he turned his face mirrored his
surprise but only for a moment then he

grinned the old easy-going lets-have-
fun peter murray grin hi here siren
shall we go

they went to camellia house and
the buttery and the chez paris
sues feet moved magically to the music
though perhaps it was because peter
knew how to guide them anyway the
evening was a success before it was an
hour old sue forgot to think

  as they were leaving camellia house
it started to snow when they went from
one place to the next just down the street
the white flakes clung to sues hair to
her eyelashes and her laughter was muted
in the white softness

  they turned in at a door and in the
soft glow of the light peter looked down
at her sue its nothing short of a
miracle the way youve changed

  her voice was shaken i guess im
your star pupil everything is different
ill never be afraid to live again ive
missed so much

new love magazine

  she wanted to tell him that the miracle
was love

  sue peter said and his eyes did not
leave hers he lifted her off her feet and
kissed her lips sue youre    very
sweet very lovely

  somehow she had always known that
kissing peter was sure to be like this a
sweet tide of feeling sweeping everything
else aside and she had known that after
she kissed him life would never be the
same again

  it was very simple really the simplest
mathematical equation in the world this
was love it was a word you read about
and then it happened to you

  peter was looking at her almost as if he
were seeing a stranger and she said not
really knowing how it sounded is love
always like this peter  does it make you
happy and yet afraid it may end she
laughed uncertainly i guess youve real-
ly-thawed me out

  a crowd came out of the door ruining
the moment and sue went on inside with
peter following it was noisy and crowd-
ed and they didnt have time to talk
but it was enough to dance with peter and
to realize over and over again that she
had known his kiss

  a little later he discovered there was
just time to put her in a taxi and get back
to his quarters the night had vanished
almost weirdly it might almost have been
a dream

  when sue came in joan was already
removing her makeup hello darling
she said you look as if a star had ex-
ploded in your hands and covered you
with glitter dust or am i wrong

  ive missed so much joan sue
said ive been locked in a cage of ice

  or a cage of mathematics joan said

  sue didnt tell her about peter she
wanted to keep the knowledge of her love
secret for a while

  all the next day there were no mes-
sages on the telephone stand and all after-
noon the telephone stayed maddeningly
still sue spent sunday afternoon wash-
ing her hose and doing various odds and
ends and still nothing happened noth-
ing that is until after she had gone to
bed

  there was the sound of a key rattling
in the lock and joans voice breathless

saying thanks peter ill never forget
today nobody ever took me on a winter
picnic before you have wonderful ideas
life will never be dull for you

  before the door closed plainly as any-
thing sue heard peters voice thanks
joan youre pretty exciting yourself
youre the kind of girl a soldier dreams
of being stranded with some place
then there was a short silence long
enough for a kiss before the door closed

  sue was trembling with anger and
heartbreak when joan turned on the light
you dated peter she gasped when
you knew  her face flamed as she
realized she was a fool to show her feel-
ings

  joan took off her sweater and skirt
she said listen sue all i knew was
that you had some sort of business ar-
rangement with peter you were going
to teach him mathematics in return for a
few helpful hints on being a success with
men he may have been romantic with
you last night but dont you know you
should never take a man of peters type
too seriously just because you dated
him once doesnt mean its permanent
men like peter dont play for keeps
sue turned off the light would you
mind undressing in the bathroom she
asked joan i want to go to sleep
what she meant was that she wanted to
hide there in the dark in case she cried

  all her life she had been facing facts
so that was what she did now joan was
right peter hadnt said i love you
he had just kissed her and shed jumped
to conclusions without waiting she had
certainly arrived at the wrong answer
shed flunked at love even if she was a
whiz at geometry both she and peter
were successful teachers he knew about
life and she could do complicated arith-
metic

in the morning she had to go to school
as usual she didnt want to but she
knew her duty she was a little late after
trying to do something about her tear-
ravaged eyes

  but now she was her new self short
bob perky and cute lipstick shiny and
bright as a models she wore one of
joans bright sweathers it was very
effective she could tell that when she
went up to her class-room
teach me to live



  it was in perfect order of course for
this was the army but she could almost
feel the little gasp of attention that went
over the men as she took her place
sternly she began the lesson not looking
at peter murray but she could sense his
presence it was a savage torture she was
going to have to endure learn to ignore

  but how can you ignore heartbreak
instead of standing there in her new hair-
do and makeup and scarlet sweater she
wanted to run away and hide

  the class was finally dismissed as the
men filed past her desk she heard one of
them say very low my money was on
peter murray he knows his girls as he
does his arithmetic he was an account-
ant in civilian life and he certainly trans-
formed teacher

  peter was one of the last to go out but
he didnt march with the rest he said
sue whats wrong with you

 somehow she managed to speak
through stiff cold lips youd better go
peter i learned about your little joke by
accident just a second ago i guess i
should have known it all the time i
should have guessed i should have
known last night when you dated joan
as long as she lived she would remem-
ber his eyes intent on her as she went
on recklessly it was sweet of you to
help me especially since you knew all
about mahematics any way you dont
need asistance with anything do you
she turned to go but he held her his
fingers tight about her shoulders listen
sue im risking plenty by talking to you
when i ought to be on my way to another
class so youve got to let me talk

  she struggled let me go i was silly
to take for granted that your kissing me
was more than a part of my education
you taught me how to live and ill never
forget the lesson i guess learning it was
a little hard but after today it will never
hurt me again

  thats a lie he accused his mouth
was hard determined if you dont let
me finish there will never be a moment

when the memory of this doesnt hurt
you the truth is sue i made the date
with joan before you and i went out you
were late getting home and  i guess i
still thought of myself as footloose sue
try to understand this    every man is an
adventurer until he finds the right girl
conquest is fun when i saw joan i
guess i acted according to habit he
stopped then began again i didnt know
i loved you sue until later when i kissed
you you cant hate me for that i doubt
if you knew it either it took me all day
to realize that i didnt want to date joan
or anyone else and that though i was sup-
posedly trying to teach you how to live
i was getting an education myself i was
learning how to love i didnt ever want
you to know about the joke part it was
just that soldiers have fun they have to
make a joke out of everything else i
made a bet that you could be a siren un-
derneath that icy exterior and i was
right but-im sorry sue im sorry
and i want to forget it all i want to do
is to love you

  youre sorry for me she retorted
anguished please peter dont make it
any worse by being sorry

  it would take more than sympathy to
make me go awol from my next
class he told her ill meet you out-
side the hotel when youre finished he
kissed the tip of her nose i cant go
through the day with lipstick on my face
so that will have to do he said and
remember darling when i transform a
girl into a siren i want her for myself
just ignore any soldiers you see except
me

  it was a small kiss not like the one of
two nights before but she knew suddenly
that he wasnt sorry for her he shared
her thankfulness for love he disappeared
around the corner in the hall and she
wished intently that it were evening and
he was waiting for her outside

  she stood there not sensing the pas-
sage of time a star had really exploded
in her hands flooding her life with a spray
of what joan had called glitter dust

paul vickers took models in his
stride until julias lovely face
came before his camera and her
beauty teas such a sacred thing to
him that to save her from heart-
break he hoped to keep her from
success

he tried to concentrate on the music on the
fragrance of babs black hair but his eyes were
drawn to those two at the table


slap in fjeaven

-by virginia nielsen-

paul vickers puffed reflectively
on his pipe as he looked at the slight
rather pale girl before him be-
hind his glasses his nice-looking young
eyes were sizing her up shrewdly

  her prettiness was of the elfin variety
there was a touch of wistfulness a hint
that once her shyness evaporated she
could be merry her clothes did not fit
well and she wore practically no makeup
but that wasnt his job

  he thought he saw what kip saunders
saw in her-an elusive sprite-like charm
that was quite new and refreshing kips
enthusiasms seldom went wrong and over
the telephone he had been nearly incoher-
ent rhapsodizing about his latest dis-
covery

  paul put down his pipe so you want
to be a model he growled unencourag-
ingly

  yes she said and smiled at him

  he felt a curious contraction some-
where inside him the girl was an idiot




new love magazine

she shouldnt look at anyone as trustingly
as that

  he said crossly why dont you go
back to the farm this is a racket and a
tough one

  there was a shy teasing in her laughter
that surprised him they told me you
would be like this

  yeah who told you

  she blushed but stood her ground the
girls over at mr saunders they said
you were a barking dog the kind that
doesnt bite

  he made a noise in his throat and turn-
ing away from her fired some instruc-
tions at his assistant

  all right he said to her so your
mind is made up lets get going
obediently she pulled off her hat her
hair was fine like corn-silk and it had
the same soft gold in it she combed it
in the dressing room he indicated while
he fussed with his lights and the big
camera the assistant had wheeled in
place

  she came back looking at him with a
shy expectant smile and her eyes plainly
said go ahead and scold me it doesnt
matter i can tell by the twinkle in your
eye that you dont really mean it i think
youre really very nice

  what could you do but be nice to a
girl like that grudgingly paul ex-
plained dont expect these pictures to
flatter you these i make just to help
saunders

  she sat docilely while he arranged her
under the big flat lights but her gaze
was quick with interest how can un-
flattering pictures help him

  shows him how much room there is
for improvement paul said dryly

  color washed over her pale face and he
thought thin-skinned little thing

  after she had gone he took out the
plates and went into the dark room to
develop them he was conscious of an
impatience he had not felt for a long time
as soon as he could he ran off prints
and held them up to scrutinize them care-
fully

  unflattering though they were the pic-
tures definitely heightened her personality
there was mystery and invitation and
teasing laughter in her eyes and her smile
was captivating it was that way some-

times the camera gave a girl a personality
she scarcely knew she had

  paul vickers stood a long time studying
the prints his pipe between his lips she
would be a success all right he thought
and felt a troubling foreboding because
she wasnt the type who could get along
in this game

the next time she came to his studio
she carried a swank hatbox the badge
of the working model she walked a little
straighter her makeup was perfect and
a new hairdo gave a lovelier oval to her
face

  hello she said and he was immeas-
urably pleased to see that she was still a
little shy

  hello miss forrester he said and
added quizzically or is that still your
name

  she laughed and he thought it was a
pity the camera couldnt capture the sound
of it yes kip is going to let me keep
my own name he thinks julia is quaint
he says there are enough girls named
candy and babs and gloria already she
laughed again the studio seemed a
warmer brighter place with her in it

  so its kip already he said dryly

  she looked a little startled then blushed
and was silent as he arranged for her
picture

  paul was silent too he knew saun-
derss way of playing his latest discovery
for a favorite someday there would be a
bounce for julia forrester for there was
always a new favorite there had to be
in this business

  it was a good thing paul thought
grimly that he had long ago steeled his
heart to the lovely young models he photo-
graphed day after day not only to their
beauty but to the young helpless appeal of
the new ones like this forrester girl it
was the only thing to do

  you could break your heart over
them he told sarah bickers the elderly
but not at all unlively aunt who kept
house for him in his apartment around
the corner from his studios

  im surprised you dont she teased
him

  he made an exclamation of disgust
theyre in a tough racket he said as
he had said so often and what brings
star in my heaven



them in vanity vanity and a thirst
for cheap fame if they are too soft to
take it they can blame no one but them-
selves can they

  well his aunt sarah said a bit
acidly i suppose you have paid for
the right to speak your mind the softest
touch in town thats what you are to
models they can always count on a loan
from you when they start going down-
hill

  with a grunt paul retired behind his
evening paper ignoring his aunts chuckle
he read the gossip columns regular-
ly now for julia was starting to appear in
them that was part of saunders tech-
nique he squired his latest favorite to
all the places where cafe society gathered
he dressed her and let her be seen he
enjoyed hearing people say her face is
so familiar but where have i seen her be-
fore

  julia frankly gloried in her success
she came very often to pauls studio sent
by one or another of saunders customers
her loveliness was more polished now
but in spite of the poise she was acquir-
ing she recounted each triumph to paul
with a naivete like that of a little girl just
home from school and full of what had
happened she seemed bubbling with hap-
piness

  as the months wore on however there
was another difference in her she began
looking a little tired paul began greet-
ing her with what time did you go to
bed last night it was seldom early

  one day he said grimly when they hap-
pened to be alone in the studio saun-
ders isnt going to like these pictures
her eyes widened why

  your late hours are going to show
up in them he said to say nothing of
those last three drinks

  she wrinkled her nose and laughed at
him but he bought the drinks

  laugh while you can beautiful paul
said if youre tired of being a model
its no concern of mine there are plenty
of models and you can always find an-
other job

  her elfin face was suddenly breath-
takingly radiant paul she said ill
tell you a secret it isnt the job that mat-
ters any more

  his heart sank no

  she shook her head no she said
it isnt the job now its the boss

  paul groaned out loud you little
idiot

  she stared at him looking a little hurt
for once unable to laugh off his gruff-
ness

  he straightened and put down his pipe
i figured you were one girl who might
be able to keep her head in this crazy
business he told her bitterly cant
you see that kip has only been building
you up its always this way with each
new one he discovers shes the only star
in his heaven as long as she is new then
-plop thats the goods beautiful and
everyone in the business knows it one
every year for saunders each year a
new favorite

  she laughed a little uncertainly paul
you old grumbler you are a bad-weather
prophet but you dont fool me youre
just trying to scare me into getting some
sleep arent you

  im not trying to scare you im only
trying to pound a little sense into your
pretty head

  he came closer to her surprisingly he
was really angry his heart was beating
hard with anger he took off his glasses
and looked at her with a sober intensity
in his dark eyes that she could not laugh
away

  im not teasing you he said quietly
why else do you suppose kip is so
successful unless its because he can al-
ways work up enthusiasm for a new
type last year it was the wheat girl
the clean earthy country beauty-linda
adams youve heard of her you know
what kind of jobs she gets now buff
pushed her until the advertisers were sick
of her face now youre it the elfin
type next year it will be someone dif-
ferent and where will you be

  he stopped a little surprised at his own
intensity she was sitting in the prop
chair staring up at him her eyes wide
and her face a little pale he had got
under that thin skin of hers all right

  i can tell you where you will be he
said brutally and it isnt going around
with stars in your eyes

  she winced and he turned away trying
not to be sorry for her it was something
she should be told


new love magazine

  they finished the pictures in silence
and she was either thoughtful or offended
she left with a brief bye and he began
swearing to himself as he got ready for
the next job

  the look in her eyes stayed with him
he thought maybe im wrong i hope
maybe saunders is going to marry her
but the thought gave him no comfort
and anyway he knew better

  he growled at his next appointment a
newcomer why didnt you stay on the
farm

  and milk cows with these hands the
girl said pertly

  he grunted they were good hands
but there was nothing in her face to help
her make the grade it was too bad be-
cause she wasnt soft

  n spite of his predictions julias
star continued to rise not for several
years had saunders had a model so suc-
cessful paul thought he knew why her
beauty was not the kind one tired of a
man might always find new things to ad-
mire in her clear laughing eyes in the
shine of her hair and the haunting elfin
expression of her face

  but the advertising public was fickle
he reminded himself cynically the end
would come and there was that old
saw about the higher the limb-or some-
thing like that

  when the fall came it was in a way
paul could not have anticipated

  he picked up the evening papers after
one of aunt sarahs satisfying dinners
and saw a headline

photographers model in ac-
cident

  julias name leaped up at him he felt
a cold chill and at the same time a quick
revulsion because the story was disgust-
ingly splashy

  paul grabbed the telephone and shout-
ed at the inoffensive operator when he
had kip saunders on the line he said
what about julia

  oh hello paul ive just come from
the hospital im afraid shes a total loss
her face you see-

  my god im not calling professional-
ly paul cried how badly is she hurt
will she pull through it

  oh yes im sorry if i sounded un-
feeling old man kip apologized easily
i thought you knew there was little
damage except to her head and face and
they soon were satisfied there is no con-
cussion of course she is suffering from
severe shock

  where is she

  kip named the hospital and paul
thanked him shortly and hung up

  aunt sarah was clucking sympathetical-
ly what a terrible thing how did it
happen 

  its all in the paper i suppose he
was not interested in how just now he
was rushing back and forth across the
room looking very young and distraught
im going to the hospital they prob-
ably wont let me see her but ive got to
try anyway

  a taxi accident aunt sarah ex-
claimed bending her head over the paper
as he was on his way out of the apart-
ment she said paul theyve used one
of your pictures-

  he swore at her and never realized he
was doing it

  they wouldnt let him see her that first
night he realized finally that he could
not talk his way past the starched white
dragons at her door and so he went
down the street to a bar where he sat for
a long gloomy time over a drink

  the next evening they let him see her
for a few minutes she looked unbeliev-
ably slight under the white hospital cover-
let and the bandages that almost com-
pletely covered her head and face gave a
twist to his heart

  but her eyes laughed up at him as clear
and as happy as ever paul how nice
of you to come

  dont you know enough to stay out
of taxis he growled what are you
trying to do put yourself out of the
business

  not at all grumpy ill be back un-
der those horrid lights of yours in no
time

  dont hurry he pleaded im en-
joying a rest it was give me miss for-
rester in a bathing suit miss forrester on
skis miss forrester in this or that uni-
form or miss forrester enjoying a ciga-
rette until i was sick of the girl

  she sighed contentedly i have been
star in my heaven



busy havent i maybe i needed a rest
buff told me not to worry about a thing
isnt that sweet of him he is talcing
care of everything

  he ought to

  julia sighed again hardboiled as
ever arent you but her eyes laughed
up at him

  paul did not smile

  the nurse said thats all for this
time and he went soberly away worried
for her

a few days later kip saunders called
him at the studio

  paul he said his deep voice vi-
brant with excitement paul could see
him at his desk big and broad shouldered
and confident paul im sending over a
new girl shes on her way now hart-
well her name is babs hartwell
another babs paul said dryly
saunders ignored his interruption
shes terrific shes the type ive been
looking for vickers dark and sophisti-
cated yet sweet if you get it and plenty
of come-hither in her eyes if her pic-
tures turn out as i expect them to shes
going up like a rocket in fact she wont
have to go up she can practically start
at the top i can have the big fellows beg-
ging for her in a couple of weeks

  sounds good paul said still in that
dry flat tone kip saunders optimism
reacted on him like a mouthful of vinegar
how is julia

 who oh julia forrester the
vibrant excitement noticeably faded from
kips voice well ill tell you frankly
vickers there isnt much chance shell
be able to come back the doctors are
doing a wonderful job on her face im
sure and of course its too soon to tell
but there is apt to be a certain stiffness in
those made-over faces ever photograph
one of them

  paul wet his lips no he said
cant fool a camera you know he
laughed his hearty confident laugh i
should lie telling you

  yeah paul said he put down the
phone his teeth clenched tight over his
pipe and his knuckles were white as he
walked up and down the studio

  before his anger had worn off babs
hartwell arrived his first look at her

told him she was a natural for success
she had that kind of flawless beauty that
artists paint yet there was enough in-
dividuality in her features so one would
not forget them

  he knew just by looking at her that
she would be photogenic from almost any
angle besides that she had sparkle and
life the wiseness in her inviting eyes
tantalized and she was not in the least
shy

  paul put on his gruff act so you want
to be a model do you what percentage
do you think there is in it anyway

  she smiled a little suppose you let
me worry about that she said

  she would get ahead all right no need
to worry about her paul posed her and
shot rapid fire pictures-full face three
quarters full length right and left pro-
file and sent her back to saunders

  he ducked out of the studio then and
ordered a big basket of fruit and an arm-
load of flowers and all the latest magazines
sent to the hospital

  in the weeks tat followed he watched
babs hartwells star rise with a pain he
found it hard to reason away

  i should quit this business he told
himself im getting soft

  it was clear from the start that kip
saunders was behind the hartwell girl
with all his dynamic energy when she
came to pauls studio she didnt chatter
about her appointments the way julia had
done but he knew that she was already
very busy

  she had a quiet business-like way of
getting things done which she hid behind a
deceivingly languorous air it was a funny
thing but babs hardness didnt show in
the pictures it almost didnt show up at
all she was so lovely to look at you
forgot about the little gleam m her eyes
that was nothing but calculation

  if paul had not been so familiar with
beauty as to be unimpressed by it he
might have missed that look of hers that
catalogued him attractive useful-but not
importantly so he knew it he had seen
it in girls eyes before

  one night he ran into her at a popular
nightclub she was with kip who was
almost swaggering as he showed her off
feeling a little sickened paul left quietly
to avoid meeting them


new love magazine

  the next evening he loaded himself
down with flowers and candy and went
to the hospital

  he found julia thinner and quieter
she was pleased to see him and touch-
ingly appreciative of his gifts but she
plucked nervously at the coverlet as they
talked

  at last she said theyre going to re-
move the bandages at ten tomorrow paul
kip is coming she hesitated i-ive
almost forgotten what i look like im so
used to being a mummy there was
apprehension in her voice

  he picked up her pale hand and held
it warmly between his now i know
youre well he said vanity rears its
ugly head will i still be beautiful
she wonders his tone was lightly jeer-
ing

  she moved impatiently vanity noth-
ing she said a little edge in her voice
my looks are my bread and butter re-
member

  the camera never did justice to your
most beautiful feature paul said your
beauty is in your eyes julia and they
still have that clear golden look that no
photograph has ever captured your eyes
are all i can see now but they havent
changed

  they were moist all of a sudden and
her lashes swept down to hide them
from him but her hand which had been
lying passive in his returned his grasp

  she said with her old shyly teasing
laughter paul ive never heard you so
un-grumpy have you fallen in love while
ive been here

  he flushed and stood up to go theres
nothing wrong with you he told her
dryly i think that doctor is keeping you
here just to keep you out of mischief
her laughter floated to the door with
him

tte could not keep his mind on his
work the next morning the time
moved in slow deliberate minutes ten
oclock came at last and after that the
clock on his studio wall seemed to stand
still at nearly noon his assistant told
him kip was on the telephone

  paul was conscious only of the beating
of his own heart

  yes saunders

  hello paul im sending babs over
this afternoon heres what i want you
to do he went on with enthusiasm out-
lining an idea he wanted to present to a
customer

  paul listened emotion swelling un-
pleasantly within him when kip had
finished he said surprised to find his
voice slightly thick youve seen julia
what kip seemed to come back
from a long way off oh of course
julia forrester coincidence your men-
tioning her i just came from the hospital
they removed the bandages this morn-
ing

  yes paul said impatiently
successful operation very but the
photogenic angles are ruined naturally
too bad

  there was a subtle change in his voice
he sounded detached a little vague too
bad paul thought that swelling feeling
hurting his chest

  of course she was about through
anyway kip said casually they dont
last long in this game do they vickers
we know that the public wants novelty
and babs hartwell has it theyre crazy
about her

  paul controlled himself with an effort
it was all true he had said the same
things over and over again he had
told julia this would happen but he
still had an overwhelming desire to lay
his hands on kip saunders and violently
for the man must know that julia was in
love with him

  he said about hartwell im sorry
but i cant take her this afternoon im
pretty busy

  kip sounded annoyed cant you
squeeze her in

  cant be done today ill try tomor-
row

  look vickers this is important-
tomorrow paul said and slammed
down the phone

  he said to his assistant ill be out
all afternoon and turned his back on
the fellows wide stare

  he didnt stop to buy flowers or maga-
zines this time he went straight to the
hospital and was admitted at once to
julias room it was sunny and filled with
flowers she was sitting up in bed wear-
ing a pretty bed jacket and her hair was
star in my heaven



like a golden cloud around her face

  hello beautiful he said

  she didnt smile there was a fright-
ened cringing look in her eyes as she
sought his first reaction he sat down by
the bed and reaching over took her chin
in his hand turning her face from side
to side he looked it over quizzically at
last he said mind if i kiss it

  she drew her breath in a quick little
gasp he bent over and kissed her square-
ly on the lips got to christen it you
know he observed dryly

  she began to laugh but her laughter
got all tangled up in tears oh paul
you clown is-is it so terrible

  feeling unbearably awkward paul re-
treated into his familiar comfortable
gruffness

  so now she wants me to tell her how
beautiful she is whats the matter 
wont they let you have a mirror

  she didnt snap back at him as he hoped
she would she just looked at him sadly
and said i know im lucky paul there
wont be a scar i look a little strange to
myself a little stiff but ill get used to
that its just that-well i know i am
through modeling kip didnt say much
but-

  pauls heart ached with a dull hurting
anger he could imagine so well the
scene that occurred this morning he
knew exactly how saunders must have
done it-going all vague and impersonal
all of a sudden he was a master at
backing out of a situation

- paul said unhappily the camera sees
things we dont but is that so im-
portant

  no julia said after a long pause

  they were talking around the bush
and they both knew it paul could sense
so clearly that what hurt her most was the
realization that kips interest was ending
along with her career

pie felt an impotent anger there was
no way for him to relieve it without curs-
ing saunders he sat beside her bed and
felt the blood pound in his temples
when can you leave this place

  she hesitated most any time she
said

  he waited

  kip has been grand he-he has
taken care of all the bills

  paul said but you havent any mon-
ey i suppose models never do

  she colored

  so that was it kip had paid her hos-
pital bills and washed his hands of her
abruptly paul stood up and walked out
of the room

  he didnt wait for the elevator but
walked quickly down the steps to the
office on the first floor can miss for-
rester leave today he inquired

  youll have to get permission from her
doctor the woman told him

  then get him on the phone

  when paul was determined he usually
got his own way by five oclock he had
julia looking pale but starry eyed with
excitement bundled into a taxi and on
her way to his apartment where aunt
sarah warned by telephone was already
fussing with preparations for the con-
valescent

taul whistled a little tune as he
selected a tie spending considerably
more time at it than he usually did he

settled finally on a rather gay one gave
an extra combing to his crispish dark
hair and went into breakfast still whis-
tling

  his aunt was already sitting at the head
of the small table good morning she
said with a little smile and poured his
cup of coffee

  where is she paul asked

  still asleep of course did you ex-
pect her to get up to have breakfast with
you

  of course not he said indignantly
i merely-

  then why are you wearing that tie
she chuckled what a change julia has
brought to our little household

  nonsense paul said annoyed

  decidedly a change for the better
his aunt teased him i like having you
come to breakfast with your hair all nice
and smooth and whistling at this hour
of the morning

  youre a romantic old spinster paul
growled

  but the truth was that the apartment
had become a different place for him since
he had brought julia to it he found
himself hurrying home after his last ap-
pointment at the studio instead of stop-
ping for a glass of beer or a highball with
some of his friends if he stopped at all
it was to pick up some flowers to take
home or a book he thought julia might
like

  her appreciation of even the smallest
gift gave him the keenest pleasure he had
ever known he delighted in thinking
up little surprises to relieve the monot-
ony of her convalescence his aunt teased
him slyly and even that pleased him in
some obscure way

  julia was growing stronger but she was
still very thin he scolded her about her
eating bringing home certain delicacies
to tempt her appetite

  he could tell when she started to grow
restless to worry about crowding them
after the first night when he slept on the
livingroom couch and let her use his
room aunt sarah put a studio couch in
her room for julia

  for several days it was apparent that
she wanted to talk to him but he antici-
pated what was coming and retreated in-
to his gruffness to put her off

  aunt sarah loved to play chess and in
the evenings after dinner she and julia
would set up a card table in front of the
fireplace while he read the paper

  more often than not his eyes would
stray over the top of the printed sheet to
julia he was fascinated by the way the
firelight brought out the warm tones in
her hair and skin the way she had of
half-closing her eyes while she studied her
next move

  he loved to watch her hands they
were not only beautiful but she handled
them gracefully and that gave him his
idea

  he spoke abruptly interrupting the
game julia i dont like to rush you
but i wonder if you are feeling well
enough to help me out at the studio im
in a spot

  her quick glance was startled sus-
picious color tinged her cheeks she said
what kind of a spot paul

  i was wondering if you would let me
photograph your hands for a job i have
he asked

  radiance spread over her face incredu-
lous at first then frank and unashamed
oh paul she cried id-id love
to

  she was nervous the first day she re-
turned to the camera but she was touch-
ingly glad to be working again he gave
her a diamond ring to put  and she
laughed and said its bad luck to put
an engagement ring on yourself and
made him slip it on her finger

  he could feel the color burning his
cheeks shes guessed he thought and
reflected how like a woman it was to tease
him with her knowledge

  she posed her hands for him several
times and she posed her legs for a stocking
ad when he tried to pay her she was
indignant

  apply it on what i owe you she
insisted and added w-armly not that i
can ever repay you paul

  he gave in finally understanding and
loving her independence

  she was in the studio when a lingerie
customer came in she begged for the
job anxiously

  no paul snapped

  but the customer looked her over and
he had to give it to her
star in my heaven



  paul stormed up and down the studio
for a while while julia patiently argued
that she couldnt afford to be fussy about
the jobs she took he finally gave in
but when she appeared before the camera
in frothy underthings he was filled with
such a chaos of tangled feelings-a burn-
ing important anger humiliation for her
and shame at his own desire-that he
turned the camera over to his surprised
assistant and walked out of the studio
until the job was done

  that night at the apartment julia told
aunt sarah how she had outraged his
modesty slyly teasing him with every
word his aunt looked at him shrewdly
and he felt the rage rising in him again
unreasonable and inexpressible

  julia must know why he could not pho-
tograph her in such intimate apparel she
could only be tormenting him

  after dinner he left without an explana-
tion and spent most of the evening in the
bar he used to frequent before she came
to the apartment as he brooded drink-
ing little he decided that he could stand
it no longer it was torment no man
could stand to have her so near day after
day loving her as he did he had to find
out if there was any chance for him any
chance at all even if it drove her away

  when he returned to the apartment
late julia was curled up in a corner of
the sofa with his discarded paper he
liked the way her blonde hair contrasted
with the deep sapphire of her velvet house
coat

  she looked up and smiled at him and he
thought she looked unbearably beautiful
he advanced toward her his heart beating
thickly for a silent moment they looked
at each other while he struggled for words
to say what he had to say

  she had dropped the paper to her lap
still open to an inside page he saw sud-
denly what she had been looking at it
was a picture of babs hartwell snapped
with kip saunders at the circle club

  she made a small gesture toward it
he thought her lips trembled slightly
i like you for many things paul she
said but i like you most of all for not
saying i told you so 

  he was powerless to speak the words
he had been forming died unspoken he
stood like a dummy while she rose quick-

ly to her feet and went out of the room
her soft good night was muffled and
he wondered painfully if she were crying

babs hartwell was giving

him the come-hither she was going
around with kip a lot he knew but she
was the kind of girl who wouldnt put
all her eggs in one basket

  she wants a cushion in case kip for-
gets to let her down easy he told himself
cynically

  but a man couldnt help responding
to the treatment from a girl as lovely as
babs even when he saw through her he
was photographing her more than any
other model and he didnt exactly look
forward to her appointments

  i never see you at any of the night
spots she told him her dark eyes were
warm and teasing dont you ever go
to the circle or are you the type who
plays poker with the boys

  he puffed thoughtfully on his pipe
how often do you go to the circle
club he asked

  babs laughed just a shade complacent-
ly you can count on me any saturday
night

  paul said ill be seeing you

  he left the studio early that afternoon
and went shopping - he knew what he
wanted exactly but he had a hard time
convincing the sales girls that he did he
could see julia in the dress he wanted
something as blue as her eyes cut low
enough to show off her lovely throat a
dress that hugged her tiny waist and had
lots of skirt

  the sales women shook their heads
over him but he clung stubbornly to his
mental picture of julia in blue and finally
came near to getting what he wanted

  he took the box under his arm and
started home with an exhilaration that
he remembered feeling at christmas he
was late getting home and the two women
were waiting dinner julia was sitting
under a lamp and her hair shone like
washed gold

  she looked up surprise widened her
eyes and anticipation colored her cheeks
as he put the box in her lap her fingers
trembled a little with excitement as she
pulled at the cord when the lid came
off and the tissue parted to reveal the blue

silky folds she gasped paul what-
put it on he said i want to see if
it fits you

  she said flustered and confused but
dinner is ready-

dinner can wait aunt sarah said
she stood up holding the dress up to
her in a purely feminine gesture paul
you shouldnt have-i cant let you-
she looked a little scared

  go put it on he urged i want to
see how good i am

  she went into the bedroom and aunt
sarah followed her almost as excited as
julia when they came out again a little
later jubas hair was piled on top of her
head she had put on some twinkly shoes
-and the blue dress paul nodded with
satisfaction it fitted perfectly

  julia was both disturbed and happy
but paul why-

  youre getting to be too much of a
homebody he said im going to take
you to the circle club

  she looked incredulous then she said
when paul

  he lit his pipe before replying sat-
urday he said

her excitement was touching and a
little frightening before her acci-
dent an evening at the circle would not
have meant so much to her paul made
himself edgy and miserable wondering if
it was the possibility of seeing kip saun-
ders that stirred her so he knew she had
gone there often with him in the old days
when the boss-not the job mattered

  just in time he remembered to send her
flowers youre lucky he told her
when she thanked him for them im
not the thoughtful type

  she laughed ive noticed that she
said with a tender note in her voice that
made prickles run along his spine but
it wasnt gratitude he wanted his edgi-
ness increased

  aunt sarah beamed on them both when
they were ready to leave paul called a
taxi and they went down to the foyer to
wait for it

  julia said you-you havent told me
how i look

  a little pale he said otherwise
quite lovely

  the taxi came and he put her into it

and gave the driver instructions julia
sat close to him and reached for his hand

  theres a special kind of beauty treat-
ment a girl needs sometimes she whis-
pered it-puts color in her cheeks and
gives her confidence-

  pauls pulses drummed he knew what
she meant he wondered again if she took
a pleasure in tormenting him almost
angrily he took her in his arms

  the hunger to hold her that he had sup-
pressed for so long surged over him he
held her close and kissed her as he had
always wanted to with a sigh she relaxed
in his arms and her lips clung sweet and
soft beneath his

  was she thinking of kip

  with an effort he put her away from
him hows that for treatment he
said his voice sounding rough in his ears

  she straightened that helps thank
you she said she sounded queerly re-
mote through the pounding that still filled
his ears

  for the rest of the ride they sat apart
in a rather stiff silence as soon as they
arrived at the club and were seated at
the table paul had had reserved he or-
dered champagne

  another beauty treatment he told
julia for she was still pale and her face
looked a little strained he realized that
she must be dreading meeting all the cafe
society acquaintances who had not seen
her since her accident

  he lifted his glass and said to the
loveliest girl here that brought a faint
smile to her lips

  almost at once people began crawling
around their table to greet julia the
supper he ordered was scarcely touched
for the dishes cooled and lost their inter-
est while they talked with friends and
acquaintances who stopped by julia was
looking happier and more like her old
self as they told her how lovely she
looked

  looking at her critically and as imper-
sonally as he could paul thought her
beauty was as arresting as ever with only
a haunting difference so slight you were
not sure what it was certainly only the
camera could single it out

  but he realized what a poor judge he
was his love for her had grown and
deepened so much since her accident that
star in my heaven



it seemed to him her beauty had grown
and deepened too

  the floor show was over and the lights
had just gone up again when babs hart-
well came in followed by kip saunders
babs saw him and waved he beckoned
to her and with a little smile she led kip
toward his table

  all eyes followed her she was wear-
ing white and her dark eyes and shining
dark hair made a striking contrast kip
towered behind her big and confident and
successful looking they were a strik-
ingly handsome couple

  paul stood up he spoke to kip then
greeted babs warmly devoting himself to
her so that he would not have to watch
julia greet kip but even though he
would not look at them his ears picked
up the sharp silence that fell between them
after they greeted each other

  youre a gorgeous creature tonight
paul said quickly to babs

  tonight she pouted

  he grinned dont quibble it isnt
often i make pretty speeches he ges-
tured to a chair sit here youll have
a drink with us wont you

  her dark intimate eyes seemed to speak
of secrets between them of course
she said smiling

  oh im sorry he said suddenly
flushing and introduced her to julia

  babs barely acknowledged julias greet-

ing and turned back to him paul
she said laying her hand on his arm
those bathing suit pictures you took of
me remember- she was off on a
story but he was conscious only of the
conversation that went on between kip
and julia

  he heard kip say its good to see
you julia ive missed you but though
he strained to hear her reply it was so
low he couldnt catch it

  kip said in an altered voice julia
you cant mean that feeling like an
eavesdropper paul suddenly stood up
and pulled babs to her feet

  lets dance he said excuse us
you two

  julia looked up at him with eyes that
were strangely dark her face was blank
kip nodded casually and his eyes never
left julias face

  feeling the blood rush to his head paul
led babs to the small polished square
where other couples were dancing

  she went into his arms with a snug-
gling movement you didnt hear a word
i said did you she said accusingly

  paul said i wanted to dance with
you

  she laughed softly and let herself move
closer to him he concentrated on his
steps  the music and on the fragrance
of her dark hair anything to keep from
watching those two at the table and won-

dering about the things they were saying
to each other

  the music ended julia and kip were
still talking so paul kept babs on the
floor paying her foolish compliments to
keep her from getting restless she was
playing up to him beautifully and he
decided it was to arouse kips jealousy

  its been tried before my girl he
thought cynically but he couldnt see any
point in warning her might as well warn
kip about her she wasnt like julia she
could take care of herself

  the third time they danced together
babs said happily kip is going to be
furious

  paul looked toward the table they had
deserted julia was sitting very straight
in her chair she looked angry and she
and kip were no longer talking

  perhaps wed better go back he
said he felt a pounding anger rise in
him again wondering what kip had said
to make julia look like that he thought
if i could just hit him once-

  babs walked ahead of him back to the
table julia jumped up as they came
near her eyes were dark and bright and
her face was pale

  if you are through dancing with miss
hartwell she said icily id like to go j
kips face was expressionless he stood
up so she could pass him with the grace
of an angry queen she walked away from
them paul muttered an excuse and fol-
lowed her feeling utterly wretched be-
cause he was powerless to help her

  he caught up with her near the door
he said julia im sorry-

  she turned on him white and furious
dont apologize she said i couldnt
bear that but the next time you want
a-a blind so you can work on kips girl
friend-

  his jaw dropped julia are you mad
at me

  who else she demanded

  why kip of course i thought-
kip she cried what does he mat-
ter i thought you wanted to show me a
good time tonight and instead you leave
me sitting there for three dances
julia the anger boiling up inside
him was changing to bubbles of laughter
he felt a great surging happy release

did you mean it when you said kip
doesnt matter

  of course i meant it

  pardon me he said and turned on
his heel he hurried back to the table
they had left babs looked up with bright
interest on her face kip got slowly to
his feet

  theres something ive been wanting
to do for a long time paul said he felt
light-headed almost tight except that he
hadnt had that much champagne he
took off his glasses and laid them care-
fully on the white tablecloth beside babs
evening bag then he doubled up his fist
and swung on kip

  it was a good clean blow and it
stretched kip saunders out babs
screamed men at nearby tables jumped
to their feet waiters hurried forward

  the next few seconds were confused
and blurred he found himself being
hurried outside julia appeared beside
him and he heard her ask the doorman
to get them a taxi he couldnt see her
very well she was a movement of blue
above which her face was a blurred white
patch he realized then he had left his
glasses inside

  but julia wouldnt let him go back for
them the doorman was at his other
elbow

  darling she said her voice sound-
ing choky you were wonderful

  he took her in his arms and with his
face very close to hers looked down at
her i can see you better this way he
murmured why havent you called me
darling before

  she said i-i hinted about rings-i
even made you kiss me tonight i couldnt
do any more i was afraid you didnt
want me because im not beautiful any
more-

  not photogenic he corrected ner
ive never wanted to marry a model
marry she sighed happily what
a lovely word

  cant you think of some nicer ones
  she shook her head suddenly shy

  i can he said he drew her closer
and just before his lips found hers he mur-
mured julia my wife- and he knew
that more than anything else in the world
he wanted to make them come true

the end
    lememlering

the chilly fingers of the snow
are cradling the arid grass

and leafless branches whip across
the face of icy winds that pass

yet here we knew the honeyed air
of roses spilling into bloom

i close my eyes remembering

and breathe again the sweet perfume

the days drag on more slowly now
while you are held so far away

yet hours with you are no more lost
than are the flowers of yesterday

i close my eyes remembering

and wonder that we are apart

for though you are not here my dear

i see you clearly with my heart

             -by harriet a brad field

zjhe	ljoii

i miss you more than words can tell

and yet i find it true

my days are made so very sweet

by just the thought of you

the tender words you used to speak

the way you smiled at me

your touch your glance your manly step-
so dear each memory

oh these and all the little things
that you were wont to do
remain to bless and comfort me-

in just the thought of you

picture to yourself a girl of twen-
ty-two who lived alone in a tiny
impeccably-kept apartment with a
pair of love birds and a bowl of goldfish
a girl who wore medium heels and neat
print dresses with white collars whose
name was peggy jones who worked in
the literature and philosophy room of
the los angeles public library well
youre wrong peggy jones didnt look
anything like that even though her job
sounded very prosaic she was gay mod-
ern and almost lovely looking

  she wore her warm brown hair in a
softly curled victory bob and bill calvert
said her lips reminded him of a ripe red
persimmon just before you bit into it
she said she hoped hed remember that
her lips werent a persimmon-besides
persimmons were orange not red-be-
cause she was pretty crazy about the way
he kissed her but she certainly had no
intentions of being maimed in the process
he said when he kissed her he couldnt
be held responsible for sudden develop-
ments

  anyway peggy jones was entirely too
happy this dull rainy february afternoon
on her way back to her department after
a biltmore luncheon date with bill she
knew she was too happy there was
something dangerous about this kind of
happiness

  everything became too clear and sweet
and sharp her heart seemed to put out
shining feelers that attached to the whole
world and when they vibrated part of the
sensation was bliss but part was also
pain mildly funny things became hilari-
ous and sad things were almost too sad

to be endured tears started easily to her
eyes and a humming to her lips

  perhaps that was why she paused when
she saw the soldier there was something
sort of pathetic about a lone private any-
way but let him be tall and loosely knit
with sun-burned hair and shy eyes-the
kind of a soldier who wouldnt even be
able to wear a majors uniform without
looking like hed gotten dressed in a wind
tunnel-and then let him stand in the cen-
ter of a huge quiet place like the high-
domed rotunda of the library staring
upward with an expression of rapt won-
der on his lean serious young face the
sight of him drew peggy to a sudden halt
because of a sudden twitch at those over-
ly-sensitive heartstrings

  talk about green she thought it was
a wonder the cows hadnt eaten him for
grass long ago

  she went up to him heh she said
softly i think you ought to know that
the city owns this building just in case
somebody tries to sell it to you

  his eyes dropped but for a moment
they were still so clouded with wonder
she doubted if he even saw her then
suddenly his lean face flushed a painful
beet-red and she was afraid he was going
to bolt like an overgrown colt confronted
by a wild tumbleweed

  good heavens she thought again the
original corn right off the cob she was
amused but it was the kindly variety and
it must have registered in her expression
because he didnt bolt after all

  he jerked his big thumb upward and
said hesitantly arent those what you
call murals

if peggy was trilling to accept bills idea that love teas a gay
m bit of ribbon to wear in your hair why was she disturbed by

 private daniel webster whitneys ideal of love being a
precious thing men fought to preserve


she looked up at the bewildered
young soldier part of her
wanted to laugh at his expression
and part of her wanted to start
a wild storm of sobbing


new love magazine

  peggy nodded a warm smile curving
her persimmon lips do you like them 
gosh i he breathed

  youve never seen any before

  no maam and i never knew there
were so many books in the world before
either theyve got a different room here
for each kind too-like history and re-
ligion and science big rooms again
that look of rapt astonishment crossed his
face i just never did realize there were
so many books for people to read and
free too

  do you like to read

  oh yes maam i sure do only i
never had much chance to read anything
outside of school books just a little
shakespeare and dickens and then the
bible of course

  of course agreed peggy softly and
quite ridiculously her eyes were full of
tears but thats what happened when
you were so happy a hayseed of a
young soldier could make you cry by tell-
ing you he read shakespeare and dickens
and the bible

  she said where are you from sol-
dier

  north dakota

  a farm

  the beet-red stained his lean cheeks
again but put his big hands behind him
as if he suddenly realized just how big
they really were i guess you can tell
that all right he said with embarrass-
ment

  i was born on a farm myself peggy
announced staunchly only we called it
a ranch anything bigger than a pansy
bed is a ranch in california whats
your name

  dan whitney daniel webster whit-
ney

  she managed to keep the smile off her
lips this time but it really wouldnt have
hurt him because it was a very tender
smile she said mine is peggy jones
i work here in the literature and phil-
osophy room downstairs thats where
we keep all the shakespeare and dickens
if youd like to you can come along and
browse around ill help you find any-
thing you want

  well thanks maam- he said i
mean miss jones id sure like to do
that

  lets go then

  but i cant now im supposed to
meet my buddy hes from brooklyn
were going out to hollywood and look
for some movie stars

  peggy laughed im afraid theyre a
lot harder to find than that besides its
pouring outside

  his expression said he couldnt possi-
bly understand what difference that would
make rain never hurt anyone he
said i always used to go tramping in
the rain back home he added with
clear-cut homesickness only the rain
in california is different somehow it
doesnt sting your face like a good hard
northern storm and theres no thunder or
lightning with it and everything is green
already so spring doesnt show much
he paused i always liked spring bet-
ter than any other season
unaccountably peggy heard herself
protest earnestly but you can still feel
spring here in california inside you
i mean just like anywhere

  for a moment his eyes went straight
into hers and she discovered they werent
quite as shy as she had thought yes
miss jones you sure can there was
something different about his voice too
and then he said hurriedly but ive
got to go now and i sure thank you
for talking to me

  it was a pleasure dan a real pleas-
ure she smiled up at him good-bye
now

   bye he mumbled

  she stood and watched him until he
was out of sight she was so wonder-
fully terribly in love with bill-she had
so much love inside of her that she could
even let some of it overflow toward this
shy young soldier from north dakota

  she wondered if he would come back
it would be fun helping him find some-
thing else to read besides dickens and
shakespeare she bet hed like jack lon-
don and conrad and maybe even heming-
way he was naive but he was no fool
she could tell that by his eyes and
the structure of his face was good daniel
webster whitney  she smiled mus-
ingly somehow it made a person feel
a lot better about the war just knowing
dans kind was in there pitching and
then abruptly her thoughts shifted to bill
please dial l-o-v-e



again and there was no room for any
others

the next time she saw dan whitney
over a month had passed it was on
a monday evening less than an hour be-
fore closing time she looked up from
her check desk at the door of the litera-
ture and philosophy room but for a
moment nothing registered not that
dan had changed but lately peggy was
apt to stare at her best friends and then
pass them right by

  gosh he exclaimed happily hel-

lo	miss jones i was scared maybe you
might not be here

  hello she said briefly

  some high school girls came through
with their arms loaded and peggy stamped
out their books she could feel dans
eyes on her pale set face she hadnt
bothered about crutch lipstick and there
were bad circles under her eyes

  when they were alone again he leaned
against the desk and asked in a low wor-
ried voice have you been sick since i
saw vou

  no

  well you dont look so good miss
jones

  dont i

  he stepped aside and let her stamp
out some more books and then he said
is anvthing wrong

  nothing much

  oh god nothing much just that if
bill doesnt call me and tell me he didnt
mean what he said i cant stand it any
longer cant    cant    cant   

  she realized she was digging more deep
meaningless doodles on a pad of paper
with a sharply pointed pencil held in fin-
gers that were cold and trembling she
threw down the pencil and looked up at
the bewildered young soldier

  part of her wanted to laugh at his ex-
pression and part of her wanted to start
a wild storm of sobbing she hadnt
cried once since that night a week ago
with bill not once she had just waited
but now unless this galoot took his lean
north dakota face away from her desk
she was liable to do anything

  she said im sorry but you cant
stand here youll find the shakespeare
over there and the dickens there if you

want anything else youll have to look in
the files you know- a b c for the
authors name

  she wanted to hurt him and she suc-
ceeded she wanted to hurt anything that
came near her that kept her mind off bill
and that phone call that must come-that
had to come there was a limit to how
much anyone could stand pride had
kept her from phoning him but even pride
can crumple under sustained pressure

  dan didnt move away however he
said when the library closes does that
mean youre through work too

  yes but im going straight home if
youre thinking of asking me for a date
will you let me see vou home then
no

  well can i walk you to the car or the
bus or whatever takes you home

  she began to rub her fingers across her
forehead back and forth slowly she had
a dreadful headache and her eyes felt dry
and hot she glanced up at the clock and
shrugged wearily if you want to she
said in a toneless voice ill be at the
fifth street entrance about nine fifteen
but if youre not there i wont wait

  ill be there dan said quietly

  now and then peggy glanced in his
direction as he wandered slowly around
the shelves taking down an occasional
book handling them all with an almost
reverent gentleness he finally carried
a big hefty volume to one of the rear ta-
bles and began to read

  when the closing bell rang he filed out
with all the rest of the late customers
catching her eyes for just a second very
plainly begging for a look of added con-
firmation that she would meet him out-
side

  peggy nodded curtly and continued to
stamp out books when she finally
stepped out into the damp foggy night
he came up to her and took her arm

  they walked downhill on fifth street
toward broadway the neon-brightness
of the downtown streets had disappeared
in the strict dimout there were no more
window shoppers people walked quick-
ly and apparently with purpose or stayed
indoors the old traffic jams were a
memory now it was mostly busses and
street cars and taxis but the darkened
theater marquees still drew in plenty of


new love magazine

late movie-goers and the bars were over-
flowing and peggy noticed there were
still plenty of couples going places arm in
arm as she and dan walked-only it
should have been bill

  she stiffened and dan stepped a little
away from her he hadnt spoken since
they left the library and neither had she
they were passing the darkness of per-
shing square when she heard him say
my pa used to say that a persons vict-
uals and troubles always set better for
being well chewed he meant it was good
to talk about things sometimes-out
loud

  your pa sounds like a very helpful
man

  dont you want to tell me about it
miss jones

  i dont-think so

  i wish you would

  peggy bit her tongue to keep from giv-
ing him another sharp reply it was only
that if she had to hurt inside like this
someone else ought to share it with her
she answered him in a stiff constrained
little voice its a very trite story very
uninteresting it happens all the time
only not to me she thought wildly
and i dont know how to handle it i
dont know what to do to make it stop
tearing me apart like this

  a fellow dan suggested

  her lips twisted sharply in the dark-
ness like a spasm of pain a very at-
tractive fellow she said the kind who
does everything better and smoother than
any other fellow you ever met she could
have added the kind you think youll die
if you cant get and then if you do get
hint you know youll die if you ever lose
him

  she dug her hands deep into the pock-
ets of her trench-coat and threw back her
head trying to draw the damp foggy air
into a breast that felt bruised there
was an almost physical taste of bitterness
on her lips

  go on dan said gently go on and
talk about him miss jones itll do you
good dont mind about me just pre-
tend im not here-or pretend you wont
ever see me again anyway im only a
stranger

  hes an assistant cameraman at one
of the movie studios she said and

  then suddenly the words began to come
easily she talked fast and tonelessly
more to herself than dan she wanted to
hear how it sounded aloud for so many
endless hours she had gone over it si-
lently a treadmill of thoughts around
and around   

  we were to be married next month
that is i thought we were i guess it was
never much more than an idea with him
he tried to explain last week how he felt
he was perfectly frank about it he said
all of a sudden there was something about
me that sort of suffocated him he said
no man wants to be smothered to death
in a womans love he said i should re-
lax when he kisses me i should act like
veronica lake-dead pan he said he
wasnt breaking anything off he was just
taking himself a little breather he said
hed phone me any night soon id hear
from him again

  she put her hand to her throat and
swallowed the cords felt stiff they
began to ache intollerably she swallowed
again but she didnt make a sound

  they had reached the bus stop and her
bus was just pulling around the corner of
the square she said and so you see
why ive got to stay around home at
night i couldnt possibly go anywhere
she glanced up at dan and something in
his eyes made her suddenly reach out
and clutch his sleeve dan she whis-
pered pleadingly oh dan he will phone
me wont he  he promised he said he
wasnt breaking us up if hell only give
me another chance i wont smother him
any more i can pretend i dont love him
so much i can- she broke off and
began to bite at her lower lip conscious
of what a spectacle she was making of
herself talking this way to an utter
stranger pleading with him for a crumb
of hope

  she turned aw-ay stiff and hot with
shame and stared blindly across the
street the bus pulled up before them

  i-im sorry she mumbled but you
asked me to talk about it

he pressed her cold fingers good
night miss jones and dont you worry
-liell phone you all right but i think
ill just stop around tomorrow night
about the same time he added quickly
oh not to take you anywhere just to
please dial l-o-v-e



walk you over to the bus again

  she started to protest but there wasnt
time with another weary shrug she
climbed aboard good night dan

  daniel webster whitney smiled up at
her his eyes were warm and under-
standing and the shyness was gone out
of them

dan was true to his word he showed
up at the library about the same time
the next evening read until closing time
and then took her to the bus stop only
this time the whole atmosphere was dif-
ferent it was almost friendly again
quieter easier there was no mention of
bill and peggy realized it had helped a
little to talk about him to someone the
fear and the pain were still there but she
could camouflage them well enough to
discuss books with dan and make a show
of interest in what he said

  when it became really bad was after
the door of her tiny apartment closed be-
hind her and she was alone with that tele-
phone-when the waiting lay ahead of
her    second after minute after hour
of it knozving that bill must call because
he had promised

  standing with her back against the
door she suddenly remembered that aft-
ernoon when she had first seen dan
standing in the library rotunda but was
it possible anyone could really have been
as happy as that she tried to recapture
the feel of that happiness but it would
have been easier to recall the feel of a
blazing summer sun on a winter mid-
night

  her emptiness and fear and loneliness
were like evil forces that swept through
the bright neat little rooms chilling them
making the colors cold and the sound of
her own movements hollow in her ears a
black depression seemed to creep out of
the walls and pile up around her she
stood looking at the telephone she had
waited so long and hard for its ring she
wondered if she might not scream when
its shrill sound finally broke the echoing
silence

  im a fool she thought desperately
worse than a fool girls dont act like
this nowadays they dont let anything-
not even love-throw them off strides
relax bill had suggested take it all

  with a shrug pretend love is a gay bit of
ribbon to be worn in your hair not a
chain to bind and crush the heart right
out of you

  well they were just words too-
thoughts without any emotional reaction
   like happiness maybe every girl
in the world wasnt the same maybe
some of them just couldnt relax maybe
to some of them love was still a fright-
eningly intense and magical thing a thing
of flame-red witchery and torment and
passion with all the ancient powers it
had possessed in the days of juliet and
heloise and isolde

  it was the fear of that black icy de-
pression crushing down on her the min-
ute she was alone which kept her from
protesting when dan got on the bus with
her wednesday night it kept her from
protesting when he got off with her and
walked as far as her apartment house en-
trance

  he said hesitantly i dont suppose
youd feel like asking me in

  well i-

  its all right he interrupted quickly
i know how you feel but it doesnt
ever hurt a fellow to ask

  dan youre very kind and wonder-
fully understanding

  he made a deprecatory gesture

  but you are she insisted and i
just thought of something else too how
is it that you can meet me every night
how do you manage to get back to
camp she shook her head apologetical-
ly isnt it awful to be so full of your
own importance ive never even asked
you where you were stationed

  at camp roberts but im on fur-
lough now i had a week coming to me
and i thought id better try and get it
because i dont think ill be around much
longer my buddys gone already

  but   she frowned why didnt you
go back home and visit your folks

  i only had a week i couldnt have af-
forded to go by plane and the trains arent
so sure anymore id only have had may-
be a day or so with them and- he broke
off and slowly scratched his lean cheek
his eyes dropped away from hers i
guess i just wanted to stay here worse
but you-you havent any friends
here have you


new love magazine

  he shook his head

  where are you staying dan

  at a little hotel downtown

  he told her the name of it and she said
why thats only a block from the li-
brary

  i know he admitted awkwardly
what do you usually do after you
leave me in the evenings

  the entrance way wasnt so dark that
she couldnt see the beet-red stain mount-
ing out of his collar read he said

  a tender aching little smile curved her
lips dickens

  shakespeare he grinned ive got
a pocket volume

  no movies no bars or nightclubs at
all  hollywood and la have some very
famous places dan wouldnt you like
to see them

  ill say i would gosh but its not
much fun going places like that alone
she said gently im sure you could
find some nice girl at the uso or one
of the service clubs whod be glad to go
with you

  i guess id rather read he said
briefly

  dan whitney youre not using a
subtle form of strategy on me by any
chance

  no he answered earnestly im not
but you asked me

  so i did pain contracted her heart
and she added unsteadily but i havent
had that phone call yet dan and i-
ive got to get it when it comes i cant
go out with you i just cant dan

  he replied firmly i didnt ask you
to miss jones i only asked if i could
come in awhile that way i wouldnt
have to read shakespeare every night all
by myself and you wouldnt lose out on
your phone call he paused ive only
got tonight and three more ive got to
be back at camp sunday

  she searched his lonely serious young
face you really would be content just
to-to sit around and talk  while i wait
for a call from another man

  i sure would he breathed fervently
she took her eyes out of his and looked
quickly away she was silent she felt
somehow humble and ashamed before
him he didnt have to say anything
more it was just there he wasnt even

offering it to her he was just telling her
that he wanted to wait around with her
while the man she loved got ready to take
her back

  it was strange what different forms love
could take with her it assumed such
intensity and eloquence that bill said she
suffocated him with it and with dan it
assumed an ask-for-nothing hope-for-
nothing silence she wondered if a girl
could suffocate dan by loving him too
much at least hed be a lot kinder about
it than bill

  she said id like to have you come in
awhile dan and you might as well call
me peggy digging around for her key
she added i hope you like apple pie
its about all i have to offer you that
and some cold ham

  gosh he exclaimed and followed her
down a long carpeted hallway and into
the tiny apartment with the two love birds
and the bowl of goldfish he stood at the
door while she went around lighting
lamps the colors in the green-and-amber
chintz and the taupe rug and the apricot
walls came out all bright and warm again
and somehow dans voice and his oc-
casional laugh completely destroyed that
echoing hollowness

that night and the two that followed
were unlike any peggy had ever
known during the entire year that she
had gone around with bill she couldnt
remember one evening passed quietly in
her apartment

  bill wanted his entertainment in a state
of perpetual motion in bars and night-
clubs or parties at his hollywood apart-
ment he made pretty big money at the
studio and he liked to spend it with ap-
propriate sound effects and plenty of
technicolor

  a night like one of these with dan
would have driven him crazv--just lis-
tening to the radio talking or remaining
comfortably silent a game of gin rummy
an argument over hamlet a short story
read aloud and then when it began to
grow late a stand-up snack around the
refrigerator

  dan talked about his folks and the big
north dakota farm where he was born
and raised he told her about the iron-
cold winters when the wind came roaring
please dial l-o-v-e



down from canada when forty below
zero was nothing he described the hot
summers and the wide fields of grain
waving along the four horizons and the
funny little school house and the games
he and his four sisters used to play in
the big barn

  once when he finished telling her about
his mother she thought stunned why
i dont even know if bill has a mother
and once when she asked him to fix a
broken lamp connection after seating
himself on the floor he glanced up and
must have caught a startled expression
on her face because he said quickly
whats wrong peg

  n-nothing she replied unsteadily
only-only dont get a shock

  but it was she who had gotten the
shock because all at once she realized
that these nights were exactly as she had
pictured her married life but that was
before she met bill and knew their life
together would be something entirely dif-
ferent not that married life even with
someone like dan would be so placid
with the war and everything but it was
strangely disturbing to find her old dreams
suddenly alive even for a few short hours

  and once she said abruptly dan-
do you think a girl can offer a man too
much love so that he-he suffocates
he scratched the side of his lean cheek
in that gesture she had come to know so
well well he replied slowly my pa
used to say the finest wheat in the world
wont grow in loose sand and only a fool
would sow it there

  after a strained silence she said in a
tight little voice but suppose theres no
where else to sow it but in the sand
theres always another place he said
if youre not in too big a hurry

  just as dan was leaving friday night
it was peggy who suggested that they
spend his last night going places

  he stared at her

  she said bravely before she could
change her mind if bill phones me he-
hell just have to phone again

  a look of joyful eagerness crossed
dans face and she watched him valiantly
try to deny it with a protest

  as long as i wont know whether bill
called me or not ill pretend he didnt
that way i wont feel any worse than
ive felt for the past two weeks

  he crushed her two hands in his
peg    he exclaimed oh peg  
gosh    he was like an overjoyed
kid with the promise of a circus

  she smiled up at him well go any-
where you say dan anywhere

  the brown derby he said quickly
and the cocoanut grove and that
chinese theater with the stars footprints
in the cement i even read about those
places up in north dakota

  searching his happy face she said
ive been awfully selfish dan ive let
you spend your whole furlough just wait-
ing around with me-for a phone call i
should have made you go out and have a
good time

  i wouldnt have gone unless youd
come too

  but youve wanted to go youve
wanted to go very badly havent you
dan

  his expression grew deeply sober no
i havent he said not without you
oh dan   she whispered dan
my dear  and before she realized she
had put both hands on his shoulders and
reached up and kissed him on the lips
gratefully tenderly lightly

  it was only when she saw his cheeks
turn pale and hard his eyes narrow with
pain that she stopped to think what a
cruel thing she had done

  she spoke quickly to cover their con-
fusion ill have to come home first to-
morrow night and dress so youd better
pick me up here i think i can get off
earlv so lets say about nine

  you really want to go he asked
youre not just doing this out of-
i really want to go she interrupted
firmly and was a little astonished that
she had spoken with complete honesty
with you dan

  his face was all bright again nine
oclock then

  nine oclock she promised good-
night dan

   night peg

when she opened her door on satur-
day night the telephone was ring-
ing

  she stared at it in unbelief and then
gave a tiny sob she ran and put both
hands around it and brought it up to her
trembling lips and hungry ears

  hello baby remember me that
warm husky voice of his went through
her in a twisting thrill of sweetness and
agony

  bill   she breathed oh bill 
  doing anything

  no her fingers tightened convul-
sively around the handle no

  im at the seven seas in hollywood
-with the gang count and amy and
barry and sybil and nancy how about
joining us

  do you-want me bill

  do you think id have phoned you if
i hadnt he laughed and it was so
much more wonderful than all her mem-
ories of his laugh that she caught her
breath but if you want to be coaxed ill
coax or better still ill save it till you
get here and prove it another way how
about it miss books

  that was his old extra-affectionate pet
name for her she swallowed hard at the
lump of breathlessness in her throat she
felt tingling glowing stars were in front
of her eyes and bliss in her heart i-ill
be there in about forty minutes darling
swell and by the way-the girls are
all in spangles

  she managed to get the phone back in
its cradle and then she remembered dan
but it was too late to remember dan it
would have been too late anyway dan
would have to understand

  if bill had phoned while they were
gone she would not have known what
a person doesnt know cant hurt her
but what a person does know can be sheer
heaven or hell and she knew the
sound of bills voice was all warm and
alive for her again and she knew he
wanted her with him dan wouldnt even
suggest she give up that heaven after
all it was only a last night of furlough
a good-bye between friends against-
against bill and the coming to life again
of her very existence dan wouldnt ask
such a sacrifice dan wouldnt even ac-
cept it if she had the strength of will to

give it to him-which she hadnt
 she wrote him a note

  dear dan

    bill just phoned im meeting him dan
  im terribly sorry about tonight for us but
  im terribly glad he phoned that sounds
  crazy doesnt it but its true and i think
  youll understand youve been so fine and
  kind to me it doesnt seem right to treat you
  like this but dan-oh dan maybe the less
   write the better itll be

    good-byet and the best of luck if you
  ever feel like writing to me ill be very
  proud and happy and i promise to answer

                                      peg

  just the way i promised to go out with
him tonight she thought but then that
hot eagerness trembled through her again
and even shame was forgotten she fast-
ened the note just above the doorbell with
a thumbtack

  at exactly nine fifteen she stepped into
the dim perfumed exotic south sea at-
mosphere of the seven seas she was
wearing the red and gold evening dress
that bill preferred no one would have
suspected she was a librarian her brown
hair was brushed about her erectly held
head in a warm shining halo except
for being much too pale she looked poised
and utterly lovely

  and there was bill he had her hands
in his and the thrill of his touch leaped
through her flame-like she had never
known another man quite so attractive
quite so casually smooth in all the world
there was only one bill

  well well he smiled hello miss
books

  he drew her toward the bar well
have a couple alone first before we join
the others

  the imitation rain began pounding on
the roof or was that the sound of her
own heartbeats and then strangely ab-
ruptly shockingly there was neither the
sound of rain nor any turmoil within her
she was staring at bill her brows pinched
into a tiny frown very attractive and
very smooth very superficial

  he said ive missed you sweet
  have you

  i began to get jumpy

  you did

  say whats the matter with you any-
way why the dead pan

  thats the way you wanted it played
please dial l-o-v-e



  well a little of a good thing goes a
long way he drew her arm against him
i said i missed you sweetheart he
whispered now you say something
and i missed you she said quietly
i missed you so hideously i thought i
was going to lose my mind for awhile
attababy and ill tell you something
else from now on ill take all the
smothering you want to give-

  but i wont ever miss you again she
said isnt that funny bill i had to
see you to realize that

  his face hardened anger touched his
eyes are you a little drunk already
no cold sober more sober than ive
ever been around you in my life what
dan said was true-only a fool would try
to sow good wheat in loose sand

  now i know youre drunk and who
the hell is dan

 a farmer from north dakota who
reads dickens and shakespeare and-
whats he to you

 i dont know yet everything i
hope

the

  peggy- come back here

  but she was gone

  at exactly ten-thirty she flew into the
  lobby of the little hotel near the library

  mr daniel webster whitney she
  told the clerk her face was radiant
  and please    please may i go up to
  his room just for a few minutes i want
  it to be a surprise so please dont ring
  him its quite all right you see im
  going to marry him-i think

  she knocked on the door of room 
  it opened and she looked up into a lean
  startled young face

  the face blurred and she blinked away
  her tears hello she said in a choked-
  up little voice busy

  nope just reading

  shakespeare

  the bible

  weve got a date havent we
  have we

  oh dan  she sobbed oh danny
  danny   

  for a north dakota farmer he kissed

because she held mark responsi-
ble for phils death a marriage to
the man she hated seemed crys-
tals only compensation for the
love she thought shed lost

eman

by kathryn
keeley

crystal waited in the office of
the jansen munitions plant pipss
small hand tightly clutched in hers
her small son was just three he had
her topaz eyes the same tawny curls but
his ingratiating smile belonged to his
father crystal shut her eyes tight against
the tears that stung at her lids every time
she looked at him for pipss father had
been killed in a tragic automobile acci-
dent six months ago

  through the plate glass partitions she
could feel the curious stares of the clerks
and stenographers speculating on her
visit to mark jansen the man she had so
bitterly blamed for phillips death

  the ordeal confronting her was terrify-
ing she kept swallowing the rising lump
in her throat so her voice would be cool
when she made her demands she didnt
look like a desperate young mother rather
she was small and gentle but despair wid-
ened her eyes until they were too big for
the delicate oval of her face the trans-
lucence of her skin was accented by the
severe black suit but the usual soft red
of her mouth was a thin line

  hi young fellow  marks deep voice
shattered the quiet he swung pips to his
shoulder and the little boy let out a de-
lighted squeal it annoyed crystal because
she wanted to keep the meeting as formal
as possible her hands were cold and
moist with panic as she nervously twisted


the narrow delicately styled gold wedding
band

  mark said its nice of you to drop in
crystal youre looking well

  the sense of his words rose to over-
whelm her it was obvious he thought she
had come in friendship at last after re-
pelling his overtures for so many weeks

  she said unsteadily i have something
to discuss with you

  mark carried pips to his desk and put
a fascinating paper weight in his chubby
hands a glass ball which sent a shower
of snow over a miniature snowman

  with the broad expanse of mahogany
between crystal had the sudden forlorn
feeling of being left out in an alien world
if it were not for this insurmountable bar-
rier between them she might have liked
mark jansen he had a big brown hulk
of a body topped with bronze hair bronze
lashes shaded his hilarious blue eyes
laughter had a way of coming down over
his face crinkling his eyes before it
reached his mouth it was a grave mouth
almost stern denying the boyishness of
his features she realized now he had be-
come a bit grim since the accident so
he should

  mark was saying pips has grown un-
believably in six months

  it brought her back to her problem
thats what i wanted to see you about
perhaps you didnt know that philip car-
ried no insurance

  he gave a startled gasp of protest

  she hastened to defend her dead hus-
band he was improvident i realized
there was assurance in the other girls laugh-
ter her gay bantering voice called up
mark people in this town go to city hall
for two things-to get married or to go to
jail which is it


new love magazine

that but philip was so busy living in
the present he didnt think of the future
there were many bills and it has eaten
up my small reserve

  the deep blue of his eyes caught and
held hers i didnt know he said slow-
ly i had supposed phil was well fixed

  her half smile was bitter he had
been draining the principal his mother
had been using it before him to give him
the things he should never have had the
right fraternity at college a car an ex-
travagant allowance his mother spoiled
him im not blaming her exactly but i
dont want to make the same mistake with
pips philip was all she had after his
father died they travelled constantly
philip never learned to settle down even
after we were married

tter voice shook remembering that
whirlwind courtship-her bewild-
ered acceptance of the lavish gifts philip
bestowed on her she was seventeen and
his car had broken down in the little new
england town where she lived it was a
custom-built model and considerable time
was required for the parts to reach her
fathers garage where it was being re-
paired

  she had dashed in one day when philip
was impatiently fretting at the delay his
exasperation ebbed at the very sight of
her laughing delicate face her bright
wind-tossed hair crystal was fascinated
by philips jovial high spirits she had
never known anyone quite like him he
talked of far places with charming inti-
macy compared to the sober-faced
struggling high school boys whom she
occasionally dated he was a cyclone of
gaiety crystal was the luckiest girl that
he was even interested

  to her parents dismay they were
married a week later in the white-spired
church

  days after she discovered philips high
spirits came from a bottle that he was
incapable of determining when he had
enough the bright sheen of their love
had been obscured by her constant watch-
fulness and his resulting irritation she
had banked heavily on the arrival of her
baby philip would settle down then but
approaching fatherhood failed to awaken
his responsibilities

  crystal had gone alone to the hospital
pips was born and nearly died she didnt
know where to find philip the despera-
tion of fighting such an intangible foe
nearly unseated her reason she grew
thin and haggard a despairing replica of
the seventeen-year old bride thats when
her father had taken matters into his
hands and insisted that she leave her hus-
band the shock of losing her jolted
philip to earth

  she suddered remembering his hysteri-
cal pleading her heart flooded with
warmth and forgiveness philip did love
her she would help him fight this dis-
ease

  again her father took matters out of
her hands she could remain with philip
only if he entered an institution and re-
ceived medical care to her utter amaze-
ment philip agreed he was willing to go
to any extremes to keep his wife and child
her father even accompanied him to a
reliable hospital but his shaggy knit brows
testified his doubt that philip would be
strong enough to rehabilitate himself her
father did not live long enough to learn
the result of his ultimatum the excite-
ment and worry brought on a heart attack
which proved fatal

  no one ever knew of that year in the
hospital the exultation crystal felt when
philip progressed no one ever suspected
that he bribed an orderly or a truck driver
to bring him liquor no one even guessed
certainly not mark jansen

  the one redeeming feature was that
philip was cured in time he returned
home when the jansen munitions plant
were erecting one-story galvanized build-
ings on the outskirts of the town he
was his lovable self proud of his young
son deeply in love with his devoted wife

  mark jansen was a college classmate
he was their house-guest until the plant
was organized crystal liked and admired
the tall rugged executive-until the night
mark drove his car over the steep em-
bankment killing her husband who was
riding with him

  it was an unavoidable accident the
sheriff assured her of that but she never
believed him if mark had been anyone
less important than the president of the
jansen munitions plant he would have
gone to prison for manslaughter
marriage on demand



mark was saying his eyes gentle if
there is anything i can do-

  she choked there is plenty you can
do

  would you be interested in a position
in the office

  the smile she gave him wasnt pretty
coming from crystal she asked sweetly
what would i do with pips

  mark tousled pipss curly gold hair
isnt there someone a friend to look
after him

no there isnt she retorted crisply
out of a short silence he suggested
tentatively i dont want to embarrass
you but if it is a question of money i
could lend you sufficient to tide you over
it is more than money

  he was fast losing patience with her
and she was glad every righteous im-
pulse rebelled against bandying polite
words with sotneone who had carelessly
rocked her world from its base the hot
surging emotion that was pulsing through
her veins was hate how could he sit
there so suave and assured while she and
pips suffered why should he escape
punishment for his crime

  mark hunched his swivel chair forward
a perplexed frown on his forehead he
said with a touch of grimness if you will
he frank crystal ill do my best to help
you what do you have in mind

  she drew a long steadying breath
marriage

  he gasped or maybe she just imagined
it to whom may i ask

  you

  it hit him right between the eyes and
she had the satisfaction of knowing she
had staggered him it held no triumph
the problem she was facing was too
titanic to be lessened by anything mark
jansen might think

  he couldnt speak for a minute

  she said coldly im not crazy i have
given it days of serious thought pips
needs a father someone with a firm
guiding hand i couldnt possibly take a
position and leave pips to a careless ser-
vant or an indifferent friend he is too
precious to me too little to be left alone
crystal choked back the hoarseness of
her throat

  mark found his voice fi can under-
stand that of course i can make a gen-

erous settlement  you to enable you
to raise him comfortably but marriage
crystal you are bound to meet someone
in a year or two with whom you will fall
in love

  her lip curled in faint scorn i loved
philip and i could not love again

  he ran a bewildered hand through his
crisp bronze hair marriage it isnt
fair-

  hot resentment flayed her she could
feel the blood in her cheeks her eyelids
felt as if they were pinned back not
fair to you how can you say that you
were responsible for philips death just
as surely as if you had pulled the trigger
of a gun the accident was hushed up
because of your name but you know and i
know you are no better than a murderer
you are hysterical

  she covered her trembling with defi-
ance i was never more sane in my life
it isnt that i want anything for myself
pips is the only one who matters you
are responsible for the loss of his father
and i demand a new father for him
suppose i refuse mark asked softly
you wont if you have an ounce of
honor i believe the jansens pride them-
selves on their honor

  for an instance his blue eyes blazed at
her it was as if she were looking into
a stormy sea for an incredible heartbeat
crystal was afraid of this stranger to
whom she was making such a strange
proposal but she quickly brushed her
apprehension aside by every code she
was justified the law said a life for a life
she was demanding a father for pips by
the same right

  mark chucked the little boy under his
dimpled chin maybe you are worth
wrecking two lives for

  crystal rose  dont forget you wrecked
philips she reminded him her legs
were wfeak she felt like a silken thread
worn to the breaking point she knew she
couldnt stand much more her purse con-
tained two dimes and some pennies if
mark refused in her present mental state
she might do something ghastly

  she looked at pips swinging his fat legs
against the desk love and despair were
there in her eyes for mark to read her
trembling hands spoke of endurance dan-
gerously near the cracking point the


new love magazine

color had faded from her cheeks she was
so white mark walked around the desk

  ill make the necessary arrangements
for the wedding he said quietly

  crystal swayed a little she knew his
firm arm was supporting her and his anx-
ious gaze was on her face when did
you eat last there was deep concern in
his voice

  not so long ago she lied faintly

  pips injected honestly mummy didnt
eat

  well pips well eat now by the way
im going to be your new daddy

  pips thought that over he said are
you going to kiss mummy 

  crystal straightened she stammered
very low please mark

mark paid no attention to her protest
of course im going to kiss mummy

  matter-of-factly his lips brushed her
cold cheek

  unexpectedly her resentment flared
against him it was like him to take ad-
vantage of her as if reading her thoughts
his eyebrows arched mockingly dont
worry this is simply a business deal
staged for pips sake i havent the slight-
est intention of touching you any more
than necessary i imagine i can recognize
hate when i see it staring at me and
believe me the emotion i feel at this hold-
up isnt exactly love or anything near it

tthat sardonic promise alone sustained
her through the nourishing luncheon
at a quiet restaurant she and mark spoke
hardly at all although pips chattered in-
cessantly filling the breach between them

  once mark left them with the trans-
parent excuse of a telephone call and
crystal had the anxious thought that he
had reconsidered and was walking out it
didnt matter now nothing mattered
she had the detached feeling as if she were
viewing a rather poor play from a gallery
seat the words were muffled and she
couldnt keep her mind on the action
somehow it would come out right in the
end

  when mark returned he carried a cor-
sage of tiny pink rosebuds crystals hands
were so cold she could hardly hold them

  he said mockingly id like pips to
remember something pretty about this
wedding

  in the same dispassionate vein she re-
torted thanks they are lovely she
would not wear them to her marriage she
determined with disdain there was noth-
ing pretty about this wedding nothing
sacred the sweetness of the flowers was
simply a taunt

  but when the three of them reached city
hall the flowers were still on her shoul-
der their fragrance making her a little
giddy

  mark secured the license with a mini-
mum of delay although a long queque
shuffled by the window the waiting
period was also mysteriously waived
again crystal was reminded of the in-
fluence of the jansen name the same
sheriff who so conveniently listed philips
tragedy as an unavoidable accident per-
formed the ceremony

  mark produced a diamond band he
must have secured it when he bought the
flowers in a panic she wondered what she
should do with philips ring it had never
been off her finger at the proper time
however mark simply slipped his glitter-
ing band on her third finger it was so
large it covered philips ring and that
wasnt right either

  it was when they were coming down the
wide stone steps of the municipal build-
ing that someone hailed mark and then
crystal saw the tall girl with black hair
and slanting dark eyes exquisitely dressed
in a mink coat her laughter held all the
assurance of security

  her gay bantering voice called up
mark people m this town go to city
hall for two things-to get married or
go to jail which is it

  a dull guilty red spread over his cheeks
his eyes were blades of cold steel crystal
knew in a brief vivid flash this girl meant
something to him there was a possessive
audacity in the way she laughed up at him

  crystals hands were ice and her heart
stopped beating waiting for his answer

  it came at last hopelessly slow crys-
tal and i have just been married toni
he made the introductions in an expres-
sionless tone toni was too stunned to
say a word

  it was not until crystal and pips were
installed in marks suite at the towns
leading apartment hotel that she was over-
come by the enormity of the step she had
marriage on demand



just taken with such great haste

  mark made sure that they were both
comfortably settled then said i must
go out for a while

  to toni crystal supplied the words
silently her lips twisted in scorn he
would have to give toni some explanation
of this sudden marriage so far as crys-
tal was concerned he could devote the
rest of his life to toni provided he was
a father to pips

  on his way out mark had dinner sent
up crystal and pips ate in quiet absorp-
tion the food tasted like ashes pips was
fascinated by his new surroundings by the
stuffed dog that had arrived with the din-
ner crystal had difficulty getting him
settled in the big bed in the guest room
mark had pushed it up against the wall
so pips wouldnt roll out

  when he was asleep at last the reaction
set in she crawled in beside him and
cried noiselessly hard racking sobs that
tore at her heart she wished this reckless
dy undone the urgency that prompted
her to take the lives of four people into her
hands seemed unimportant she and pips
could have managed somehow

  it was daybreak when she dropped off
to sleep mark hadnt returned in the
morning she found his bed hadnt been
disturbed

the next lew weeks dragged by in
numbed monotony whatever marks
social obligations were he was always
there for dinner his conversation with
crystal was brief and remote he was
real only when he played with pips then
his eyes would go so blue the tears would
sting at crystals eyelids his laughter
would hold a deep heart-breaking note
with a frightened dismay crystal real-
ized pips was his vulnerable spot it was
a two-edged sword that pips returned his
love he would leave her at the drop of
a hat at the sound of marks footsteps

  at noon one day mark brought home
a sad-eyed black spaniel for pips the
playful little puppy frisked about pips
short legs tumbling him to the floor and
licking his face mark went into gales of
laughter with him for an unbelievable
half hour the polite barrier between them
crumpled

  i always wanted a mut when i was a

kid he explained to crystal and my
mother wouldnt have one because of hairs
on the furniture and the fleas in the rugs
every puppy i coaxed home the spca
got eventually

  hope stirred in her heart mark was
talking to her as if she were a human
being rather than some horrible creature
who had forced herself into his life
every boy should have a dog she said
softly

  we never had a house either my fa-
ther travelled and we lived at a hotel
all hotel rooms look alike i have no
memories of a place that was our own
poor mark she breathed trying to
picture a small boy with crisp bronze hair
and troubled blue eyes he must have been
a very lonely little boy

  when i grew up i managed to get
some of the things i wanted

  with a sickening flash she knew it didnt
include a wife another mans son she
went rigid with shame

  mark rose at last i must be getting
back to the plant but i am going to knock
off at four oclock id like to take pips
to the zoo

  crystal wanted to ask if she could go
too but the words stuck in her throat
she couldnt risk a curt refusal she
couldnt endure seeing the bleak hardness
curtaining marks eyes there was no
understanding this feeling within her that
soared at his pleasant nod or sank at in-
difference in his gaze but she deter-
mined to be ready when he came at four
and if he indicated by the slightest word
that she was included in the invitation
she would lose no time in accepting

  her plans went awry for after mark
left the puppy howled pips couldnt nap
for the disturbance over the phone die
manager informed her in an ominous tone
madam no dogs are allowed in this
apartment house your lease will be can-
celled unless you get rid of the animal
he added as an afterthought mr jan-
sens lease also specifies no children
pips cried when she broke the news to
him about blackie he hung on the dogs
neck and the puppy whined louder the
people in the adjoining apartment knocked
threateningly on the wall there was
nothing to do but to get pips dressed and
go out


new love magazine

  crystal thought they must have walked
around the block a dozen times when
mark brushed into them

  she couldnt help laughing we were
put out the three of us your lease says
no dogs and no children

  he glowered at her for a minute then
turned to signal a taxi okay well rent
a house pips should have a place to run
before she knew it the four of them
were in the back seat crystal was wedged
between mark and pips while blackie
scrambled over them

  mark gave the driver directions to a
real estate office

  crystal laid her hand on his arm no
mark i dont think youd better rent a
house no one knew what an effort it
cost her because suddenly a house with a
garden for pips to play in seemed the
most wonderful place in the world the
house mark had always dreamed of

  apparently he didnt notice her hand
on his sleeve why not well probably
find one not too far from the plant

  she was trembling so hard she had to
take a firm grip on herself

  because i realize how wrong i have
been to force you into this marriage i
still hold you responsible for philips
death in theory marriage was the only
solution i cant get that girl toni out of
my mind

  his face was a mask isnt it rather
late to let your conscience bother you
miserably she nodded i did behave
disgracefully but t was desperate i
couldnt bear to put pips in a home and
i couldnt take care of him any longer i
think i was on the verge of a breakdown
i see things differently now i can get a
quiet divorce you will be free to marry
toni pips and i wont bother you again
she looked up to meet the thunder in
his eyes fine the word seemed torn
from him now that you are fed and
coddled youve recovered from your brain
storm now that i love pips more than
anything on this earth you are going to
take him away from me just like that
mark i didnt mean-

  i know exactly what you mean its a
rather tame existence being the wife of
mark jansen there isnt the excitement
of travelling around the country the way
you did with phil its dull being stuck in

an apartment hotel it will be even duller
in a house in the suburbs

through clenched teeth crystal said i
suppose this is your way of punishing me
he looked at her so long she felt par-
alyzed i can think of more unpleasant
ways of punishing you

  he pulled her to him roughly and bent
to kiss her she was too astonished to
resist his mouth on hers aroused all the
starved loneliness and heartbreak that had
been concealed too long her lips re-
sponded giving him a glimpse of the
aching sweetness of her heart

  when he released her he made no at-
tempt to hide his own amazement that
was a crazy impulse he said unsteadily
it wont happen again

  crazy she repeated like a parrot
was it crazy or was it beautiful  what
was happening to her that she could still
feel the warmth of his mouth she would
not meet his gaze fearful he would read
in her eyes the knowledge she refused to
admit to her heart

  staring straight ahead she stammered
we cant go on like this let me get a
divorce

  his chin was a rock no i wont
give up pips

tt was a lovely house that mark final-
  ly selected

  like it crystal how about you
pips mark asked

  crystal nodded her throat too full for
words that kiss was still vivid each
step was a new link pulling her into a dan-
gerous abyss she had demanded mar-
riage but she had the feeling she would
be ultimately consumed in her own fire

  pips made no answer he was thump-
ing hard on a high key on the piano crys-
tal crossed to him sat beside him on the
upholstered bench i havent touched a
piano for years come sing this little
jingle with me pips

  that piano saved her pride in the fol-
lowing weeks it occupied her hands that
wanted to reach out and touch mark it
filled the thoughts that flew after him as
he strode down the hill to the plant she
knew intuitively he was seeing toni the
girls exotic fragrance clung to him once
upon emptying the pockets of an overcoat
to be sent to the cleaners she found a
marriage on demand



jewelled compact crystal slammed the
dresser drawer hard on the shining orna-
ment there wasnt the slightest reason
in the world for her to feel a twinge of
jealousy she knew mark loved toni
and if it werent for the demand she had
made on him they would have probably
been married she was caught in a trap
of her own making but she lived for those
brief glimpses she had of him

  the jingle book grew thick with songs
she sketched pips chubby figure and
blackie and the gray squirrel that scam-
pered across their frozen garden

  mark happened upon the book one day
crystal came into the living room to find
him playing the piano with one finger

  he looked across at her and the clear
blue of his eyes turned her heart complete-
ly over say this is clever crystal why
dont you publish it

  crystal had been pulling pips about the
garden on his sled there was snow on
her fur hood her cheeks were cold and
bright she had never seemed lovelier

  she shrugged tossed off her jacket and
hood i made them up for pips i doubt
if a publisher would even look at those
songs

  you wouldnt like to bet on it would
you his eyes beamed at her but it
dawned on her his smile was haggard

  she could see he was under some terrific
strain what is the matter she asked
frankly something at the plant
the plant is all right its-its toni
she is getting difficult making wild
threats i wish you would avoid her if
she does come out to the house 

  im sorry mark i can appreciate how
she feels

  i never thought toni would make
herself ridiculous after all this is some-
thing that cant be changed

  the pause lasted endless minutes are
you sure it cant be changed she
couldnt keep the tremor out of her voice

  quite sure so dont let her upset
you i have tried to end things decently
with toni but i havent done a good job
her hands stretched out to him  you
havent made a good job of it what have
i done then she was sobbing against
the broad expanse of his shoulder   
mark patted her shoulder he let her

cry it out its all right darling he
whispered

  she wasnt sure about that darling
it might have been a trick of her imagina-
tion or it could have been because she
wanted so desperately to hear tenderness
in his deep voice

  his eyes were shielded from her probing
gaze as he put on his overcoat through
the french doors pips called for another
ride her heart fluttering like an uncaged
bird crystal went out to him they
waved to mark slithering down the steep
incline they built a snow man with a
paper hat and blackie dug at its feet send-
ing snow flurries in all directions crystal
laughed and pips squealed and it was as
if everything was right in the world

 when it was dusk and pips nose
glowed from the cold they went in

a nd there was the girl toni beauti-
fully at home in marks favorite chair
the ash tray heaped with stubs indicated
she had been there a long time the slant-
ing dark eyes were hard and there was a
reckless defiance in the way she slid out
of her mink coat

  crystal said hello you dont mind if
i get pips out of all these clothes

  toni replied i have plenty of time
crystal urged him out of the room
saying give blackie a good rub-down
toni said nothing even after pips had
made a flying leap at blackie a spasm of
fear rocked crystals heart mark told
her not to worry hut she couldnt still
the apprehension which was spreading
through her yet a flicker of sympathy
mingled with her emotion toni loved
mark too

  toni smiled a thin stretch of her lips
arent you curious why i am here
should  be

 she shrugged mark warned me
against coming

  crystal said there isnt anything you
can say that i havent told myself it
seemed right at the time to force mark to
marry me he was responsible for philips
death pips needed a father i didnt
know about you frankly i dont think
it would have stopped me if i had
there was an odd glint in tonis eyes
her smoldering hostility was a white-hot
flame her voice was throaty with anger


new love magazine

as she cried mark didnt marry you be-
cause you forced him he says it was be-
cause of pips i dont believe it it was
because he loves you

  crystals shrill doubting laughter was
startling in the stillness if ever a man
hated a woman who blackmailed him into
marriage mark hates me

  tonis gesture discounted that thrust
she cried harshly why else would he
conceal from you the real facts about
philip

crystal could feel the blood draining
from her face she had the sickening
feeling she was going to faint what do
you know about philip she demanded

  toni blazed i was with him that night
in marks car dont look so alarmed
phil didnt mean anything to me nor i
to him mark and i met him in a cocktail
bar he was celebrating something a re-
turn from a long trip somewhere i was
provoked at mark i tried to make him
jealous by flirting with phil phil and i
drank too much and mark just sat there
looking like a thundercloud we thought
it would be fun to go for a ride in his car
phili-p was driving those hoarse
words were coming from crystals throat

  toni shook from sheer hysteria the
horror of that awful ride was in her eyes

  her voice said thickly i didnt know
phil was so far gone the car kept weav-
ing i didnt have the strength to twist it
back on the road i think i fainted i
couldnt remember the crash mark got
there first he had followed us in phils
car i was uninjured he got me out i
phoned for the ambulance and called my
father he is the sheriff you know
crystal didnt know she was too
stunned to feel anything

  tonis brittle voice was saying my
father agreed to marks story that he was
driving and it was an unavoidable acci-
dent dad didnt want me mixed up in it
crystal pressed her cold fingers against
her temples it seemed as if her head was
swelling until it would burst

  why did they let me go on in such a
fools paradise she thought she screamed

the question but her moving lips sent forth
only a harsh whisper

  i wanted to tell you but mark
wouldnt let me he wanted you to keep
your ideal of phil intact and i wanted
mark so much i traded on that queer
quirk in his brain i knew he would even
marry me to keep the knowledge from you
i never supposed you would make this
marriage demand on him mark never
loved me i know it now i tried to take it
like a good sport and i couldnt maybe
he doesnt realize he loves you but a man
who goes to such lengths to protect a girl
is giving a pretty fair imitation of it

  toni i offered him his freedom he
wouldnt give up pips

  toni rose wearily i came here intend-
ing to shoot the works i watched pips
playing in the snow and it all sizzled out
of me he is a miracle boy

  he has a miracle mother from the
doorway came marks quiet voice how
long he had been there crystal didnt
know she felt numb and confused her
world had split wide open her accusa-
tions against mark were horrible now that
she knew the truth she felt stripped
there was not one bit of pride left
through a haze she knew toni had gone

  mark crossed the room to her

  he drew her to her feet crystal

  what can i say  her eyes were hum-
ble and pleading

  do you need to say anything toni
is wiser than i thought yes i listened
shamelessly i do love you i didnt real-
ize it until now i think i fell in love with
you when i stayed with you and phil
pips was a toddler and you were the most
beautiful sight in the world i think i
would have given my life to protect you
both it was a most idealistic love lately
it has been unsatisfied-since that kiss in
the taxi

  then you felt it too i demanded mar-
riage-

  im demanding love for now and
always

  it was a new beginning of a marriage
that had begun in misunderstanding the
deep look that passed between them held a
glorious promise for the future

the end

genie had made up her mind she
was love-proof-until she kissed
a man who gave her the bruslioff

they streaked down the parkway
and suzy q held her black head
high

at four-thirty on a cloudy

parked her sisters travel-stained

small city somewhere in the usa you




new love magazine

wait here sarah she said briskly and
move the car if im gone over an hour
we dont want to add a parking ticket
to our problems

  sarah garden made a gallant effort to
smile but her lips were dry her cheeks
swollen and her eyes tired ill keep
my fingers crossed she said

  and tommy genie spoke to the five-
year-old who was zooming an airplane on
the back seat using a suitcase for a land-
ing base suppose you sit up front and
tell your mummy the story i read you
this morning about the deer that walked
into a hotel lobby-remember

  aw wight tommy said flinging a
chubby leg over the seat and tumbling
after

  im not coming back genie promised
them until mr peter henderson agrees
to let you have that apartment were not
going to spend another night in that
dismal tourist cabin she dropped a
nickel in the parking meter and marched
into a street floor office marked in tall
gold letters

peter henderson

real estate

  i want to see mr peter henderson
please she said to the elderly secretary
ensconced behind a vast mahogany desk
on a very important matter

  the woman appraised genie with a
trained eye did you wish to look at
houses or apartments  at the moment we
have only-

  neither genie said bluntly i said
i wish to speak to mr henderson
abort a-a personal matter
perhaps yes perhaps no

  the secretary hesitated unable to cata-
logue genie properly very well she
said uncertainly the third door to your
left

  thank you with a brief smile
genie crossed the room opened the third
door on the left and entered without
knocking

  for twenty-four hours she had visu-
alized peter henderson as a deaf old
gentleman bald as an egg and rather
dapper therefore she was momentarily
stunned to discover a very young peter
henderson in wrinkled tweeds slouched
behind another vast mahogany desk with

his big feet propped up on a window
ledge he was pipe-smoking and ob-
viously day-dreaming

  at the sudden unexpected swish of a
womans skirt he unwound himself and
sat up there was a hint of reproach in
the wide-apart gray eyes as if she had
derailed an important train of thought

  genies amber eyes met his gray gaze
levelly her mouth was set in stern young
lines her slender body in a blue gaber-
dine suit was tense she looked as if
she might coil up and spring at him at
the slightest provocation but instead she
blew a light brown curl off her forehead
and began crisply mr henderson
in the flesh he said irrelevantly
the spirit is taking the day off he
unwound his long legs still further and
stood up if you wish to confer with
me why dont we sit down

  look genie seated herself on the
edge of a chair my sister and i have
scoured this city of yours for three days
searching for a small furnished apart-
ment the only one available is in the
bellepoint apartments which i under-
stand belongs to you

  he busied himself digging ashes out of
his pipe pausing occasionally to look at
her and finally to make a statement i
have a resident manager there a mrs
harold stone who has charge of leasing
the apartments you should talk to
her 

  we have talked to her genie ex-
claimed and that old hatchet faced
zinnia told my sister that she couldnt have
the apartment on account of tommy
that old hatchet faced zinnia peter
remarked dryly is a friend of mine who
is tommy

  my nephew the smartest youngster
this side of the quiz kids

  how old is he

  hell be five tomorrow

  the young realtor frowned darkly and
shook his head we do not allow chil-
dren or dogs in the bellepoint that
particular apartment building happens to
be the quietest smartest and most ex-
clusive-

  ive seen it genie broke in so you
neednt spread it on quite so thickly the
bellepoint is no more and no less attrac-
tive than dozens of other apartments in
no romance for genie



dozens of other cities the only reason
my sister wants that particular apart-
ment is because it is absolutely the only
furnished one vacant in this city and be-
cause it is near the new air depot you
see she wants to be with her husband
lieutenant thomas garden- as much as
possible until he is sent to africa or
australia or russia or one of those
places on the other side of the globe-
especially with the baby coming

  his eyebrows soared oh theres go-
ing to be another child

  she nodded in a couple of months
more or less and theyre terribly thrilled
about it but if you ask me a girl is
courting trouble camp-following a hus-
band all over however tom wants her
and sarah wants tom and who am i to
judge  so ive brought her to him again
and im going to stick around until she is
settled comfortably then im coming
back to look after her two toms while
little phyllis is being born

  phyllis eh he laid his pipe aside
and genie observed an encouraging eye
flicker

  yes phyllis naturally sarah and
tom cant afford hotel rates on a lieu-
tenants commutation and every boarding
house already is bursting at the seams
for the past three nights they have bunked
in a tourist cabin that smells and leaks
leaving most of their belongings in the
car so you see how important it is for
them to have that apartment

peter stood up again and shoved his
hands deep into his pockets his frown
widened but ive already told you-
we do not allow children in the belle-
point

  or dogs genie added but tommy
doesnt have a dog-yet i promised to
give him one of ladys puppies when
theyre born im going to bring it with
me when i return lady is a blonde
cocker-

  now wait a minute miss- what is
your name

  eugenia craig

  miss craig this is all very interesting
and romantic and gallant and patriotic
and all that and id like to be of service
to you especially since your brother-in-
law is a low ranking army officer with a

wife and kid on his neck but that is his
misfortune not mine for the third and
last time i repeat we do not allow chil-
dren or dogs in the bellepoint

  genie drew a sharp breath what kind
of country would we have fifty years from
now mr peter henderson she flashed
out if every property owner made a
rule against children

  never thought much about it he
retorted my old man built the apart-
ment and made the rule im just carry-
ing on where he left off

  and what kind of tenants do you
have in your precious apartment she
continued scornfully id like to line
them up and look them over a fine col-
lection of-of ostriches they must be
he made a noise in his throat that
sounded to genie like a cross between
a chuckle and a growl i think id better
get you a glass of water before you blow
a fuse

  id be willing to blow a fuse she
said tensely if that would make you lift
your head out of the sand these are
not normal times mr henderson that
rule of yours should be scrapped at least
for the duration theres enough of a
housing problem everywhere without your
adding to it what kind of a citizen are
you anyway why arent you in uni-
form you look able-bodied to me and
my guess is youre not a day over twenty-
four

  twenty-five he grinned and i
expect to be in uniform by the end of
this week

  oh genies hand flew to her mouth
sorry i took that poke at you it was
unfair and impertinent

  on the contrary he assured her i
regard it as a very fair and pertinent
question to ask any able-bodied young
man in civilian clothes he walked over
to a cooler and filled a glass drink
this slowly and quietly he commanded
her and permit me to say a few words
without interruption

  she obeyed her eyes focussed upon him
with obvious distrust

  if i should agree to break the rules
for the duration set the other tenants
howling let your sister and her lieutenant
and tommy and phyllis have that apart-
ment would you- he regarded her


new love magazine

thoughtfully no i dont expect you
would

  would i what  she asked curiously
would you agree to-to let me take
you out to dinner-say every night this
week you see im leaving saturday for
camp and i want somebody to-well
help me celebrate my induction into the
army as a buck private

  she almost choked on a swallow of
water whats the matter with your
home town girls she asked warily
arent they all pining over you

  oh sure he said easily thats why
i prefer to spend my last evenings with
you i-i dont want to be pinned over
i genie stated complacently
wouldnt pine over any man her eyes
suddenly narrowed its a deal she
bargained provided vou let my sister
have the apartment for fifty dollars a
month she cant afford to pay a cent
more

  but its listed at seventy-five j

  you probably upped it to seventy-
five she said dryly about the time
ihe government started building an air
depot nearby

  he acknowledged defeat with a broad
grin all right you win fifty dollars
and five dinners ill draw up a lease
fifty dollars and four dinners she
corrected him beginning tomorrow
night and dont put the-the dinners in
the lease tom and sarah neednt know
about that im a girl of my word and
furthermore i can take care of myself
i believe you the deal was closed
with a firm handshake

promptly at six-thirty the follow-
ing evening peter knocked on b-l of
the bellepoint apartments and was ad-
mitted by tow-headed tommy gome
in sir he said brightly were bof
ready

  did he say bo peter inquired of
genie who was standing in the middle
of the living room wearing a rare costume
jewel of a smile and a compelling outfit
of grey flannel with a red dotted blouse
and a giey beret

  im afraid he did she retorted gaily
you see its his birthday and i promised
him a party he worked like a steam
shovel today helping us unpack besides

his mummy and dad are dining with
the c o tonight tommy wasnt in-
vited do you mind

  oh no peter assured her im de-
lighted 

  i was sure you would be she placed
tommy between them in peters blue
roadster and he chattered away about
airpanes and jeeps and sheen guns as
they streaked down the parkway

  they dined in state at the lakeside
inn with tommy sitting in a highchair
between them at any moment genie
expected peter to start sulking because
she had dragged him along so she was
emotionally unprepared for his big brother
act he made a tremendous fuss over
tommys birthday ordering a cake with
five candles singing happy birthday
dear tommy in an elastic accordian-
tenor voice and insisting that they must
treat him to a wild west movie

  it was a double feature and long before
the last villain was slain tommy was
sleeping noisily his head on genies lap
his feet stretched across peters ktiees

  when they reached the apartment
peter shoveled him into bed and stood
by while genie took off his coat cap
shoes and socks they tiptoed out to-
gether

  at the door genie held out her hand
thank you she said sweetly for
being so nice to tommy and me

  bring him along tomorrow night
peter suggested with an odd grimace if
youre still afraid of me

  her eyes opened wide oh but im
not

  liar he said softly but sweet
good night

  on the next night after giving the
matter constant thought genie decided
to risk dining alone with peter henderson
just to prove to him that she was not
afrard but when lie ushered her into
his car she found the front seat partially
occupied by an enormous kerry blue
terrier who stared at her out of doleful
brown eyes

  this is susy q peter announced
lightly she has a standing engagement
with me on wednesday nights and since
this is my last wednesday night at home
i couldnt conscientiously leave her be-
hind hope you dont mind
no romance for genie



  not at all genie assured him im
delighted

  i was quite sure you would be he
grinned

  once more they streaked down the
parkway this time with susy q sitting
between them holding her black head high
peter turned into the parking area of a
hot shoppe and ordered hamburgers
french frieds pie and coffee for three
they discovered that they both liked
coffee with cream and no sugar ham-
burgers with plenty of everything and
sweet potato pie susy o drank her
coffee straight

  with their hunger appeased peter
turned a disarming smile genies way
what shall we do now 

  what do you and susy q usually do
on wednesday nights she inquired

  we usually take a long walk through
the park

  thats my dish genie said

  it was a lovely night for a long walk
through the park until an angry thunder
storm caught up with them and chased
them into the band pavilion there wet
and chilled they waited in a huddle while
the rain fell in silver ropes

  youre cold peter said finally wrap-
ping his arms about her

  she moved away i am not

  there was a long uneasy silence broken
only by the sound of rain on the roof
peter decided to try a more direct
approach

  id like to kiss you genie

  it isnt in the deal her voice was
taut

  then peter challenged her why
not put it in at once

  he stooped to kiss her but she quickly
turned her face away there was just
a fragment of a kiss between them but
even so it was somehow different often
in the past disturbing months genie had
stated to sarah and to many of her girl
friends who were marrying and snatching
a few weeks of so-called happiness while
they could that no mans kiss could dis-
turb her clutter up her life with camp-
following and heartbreak she was in-
vulnerable thank goodness yet here she
was feeling suddenly tender and startled
and angry and frightened over practically
no kiss at all

 susy q growled at her and peter
laughed shes jealous he said to-
morrow night ill leave her at home
there isnt going to be any tomorrow
night genie said darkly

  still afraid of me peter challenged
her and genie shook her head vigorously

deep in the night genie told herself
that the smart thing for her to do
was to exit with a whole heart she
promised herself to leave the next day
sarah was comfortably settled in the
apartment and tom could come home for
lunch often there was no reason at all
why she should stay on any longer

  but sarah wakened the following morn-
ing feeling so ill that genie ordered her
to stay in bed she prepared breakfast
lunch and dinner and washed all of
tommys clothes there was no time for
her to pack her bag or see about a ticket

  toward late afternoon another reason
for staying over materialized the belle-
point tenants had greeted the newcomers
with annoyed stares especially mrs
stone the hatchet faced zinnia she lived
down the hall with an astonishingly
beautiful daughter who had gray-green
eyes and taffy-colored hair genie de-
cided it would be a fine idea for her to
make at least one friend in the building
for sarah to turn to

  but when she met mrs stones daugh-
ter in the hall and threw out her friend-
liest smile as a trial balloon the other
girl glared at her coldly and disappeared
in her own apartment

  oh well genie muttered sarah has
tom and tommy and phyllis and ill be
back in a few weeks when there wont
be any peter henderson around to com-
plicate my life meantime ill just take
a shower and put on my yellow silk with
the red jacket

  at six-thirty her bright head was
pressed against the window she told
sarah that she was watching the sunset
actually she was keeping an eye out for
a chap in a blue roadster

  seven oclock came and then seven-
thirty at eight she began to feel queer
around the edges of her stomach at
eight-thirty she left the window forever
at nine oclock sarah persuaded her to
sit down and eat some dinner the food

was cold and soggy and tasteless at ten
oclock tom said genie since youre
all dressed up with no place to go how
about riding out to the depot with me
ive got to check over some matters with
the o d

  she went because she wanted to prove
to herself that she wasnt the kind of
girl who sat around waiting all evening
for any man but the moment tom drove
away from the apartment she regretted
having accepted his invitation she
wanted desperately to turn back

  it was on the drive back from the
depot that genie saw peters blue road-
ster parked in a lovers nook on the side
of the road etched in the bright moon-
light were two heads bent close peter
and some other girl some strange new
emotion needled genies heart in so many
places that it was practically raw

  this must be lovers lane tom
laughed

  genie tried to manufacture a bit of
bright repartee but somehow the words
wouldnt jell

  whats the matter honey tom in-
quired youre awfully quiet tonight

  im fine genie said never felt
better in my life

she went to bed at once and turned
out the light what she needed she
told herself sternly was a good nights
sleep tommy snuggled against her taut
body and kicked her occasionally she
spanked his legs and turned him over
her eyes stung in the darkness peter
henderson was the most contradictory
man shed ever met he didnt want
children or dogs in his apartment build-
ing yet he was grand with tommy and
susy q adored him he made a deal
with her for fifty dollars and four din-
ners and then calmly ignored it he kissed
a girl and then brushed her off he   

  the telephone rang at twelve oclock
genie was out of the bed before the
last tinkle had died away hello she
said very sleepilv

  genie

  oh-its you she flattened her
voice out like a plank

  listen genie ive got to see you
will you meet me in the drive  we could
swing around the block a time or two

i can be there in two minutes flat
ive retired genie said firmly i
was asleep you shouldnt call people
in the middle of the night

  but ive got to tell you why i-why
im so late 

  it doesnt matter in the least genie
said you dont have to explain your
actions to me and vice-versa

  please genie

  she pressed her lips tightly together
so you wont talk eh all right
neither will i-until six-thirty tomorrow
night see you then

  i wont be here im going home to-
morrow

  with that announcement she dropped
the receiver in its cradle she did not
go back to bed until her clothes were
flung into a bag and she had called the
station about a train there was one at
ten the next morning

  there was gloom for breakfast because
genie was leaving tommy cried when
he was told and after breakfast genie
took him on her lap and read him a
story and then another and then an-
other

  when it was time for her to dress
sarah came in and sat on the edge of
the bed i shouldnt beg you to stay
she said but oh genie please dont
go

  i must genie said ill be back
next month or sooner if you need me
i suppose well be moving back to the
tourist cabin soon sarah said slowly
her eyes clouded with hurt im afraid
theyre going to run us out of here

  genie turned sharply what do you
mean

  the janitor told me this morning that
mrs stone has called a meeting of all
the tenants in the building for seven-
thirty tonight in her apartment a-a
sort of indignation meeting

  why why genie sputtered she
cant do that to us

  it seems sarah went on unhappily
that all the tenants are raging because
mr henderson leased b-l to a couple with
a small child and a stork hovering

  i cant believe genie ejaculated
that every tenant in this building would
go into a rage over a thing like that i
just cant believe it she dropped her
no romance for genie



hat on the bed stripped off her suit and
hung it away in the closet im staying
she announced grimly i wouldnt miss
that indignation meeting for anything
but were-youre not invited
then ill crash it have you told
t om  

  no hes got enough on his mind
as is besides im afraid liell send me
home and i dont want to leave him i
want to be with him no matter where
we have to live

  you love that guy an awful lot
yes sarah said softly lifting shin-
ing eyes enough to live in that tourist
cabin and like it if i have to

  dont you worry genie said tom
wont send you home and the belle-
point tenants wont throw you out either
just leave it to me

rthe telephone did not ring at all that
day but peter rapped on the door
promptly at six-thirty genie received
him coolly

  oh he greeted her lightly i thought
you were going home today

 changed my mind she replied
shortly

  i knew you were a girl of your word
his eyes approved of her in the blue
gaberdine where would you like to
go for dinner

  im not eating dinner tonight

  oh yes you are you owe me two
dinners genie i thought we could eat
one of them now and the other at mid-
night im going away myself tomorrow
-remember

  i dont owe you anything genie
said if you can break one dinner en-
gagement so can i

  the deal was simply that you were
to eat four dinners with me the score
is now two down and two to go i saved
two of them for tonight because-well
because this is my last    

  thats a very pallid excuse genie
exclaimed not she added hastily
that i care what you did last night
im going to tell you about last night
after dinner he took hold of her arm
come on genie-with-the-light-brown-
hair give me a smile i have a wonder-
ful restaurant where they serve marvelous
steaks

  she shook him off im not interested
ive got to go to an indignation meeting
at seven-thirty

  an indignation meeting

  yes your tenants are meeting in
mrs stones apartment at seven-thirty
to discuss ways and means of ousting
lieutenant and mrs garden tommy
and stork theyre probably planning to
work up a petition to present to you be-
fore you leave town a petition or an
ultimatum or something

  in that case peter frowned ive
got to go to an indignation myself you
let me handle this genie it isnt neces-
sary for you to fight my battles besides
theres more to this than meets the eye
its my battle genie persisted be-
cause i persuaded you to break your
apartment rules you let me handle it
you and tom have far bigger battles to
fight i can take care of this little one
myself

  i dont doubt it nevertheless i
want to handle it i-i have a reason
genie you see it isnt really the tenants
who are angry theyre just following
the leader mrs stone and-edna
edna

  mrs stones daughter

  why are they so angry

  theyre out for revenge peter ad-
mitted because you-because we-be-
cause i said goody-by to edna last night
without asking her to marry me or wait
for me or anything apparently they
think im-dont laugh -an excellent
catch or did

  she lifted puzzled eyes but what
lias that got to do  

  im coming to that its because of-
edna he confessed reluctantly that i
asked you to dine with me every night
this week as a safety measure to keep
me from tumbling you see ednas
rather persistent and she had me going
when you marched into my office mon-
day afternoon i was trying to figure a
way out i didnt want to go off to war
with a bride slung over my shoulder
instead of a gun nor did i want to
leave a bride weeping at home i wanted
to be free and unencumbered with no
housing problem no emotional respon-
sibilities no desperate partings

  genie drew a sharp breath so mrs

stone and edna are really striking at me
-not at the gardens

  theyre striking at you and me
peter admitted

  then of course ive got to be there
genie said to strike back not for my-
self you understand but for sarah
youre sweet and i love you peter
said

  genies eyes sparkled angrily dont
say things like that to me she said we
understand each other perfectly now you
used me-

  peter glanced at his watch its time
for the indignation meeting he said we
can have one of our own later ill be
back the door closed behind him

  genie waited fifteen minutes then
marched down the hall and rapped sharp-
ly on the door of the stone apartment

  it opened quickly and edna stared
at her through narrowed gray-green eyes
what do you want miss craig

  i understand theres a meeting going
on here that concerns apartment b-l
genie said im the official family repre-
sentative do you mind she brushed
past edna and stood inside the room
looking around

  there were a half dozen men and about
a dozen women in the room peter was
leaning against the window his arms
folded a pipe between his teeth mrs
stone was making a speech

  we have leases which state clearly
she was saying that no apartment in
this building shall be rented to a couple
with minor children mr henderson has
deliberately gone over my head in this
matter he has broken his pledge to all
of us i feel that we owe it to ourselves
to protect our rights she faced peter
dramatically mr henderson unless
you remove this family from our midst
we will institute suit for breach of con-
tract

  an elderly sweet-faced lady arose id
like to suggest mrs stone that peter
simply make an adjustment in the rents
we were paying extra for peace and
quiet undoubtedly we will now have a
daily ration of shouts and cries and such
with our income taxes running so high
it might be wise for us to endure a child
or two for the economy of reduced rent
genie moved forward and said em-

phatically id like to point out 

  but before she could point out anything
mrs stone broke in sharply i dont
think there is anything you could say
that would be of interest to us miss
craig

  but i insist genie said you
see-

  yes we see edna heckled we see
that youre intruding into our affairs
please go before i-

  this is ridiculous genie began but
peter calmly stepped forward and took
over

  sit down genie its my turn to make
a speech he cleared his throat ladies
and gentlemen i want to inform you that
mrs stone is no longer the resident man-
ager of the bellepoint she is dismissed
as of this moment her lease is up on
may  and after that she will no longer
live here

  mrs stone clicked her teeth sharply
and edna muttered something under her
breath

  now that thats settled peter con-
tinued i want to discuss mrs deerings
suggestion it is disillusioning and dis-
turbing to discover that a kindly person
such as mrs deering is reacting from one
viewpoint only-her own these are not
normal times mrs deering wc are in a
war an air depot is being built near us
and officers have been sent here to super-
vise its construction and organization
they have families who want to be with
them it is up to us to help them find
places to live make them comfortable
rather than fight to oust them or merely
endure them we should welcome than
with open arms children dogs stork and
all our rule against children must be
scrapped for the duration

  that was the way i reasoned when 
rented apartment b-l to lieutenant and
mrs garden what would this country
be like fifty years from now i asked
myself if every property owner made a
similar rule against children  think that
over calmly what kind of people are we
anyway that we set ourselves off in a
lovely quiet spot and howl just because
we are going to hear a little boy shouting
or perhaps a babys cries arent we be-
having like-like ostriches i tell you
weve got to take our heads out of the
no romance for genie



sand and start behaving the way human
beings should

  sue me for breach of contract if you
will but i dont think you will he sat
down abruptly and everybody cheered ex-
cept mrs stone and edna

the applause covered genies depart-
ure she sped down the hall and out
the side entrance into the cool of the
night her throat hurt and for the first
time in her life she wanted to cry she
suddenly felt sorry for edna and sorry
for herself

  she felt a sudden overwhelming sorrow
for any girl who was enough of a marsh-
mallow to fall in love in nineteen hundred
forty-three

  i ought to hate him she told herself
he used me to get rid of her and now
he is going away i might never see him
again i ought to hate him and im going
to

  hey genie a voice called behind her
wait for me

  she began running but lie caught up
with her quickly and his hands closed
over her arm whats the big idea-
running from me how did you like my
speech i took the words right out of
your mouth didnt i it worked genie

i left them arguing about who was to call
on your sister first now we can go eat
those two dinners you owe me now that
everything is okay

  she was breathing hard im still not
hungry

  neither am i with rough fingers
he drew her closer ive got too much on
my mind such as-whether or not youre
going to face it squarely the way im
doing he said with a determined look on
his face

  face what

  us love marriage kids dogs
the whole works genie in spite of the
war in spite of the harsh undeniable fact
that im leaving for camp tomorrow
she looked up then startled and he
kissed her but-but you said you didnt
want 

  makes no difference what i said i
didnt want he kissed her again
makes no difference what you said you
didnt want either im sunk genie ive
got to have you near me as long as im
training it wont be easy but you know
that do you mind

  genie drew a long breath her eyes
began to shine in the darkness im sunk
too she said softly and i-i actually
felt sorry for sarah

deception is the one thing a man hates in the woman he
loves but in order to live up to the role bing had created
for her ann had to keep her identity a secret

ann creighton slipped her
old camel hair coat on over the
simple leaf-brown jersey picked
up her purse and ran down the three
flights from her one-room walk-up it
was two oclock in the morning but she
was simply too excited to sleep

  and what girl wouldnt be she said
to herself as she reached the street with
a crisp pink check for fifty-thousand dol-
lars in her purse

  the check was for movie rights to fair
tomorrow her very first book she had
been excited enough when the manuscript
was accepted for publication and more
so as it climbed steadily to the top of the
best seller lists but a sale to the movies
was something she had to pinch herself
to believe she had been in a daze ever
since her publisher handed her the check
that afternoon

  now she felt a little as though she
were floating instead of walking down the
deserted street the bitter february wind
whipped the short brown curls back from
her face but she scarcely felt it opposite
a book store window she paused a mo-
ment to glance at the display in the eerie
reflection cast by the dimmed-out street
lamp yes fair tomorrow was featured
prominently

  fair tomorrow by lucinda lowry
ann real aloud pressing her small pert
nose to the cold glass lucinda lowry
she repeated and giggled such a silly
name why on earth hadnt she used
ann creighton

 she turned from the window and
strolled on knowing quite well why she
had chosen a pen name she had been
so sure the book was no good-

  the girls she had known at boarding


school would be amazed to know that lu-
cinda lowry was quiet shy little ann
creighton the four years at fashionable
beverly hall were a nightmare in anns
mind she had gone there on a scholar-
ship made possible by an influential friend
of her dead parents ann had been an
orphan for longer than she cared to re-
member her father had been a country
doctor whose legacy was a collection of
unpaid bills

  some of the girls had been sweet and
kind to ann but there had been a few
who were cruel as only girls of that age
can be to one another there was mar-
cella drayton for instance who had
roomed with nn for one year and con-
stantly flaunted her lovely clothes in anns
face the thoughts of marcella always
rankled

  ann reached the corner and without
pausing turned and stepped off the curb

  she stepped straight in front of a car
i hat was almost r before sh saw it
desperately she flung herself back as
brakes screeching the car swerved but
she knew even before the fender hit her
that she could not possibly escape she
had the sensation of being lifted bodily
and flung through the air before landing
in a crumpled heap in the gutter her
head struck the curb and neon-lights ex-
ploded in her brain

vvhen she opened her eyes a red-
 headed young man was kneeling be-
side her vigorously chafing her wrists
as though id simply fainted ann
thought indignantly abruptly he leaned
forward and saw that her eyes were open

  he let out a long ragged breath then
practically shouted if you wanted to
her eyes wandered over the crowd
and suddenly she gave a strangled
gasp what was bing doing at a
literary cocktail party


new love magazine

commit suicide why didnt you go jump
off the bridge instead of stepping in front
of my car

  suicide ann sat up with a jerk
completely forgetting that a moment be-
fore she had strongly suspected that every
bone in her body was broken i wasnt
trying to kill myself you fool

  he shrugged impatiently oh of
course not you just get your setting-up
exercise by stepping out in front of speed-
ing cars here- he put his hands be-
neath her elbows-lets see if you can
stand up

  ann practically bounced to her feet
jerking herself away from him she tilted
her chin and glared at him im quite
all right she said coldly please dont
let me delay you any longer he had
the broadest shoulders and the reddest
hair she had ever seen-and the most
stubborn chin what was the use of try-
ing to explain to that sort of a chin that
the whole thing had been an accident
unaccountably her lips suddenly began
to tremble and two large tears coursed
down her cheeks

  the young mans blue eyes drifted from
her bare head down the length of her
shabby last years coat and came back
to rest on the worn leather purse she still
clutched you poor kid he said softly
taking her arm you dont think id go
off and leave you feeling like this do
you no siree but bing layton rescu-
ing damsels in distress is one of the things
i do best now just come along with me
and well go over to that all night restau-
rant there and get some food into that
empty little tummy of yours you have
no idea what a difference that will make
as he talked he was propelling her rapid-
ly across the street

  but im not hungry ann exclaimed
i mean that is-im not starving for
abruptly she realized that she was hungry
she had been far too excited to eat any
dinner and lunch had been one sandwich
and a glass of milk with a smothered
little laugh she relaxed and let him lead
her on into the restaurant after all he
owed her a meal for being so rude to her

  without consulting her he ordered
soup french fried potatoes and steak
and coffee right away he finished

  the bossy type ann decided

  and now he leaned back in his
chair and smiled at her a slow lazy smile
that lifted one corner of his mouth higher
than the other before we go any farther
i think youd better tell me the one thing
i dont know about you-your name
im ann creighton ann lifted her
winged dark brows but its most cer-
tainly not the one thing you dont know
about me

  he chuckled im a reporter and its
my business to know things youre-
he paused and studied her for a moment
youre about twenty-two or three and
youre out of a job-or more likely never
had one you came to the big city with
high hopes of making a name for your-
self and when you failed you couldnt
bear to go back to the home town and ad-
mit defeat when youd spent your last
two-bits-for coffee and doughnuts yes-
terday morning probably-you decided
there was only one thing to do

  anns eyes rested on her purse and
she had to fight back a desire to burst into
hysterical laughter what would mr
bing layton do she wondered if she
suddenly opened that purse and flashed
a fifty-thousand dollar check in his face
it was almost too much of a temptation to
resist but she was beginning to enjoy this
absurd situation so she merely smiled at
him and murmured thats awfully
clever of you mr layton

  bing he said absently nobody
ever calls me mr layton the waiter
set down two cups of coffee and bing
pushed the sugar bowl toward her
weve got to find a job for you he said
thoughtfully now just what can you
do

  well- anns thick lashes fluttered
down over her gold-flecked brown eyes
i always thought id like to write

  to her surprise bing layton snapped
his fingers of course why didnt i
think of it before one of our copy-girls
left last week to join the waacs your
saying write reminded me of it im sure
i can get that job for you of course
he added grinning you wont do much
writing but at least youll eat regularly

so thats how ann creighton with
fifty thousand dollars in the bank and
royalties from fair tomorrovj piling up
lovely little liar



daily came to go to work as a copy girl
on the morning clarion she hadnt had
the least intention of doing any such
thing in fact she had fully intended to
tell bing layton all about herself before
they parted that night but he had been
so boyishly pleased over what he termed
his good deed for the day that she
hadnt had the heart to disillusion him
not just then anyway

  he left her at her apartment with a
blithe dont worry about your back
rent now ill see that you get an ad-
vance first thing in the morning so you
can take care of it

  but she had every intention of writing
him a note in the morning explaining the
situation

  she awoke at sunrise feeling oddly ex-
cited and decided abruptly that she would
take the job after all it might be an in-
teresting experience and as an author
she needed all the experience she could
get didnt she besides she had been
trying for weeks to get started on a new
book and so far hadnt written a word
working in a big newspaper office might
suggest some idea for a plot

  but when she had put on a trim little
beige suit with a lettuce green blouse and
a perky green hat pulled down on her
curls she looked in the mirror and made
a little face at her reflection shame on
you ann creighton she said aloud
you know perfectly well why youre do-
ing this you want to see bing layton
again and youre afraid if you tell him the
truth hell feel so ridiculous over the mis-
take he made last night that hell never
want to see you again

  of course she would have to tell him
sometime but perhaps when he got to
know her - and like her - maybe he
wouldnt mind

  but two weeks passed and still she
hadnt told bing and certainly it wasnt
because he didnt like her as for ann
from almost the moment she saw him
again that first morning she had known
she was in love with him and she had
always believed so fervently that love
should be based on long friendship and
mutual likes and dislikes how could
she have fallen in love with a man about
whom she knew next to nothing that
was what she thought that first day-

  but after two weeeks of lunching with
bing every day and going out with him
every evening the trouble was that she
knew too much about him he didnt like
career girls so how could she tell him
that she was one he definitely disap-
proved of a poor man marrying a rich
girl so how could she tell him she was
getting richer every day when his own
salary was a mere forty-five a week  and
worst of all one day when she mentioned
fair tomorrow just to see what he would
say he exploded that cloying ado-
lescent melo-drama so how could she
possibly tell him she had written it

  if he falls in love with me-and please
god let him-ill tell him then she fi-
nally decided

  and almost as though god had heard
that little prayer and answered it prompt-
ly it was that very night bing told her
he loved her

  driving home from a late movie bing
stopped the car abruptly at the corner
where he had run into her that night

  what gives ann asked with a puz-
zled glance

  he slipped an arm about her shoulders
and drew her close tilting her chin with
one hand ive a sentimental attachment
for this spot he said softly shall i
tell you why

  she nodded her heart suddenly pound-
ing

  because right here is where i first
saw the girl i love the girl i hope to
make my wife his eyes held hers for a
moment then he added will you
ann

  of course ann told him simply

  and then she was crushed in his arms
his lips hard against hers their hearts
pounding in unison and there was no
reality except this miracle that had hap-
pened bing loved her and was asking her
to marry him

  slowdy reluctantly their lips parted
finally as though neither of them wanted
that kiss to end rubbing his cheek
against her tumbled curls he said huskily
for years ive dreamed of finding a girl
like you my ann sweet and little and
cuddly the kind of girl who needs a man
to take care of her smart yes but not
too smart-an old-fashioned girl who
wants nothing more from life than to


new love magazine

make a home for the man she loves
oh dear ann thought miserably im
really not at all like that do-do you
think its really so important what two
people are like as long as they truly love
each other she asked in a muffled little
voice

  of course its important bing
chuckled oh ill grant you that a man
might fall in love with a girl who didnt
fit his ideas of what he wanted in a wife
but hed be a fool to marry her a mar-
riage like that is jinxed before it starts
take me for instance there was a time
-before i met you of course-when i
might have fallen in love with a girl
named marcella drayton shes a darn
attractive girl but i just wouldnt let my-
self because i knew wed never make a
success of marriage her dad owns the
morning clarion you know and of
course hes a millionaire a couple of times
over-

  marcella drayton ann sat up
why i- she stopped abruptly she
had almost said why i went to beverly
hall with marcella and that would
never have done since it certainly
wouldnt fit into the background bing had
manufactured for her instead she fin-
ished hastily ive often seen her picture
in the papers she is lovely bing
coward she told herself scathingly
why didnt you admit you went to school
with marcella and use that as an open-
ing to tell him the whole thing she
simply had to tell him but when and how
she was ever going to do it she couldnt
imagine

the next morning before she left for
the office her publisher called and told
her he was giving a cocktail party for
some of their authors

  in the green room of the hotel roth-
moor he told her and as it will be
given quite a bit of publicity superb pic-
tures eastern representative insists that
you attend theyll have photographers
there for some still shots to be used in
the advance publicity of the picture

  so its come ann thought replacing
the phone with a none too steady hand
ill have to tell him today before that
story breaks in the papers-

  but bing had already gone out on an

assignment when she arrived at the of-
fice and by lunch time he hadnt re-
turned ann could scarcely get her work
done for watching the door praying for
him to come so that she could get the
ordeal over when a little after four she
heard the clang of the elevator door and
rapid footsteps in the hall she was half
way across the big room before the door
opened

  and then with a little gasp she stopped
quite still for instead of bing it was
marcella drayton walking straight toward
her in a trim black tailored suit blue
fox furs swinging from her shoulders a
black turban with a wisp of veil on her
sculptured blonde curls ann saw that
much before she turned and fled for the
tiny cubbyhole of a rest room

  but she had scarcely closed the door
of the little room before it opened again
and marcella stood there staring at her
why ann creighton she exclaimed
what on earth are you doing here in the
clarion office and why were you try-
ing to avoid me

  hello marcella ann said weakly
i-i was hoping you hadnt recognized
me

  for heavens sake why not mar-
cellas thin brows rose

  anns mind whirled but she could think
of only one thing to do take marcella
into her confidence and ask her to keep
her secret until she had had a chance to
explain to bing

  well you see its like this she be-
gan i work here as a copy girl but
its just a sort of gag-i mean i dont
really need the job i-i just took it to
collect material for my next book its
going to be a romance with a newspaper
background handsome young reporter
hero-you know the sort of thing

  your next book marcella broke in
in a puzzled voice

  yes you see i-im lucinda low-
ry ann stammered

  well ill be damned marcella said
then her china-blue eyes narrowed but
i still dont see why you have to be so
mysterious about it even if you are a
successful novelist theres no reason why
you shouldnt work as a copy girl if you
want to come on ann give there
must be more than that to it
lovely little liar



  oh dear ann thought i didnt want
to have to tell her about bing but i sup-
pose theres nothing else for it well
there is a little more to it she admitted
somehow managing to keep her voice
light i-im in love with a man who
works on the paper and i havent told
him about myself yet of course ive
always intended to-in fact id already
decided to tell him this very afternoon
as soon as he gets back to the office
she laughed lightly so youll keep my
little secret wont you darling it would
be too awful if he learned the truth from
someone else you can see that

  marcella nodded she took a cigarette
from her bag and tapped it thoughtfully
on a lacquered red nail handsome
young reporter she murmured it
wouldnt be bing layton this man of
yours would it ann

  yes its bing ann admitted re-
luctantly remembering abruptly what bill
had told her last night that there had
been a time when he might have fallen
in love with marcella that of course
meant that marcella must know bing
rather well might even - oh awful
thought-be in love with him herself
of course i know it wont make the
slightest difference to bing that i happen
to be a successful novelist she added
firmly and wished she felt as sure as she
sounded

  oh of course not marcella said
sweetly well be sure to let me know
when the new book comes out ann i
loved fair tomorrow and with a gay
little wave of her hand she was gone

  with a sigh of relief ann went back
to work and it wasnt until half an hour
later she suddenly remembered that mar-
cella had never actually promised to keep
her secret but she shrugged the thought
impatiently away even marcella wouldnt
be cruel enough to deliberately give her
away to bing before she had a chance to
talk to him and surely he would be here
any moment now

but five oclock came and then six
and no bing

  darn that cocktail party anyway ann
thought as she jerked on her hat and
hurried out to the elevator but she had
promised so she supposed shed have to

go thank heaven the account of the
party couldnt possible make the evening
papers and she still could tell bing to-
night

  an hour later wearing a new blue vel-
veteen cocktail suit and a foolish little
hat fashioned entirely of violets she was
in the green room of the hotel roth-
moor impatient for the party to be over
so that she could leave and phone bing
to meet her some place she was scarcely
listening to the chatter of another lady
novelist who had cornered her idly her
eyes wandered over the crowd and sud-
denly she gave a strangled gasp leaving
her companion stranded in the middle of
a long description of her current heroine
she turned on her heels and began shov-
ing her way through the crowd

  what was bing doing here at a literary
cocktail party of course all the papers
were represented but by their society
editors not reporters she was almost
gasping for breath and her hat had been
knocked down over one eye by the time
she reached the first exit she had no idea
where that door led but without a mo-
ments hesitation she turned the knob
she simply had to get away before bing
saw her

  the door opened on a small writing
room and she paused for a moment to
catch her breath before trying to find her
way out and then to her dismay the
door flung open and slammed shut all
in one motion and there was bing with
his back against it his blue eyes were
practically shooting sparks and to ann
it seemed that his crisp red hair flamed
brighter than usual with his anger

 whats the hurry miss lucinda
lowry he asked with a tight-lipped
smile you wouldnt want to leave be-
fore i had a chance to say thanks for
the ride would you

  bing please- anns voice broke

  oh you neednt feel so badly about
it after all it was quite a unique experi-
ence for me i dont believe ive ever
before played the part of a guinea pig i
suppose i really should feel rather flat-
tered being chosen as the hero of lucinda
lowrys next best seller handsome
young reporter i believe was the way
marcella says you described me he
laughed mirthlessly pleitse dbrit forget


new love magazine

that i have thick curly eyelashes and-
he paused and let his eyes rest insolently
on her lips for a moment and that my
kisses pack a special brand of dynamite
that leaves even a cold-blooded lady nov-
elist a trifle breathless

  fury swept ann from head to foot
she didnt know whether that fury was
directed against marcella for twisting her
report of the conversation so cruelly or
against bing for believing marcella with-
out giving her a chance to explain

  she jerked her chin up defiantly and
the little violet hat slipped down com-
pletely over one eye she put her hands
on her hips and glared at bing from the
other eye i shall devote an entire para-
graph to your entrancing eyelashes and
possibly two to the quality of your kisses
she told him but it will undoubtedly take
me several pages to do justice to that
stubborn chin of yours and to make it
quite clear that you havent the slightest
sense of humor

  humor bing snapped i dont
happen to find this even remotely amus-
ing do you

  ann wilted with a tired gesture she
brushed the little hat to the back of her
head no she said simply as it hap-
pens i dont bing please listen-

  but bing was no longer there to lis-
ten  he had jerked the door open and
slammed it good and hard behind him
as he went out

a nn never knew how she managed
to live through those next weeks
only one idea consumed her-to see bing
and make him understand that she really
loved him that marcella had deliberately
twisted her words to give him the impres-
sion she had been using him only as story
material over and over she called the
office and his apartment only to be told
each time that mr layton is not in just
now finally with no pride left she
decided that she would go to the clarion
office and force bing to talk to her she
didnt know just how she was going to
manage it but manage it she would once
face to face with him she would talk so
fast that he wouldnt have a chance to get
away before she had had her say

  she dressed carefully for that inter-
view feeling that it wras important to look

her prettiest no use now keeping up the
pretense that she had practically no
clothes she put on a soft gold wool
frock that accented the yellow flecks in
her brown eyes and a matching gold
wool turban with a six inch swirl on top
over the yellow dress she slung a leopard
coat there she nodded admiringly at
her reflection even marcella with that
half a million dollars her grandmother
had left her couldnt look any smarter

  all the way down town in the taxi
she kept wishing she hadnt thought of
marcella today ever since that horrible
scene with bing she had been trying to
forget what he had told her the night he
asked her to marry him-that once he
might have fallen in love with marcella
desperately she wanted to believe it was
only injured pride that was keeping bing
from her that marcella herself had noth-
ing to do with it of course there had
been that picture in last nights paper of
a gay party at the glass slipper the man
on marcellas right even though his head
was partly turned had certainly looked a
little like bing and a day or two before
there had been an item in one of the gos-
sip columns

    maybe gentlemen prefer blondes but we
  know a certain luscious blonde who definite-
  ly prefers redheads these days

  youre being perfectly silly ann told
herself firmly as she walked briskly
across the lobby of the office building and
punched the elevator button new york
is full of blondes and redheads

  but a few minutes later as she stepped
from the elevator to the corridor of he
fifth floor she knew with a sick certainty
that that item had referred to bing and
marcella for there they were marcella
clinging with unmistakable possessiveness
to bings arm and bing smiling down at
her

  ann marcella squealed delightedly
im so glad we bumped into you-
theres no one id rather be the first to
hear our news bing and i are engaged
-were just come from telling dad
ill bet theres no one youd rather tell
than me ann thought bitterly while from
somewhere she conjured up a bright smile
how perfectly lovely she murmured
and couldnt resist adding now i wont
lovely little liar



have to bother to think up an ending for
my book quote love conquers all even
the scruples of our idealistic hero in
spite of the fact that he has always be-
lieved the marriage of a wealthy girl and
a comparitively poor man would be
doomed to failure he-

  youll have to change that ending a
little im afraid bing cut in stiffly i
still have my scruples as you so charm-
ingly describe them but it just happens
that marcella agrees with them-a fact i
neglected to find out until just recently
so naturally her allowance will stop
when we are married and she has prom-
ised never to accept another penny from
her father

  how sweet and generous of you dar-
ling ann glanced swiftly at marcella
no wonder she was biting her lip nerv-
ously  evidently she hadnt bothered to
tell bing about that half million her grand-
mother had left her in her own name
well this was certainly no time to pull
any punches

  i suppose she said thoughtfully
that youll donate your own fortune to
some charity or other marcella

  my fortune marcella actually man-
aged to sound utterly bewildered oh
i suppose you mean those few thousands
grandmother left me that i used to brag
about to you girls at beverly she
laughed and pouted up at bing darling
i completely forgot that but it isnt im-
portant we can decide after were mar-
ried what to do about the silly thing

  i dont suppose it seems much to
you ann sighed but half a million
would sound like a fortune to most peo-
ple

  half a million bing exploded

bing looked uncertainly from one to
the other of them but it was on
anns face that his eyes finally rested
i think youve said quite enough he
told her in a queer tight voice and he
swung marcella around and marched stiff-
ly beside her down the corridor toward
the clarion offices

  so it hadnt done any good ann
thought listlessly

  out on the sidewalk she signaled im-
patiently to taxi after taxi and when one

finally drew up at the curb she stepped
swiftly in and sank back against the seat
closing her eyes as she gave her address

  the taxi jerked forward and at the
same moment someone sat down hard on
the seat beside her

  anns eyes flew open of all the nerve
then she gasped for there sat bing
grinning that lop-sided grin at her his red
hair in wild disorder as though he had
run his hands many times through it as
he always did when excited or upset

  what-what are you doing here
in spite of her determination not to let
it anns voice shook a little

  bing shrugged his broad shoulders
oh i just decided that if i had to choose
between two lovely little liars-

  ann slapped him so hard her hand
stung i never lied to you-not really
she flared i-i tried to tell you the
truth that very first night-

  shut up you talk too much bing
interrupted gathering her into his arms
look up here and let me give you one
of those special kisses of mine

  but when it was over ann said hesi-
tantly you know nothing is really
changed bing im still a successful nov-
elist with an awful lot of money in the
bank only- she went on with a rush
i dont care about the money well just
give it away or throw it in the river or
burn it up-anything you say

  ive a much better idea than any of
those bing pulled her head down on his
shoulder well just put it in war
bonds for our grandchildren and you and
i will live on my salary i understand
uncle sam does pretty well by his cap-
tains

  captains- anns eyes flew to his
face

  i was sort of saving that for a sur-
prise for you he said my commission
just came through

  bother ann wrinkled her nose at
him now ill have to change that story
of mine again the hero will have to be
a captain in the army instead of a re-
porter but ill still let him have thick
curly eyelashes- a quick hard kiss from
bing interrupted her then she added
mischievously and kisses that pack a
special brand of dynamite

 -by ruth herbert

rusty was late and chris made up
her mouth again and saw that her
hand was shaking she was shak-
ing all over she walked up and down the
living room the skirt of her hostess gown
swirling around her slim ankles as she
looked around to be sure that everything
was absolutely perfect lamps cast soft
golden pools of light roses gleamed in
silver bowls the stage was set and it was
past the hour for the play to begin but
the red-headed leading man was late

  why did i have to fall in love with
him she thought i was happy until
i fell in love

  happy but not alive she had never
felt the lump in her throat that she
couldnt swallow or the almost unbearable
tenseness of body and mind with every
nerve quiveringly alive

  she hadnt seen him for seven days
and in the end she had had to call him
up and ask him to come tonight

  face it christy you called him the
last time too

  if she had to fall in love why couldnt
it have been with some one who loved
her  with one of the nice eligible ador-
ing young men who thought she was per-
fect just as she was why pick on a
red-headed production engineer who was
always too tired to play and who looked
at her sometimes with a puzzled waiting
sort of look in his blue eyes a man who
had never even kissed her

  sometimes she thought she would die
if he didnt kiss her sometimes she won-
dered what he would do if she were to
beg him to kiss her just once it would
have been a strange sensation for christy
carrington to beg for love-she who had
always been so popular and so proud

  her father came in he looked tired



 chris stood there long
 enough to have her
 heart cut to ribbons
life to chris ivas a stage setting for her beauty but the
if leading man was missing-because rusty wanted a girl who 
could fit herself into the life of a country at war




new love magazine

lie always looked very tired nowadays

  hello kitten youre as pretty as all
get-out expecting somebody

  rusty

  he seemed about to say something and
then he hesitated well have a good
time she noticed then that he had his
hat in his hand

  dad youre not going back to the
office i wanted to talk with you

  i wanted to ask you how to go about
making a man jail in love with me i
wanted to ask you zvhats the matter with
me zvhere ive jailed that i cant get the
only man who matters to me you ought
to know-youre a man

  some other time baby im late now

 but daddy-

  he didnt hear her he didnt see the
lost forlorn look in her dark eyes or the
way her red mouth drooped at the corners
for the first time in her life he was too
busy to bother with her

  she went back to pacing up and down
the room pretty as all get-out he had
said but that was her father-he was
prejudiced would rusty think she was
pretty 

  her hair was a shower of gold to slim
straight shoulders her honey-tanned skin
and coral mouth were something to dream
about but her most spectacular feature
were the velvet dark eyes which were such
a marked contrast to her blonde coloring

  would rusty think she was pretty  her
cheeks felt on fire but the palms of her
hands were cold and wet with anxiety in
spite of the fact she looked like a medieval
princess in her green brocade hostess
gown

  she heard the front door open and close
and he was speaking to the maid

  then he was in the living room hel-
lo christy sorry to be so late

  he looked so tired so harassed he
had been running his fingers through his
red hair until it stood up in flaming spikes
his face was haggard slashed by deep
lines at the corners of his wide mobile
mouth but his blue eyes blazed out from
his weary face

  thats all right she said lightly its
a new experience to me to do the wait-
ing

  she had been trained to talk that way
-men ate it up

he dropped down  the sofa we
finally got going on the new gadget
i was telling you about it ought to step
up production about twenty per cent after
the girls  the assembly line get used to
us but its not enough-its not enough
his eyes were wild automatically his fin-
gers began to harry his hair again the
bottleneck is on the wiring line if i could
figure out something-

  she heard the eagerness in his deep
voice eagerness that was not for her she
saw the blue fires in his eyes fires that
did not burn for her he had not even
noticed the new hostess gown she
watched the shape of his mouth a mouth
that had never lain against her own

  she had been brought up to believe that
a womans place was to soothe to placate
to entice she must take rustys mind off
his grueling day

  rusty darling why dont you forget
about the shop your work is over now
until tomorrow isnt it

  he broke off in the middle of a sen-
tence about wiring

  sorry chris what a boor you must
think me lets talk about something
pleasant but his eyes were no longer
 fire

  good christy said her voice was
very gay but she was watching his eyes
where the fires no longer burned and
her heart was suddenly frightened she
had never been afraid of boring a man
before it had always been the other way
round what shall we talk about
you thats the most pleasant topic
i know what did you do all day
there seemed to be something more
than a casual interest as he asked that
question and her heart began to beat
again

  she had slept until noon and had gone
to a benefit luncheon for the red cross
then she had served for an hour at one
of the uso centers after which she had
served for another hour at an officers
service club she made a very amusing
story out of the lieutenant who didnt want
to see any of the shows but wanted to
get into the museum of natural history

  so she told rusty about her day in a
light vein with the husky little chuckle in
her golden voice that was so enchanting
christy was noted in her crowd for the
thanks for the memory



way she told funny stories she knew it
and was accustomed to hearing her friends
say theres no one who can tell a story
like chris her dark eyes were bright
with amusement and her lovely mouth
tilted up at the corners she made the
war sound like a tea party and rusty
laughed obligingly in all the right places

  while she was talking a plane flew low
over the house so low that the sound of
its motor filled the room rusty stopped
laughing and listened his face suddenly
still his eyes naked and revealing

  that was low wasnt it  chris said
casually

  although rusty never discussed it she
knew how he felt about not being in uni-
form she realized it the day she had
taken robert graves with his brand-new
wings down to see rusty at his office
rusty had stopped work to say hello to
bob and christy had said brightly
doesnt bob look wonderful in that uni-
form it makes me proud just to walk
down the street with him 

  rusty had said quietly it should
make you proud

  bob had cut in then rather quickly
christy thought when i tangle with the
japs i hope ive got one of rustys planes
underneath me any chance fbr me to take
a look around the plant rusty

  while they were out christy said to
florence miller rustys secretary
whats the matter with rusty doesnt
he feel well

  the other girl looked almost angry
dont you know how wild he is to get
into uniform-any uniform  but hes got
courage enough to stick it out where hes
needed but its breaking his heart surely
you know that

  christys throat seemed to close up and
her heart had cried out no of course i
didnt know how could i he never
talks to me

  but he had talked to florence miller
ever since that day chris had wished
for an opportunity to tell him she didnt
mind his not being in uniform that she
loved him anyway but rusty had never
mentioned it only whenever he heard a
plane the muscles in his face tightened and
he seemed a thousand miles away

  the plane passed over and she searched
for conversation some flyers were in the

canteen today-they looked like babies
simply like infants and that was the
wrong thing to say too

  rusty said yes they like em young
and his face was too completely expres-
sionless to be real

she remembered a new joke that was
going the rounds and as she told it
rusty smiled and the far-away look went
out of his face

  then the maid came in and said there
was a miss miller to see mr heath in-
stantly rusty was on his feet

  florence came in she apologized brief-
ly to chris and immediately plunged into
conversation with rusty she looked tired
and disheveled and her lipstick was al-
most off but when rusty was talking to
her his whole face was live and intent

  christy pushed down the sick surge of
jealousy its business she told herself
firmly but there was an intimacy that was
far from businesslike she heard the con-
cern in rustys voice when he said you
did exactly right florence now you go
straight home and get a good nights
sleep she noticed that rusty put his
arm around the other girls shoulders
when he took her to the door she no-
ticed all these things and her heart was
sick within her

  when rusty came back she was re-
arranging the red roses

  theyre beautiful rusty said but
no more beautiful than you are chris-
no more fragrant no more luxurious no
more fragile

  the lamplight made a halo of her shin-
ing hair and her mouth was soft and prom-
ising as she looked up at him he put his
arms around her and the floor rocked be-
neath her he bent his high red head and
put his mouth against -hers and warmth
poured through her body drugging her
senses his kiss was long and deep and
unhurried as if he wanted to drain every
drop of sweetness as if this were not only
the first kiss but the last when that kiss
was finished christy felt as if the whole
world were holding its breath with won-
der because something she had only
dreamed about had come true

  i shall always remember tonight
rusty said softly i shall remember it
perfectly and completely


new love magazine

  christys throat was suddenly tight with
fright that sounds as if you were say-
ing thanks for the memory-as if you
never expect to see me again 

  oh i expect i shall see you now and
again rusty said his voice sounded
stirred and a little unsteady but very defi-
nite but not like tonight youre like
a dream girl christy lovely and quite
unreal you stay in your beautiful shel-
tered shell and nothing gets through to
you-not even a war

  he had started talking very quietly but
his voice kept getting more fervent

  i buy war bonds she said a little an-
grily i bought bonds instead of a new
coat i serve on committees

  i know rusty said its being done
thats what i mean

  i dont know what youre talking
about christy felt helpless frustrated
only a moment ago their lips had melted
together and now he was talking to her
as if she were a complete stranger of whom
he disapproved what are you trying to
tell me rusty-that im spoiled

  not just spoiled because spoiled peo-
ple are arrogant youre not even arro-
gant chris-theres not that much to you
youre sweet but a man needs more
than sweetness he needs understand-
ing

  the memory of his kiss still burned on
her mouth it couldnt have been a good-
bye kiss it was too throbbingly alive
chris tilted her head way back and looked
up at rusty her eyes shining her red
lips softly eagerly parted

  oh rusty lets stop arguing

  he said sharply dont try that chris
-it wont work and she felt the blood
suddenly hot in her face

  thats what i meant rustys voice
snapped now youve been brought up
to get your own way by being charming
youve been brought up to be beautiful
and useless and you want to go on being
just the way you are you dont want to
change and i doubt if you could change
even if you wanted to its not your fault
i suppose-its just the way you are

  it had started out like an indictment
but the anger suddenly left his voice and
he sounded just tired-terribly tired and
bewildered he straightened his shoul-
ders suddenly as if throwing off a bur-

den find yourself another playmate my
dear somebody who still has a taste for
milk and honey and low lights and soft
music

  inside christy felt a strange fury full
of heartbreak why did you kiss me
then

  he smiled then as if she were a slight-
ly foolish child but there was something
the matter with his smile because it did
not reach his eyes

  you were so obviously waiting to be
kissed shall i tell you a secret  i kissed
you with my fingers crossed but it was
a very heady kiss thats why once was
enough i know where to stop and when
so good-bye christy my dear-and
thanks for the memory

the front door closed softly and defi-
nitely and christy felt her heart slide
down into a bottomless pit the stars no
longer shone and the earth stood still
rusty was gone she was idle and use-
less and he didnt have time for her but
he had kissed her as if he meant it

  she wondered suddenly how he would
have felt about her if she were no longer
useless what if she worked like flo-
rence miller what if she proved to
rusty that she could hold down a job

  she was waiting up for her father when
he came in dad could you pet me a
job

  he sat down heavily as if he were
tired i dont know kitten what kind
of a job what can you do

 why i- for a moment she was
lost and a little angry at her father be-
cause he seemed to be failing her then
like an inspiration she remembered a
phrase of rustys-the girls on the assem-
bly line i want d job on an assembly
line

  his face brightened to her surprise
his tired eyes looked suddenly proud
thats very fine of you christy to want
to do something toward the war effort
it was the first time in years her father
had called her christy usually it was
kitten or baby ill see what i can
do

  id like a job in rustys plant

  did she imagine the shadow that seemed
to cross his face she must have ima-
gined it because a moment later he was
thanks for the memory



his usual self kindly and wanting to give
her what she wanted

  in rustys plant i see are you in
love with him baby

  she was completely devastatingly hon-
est i think i shall die if i cant make
him want me

  doesnt he want you

  not enough her voice was pain-
fully even but her eyes were pleading for
reassurance for hope he kissed me
once he-he seemed to like kissing me
thats important isnt it but then he
went away if he were in love with me
one kiss wouldnt be enough would it
it seemed as if he were searching for
words when times change baby peo-
ple have to change with them old stand-
ards dont count any more he stopped
hesitated ill see what i can do about
the job kitten

  he got the job for her and christy went
to work on an assembly line she had had
some vague idea of going to work in trim
fitted slacks but she wore a shapeless
blue denim coverall and hid her bright
hair under an atrocity they called a tur-
ban she sat in one back-breaking posi-
tion all day until all her muscles screamed
with pain and put two parts of a screw
together

  but she stuck to it she went home
every night and crawled into bed and it
seemed to her that she had hardly closed
her eyes before the morning alarm sound-
ed hideously in her ears but she kept at
it because sometime rusty was sure to
walk through the plant and recognize her
she dreamed of seeing his blue eyes light
up with surprise and pride and love

  and then it happened he passed by
with the foreman and christys fingers
putting screws together turned cold and
stiff her heart hammered against her ribs
until it seemed to her rusty must hear its
beating clear above the hum and whirr of
machinery then he saw her and the fire
that blazed up in his blue eyes was all
that she had dreamed about

  she got a message just before lunch
period that mr heath would like to see
her in his office when she was through
work but she didnt wait uhtil after
work she had a half-hour off for lunch
and she wasnt hungry anyway she went
to rustys office just as she was in the

voluminous ugly coverall but she snatch-
ed off her turban and let her hair tumble
down in a cascade of shimmering gold

rusty said humbly i couldnt wait
until tonight he took both her
hands and gripped them hard he said
can you ever forgive me for the things
i said can you ever-

  he choked up he just stood looking
down at her as if he were drinking her in

  triumph surged through her a high-
hearted happiness that went singing its
way through her blood i didnt put on
any lipstick she babbled because were
not allowed to wear it but then if there
isnt any lipstick on then you cant kiss
it off can you i mean you have to be
careful about things like that in an office
dont you

  he laughed a little shakily and then
he was kissing her hard fast turbulent
kisses and he hugged her so close she
could feel the hard strength of his arms
through the heavy coverall

  why didnt you tell me he whis-
pered

  she snuggled up against him i knew
youd pass by some day and see me were
you surprised  what did you think when
you saw me

  his voice was muffled in her shining
hair i thought thank god we are the
same kind of people after all

  wait till i tell daddy chris said con-
tentedly i dont think he really believed
it would work even when he got me the
job she sighed i was getting sort of
doubtful myself i began to think i would
have to stay there for months before youd
ever find out

  she felt the hard muscles of his arm
go tense

  wait a minute chris im not sure i
understand do you mean you asked your
father to get you a job here just to make
me notice you

  she should have been warned then by
the incredulous note in his voice but she
was wishing he would kiss her again
mmm   rusty whats the matter
it would have been nice rusty said
and she couldnt mistake the bitterness in
his voice if you had cared about helping
to win the war

  she tore herself out of his arms and


new love magazine

she saw that his face had gone quite gray
and his eyes were barren and defeated

  i was a fool to think you had changed
he said people dont change unless they
want to

  but rusty-

  just a trick to get me to notice you
like putting on a different kind of lip-
stick or buying a new hat you werent
used to having a man not notice you were
you christy his voice was searing
so you were afraid you would have to
stay on the job for months and i thought
we were the same kind of people why
we dont even speak the same language
she felt hot anger surging up inside of
her tying her throat in knots and with
the anger was a fierce hot pride he
didnt have to look at her with that siz-
zling contempt in his eyes he didnt have
to let his voice drip scorn when he spoke
to her if he didnt appreciate the fact that
she had half killed herself doing manual
labor just to impress him she certainly
wasnt going to call it to his attention
again what did he expect her to do go
down on her knees

  her brown eyes were on fire as she
swept her long yellow hair back from her
shoulders

  well thanks for the brush-off she
said

she found the foreman and told him
she was quitting

  all right he said brusquely pick
up your check tomorrow night

  tomorrow night im quitting now
the look in his eyes made her shiver
oh no youre not sister youll finish
your week out to give us time to put in
somebody else theres a war on-or
hadnt you heard

  how dare you use that tone to me
pardon me duchess he shrugged
well you lasted longer than most of
them thought you would at that i was
the sucker-i told them i thought youd
stick

  chris clenched her hands together at
her sides

  he turned away dismissing her all
right-thats all good-bye carrington
im sorry to lose you-you were a good
worker

  all afternoon she put screws together

all afternoon she told herself after to-
morrow i can sleep as late as i want to
i can get my hands back into condition
and get a manicure again i wonder how
longit will take to get rid of these cal-
louses

  changing her clothes in the locker room
that night she ran into mrs roberts for
weeks she had worked next to the little
gray-haired woman on the assembly line
but this was the first time she really no-
ticed her

  why arent you changing here ill
get down your things for you

  im not leaving yet mrs roberts
said smiling im working overtime to-
night

  overtime but you cant-you look
tired already christy stopped short
hesitated im sorry-maybe you need
the money

  the other woman shook her head no
i dont need the money but we ought to
get out more planes my son writes me
that our planes are better than the japs
but they still have more of them after
all they got a head start on us

  i didnt know you had a son christy
said gently where is he

  the last i heard he was in the solo-
mons mrs roberts told her well
good night miss carrington see you
tomorrow

  see you tomorrow christy echoed
but not after tomorrow

  the next day a subdued feeling of ex-
citement ran through the plant the pace
of everything seemed heightened christy
looked down the line and it seemed the
many fingers were flying faster than ever

  whats going on she asked cu-
riously

  it was mrs roberts who answered
her faded blue eyes were bright and her
thin shoulders looked unusually straight
and proud havent you heard were
getting the army-navy e flag this after-
noon 

  christy smiled politely thats fine
but it has nothing to do with me she
thought this is my last day here

  but for no reason at all her own fingers
seemed to move faster

  all the workers went to the ceremony
that afternoon they stood massed to-
gether while an official from the war
thanks for the memory



department made a five-minute speech
christy didnt hear much of it because her
eyes were riveted on a disheveled red
head she thought rusty might at least
have combed his hair

  eyes on rusty heart crying out to
rusty she thought she was not hearing
any of the speech but little snatches of it
seeped through every minute lost on
the assembly line prolongs the war one-
more frightful minute    every screw
from this factory is an integral part of a
bomber

  rustys wide shoulders were as straight
as if they were in uniform rustys blue
eyes were fixed unswervingly on the
speaker the same eyes that had blazed
with scorn as they looked down at a yel-
low-haired brown-eyed girl christy
locked her hands together to still their
shaking

  were all in it together said the
deep voice of the speaker

  on the platform the band played the
star-spangled banner unconsciously
christy felt her aching shoulders straight-
en there was a lump in her throat that
she couldnt swallow a lump that had
nothing to do with heartache or pain

  oli say does that star-spangled banner yet
      wave   

  pride could bring a lump in your throat
too

  the band stopped and the assembled
workers turned and filed out of the assem-
bly room

  is that all asked christy startled
isnt there going to be a celebration or
something

  one of the men standing near grinned
down at her a comradely grin come
on sister-weve got to get back to
work

at the end of the shift she changed
her clothes in the locker room she
put on lipstick with a lavish hand she
slipped into her beaver coat and set her
tiny beaver hat carelessly on her yellow
head tomorrow she thought eagerly ill
be able to go to the hairdresser

  she turned in her locker key and got
her check she hadnt said good-bye to
mrs roberts-somehow she couldnt but
now she felt an overwhelming desire to

say good-bye to someone after all she
had worked here for seven weeks that
should entitle her to at least a good-bye

  she smiled ravishingly at the pay-
master well good-bve

  he looked up startled he did nor
smile oh goodbye miss-er-

  carrington she said defiantly

  but he had already gone back to his
work

  she started out every step taking her
wav from rusty suddenly she couldnt
stand it suddenly she thought she would
suffocate if she couldnt get one more
glimpse of him she could at least say
good-bye to him she could be gay and
bright about it she could shake hands
and say well no hard feelings may-
be-

  she went quickly down to rustys
office

  the door was ajar and she pushed it
open quietly florence miller was there
florence miller was in rustys arms and
tears were running down her face and she
was saying in a choked little voice oh
rusty rusty i thought i could never
be so happy 

  chris stood long enough to have her
heart cut to ribbons then she turned and
ran

  a man needs more than sweetness he
needs understanding rustj had said
that had he been thinking of florence
miller 

she slept till noon the next day she
went to the hairdresser and the mani-
curist worked for an hour on her hands

  she slept till noon every day she went
to luncheons and cocktail parties and
dances men were getting scarce all the
time but there were still a few left even
if you didnt count the ones coming back
all the time on leave

  she called up don parsons who had
been crazy about her for years don
worked in a bank his draft number
hadnt come up yet when it does he
shrugged ill go of course meantime
heres to fun

  heres to fun christy echoed

  they were still having dances at the
country club once a month now instead
of every saturday night but there was a
dance the saturday night after christy


new love magazine

had quit her job and she went with don
parsons

  she wore a slinky new dress with a nar-
row skirt slit halfway up to her knees
it made her feel like a siren with her
long shining hair just barely curled under
at the ends it made her look like a little
girl trying to be sophisticated

  don thought she looked beautiful he
kept telling her so at five-minute intervals
maybe she would marry don some day
why not

 why not christy you cant go
through the rest of your life carrying a
very bright and burning torch

  coming upon rusty suddenly on the
dance floor at the club made her stop stock
still and catch her breath sharply

  why hello rusty hello florence
she stopped and introduced don and then
rattled on imagine my surprise i
didnt know you two ever prowled after
sundown i thought you were much too
grim and earnest

  she was proud of the way her voice
sounded hearing it you would never
guess that she was slowly bleeding to
death inside

  were celebrating florence said hap-
pily

  christy rushed in lets not miss a
minute of this perfectly divine music
dance with me rusty  or am i too friv-
olous for you even to dance with

  she slipped into his arms and danced
away

  that was rude but i dont care i
couldnt stand there and let her tell me
about it-i couldnt congratulate her not
yet i have to have a little time

  she knew now that she had been hop-
ing against hope right up to that last
dreadful moment when florence had said
were celebrating

  she struck out blindly wanting to hurt
rusty in some way because she was hurt-
ing so terribly herself well whats the
subject of tonights lecture going to be
professor

  he winced i deserved that i expect
im sorry i was so rude the last time i
saw you chris

  think nothing of it she said blithely
when you had nothing to lose you lost it
with a bang you snatched back your dis-
carded pride and wrapped it around you

like a cloak it makes a very funny story
-little chris getting her come-uppance
you should have heard the gang roar
about it

  i see she could almost feel the
sparks shooting from his storm-blue eyes
shall i take you back to the gang now
i dont want to deprive them of a minute
of your funny stories

  when he left her with the girl she said
well good-bye rusty darling give my
love to the little screws

  but a cloak of pride could not warm
you nothing could warm you when your
heart was like a lump of ice in your
breast

  everybody gathered around to make
much of her her friends were so glad
to see her back in circulation again tell
us about it chris was it fun

  it was wonderful she said

  she had practiced how she would tell
it i wore a size  coverall and i-
it would make such a funny story that
everybody would roar with laughter and
say chris youre priceless nobody can
tell a story like you

  tell us about it chris

  skip it she said briefly

the next saturday there wasnt a
dance but don got up a party to go
into town don knew how to push an ad-
vantage when he saw it christ wore a
long black skirt and a snug yellow sweater
that matched her hair don parsons kept
looking at her as if he could eat her up
until everybody began to laugh and tease
them about it

  why shouldnt i look at her don
said unabashed shes like something
out of this world

  youre like a drearn-girl christy-love-
ly and quite unreal

  suddenly christy was trembling im
tired of this place lets do something
different lets go to a newsreel

  the others let up a howl of protest
but don said fatuously ill take you to
a newsreel christy

  he held her hand in the movie chris
youve got a callous on those lovely soft
hands

  of course ive got callouses you cant
have bombers without callouses

  aloud she said lightly callouses are
thanks for the memory



nothing you should have seen them when
they were blisters

  one of the pictures showed a flight of
american four-motored bombers

  don she said suddenly maybe
some of my screws are in those bombers
he laughed christy youre cute
hes silly christy thought he just
doesnt know what its all about hes
all right to play around with in peace-
time but he doesnt know theres a war
going on

  and then something flashed on the
screen that caught her attention-the pre-
sentation of the army-navy e award
to rustys plant they didnt show much
of the ceremony just a brief glimpse of
the speakers platform a briefer glimpse
of the massed workers then the band
played the star-spangled banner and the
audience rose

  christy stood so still she seemed hardly
to breathe her throat was tight

  were all in it together   my son
says we havent enough planes where
is your son mrs roberts the last i
heard he ivas in the solomons    not
enough planes    sorry to lose you
carrington you were a good worker   
oh say does that star spangled banner
yet wave    were all in it togeth-
er it would have been nice christy
if you had tianted to help win the war 
don christy said lets go home i
have to get up early in the morning

the next morning she went out to the
bomber plant and asked the foreman
if she could have her job back

  he said briefly sorry carrington we
have to have people we can depend on
all right christy said humbly i
dont blame you

  it took a long time for her to find a job
in another plant it was hard walking in
cold and applying for a job different from
having her father make all the arrange-
ments beforehand and she was afraid to
give her last place as reference but more
ashamed not to maybe the foreman
wouldnt recommend her

  the day she was finally hired she went
home with her brown eyes shining like
stars

  she had never seen such pride in any-
bodys face as her fathers when she told

him he cleared his throat several times
before he spoke so youve grown up
have you kitten

  she said im going to take a course
at night in reading blueprints the fore-
man says they cant get enough women
who can read blueprints

  it was rather an oblique reply to his
question but her father seemed satisfied

  the assembly lines at the new plant
didnt work as fast as those at rustys it
worried christy it wasnt anything you
could put your finger on but there just
wasnt the same urgency about getting the
work out the harassed foremen worried
and prodded once christy heard brodie
the big foreman of her own shift swear-
ing under his breath that you couldnt ex-
pect to get any work out of women any-
way

  christy hardly knew when she began
to talk maybe it started in the locker
room or at lunch period but somehow or
other a little shyly at first she began tell-
ing about mrs roberts pretty soon
everybody on the line knew about mrs
roberts who was middle-aged and tired
but who worked overtime because her son
was in the solomons then christy be-
gan telling about the army-navy e flag
she said casually we ought to get it
here too

  as the weeks went by she learned the
names of all the girls in her department
she knew violet whose feet hurt and
katherine whose boy-friend was in the
marines and penny who had a phi beta
kappa key from wellesley after a while
no matter where she went in the plant
somebody was apt to say hi chris we
moved up seven per cent this week may-
be we will get that flag

  one day brodie passed her and said
keep going sister youve got what it
takes 

  chris felt as if she had been knighted
she tried not to think of rusty some-
times she would go for almost five min-
utes at a time without thinking of him
once then she would tell herself with a
wry smile keep going sister at this
rate youll get over him by the time youre
ninety

  sometimes she would pass a workman
with red hair or a foreman who carried
his wide shoulders with a slight swagger


new love magazine

and her knees would turn to water and
the ache of loneliness inside her would be
almost more than she could stand then
she would go and tell one of the new girls
about the e flag

  and then miraculously the news came
the company was to receive the army-
navy award christy thought she had
never in her life been so proud as she
was on that friday afternoon at four
oclock

  she was way back in the middle of the
crowd and she couldnt see very much of
the platform but she heard the president
of the company say that today they had
as honored guest the production engineer
of the bomber plant for whom they were
sub-contractors-mr russell iieath

  christy caught her breath wildly and
lost track of what followed when she
finally fought back to where she could
breathe again the principal speaker was
already nearly finished but she heard him
say that in the last three months produc-
tion had gone up twenty-seven per cent
and she almost burst with pride

  and then he said we thought it would
be a good idea to have one of the workers
come up here today to receive the flag
so we asked the foremen to designate
some one to represent the men and then
we got a little bit of a surprise it seems
that the unanimous choice was a girl and
what we heard from those twenty-four
hard-boiled foremen makes us proud to
accept their recommendation will miss
christine carrington please come up to
the platform

  oh no chris whispered frantically

  she turned to flee

  it was brodie big gruff brodie who
took her arm and led her through the
grinning applauding crowd

  christy accepted the flag with shaking
fingers she managed a frightened little
half-smile for the smiling officials she
opened her mouth and not a sound
emerged finally she managed a squeaky
thank you but it seemed to be enough
the crowd roared their approval and the
band played the star spangled banner
then the officials on the platform gath-
ered round to shake hands with christy
she thought now its coming if i can
get through the next five minutes ill be
all right

  she said how do you do mr col-
lins  how do you do colonel for-
rest    how do you do mr heath

  hello chris rusty said

  dont look at him christy and maybe
you zvont give yourself away

  the president of the company was pat-
ting her shoulder paternally mr heath
tells me you two are old friends sup-
pose you run along with him now and
renew old acquaintance

  i cant christy said ive got to
get back to work

   cant ive stood enough for one day
he zvants to apologise so hell feel better
and can go back to florence with me off
his conscience

  nonsense laughed the president
ill tell brodie you had special dispen-
sation take her down to my office heath
-you know the way

and then she was walking down the
hall with rusty

  they went into the big private office
and chris sat down not saying anything
rusty didnt seem to know how to begin
either the silence became thick and em-
barrassing finally for something to do
she took off her turban and ran her fin-
gers through her hair

  then she heard rustys quick indrawn
breath

  youve cut your hair he said stupid-
ly his voice shook a little

  it got in my way chris said briefly
then she flung back her head and looked
straight at him she was thinner than
when he had last seen her prouder there
were smudges of pallor under her cheek-
bones her wide-set dusky eyes were
dangerously bright her voice dangerously
soft after the war she said clearly
i shall let it grow again clear down to
my shoulders after the war

  of course his voice was still un-
even but its lovely that way too like
little soft baby curls close to your head

  to her horror she felt her eyes sting
and two scalding tears crawled down her
cheeks

  rusty spoke again helplessly i know
you didnt want to come down here with
me i hadnt any right to force it on you
but i had so many things to say and now
i cant even think how to begin
thanks for the memory



  she stood there willing the tears to
stop but they kept coming

  then rusty said maybe this is a bet-
ter way than talking he leaned over
and put his mouth against hers he left
it there for a long moment and christy
felt the same old response to his touch
but the mouth he kissed remained cold

  she drew away from him she could
have stood almost anything except hav-
ing him kiss her in pity because she cried

  out of her pain and her humiliation she
found words to say maybe i can help
you

  get it over with before he sees it in
your eyes and hears it in your voice

  you want to say youre sorry dont
you rusty you want to apologize for
the things you said the last time i was in
an office with you but you dont have to
apologize because all you said was true
except one thing people can change
people can grow up only i was just a
little late getting around to it now lets
skip it shall we how is florence

  he sounded startled and utterly be-
wildered by her abrupt change of sub-
ject florence shes fine now her
husband got back a week ago hes in
the hospital but hes going to be all right

  her husband

  why yes didnt you know she was
married well her husband was in the
pacific and was reported missing for a
long time florence kept up kept on
working but when she got word he had
been found she went all to pieces i re-

the

member the exact day she heard because
it was the day we got the e flag at the
plant i thought she told you that night
we saw you at the country club she said
we were celebrating

   i remember christy whispered oh 
 rusty-i thought you were in love with
 her

  he went white under his tan how
could i be in love with her

   she saw it in his eyes she heard it in
 his voice light spilled over christys face
 oh she said i dont know darling-
 because im in love with you

  she hugged the words to her heart
happiness brimmed up in her eyes and
spilled over are your fingers still
crossed darling

  he reached out and gathered her in
she could feel the starved pounding of
his heart against hers she could feel the
tenderness of his hands and the hard pos-
sessiveness of his mouth on hers

   he was still kissing her when a flight
 of planes passed overhead rusty lifted
 his head to listen but this time he wasnt
 far away-he had let her in he said i
 wish i were flying one of those he said
 it with longing but almost casually as if
 he knew shed understand

   she didnt have to say all the things
shed practiced after all you didnt need
a lot of words when two people spoke
the same language

  i know darling christy said i
know how you feel

g

erry was sitting at the big ma-
hogany desk in the inner sanctum
ella eatons private office the
door stood open so that she could see into
the small outer office
troubles inc



               ella eaton
               troubles inc

  those were the puzzling words on the
outside door

  what have people got more of than
anything else in the world ella would
say troubles and this city is full of
them hundreds of girls on their own
getting into jams and nobody to talk
things over with

  she had been right in three months
the business had grown astonishingly
they were already looking for another
girl to help with the mail and the schedule
was full of private consultations every
day

  ella was a modish comfortably stout
woman with handsome gray hair kindly
humorous eyes and a firm mouth and chin
she was no quack she had the proper
doctors and psychiatrists behind her but
all most people needed was common or-
dinary horse-sense advice

  two hours ago ella had sat at this desk
and received a telephone call she had
hung up and barked gerry

  she was thrusting letters into a brief-
case even before gerry could get into the
room my aunts very ill and ive got
to go to new england i dont know how
long ill be gone youll have to take
over

  but im just your secretary gerry
wailed

  ive got a train to catch i havent
time to argue ella said jamming on
her hat ill keep in touch with you
good-bye and she was gone

  well nobody had come in for two
hours the people who had called on the
phone had been quite willing to wait for
miss eatons return

  gerry had done all sorts of things on
this job from simply answering mail-to
shopping for new clothes and hairdos for
the girls she adored it but she didnt
feel qualified to juggle another persons
life around

  five to five she breathed a sigh of re-
lief and uncrossed her fingers that was
the wrong thing to do because at that
very moment the outer door was flung
open by a distracted-looking girl a very
pretty girl with curly blond hair and wide
blue eyes

  gerry straightened up fortunately

she had kept her spectacles on she felt
they made her more impressive

  miss eaton the girl asked her high
heels clipping sharply across the floor

  miss eaton is out of town gerry
said im miss palmer her assistant
oh how awful the girl said she
lit a cigarette and began to pace up and
down in front of the desk ive got to
decide tonight she turned quickly can
you help me

  i can try was the quiet answer
gerry took out a card and filled it in
the girls name was sylvia mead she
was nineteen she lived on east thirty-
fifth street she was a photographers
model

  i cant stand it any more she said
i cant sleep

  two men are in love with me and i
cant make up my mind ones rich and
ones poor i dont know as i could stand
being poor ive always wanted to be rich
poverty kills love anyway doesnt it
is the rich one older gerry asked
oh a lot older the girl said

  gerry felt a flood of relief this one
was easy just routine stuff she knew
ellas answer always tell them to marry
the one they love that was the young
poor one if they werent really in love
with the young poor one there wouldnt
be any problem

  gerry talked quietly for a few minutes
the girl said but are you sure im not
in love with bruce the rich one

  gerry talked again about the glamor
of money which had nothing to do with
love besides she said what if this
other man is poor hes young hell
probably make money especially with
your love and help

  when sylvia mead left she seemed
satisfied and gerry felt quite proud of
herself

  she fluffed out her brown hair put on
her small leopard pillbox which matched
the collar of her black suit it was a very
good suit an extravagance considering
her small salary but it was important to
look well and some day ella would be
able to give her a substantial raise

a fter a merciless ride on the subway
she stopped in at the corner grocery
store she wanted a nice juicy steak for


new love magazine

two jimmy loved steak but steak was
much too high and really very scarce these
days so she compromised on some
ground beef for hamburgers

  she carried her bundles from the store
and climbed up the three steep flights to
her tiny apartment she was quite out
of breath when she let herself in and
dumped her packages on the table

  there was no time to freshen her face
or start the dinner before jimmy was
ringing the door bell

  he was a tall dark nice-looking young
man in a cheap but neatly-pressed blue
serge suit he was just her own age-
twenty-five he kissed her but he looked
cross he had been deferred by his draft
board because he had to support his
mother sometimes she wondered if the
fact that he wasnt in uniform was the
reason for his occasional bad disposition
but lately she was beginning to wonder
he was always cross before dinner and
tonight it irritated her more than usual
she was just as tired and hungry as he
was whats more she had to hustle
around and get the meal she couldnt sit
back in a comfortable chair and read the
evening paper

  whats the matter with me anyway
she thought dont i love jimmy after
all

  lets go to the movies she said as
she peeled the potatoes

  okay jimmy mumbled over the top
of his paper

  did you get to talk to the boss today
she asked

  what jimmy said crossly

  did you talk to mr hemstreet about
giving you holtons job when he leaves

  jimmy put the paper aside and got up
he thrust his hands into his pockets and
began to pace up and down theyve
sent for the chicago man to take holtons
place he said at last

  she couldnt say anything she felt sick
with disappointment theyd never be
able to get married he might just as
well be in the army as far as matrimony
was concerned

  darn it jimmy said here i am
earning twenty-five measly bucks a week
hows a man ever to get ahead in this
lousy world

  if youd only asked him right away

two weeks ago as i wanted you to she
said and knew instantly that it was the
wrong thing to say

  he said furiously i guess i know my
own business better than you do

  lets not talk about it now she sug-
gested

  lets not talk about it ever he
growled

  they climbed the long stairs up to the
balcony because the seats were so much
cheaper and sat through two dull movies
they climbed down again and walked
home and up the three flights to her apart-
ment it was late so jimmy just kissed
her good night in the hall it used not to
be like this when we were first engaged
she thought

  i dont know she said to herself
later just as she was about to drop off to
sleep the rich one might have been
awfully nice to have

there were quite a few letters to an-
swer in the morning and many tele-
phone calls but no one came in until
abnost noon then a blond young man
stormed in like a cyclone her first im-
pression was a tall well built form in a
smooth-fitting uniform then she noticed
the silver bar on each shoulder and the
wings over his heart

  i want to see miss eaton he de-
manded leaning across gerrys desk
threateningly

  miss eaton is out of town she said

  who are you

  i am miss palmer miss eatons as-
sistant she said stiffly is there any-
thing i can do for you

  then it was you he exploded

  gerry drew back startled he looked
ready to throttle her obviously he was
crazy she wondered if screaming would
bring help in time

  youve ruined my life thats what
youve done he cried

  what do you mean by butting in and
telling her to marry that bloke what
business is it of yours i love her do
you understand youve ruined my life
and im going to sue for damages
and you neednt think i wont

  gerrys head was whirling im-
afraid i dont understand she mur-
mured
troubles inc



  im afraid you dont he snapped
you couldnt understand the simplest
human problem except how to mess up
other peoples lives for some miserable
little fee now what i want to know is
what you are going to do about it

  she just stared at him helplessly

  in another week i could have per-
suaded her he stormed im going to
marry sylvia mead whether you like it
or not whats more youre going to help
me youre going to see her again and
take back that lousy advice

  sylvia mead things were beginning
to be a little clearer then this was the
rich older man he couldnt have been
more than thirty perhaps that looked old
to the nineteen-year-old sylvia in love
with someone else but any girl in her
right mind could see that this man was
young strong handsome-and definitely
virile very definitely

  she frowned and picked up a pencil
and tapped it on the desk lets talk this
over calmly she said it seemed ob-
vious to me that you werent the one
miss mead was in love with

  oh it seemed obvious to you did it
well it never seemed very obvious to
me she didnt seem to hate my kisses
gerry was startled to find herself not
liking at all the idea of his kissing sylvia
mead she said angrily it was just your
money

  are you trying to tell me that i am so
repulsive that a girl would only put up
with my kisses on account of my money
gerry felt her cheeks growing hot i
didnt mean that at all but i cant talk
to you unless you calm down

  calm down he exploded when
youve ruined my life all right youre
not going to talk to me youre going to
talk to sylvia ill be back here at five
oclock and pick you up youre going to
march straight to sylvias with me and tell
her everything you said was a mistake
and youd better not try to get out of it
because ill find you-anywhere

  he slammed out of the door and gerry
slumped back in her chair this would
happen to her with ella away

  would he sue could he sue could
he swamp troubles inc in a lot of un-
favorable publicity and wreck ellas be-
loved business

  but that was sheer nonsense he was
in the army just the same she had bet-
ter do her best to straighten things out

  at four-thirty she got up from her desk
and did a thorough repair job on her face
she peered at herself critically and won-
dered if a man would find her as pretty
as sylvia mead sylvia was the doll-
baby type gerrys smoky gray eyes were
level and candid her coral lips had a
humorous quirk at the corners and her
hair was just light brown

  no she decided with a sigh a man
wouldnt look at her with sylvia around

she began to feel very jittery as the
hands of the clock moved toward five
he wont come she kept assuring herself
and she felt just as scared that he
wouldnt come as that he would

  then the door was thrust open and
there he was

  im here he announced scowling
so you didnt try to run away

  i am not a fugitive from justice she
said haughtily lieutenant-

  cowell bruce cowell

  lieutenant cowell you feel that an in-
justice has been done and i am more than
willing to investigate

  to her surprise he grinned his blue
eyes crinkling at the corners okay
he said well declare an armistice
weve got three hours to waste sylvia
wont be home until after eight and im
not going to let you out of my sight
youve got to get my girl back for me-
tonight after all im in the army and
orders for foreign service will be coming
up anyday now

  three hours

  well have cocktails and dinner
  but-

  there were no buts with this young
man he had her by the arm and was
leading her out of the door he put her
into a taxi and gerry peering out at the
crowds shoving into the subway entrance
felt very superior

  the restaurant he chose was one of the
very smartest soft lights glowing and
soft music playing they took a booth at
the side of the room and bruce ordered
champagne cocktails she had never had
a champagne cocktail jimmy always
bought beer


new love magazine

  he lifted his glass well heres to
your success-in persuading sylvia in my
favor he said

  gerry looked at him you love her
very much dont you

  one look at sylvia and any mans a
goner he said

  gerry felt irritated to think that even a
strong sure man like bruce cowell would
fall for that baby-face men were saps
about women

  sylvias like a soft purry kitten he
said when she curls up in your
arms-

  the picture of sylvia in his arms made
her furious she wanted to throw some-
thing at him it was such an unreason-
able emotion that she wondered what was
the matter with her and there was some-
thing else that bothered her too he said
he might be ordered into foreign service
that might mean africa australia or
someplace far away someplace where he
would be in constant danger

  how come he said suddenly that
you got this job messinginto other peo-
ples lives let em make their own mis-
takes id like to see anyone tell me what
to do

  i dont suppose anybody could tell
you anything she murmured but mod-
ern life can be very confusing especially
to girls who live alone why shouldnt
they profit by miss eatons wisdom and
experience

  and you think your precious miss
eaton has all the answers to happiness
she has all the answers for good sense
which goes a long way toward happiness
he smiled with amusement i suppose
youve got your life all down pat he
reached across the table and caught her
left hand looked down at jimmys signet
ring is that an engagement ring

  it is she said coolly until we can
afford a real one

  so youre engaged he must be a
paragon among men he said mockingly
why do you say that

  well you dont think im attractive
enough for a girl to want to marry and
actually im way above average

  certainly in conceit anyway she said
he just grinned at her ive got an
idea he said lets go some place
where we can dance

they danced while they were waiting
for their dinner bruce was a won-
derful dancer it seemed to gerry that
they were simply marvelous together she
just fitted into his arms she bet that
sylvia mead was too short for him she
was three inches taller than sylvia

  he was very polite and agreeable a
perfect host but he didnt seem to he
aware of her as a woman

  this annoyed her she didnt want him
to be so detached she was falling for the
glamor of his money of course she could
sympathize with sylvia mead no wonder
she was in a state of confusion deciding
between this man and one who didnt have
as much as he had

  a few minutes past eight he glanced at
his watch they were just finishing their
coffee wed better get going he said
and she realized he hadnt forgotten syl-
via for one moment

  they took a taxi to east thirty-fifth
street and sylvia opened the door look-
ing like dresden china in a blue taffeta
house coat

  why miss palmer she said her
eyes widening in astonishment when she
saw gerry i didnt know he was bring-
ing you

  miss palmer feels that she was a little
hasty in her advice bruce said she
has decided to have another talk with
you

  he took gerrys arm and led her firmly
into the room

  a dark and handsome young ensign a
very young man not more than twenty-
two rose out of a chair and glared at
bruce

  sylvias said she was going to marry
me he began furiously will you get
that through your head cowell and get
out of here before i have to throw you
out

  goodness gerry thought another
young man with a violent temper

  sylvia said now dick darling
please she gave a deep sigh and turned
to gerry we could be alone in the bed-
room she said

  gerry followed her into the bedroom
wondering if it was safe to leave those
two young men together she couldnt
think of anything to say to sylvia she
suddenly felt very foolish
troubles inc

  what am i going to do miss pal-
mer the girl wailed when you told
me yesterday that i was really in love
with dick i was so relieved i thought i
wouldnt really mind being poor at all-
after the war wed be so happy because
we loved each other then when i told
bruce he was so violent about it it was
positively thrilling i cant bear to give
either of them up and both of them might
be ordered into foreign service any day
gerry said i think wed better wait
until miss eaton comes back this just
might be one of those cases where shed
say not to marry either of them

  what cried sylvia looking startled
you mean she might tell me not to marry
dick

  i dont know gerry said but
shell be back in a couple of days and
shell know so much better than i would

that wasnt exactly true gerry knew
what ellas answer would be she
knew it with an awful cold certainty syl-
via found bruce cowell thrilling she was
in love with him ella would tell her to

marry him gerry herself could have told
sylvia right that moment but somehow
she couldnt get the words out she
couldnt tell sylvia to marry bruce the
thought of their being married-

  she pulled herself up sharply she re-
peated thats the best thing to do--wait
for miss eaton

  sylvia opened the door to the living
room she announced to the two men who
stood waiting ive decided to wait for
miss eatons return before making my
decision

  dick exploded youre going to give
me an answer yes or no tomorrow or
youll never see me again pie grabbed
up his hat and slammed out of the door

  sylvia stared at the closed door and
suddenly burst into tears oh bruce
she sobbed and went into his arms for
comfort bruce held her and patted her
shoulder

  gerry stood on one foot and then the
other feeling embarrassed and miserably
alone she finally said weakly well
ill be going and she rushed out

  as she ran down the stairs she asked

 herself furiously now what have i got
 to cry about

   she was just at the corner when bruce
 caught up with her you got away aw-
 fully quick he said the least i can do
 is take you home

   she said you stay with sylvia
 sylvias all wrought-up shes better
 off alone he took her arm and put her
 in a taxi asking her address

   sinking down on the seat beside her
 he said well you didnt do so well for
 me either were back where we started
 miss eaton will tell her to marry you
 im sure of that i can see i made a mis-
 take she stared out of the window

   did you he said look he said
 suddenly would you do me a favor
 yes

   you wont get mad

   why should i

   she turned to look at him he had
 moved close to her his face was very
 close and very intent she knew he was
 going to kiss her and that she ought to
 stop him but somehow she was powerless
 she could not take her eyes away from
 his

   then his arms pulled her close and he
 kissed her hard for one sweet terrifying
 moment she pressed closer to him while
 everything inside of her seemed to be
 melting away in a giddy hungry ecstasy
 then he let her go her heart was pound-
 ing wildly she was trembling and her
 cheeks were on fire

   she said feebly inanely how-how
 dare you

   you said you wouldnt be mad he
 turned her face so that she had to look into
 his eyes will you please tell me is the
 thrill you got from that kiss because of
 my bank account-or because i am a
 man

   she pushed away from him hard who
 said it was a thrill

   oh a man can always tell he said
 carelessly

   well youre not so smart as you
 think it didnt mean anything-anything
 at all to me but i suppose it would to
 a girl who loved you this is my house
 the taxi had stopped and she was out
 of the door before he could even move to
 open it for her he ran up the steps after
troubles inc

 her and firmly took her key from her and
 opened the door

   lieutenant cowell she said haught-
 ily our business is over now im sure
 miss eaton will tell sylvia to marry you
 but i dont want a girl who has to be
 told to marry me i want a girl who loves
 me so much she cant help herself

   then keep kissing her the way you
 just kissed me gerry snapped and
 maybe shell marry you before miss eaton
 gets back

   oh he said brightly is that the way
 you felt about the kiss

   i didnt say  felt any way about it i
 said she might

   she slammed the door in his face she
 was out of breath and shaking as she
 reached her own apartment and there
 stood jimmy

 heavens she had forgotten all about
 him and the dinner she cooked for him
 every night he was looking very injured
 you might have called me he said
 dont tell me you havent eaten

   of course i havent

   honestly jimmy you might have the
 sense to eat when im delayed on busi-
 ness she flung her hat down on a chair

   business he said lifting his brows
 a bit i know you drove up with a man
 -an army officer i suppose the uniform
 got you

   she said coldly well it still happens
 to have been business uniform or no uni-
 form oh jimmy she said suddenly
 flinging herself into his arms lets be
 like we used to be lets not have every-
 thing dead and dull between us like this
 i guess i do seem pretty dull he said
 bitterly beside a man who can ride you
 around in taxis

   his words struck home there it was
 again the glamor of money versus the
 glamor of love

 the next morning she couldnt seem
 to put her mind on her work there
 were a lot of letters to answer but she
 didnt seem to know the answers to any-
 thing ella phoned long distance and said
 that she would be back in the morning

  gerry hung up the phone and gazed
 across the room tomorrow ella would
 be back to tell sylvia to marry lieutenant
 bruce cowell she wondered if bruce had

new love magazine

gone back to the baby doll last night she
wondered if he had taken her advice and
kissed her

  the telephone rang

  hello said bruces voice very cheer-
fully he had kissed sylvia then he had
persuaded her gerry closed her eyes
against the aching pain she felt

  im taking you out to dinner tonight
he announced

  but she said i told you i wasnt
going to have anything more to do with
this business

  who said i was taking you out for
business im taking you out because
i want to he hung up

  she stared at the phone and then she
put it down slowly she was feeling so
giddy that she had to catch hold of the
desk he was taking her out because he
wanted to she didnt understand it

  she understood it perfectly half an hour
later when sylvia mead called her

  i thought youd want to know syl-
via said excitedly dick and i are leaving
for maryland to be married tonight he
has his orders and there are only two
days left i couldnt bear losing dick
you were right all the time hes the one
i really love

  so that was the reason bruce wanted to
see her he had lost sylvia he wanted
to bawl her out again

  she was ready when he came at five
hello beautiful he said grinning
he took her hands

  she snatched them away from him
you must think im awfully dumb she
said or else you dont think i know
about your losing sylvia

  losing sylvia he sat down on the
edge of the desk and looked at her

  she called me about driving to mary-
land with dick tonight to marry him
to marry him

  she may have left a message for me
at the office but i wasnt in all afternoon
he didnt seem in the least disturbed
dont you-mind bruce

  he caught her hands and pulled her
over in front of him

  all i ever cared about sylvia he
said was the competition its always
a challenge to me last night the minute
she opened that door and i saw her be-
side you-why she was suddenly nothing

only 

 but a cute little kid to me there are
 dozens of them around but you gerry
 -there is only one you 

  her heart was beating hard you-
 seemed to like kissing her

   she was fun to kiss what pretty girl
 isnt he demanded grinning im only
 human but kissing her was like kissing
 a kitten and kissing you gerry is like
 kissing a woman a warm alive thrill-
 ing woman he drew her closer to him
 i couldnt ever get enough of kissing
 you gerry he said huskily if you
 want to know the truth i never kissed
 sylvia the way i kissed you last night
 he suddenly lifted her left hand he
 drew off jimmys ring and he reached
 back for her bag which was lying on the
 desk opened it and dropped the ring in-
 side you can give that back to him
 later he said calmly

   she snatched the bag from him give
 me that ring she said im engaged to
 jimmy i love him

   do you he said his eyes searched
 hers were going to change your mind
 about that

   she thought he was going to kiss her
 but he didnt it was a sharp disappoint-
 ment

   come on he said were going to
 have an evening

   they certainly had an evening gerry
 iiad never been in so many famous places
 she had never had such an exciting time
 with any man but she held steadily to
 the thought that she had never had so
 much money spent on her before could
 she trust the thrill she felt when bruce
 looked at her and smiled into her eyes
 she wasnt going to let herself be carried
 away by a mans money

   he didnt kiss her good night either
 although she held her face up to him ex-
 pectantly his fingers suddenly gripped
 ler shoulder hard gerry if you dont
 ove me i dont want to kiss you again
 the less i have to remember the better
 he turned away abruptly and went
 down the stairs

gerry went into her apartment
dropped her coat and hat on a chair
she thought i love jimmy i must love
jimmy weve been engaged a year i
cant have changed so suddenly its just

the glamor of the money it was true about
sylvia and it must be true about me

she decided to write a letter to ella

she wrote steadily for ten minutes
signed a fictitious name and address

    in the morning she took the letter
 along with several others into ella its
 certainly nice to have you back she said
 that one on the top seems sort of-
 urgent i wish voud look at it

all right ill look at it ella said

    she knew what ellas answer would be
 she knew she was going to have to tell
 bruce no ellas advice was always right

    it was almost noon when ella called
 her in i made some notes on that let-
 ter she said you can put them into
 the answer

    gerrys mouth felt very dry all-
 right she said she took the notes and
 folded them and went back to her desk

     she couldnt bring herself to read them
 she couldnt theyd be so-final she

walked into the restaurant at one to meet
bruce her heart was beating very hard

  then she saw his face coming toward
her and she knew she couldnt say no she
knew that all the good sensible advice in
the world wasnt going to keep her from
marrying him it might be just the money
but she simply couldnt give him up

  he seemed to know it the minute he
looked into her eyes he said gerry
huskily and right there in front of every-
body he took her into his arms and kissed
her

  a little while later they sat at a small
table against the wall they were holding
hands across the table and not paying
much attention to their food

  gerry laughed suddenly youll be
glad to know she said that youre get-
ting a girl who loves you so much shes
going against everybodys advice

  did miss eaton advise you against
me he said

  she opened her bag and handed him
the notes he scanned them quickly and
then he chuckled im afraid ive been
all wrong about your miss eaton he
said didnt you read these

  she shook her head it didnt matter
what anybody told me to do bruce

  he handed her the notes read them
why this girl is so muddled up i dont
understand ella had written shes
suffering from a guilty conscience about
this man shes been engaged to for so long
everything she writes about him shows
him up to be one horrible weakling the
other man appears to be strong and con-
fident whats his money got to do with
it tell her to marry him and count her
blessings

  gerry lifted her eyes and looked at
bruce but bruce she always tells them
to marry the poor man thats just
routine stuff

  not unless theyre in love with him it
seems why were you so sure shed tell
sylvia to marry me

  gerry hesitated well i guess even
then i was sure that you were the right
mafi for anybody to marry

  oh no he said not anybody just
you darling
