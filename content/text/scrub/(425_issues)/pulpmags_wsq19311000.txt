these nationally-known educators pass upon the scientific principles of all stories

prophetic fiction is the mother of scientific fact

wanted acre plot

in this issue of the quarterly you will find
the first two stories resulting from the inter-
planetary plot contest announced several
months ago

   these as well as the stories to appear in suc-
ceeding issues which were prize winners in the
interplanetary plot contest will be found in
our opinion to have most excellent plots the
contest has brought into life stories which oth-
erwise might never have seen the light of day

  we firmly believe
that this contest has
been the means to stir
up something entirely
new in science fiction
literature and to ad-
vance the art of science
fiction so impressed
have we been with the
results of the contest
that we have deter-
mined to make it a per-
manent part of this
magazine

  there is no good
reason why you as a
reader should not have
as good ideas for inter-
planetary plots as any
author as a matter of fact the average man
who is not an author looks upon science fiction
through a different sort of mental glasses he has
more perspective for that reason there is
usually an originality and freshness in readers
ideas that often are unmatched by the best of
our authors

it has therefore been decided to make a stand-
ing offer of  for any plot acceptable to the
editorial board prize to be paid upon publication

next

of the story the point we wish to stress now
particularly is that the plot must be original
and must not have been used before in the last
contest a great many plots did not win prizes
because they contained too many ideas along the
following lines

   	they dealt only with interplanetary wars

   	they dealt with strange but unplausible
interplanetary beasts

                     	they showed
 our hero going to an-
other planet simply to
rescue a fair princess
from an evil high
priest

  	they showed
our explorers going
clear out of the solar
system t o another
world and finding peo-
ple just like ourselves

  therefore if you
hope to have your plot
accepted steer clear
of those hackneyed and
unrealistic ideas

we will pay the uni-
form prize of 
for each accepted plot this offer will hold for
an entire year from the date of this publication
and may be extended by the publishers if satis-
factory results have been received

   for other details regarding the plots we refer
you to the spring  issue of wonder stor-
ies quarterly volume  no  should
you not have a copy of this magazine we shall be

lad to send you printed matter relating to the
etails of the contest

  wonder stories quarterly will for
 the next year pay  for each interplane-
 tary plot suggested by our readers that we
 accept this contest is meant for our readers
 only and professional authors are barred from
 it  will be paid to the winner upon pub-
 lication of the story

   inamuch as the plot will be handed to one of
 our regular authors who will write the story
 the winning story will therefore be signed
 jointly by the reader-author and the profes-
 sional author who will use the plot as a basis
 for the story

  the cosmic cloud

by bruno h burgel

jiiulrafon by paul	

only hunting and nomad people could sustain life there northern cities of once great im-
portance were deserted the population streamed southward


the cosmic cloud

translated by konrad schmidt and fletcher pratt

bruno h burgel

w

the vast field of snow interrupted here and
there by sharp spicules of ice glared brilliant-
ly under the morning sun a peculiar yellow-
brown umbra surrounded the star of day whose
first rays imparted a pinkish hue to the scene mak-
ing blots of contrasting color where light and sha-
dow met

  at the crest of an icy hum-
mock stood two men who con-
templated the fairy-like scene
through powerful field-glasses
turning this way and that to look
across the frozen ocean

  at a considerable distance a
small detachment of mounted
police had halted in accordance
with orders from the united
states of europe they remained
modestly in the background
their mission was to watch over
the safety of the pair and only
to intervene in case a sudden ice-
crack brought the explorers into
danger

  the commander of the little
troop was soothing his horse
which evidently had some ob-
jection to standing
on the icy surface

he patted the neck
of the small brown
animal and felt in
his pocket for a
piece of sugar he
too would have liked
to follow the ex-
plorers to the crest
of their hill for a
closer inspection of
he remarkable air-
ship that stood just
beyond

  he had been in-
formed that they
were commissioners
from the powerful
nation of the torrid
zone high officials
of the united states
of africa many
things hung on the
report they would
transmit to their
home government

  what had become
of the old continent
of europe once so
dominant through
the world the
great catastrophe
had but thrown her
into the shadow in

the truest sense of the word the sun had lost its
power the ice-age had gripped the whole north-
ern hemisphere

  one of the gentlemen on the hill the high com-
missioner ismail chak so email in stature that his

turned slowly round sweeping his glass over the
limitless field of ice which glared in the sun like a
silver mirror

  he shook his head what a sight as many
times as one reads about it in the papers sees it
thick furs made him resemble a round hairy ball
pictured or watches it through
the television machine one still
finds the reality astonishing
his companion the geologist
vanderstrassen whom the gov-
ernment of the united states of
africa had sent with the com-
missioner as his scientific coun-
sel lowered his glass

  yes in this respect we are
very much like our ancestors in
spite of all the changes which
have taken place in the course
of centuries in spite of all our
technical progress and the trans-
formation of our methods of
thinking i take it the north is
new to you commissioner
as a young man i was in the
consular service in paris and
once made an excursion to the
channel thats as

 e offer herewith to our readers another of
 the masterly interplanetary stories of the fu-
 ture that we have brought from germany
 and translated it is a worthy successor to the thrill-
 ing works of otto willi gail and otfrid von han-
 stein

     the story deals very powerfully with a subject
 that we think all too little about yet one that is of
 the utmost importance to us we know that our
 life on earth like bacteria on the surface of an
 apple as our author puts it is very precarious an
 infinitesimal disturbance in the cosmos can wipe us
 out just as the bacteria can be wiped from the ap-
 ple

     we know that ice ages swept over the earth
 and destroyed a good part of humanity it is even
 possible that in a past age humanity may have risen
 to a respectable degree of civilization only to be
 thrown back to the level of the brute by a cosmic
 cataclysm

     there is no reason why some force outside the
 earth even outside the solar system cannot operate
 again to endanger or destroy us and what would
 man do if such as the cosmic cloud arrived and
 threatened once more to beat our race back to the
 savagery from which we have painfully climbed
 the story answers these questions in a really remark-
 able tale

far north as i have
ever been before
but that was in the
summer and i had
little opportunity to
see the ice and
snow thats what
makes this enchant-
ed world so aston-
ishing to me as it
is to all the people
from the equator
the short pudgy
gentleman turned in
the other direction
thoughtfully con-
templating the hori-
zon with his glass

v	a n d e r strassen
compass and map in
hand stood behind
him

tion of europe

  if it were only europe vanderstrassen it
wouldnt be so bad the inhabitants of the old cen-
ter of civilization could be saved by migrating
but as it is the whole of northern asia and north
america are menaced as well it will be a catas-
trophe such as the world has never seen

  vanderstrassen nodded and an expression of
profound concern appeared on his face but since
he affected an optimistic viewpoint he said

  we shouldnt forget that the glaciers from the
north are gaining very slowly in the course of the
centuries and that the south of europe will remain
habitable for a long time to come though i sup-
pose the mediterranean lands will slowly acquire
a scandinavian climate northern asia is god be
praised very thinly inhabited and the people of
the canadian republic can crowd around the coast-
lines for a while

  the high commissioner chak moved his head
impatiently

  oh yes they can eke out an existence here and
there no doubt but this is not the really grave
difficulty that menaces our planet - even us in-
habitants of the torrid zone the question of food
has become so increasingly grave in the last cen-
tury that we are genuinely alarmed the north-
ern hemisphere with all its population is slowly
going to the dogs the grain areas are not pro-
ducing the cries of distress constantly increase
of course we do what we can but a few more
crop failures in china in india in south america
and our own country and we will be faced by a
really horrible catastrophe

  im not giving away any state secrets you un-
derstand but you can be sure that the members
of the international food commission which met
in madras left the hall feeling very despondent
especially since the experiments in artificial food
conducted by the south american corella again
resulted in utter failure

  no no believe me things are much worse
than we dare to tell the public and the damned
future looks anything but rosy there may be a
little silver lining in the cloud however you can
put me down for a fool if you like but i have al-
ways imagined that this condition would end as
quickly as it began and that the good old sun would
resume its duty

  im only a statesman and dont understand all
this scientific nonsense but it seems to me that
some day that damned cloud or whatever it is
must end the learned rawlinson of the cape
observatory has been totting up endless figures on
the nebulous monster which has invaded our poor
solar system but who the devil believes anything
these astronomers say it might very well be al-
together different from what he imagines-dont
you think

on historic ground

vanderstrassen smiled he was about to
give a revealing and not encouraging reply to
this tirade when a voice was heard from the other
side of the ice-field

  both men turned several hundred feet away
from them a huge metallic projectile glittered amid

the snow sharply silhouetted against the white
two men were standing beside it one of them
advanced toward the high commissioner waving a
sheet of paper in his hand

  hey a message

  the secretary approached two calls your ex-
cellency one from home from zanzibar the other
from the president of the united states of europe

  very good will you read them to us please
mr hamadan or are they important state sec-
rets not to be heard by the profane ears of our
learned friend

  nothing of special importance permit me
zanzibar senate-office of the united states of
africa june  session of the great council
called for june  expect your return in time
for meeting and here is the second message
to his excellency ismail chak the high com-
missioner of the united states of africa now in
europe request the honor of a visit from you at
your convenience signed basinzani president
of the united states of europe rome 

  good is there nothing else mr hamadan
well now lets see how we can work this out gen-
tlemen come on back to the ship we will have
to consult the engineer in order to lay out our
timetable

  the chubby little man strutted at the head of the
party gesticulating actively like a curling-iron
he skidded over the icy surface his companions
followed more slowly

  the sun was mirrored on the sides of the pro-
jectile which gave a singular aspect of habitation
to this remote spot amid the eternal ice of the
northern edge of norway the projectile itself
which seemed to be the bullet of some titanic gun
was in reality a peaceful means of transportation
-the stage-coach of the year 

  projectiles and cannon were thank god no
more except amid the dusty halls of museums
they were exhibited side by side with six thous-
and year old egyptian mummies models of ships
and locomotives of the nineteenth century air-
planes and antiquated telescopes microscopes and
the apparatus of the crude telegraphy and tele-
phony of the twentieth and twenty-second cen-
turies reminding the beholder of ages long past

  and still it was not unlike a shell propelled by
an explosive which would have afforded a fiendish
pleasure to those sons of an earlier age who had
ruined half of europe much the same type of ex-
plosive was used to be sure but no gun was nec-
essary as the steely projectile fired itself into
space being at the same time both gun and bullet

  yes here in the midst of old ice-locked europe
which had long since turned over its role of leader-
ship to the other continents was a masterpiece of
the engineering of the third millennium one had
to admit that the africans in this respect were
far ahead of all other peoples a millennium be-
fore america had still been the land of grandiose
technical accomplishment asias peoples led by
russia and japan had followed suit ultimately
dethroning the land of columbus and bringing to
fruition an entirely new type of science

  an altogether new spirit took hold of affairs
the soul of asia spoke for the first time and spoke
in an unfamiliar way for america had always re-
the cosmic cloud	

mained a kind of overgrown europe discovered
and settled by europeans the asiastics genius
did not run toward the gigantic he was of a land
of philosophers of brilliant chemists and physi-
cists but not of surpassing mechanical technique
at least it was not the land of the gigantic engin-
eering works for which our own planet was all
too small and which could have attained their full-
est development only on the titan jupiter

  far otherwise with the africans of the year


  this people rendered the impossible possible
the utilization of solar heat which had attained
a high level of perfection in america seemed to
them too unimportant a matter to deserve atten-
tion they had harnessed the eternal wave-beat
of the ocean with its millions of horse-power to
their machines and while the asiatics saw lis-
tened and photographed for thousands of miles
with their wonderful instruments and the indian
physicians succeeded in actually reviving the dead
when no important organs were destroyed the af-
ricans drew new marvels from the earth itself us-
ing the fiery streams from the very bowels of the
planet to bring to light new substances of which
the old world had not even a conception

  through their investigations into the chemical
substances of the deeper layers they had discover-
ed almost by chance the explosive which concen-
trated such incredible power in so small a volume
this usambaranite was used in the newmethod of
transportation by which people shot themselves
from country to country-for this method of travel
by rocket could be described in no other way

  the old artillerists had had many unpleasant en-
counters with the principle of recoil which threw
their guns backward at the moment of discharge
the enormous power of usambaranite would sim-
ply have heaved those old guns from their foun-
dations but now the vice of recoil was changed
into a virtue

  the new explosive was used not to fire the pro-
jectile but the gun itself and was kept firing in
such a manner that the gun raced through space
at ever-increasing speed driven by the rapidly-
succeeding recoil impulses the whole trick con-
sisted in making the gun into a flying-machine
- so that it held passengers - and in providing
means for directing its course

  the old-fashioned propeller which had pulled
airplanes through the ocean of the skies had been
abolished but the wings could not be spared on
the sides of this projectile the wide-spread steel
wings shimmered in the sun like the wings of a bee

difficult experiments hardy less horrible
in result than the battlefields of bygone days
had brought the device to such a state of perfec-
tion that it had become a dependable means of
transportation the aircraft lying here among
the glaciers of norway had within  hours come
from zanzibar south of the equator to the last
icy outposts of northern europe a distance of
more than  miles of course standerton-quil
one of the most adroit engineers in the govern-
ment service had personally piloted the vehicle

  he stood there now hands buried in trouser
pockets staring at the miserable ice desert before

him with an expression of annoyance why there
was not a single piece of machinery here to offer
intellectual exercise to a man with an air of con-
tempt he spat into the snow and for the fortieth
time delivered a brief lecture on the lubrication
system of the ignition apparatus to his mechanic

  here we are again standerton-quil what
do you think of all this ice around here

  he shrugged i have no use for it commission-
er positively no use whatever

  but please my dear fellow said ismail chak
with a laugh that was almost annoyed you are
standing on historic ground here beneath your
feet were once upon a time great cities here
lived the people who discovered america it was
the home of the man who discovered the south
pole approximately two thousand years after
christ here was born the man who first displayed
the flag on the north pole is it not really tragic
that the homeland of these people who penetrated
to the center of this empire of crystalline wonders
is now itself buried under ice and snow that here
the extinct eskimos are being in a sense of the
word brought to life again

  give it up commissioner said hamadan the
secretary with a smile this standerton-quil is
the most unhistorical being under the sun his
brain is a collection of algebraic formulae his heart
an usambaranite motor his thoughts are directed
entirely along a chain of technical concepts levers
cranks axles wheels and hfe moves in terms of
wave-power stations and earth-boring plants al-
ready we have made no end of futile efforts to make
him realize the tragedy of the northern hemi-
sphere

  what do you want gentlemen  to me the whole
thing is a technical problem you see this earth
is an apple inhabited by bacteria it is being heat-
ed and illuminated by a great electric bulb the
whole business happened to get mixed up with a
cloud of dust so that the apple no longer receives
sufficient heat and the bacteria on its coldest areas
are no longer able to sustain life can no longer
find nourishment since the northern and southern
regions of the apple have been covered with frost
its a most simple affair there isnt a trace of
complexity or romance about it

  the only question is how we can manage to get
the bulb and the apple out of the damned cloud or
else provide nourishment and shelter for the bac-
teria of the north and south somewhere else it
seems to me these are technical problems and i am
interested in the whole thing from this point of
view alone one must not lose sight of the gen-
eral idea

  right you are my dear standerton-quil re-
plied ismail chak making a futile effort to clap
the engineer who surmounted him by three feet
on the shoulder you see the matter from the
correct viewpoint we poor devils have only the
trivial but unavoidable mission of providing fotwl
for those millions of bacteria no engineer on
earth with all his levers and wheels can help us out
of this pinch as long as his machines will not pro-
duce grain and meat but should you succeed in
blowing away the dust-cloud which has blanketed
the heat-providing bulb and is keeping out the heat
rays you would be the greatest man in the world
	wonder stories quarterly

and the hero of the nation you could be certain of
the next presidency

  standerton smiled and then replied

  when one thinks that this planet contains in
its depths such enormous reserves of heat lying
idle there and that that it is only a question of
conducting these streams of heat up to the polar
regions of the earth it appears not entirely be-
yond the imagination to bring about the impossible
you know that our earth in long past ages was a
little sun a lava-ball which cooled off and wrapped
itself in a blanket of stone while the interior heat
has been preserved almost unchanged down to our
own time how thick is this earth crust which
partitions us from the eternal fire vanderstras-
sen who is an expert will confirm the fact that this
crust is not proportionately thicker than an egg-
shell am i not right vanderstrassen

  on the whole you are perfectly correct stan-
derton lets see every forty meters we pene-
trate into the earth brings up the temperature by
one degree centigrade at a depth of forty kilo-
meters the heat would therefore be as high as 
degrees at a depth of  kilometers all geological
formations would be in a viscous state if the im-
mense pressure of the layers above did not pre-
vent it and in spite of the intense heat at the
center of the earth the mass must be more dense
than steel since approximately  kilograms
are pressing on each square centimeter and thus
keeping together those substances which the heat
would otherwise disintegrate as gases

  ah yes and a traveller who could proceed ver-
tically toward the center of the earth would at the
end of eight hours march reach a point where the
temperature is a thousand degrees damned if
we wouldnt use such temperatures somehow you
know that we are about to use some of the heat
from the more lofty volcanoes industrially and i
tell you it would be possible with some ingenuity
to penetrate even deeper than we do now-even if
we have to blast half the earth away with a charge
of usambaranite

chapter ii

a desolate world

standerton-quil shook his fist against the
impassive sky and beat the ice with his huge
boots as though he were trying to open a canal
for the latent heat of mother earth at a single
effort

  ismail chak laughed at the engineers impotent
rage and his companions joined him gaily

  this man would have the nerve to blast us off
to the moon with his usambaranite said the high
commissioner and such a comical expression of
mock horror appeared on his features that even
the irritated engineer could not help but join in the
general merriment

  well well see said he everyone has his ideas
and this is mine

  good luck but now gentlemen we must out-
line our journey lets spend the rest of the day
till nightfall in getting acquainted with this region
from a greater altitude by sundown i would like
to leave this land of misery behind me and you

too i imagine are quite keen on returning to civil-
ization it would seem a good idea to head for the
nice airport so that we can make rome tomorrow
to accept the invitation of his excellency the
president of the united states of europe day af-
ter tomorrow i intend being back in zanzibar we
can make it by evening if our friend standerton
doesnt lie down on the job

  i guarantee a speed of  kilometers on the
way back within six hours we will be at nice
in ten we can cover the distance from rome to the
equator and two hours more will bring us over
the searchlights of the airport of bagamojo

  the engineer buried his measuring-wheel in his
coat pocket and folded the map

  lets go then gentlemen therell be plenty of
time for a bite and a nap during the journey

  the projectile consisted of three parts in front
was the bridge with the control apparatus for al-
titude and speed as well as the steering-gear which
required special attention huge compasses and
marvellous transparent maps of the region to be
traversed which unrolled themselves automatically
facilitated the task of the quartermaster

  at the tail of the vehicle in the fan-shaped base
was the mechanic whose duty it was to watch the
correct functioning of the usambaranite motors
which pushed the successive charges into the com-
bustion chambers this portion of the vessel had
to withstand enormous heat a labor which could
be performed adequately only by platinum a thor-
oughly ingenious cooling system utilizing liquid
helium the temperature of which approaches 
degrees cared for the preservation of this most
important portion of the machinery

  the central compartment was reserved for the
use of the passengers and was provided with deep-
ly-cushioned seats anchored solidly to the floor
they were ranged around a big table and in them
the travellers were sure of being protected from
the none-too-gentie shocks of the travelling projec-
tile as long as they were careful to remain in their
places some comfort had of course to be sacri-
ficed in view of the immense speed which in a few
hours carried the travellers distances which in
former days could only have been covered after
many days journey by ship and railroad

  ismail chak ridding himself of his thick furs
oozed plumply through the narrow entrance with
his companions following the mechanic screwed
in place the thick headlights over the windows
bolted the door and disappeared into his sanctum
the low hum of the automatic combustion cham-
bers soon made itself audible

  for a few moments the head of standerton-quil
was visible at one of the windows of the control
chamber his energetic face bore a melancholy
smile as he watched the sparks from his cigarette
trail down across the snowy plain as there now
lay before him long hours of deprivation from his
only pleasure that he might direct this huge tin-
can over continents and oceans

  now his head disappeared into the round port-
hole the window snapped shut the bolt crashed
into place the engineer tested his speedometer
adjusted compass and map gave his control de-
vices a rapid inspection and pushed the attention
signal a melodious whistling not unlike the call
the cosmic cloud	

of the curlew which once heard is unforgettable
sounded through the chambers of the big vehicle
the passengers took their places pushing their
legs into the bracing-cushions the mechanic se-
cured himself in his cushion-lined seat the alarm-
whistle ceased

  the red signal of the engine-room telegraph lit
up the mechanic pulled a lever and the first usam-
baranite charge was ignited in the combustion
chamber a sharp report a heavy shock and the
discharged gases pushed against the basal piece of
the projectile which trembled slightly with the
shock shot followed shot in a drumfire of explo-
sions and the projectile moved obliquely upward
into space swaying from side to side as the power
increased

  the horses of the police detachment shied irrit-
ably on the snow-field below by the time they had
been quieted the strange vehicle had already pass-
ed beyond their vision standerton-quil directed
the flight with consummate skill once in motion
the vehicle proceeded smoothly and quietly it had
only the air resistance to overcome yellow and
green signal lights alternately flashed on and off in
the engine compartment as standerton-quil or-
dered explosions in the right and then the left
chamber to give the flying car a turn to this side or
that making the task of steering easier

the speedometer climbed from  to  from
 to  and finally up to  kilometers an
hour the compass showed a nor-northwest
course the barometer registered an altitude of
 meters slowly the wonderful transparent
map rolled off a wide celluloid band the result of
the international photo-surveys extended over the
whole surface of the earth during the last decades
an index indicating the location of the projectile
at the moment slowly slid across the map a thin
pen at the bottom traced out the route in all its
convolutions with a thread of ink losing ones
way was a practical impossibility with such appar-
atus

  here amidst the instruments which were the
sense-organs of this apparently ungainly vehicle
as it raced over the earth the strange man was in
his element here he found the satisfaction of the
artist in handling the ingenious mechanism of this
newest and fastest of rocket-cars - principally
of his own design

  meanwhile mamadan the secretary was sending
wireless messages from the desk of the passenger
cabin to zanzibar and rome notifying the nice
airport of the impending arrival of the government
rocket-car during the late hours of the evening
he could have communicated with all these places
by direct word of mouth from the speeding vessel
had it not been for the disturbing noise of the ex-
plosions-a hindrance to free communication which
had not yet been dealt with

  perhaps im too old said the high commis-
sioner settling back in the upholstery but i must
say that i never do feel quite at home in this tin-
can for heavens sake dont tell that to stander-
ton-quil but i cant help comparing myself to a
sardine and one can only stand the starting mo-
tion if one packs all ones vital organs into a single
parcel and checks it with the mechanic

  how that man stands it in the engine-room is a
mystery to me really travelling was far more
comfortable in my salad days theres nothing
like the old airplanes with their buzzing propellers
you may laugh and you may think me dated but
i like to remember the good old days with their
three hundred kilometer-an-hour kondor airplanes
the modern urge for speed has got hold of all of
you think of the people of the earlier centuries
who had to put up with the slow railroads and be
glad if they cover a hundred kilometers an hour
i dont feel so well myself in this usambaranite
vehicle commissioner said the geologist vander-
strassen with a smile but it is not so much the
speed and the constant shocks as the thought that
one is flying so to speak inside a combustion cham-
ber the power of which is so gigantic that any ac-
cident would be enough to resolve us into our com-
ponent atoms and scatter the atoms all through in-
terplanetary space

  not a very pleasant thought doctor yet when
one looks on the iron face of standerton through
this little window and watches his calm and ac-
curate movements which never seem to err by a
millimeter or a fraction of a second one regains
a certain measure of assurance

  over there gentlemen exclaimed hamadan
and pointed with his finger toward the inch-thick
plate glass of the porthole

  beneath them was the frozen ocean covered with
little ice-hummocks bordered in the distance by a
silvery mountain-chain that sparkled in the sun-
light like a huge diamond

  the greenland coast said the geologist from
which the mighty glaciers force their way across
the oceans toward europe and north america
there lies the cradle of the big icebergs which are
now coming as far south as the equator to break
on the coasts of africa and bring down to us some
of the chill of the arctic

  im only surprised that it is not much colder
up here in these latitudes i imagined ones breath
would freeze at ones mouth and yet it really
wasnt so terribly cold down there on the ice-pack
i think we all have mistaken notions about the ice-
age that is those of us who are not experts like
you mr vanderstrassen

  yes its a general and mistaken conception
commissioner to assume that only a perfectly fab-
ulous cold snap could cause such an extension of
the ice-cap very careful measurements of tem-
perature kept on record for thousands of years
indicate that the average temperature of europe
has only decreased by a few degrees in earlier
ages it was about  degrees plus and remained
unchanged at that figure for many centuries and
has now come down only to eight degrees this
doesnt look like much of a drop and anyone who
deals only superficially with the manifestations
and effects of such a decrease in temperature find
it difficult to understand why it should lead to the
ice covering great parts of our continents

  but you dont want to forget that time is the
chief factor in this game rain and snow have in-
creased considerably in the north of the globe as
well as in the south mainly because of the exist-
ence of finely-divided dust in the atmosphere this
dust has its origin in the cosmic cloud into which
	wonder stories quarterly

our entire solar system has plunged the rays of
the sun have been so interrupted by this dust-eloud
that the temperature has been on the decrease for
decades the result is those masses of ice which
formed in the arctic during the winter cannot be
melted during the summer our winters have been
prolonged so to speak the ice increases daily and
since it cannot grow into the skies its forces its
way farther south across land and sea

  thus the arctic is reaching its deadly icy arms
farther and farther toward the equator from
greenland from norway from the arctic sea the
white death is sweeping down upon us the oceans
of the north are covered with ice and the winds
that have their origin there have acquired increased
refrigerating capacity and have drawn europe
northern asia and north america into the arctic
zone it is really a very simple matter

  a hell of an outlook said the high commis-
sioner looking with a sigh at the crystalline fields
below against whose icy breath all the wonderful
inventions of modern humanity were powerless

   its not the first time earth has had to face such
a situation opined vanderstrassen about for-
ty thousand years ago the same sort of thing oc-
curred our ancestors have conducted careful in-
vestigations on the glacial periods in those days
the glaciers reached the foothills of the alps it
was during the period while man still half-animal
chased his dinner with a stone axe and dwelt in a
cave

  the man of prehistoric time was contemporary
with that glacial epoch in short and not even
that was the earths first encounter with ice traces
in the geological formations the shorthand notes
earth has made in her diary tell us that millions
of years earlier after a tropical era throughout
the world when even the arctic bloomed with wide
forests there occurred with considerable sudden-
ness a cold period with its ensuing ice-caps for
thousands of years our archaeologists have faced
this inexplicable mystery and we are the genera-
tion to see with our own eyes such a period of ill-
ness on the part of mother earth and to learn that
a cloud of dust in space is at the bottom of the
trouble

  your disquisition is extremely useful vander-
strassen i believe this is the first time i have had
things placed in their true perspective in spite of
the amount i have read about them our flight
over this region helps one to conceive it more
vividly

the rocket-car had long since changed its
course and was now heading south in a
sweeping curve it bore back to the mountain chains
of norway below them lay land buried beneath
hundreds of meters of ice as far as the gulf of
bothnia the white tongues of the glaciers licked
out beyond in the direction of the atlantic the
icy arms broke in the rocky fjords falling into the
ocean in the form of bergs which ground amid the
pack-ice that covered the whole ocean and heaved
with the ground-swell the country lay dead and
deserted farther south white plains of snow
gleamed in the light pack-ice and bergs drifted
across the north sea

  the green starboard signal-light blinked in the

engine-room standerton-quil was demanding in-
creased explosions in the right chamber to make a
turn a handful of little white clouds went past
the window with lightning speed a slight tremb-
ling of the racing machine and the projectile swung
slowly toward the southeast a wide river became
visible along the line of their flight

  the rhine said vanderstrassen bending over
his map the classic land of glacial research lies
beneath us-germany

  she seems to have been spared the disaster of
a coat of ice so far

  correct but over all her vast flatlands the
slowly-moving streams of the norwegian glaciers
will force their way as they did forty thousand
years ago the last ice-age produced these wide
loamy plains interspersed with blocks of granite
the glaciers brought those rocks down here from
scandinavia and ground the other material up to
form the fine sand which now covers the plains
of germany and in a few countries they will again
overwhelm the whole country the archaeologists
of millenia to come will excavate the great buried
cities and find a thousand and one testimonials to
the culture of this land when the earth again enters
a warm period

  our race has found only primitive hatchets and
arrowheads and the almost beast-like skulls of the
mammoth cave-bear and reindeer and the highest
creations they have discovered are crude drawings
of animals scratched on the walls of the caves it
will be left to a future generation to bring to light
after the approaching ice-age the great technical
achievements and cosmopolitan cities of the modern
period

 you are looking through blue glasses my dear
vanderstrassen and there is a certain touch of the
gruesome in your predictions

  yes commissioner nature is cruel at least
she appears so to us humans she goes her way
unconcerned cause and effect are her sole rules of
conduct and she buries cultures as some gigantic
foot would crush an ant-hill

  enveloped in strange ruddy trailers of cloud the
sun was sinking in the west in the south the icy
peaks of the alps caught the last rays of the depart-
ing day and the earth was covering itself with a
mantle of blue and violet but in the zenith hung a
strange purplish gleam amid which queer little
green clouds floated such as had never or at least
very seldom been seen by mean of the earlier days
only when mighty volcanoes had thrown enormous
masses of ash into the atmosphere had such phen-
omena been visible the cause of this singular
coloration was the cosmic dust which had pene-
trated the atmosphere producing deflections and
reflections of the last rays of the sun that swept
mysterious rings and rays through the erstwhile
blue of the ether

  the rocket-car was circling westwards around
the alpine massif gliding over the pallid surface of
lake constance amid a drumfire of explosions

   the travellers grew silent each following his in-
dividual train of thought slowly the purple gleam
turned pale snapping auroral rays reached like
gigantic arms across the skies here and there a
star glittered brightly and presently the moon rose
the cosmic cloud	

in a torrent of blood-red around which played a
wreath of green rays

  standerton-quil recognized the flaming lights
of the nice airport in the distance he was now
firing a series of brilliant rockets that scattered
away behind into thousands of starlets the air-
port replied with green and red flares the offi-
cial vehicle of the united states of africa had been
sighted ten minutes later it lay still in the wide
hangars on the mediterranean shore

chapter iii

a sensational story

p enjamin graachten the famous jour-
h nalist editor of the african herald ran both
his hands through the grey crown of hair which
surrounded his bald head as a little forest sur-
rounds a still lake

  at the moment he looked inconceivably comic
for the disordered locks resembled an accumula-
tion of question-marks standing up from the level
of his skull his sub-editors called him the mara-
bou and that nickname had gained currency
through all south africa but was best known in
cape town where the huge office of the african
herald occupied an entire block with its editorial
offices wireless stations telephotograph studios its
extensive composing rooms and printing plants

  for heavens sake old man this wont work
you mustnt forget that the african herald is and
must remain the liveliest newspaper south of the
equator to hell with such stodgy stuff first
of all put that manifesto from the president of
the united states of europe to the peoples of the
earth on the front page and put with it that report
on ismail chaks trip to the ice region by all
means dont forget to throw in a few of the pic-
tures taken from the rocket-car during the journey
-in their natural colors that one-lets see-
put it about here and the pictures here and then a
leader on the significance of the problems which
will be discussed in the extraordinary session of the
senate of africa at zanzibar next ismail chaks
interview with the president of europe

  frarelli has just sent it from genoa by telauto-
graph put the pictures of the arrival of the
vehicle in rome in here and drop in the picture
of the reception of his excellency by president
basinzani at the government palace some good
telepictures got here an hour ago so much for
this-lay out the rest of that junk any way you
like

  isnt it a little late to tear the paper apart like
that

  well what are you here for

  it will be hardly possible to get the colored pic-
tures into the early edition

  jump in and do it anyway go ahead and work
it out

  and now it was the unfortunate city editors
turn to run both hands through his hair he
snatched up the papers and turned worriedly tow-
ard the door

  benjamin graachten the marabou laughed
cheerfully

come on sobel smoke one of these wonderful

 cigarettes and all your sorrows will dissolve into
 blue rings i know you down inside you are
 wishing this damn marabou in hell but youll get
 it done in spite of that

 the two men lighted their cigarettes and parted
 with a handshake of mutual congratulation

 graachten was about to put in a call to his cor-
 respondent in calcutta when a green light appeared
 in the wall of his office an orifice of three or four
 inches across surrounded by a rim of bronze ap-
 peared in the wall the loud-speaking telephone

 proceed said the editor-in-chief of the african
 herald somewhat reluctant to be disturbed

 the voice of the invisible interlocutor sounded
 through the room loud and clear

 mr wanjansa wants to speak to you-
 busy

 just a few minutes

 not one

 its important

 tell wanjansa that he will see me for the last
 time in his life if hes lying let him in

 a few minutes later the door swung open and
 wanjansa a veritable giant in stature dressed in
 impeccable taste entered the room an accom-
 plished journalist and an authority on sports wan-
 jansa was a not-unimportant member of the afri-
 can heralds staff but benjamin graachten left
 it to his department men to deal with problems that
 were not of the first importance furthermore he
 did not like the man any too well

 wanjansa could not deny his basuto blood the
 blood of a race long at enmity with the dutch
 though civilization had long since bridged those
 gaps and these natives had been incorporated into
 the great family of the african nation as civilized
 and in many cases highly educated individuals
 aversions and preferences of ancient origin con-
 tinued to manifest themselves here and there
 good morning sir

good morning mr wanjansa i have two
minutes for you blaze away

 do you know johannes baumgart

 no

 the man is a german

 i should hardly have taken him for a chinaman
 with that name twenty-five seconds go on
 he arrived here three days ago

 of extraordinary interest to me it probably
 became too cold for him in his own country

 a distinguished scientist

 you dont say forty seconds go on

 he wants to fly to the moon

 bon voyage

 and he will make it

 probably as surely as the frenchman bourquin
 who undertook the same job in  to see with
 his own eyes what his compatriot jules verne had
 visualized in his famous novels you know that
 his vehicle crashed into the atlantic from an alti-
 tude of eighty kilometers and no trace of him was
 ever found

 t am sure that you look at the matter from the
  wrong point of view mr graachten the
 fact that your sporting editor comes to you with
 this news which is still exclusive tempts you to
 assume that it is a foolhardy sports stunt had


wonder stories quarterly

 a scientist brought you the news you would have
 looked at it differently this mr baumgart knows
 very well what he is going he is a quiet serious
 scientist and the basis of his undertaking is a care-
 fully thought-out theory he wishes to interest
 the government

  where the devil did you get this gammon

  i overheard it unintentionally listen-yester-
day i visited the manager of the usambaranite
works to discuss a usambaranite-drive auto racer
he had a visitor i remained in the ante-chamber
through an oversight at the switchboard the con-
nection between the office of the manager and the
ante-chamber was kept in and the loud-speaking
phone gave me very distinctly the entire conver-

the archaeologists of millennia to come will excavate the
great buried cities and find a thousand and one testi-
monials of the culture of this land

it but since no one else knows about it the news

 is just as hot now as it was then

 well-there might be something in it

 thank god at last youre coming off your
 perch

sation that took place between the two there-
fore if youre going to use this story the source
ought to be kept quiet

you heard that yesterday why the devil
didnt you jump to me right then

an unavoidable trip to johannesburg prevented

  but tell me-what does this baumgart want
to do on the moon  that is if he gets there which
i doubt

  he is undertaking this dangerous experiment
in the interest of humanity and the approaching
ice-age is his incentive
the cosf

  but what has the moon got to do with the ice-
age and humanity i dont understand

  this baumgart expects to get some information
from the moon on how to solve our earthly prob-
lems

but by the holy chinchinchindra of calcutta
there are no people on the moon and the whole
place is as dead and stiff as so much plaster
whos going to give him any information there
the people of the moon

  then hes a fool there arent any people
but wait mr graachten it is from the remains
of the extinct moon-people that he expects to get
the information

  its getting more and more mixed up

  this man baumgart being a first-class astrono-
mer makes the statement and it is impossible for
us as mere laymen to give an accurate opinion of
the value or uselessness of his plans my dear edi-
tor

  you are right at that wanjansa and any-
how the affair has its importance

  the two minutes are up mr graachten
wait stick around for a minute-and thanks
for the tip but lets go on what does this ger-
man explorer expect to find on the moon which has
been dead for millions of years as everybody
knows

  he is of the opinion that this satellite of ours
was formerly inhabited by beings similar to us
and that the last generation of the moon-people
passed out of existence during just such an ice-age
as ours but since the lunarites had a much older
civilization behind them than we he assumes that
they had found a means of sustaining life in spite
of the cold when some greater catastrophe over-
whelmed their home making it a graveyard for-
ever

  and this man will succeed in finding out the
experience of the lunarites with a slowly-cooling
world and make use of them for our benefit i take
it

  just so

  not a bad idea wanjansa

  i quite agree mr graachten

  the only thing that isnt clear to me is why our
giant telescopes cannot detect a trace of human
activity past or present on the moon

  baumgart voiced his opinion on this point also
but in the midst of what he was saying on the sub-
ject the phone suddenly began crackling and then
went dead the faulty connection must have been
discovered and set to rights at any rate i didnt
hear another word i slipped away without being
seen and rushed to you to tell you about it
which was very sensible of you i see now that
you will be useful for other things than reporting
sports events and you may be sure ill remember
it

  mr wanjansa flattered bowed praised from
the mouth of benjamin graachten was a rarity of
high order for the old marabou avoided any
marks of appreciation so far as possible it made
people slow on their feet he used to say

  you are sure that beside yourself and the man-
ager of the usambaranite works nobody overheard
the conversation

  quite sure

ic cloud	

    i hope they will be discreet about it

    at the beginning of the conversation the visitor
 asked the manager to regard the whole business as
 confidential saying that he had only come to get
 information about the practicability of using usam-
 baranite in connection with a new kind of rocket-
 this being the only means ho considered good
 enough for a flight to the moon

  q plendid but do you know what gives me

   o	the greatest kick the thought of the as-
 tonished faces of the two gentlemen when they see
 the entire plan discussed in the second morning
 edition of the herald of course without mention-
 ing any names the walls always have ears in our
 business but that our walls should overhear the
 walls of the far-away usambaranite works will
 strike those people as something spooky it cer-
 tainly is a masterpiece of modern reporting you
 will keep quiet

   that goes without saying

   now lets get busy my dear wanjansa snap
 into it put everything you have told me into an
 exciting smooth-reading news story your lead
 will be something about the salvation of mankind-
 help from the outside universe-a bold plan to
 cope with the dangers menacing the earth from the
 north

   good

    by tomorrow noon ill have a detailed interview
 with rawlinson the director of the cape town
 observatory as a follow-up hell give us the pros
 and cons of the business

   do you want me to go see rawlinson

 he would refuse to see you and a thousand
  others wanjansa i must go in person and right
 now in the middle of the night he wont let me
 down as im the man who has blown his trumpet
 all through the world our paper has always been
 on his side in his controversies with scientific op-
 ponents and hes not the man to forget it

    very well then ill get to work at once youll
 have your story by three oclock

   good one more thing-try to get hold of your
 man that interesting german first thing in the
 morning by all means stick on the tails of the
 immigration authorities lay siege to the usam-
 baranite works hop to it for all youre worth try
 the german club and tell your man that the african
 herald wants to lend him a hand in pushing this
 thing and has an army of three million readers be-
 hind it but be sure that all his plans publica-
 tions experiences are sold to us exclusively tell
 him the first wireless dispatch from the moon will
 appear in red ink on the front page of the african
 herald come on lets go-you can arrange every-
 thing with sobel and ill leave immediately for
 zanzibar

   wanjansa took up his hat a grin of pleasure
 spreading across his broad negroid features at
 last he was hitting it off with the most powerful
 newspaperman in the world he squeezed the ex-
 tended hand with cordiality and stepped out of
 benjamin graachtens office he was whistling a
 gay air to himself as the elevator carried him down

	  

   our conversation has been somewhat lengthy
 mr baumgart said edward hawthorn the man-
	wonder stories quarterly

 ager of the usambaranite works with a glance at
 the clock i can only say that your project in-
 terests me in the highest degree though a man in
 my position has some very bold and extraordinary
 plans submitted to him you are a stranger here
 its already late and i hope it will be agreeable to
 you if i ask you to be my guest for the rest of the
 evening and for the night before you could get
 back to your hotel your dinner will be already on
 the table and we will have an opportunity for a
 little chat after eating it will be no trouble at
 all as there are always a couple of guest-rooms
 ready because i receive so many out-of-town visit-
 ors

  johannes baumgart looked up at the old-young
man before him with his strangely serious eyes in
which there was always a touch of the other-
worldly

  i thank you said he in the peculiar low-
pitched voice which gave so soft an accent to his
words i thank you very much

  nothing about this man would have given either
a psychologist or physiognomist the impression that
he could entertain bold and sweeping plans there
was no sign in him of designs to stir humanity
it was a slender almost graceful figure that sat in
edward hawthorns office there was no suggestion
of the iron energy that was the distinguishing
characteristic of the african people of the year
 his face was lean and pale and a stubborn
lock of his dark hair tumbled about his high fore-
head to be returned to its place from time to time
by a long thin hand the dark eyes were pensive
almost drowsy behind unrimmed glasses and all
his movements were calm-almost impersonal

  in conversation he frequently gave the impres-
sion of not having heard nothing in his impassive
features betrayed excitement or interest and the
eyes looked past one as though their owner were
far away thinking of things beyond the normal
ken

  suddenly he would interject into a conversation
a question or remark which went to the heart of the
problem under discussion and thus surprise his
vis-a-vis who was generally convinced that he had
not been paying attention

  he made a singular impression on women he
had buried himself for ten years in a little country
cottage on the outskirts of the black forest-an
inheritance from his mother here amid the
rustling trees he had dwelt among his books and
instruments a perfect hermit while brightly-col-
ored streams of life flowed past his door the
world and its ways were strange to this savant of
barely thirty-two no woman had ever played an
important role in his life-or any role for that
matter and he became embarrassed and fell into
silence in the presence of one

  no wonder then that women accustomed to
pleasant badinage from the conversationalists who
played among the parlors thought him reserved and
old-fashioned yet there was something about him
that attracted them for in spite of his youth he had
become a celebrity as the result of his labors of the
last ten years the childlike element in his nature
his timidity his tender almost boyish face with its
dreaming eyes made him altogether different from
those accomplished cavaliers who so elegantly

stroked their beards who smiled at the right mo-
ment and knew how to say pleasant nothings but
who had nothing else to offer

  they tried to drag him into society but he begged
to be excused remained among his solitudes and
only rarely would a new and brilliant book afford
testimony to his continued existence his great
work the universal law of life and death had
stirred the scientific world had raised passionate
debate pro and con but its author remained silent
amid the exploding newspaper paragraphs

  in this many-volumed work he demonstrated that
everything in the universe plants and animals
suns and worlds peoples and cultures obeyed an
inescapable law-the law of life and death he
proved how in accordance with this rule the sun
in the universe and a tiny flower of the fields were
akin and told why this was necessarily true he
went on to the proof that on all stars evolution
must follow the same path that on every one life
has appeared and some type of humanity has been
the apogee of life

 peoples states cultures and their attached reli-
gions arts sciences and morals flourish and die like
flowers here and on other planets where perhaps
higher forms of life had been attained all this
was proved up to the hilt

  we must he concluded utilize the experience
of other worlds as soon as our technical progress
permits us to adventure into space-not for the
purpose of making a fantastic interplanetary jour-
ney but in obedience to a great law of evolution
once every village was a unit later villages
formed into states learning gradually how to ag-
gregate entire continents under a single govern-
ment today we are at the point of making the
entire earth a single nation the monster-state
earth  the coming century will see these ideals
realized the ground for the achievement is even
now being broken

  the day will come when we will have a range
of vision beyond anything the present affords us
did not people once think in terms of the tribe as
a unit then in counties states finally in continents
and in the future will not all the powers of this
planet be eclipsed in a single central power and will
we not think in terms of planets    

chapter iv

a meeting

such was the man johannes baumgart such
was his work and his viewpoint on the universe
his modest almost timid nature stood in profound
contrast to his abundant knowledge the tremen-
dous sweep of his thoughts and plans and yet these
two contrasting elements of his character had a
common basis-the kindness and humanity which
caused him to use his treasure-trove of knowledge
in the service of mankind now drifting toward the
most terrible of catastrophes 

  now he was walking at edward hawthorns side
down the short lane which connected the office
building of the explosive factory and the home of
the manager a moment later they were entering
a stately but not pretentious dwelling attractively
situated amidst a grove of ancient trees
the cosmic cloud	

  mr baumgart will be my guest for tonight
edward hawthorn informed his butler will you
show him to one of the guest rooms and to the
german excuse me a few moments mr baum-
gart in ten minutes i will meet you and my
daughter in the dining room our excellent brown
will see to anything you want

  baumgart followed the butler up the stairs

  as they passed along one of the wide halls where
the sound of their feet was drowned in the carpets
the voice of a singer became audible from one of
the adjacent rooms the air was being carried in
a first-rate soprano voice baumgart began to hum
a low accompaniment

  the sound had come from the room of haw-
thorns only daughter elizabeth lay in the dark-
ness of a soft divan enjoying the wonderful aria
of zadika from the new opera the dead forest
by ibn ben-harsah a favorite composer of the
day which was being transmitted through the
operaphone

  suhalma mirr-edin was singing like an angel
tonight and fluttering across the scene like some
elfin being a circular mirror-or rather a screen
resembling a mirror-a little more than three feet
in diameter hung in a niche on a dark pillar in the
plant-filled room all the gay lively scenery of the
grand opera house at cape town the most import-
ant commercial point of the african south was re-
produced in this screen while the loud-speaking
telephone repeated with the utmost fidelity the
songs of the performers and the music of the or-
chestra the screen showed the scene in charming
reduction giving all the happenings of the stage
in their true lighting and color

  mirr-edin was leaving the stage disappearing
like a gay butterfly into the green leaf-roof of the
mimic forest amid roars of applause from the aud-
ience a knock at the door was heard come in
please

  her fathers head appeared in the aperture

  ah a feast of music wasnt that suhalma
mirr-edin in the butterfly aria  it was quite clear
even outside but come along to dinner daughter
ive brought a guest with me

  oh you best of all fathers isnt it a shame
that ill have to lose you for the evening and listen
to endless technical discussions and the thousand
and one terms of some stupid contract you know
how much i dislike that kind of thing and you
solemnly promised that you would spare me any
more such affairs

  quite right little dreamer but i only want to
drag from your hermitage because this time its
something different this gentleman is a really
interesting person hes a german scientist with
whom i spent some of the most stimulating hours
of my life this afternoon he hasnt a word to say
about inventions or machines boring tools or air-
planes but he has a really fabulous knowledge
about all sorts of things and is cooking up the most
wonderful plan you ever heard of in a few weeks
hell be the best-known man in the world and on
top of all that he has a remarkable agreeable per-
sonality at times hes as timid as a girl

   still young

  eves daughter getting curious eh no-old

as methusaleh nearly seventy all your amorous
tricks will be wasted

  oh what a malicious mind you have however
i shall come

  the grey head with its fine beard disappeared
laughingly from the doorway edward hawthorn
went toward the dining room baumgart rose as
he entered

  you are hew already good-lets sit down
to the table dinner will be served immediately
and my daughter will be here any moment

  i hope i have not disturbed miss hawthorn
there is nothing i dislike more than robbing a
fellow person of comfort in his own home

  we lead a very quiet life here mr baumgart
and in this respect we are very unmodern people
she is my only child two years ago i lost my
wife in an accident-the best wife and mother a
home ever saw-and neither my daughter nor i
have ever really gotten over it we spend most of
our evenings at home and are ardent devotees of
the operaphone though some evenings we read to
each other and a game of color-tone kaleidoscope
sometimes helps us in whiling away the hours my
daughter shows no interest at all in business mat-
ters nor does she find the technical discussions i
sometimes have to conduct with my guests amusing
thats what makes me certain she will enjoy listen-
ing to the ideas of a philosopher like you for a
change

  im a poor conversationalist mr hawthorn i
run heavily to monosyllables i am a sworn enemy
of the type of persiflage that passes for conversa-
tion in salons as it is at least in my country not
very different from dressing up on such occasions-
or perhaps i should liken it to the use of jewelry
among ladies it is a kind of mental show-window
decorating it seldom goes any deeper than that
and i think its rare to find either knowledge or
ability behind such verbal fireworks company
becomes flat when it is not reduced to a small and
well-chosen circle that is why i am a pre-emin-
ently unsociable man

  we take a similar attitude and my wifes point
of view which my daughter has inherited was the
same it seems to be at the bottom of the german
temperament because-

at this moment elizabeth hawthorn entered
the dining room they were introduced a
slight feeling of embarassment descended upon the
two elizabeth had actually expected to find an
old sage in the german style with a waving white
beard and johannes baumgart who always felt so
insecure in the presence of ladies had hardly ex-
pected to find so young a girl in the daughter of
his host

  at the introduction he bowed slightly swept the
stubborn lock back from his forehead and dived
into silence

  something about elizabeth hawthorn attracted
him she had a fresh oval face without any parti-
cular beauty in which a pair of nut-brown eyes
claimed his attention a full blonde corona of
hair descended upon a neck that was hardly the
best shaped in the world she wore a close fitting
grey velvet dress with wide collar and cuffs and
not a trace of jewelry nothing remarkable about
	wonder stories quarterly

the ensemble yet there was something that created
a bond between them hawthorns next words
provided the clue to the mystery

  you may speak german if you like mr baum-
gart my wifes relatives came from germany
and the language has always been familiar to us
my father-in-law came here to study tropical dis-
eases he married the daughter of one of the mer-
chant-princes of cape town and became the physi-
cian of the german colony and i edward haw-
thorn who have nothing but english blood in my
veins took his only daughter away from him eli-
zabeth is a perfect replica of her at times the
resemblance is astonishing even to me she brings
back the past to me reminding me of the time when
i first met my wife on an excursion ah those
days of the past

  my german isnt nearly as good as father would
have you believe mr baumgart he fails to notice
it because he only learned a few words of the lan-
guage from my mother but i do a good deal
of reading in the german classics particularly my
mothers favorite poet the immortal goethe
your german is excellent miss hawthorn and
your accent is perfect your mother or rather her
parents must have come from south germany
your pronounciation reminds me of baden or
wurttemberg

  i must confess to my disgrace that i havent the
slightest idea of the geography of your country
said elizabeths father with a shrug of embarrass-
ment i only know that germany is a province
of the united states of europe and lies between the
north sea and the alps of course i know from
my wife who used to sing old german songs that
there is a great river there called the rhine and
i have often heard the name of the town which her
mother came from-kasruh kalsrugh or some-
thing like that

  karlsruhe you see i was right its the
capital city of the state of baden and lies near the
rhine do you know my dear lady that we are
practically neighbors freiburg in the same
state is my home town from the heights around
the town you can see the rhine glittering in the
distance and i stayed for some years in karlsruhe
your grandmothers home town

  you are doubly welcome to our house then mr
baumgart permit me to fill your glass your
health-and that of your homeland

the glasses of the three clinked harmoniously
you must show us the place on the map tomor-
row mr baumgart weimar also and the other
places connected with goethe it will bring me
closer to him

  with the greatest of pleasure miss hawthorn
i share your appreciation of our poet-philosopher
he is an easy man to admire

  isnt it strange that only a few out of the im-
mense army who have marched across the earth in
thousands of years have remained immortal no
matter what happened after their time

  yes miss hawthorn such immortality has a
touch of the truly godlike these few individuals
from the great eras of civilization in china india
chaldea egypt greece and rome arabia and the
whole occident from the gigantic slavic empire
which followed the downfall and the new culture

which has developed in india-these few individ-
uals i say can be compared to mountain peaks
scarcely fifty names altogether

  yet all these great ones though they are parted
by centuries and thousands of miles have one thing
in common-they have the ultimate similarity of
spirit one peak may be made of granite one of
diabase a third of basalt-each has its peculiarity
-but they have much in common and goethe was
infinitely nearer to plato who lived two thousand
years before him than to millions of his contem-
poraries we others are sand-grains in the plain
glad merely to exist in the shade of these gigantic
summits

  elizabeth made no reply the man before her
had a penetrating manner of seeing and judging
things here spoke a type of man altogether differ-
ent from the cold materialists who formed most of
their guests his expressive eyes his deep son-
orous voice carried away his auditors

it was hawthorn who interrupted the silence
i bought the international geographic com-
panys big photographic atlas recently he offered
its a gigantic work-five big volumes each of
them almost ten feet square in the library now
every road every forest every little village is dis-
tinctly pictured tomorrow you can travel through
all germany together in it

  only with our eyes and fingers of course but
it would be a pleasure

  that will be good enough for the present miss
hawthorn but i hope that you and your father will
come to see me in my homeland some day and will
be my guests the world has become so small these
days i should never have dreamed of finding so
german an atmosphere in the home of the manager
of the usambaranite works of south africa or of
talking in german about goethe and germany

  yes mr baumgart that is a privilege you eu-
ropeans enjoy we here in africa know of noth-
ing like that in our one great country all the in-
habitants of a continent but of course this is the
reason why we have progressed so far we have
never suppressed racial peculiarities and we have
permitted all the people of this country to develop
in their own way

  the descendants of the old dutch colonists
make excellent statesmen and farmers the sons of
england develop to the utmost their technical skill
and their commercial aptitude the peoples of north
africa give us our seamen and diplomats the in-
habitants of the nile regions have distinguished
themselves as artists and physicians the native
peoples of the east are expert miners the congo-
zambesi zone and somaliland furnish us with un-
paralleled ranchers-and they all live in peace and
unity under the black and white banner with the
white cross and red crescent all have an equal
voice in the conduct of affairs so far as knowledge
and ability qualify them

  things are much the same in europe now
though old jealousies raise their heads here and
there europe has always been the victim of pe-
culiar conditions it is the old land of minor states
and narrow nationalism which for hundreds of
years caused conflicts and it will take more gen-
erations still to extinguish its last embers in the
the cosmic cloud	

minds of the europeans the great misfortune
which is now sweeping the northern hemisphere
will contribute to a strengthening of the sense of
solidarity

  tomorrow morning we will find your president
basinzanis manifesto in the papers and the sen-
ate of africa will convene on the morning of the
fifteenth i believe they will undertake the im-
portant question of saving europe from the famine
which menaces her

  all such measure will be palliatives mr haw-
thorn the approaching ice-age is manifesting it-
self particularly in the north and south at present
but we must not forget that the glacial period will
eventually embrace the entire globe and that even
the temperature of the equatorial zones will de-
crease and the crops will become poorer and poor-
er

  just at present the crops in the tropical zones
all round the earth are increasing on account of the
increased precipitation and the favorable decrease
in temperature during the hottest months

  to be sure this is a quite natural consequence
but we are only at the beginning of the ice-age and
things will look entirely different to our descend-
ants if we can find no way to cope with the dif-
ficulty the cultures of the world will be lowered
in the next few centuries to the level of the hunt-
ing tribes who inhabited the earth tens of thou-
sands of years ago and who fled from the ice close
on the heels of the animals since from them alone
could be obtained food and clothing

  it is inconceivable that all this civilization
should again sink to barbarism said elizabeth
looking into the clear serious eyes of the german
with something like fear

  and yet it will happen our desperate clinging
to the hope that some wonder will save us only
shows how inadequate a conception we have of our
position in the universe think-the universe as
we see it contains approximately  solar
systems like ours according to the latest figures
assuming an average of ten planets to each sun
we have two and a half billion earths in so much
of the universe as is visible to us how many of
them are inhabited we do not know but certainly
many millions apples on which bacteria live
how little we care if in some huge californian orch-
ard an apple is destroyed and the bacteria on its
shrinking skin die out so little difference does
the drowning in ice of one of her millions of in-
habited globes make to mother nature

  i feel you are right mr baumgart you have
the correct perspective my god how insignificant
we are and how foolish to think of our little star
as important

  just so miss hawthorn and yet there are
possibilities for the salvation of humanity its
getting late dont you think and im afraid i have
been confusing you by diving into the complex
regions of speculation in which i move perhaps
your father will tell you some more of my plans
tomorrow morning

  with the greatest of pleasure if you will per-
mit it now lets empty one more bottle before we
turn in mr baumgart

  elizabeth rose she knew that her father liked
to spend the final hour of the evening over a glass

of wine and a good cigar with his guests she
patted the hand of the old man and bade him good
night as baumgart accepted her extended hand
she looked into his eyes which had taken on their
usual dreamy look and again both were overcome
by a slight feeling of gaucherie

  an hour later the german went to his room a
few of the appointments had been changed in a
place formerly occupied by an aquatint of table
mountain was now filled by a head of goethe in a
dark frame and a german edition of faust lay
on the table

  the trees rustled outside the southern cross
gleamed among the branches johannes baumgart
looked up at the constellation never seen by a
northlander-how far away lay his home and yet
in spirit how near his hand caressed the binding
of the yellowed old book anna louise lindner
karlsruhe may   in memory of a visit to
weimar could be made out in faded letters on the
flyleaf probably an inheritance from elizabeths
grandmother he opened the book at random and
read the first lines that met his eye

  at the same moment elizabeth hawthorn was
standing before a tall cheval-glass appraising her
own features with care for the first time in her life

chapter v

the coming of the nebula

rp o call the cape of good hope where the bold
i bartolomeo diaz was wrecked in the year i
the most southerly point of the african continent
is strictly speaking not quite accurate cape
agulhas the needle-cape lies more than twenty-
five miles farther south this is the last outpost
of the continent once called dark

  what distinguished the cape of good hope is its
nearness to the ancient settlement which had now
become one of the worlds largest cities-cape
town at one end of the ragged tongue of land
scarcely thirty miles in length which sticks out into
the ocean lies the cape where the caravels of diaz
whipped by the storm rolled by

  the peninsula stands out from the land at the
end of semicircular table bay around which is
placed the forest of houses which is cape town
before it to the north lies the open sea behind it
rises the dark mass of table mountain with dev-
ils peak and lions head the city itself lies on a
dry sandy plain which runs back on the southeast
into extensive groves where slender birches and
widespread oaks rear their heads side by side with
eucalyptus

  the wonderful anchorage of table bay gave the
region its importance warm breezes from the at-
lantic blow across it and the mountains in the
south keep it from the chilly airs of the south pole

  at this point celebrated in the history of the
southern hemisphere the english government
which once upon a time had jurisdiction over land
in south north east and west had built an observa-
tory it was the first one south of the equator and
proved a necessity for the observation of comets
and other phenomena that had escaped the teles-
copes of the north thus in the year  the ob-
servatory of the cape of good hope came into exis-
	wonder stories quarterly

tence under the direction of the astronomer hen-
derson it was located four miles from the heart
of the city out in the plain at a latitude of  w
and a longitude of  

  important astronomical work had long been done
there the distance of capella was measured the
great photographic sky-map was born here careful
determinations of the distance of sun and moon
were made and many similar works of scientific
importance performed later sir john herschel
the famous son of a famous father brought his
mighty telescope from england to cape town and
began his extensive investigations of the southern
skies hitherto almost inaccessible to research from
the foot of table mountain

  ever more powerful instruments were installed
in the course of the ensuing centuries until in the
year  the spreading city began to hinder the
observatorys labors millions were expended on
a new observatory located on table mountain it-
self in the midst of a grove of oaks and birches
it consisted of several buildings and was construct-
ed on such a scale as to throw all other observa-
tories even the gigantic establishments of america
into the shade the most delicate measuring in-
struments and the hugest telescopes permitted by
the technical knowledge of the age were part of its
equipment

  thus the cape of good hope observatory became
the greatest astronomical workshop of the earth
with an enormous staff of astronomers and assist-
ants

  it was here that a discovery which was to become
important to all the people of the earth was made
even those to whom the wonderful empire of the
stars meant nothing

  it was on july   about midnight that the
astronomer adam svendenham observed through
one of his gigantic telescopes the region south of
the star gamma in the constellation hercules a
multitude of tiny stars never visible to the unaided
eye became visible through the huge instrument
through the barrel of which one could have driven
a ford a tiny luminous cloud attracted the at-
tention of sir adam svendenham it floated far
away in space and was so feebly illuminated that
even through his powerful instrument it was
scarcely visible he referred to the astronomical
reports studied the star catalogs but found in none
of them any mention of the little luminous cloud

  but of course there were thousands of such
clouds in the depths of space they hang at im-
measurable distances from our system farther
away than most of the stars that sparkle in the
sky of night astronomers call them nebulae they
are composed of gases and dust particles and are
of such immense size that compared with the least
of them the solar system with all its planets
shrinks to the dimensions of a toy

  when svendenham appeared in the calculation
department where a small army of mathematicians
was at work he entered the newly formed nebula
on the sky map and reported the discovery to the
head of the observatory sir frederick gill and
with that the not very important discovery seemed
to have reached its conclusion a new comet would
have been far more welcome to svendenham as
well as to his chief neither of them had any con-

ception how important a discovery had tieen made

in the old cape observatory

again in april  the same region in her-
cules was swept with the telescope when
svendenham observed it he noted at once that the
location and size of the nebula were considerably
altered he took a new photograph of the whole
section and these two dispassionate documents the
old and the new plates gave evidence that the nebu-
la was travelling through the universe with con-
siderable speed and was approaching the solar sys-
tem the astronomers of the cape observatory
became aroused reports and pictures from the fam-
ous institution stirred other astronomers through-
out the earth into action all telescopes were
turned on the nebula every instrument sought to
establish its location with the utmost accuracy and
all the apparatus for stellar photography in obser-
vatories went into action

  no doubt of it-here was a huge cosmic cloud
approaching the earth all other known nebulae
had remained practically motionless in their celes-
tial positions since discovery it was possible that
they too moved but the motion was imperceptible
because of the enormous distances that separated
them from the sun this helped the proof that the
famous svendenham nebula as they called it must
be unusually close-though close to astronomers
is a word of singular meaning they consider the
sun close to us though it would take a bullet
about ten years to reach it from the earth

  now the most accurate instruments in the obser-
vatories were set to work to obtain for the mathe-
maticians a basis from which to determine the dis-
tance of the mysterious cloud the result of years
of measurement calculation and deduction was to
enable the international astronomical congress of
buenos ayres to make the following statement

the svendenham nebula

  on the basis of all observations and calculations
the following data on the nebula have been estab-
lished relative to january   location of the
nebula in the skies eight ascension  h  m
declination  north that is between the stars
gamma and kappa in the constellation hercules
it covers  seconds of arc the distance of the
nebula from earth and sun must be estimated at
 million kilometers its distance is there-
fore  astronomical units

  the orbit of the nebula at the present time
brings it in almost a straight line in the direction
of our solar system spectroanalytical measure-
ments on the doppler principle gives the conclusion
that it is approaching our system at a speed of 
kilometers per second as our solar system is
noving toward the star delta herculei the sun with
all its planets is hurrying away from the nebula
at the known velocity of  kilometers per second
the true rate of the clouds approach to us may
therefore be established at  kilometers a second

  from these data we conclude that at the expira-
tion of  years the nebula and solar system must
meet provided both bodies retain their present
direction and velocity of motion this is certainly
true with regard to our solar system but further
observations will be necessary to establish it with
the cosmic cloud	

regard to the cloud if it proves correct our solar
system must in the year  collide with the
nebula

  the nebula is at present poorly illuminated and
so blurred that we can see only its brighter central
area this has a diameter of  seconds of arc
in consideration of the distance mentioned above
the cloud therefore has a width of approximately
 million kilometers but since its edges lose their
visibility in space we must count on an actual
width of from four to five times this figure it is
safe to estimate it at approximately one billion
kilometers which is more than triple the diameter
of the earths orbit

  a chain of small light-knots within the cloud
shows that the cloud extends into space for a con-
siderable distance as they lie behind each other
and the narrowest portion of the nebula is directed
toward us it seems that behind the cloud certain
matter perhaps disgorged from the main mass is
in motion so that the total extent of the nebula is
very difficult to estimate and similarly the time
necessary for our solar system to pass through the
cloud cannot be predicted with accuracy it may
take decades or centuries according to the true di-
mensions of the mass

  spectroscopic observation proves that the nebu-
la consists of very finely divided material met-
eorological dust and hydrogen gas have been iden-
tified as components

when these facts became known to the scienti-
fic world they caused boundless excitement
and still greater was the tumult when the report
was interpreted to the public through thousands of
newspapers and periodicals

  the subject was discussed in every scientific and
popular magazine all newspapers printed pic-
tures of the strange nebula excited discussion as to
whether the astronomical calculations could be con-
sidered accurate took place and speculation serious
and fantastic on the possible consequences of the
coming collision abounded

  for years the opinions warred throughout the
scientific world and were reflected in the distorted
rumors that circulated among the unscientific mass-
es the end of the world was freely predicted
revivalists used the event to drag people into their
tents the hydrogen some said would ignite on
the sun and send all the planets off in an immense
blaze of fireworks the dust would suffocate hu-
manity cover the earth miles deep prophesied oth-
ers a swedish scientist was of the opinion that
the earth would be heated like a bullet driving
through sand as it penetrated the mass of dust

  our planet might very easily become white-hot
he said the italian astronomer cangrani gave
birth to the hypothesis that the friction caused by
the masses of dust would slow the earth down in
its orbit around the sun from this we might in-
duce he declared that in accordance with the laws
of celestial mechanics the earth would approach
the sun in a spiral soon reaching the orbit of
venus the effect of which would be so considerable

an increase in temperature that the poles alone
would be inhabitable and they would be warmer
than central africa

  on the other hand a group of scientists came to
the conclusion that the most probable result was
that the dust would produce the opposite effect
the veil of dust would be too thin considerably to
hinder the motion of the earth since the small stars
behind the cloud were clearly visible through it
the dust in fact would absorb so great a part of
the suns radiation that our planet must become
colder

  this opinion came to be more and more generally
accepted and it remained for the future to demon-
strate that it was correct a swiss geologist an-
ton zussli of berne was the first to point out that
very likely a similar occurrence had caused the ice
age which had glaciated vast tracts of the earth
forty thousand years before

  thus was the question discussed through all the
papers of the world for a decade the comic pap-
ers were of course not behind the rest they pic-
tured the earth as an old lady accompanied by a
bull terrier the moon they showed her hurry-
ing through a thick dust-cloud which was the re-
sult of a cart being driven along a country road
a grinning devil was shown sitting at the tail of
the cart shouting insults at the old lady

  the subject became the butt of the stage the
vaudeville show and street songs until the coming
of more immediate interests caused public excite-
ment over the nebula to die five hundred years
away people said my god thats a long time to
wait apres nous la deluge

  in the world of science however the question
was not so easily shelved astronomers deal habi-
tually in huge figures and immense stretches of
time and to them the thrill of the event was not
lessened by the fact that the solar system would
not enter the svendenham nebula for another five
hundred years

  a special committee for the observation of the
nebula had been named the observatories of cape
town madras milan potsdam yokohama san-
tiago chile and the lick observatory of califor-
nia were entrusted with the task of watching the
cloud

  the correlation of the gathered data was placed
in the hands of the cape town observatory by way
of compliment to the body that had made the dis-
covery

  meanwhile time ran its even course indifferent
to human measuring rods and human history five
hundred years  like a fugitive pulse-beat in
the vast evolutionary process of nature in ten to
twelve thousand years human history can be traced
far back beyond the point where the babylonians
first began to build their mud huts and the earliest
cultures developed at the foot of the himalaya
massif

  the most reliable data show that man has lived
upon the earth for eight hundred thousand years
and twenty-five millions of years have gone by since
the time when those forests whose petrified remains
now being dragged to light in the form of coal were
green in the land and if one counts back to the
days when the planet itself was a glowing ball the
stretch of time is quite beyond the imagination
	wonder stories quarterly

  for aeons the earth had been flying through
space a diminutive companion of the sun for tens
of thousands of years the cloud had wandered
through the universe from depth to depth now
by chance it was brought into the immediate proxi-
mity of the sun

  time rolled on the solar system and the cloud
raced through space but on the earth generation
succeeded generation svendenham was long dead
and the men who had conducted the first investiga-
tions on this strange cloud had also sunk to their
last rest still with improved instruments and
methods astronomers sought to pierce the myster-
ies of the skies above all the approaching cloud
and the archives of the cape observatory were
piled deep with measurements photos and spectro-
scopic investigations of the stranger

growing desolation

it was eighty years after its discovery in the year
 when the nebula became visible to ordin-
ary telescopes it appeared near gamma herculei
like a blurred chalk-mark on a blackboard the
flame of interest received new fuel once again the
whole world was aroused by the thought of the
svendenham nebula and what fate it brought for
the earth at this time it appeared that the data
originally calculated by the committee were on
the whole correct particularly with regard to the
distance of the cloud it also became beyond doubt
that it had retained its original direction and speed
of movement-in other words that the solar system
and the cloud were certain to collide

  on the other hand the earlier estimates of the
clouds dimensions had to be thoroughly rectified
as it grew more distinctly visible it became pos-
sible to determine its true size new thickened
areas gave a further means of estimates the outer-
most lay at a distance now estimated at  million
million kilometers but since the front of the cloud
had covered twenty-two and a half billion kilomet-
ers in the past eighty years and had at that time
been  million million kilometers away from the
solar system it appeared that the cloud had the
enormous length of  million million kilometers
should the solar system pass through its longer
axis it would remain in the cloud for  years

  the width of the cloud could now be calculated
with some accuracy at  billion kilometers

   in estimating the size of the nebula the old cal-
culators had made grave errors as is evident from
a comparison of the figures they had placed the
size of the cloud at too low a figure a fact expli-
cable by reason of the invisibility of its more dis-
tant parts at the time the calculations were made

  much though these huge figures amazed the gen-
eral public there was nothing in them to perplex
astronomers since the nebula in orion is at a con-
servative estimate at least twice this size never-
theless there was considerable pessimism in certain
circles with regard to the future of life in consid-
eration of the fact that our planet would have to
plunge into this dust-bath for two thousand five
hundred years

in the first centuries this state of mind had given

way before the problems that occupied humanity
more urgently great political upheavals had tak-
en place a hundred years before the arrival of
the cloud a feeling of panic swept through the
population much damage resulted the russian
astronomer mikhailow thought himself justified in
setting the arrival of the cloud only a few years
ahead and his articles filled tortured humanity
with rage and fear

  once more the date for the end of the world was
set in the immediate future once more a huge
wave of pessimism ran round the world new reli-
gions sprang up everywhere all with a single ob-
ject-that of buying gods favor in the last days
with self-immolation the number of those who
sought to escape the horrors to come through sui-
cide increased with such rapidity that all govern-
ments embarked upon a vigorous campaign of edu-
cation this was undertaken in a thorough effi-
cient and cold-blooded spirit as a matter of ex-
pediency

  every government had treatises on everything
in connection with the cloud produced by its most
expert scientists these articles were written on
the level of comprehension of the masses and mil-
lions of copies were distributed in them the men
of learning made it clear that the impact of the
cloud which was very thin would never be felt at
all and that only very slowly in the course of cen-
turies could any climate change come about at
that time it would take the form of a drop in tem-
perature with the effects of which the united
forces of modern science would certainly be able to
cope

  nor did the campaign of education end here in
the elementary schools the subject was freely dis-
cussed and the growing generation made thorough-
ly familiar with its implications all moving pic-
ture theatres were compelled to show at least once
a year a film on the svendenham nebula which
showed the nebula itself its approach its contact
with the earth and its anything but destructive
effects

  thanks to these intensive methods the public re-
gained a measure of its confidence and the coming
days were awaited without further manifestations
of fear

  the first traces of the approaching cloud were
observed in the year  five years before the
calculations of gill branvill schiinemann of 
had predicted

  in the spring of that year nature lovers enjoyed
the most fascinating sunsets they had ever seen
the sun went to his rest enveloped in a wide purple
mantle far into the twilight a faint rosy colora-
tion hung in the zenith through which the stars
blinked greenly like splinters of emerald red and
orange clouds of dust floated far up in the skies as
late as midnight and measures of their altitude
showed them to be a hundred miles above the earth
and therefore at heights never reached by the or-
dinary clouds of water vapor the most lofty of
which attain only seven and a half miles

  they could only be masses of microcosmic dust
drifting through the ether and creating the won-
derful color effects through deflection of sunlight

  at times volcanoes had been known to throw
such masses of dust and ash into the air as to
the cosmic cloud	

produce a similar effect the monstrous explosion
of krakatoa in the straits of sunda in  had
brought about the most beautiful sunsets that hu-
man eyes had seen before this time but now there
was no volcano and there was no the slightest doubt
that the masses of cloud originated in the sven-
denham nebula

  the nebula itself was no longer visible in the
skies at night on approaching the sun it had at
first become brighter and brighter but its light
decreased as it became more extensive and when
it finally occupied the whole sky the light was so
diffused that it no longer made any impression
only its more distant contours and the thicker
knots were seen as irregular luminous spots of the
size of the moon

the cloud the much-feared cloud the thought of
which five hundred years before had thrown
the world into a panic of anxiety or silent care had
at last arrived thus far it was merely a perfectly
harmless visitor from astral space which traced
colored ribbons across the skies laid a shimmering
mantle of purple around the earth which became
the delight of all those who commune with nature
on warm summer nights

  naturally careful investigations on the compo-
sitions of the clouds substance were begun at once
whale-hunters and seamen whose activities carried
them to the polar regions reported a few years
later that vast areas of snow had taken on a rusty-
brown color a committee of chemists was sent
from finland to the polar wastes they collected
samples of the snow melted it down and analyzed
it the evidence showed that the coloration had
been caused by the presence of finely-divided iron
dust it detail analysis showed that the dust con-
tained  iron  nickel  silicates 
limestone and traces of alumina and magnesia
the same result was obtained when balloons carry-
ing evacuated vessels were sent to high altitudes
and there opened automatically to take in samples
of the air and dust such tests showed a small
amount of hydrogen present in addition to the other
elements thus was it proved that the dust-cloud
consisted of the same general components as met-
eoric dust which as is well known penetrates our
atmosphere in great quantities

  the cloud proper was no longer visible aside
from a slight illumination of the nightly sky visible
only to the experienced eye and the twilight effects
produced by the dust evidently the cloud was not
throughout of equal density since after a few dec-
ades a distinct dimming of the sun occurred a
swimming halo surrounded the star of day and his
light became singularly turgid such occurrences
which were repeated at intervals naturally created
a certain state of public anxiety but they passed
without damage

  beyond doubt there was a slight decrease in the
euns radiation it was detected by numerous in-
struments and evidence from meteorological sta-
tions spread over a period of years soon showed
evidence of a slight but distinct drop in the aver-
age yearly temperature this had been  degrees
in europe for thousands of years ten years after
the first contact with the cloud it had already

dropped to  degrees and kept on falling slowly

but measurably

  an increase in the precipitation manifested it-
self with greater distinctness in the temperate
zones tenacious fogs which were a particular handi-
cap to navigation became a customary occurrence
it had been known for a long time that such fogs
occurred only when very fine dust particles were
floating in an air saturated with water vapor the
redoubtable london fog originates in the immense
quantities of tiny coal particles expelled into the
air by innumerable factory chimneys and locomo-
tives and gathers vapor from the nearby ocean
even raindrops and frost-crystals require for their
formation such a condensation nucleus of dust
small wonder then that with the entire atmos-
phere deluged with dust rain and snow increased
beyond their old limits

  as it became colder the snow predominated in
the more elevated regions of the north and south
of the earth it was no longer melted away by
the sun as of old but capped every mountain no
matter how small and was compressed through its
own weight into ice naturally this ice could not
grow into the sky it moved down into the valleys
in the form of glaciers thus the glaciers wan-
dered farther and farther south from their homes
the icebergs in the oceans became more numerous
and increased in size

  grave cases of shipwreck made the utmost care
in navigation necessary in the course of centur-
ies in short it became clear that the svendenham
clbud which at first seemed so harmless had be-
come a distinct menace to human life this was
particularly evident in scandinavia and other sub-
polar regions as they became quite uninhabitable
on account of the increasing ice-caps or could be
called inhabitable only to the extent that hunting
and nomad peoples alone could sustain life there
northern cities of once-great importance were de-
serted  the population streamed southward

  the land under tillage in europe northern asia
and north america decreased until finally only a
united effort by all the governments of the earth
could avert a truly pitiable famine

  the cloud had come the earth had been flying
through its dust-masses for centuries with express-
train speed but the condition was to continue ac-
cording to the astronomers for thousands of years
more what would the harvest be

          a great observatory

for twenty minutes benjamin graachten had
been standing motionless in the impenetrable
darkness under the great metallic dome even the
tiny point of light at the end of his cigarette had
been shielded by his hand for he knew that these
astronomers particularly old rawlinson were apt
to become irritable when an unexpected ray of
light disturbed the eyes that sought to spy out the
secrets of the universe

  the famous editor-in-chief shifted his weight
from one foot to the other leaned against a pillar
and shivered when a gust from the aperture in the
dome struck him
	wonder stories quarterly

  all he could see was a slender ribbon of night-
sky thinly ornamented with stars-the only sector
of the heavens visible and this visible because it
could be seen through the slot where the huge tele-
scope looked out into space the instrument stood
out in the half-light a feeble silhouette beneath
which the darkness was stygian

  only a few minutes more mr graachten and
well have something for you

  dont let me disturb you i know from exper-
ience that youll be more amiable later

magneto of the chronograph would rattle as it re-
corded the time-signals from the man at the teles-
cope on a revolving band and the soft hum of the
electric clockwork as it kept the huge instrument
in step with the motion of the stars formed a back-
ground for the tone-picture

  well mr graachten i have finished the meas-
urements as long as you have invaded the top
of table mountain in the middle of the night you
may as well see something interesting come here
and look into the glass

iruslraic by paul

the sun went to his rest enveloped in
a wide purple mantle far into the
twilight a faint rosy coloration
hung in the zenith

  an inarticulate murmur came from the base of
the telescope

  benjamin graachten lit a new cigarette from
the butt of the old one being careful that no light
escaped

  he pricked his ears to catch the tiny noises in the
dark

  behind him in the chronometer room the enor-
mous second-clock which missed the true time by
scarcely a tenth of a second in a month ticked
away in unending monotony now and then the

  my dear mr rawlinson that is easier said than
done i can see neither your famous person nor
the end of the telescope in this cimmerian dark-
ness

  im sorry i cant make a light but if i did you
wouldnt be able to see anything afterward try
to follow the sound of my voice and i will give you
a hand

  benjamin graachten felt his way along with out-
stretched hands until he touched fingers with the
famous astronomer
the cosmic cloud	

 now sit down in this seat careful right
 over your face is the eye-piece feel of this thing
 here now look

 i see nothing but a few tiny stars

 to the left you can see a dim irregular light

 i dont see it

 well my dear man if it were as simple as that
 now strain your famous journalistic eyes which
 can usually see through a stone wall on this spot
 beside the stars

 ten thousand devils i cant see a thing and
 im surprised that your immense sky-cannon gives
 you so little to look at

 it all depends what youre shooting at if the
 moon were in its range now you could see every
 rock in its craters but this is a very different
 object-namely the last outrider of the nebula a
 dim little cloud of light ought to be visible

 wait i think i see it-a spindle-shaped bit of
 light

 right you are

 and so this is the outermost border of the cloud
 which is driving us all to gehenna

 just so when our solar system reaches this
 part of the cloud our ice-age will end or rather the
 end will begin

 when will that happen

 according to my latest calculation in the year
  in other words  years from now

 good god my dear rawlinson do you length-
 en the time every day

 yes my dear mr graachten if that is too
 long for you join the party of my eternal rival
 abdul ben-haffa of the cairo observatory who cal-
 culates only  years for the duration of the
 nebula how he arrives at that figure is obscure
 to me

 a few years less makes very little difference to
 me if for no other reason because you are a neigh-
 bor of mine ill swear by your figures

 the old astronomer laughed very nice of you
 im sure

 not at all what will a man not do in the in-
 terest of his home town to the devil with abdul
 ben-haffa

 dont lets talk about him its the one subject
 on which i have strong feelings he is trying to
 rob me of my hard-earned reputation as the first
 astronomer of the country evidently he can
 hardly wait till i pass away in fact merely men-
 tioning his name does considerable damage to my
 seventy year-old heart

 he is said to be far less accurate than his as-
 sistant mr voorthuizen who is the descendant of
 a long line of dutch scientists

 rawlinson growled something into his patriarch-
 al beard if you will permit i will turn on the
 light now and well find some place more comfor-
 table than this draughty dome to talk

 by all means im stiff already it astonishes
 me that you at your age can spend hours lying in
 your seat

 well you just cant heat observatories

 the electric lights went on

 benjamin graachten could recognize ob-
 jects about him he was more lying than cit-
 ting in the comfortable seat above him the tube

 reared its immense head eighty feet up to qe aper-
 ture in the huge metal dome a disorderly array
 of small telescopes beams balancing weights lev-
 ers and compasses gleamed in the light

  by the holy chinchinchindra of calcutta here
i lie under this monster like an ant under a mans
shoe if the structure up there were to come
loose  

  then the african herald would lose its head
dont you ever get scared lying for hours under
this thing it must have an enormous weight

  a good four hundred tons the lens alone
weighs tons but dont you worry the axles are as
thick as a century-old oak and hold the glass un-
shakably in its place

  have you heard that your rival in cairo is go-
ing to build a monster new instrument a tele-
scope of an entirely new type

  i have heard rumors

  how wide is your lens

  three hundred and eighty inches

  the new instrument is to have a mirror of 
inches

  that makes me laugh its an impossibility
well my dear mr rawlinson theyre already
at work they are building it in secret the in-
strument is an entirely new invention new design
and all it will surprise the whole world the
idea originated with voorthuizen and the engin-
eers say it will be surprisingly effective

  and i say i dont believe it growled the old
man irritably

  rawlinson who was referred to by his fellow
scientist abdul ben-haffa as an outmoded prima
donna slouched across the observatory in his furs
to the mechanism which closed the observation
aperture the shutter creaked across the opening
the old man had a magnificent head a white mane
joined with the long wavy beard that flowed like
a waterfall over his dark fur he led the way
through the chronometer room to his well-heated
office

  make yourself at home mr graachten here
are cigarettes over there is tea and wine take
whichever you like now tell me what brought
you to table mountain in the middle of the night
thank you its rather late now so ill confine
myself to a brief narration do you know a ger-
man scientist by the name of johannes baumgart
baumgart johannes baumgart seems to me
i have heard the name baumgart wait yes-a
work in several volumes got a good deal of atten-
tion some little time ago i know it only in part
however at any rate he has a reputation in the
scientific world

  so you think him a man to be taken seriously
  unquestionably

  tell me mr rawlinson do you think a flight to
the moon at all possible

  my dear mr graachten i hope you havent
climbed table mountain in the middle of the night
to tell me fairy-tales good old jules verne has
been dead for more than a thousand years and
the frenchman bourquin who tried to fly to the
moon more than two hundred and fifty years
ago-

  dropped from a considerable altitude into the
ocean and was never found i know about it but
	wonder stories quarterly

this german scientist wants to repeat the french-
mans attempt with better means

  this baumgart

  the same

  well i think its a fantastic idea the fact
that a scientist blew his soap-bubble doesnt make
it any more substantial

  since bourquins attempt two hundred and fif-
ty years have elapsed and we have made pro-
gress-

  but gravitation still remains

  what do you mean by that

  my dear graachten the fuel necessary to pro-
pel a rocket ship to the moon is truly enormous and
only a rocket ship can do it

  no doubt

  good then you will understand that none of
our airplanes could move through space since it
is as much as the bell out of which i pump all the
air you see the air becomes so thin at an altitude
of  feet that our respiratory organs wont
work and at a distance of fifty miles from the
surface there are only minute traces of the gaseous
element left quite insufficient to support even the
daintiest butterfly when you get farther out
there is not an iota of air from such a vacuum
any airplane would drop to the earth like a stone
and our rockets do not possess sufficiently powerful
fuel is this clear to you

  it is very likely you are right mr rawlinson
lets leave the subject and attack another do you
believe that the moon is inhabited

  my dear graachten you are really delightful
tonight there is not the slightest doubt that it
is not inhabited as there is no longer any air or
water on the moon

  you know that your friend at cairo holds the
opposite opinion and claims to have discovered dis-
tinct evidences of something like an atmosphere
and traces of either ice or rime which he claims
cause a vague fog along the edges of the craters
at sunrise

t rphis ben-haffa opposes me in everything and
x anything if i said today the moon was
inhabited he would say tomorrow that it was not
the giant telescope being built up there will set
all doubt on those points at rest

  go on rawlinson patted a pile of books irrit-
ably

  do you believe that the moon was inhabited at
one time

  that also i am inclined to doubt traces of
human activity could hardly have escaped our big
telescopes nothing of the sort has been discov-
ered thus far though some of the formations might
be called curious but for other reasons also i
doubt that a highly-developed race could have
evolved on the moon the time available was hard-
ly sufficient the moon died too young in a sense-
lost its atmosphere all too soon on earth it was
innumerable millions of years before nature reach-
ed the point where she could produce man the
same span of time was not offered to the short-liv-
ing world of the moon

  this mr baumgart holds the opposite opinion
he wants to explore the place and make use of the

experience of the moons inhabitants in solving our
problems

  what an idea 

  you will be able to read the details in our paper
this german wants to use the experience of the
lunarites with their dying globe to help us out in
our ice-age

  a very queer idea i must say

  hes going to ask the government to back his
project

  and i shall certainly warn them against such
butterfly-chasing in the first place the journey
will be a failure but that is for the engineers and
technologists to work out and does not concern me

  secondly the moon never was inhabited and is
not now there is no information to be had from
it and thirdly nobody could succeed in staying
there for any length of time even if he did succeed
in reaching it i think these reasons would be suf-
ficient to dissuade our government from staking
human lives on such an enterprise not to speak of
the energy and money involved

  will you permit me to put this opinion in print
in a little follow-up to the story of baumgarts
plans

  i urge you to do so

  many thanks mr rawlinson and now i will
cease robbing you of your nights repose if astron-
omers ever repose at night

  thats all right good night oh yes-one
more thing if you hear anything about the plans
of the people in cairo-you know about the new
telescope-please keep me informed we all have
our curiosity you know

  benjamin graachten did know he bade the as-
tronomer good-night and walked on through the
wide park annexed to the observatory in some of
the buildings of which people were still working
the old man is really a little out of date he
thought and brim-full of jealousy of everything
that doesnt come from his own sky-factory

  at the base of the mountain he found his car
waiting for him and whirled away i must be
careful not to let rawlinsons disapproval get into
our editorial point of view one never can tell
how things will come out and in any case it will be
sensational news for the present i had better
keep two strings to my bow

  he lighted a cigarette and smiled slyly as he
made the journey to town an hour later he had
dictated the interview with rawlinson and in an-
other hour the tireless editor was racing from the
roof of the herald building toward zanzibar in his
airplane	

chapter viii

a great assembly

the brilliant morning sun shone on the myriad
roofs of zanzibar the fresh breeze promised
a comfortable temperature for the day particularly
welcome since thousands of delegates a countless
number of government officials and all their re-
tinue were to convene that day streaming in from
the four quarters of the continent

  it was a red-letter day for this seat of govern-
ment and administration of the united states of
the cosmic cloud	

africa with its elaborate office buildings wide
neatly-landscaped parkways and its glassy-smooth
avenues even in the early morning they were
filled with numberless pedestrians crowded transit
lines and racing automobiles

  a special message of the president had summon-
ed the high council and the legislative bodies-
parliament and senate-for extraordinary session
important questions were to be decided africa
had volunteered to extend a helping hand to the
menaced population of europe the other great
nations of the world were occupied with starting
relief plans for northern asia north america and
the southern tip of the south american continent

  but before the delegates now there lay the ques-
tion of africas own future for here and there the
climatic effects of the coming ice-age had made
themselves manifest the task before them was
a probing to the very bottom of the situation and
devising some relief measure that would be more
than temporary

  from the great ports of bagamojo saadani
pangani and dar-es-salaam swift electric ferries
were arriving at the harbor of zanzibar and air-
ship after airship dropped like tired birds to the
level of the great airport of bagamojo beyond the
canal senators members of parliament counsel-
lors ambassadors journalists and scientific ex-
perts were arriving at their destination

  at the crest of the gentle slope the imposing gov-
ernment palace rose above a cobweb of broad ave-
nues its magnificent dome composed of gilded
plates and green glazed tiles glittered afar in the
sunlight at its peak waved the black and white
flag with the cross and the crescent a perfect
forest of tropical plants surrounded the majestic
stone halls like a green wreath a huge flood of
people passed ceaselessly up and down the wide
stone steps that led to the entrance the waters
of a huge fountain tossed rainbow-jewels in the
air the breeze blowing its top out into a dim veil
of silvery drops at one side of it stood the bronze
head of africas first president van der valk who
had four centuries before surmounted the last
difficulties that stood in the way of a union of the
peoples of the continent

  great throngs crowded the square to watch the
arrival of the officials and the foreign ambassadors
hardly a single policeman was to be seen respect
for the laws they had made was one of the moat
deeply-rooted instincts of this essentially social
people

  a plain dark car the black-painted sides of which
were polished to the last degree was stopping at
the foot of the stairway the chaffeur descended
to open the door an old gentleman clean-shaven
his fresh ruddy face framed in a white halo of
hair was visible slightly bent and leaning on the
support of his cane he proceeded slowly toward
the stairway the bystanders uncovered with here
and there a word of greeting for the old gentleman
who thanked his well-wishers with a friendly smile
as he ascended the stairs

  who is it

  that my son is his excellency cornelius van
zuylen the president of our country now see that
gentleman over there-the one with the big brief-
case and the dark brown face he is the chief

representative of the native peoples of the center
of our country senator umararu and the lady be-
hind him is a delegate from the littoral district
tripolis mme birrha

  there was a sharp rattling sound in the distance
a wave of motion swept over the spectators and all
heads were uplifted a glittering shape plowed
through the air from the north with lightening
speed rapidly gaining size as it approached

  look there no-there above the roof its
one of the new rocket planes the other day a big
one which had been visiting polar europe came
over see how it is dropping down toward the
bagamojo airport notice the long chain of smoke-
puffs behind it

  a group of ladies stood beside the great foun-
tain they were mostly foreigners watching the
interesting spectacle of the government of a con-
tinent in session the social secretary of one of
the big hotels was acting as their guide

  your attention ladies here is something of
particular interest to you a car of the newest
design painted a deep red was racing across the
plaza in a bold curve it pulled up abruptly at the
foot of the long stairway a lady was at the wheel
she leaped out and accepted a dainty brief case
from the hand of a young girl whom she assisted
out

all eyes were turned toward the new arrival
who had driven her own machine and mur-
murs went through the assembly the features of
the feminine spectators brightened in smiles of
satisfaction

  do you know who this is ladies asked the
social secretary of his party the most important
woman-member of the senate mme khadija eff-
rem-latour she is from the nilotic zone-a beau-
ty of the first order and at the same time one of
the countrys most brilliant women

  evidently not a lady of european descent since
that coal-black hair those flashing eyes that bronze
complexion-

  right you are mme effrem-latour as the
name suggests is of arabic descent on her fathers
side he was mayor of alexandria for some time
her mother mme latour was from southern
france

  what a splendid figure that finely-chiselled
nose and what grace

  and yet every movement full of energy her
eyes are so clear and penetrating the lady she is
speaking to is her secretary i believe

  exactly incidentally mme effrem-latour is
barely twenty-nine and in spite of her remarkable
beauty has never acquired a husband im afraid
shes too clever and energetic for us men

  the ladies laughed

  that may very well be an elderly american
woman said with a significant glance the beard-
wearing section of humanity dont go in much for
her type

  moreover she is a remarkable debater every-
one is agreed that she is a wonderful orator she
is usually in opposition and she is her fathers own
daughter she stands particularly for the interests
of the mohammedan population

  very interesting
	wonder stories quarterly

  especially amusing have been her debates with
sir archibald plug hes an old ea-dog with a
crude sense of humor who is not at all afraid of
the madam with the beautiful eyes and the sharp
claws the other day a comic paper ran a carica-
ture of the two showing them as a dog and a cat
both pulling opposite ways on a big fish

  the interesting figure of the lady legislator had
long since disappeared through the lofty portals
of the government palace new arrivals claimed
attention rubicund ismail chak mr praga re-
presentative of the united states of europe tian
lung ambassador from the chinese republic mr
blackburne envoy from the united states of am-
erica-and hundreds of other male and female re-
presentatives famous scientists and well-known
newspaper men followed each other up the stairs
the crowd had an air of festival gaiety the sun
climbed higher and higher in its path the fountain
turned to a shower of molten silver and the high
dome of gold and stone shone magically across the
whole scene

	 

  every place in the huge parliament hall was
filled an excited buzz of conversation ran
through it compared to the already depressing
heat in the streets the temperature in the room
was cool a current of air supplied by a con-
cealed refrigerating system ran through the place
through the skylight composed of thousands of
prisms many-toned light penetrated to the most re-
mote corners of the auditorium around the walls
among the leaves of tall plants the marble busts
of the great men of africas past looked down upon
the assemblage

  in the foreground on a little dais was the
bronze seat of the president upholstered in red
velvet above it hung the great standard of the
country singularly impressive with its cross and
crescent formed of living jewels on a black and
white background of silk right and left stood
the ministerial tables before them the seats of the
senators and councillors and in widening circles
behind them the seats of the members of parlia-
ment

  in the boxes at either side were the seats of the
ambassadors and journalists and the balconies
above groaned with the weight of the spectators

  all these and countless thousands more the
seats of the representatives were arranged neither
by political nor territorial divisions but mingled
together with intentional disorder the older ar-
rangement by parties was considered primitive
every member was expected to vote on measures
without the party influence

the golden hand of the great clock reached the
hour at that moment doors in the back of
the hall opened and the ministers filed to their seats
it was ten oclock the extraordinary session was
opened a moment later wreaths of green lights
rto the right and left of the standard burst into
luminosity his excellency cornelius van zuylen
the president stepped out of a little niche bowing
his snowy head to one side and the other as he
passed to his seat

a sudden silence fell on the hall everyone rose

a moment later a hundred boys and girls dressed

in white and with green wreaths in their hair ap-
peared on the dais they had entered in silence
and showed every variation of color from purest
white to deepest ebony they were orphans from
all parte of the great continent gathered to per-
sonify the union of the peoples-the fraternal idea
on which the great nation was based

  strains of music from somewhere above filled the
hall and the hundred jubilant voices of the children
joined in singing the solemn national anthem-
the song of the green wreath of love and toleration
which symbolized the union of cross and crescent
it was also a song of the equality of all those who
bear the human name of the universal birthright
and of the strength in a union which labors for the
universal good

  the afrikanders of the year  were more
men of deeds than words but at this moment when
the whole empire symbolized in its children of
many races was giving voice to the song of the
fatherland their hearts beat fast and high there
was a touch of solemn emotion about the scene

  the song ceased the music died out the children
disappeared as quietly as they had entered and
now the voice of the president rang through the
hall

  ladies and gentlemen senators councillors
and members of the parliament of the united
states of africa i welcome you to our cooperative
labors may the benediction of all good spirits be
with us

  this was the formula used at every opening of
the parliament the audience which had remained
standing during the song and the benediction took
seats and once more the voice of the president was
heard the old gentleman did not speak very
loudly and it would have been difficult to hear him
in the remote corners had not a well-arranged sys-
tem of loud-speakers transmitted his words even
to the last seats even in the most distant cities of
the continent the presidents address was being
heard carried across mountain plain and river by
the marvellous radio of the year 

  ladies and gentlemen senators councillors
and members of parliament the government of
this country has felt the necessity of summoning
you here to inform you of and obtain your opinion
on the situation of northern europe and to take
whatever relief measures are needed measures
to prevent a like calamity to our own country must
be considered as well as future developments

  you all know that our troubles have a single
center-the cosmic dust-cloud into which our globe
is plunging and wffich has produced climatic
changes altering and in cases making difficult the
existence of life throughout vast areas of our earth
international negotiations have led to the accept-
ance of an agreement through which every country
in a favorable climatic situation will undertake the
relief of those areas nearest it menaced by the ice

  the negotiations with his excellency the presi-
dent of the united states of europe have been
completed high commissioner ismail chak who
has returned from his inspection tour in the north
had the honor of being invited to rome and has
brought with him the necessary data for such re-
lief work as will be needed during his extensive
tour of inspection he had a personal opportunity to
the cosmic cloud	

form an impression of the exceedingly sad condi-
tions prevalent in northern europe his reports
have been supplemented by the technical observa-
tions of our government geologist mr vander-
strassen

  briefly the task before us is as follows ship-
ments of enough food to supply eighteen million
europeans must be forwarded regularly for a per-
iod which cannot at present be estimated another
twenty million europeans who have been deprived
of their homes will have to be cared for in our
country they will thus be placed in a position to
earn their own livings however we must find
homes food and employment for them at least for
the time being and this will necessitate a consider-
able amount of care expense and work for the gov-
ernment and its various ministries

  it is our duty as enlightened men and inhabi-
tants of a great continent which was rescued from
its long sleep by the efforts of europeans to do
everything we can to help our brethren in need
we will execute this duty with unselfish eagerness
but we must not close our eyes to the fact that
certain dangers lie in incorporating millions of
men and women into our community as guests
our laws and institutions depart widely from the
european standard

  another great problem lies before us at the
present time we are able to undertake these high
duties by means of economies in our government
the better utilization of our farm areas and the
further extension of our cattle-raising industry

  but we do not know how long this condition
will endure according to the estimates of our
scientists the glacial period is to last another two
thousand years and its effects will increase rather
than diminish

  even at the present moment traces of cold are
manifesting themselves in the more elevated sec-
tions of our country what will happen when our
crops also decrease and want arises in our country
no man can say there will come a time when we
are no longer able to help ourselves not to speak
of our foreign guests i do not wish to paint a dis-
couraging picture or to paralyze your energies by
giving up hope but it might well come to pass that
a forced migration from the north and south to-
ward the equator will set in such an event must
lead to terrible struggles made cruel by hunger
and more terrible than those of which the history
of past millennia tells us

chapter ix

a stirring debate

a feeling of emotion was visible in the aud-
ience it was not customary to interrupt the
address of the chief executive by interjections or
questions but the general stir gave evidence of
the impression his words had made

  i perceive that you realize the gravity of the
problems before us we must give our utmost
labors to prevent the coming misfortune so that
our descendants will be unable to accuse us of any
sins of omission if there are means of escaping
our fate none have as yet been discovered but
to stimulate all minds to stir all forces to action

the government of the united states of africa has
posted an award of one billion francs for the dis-
covery of a means for overcoming the effects of the
glacial period which -shall be approved as prac-
ticable by the scientific committee

  this country this continent which was once
called the dark continent will use its every effort
for the salvation of humanity perhaps it will be
the land to lead mankind to a more glorious fut-
ure

  the aged president stepped back from the trib-
une and sat down in the bronze throne on the dais
a roar of applause arose echoed from the marble
walls and the prisms of the skylight and finally
died away

  a moment later a light-signal above the presi-
dents seat lit up indicating that a radio-message
had arrived for immediate attention an expectant
silence fell upon the audience

  the chairman gave a signal to the unseen speak-
er to go ahead and a loud voice rang through the
auditorium

  his excellency the president of the united
states of europe wishes to address his greetings
to the congress

  we are ready to hear his excellency

  every word though it came from far-away
rome was clearly audible

  at this significant moment when his excell-
ency the president of africa the senators coun-
cillors and members of parliament of this power-
ful state are assembled to confer on the relief meas-
ures for our nation and its people it is my desire
to extend to the government the greetings of the
european federation of states and to thank you
for the helpful attitude with which you look upon
our difficulties may the work be as blessed as its
conception 

  the government and parliament thank your
excellency everything possible will be done to
help our brethren in the north of the globe

  the red signal was extinguished the food ad-
ministrator samuel machai a splendid man the
leader of the great jewish nation of palestine and
the pride of his countrymen and faith stroked his
long beard adjusted his spectacles on his promin-
ent nose and began to discuss the problem in all
its ramifications of feeding the multitude a con-
cealed apparatus projected figures curves and sta-
tistical charts onto a frosted glass screen on the
wall as he spoke all the questions discussed were
thus illustrated in a manner within the comprehen-
sion of the least intelligent it became apparent
that crop levels in south and north had not been
maintained but the yield from the equatorial zone
had gained this was followed by thorough re-
ports on the prospects of opening up new areas to
agricultural productivity and for improving the
methods of ranching samuel machai demanded
that the greater number of the expected immi-
grants be used in agricultural work in the general
interest

  he also emphasized the necessity of conducting
new experiments on the production of foods by
chemical means and suggested to the minister of
technology that all available forces be concentrated
on this task

  the minister of health pointed out that the
	wonder stories quarterly

adaptability of the europeans to the various clima-
tic conditions to be found in parte of africa must
be considered to avoid the outbreak of epidemics

  the ministers of finance and justice gave a
digest of the economic and legal measure necessary
to deal with the immigration problem

  high commissioner ismail chak offered a re-
port on his journey and showed motion pictures of
the ice-regions which were received with general
interest

  at this point mr albarnell the minister of
technology took the floor his speech was follow-
ed by the assemblage with considerable interest

  the scientific commission appointed by me has
enabled me to lay before you the following data
the cosmic cloud has so great an extent as to prom-
ise that its last limits will not pass the sun and
earth until two thousand years have gone by our
two leading experts dr rawlinson and dr ben-
haffa of the cairo observatory are however in dis-
agreement in their calculations by approximately
two hundred years but that is a technical question
which has little bearing on the problem itself at
all events the glacial period will last another two
millennia without doubt it will increase in sever-
ity since the earths temperature will continue to
decrease and will rise only when the sun-rays are
no longer hindered by the veil of dust

  both scientists mentioned are in agreement that
the cloud is of irregular density the solar radia-
tion will in short increase again while we are
passing through the thinner layers of the nebula
you already know that the last glacial period forty
thousand year ago ended and there is distinct
evidence of long-standing authenticity that during
that glacial period also warmer and colder phases
alternated the same is to be expected in our
case and holds for us some small consolation

icrp here is no means of withholding the ap-

  x proach of the ice-age or of eliminating it
due to the impossibility of altering the orbit of the
earth in space it is highly doubtful whether it
will be possible to counteract the effects of the
glaciation on the earth through any measures we
now know nevertheless it is our duty to give
every assistance in the development of all ideas on
the subject that offer any possibility of success
and for this reason that the enormous award of
one billion francs has been set aside the idea of
liberating the heat resources of the earths inter-
ior has been mooted this heat has already been
used for industrial purposes a commission of
geologists and technicians is now engaged in in-
vestigating this project which appears at first
sight of slight practicability

  the question of producing chemical foods has
already been mentioned experiments on a large
scale have been undertaken the artificial food-
stuffs invented by corella the south american
had to be prohibited again as they proved to cause
severe digestive disturbances after continued use
we can only hope that our own chemists will meet
with greater success they are doing their utmost

  mr albarnell left the tribune there was a no-
ticeable lack of enthusiasm with regard to his re-
port as was evidenced by an unmistakable mur-
muring and several interjections

  at this moment mme khadija effrem-latour
proceeded toward the tribune with that elegant en-
ergy characteristic of her she leafed through her
notes for a moment stroked a lock of almost bluish-
black hair out of her face and began to speak in
her clear melodious voice

  the senators and councillors of this country
have much to say with regard to the revelations
made by the government in particular we can see
no good resulting from an immigration of twenty
million europeans into this country many races
and many religions are living side by side here
peacefully under one flag and we can hardly say
of the inhabitants of the little continent to the
north that they are equally saturated with the con-
cept of universal equality narrowness has al-
ways been a peculiarity of the europeans and i
fear they will hardly throw off this characteristic
on coming to our shores

  at this moment the speaker was interrupted by
exclamations of approval from mr umararu and
mme birrha as well as other representatives from
the native states

  you see that i am far from being alone in this
skeptical attitude we expect the government to
guarantee that our guests will not be guilty of vio-
lating the limits of good taste

  furthermore the government fails to live up to
the maxim it teaches to the school-children
nothing should be done tomorrow that can be
done today the cosmic cloud has if i am not
mistaken been our unbidden companion for sev-
eral centuries already and the billion francs re-
ward could and should have been offered long
ago

  at these words sir archibald plug who had
been moving irritably in his seat could no longer
control himself like a watch-dog bristling at a
passing cat plug stirred in his seat as his peren-
nial opponent levelled her shafts at the govern-
ment

  archibald plug was one of the most curious
political figures of the country he did full jus-
tice to his name archibald plug consisted of two
spheres-a smaller one which was his head and a
larger from which certain unimportant extremi-
ties tried to give the impression of arms and legs
the totality of his structure reached no higher than
five feet in spite of sir archibalds efforts to create
an impression of height by a stiff and upright at-
titude

  he even made use of optical illusion knowing
that stripes make an object appear longer than it
really is the hon sir archibald was always to be
seen in a suit of vertical striping mme effrem-
latour had once stated to the huge amusement of
her auditors that sir archibalds globe consisted
of longitudes only though one ought to expect that
an old mariner would not forget the latitude-all
the more since in his case the width of the sphere
played a more important role than the length

  the round face of sir archibald was red like the
harvest moon and its top was ornamented with a
crop of white stubborn hair to this picture there
remains to be added a substantial well-reddened
nose evidence of his experience in the northern
sea where even in the year  hot toddy still
the cosmic cloud	

played an important part and a pair of eyes that
twinkled in perpetual amusement

  sir archibald plug was known as an expert in
all matters nautical for decades he had travelled
around the world as a captain on government ships
and in the employ of the great mercantile concerns
he had been sent to parliament by votes of the
mercantile and commercial interests when at the
age of fifty he swallowed the anchor for the last
time

  he was kind-hearted humorous and sensible
being what he was he always cherished a certain
animus against the sand-flies as he called them-
the inhabitants of the desert districts the arabs
tripolitans nilotes etc who in his opinion played
a more important role in the affairs of the country
than they were entitled to this was at the bot-
tom of his fiery but harmless debates with mme
effrem-latour as matters stood either would
have regretted losing the other from parliament

  as i said repeated mme effrem-latour the
government should have done something long be-
fore with this situation they knew about it it
has been in existence for centuries it is a little
late to save the world with its billion

at these words the white moustache of sir arch-
ibald bristled and the words tumbled from his

lips

  is the honorable member suggesting that we
could have escaped from this cloud before

  if we all took the point of view of sir archibald
it would not be necessary to discuss the prize since
if it is futile it is as much so today as it was a
hundred years ago

  no today we are further advanced in our
knowledge and technical attainments

  i fail to see in what manner

  nice of you to admit your lack of comprehen-
sion if there is any other question on which my
age can offer your youth advice i will be most
happy to do so

  which is one suspects the sole advantage you
have i believe wines and cheese also become more
valuable through storage

  no sooner had the burst of laughter filled the
hall than a range of green signals lit up in warn-
ing to the speakers to refrain from personalities

  thus was sir archibald cheated of the deadly
riposte he had on his lips the beautiful khadija
began again and at once caught the attention of
the officials as well as that of the senators and the
gallery

  the minister has stated that thus far no sug-
gestions of methods to cope with the ice-age have
offered promise is the honorable minister ignor-
ant of the fact that an eminent european scientist
a german by the name of johannes baumgart has
arrived in our country bringing with him a plan
for the solution of our problem and that he is
asking the support of the government

  the government knows nothing of this gentle-
man or his plans

  the government knows less than the news-
papers the latest edition of the african herald
carries all the details of the project dr rawlin-
son the director of our greatest state observatory
has already expressed his opinion on it in the same

journal a copy of which i will be glad to let the
government have on the payment of ten centimes
mme effrem-latour extended the paper toward
the ministerial table with a mocking smile the
gentlemen there were somewhat perplexed minis-
ter albarnell showing particular embarrassment
the hall boomed with whispered conversation

  this desert-cat said sir archibald plug to his
neighboring colleague an old dutchman has dug
up another good bone devil of a woman

  the minister rose

  since mme effrem-latour has obtained special
information with which we have not yet been ac-
quainted i should like to ask her to lay it before
the meeting it is rather singular that the eminent
scientist approached the newspapers instead of the
government

  i will be glad to comply with your wish and tell
you of the plans of the german scientist he is
of the opinion that on all habitable globes life has
taken the same general course and will continue to
follow a regular pattern even on the moon he
thinks humans lived in earlier ages they became
extinct by reason of the falling temperature there
in combination with other difficulties at all events
they were forced to face the problem of cold for
many thousands of years and had undoubtedly dis-
covered means of dealing with it

  now if we could only get to the moon we could
find traces of these measures very important in-
formation which would have a profound influence
on our future ought to be available from these ex-
tinct lunarites he proposes to make the journey
in a space ship not unlike our rocket-cars and for
this reason he is asking for government support
a bold conception to say the least i leave it to
our technical men to decide whether it is practical
the hall was in a turmoil a vast hum of con-
versation rose opinions ideas and even jokes ming-
led together the ministers conferred and minis-
ter albarnell gesticulated rapidly toward someone
whose attention he seemed to have difficulty in at-
tracting

  meanwhile sir archibald plug had taken up the
cudgels again and quite independently of the rest
were carrying on their debate

  madam this is a most chimerical idea if it
were not printed in the african herald i should
imagine that some arabian story-teller had whis-
pered it to you in that land of the fata morgana
which you represent

  it is not unusual sir for people who are behind
the time to consider everything new impossible
when columbus put out into unknown seas it was
freely predicted that he would fall off the edge of
the earth you may remember when the first
railroads were constructed even quite learned men
declared that the passengers would be suffocated by
the speed at which they travelled and today
steam railroads have been abandoned because they
are too slow

  and when the first airplanes were invented the
inventors were told they were daring the immut-
able edicts of god and that man could never fly
since the lord had refused him wings we have
been flying for more than a thousand years sir and
somewhat faster than most of the creatures to
whom god granted wings i stand here now to

predict the time will come when people will laugh
at your opinion that we cannot leave the earth
just as we now laugh at the false prophets of ear-
lier days

  nobody could live for a second on the moon-
even supposing he has arrived

  a means will be found

  not a sign of human activity is to be seen on
the moon

  that is i submit a matter for expert decision
and i say in the light of all modem scientific
knowledge that the moon is a wandering corpse
where there is nothing to be found

  i submit that the honorable gentleman has not
been there and knows nothing about it he must
not imagine that because he is the proprietor of a
moon of his own that he is qualified to speak on all
planetary bodies

  this shaft at the bald head of sir archibald
again brought forth a burst of hilarity

  it is a demonstrated fact madam that the
length of the hair is in inverse proportion to the
amount of brains beneath it may i now add that
a journey to the moon would be the means of sacri-
ficing a number of valuable lives without the least
result

  and why should we not stake our last resource
in our predicament have we not a half-dozen
brave men in africa millions of men fell in
bloody battles for far less worthy causes in the
dark ages often merely to further the plans of
egotistical potentates or pugnacious statesmen i
cannot believe that our country is unable to find
men to volunteer even with the slightest chance of
bringing about the end of this calamity even i
a poor woman would be glad to offer my help for
what it is worth

  permit me to offer to go in your place madam
old man plug is not the man to stand back even in
a hopeless cause moreover it would be a posi-
tive delight to make the trip if the honorable mem-
ber did not accompany the party

  my compliments sir archibald i promise to
offer you my hand in marriage on your safe re-
turn

  the moon-faced little man laughed through his
white moustache and made a biting remark which
was lost amid the general hilarity which had taken
possession of the meeting and which not even the
honorable president refused to join but now the
green signals demanding silence were alight once
more

  samuel machai the nestor of the ministry rose
to speak for the ministry and councillors

  the communication from the senator have been
heard with interest by the government at first
sight the proposal appears somewhat fantastic but
it has always been africas ambition to be a step
in advance and to push great ideas to fruition be-
fore the majority of the worlds people consider
them practicable in short the government will
hear the suggestions of the foreign scientist with
considerable interest and will appoint a special
scientific commission to investigate his claims
should there be any prospect no matter how slight
that the plans admit of realization and that they
offer any prospect of furnishing the key to our

problem this government will not hesitate to grant
its support

  an approving murmur ran through the gigantic
auditorium khadija effrem-latour took up her
notes and left the tribune

  half an hour later the senators and councillors
streamed from the pleasing coolness of the build-
ing into the glowing heat that waved through the
streets like the halo above a stove the white
marble steps were covered with the dark spots that
marked dissolving groups of people the thin veil
of the fountain descended unbroken above shone
the golden dome like a yellow sun

the first warning

ut f you like we can stroll over there to that
x little grove there in the distance by the
eucalyptus grove is greenpoint you can see the
top of the lighthouse behind that little hill we
can get a gorgeous view there-far out over the
sea

  yes lets walk over there miss hawthorn i
dont know of anything i would rather do on this
bright morning with its marvellous air that is
aside from the enjoyment i get from talking to
you in my mother-tongue it makes me feel really
quite at home

  i have never been away from home much and
can hardly imagine the feelings of a person who is
aware that continents and wide oceans lie between
him and his home

  do you know that there is not the least bit of
afrikander about you you must have inherited
all your mothers german nature a certain con-
tentment in a world created about ones self if you
knbw what i mean an inclination for meditating
philosophizing and romance all that is not at all
characteristic of the nation of which you are a
citizen their chief characteristics seem to be a
sharp and rapid comprehension of the practical
facts of life technical industrial and commercial
initiative without much sentiment behind it just
what you frequently find among migrated peoples
who have had to fight for hundreds of years for
their place in the sun either against savages or
with axe and spade against the wilderness

  i have been conscious of this for some time my-
self it is your way of looking at things from a
kind of distant perspective that makes me really
see them clearly an understanding of myself has
been granted to me over night so to speak

  i hope the consciousness of the contrast has not
made you unhappy your wonderful father and
your home are a world in themselves and between
them manage to keep you out of the world
father is the best man in the world but the
business takes up all his time and most of his en-
ergy i sometimes feel lonesome i have nobody
who really enters into my interests everybody
in this country talks about commercial enterprises
stock transactions new industrial plants new ma-
chines for using wave-energy and big shafts being
driven to the magma-filled depths in the cape coun-
try to get at the internal heat they speak of ma-
chines of things that are steel and stone but never

of the abstract which exists only in thoughts and
which may be embodied in a poem a rustling in
the trees or a bird singing his evening song

  it is the tragedy of our time and you have not
yet fully comprehended its significance even
though you suffer through it you see human
culture occurs in cycles up and down up and
down in mighty waves like those of the oceans
crest and base it goes on and the highest wave
must at last ebb away into a calm a whole series
of such waves of culture have swept the earth

  many thousands of years ago china reached
its apogee then mighty india later egypt then
greece and finally western europe-and all these
cultures defended their proud positions for eight
hundred or even a thousand years grew like trees
and like rotted stumps died out the youth of a
culture is always an effort toward an exalted ideal
-the glorious pursuit of a vision accompanied by
a holy fire of inspiration and from the fire are
lighted the arts songs and sagas come works of
great masters poems in stone rise-high cathe-
dral that embody the ideas of the true the just and

the beautiful such a time is always the great the
golden age the climax of the culture

the white towering castles of ice were floating
nearer slowly said the german the cold is
approaching these shores also

  then a different spirit slowly sets in a lust
for power leads to martial invasion of neighboring
lands to the founding of great empires on a pile
of bones a craving for fame riches and abund-
ance luxuries rots the national spirit arts re-
ligions and philosophies come to be little valued and
materialistic ambitions replace them commerce
reaches its highest point there is an age of inven-
tion and great industries come into being the
social problem splits every nation into a series of
discrete fragments a small minority of merchant-
princes dominate the army of the proletariat and
nations and societies dissolve in furious combat

  culture reaches its nadir and dies out while
somewhere else a new branch begins to bear a new
	wonder stories quarterly

fruit of culture the whole game begins once more
as the biologist can bring the microscopic to great-
er animation through higher temperatures or can
bring it to flowering or death by means of its
food so are we inhabitants of a little star so are
we the toys of an incomprehensible who makes us
dance marionette-like at his pleasure

  johannes baumgart stroked the lock out of his
eyes staring before him as though he had forgot-
ten that a girl was walking by his side whom he
might confuse by his flood of singular images

  elizabeth hawthorn glanced slantwise at the
intellectual features of her companion what man
had ever spoken to her before about the problems
of the infinite how deep his knowledge ran and
how vast a view had one through his eyes she
felt as though she had known him for as many
months as she had really known him days how
much she had learned merely from hearing him talk
the day before the great atlas by means of which
they had intended travelling through germany
had scarcely been opened the hours had passed
like minutes and her father had smilingly remarked
that she would become the most learned of female
senators if their guest continued his historical lec-
tures for a few more weeks and how thoroughly
this man seemed to know the master-mind goethe
how he brought hidden treasures from his works

she could have talked to and wandered with him
for days could have listened to him forever
without weariness while he discoursed on human-
ity and the mystery of life and on the rise and
fall of peoples and universes

  and miss hawthorn in this waxing and wan-
ing of a culture in this change through which the
human mind must go during such a period lies the
secret of that feeling of loneliness of complete for-
sakenness which you and many another exper-
ience here and there people in whom the old
ideal of culture has been retained through some
freak of inheritance are still living to them a
poem a sunset a bird who sings his even-song in
the silent forest or the solemnity which dwells in
old cathedrals mean more than all the technical
wonder-works and luxuries of a refined age

  but the people around you have long since taken
the strings from the lyre and so your heart-strings
find no answer only a kind of astonishment that
this should be so remains with you the dreamer
always feels cold and strange in such a world it
is this feeling that oppresses you

  you cant imagine how much your words im-
press me you seem to hold the true clue to the
world of my sentiments it is through you that i
have learned to see myself-strange that the man
who was to solve in a few hours all the mysteries
that have burdened me for years should come from
far away across mountain and deserts

  well it is not really so astonishing as all that
said baumgart with his melodious laugh i can
put myself into your place all the more easily since
i am a similarly unmodern being-a dreamer rke
yourself goethe whom you so much admire says
thou art like unto the spirit which thou compre-
hendest i reverse the quotation and say ttiou
understandoth the spirit unto which thou art like
the difference between us is that i have thought

out all these things and searched for their causes
while you have borne them with resignation in the
seclusion of your home there are between your
world of thought and your cold environment un-
bridgeable gulfs

  elizabeth did not answer her clear eyes looked
into the distance and her heart was full and within
herself her being cried out to the man by her side
in a hundred ways yes indeed we are of the
same spirit we have always been friends and only
the strange dualism of life has separated us by so
long and so far you are a meteor curving bril-
liantly across my sky illuminating what has always
been dark within me and will presently disappear
into far-away space for long i shall continue to
feel the reflection of your light within me-perhaps
for my whole life

  the two travellers had reached the rounded hills
which fell away to the ocean from the lions shoul-
ders they were standing in a group of tall trees
looking out on the bright surface of the sea there
was scarcely a wave to disturb the mirror-like sur-
face of the atlantic a sleeping giant there he lay
in the soft light of dawn to the right stood the
stone column of the old lighthouse and out near
greenpoint the white sail of a fishing boat was vis-
ible proceeding toward three anchor bay while
behind them the dark mass of the mountain heaved
its black shape against the morning sky

  the dew still glittered on grass and bush sea-
birds stalked along the shore and now and then
came some sound that showed the town was waking
to the concerns of daily life like the whistle of a
factory or the hum of an electric railroad

  for a long time the two stood looking into the
young day across the vast ocean which far beyond
the field of their vision was breaking on the shores
of south america

  you know it gives one a strange feeling to stand
here on the last rim of a great continent and to
know that all round us a measureless waste of
water extends separating us from distant contin-
ents that bear other peoples and other cultures
miss hawthorn wouldnt you like to go-way out
there to unknown south america or toward the
antarctic ice which gleams under this same sun
somewhere in the south

  ah yes sometimes i wish i could go far away
but it is more a desire to escape this noisy unrest-
ful and somewhat unnatural world and to reach
some peaceful shore-oh some little island with
lonely forests and hidden springs where people are
still original but is there tell me any such thing
left on our planet

  here and there perhaps but very little remains
of the islands of the blessed with their happy peo-
ples the age of the early explorers and circum-
navigators must have been glorious to go out in-
to the unknown toward lands far in the distance
only vaguely outlined to find undreamed-of trea-
sures and bold adventures-ah that was the age
when the world-maps showed only europe part of
asia and northern africa and those in crude out-
line and when every distant country seemed to be
inhabited by dreadful giants strange dwarfs and
misshapen fabulous beings we can hardly under-
stand nowadays how much courage our ancestors
the cosmic cloud	

needed to venture out into this unknown world in
their diminutive vessels

  and how fast everything has changed a
millennium and a half has gone by and now the
world is explored to its last corner and covered by
the web of civilization distance has been abol-
ished we cross the ocean in a few days by means
of electric ships race from land to land through the
air on the wings of the wind speak from our own
homes with people in india and america and
through the televisor see things that are happen-
ing thousands of miles away

  but all this is no longer startling since we have
learned to see the earth which once upon a time
was so vast to us in its real smallness it is only a
grain of sand in the universe indeed an apple in-
habited by bacteria the sun is a million and a
quarter times larger than this little planet and yet
the sun itself is hundreds of times smaller than
other stars far away in space and our telescopes
show us more than two hundred million suns and
solar systems with planets like our earth up there
in the night sky

  i can hardly think of it without confusion it
gives me the sensation of being smaller than a pro-
tozoan in some puddle it is the stunning of the
senses face to face with the infinite do you know
the wonderful painting by the indian painter raw-
atami called the mantle of god in this pic-
ture the lord of being is floating in the universe
a wide luminous mantle envelops him in gorgeous
folds its train losing itself into the infinite the
mantle is woven of millions of stars millions of in-
habited worlds

johannes baumgart nodded pensively he
glanced out over the ocean a point of light
visible far in the south had attracted his attention
it was neither a motor-ship nor a sail slowly
very gently the shimmering object drifted nearer
driven by the caprice of wind and wave a sudden
shaft of light set it glittering like a star

  look it is an iceberg coming here from the
antarctic and there at the right is another one-
and more-far behind a chain of them glittering in
the sun they are the messengers of the ice-age
in former times they never got so far north as
these latitudes

  elizabeth shaded her eyes and looked out over
the ocean

  you arent looking in the right direction more
over that way-no there baumgart came very
close to her touching her shoulder lightly his
face approached hers his arm pointing out over the
ocean to direct her eyes toward the far-glittering
sails of the ice

  she felt the soft pressure of his hand a lock of
his dark hair touched her temple and she gave a
little involuntary tremor

chapter xi

a fantastic plan

with a jerk she brought her attention back
from the strange dreamy feeling that gripped
her yes she saw the icy wonders shining like
mirrors baumgart handed her his glass the

white towering castles of ice set with blue shad-
ows were floating nearer strange festoons of
huge icicles hanging balconies jagged pillars and
lofty portals were visible sea birds fluttered about
the cornices of the floating mountains of ice af-
fording a basis for realizing the gigantic size of
these icy children of the frost drifting up from the
pole the waves broke slowly around their feet
now and then some long swell sent them swaying
and a dazzling set of sunbeams was reflected back
from their mirrored surfaces

  further south the ocean is filled with these cold
beautiful castles said the german and slowly
the cold is approaching these shores also who
knows what the cape country will be like in two
or three centuries

  which shows how untrue the old saying is that
man has become the master of nature the apple
with the bacteria has been placed in an ice-chamber
by an invisible all-powerful hand and the tiny meg-
alomaniacs must realize that all their ability cannot
get them out of it tomorrow the great session of
the senate will be held at zanzibar i am anxious
to know what they will do about it

  i am as much interested as you all my future
plans depend upon it

  does the problem of the ice-age play a role in
your affairs as well 

  it has occupied all my time for decades thats
the reason im in this country

  my father suggested to me that you had some-
thing astonishing up your sleeve he said that the
whole world would be talking about your plans but
did not go into any details he said you had asked
him to be discreet for the time being

  that is right i believe i have found a way to
obtain help for the troubles of the world in a
few days i will be able to say more about it parti-
cularly to the government of this country whose
support i am counting on but the outcome de-
pends a good deal on technical matters and that is
the reason i came to see your father the splendid
flights of the usambaranite rockets make me confi-
dent about the practicability of my idea

  you want to penetrate the ice region

  the german smiled about his lips played an
expression of mingled amusement and irony he
looked into the attentive face of his young compan-
ion and with an air of comical secretiveness said
you would never guess

  do you want to descend into the middle of the
earth and reach the hearth of the eternal fires i
have read about such plans in the papers

  no no you cant guess it

  or is it to go down into the depths of the ocean
and deflect the gulf stream so that its warm waters
will provide the shores of freezing europe with
more heat

  how clever you are no it isnt that either
you are guessing in vain

  elizabeth hawthorn laughed you are a bad
man i think curiosity is the curse of our sex
im at the end of my guesses and quite at your
mercy

  you spoke a while back of landing on far-away
shore where tranquility reigns and all the noise
of our civilization is non-existent it is to such an
	wonder stories quarterly

island of the blessed that the usambaranite rocket
will take me

  and where is this island

  very far-and yet you can see it distinctly with
your own eyes

  mr baumgart you have the faculty of present-
ing a thing in such a mysterious manner as to make
one despair of ever penetrating its secret

  why dont you look at the island high up
there it is shimmering in the sunlight

  he pointed with his hand up into the deep blue
of the sky where the waning moon was hanging a
feeble yellowish crescent

  elizabeth hawthorn followed the pointed finger
and saw the round old companion of the earth pal-
ing in the gaining day she laughed

  yes if one could get up there but i answer
with the words of our mutual friend goethe ah
to the wings of the spirit the wings of the body
never can be wedded well i will come with you
to the island of the moon

  you had better not for the first time at least
because the journey is still as dangerous as that
the first circumnavigators took to reach this cape
or the shores of america far in the west but
perhaps in a hundred years from now rackamers

	co will arrange such pleasure trips for every-
body as they now run them to the south pole in
the icy deserts of which daring explorers perished
centuries ago

  but now you must really tell me about the pur-
pose of your journey

  you already know it

  you are a stubborn joker-on purpose i think
is this your way of thanking me for bringing you
out to greenpoint on this beautiful morning or
do you want me too to remain in the dark about
your plans

baumgart paused his face took on an ex-
pression of seriousness and she felt that he
was speaking in deadly earnest when he said

  i am not making it a secret for you it is ac-
tually my intention to reach this neighboring world
and you will find out all the details during the com-
ing days what seems to you and probably to
most people so fantastic today like everything that
is a first step into a closed land will later on when
once the start has been made and the ban has been
lifted be as much a matter of course as a journey
to australia a flight in an airplane or a wireless
telegram from a distance

  elizabeth did not answer slowly they proceed-
ed toward the point where they could take the
electric railroad to the city a thousand strange
feelings and ideas made her head whirl no doubt
this man at her side was speaking of this journey
to a land of improbability in sober earnest if any-
body else had suggested such a thing she would
have smiled and eight days ago she would not have
wasted a second in considering a project so fan-
tastic

  but she could see that this was no fantastic
dreamer anxious to startle the public by this biz-
arre scheme of his make the newspapers write
about him for a while and blow splendid bubbles
which would sink in an ocean of ironical laughter
after a brief career here was the complete man

who in spite of the profundity of his emotional life
avoided the will o the wisps and dream-wanderings
of so many others the thoughts he was revolving
in his brain must therefore lie within the realm of
practicability

  but then he was a man who wanted to venture
for the first time into the unknown shoreless sea of
space a columbus of the stellar world

  the thought excited her the blood was hurry-
ing through her veins and she could hardly under-
stand how this man was able to walk so calmly at
her side to speak so gently and brilliantly about
goethe the tranquil beauty of german landscapes
or of other everyday things strange pictures ran
through her brain in hurried procession she saw
this man mount one of those rocket ships penetrate
the ether to the applause of uncountable millions
disappear into the universe as a point of light she
saw herself in the midst of the bystanders saw him
bid her goodbye with a last squeeze of her hand
and saw for a long time his serious eyes follow hers
among all the million eyes around her like a
buzzing fly the bright point disappeared into the
blue of the heavens the moon looked down with
serious impassive face the masses dispersed in all
directions amid a whirl of conversation and she
stood alone in the depressing aloneness of the vast
plain staring straight up then the skies grew
dark the moon became a glowing red its kind old
face took on a menacing grimace a point of light
became visible amid the immensity of starry space
grew into a flaming torch burst at an inconceivable
height and the burning fragments fell to earth a
voice called her name with the agony of death in its
accents and a scorched body crashed down beside
her 

  she swayed and groaned aloud-
  what is it miss hawthorn

  johannes baumgart anxiously took her hands
she woke as though from a dream and lowered her
head in confusion her foot traced a pattern in the
loose sand and a blush covered her face as she
whispered hesitantly and almost inaudibly

  must it be must you of all people undertake
this journey into that unexplored land of the-in-
conceivable

  baumgart understood what was going on in his
companions mind he squeezed the little hand
caressingly and said simply yes it must be

  is there nobody back home who needs you
whom you love who has a claim on you or has the
right to keep you from such a venture

  no one nobody at all i am all alone but
even if there were people who had such a claim it
would have to make room for the greater one which
humanity has on me think of the millions of war-
riors who in former times fared forth to battle
they too sacrificed themselves for the general good
sacrificed for an idea only a few of them were
individuals of education or intelligence yet they did
what they thought their duty i would not be what
i am if i did not do what i must what the law of
my own personality dictates to me

and there is no one who can hold you back
no one nothing but the mere technical im-
possibility of my plans which would then be left
for a later more advanced age to execute but i
do believe that it can be done with the ways and
the cosmic cloud	

means known to us and everything has been work-
ed out with the expenditure of lengthy and pain-
staking labor the technical side has been most
carefully investigated and here and there improved
and now it will be investigated once more your
own father and one of the most experienced engin-
eers of this country will do their share to make the
flight into the unknown possible the unknown is
better known that you imagine however dont let
my plans frighten you and dont burden your heart
with the thought of imaginary dangers

  yet you may say i have a small mind  for
i wish there were someone in this world who could
persuade you not to go

  there is none and there could be none they
would have to yield to higher laws and the higher
love-that of humanity as a whole if they did not
understand that it would personify egotism rather
than love or friendship think of goethes words
with the gods no one man should measure himself
should he lift himself upward nowhere will his
feet touch firm ground and he will become the sport
of cloud and wind 

  believe me i realize the warning set forth in
these words but here it is not to war against the
gods that i strive but to attempt a deed for the
good of mankind basing it on thorough research
let me parry your quotation with another from
goethe a god has designed a way for each to
travel down which the fortunate run with speed
to the goal but he whose heart is choked by mis-
fortune struggles in vain against the barriers wov-
en of steely threads through which the bitter shears
can cut but once

  and now give me your dear hand i thank you
for your kind interest in my fate and know how to
appreciate it perhaps the day will come   
johannes baumgart made an awkward move-
ment he was still holding the hand of his com-
panion looking pensively into the distance then
wakening he stroked the lock of hair back from his
forehead squeezed once more the small graceful
hand and said

  lets say no more about it what will be will
be for eternal iron laws compel us all to complete
the cycle of our existence	

  the sun stood almost at his zenith a ruddy veil
of dust hung round it strange purple clouds were
rising in the south and a storm seemed imminent

  the two wanderers proceeded hastily and silently
toward the nearby city

chapter xii

a flight to the south

the sun was already high in the heavens when
standerton-quil awoke he btretched his mus-
cular limbs yawned long and comfortably and
slowly raised himself in bed he had not slept so
well for weeks ill recommend these rocket trips
as a cure for insomnia he remarked good-humor-
edly at the present its still somewhat expen-
sive but in another quarter-century people will
have their rockets in the garage just like an air-
plane or electric car today

  undoubtedly this new journey carrying high
government officials to the north would contribute

considerably to the popularization of the new means
of traffic and hawthorns factory would after all
the lengthy experiments and model-building see
the fruit of its labors ripening

  he turned toward the clock his glance fell up-
on the telephone the green signal was alight
had been for hours perhaps someone had called
by jove it was almost noon

  with one leap he was out of bed he stepped
to the receiver and pushed the button of the tele-
phonograph which had taken the message for him
themechanism snorted and in a hoarse voice re-
produced the words engraved on its waxen heart
usambaranite works cape town called june
 nine a m return call requested at earliest
convenience

  now look what i missed wonder what old
man hawthorn wants well lets see

  without wasting time on his toilet standerton-
quil set about obtaining a connection with cape
town then leaped into the bathroom disappeared
under the shower blew like a walrus rubbed his
strong limbs till he looked like a redskin ran the
comb through his bristles and hopped into his
clothes ujam his adroit little valet arrived with
the tiny breakfast to which he limited himself as
the engineer was swallowing the first gulp of tea
the green signal came on again

  hello

  is this you standerton

  in person hawthorn

  but i have been on your trail for twelve hours
man where have you been hiding yourself

  the engineer gave vent to a rumbling laugh
you know i went north in the rocket taking
high commissioner ismail chak i was dead-tired
just got home when a trip to rome was necessary
i got home late last night slept like a corpse and
woke up ten minutes ago

  everything go all right on the long trip north
no failures in the steering gear or anything
everything smooth as silk the shocks are a
little bit heavy yet i should think the charges
could be made still smaller and the number of
explosions per second increased would increase
smoothness and diminish shock

  well talk about that later now listen stan-
derton something big has come up a really im-
portant plan i cant give you the details now
the practicability of the idea depends essentially
on your cooperation you had better come down
here and look over the plans give us your judgment
on them and help us out if you think we can do it
then well get in touch with the government peo-
ple can you come the sooner the better
you make me curious you must have some-
thing quite exciting on

  it will surprise even you how soon can you
come

  i intended to go to the extraordinary session
day after tomorrow but if it is so important   
i always like a technical problem infinitely better
than the most beautiful parliamentary speeches
i cant get away from here before evening though
a lot of work piled in on me the last few days pll
get that out take a wink of sleep and start about
midnight pll take one of the small rockets and
arrive by tomorrow noon there will be moonlight
	wonder stories quarterly

and i can make top speed all the way i have no
doubt that old kowenkott who is the best mechanic
in africa will be tickled to drag the iron horse out
of its barn the more adventurous the better is
his motto hes mad at me now because i didnt
take him along on the northern trip

  excellent so ill have you with me for dinner
tomorrow but be prepared to stay a few days
standerton we have a lot to talk over and now
i wont hold you up any longer so long

  good bye

  the green signal went out

  standerton-quil never did spend much time over
his breakfast but this time he broke it off even
after the first cup of tea and stormed past the start-
led ujam who had appeared with hat and cane
in passing he dashed his fingers through the care-
ful coiffure of the black boy threw him a pack of
cigarettes and leaped into the descending elevator
new engineering plans he lived for them and
this time it must be something great for hawthorn
did not become excited and would not make anyone
undertake a nocturnal journey of two and a half
thousand miles without something worthwhile at
the end of it

  the day passed more rapidly than standerton
would have liked kowenkott whom he had notified
as he left was cleaning the great projectile at the
airport with loving care preparatory to its blazing
departure through the moonlight he gave all the
mechanical parts a careful inspection put the long
barrels with the tiny explosion-charges into the
automatic feeder and cleaned the exhaust then
he rolled the craft back into its hangar closed the
gates and lay down on a mattress beside his be-
loved rocket to get a little sleep sharply at twelve
standerton knocked at the gate he wound the
map with the direction index tested the compass
saw to the batteries for illumination and with the
assistance of kowenkott rolled the vehicle up the
starting-ramp into the open ten minutes later
they were rattling into the air like a minor thunder-
storm sending the catapult back into the hangar
with a crash

shaking his head the old watchman looked
after the rapidly disappearing vehicle the
world was growing crazier every day he would
not have entered that new machine to save his neck
for him the comfortable old airplanes were good
enough but of course the world was progressing
and things had to change now and then like a
tiny shooting star the rocket vanished from the
old mans field of vision he closed the gate of the
hangar grumblingly at a great height the strange
bird flew along dragging behind it a dim white
trail of smoke-puffs

  standerton-quil stood motionless on his naviga-
ting bridge looking out into the darkness the
lights were turned down and the stars gave him all
the direction signals he needed far below lay the
land invisible in the darkness with great cities in-
dicated here and there by little patches of light
off to the east a dim gleam betrayed the presence
of the immense surface of the indian ocean
straight ahead in a chain of mountains the long
thin shape of lake nyassa was visible

  a dim glow hung in the heights across which

drifted thin violet veils they were dust-masses
even now touched by the rays of the sun refracted
around the edges of the globe the stars had ac-
quired a deep green hue they looked like emer-
alds at unattainable distances in the east bright-
ening the horizon the waning moon ascended like
a luminous gondola from the fog of the plain which
waved to and fro in a ghost-dance of its own here
and there lay the mirror-like surface of a lake or
river the mountain-chains cast long shadows
and vast forests stood strangely in the misty night
about four oclock in the morning the wide silver
ribbon of the great zambesi became visible below
and the rocket-car rattled past the foaming masses
of victoria falls

  when the rocket glided over the lonely kalahari
the first rays of the sun were blinking through the
window of the control chamber soon thereafter
they looked down on the tom ground of kimberly
where long shadows played among the workings of
the diamond mines in the distance rose the moun-
tain-mass which like a huge wall defended the
flanks of the continent against the assaults of the
sea

  standerton-quil had directed his vehicle almost
in a straight line only the fewest of steering ex-
plosions had to be applied by kowenkott the edi-
tors of the african herald enjoying their lunch-
time siesta on the roof of their tall building about
noon were awakened by the drone of the explosions
and their blinking eyes saw the gleaming rocket
car approaching a few minutes later stander-
tons ship descended at the east of the city beyond
the railroad line where the great airport of the
world-famous factory offered every facility for
landing

  hawthorn was sitting at his desk crowded with
papers of every description when he heard the rat-
tle of the usambaranite rocket doubtless it was
standerton-quil that gentleman arrived with a
punctuality of a personified machine hawthorn
stepped out on the balcony around which rustled
the treetops sure enough there was one of the
glittering speedy machines he recognized it from
its outline as one of the mark ii smaller type cars

  a satisfied smile brightened his features the
painstaking year-long experiments and the im-
mense expenditures had at last borne their fruit
it was his factory that had created the ultimate
means of traffic for the year  a method of
transportation to which the future must pay tri-
bute and of which the whole world was talking
and if the plans of this strange german should be
brought to realization if from this spot a man
should venture out into starry space for the first
time-a new era in the history of mankind would
be begun an era rendered possible through the
usambaranite rocket with which the name haw-
thorn would be associated until the end of time

  at this moment his daughter was walking down
tree-lined lane with her interesting guest haw-
thorn waved to them seeing the two side by side
deep in each others discourse he thought how well
they were suited to each other well   one
could but see both seemed interested and whom
god hath joined let no man put asunder

  elizabeth waved back with a newspaper she held
when within hearing distance she shouted fath-
the cosmic cloud	s

er heres something terrible mr baumgart wants
to speak to you

  the latter hurried forward with a somewhat ill-
humored expression lifting his hat respectfully
enough but a certain air of distrust was apparent
in his manner

  hawthorn spoke

  whats so terrible my child

  an indiscretion father are you too busy to
listen to us now its really quite important
hawthorn looked his astonishment what in the
world could he wrong aloud he said why cer-
tainly i am at your and mr baumgarts disposal
this very moment wont you please come up

  an indiscretion what could it be certainly
nothing important about the factory but hadnt
elizabeth said that this mr baumgart- and
he did seem a trifle indignant could it be in con-
nection with the germans plan in any case his
own hands were quite clean as far as indiscretions
were concerned was any man alive able to re-
proach hawthorn with the slightest abuse of con-
fidence

a knock at the door

come in please

  good morning father

  good morning my child and good morning mr
baumgart i hope you enjoyed your walk but i
also notice that you are a trifle disturbed please
be seated and now what is it my child about the
indiscretion

  here father please read this

  hawthorn took the morning edition of the afri-
can herald from his daughters hands a staring
scarehead read as follows

sensational plan of a foreign scien-
tist to save humanity - journey
to the moon-help from the
lunarians-support of our
government requested-
scientist arrives in
cape town

  what is this

  hawthorn with a troubled look sank into his
chair

  please read this father mr baumgart says
that the entire confidential interview which he held
with you on the first day of his visit is quoted here
in a condensed form slightly distorted and with-
out technical knowledge but showing clearly that
the information must have come from this office
the manager of the usambaranite works read
hastily through the account the wrinkles in his
forehead deepened as he read but there was an ex-
pression of proud fearlessness on his face as he
stepped toward his guest

  mr baumgart we are face to face with a mys-
tery i trust that my word is sufficient assurance
that i have not the faintest idea how the plan you
confided to me got into this paper and it goes
without saying that i have discussed your ideas
with no one not even my own daughter even
when calling standerton-quil who incidentally
has just arrived on long distance i have avoided
the faintest suggestion this should be sufficient
the word of a gentleman is quite sufficient mr
hawthorn but you will understand that the mere

fact of the thing getting into print and even more
so the mysterious circumstances are particularly
embarrassing to me you and miss elizabeth are
the only persons on this continent who know any-
thing at all of my ideas and i am perfectly sure
of my two friends in germany the mystery is
therefore really very alarming and it must be so
for you also it means that your walls are no
longer sound-proof and you cannot be sure in the
future that some important trade-secret of your
plant will not be bruited about in the streets tomor-
row

  you are right it could only have been some
eavesdropper who caused the leak and i shall insti-
tute a strict investigation i regret most deeply
that such a misfortune befell you in my office and
i shall do all i can to remove the disagreeable con-
sequences first of all we must try to find out
whether our people here think your plan a good
one and then you must submit your suggestion to
the government without the slightest delay-if pos-
sible today

  baumgart rose and shook the old mans hand
i thank you from the bottom of my heart he
said the article itself has done the idea no real
damage but it must appear to your government as
very tactless to inform the newspapers before com-
ing to the people i am asking for support further-
more among the portion of the public capable of
forming a reasoned judgment this sensational and
superficial presentation will not induce confidence
in my idea

  quite so and there the danger lies we had to
suffer a similar setback before when the papers
brought out the first reports on our rocket-cars
well my word at least has some weight with the
government and i will arrange to have the matter
cleared up as quickly as possible moreover the
laws of our country which impose high penalties
on such damaging indiscretions are on your side
but we must not forget that the african herald is
a powerful force in itself and we must avoid mak-
ing an enemy of it

  a knock at the door was heard

  come in

  standerton-quils imposing figure appeared in
the doorway at the sight of elizabeth and the
stranger he bowed

  well met standerton here mr baumgart is
the man of whom i have already spoken a con-
siderable portion of the success of your idea de-
pends on him he is the co-deaigner of the rocket
flying ship and one of the most outstanding engin-
eers of the country at present engaged in the
utilization of subterranean heat in the service of
the government

  johannes baumgart looked into the cool ener-
getic face of the man who stood before him tall
and strong like an oak his clear penetrating eye
the steadfast resolute expression about his mouth
the deep vertical furrow of thought above his nose
his studied movements bespoke the man of action
he was evidently one who looked at life from a
realistic standpoint without allowing sentiment to
enter his calculations who carried out any plan
quietly and resolutely and who rejected all plans
calmly and decidedly when they appealed to him as
hopeless
	wonder stories quarterly

  baumgart felt him a man to be trusted such a
man would be just the character to furnish the
technical background for his plans a dreamer or
enthusiast would have been useless for the plan
itself was so fantastic that it demanded execution
of the most cool and matter-of-fact sort

  the two shook hands each of them sought to
solve the riddle of the others personality at a
glance

  in mr johannes baumgart who arrivedfrom
germany a few days ago you are meeting the man
whose ideas will keep us busy for several days and
perhaps for the rest of our lives let it be suffi-
cient for the time being that he is a famous scien-
tist particularly interested in astronomical and
cosmic research i have been studying his plan for
two days and the condensed report which he will
submit to the government and you will have ample
opportunity to do the same and form a picture of
what he is trying to accomplish for the present
elizabeth will administer to the needs of the cor-
poreal man    standerton has been racing
around up there in the skies for days and has solid
ground under him only now and then so rare an
occasion ought to be suitably celebrated

  elizabeth extended her tender little hand to the
giant in a manner frank and unembarrassed they
were good friends standerton-quil having worked
for many months at her fathers factory while the
first rocket-ships were under construction he had
been an almost daily guest but there was no rela-
tionship between them other than the platonic
his brain was too much a technical laboratory and
his heart too closely interwoven with his machines
and models for anything else

  subconsciously she drew a comparison between
the two men standing beside each other sharp as
the physical contrast was the spiritual difference
was fully as strong but she realized that the
tremendous plan of johannes baumgart whose
dreadful end she had visualized in so cruel a way
during their morning walk could be crowned with
success only if the technical ability and icy calm of
the huge engineer built and directed the machine
with which the plunge into the infinite was to be
attempted

  a moment later the idea of secretly persuading
the engineer to withdraw his support from the ad-
venture which might bring icarus fate upon baum-
gart shot through her head but then she realized
that it would be insanity for her to approach such
a man as standerton-quil with her girlish cares
he never would have understood them and she
would have laid bare the most secret emotions of
her heart to no purpose

  she left quietly to prepare the table

chapter xiii

an important conference

a heavy storm was gathering over the cape
the wind howled across the city from the
ocean blue-black clouds piled high and already in
the early afternoon the suns rays had been re-
placed by artificial lights nw and then the thun-
der rumbled and finally sheets of rain announced
that the beauty of the day was spoiled these en-

during heavy downpours mixed with considerable
masses of dust were coming more and more fre-
quently of late in northern europe they had be-
come a matter of course and it was beyond doubt
that the cosmic cloud was responsible for the phen-
omenon

  edward hawthorn appeared in his butlers pan-
try

  i shall have a very important conference on to-
night brown and i expect it to take up most of
the night i shall not be at home to anyone
furthermore all telephone lines are to be discon-
nected take down the calling number but strict-
ly refuse to make any connection take good care
of kowenkott the mechanic and see that he has all
the comforts and diversions he wants tomorrow
morning i will speak to him in person but for
tonight he will have to excuse mr standerton and
me

  old brown nodded silently he was used to exe-
cuting the wishes of his master with unconditional
accuracy hawthorn went on up into his office
outside the rain rustled and the wind whipped the
trees to and fro he switched on the light secured
cigarettes and a few good bottles arranged the
deep club chairs around the big table and glanced
over the afternoons mail

  baumgart and standerton arrived together at
four oclock the engineer was carrying the ger-
mans report under his arm enveloped in dense
clouds from his beloved pipe he had perused it
from the first word to the last with increasing in-
terest it was indeed a daring and original plan
carrying it out meant earning immortal fame and
losing the game meant losing life itself a thou-
sand difficulties never before surmounted re-
mained to be overcome and even the most insigni-
ficant details had to be brought out what people
called courage was a matter of course to stander-
ton-quil but he hated rashness which is the ene-
my of every great accomplishment he must be-
gin by acquainting himself with all the possibilities
in the coming interview

  no unnecessary words were exchanged they
seated themselves secured something to smoke and
a sip of wine and without formalities hawthorn
began the discussion

  you have read our guests prospectus stander-
ton

  with the most careful attention permit me
mr baumgart to make an introductory remark
right here to explain my position in the matter i
am a practical man an engineer no more i can
follow your ideas only from this narrow range
whether your theory is correct whether your
speculations regarding what you hope to find on the
moon are justified and whether humanity really
will derive advantages if you succeed in attaining
your goal i am in no position to judge

  much of this holds very little interest for me
to me the only question is the purely technical
side of the plan if you wished to deposit a pack-
age of sewing needles on the moon i would offer
my services with the same eagerness because it is
the technical problem that arouses my ambition
the technical problem is whether it is possible to
reach this neighboring world with our new usam-
baranite vehicle of course the success will be all
the cosmic cloud	

the more appreciated if humanity is the gainer
through your enterprise but the technical problem
remains unchanged whatever the result
baumgart smiled tjie man spoke exactly as he
had expected him to

  i thank you for the explanation of your concept
of the plan mr standerton and i may add that i
could not have desired anything better every
one of us must perform his particular share in this
difficult task and the technical man who loses him-
self in astronomico-philosophical theory which he
could consider only in a dilettante spirit would not
be the man we need build the space-ship with the
aid and support of mr hawthorn guide it to its
far-away destination and leave the rest to me
very good but now permit me a question it
is the most important question of all how do you
intend to test the power of your vehicle

  well we shall make a trial trip before the be-
ginning of the expedition proper and we will carry
it far beyond the atmosphere of the earth there
is no great risk in that we will be able to tell
immediately how our craft works then we will
glide down quite easily to earth

  i quite agree such a trial trip is indispensi-
ble now do you believe that this journey will be
possible

  before giving an opinion on that i should like
to question you about a number of details concern-
ing the distance to be travelled the amount of time
the journey should take and so forth until then
i can hardly examine the technical possibilities
you will permit me to make notes of the figures
you give me i hope  i will have to look them over
and check up on them more at my leisure to elim-
inate any possibilities of error for a very slight
one might be fatal

  baumgart produced a notebook filled with mathe-
matical formulae figures and diagrams written in
his narrow neat hand he drank a sip of wine
placed his cigarette in the ash-tray and began
you know that the moon is the heavenly body
nearest the earth the distance is a comparatively
small one astronomically speaking we know to-
day that the moon is a daughter of the earth the
substance of which it is formed was loosened from
our planet unthinkable ages ago while the earth
was still a red-hot sphere and broke loose because
of the rapidity of the earths rotation on its axis
in other words we know that the moon is made
of the same materials as the earth if i understand
you aright

jp orrect mr hawthorn the distance be-
vj tween moon and earth is known with great
accuracy it amounts to  kilometers and
we are quite sure that we need allow only  kilo-
meters of error a figure which makes very little
difference for our problem

  three hundred eighty-four thousand four hun-
dred thirty-five kilometers repeated standerton-
quil taking the figures down in his notebook

  right and this distance is comparatively
small thirty earths placed in line would fill the
gap the bullet of a hunting rifle would cover the
distance within nine days and almost all our sea-
captains have covered longer distances over the
ocean in the course of their lives it is only the

preconceived notion we have about bodies outside
the earth that gives us the idea that an impossible
gulf lies between us and the moon

  permit me to interrupt with a little improvised
calculation the velocity of the mark i usambar-
anite rocket is  kilometers an hour it would
therefore take  hours to get from here to the
moon with this vehicle-that is  days

  you are correct but the velocity of the rocket
in space would probably be greatly augmented over
its speed in the atmosphere for the substance of
the cosmic cloud is far thinner and thus a good deal
of the resistance to the motion of the vehicle is
eliminated

  unquestionably nevertheless let us base our
calculations on the most unfavorable case possible
to be certain of having an adequate factor of safe-
ty

  that is a thoroughly sound principle but the
vacuum of space and the absence of air on the
moon itself must play an important part in all our
calculations we must depend on what air we can
carry for the whole journey like a diver working
at the bottom of the sea for this reason i con-
sider it worth while to bring the point up now
that is another thing that will have to be tested
out to its last detail and rehearsed weeks before
our start interrupted the engineer we will
have to lock ourselves in an evacuated testing cham-
ber for days as they do in the diving schools and
finally for a week or more anyone unable to stand
it will be ineligible to join the expedition but
there is another question tell me mr baumgart
how about the weight of objects at the moon so
far as i know the moon is considerably smaller
than this planet and consequently everything is
considerably lighter there this is naturally very
important when we come to consider the return trip
from the moon i will require very careful infor-
mation on that point in order to make my calcu-
lations

  the conditions are these mr standerton-our
satellite bears about the same relation to the earth
that a cherry does to an apple the diameter is
four times smaller than that of the earth and one
could make approximately forty-nine moons out of
our planet all objects are therefore much lighter
there because the smaller body does not exercise
so great a gravitational pull a six-pound weight
weighs only one pound on the moon

  and since air resistance also is eliminated it
would be much easier to start the rocket from the
moon than from the earth just as it is easier to
pull a little steel spring from a small magnet than
from a large one

  as you say

  now suppose we reach the moon how long
would we have to remain there

  there are very definite limitations to that as
we are menaced equally by heat and cold as you
know every point on the moons surface has sun-
light for fourteen days and then night and extreme
cold for another fourteen days since there is no
protecting and balancing atmosphere the sun beats
down mercilessly on the dead stones so that the
heat may well reach  degrees centigrade or 
degrees fahrenheit during the moons night the
surface radiates its heat into cold space very rap-
	wonder stories quarterly

idly and is then exposed to interplanetary cold
which is as you know about  degrees below
zero centigrade we must expose ourselves to
neither extreme

  now said hawthorn i am really anxious to
know how you purpose to accomplish it

  its comparatively simple we will have to
make our landing on the moon at a point where day
and night meet in other words where the sun is
just descending then we will have a few bearable
hours before us when the cold becomes impos-
sible we will have to move on and make a new
landing at the point to which the sunset has gone
but perhaps the first landing will be sufficient to
tell me what i hope to discover

  at all events our sojourn there will not be ex-
tended beyond two or three days will it
positively no

  good now another particularly important
matter you understand we will have to use liquid
helium for the cooling of the combustion chambers
and exhausts which would otherwise become
white-hot in no time i am afraid we wont have
space enough to carry a supply sufficient for so long
a journey

  you wont need a single bottle of the cooling
fluid remember that space has a temperature of
 degrees below zero we will be travelling in
an immense refrigerator the temperature of which
is even below that of liquid helium which only gets
down to  below we shall need the heat devel-
oped in the combustion chambers in fact to keep
us warm

  excellent you seem to have planned every-
thing now permit me to glance over my figures
for a minute

standerton-quil began scattering formu-
lae and figures across his scratch pad his
companions watched him in silence until he put
down his pencil

  listen to how things look from the engineering
standpoint the journey to the moon will take
thirty-two days our stay there three days and
the return trip another thirty-two days all told
sixty-seven days to be on the safe side lets as-
sume seventy days naturally we will have to
have a double engine-room and control chamber
crew this means at least four persons you
yourself remain outside the calculation and are a
fifth passenger you like the rest of the crew will
have to be trained as steersman and mechanic to
give us a hand in case of emergency

  i have set down what the five people will need
in the way of food clothes blankets utensils com-
pressed air in steel tanks etc and i have also
calculated the total weight for these requirements
beds which are usually eliminated in short trips
here on earth will have to be added furthermore
there is the question of how much explosive we will
have to carry and finally here is the total weight
deduced from these figures it exceeds by a con-
siderable amount the capacity and pay load of our
largest rockets for this reason alone if for no
other the construction of a larger and special ve-
hicle is necessary it would also be advisable to
make the supporting planes larger and to install a
heating system which would lead the heat of the

combustion chambers to the other parts of the rock-
et in short the building of a special vehicle is a
primary requirement

  i though as much said hawthorn and it can
only be accomplished if the government foots the
bill i have no doubt about their doing it after
having been convinced of the practicability of your
plans and of the possibility that your theory with
regard to the moons past is correct it remains
for you to convince them we will support you in
this task with all our resources

  so you believe gentlemen that the journey
might be a success

  at all events it is worth trying
standerton-quil remained silent johannes
baumgart looked into his enigmatic vigorous face
he realized that everything depended upon this
mans decision standerton-quil looked straight
into emptiness then made a sudden gesture

  i am willing to support your plan what you
will find on the moon is almost immaterial to me
but i place myself at your disposal because the en-
gineering side of the question interests me it
would open an entirely new epoch of human acti-
vity a task for copernicus-a deed for colum-
bus standerton-quil has little to lose here on
earth i will steer the moon-rocket in person
my hand on it

  the three rose and shook each others hands
the engineer was as calm as before but across
baumgarts intellectual features passed a faint
blush of delight

  really gentlemen said hawthorn obviously
excited this is an important occasion a great
event in the history of mankind is taking place in
my humble home lets celebrate it with a good
drink in wine is strength and spirit and we shall
need both in our enterprise

  he filled the glasses and they toasted each other
there are still a thousand details to be thought
of and tried out remarked standerton i shall
have to work hard and carefully lest some ridicu-
lous triviality bring us to failure in case the gov-
ernment consents i shall have to resign my present
position and devote all my time to the great task
i must speak to you about many of the details
yet mr standerton we will have to go into all
the conditions and difficulties surrounding the jour-
ney one by one first there is the start from the
earth then the trip to the point where we enter the
moons field of gravity at that moment every-
thing will change for up to that moment we will
need power to place distance between ourselves
and the earth when the moons attraction be-
gins we will fall to its surface with ever-increasing
velocity

  true and from that moment on we will have
to turn the vehicle round pointing toward the
earth and decelerate our fall by retarding explo-
sions that is another thing that will have to be
gone into and the interior equipment of the rocket
constructed accordingly

  then there is the landing on the moon-a mo-
ment of great danger i would say- for we must
avoid damage to the machine later there will be
the start and the journey to the point where we
enter the earths gravitational field again and fin-
ally the landing on our planet after we have sur-

mounted all the dangers-if we are lucky

it will be just as well to set our affairs in order
before we leave the earth the fourth millennium
shall not find us less determined and self-sacrificing
than earlier ages found their explorers their
	wonder stories quarterly

missionaries or their soldiers

  well spoken standerton so let it be if you
like i will show you the calculations i have made
on these problems

  the gentlemen seated themselves again maps
and charts graphs and mathematical formulae soon
covered the table and all the details of the proposal
were discussed from every angle

  far into the night the three sat around their
table outside the rain rustled incessantly and
among the trees the powerful new lighthouse on the
cape blinked its message every two seconds   

  when hawthorn returned to his bedroom he saw
a shaft of light from his daughters room lying
along the floor of the rug-paved hall he knocked
gently at the door elizabeth opened it

  she looked into her fathers face flushed with
excitement as he entered and took her in his arms
you are still up my child

  she pointed to a book lying open beside her
chair it was volume i of baumgarts universal
law of life and death

  father what a man he is a master-mind i
could sit here till morning wandering through the
world of his thoughts

  my child a great idea has had its beginning
in our house as yet its full significance is hard-
ly conceivable standerton-quil thinks the jour-
ney possible and he himself will steer the space
ship to the moon

  elizabeth lowered her head so the thing that
had seemed inconceivable was to come true after
ail a wave of sadness swept over her the vis-
ion of destruction appeared once more before her
minds eye she was standing alone in a wide field
a burning body was tumbling downward a voice
of agony rang from the dark heights calling her
name and the charred remains fell to the stones
close beside her

  her arms sank limply to her sides she was
seized with a tremor and tears appeared in her
eyes she lay her head on her fathers broad chest

  the old man suddenly perceived in some indis-
tinct way the thought that was passing through
the mind of his child and a shadow fell on his de-
light

  he silently stroked his daughters hair she
pulled herself together squeezed his hand word-
lessly and hawthorn left the room almost as
though he were afraid to make a noise

chapter xiv
a world in ferment

it was a great day in the editorial offices of the
african herald the ten-story building with its
elaborate decoration and its white tiles glittered
in the sun like a flood of molten steel gushing from
the converter people swarmed about the place
dashing in and out where the great color-presses
were hammering the air hissing through the pneu-
matic tubes the wireless machines rattling and the
long distance telephones bringing important mes-
sages from all over the globe

  benjamin graachten himself was in zanzibar
and had since sunrise telephoned half a dozen im-
pressions no one could be sure of the mara-

bou for a single moment sobel the managing
editor snatched at his hair and raced to and fro
with fluttering coat-tails presently he was in the
telephone room where long phonograph cylinders
were taking messages automatically

  the impressions of graachten and the speech-
es of the president the ministers and the represen-
tatives far away in the parliament at zanzibar
were transferred here by the telephone the cy-
linders were despatched to the type-setting rooms
by pneumatic tubes there the speeches were re-
vived and transmuted into type

  speech of the president second cylinder re-
marked the young lady at the beginning of a cylin-
der she opened the pneumatic tube to compos-
ing room no  and with a hissing sound dismissed
the object into the depths

  how many altogether asked sobel

  twenty-three so far

  has ismail chaks report-or rather that of his
secretary hamadan-arrived yet

  not yet

 its about time said sobel mopping his drip-
ping forehead with a handkerchief and rushing
away a few seconds later he appeared in the
telephotography department electrical impulses
were arriving here over a net of wires impulses
which had originally been light at the far-away
starting point and which through selenium cells
had been transformed into impulses of varying
strength according to the shape and brightness of
the pictures in the distance

  these wires led to a huge screen of frosted glass
behind which burned thousand of tiny bulbs oper-
ated by the current which came through the wires
from far away with the speed of thought itself
each one of these little lamps illuminated a tiny
section of the white screen glowing feebly strongly
or going out altogether according to the brightness
of the picture at the starting point in zanzibar or
elsewhere thus a multitude of ever-changing
bright and dark little spots were reproduced on the
screen which occupied a whole wall in an enormous
dark room they reproduced the very picture
which at the point of origin had been caught by the
eye of the selenium transmitter

  a motion picture camera photographed this
screen incessantly picture after picture was pro-
duced and dispatched to the art department from
whence it proceeded to the engraving department
after a few moments and in another hour or two
it was printed and in the hands of the readers
at times the pictures were seen by distant readers
before the citizens of the place where the events
were transferring

  sobel blinked his short-sighted eyes and focussed
them on the screen the picture presented was
somewhat indistinct it showed the interior of the
parliament hall and the speakers tribune a beau-
tiful woman was speaking accompanying her
words with active gestures in one hand she seemed
to be waving a newspaper but the precise details
were not discernible in the background cornelius
van zuylen motionless in his seat was visible his
white hair forming the brightest spot in the pic-
ture

  have the pictures of the arrival of the president
and councillors gone to the art department yet
the cosmic cloud	

  yes half an hour ago

  is there a picture of mme khadija effrera-
latour among them and is it a good one

  its perfect she stood for some time at the
foot of the stairway in conversation with another
lady the presidents picture also is particularly
good there must be bright sunlight in zanzi-
bar everything is clear and contrasting

  good did you get mr graachten too

  he got there a little late came with secretary
hamadan good picture he saw the camera
and turned toward it lifting his hat then the
telephone department switched the picture over to
the interior of the chamber and we couldnt get
any more of him hell be annoyed about it you
know how vain the old man is sobel

  sobel soo-bell good morning for the fourth
time this is a big day for us sobel huge sen-
sation in the senate mme khadija has stuck the
moon affair article under the ministers noses
sobel man imagine the african herald getting the
story before the government get it into the noon
edition right away got that good have you
heard about the billion francs for a good idea on
beating the cosmic cloud use that as your lead
and head-billions for brains or something like
that ill have to ring off now sobel the govern-
ment is after more information about the german
and wants to know his address so long

the overworked editor fluttered off again to give
the copy-desk graachtens instructions
airplanes were landing on the big roof of the
herald building messengers dashed about fast
autos were racing through the streets artists writ-
ters reporters and senators unable to get to the
session for one reason or another were obtaining
first-hand information again and again new pic-
tures long distance calls wireless messages re-
ports impressions and speeches rolled in until the
moment of going to press arrived and all further
details were held for the next edition

  sobel threw himself on the couch in his office
cut off all communicating apparatus and slept the
sleep of the just the subeditors one by one
meandered up to the roof-garden in their shirt-
sleeves where they lolled about in the comfortable
chairs smoking cigarettes and cursing all the elec-
tric apparatus that glittered about them they
had an hour for recuperation during which no news
was racing along the wires of their nerves and no
new picture registering on their brain-cameras
for that one hour they lay in the sun day-dream-
ing

  meanwhile down in the press-rooms there was a
prodigious rattle hum and clash of presses three
million copies of the african herald were being
prepared to descend on a waiting world a small
army of young and old white and black was al-
ready congregated in the side-street waiting for
the bundles of papers which would pour from the
delivering apparatus like water from a faucet
soon the whole troop was racing like a paper hur-
ricane through streets railroad stations offices
apartment houses stores and restaurants

  airplanes swung off with their loads of papers
to drop them in other cities thence to return for a
new cargo high-speed electric railroads carried

more bundles into the distance far away to the
quiet lakes and the loneliness of the tropical jun-
gles to the pasturelands of the plains and to the
tom canyons of the mining districts an ocean
of paper was flooding the whole continent and fast
vessels carrying more to other continents

	  

  when the first copy of the issue arrived at the
villa hawthorn where the three gentlemen were
again seated around their table intent on their
discussion it created a sensation the manager of
the usambaranite factory glanced hastily over the
still moist sheets headlines glared at him

great session of the senate at
zanzibar

        speech of his excellency the president - greet-
        ings from the president of europe - immigration
        of  europeans - billions for brains -
        mme effrem-latour supports german scientists
        plan - expedition to the moon planned - gov-
        ernment will consider plan - peelings high in
        zanzibar - heavy rains and snows in europe

  gentlemen said hawthorn pleasurably ex-
cited the indiscretion which revealed our plans
may not turn out so badly after all imagine
they have already considered it at the extraordin-
ary session and the temperamental effrem-latour
has laid a lance in rest for you mr baumgart
congratulations seem to be in order khadija is
one of the best brains in africa now lets see
what happened in zanzibar while we were going
into the technical side of our problem yesterday
he unfolded the paper and read the almost word-
for-word report of the extraordinary session

  johannes baumgart listened attentively how
strange that of all people a woman and daughter
of the desert should be the first person publicly to
favor his plan-a woman who had never met him
and of whom he knew nothing standertons deep
laugh over the debate between the senator and sir
archibald plug roused him from his reverie

  this plug is the limit he would be perfectly
capable of fulfilling his promise and going with us
to the moon and he would be far from the worst
man for the job an old experienced navigator
he would make a good steersman and substitute for
me he was one of the first men to make a flight
with me in the rocket-car on the long trip across
the ocean and he knew just what to do about navi-
gating the craft

  hawthorn lowered the paper heres a picture
of your spokesman a dangerous beauty young
and agile like one of those desert cats and probably
just as easy to deal with

  baumgart inspected the picture he had ex-
pected a woman of the elderly serious type-in-
stead he beheld the portrait of an elegant young
beauty with refined features and clever bright
eyes had he foreseen that he would meet her in a
few hours it would have both disquieted and con-
fused him he fell into a brown study by this
time the zanzibar government must have received
his telegram explaining the account of his ideas
in the african herald as a betrayal which had come
about in some inexplicable manner and asking per-
mission to submit his plan there in person the
summons to zanzibar might arrive at any moment

  and as a matter of fact the governments re-
quest was on hand by the second hour of the after-
	wonder stories quarterly

noon as baumgart was returning from an inspec-
tion of the usambaranite works with hawthorn
albarnell minister of science had taken it upon
himself to invite him he had already discovered
the residence of the german through benjamin
graachten and the arrival of baumgarts telegram
gave him a welcome opportunity to get the matter
started and avoid a second reproach for tardiness
and lack of information    the conversation
was a long one albarnell demanded a brief out-
line of the chief points involved

  it is he said my intention to call a special
session of the ministry and the councillors and you
will be given an opportunity to outline your plans
with greater thoroughness it will have to taki
place soon since a number of the gentlemen are
remaining here for this purpose alone at the
same time i will have the necessary technical ex-
perts on hand to give an opinion on your idea

baumgart explained the most important
points in broad outline being careful to men-
tion that he had discussed the problem tvith two
eminent engineers and was sure of their support

  in that case i will ask you the minister re-
plied to invite those two gentlemen to the session
to give us their views everything else will be
taken care of here and i hope it will be agreeable
to you if i set the time for the discussion for june
th in the morning-in other words three days
from now

  baumgart was delighted by this quick action
he felt that his stock was rising his great idea
was gaining credence among the leaders and
among the masses it excited attention the ex-
pressions from the famous director of the cape
town observatory were disapproving but he hoped
to convince even this man rawlinson for the man
in view of his great reputation might become a
dangerous adversary

  his own straightforward character would keep
him from interviewing the obviously despotic scien-
tist in his observatory and flattering him into a
more favorable attitude if he could not win by
the sheer strength of his proofs he would simply
have to wait for better times he experienced a
feeling of power for years he had been occupied
with the thorough study of all questions bearing on
this subject he had considered all the advantages
and disadvantages and even the most experienced
astronomer was hardly proof against the errors
that arise from insufficient research into a specific
problem he would be able to find advocates

  in fact he had already found one advocate mme
effrem-latour felt that the plan she had mentioned
before the parliament might become highly import-
ant but might also if injudiciously handled en-
danger her reputation as a brilliant member of the
senate her ambitious energy would not permit
her to let any chance of action go by she had seen
the world-famous editor-in-chief of the african
herald sitting at the reporters table and counted
on meeting him after the session in the lobby the
old marabou was thoroughly pleased with him-
self his paper had given the signal for a battle
of minds on a question of high importance-reason
enough for a smile to melt the usual ice of his
features

  he was obviously flattered when the beautiful
khadija made her way toward him his profuse
compliments were received with some coolness

  tell me mr graachten how did you get the
news did you squeeze it out of the scientist him-
self

  why no madame as a matter of fact its a
trade secret of the newspaper game which unfor-
tunately i cannot reveal

  ah it must have sneaked into your office while
you were asleep

  well the news that comes in the regular way
is usually tin-can stuff and no paper can live on
such a diet

but you know the gentlemens address at least
by luck i do i have just turned it over to the
ministry-that is to mr albarnell this german
scientist is staying at the home of the manager of
the usambaranite works in cape town at present
ill look him up on the dot

  will you do me the honor of joining me in my
airplane i am leaving in two hours you will
save time and have an excellent travelling com-
panion

  with pleasure mr graachten but let me in-
form you in the beginning that you will get no
chance to slaughter me journalistically

  the marabou laughed oh im not worry-
ing may i offer you a cigarette they are no
worse than those one gets in alexandria or cairo
khadija effrem-latour reached daintily for the
extended case the marabou gallantly offered
her a light sir archibald plug passed by at the
moment dont smoke so much madame its
bad for the eyes now if you only used snuff like
me you would have a fabulously clear mind-also
like me

  laughingly they stepped outdoors and chatter-
ing happily the three descended the broad stairs at
the foot of which the great fountain was tossing
its veils of water into the sunlight-filled air that
studded them with diamonds

  from her hotel the senator had a call put
through to the cairo observatory abdul ben-
haffa the director was a good friend of hers and
she had always taken the side of his institution
when the question of research appropriations came
up she wanted an opinion from him on the ger-
mans plans

  after a long wait dr ben-haffas voice finally
came from the instrument

  madame effrem oh good morning i hope
you have a pleasant morning there here we have
had three days of rain the sun is shining give
the sun my best regards were condemned to idle-
ness up here since he has turned his back on us
its just my luck to be an astronomer on the earth
during an ice-age of all possible times and to
what do i owe the honor of your call

  she told him the story explained the germans
idea and told about the discussion of the matter
at the extraordinary session

  well what do you think of it

  madame effrem its a very difficult question to
discuss a multitude of highly technical questions
are involved i personally have never doubted
that our satellite once had a period of life such as
our globe has today and moreover i believe that
the cosmic cloud	

lately i have discovered traces of past human acti-
vity on the moon only our new giant reflector
will be able to settle the question it is quite pos-
sible therefore that man will find what he expects
on the moon

  but what good is it if one cant reach the
moon-which seems a certainty at least i am
unable to see any possibility of bridging the gap
small as the distance from the earth to the moon
is it is not even fifty times as great as the dis-
tance from algiers to cape town

  in other words this is the weak point in your
germans theory and unless he is a pure romancer
i would like to hear how he expects to accomplish
such a journey i think its impossible but the
other idea lies well within the bounds of plausibil-
ity undoubtedly well hear more about the affair
and i will very likely be called in when the govern-
ment comes to consider his plans

  mme effrem-latour thanked him and bade him
goodbye she must see this german in person and
lay her course according to the result of the inter-
view the newspaper mans airplane would leave
in an hour next day she would be in cape town
and could form a personal estimate rawlinsons
view in the herald had been disapproving and ben-
haffa thought the journey impossible    this
hardly looked encouraging

  an hour later she was seated at graachtens side
in the cabin of the little plane across whose wings
the words african herald-cape town were
painted in gigantic red letters they soared rap-
idly upward the sun-drenched equatorial lands dis-
appeared behind them and a few hours later the
african south rose before them announcing its
presence with low-hanging clouds and rain-showers

chapter xv

baumgard and effrem-latour

hawthorn reclined comfortably in his chair
dinner was over elizabeth placed liqueurs
and cigars on the table

  this is just the right kind of evening for a
talk these endless rains drive one to despair i
can imagine how the people in northern europe and
asia and the inhabitants of the southern part of
america feel with dense enow falling incessantly
and so low a temperature that free movement is an
impossibility

  baumgart nodded silently he looked into eli-
zabeths quiet face there seemed something sor-
rowful there tonight he thought of the last sun-
ny morning when they had visited greenpoint to-
gether

  standerton-quil was more lying than sitting in
his comfortable chair by the fireplace if you
dont mind miss hawthorn he said with a smile
i shall light up the old pipe its a vice but the
virtuous non-smoker is a thorough prig

  puff away to your hearts desire mr stander-
ton it doesnt bother me you smoke a pipe
father his cigars and mr baumgart and i will keep
going on our cigarettes it will result in a queer
mixture of smells

  have you ever noticed said baumgart coming
out of his thoughts that the way a man smokes

gives one a good line on his character take for
instance our little group-the pipe is a powerful
smoke and only the strong man can stand it as a
steady diet it requires the best of treatment and
a certain attention to its technical details thats
why a man like our friend standerton smokes one
a cigar burns quietly evenly and for a long time
permitting leisurely consideration and makes little
trouble with its ashes and sparks doesnt this fit
our hosts character to a t on the other hand
there is something nervous about the cigarette it
burns out fast quickly ignited and as quickly extin-
guished its the hasty brief enjoyment of the
restless and i wont deny that i fill the part
very nice figure mr baumgart do you know
one of my greatest worries is how we are going to
make a seventy-day trip without smoking ill
have to get used to chewing tobacco like a sailor
one more reason for not making the trip at all
said elizabeth in a tone between jesting and ear-
nestness

  you have an aversion to this trip miss haw-
thorn i have known it since the subject was first
broached

  is it so astonishing that i should mr stander-
ton its a journey into ghastly uncertainty into
a world on which nature has set the locks of unsur-
mountable difficulties and which now offers as our
guest believes a brief and dangerous thoroughfare
for the first time man should not set himself
against the gods i dare hardly think of the fut-
ure who knows   

   brown the butler entered and offered a visiting
card hawthorn took it and held it within the cir-
cle of the light

  khadija effrem-latour member of the senate
of the united states of africa he read parlia-
mentary representative of the nila district   
an interesting guest you will meet a remarkable
personality mme effrem-latour is the lady who
brought your plan to the attention of the session
what does she want i wonder im sure its some-
thing about the idea that ha us all on edge   
show the lady in brown

  elizabeth turned the ceiling lights on and the
coziness of the smaller lamps gave place to brilliant
illumination

  mme effrem-latour entered the room a close-
fitting dark blue travelling dress enveloped her per-
fect figure and accentuated the already striking
complexion high brown shoes did not impair the
grace of the well-proportioned and dainty feet a
thin dark-blue flying net kept the shimmering dark
hair in place hawthorn crossed the room toward
her with his hand extended the others rose eli-
zabeth remaining in the background watching the
clever well-shaped face of the famous woman

  welcome to my house madam i regret that
you had to arrive at the cape while such a deluge
is going on my daughter elizabeth will be glad to
offer you anything you need

  thank you mr hawthorn i came directly
from zanzibar from the zambesi on we had con-
tinual rain we were flying low and even then
couldnt make out the route signals very well our
pilot got lost near pretoria and we had to take
wireless compass bearings when we were near-
ing cape town we almost collided with another
	wonder stories quarterly

airplane at three thousand feet in short we had
a thoroughly unpleasant time

  elizabeth laughed her silvery laughter may i
offer you something in the way of refreshment
no thanks i arrived two hours ago and stop-
ped at the hotel to powder my nose and take a bite
unfortunately my time is rather limited and i had
to bother you tonight my visit is about the in-
teresting guest whom your roof is now sheltering
permit me to introduce the man of the hour
in person

  baumgart stepped forward and made his bow
he was as embarrassed as a schoolboy as this fash-
ionable woman stepped impulsively toward him ex-
tending her hand

  i am glad sir to reach you before the govern-
ment extracts all the essential information from
you your plans have been my preoccupation for
thirty-six hours and have brought me really quite
a headache i presume you have seen in the papers
that i brought your plan up on the floor of the
house meanwhile i have talked to some of the
experts and i regret to say they think the project
impossible i couldnt stand the suspense any
longer and i simply had to come hear you see you
and speak to you you will probably think me
frightfully impulsive but its an inborn character-
istic that i dont try to curb

baumgart felt more and more uncomfortable
the overwhelming femininity of this beautiful
and remarkable woman confused him and he was
some time in collecting his scattered senses

  i regret madame that you had to go through
such a journey on my account it would have been
my first duty to look you up after the splendid
way you stood up for me in the session and i would
have done that on the eighteenth when i am going
to zanzibar to see some of the government officials
i will be very glad to give you information enough
to disperse your doubts and i hope that you wont
leave here before we convince you that i am not
submitting any airy chimera to the high parliament
of africa

  mr baumgart i would be most happy to have
you do it since otherwise i am afraid i would have
to disavow you in the parliament however one
of my vices is temperament another one is reckless
candor i will support your plans eagerly if they
appear to me and to the experts as possible of exe-
cution but i promise you i will oppose them just
as vigorously if they are not

  madame i could have expected no more from
you your responsible office would make such an
action your duty

  can you spare me a little time tomorrow morn-
ing then

  it would be a high honor

  and now i wont disturb your nice little party
any longer

  oh we couldnt permit that madame said
hawthorn extending his arms as though trying to
prevent her escape you will insult my humble
home if you wont join me over a glass of wine
she laughed again all right but only on con-
dition that the gentlemen return to their tobacco
and permit me to smoke a papyrus

  the permission was granted amid acclamation

they seated themselves around the fireplace the
rain pattered on the windows again and the wind
tore at the frames hawthorn filled the glasses as
the senator chatted with standerton-quil about the
journey to the north making highly pessimistic
comments on the habitability of northern europe
and the burden it would throw on the africans

  baumgart listened dreamily casting side-glances
at the charming profile of the daughter of the nile
on which the fire threw irregular lights he failed
to observe that elizabeth whose blonde beauty was
paled before this brilliant apparition as the moon
gives way before the sun was looking at him with
an expression of melancholy strange thoughts
passed through elizabeths head how differently
this woman who radiated such energy and beauty
who showed such an intelligent grasp of large prob-
lems must appear to the man whose heart she had
won in a few days without being aware of it

  she felt that her own weakness her willingness
to prevent the great design made her appear very
insignificant but at least there was one thing in
her favor-she loved the man who wished to dare
the fates the other woman did not alas was this
not only another manifestation of weakness and
smallness a khadija effrem-latour would have
stepped up to him and said i love you i want you
you shall make me happy let your plans drop
dont you yourself say that the world runs on in
accordance with eternal laws  why do you whom
i love why do you wish to interfere with this
clock-work world the wheels of which will go on
their eternal way by themselves

  your plan may succeed but there is great dan-
ger in it danger which will in all probability cost
me my life and happiness and you yours it is not
a vain desire for fame that pushes you forward on
your adventurous course it is love of mankind of
all these masses who expect something startling
they only want a sensation even a gruesome one
and they do not love you as i do we have but one
life and it passes swiftly come let us live it to-
gether

  was it not a pinched feminine indecisiveness that
kept her from speaking as the other woman would
perhaps the day would come when this daughter of
a brighter sun would speak to her man this way-
to this man who was so different from other men
in his thoughts feelings introspectiveness and in-
tellectual achievement this man with all his boyish
timidity his girlish shyness

  perhaps the day would come when this beautiful
and brilliant woman would with her quick decisive-
ness conquer the heart of the silent man from the
far north and she elizabeth hawthorn would have
to step back into the loneliness of her room with
empty hands yet there was something which told
her that there were hardly two people on earth less
suited to each other than this woman and this man
she glanced shyly at them meditating

around the fireplace the conversation had turned
to politics the young senator expressed the idea
that all governments did only the things that should
have been done yesterday and would be anachron-
isms tomorrow she compared government to a
man striving to run behind the car of progress on
a pair of clumsy crutches and who is always being
the cosmic cloud	

kept behind by irregularities in the road which he
fails to foresee

  it is the misfortune of governments said
baumgart in his deep quiet voice that they learn
nothing from the laws of nature thus far people
have failed to perceive that states nations and cul-
tures develop like living organisms like trees and
that human history is not beyond the bounds of pre-
diction

  i dont quite understand what you are driving
at mr baumgart

t et me illustrate with an example madame

  i	 all nature is ruled by a final law-that of
birth and death immutable natural forces build
and destroy plants and animals men and stars
all these creations of nature spring from seeds
grow ripen reach a climax and then die away
just as the petals of a flower are blown away and
life dies from the plant so man dies and all the
animals and in this way the greatest of the suns
must one day cool off

  now we are obviously in a position to predict
the evolution of an oak and of a man even when
both of them are in their most youthful state we
know of a boy that he will grow ripen into man-
hood marry become the sire of children that he
will age and die from his earliest days in home
and school we try to give him the necessary equip-
ment to help him do justice to all the phases of his
existence

  a state is nothing but an enlarged type of or-
ganism for them as well the universal law of life
holds true a conspectus of the history of nations
shows them to have developed along exactly simi-
lar lines and to have perished in a manner strik-
ingly alike all had a primitive infancy an
awakening to power struggles with neighboring
peoples religious upheavals social revolutions time
of efflorescence and period of downfall preceded
by a period of interior decay and followed by a
shrinking into insignificance

  the drama has repeated itself innumerable
times and will continue to do so like the cycle of
growth and decay among the trees of a forest
thus the history of a nation can also be outlined
and many a misfortune in the lives of nations would
be prevented if the leaders of the people would con-
sider this process of evolution

  the senator had listened attentively this man
certainly looked at things from a broad viewpoint
these ideas were new to her and she was forced to
admit that they gave her a vista down new lanes
of thought and would be of use to her in her office

  very good sir i feel that you have said some-
thing profoundly true one could almost wish that
you would set down this theory of history in a book
and develop it into a theory of statesmanship

  it has been done already hawthorn interject-
ed the third volume of our friends work goes
into these questions very thoroughly

  can i persuade you to make this book available
for me mr baumgart

it is at your disposal at any time madame
without wishing to flatter our friend to his
face remarked standerton knocking out his pipe
on the brickwork of the fireplace he penetrates to
the nucleus of thoughts in a most remarkable way

and in a manner quite foreign to us you mad-
ame will discover tomorrow that his speculations
of which we have demonstrated the technical prac-
ticability after some investigation are perfectly
right we that is mr hawthorn and i are per-
fectly ready to stand up for him at the great coun-
cil when it meets on the eighteenth

  so you are already invited

  yes by mr albarnell himself

  well then i propose that we make the journey
to zanzibar together

   if you are willing to be the first woman to over-
come the prejudice against the rocket and entrust
yourself to the machine

  since you all wish to travel to the moon in the
same monster and i am supposed to be supporting
your plan i seem to have no resource but to deliver
myself into your hands

  bravo madame you may be sure that we will
land you safe at bagamojo what would become of
the nile district if its representative perished
you are laughing at me now mr hawthorn
khadija effrem-latour is not always persona grata
to the descendants of the dutch and english we
must surmount many barriers before attaining full
equality of rights

  i beg you madame take it out on sir archibald
and spare us your shafts

  you see mr baumgart that my reputation is
that of a political xantippe a thousand years of
the political activity of women have not been
enough to extinguish old prejudices in the brains
of these men they cannot escape the idea that a
woman is a being subordinate to them and they
think it a humiliation if the other half of humanity
wishes to have anything to say in deciding affairs of
state this is the basis of the only real idea my ex-
cellent friend sir archibald plug who is a marvel-
lous man and the most polite cavalier you could
imagine outside parliament ever speaks about
you know mr hawthorn i am going to marry that
old sea-dog some day and tame my adversary
forever

  she laughed again exposing two rows of pearls
in the process

  oh we implore you not to do that the quality
of the debates in the senate would decline consid-
erably if your quarrels ceased and the wonderful
plug would die of melancholy if he lost his charm-
ing adversary for i doubt whether he would get
a chance to conduct debates at home-especially as
your husband

   i dont know said the beautiful khadija giving
a sly side-glance at the old gentleman whether to
take that as a compliment or the reverse

  how could you think such a thing why-
lets let it go at that im used to arguments
and the salt of humor keeps the heart fresh as an
old proverb of my part of the country says

  the political activity of women interposed
baumgart has in my opinion not fulfilled our best
expectations woman if you will permit me to
make the remark with the understanding that it
has no personal application has stepped into the
arena fighting political wars in the old-established
fashion of man she has hardly enriched political
life with a new spirit we expected an exhibition
of the specifically feminine influence but she mere-
	wonder stories quarterly

ly decked herself in the old armor of man   
how much has masculine stubbornness and hard-
ness been guilty of in the political lives of nations
especially in older times when the sword was al-
ways loose in the scabbard how much the doc-
trine of an eye for an eye has injured our social
structure  we expected that woman would
show more kindness love and maternal understand-
ing thus reconciling ancient grudges by compro-
mise on both sides

  but look back through your histories you will
find that nothing of the kind has happened and
that woman has been more intolerant more domin-
eering more reckless and more cruel than man
considering this i have been forced to an unfavor-
able conclusion with regard to feminine political
activity from an entirely different direction than
sir archibald plug and other politicians woman
has not been a good samaritan in the political bat-
tle  she has discarded the nurses uniform and the
medical kit for the sword no wonder then that
she must face swords at the present time

  there is a good deal of truth in what ybu say
and i am candid enough to admit that the modern
woman in public life has lost a good deal of her
fineness in this battle not everyone who remains
on the battle-field crowned with the bays of vic-
tory wins happiness

  a strangely serious expression had darkened the
features of the beautiful young woman and the
feeling that she was perhaps not quite as joyous as
she appeared at a distance could hardly be avoided

  madame rose it was late she extended her
hand in farewell to the gentlemen and to the
strangely quiet girl who had retained her place in
the shadow mme effrem-latour glanced at her
searchingly and the two pairs of eyes met each
other for a moment-the dark sparkling pair and
the lighter ones which did not bear the brunt of
this ocular combat then the senator turned and
left the room escorted by hawthorn 

chapter xvi

baumgart presents his plan

with a rattling noise the glittering steel bird
shot up into grey air filled with a fine inces-
sant rain the wings trembled slightly amid the
downpour across which they cut in fiat curves and
the guy-wires hummed like harpstrings the pas-
sengers waiting at the electric railroad station of
old fort gazed up into the grey permitting the
rain to beat on their faces for a moment as they
stared at the new means of transportation pre-
sently it was shrinking to a dot in the distance
obscured by the drizzle

  elizabeth stepped back from the balcony into her
room folding the telescope she would be all alone
for a few days tomorrow morning at the govern-
ment palace in zanzibar the question which had so
suddenly entered her quiet life would be decided
her father johannes baumgart standerton-quil
and khadija were now racing at  kilometers an
hour toward the equator only an hour ago the
interesting senator had taken her hand in fare-
well her last words still sounded in elizabeths
ears

  you are harboring a rare man in your house
miss hawthorn i really envy you this morn-
ing i have been following his work with the closest
attention if you play up to his thoughts he will
end by making a philosopher of you i am glad
that i can rob you of this man who has so much
to give for a few days and i hope you will not be-
grudge me a pittance from the riches of his com-
pany that you enjoy

  her answer had been somewhat curt-a mixture
of embarrassment an anxiety not to betray her
inmost feelings and a desire not to be enemies a
melange of feelings which fitted but ill this girl
with the pure clear eyes and which such a judge
of mankind as the beautiful senator could not but
read aright

  with the easy manner of a woman of the world
she had shaken the hand of the daughter of the
house thanked her for her hospitality and walked
out in her proud vigorous way to join the men who
awaited her to begin the long race through fog and
rain high over mountains and streams the sus-
picion of a smile lurked in her eyes the smile of the
skilled warrior who certain of victory awaits the
arrival of his nervous and inexperienced adversary

  then they swung out into the swimming grey
with a rattle of explosions beneath them the land-
scape flashed by indistinctly blotted into a mono-
tone by the persistent fog new landscapes rose
from the towering rock walls before them a cer-
tain feeling of restlessness embraced the travellers
for the first time imprisoned in the racing projec-
tile the drone of the explosions beat upon the
ear-drums protected though they were by sound-
dampers and the vibration and occasional sharp
shocks of the machine gave a sensation of insecur-
ity this vanished little by little and baumgart as
well as his companions found the old saying that
familiarity breeds contempt confirmed

  as they proceeded toward the equator the skies
slowly took on more and more brightness here
the old sun ruled its ancient domain driving back
the ocean of cloud with his light-arrows and
brought into being huge air-currents flowing north
and south electrically charging the dust at high
altitudes

  the weather was superb when they landed at
bagamojo in the first beams of the searchlights

	  

  again a new and radiant day rose over the earth
setting the gilded dome of the parliament house
alight once more the flashing drops of the foun-
tain broke in rainbow colors once again the sta-
tue of the great van der valk saw the councillors
and senators of the nation pass by toward the
stately colonnade and once again the high coun-
cillors were to decide on an important project

   this time the session was to be held in the small-
er auditorium as the members of parliament were
represented only by a committee the president
also was absent his secretary took his place the
ministerial benches were fully occupied and of the
councillors and senators not one had excused him-
self

  at the left in the foreground were the green
seats of the visiting technical experts dr raw-
linson of the cape observatory was there and not
far from him abdul ben-haffa from cairo van-
the cosmic cloud	

derstrassen the geologist was seated between
them while hawthorn and standerton-quil had
taken seats in the back rows two other engineers
from the governmental plants were present and
just before them was the bald head of jussuf dram-
men the famous lecturer on aerodynamics at the
university of timbuctoo it had been thought
wise to call in a few outstanding physicians and
physicists as well and in addition jerubi cochem
director of the government bureau of cultural re-
search

  in front all alone on a small platform sat joh-
annes baumgart with an air of nervousness he
stroked back his obstinate hair and wiped his glass-
es his fine face was slightly pale mr praga
the european ambassador made his way to the
front and shook the hand of the scientist

  among the senators mme effrem-latour en-
gaged in eager conversation with mme birrha and
ismail chak were visible sir archibald plug and
senator umaruru were discussing the new immi-
gration statistics which they had just received

  on the stroke of ten samuel machai opened the
session with a brief address and turned the floor
over to the minister of science mr albarnell the
latter gave a brief review of the matters to be dis-
cussed and reminded the experts according to the
prescribed form to let the interests of the state
be their sole guide in their deliberations he then
presented johannes baumgart to the gathering and
gave him the floor for the exposition of his ideas

the german rose flattened out his notes and
began

  ministers councillors and senators ladies and
gentlemen the calamity which has befallen our
planet compels us to think of ways and means to
overcome its consequences thus far no measure
which will afford protection against existing and
approaching conditions has been discovered we
must not lose sight of the fact that these conditions
will increase in severity that we are only approach-
ing the central sections of the cosmic cloud and we
may expect it to become more dense and we will be
exposed to its effects for another two millennia

  in putting forward the suggestion of obtaining
from a neighboring and uninhabited heavenly body
information that will help us i am aware that the
idea will cause some perplexity and i offer an ex-
planation of why after long years of study i have
reached the conclusion that it is really practicable

 the most recent astronomical and cosmic inves-
tigations have confirmed the idea on which we have
been speculating for more than a thousand years-
namely that all heavenly bodies go through a regu-
lar evolutionary process not widely different in
character from that which plants and animals go
through every heavenly body comes into being
through the concretion of immense masses of gas
and dust similar to those which now surround us

  these masses become more and more condensed
and the condensation causes a rise in temperature
until the sphere of gas and dust becomes a lumin-
ous sun all stars are such glowing gaseous
spheres including our own sum our earth and
moon inconceivable ages ago were such suns
though considerably smaller than the one which
now furnishes us with light

  but these balls of fire float in the immense cold
of space lose their heat by radiation and are bound
to become slowly colder and finally to go out like
pieces of coal which drop from the blacksmiths
forge white-hot to cool down ultimately through
the red stage to black all the great suns of the
universe follow the same course during the cen-
turies white suns grow yellowish then reddish and
finally a thick solid crust forms about them they
go out and become cold in this way the earth ac-
quired its covering and our sun also will some
day be covered by a mantle of stone    the cold
of space is death to the suns

  as i have remarked the earth and moon are
of the same character when the glowing earth
went out and locked itself in its armor of petrified
materials the temperature slowly fell to a point
where atmosphere which enclosed our planet could
eliminate the water it contained in tremendous
rains the masses of water descended upon the still
heated crust to form small oceans were vaporized
again and descended once more only to return in
this state our fellow-planets jupiter and saturn
still are today

  at last the tepid oceans found a lodgement on
the earth a single ocean engulfed the whole plan-
et slowly the air was cleared and for the first
time the light of the sun which before could not
penetrate the mantle of steam reached the earth
for the first time there was day and night

  the cooling process continued as a drying
apple shrinks because its skin has become too great
for the diminishing water so the skin of the earth
folded and mountains and valleys came into being
the first islands reared up from the ocean to be
followed by entire continents the warm water
leached out the stones forming a slime and where
the waters retreated in various places the former
bed of the ocean became visible as a sandy plain
thus the earth slowly acquired its present surface
formation

 already in the primitive oceans lowly forms of
life had appeared how it came into existence we
do not know even now but very likely the original
germs of life were borne here from other heavenly
bodies mingled with the dust of space slowly life
developed through higher forms until it reached
the peak-man

  the moon has gone through the same process
of evolution we can see on its surface today the
remains of dried-up oceans and the bones of mighty
mountains but all are dead while jupiter and
saturn show us the past of the earth the moon
gives us a picture of its future this smaller
sphere cooled off sooner died long before at a
time when the earth was not even inhabited lun-
arian life had already passed its apogee when
the earth first bore life the moon was already in
the death-throes consider those animals who live
only a few weeks and the others whose span of life
is very long-the galapagos tortoises for instance
similarly various heavenly bodies have different
lengths of life

  the moon is a fragment of the earth once up-
on a time the mass which now forms its substance
was ejected from the equator of our planet it con-
sists therefore of the same materials as this earth
and the same natural forces operated and are oper-
	wonder stories quarterly

ating there as here on that world the nearest
of all to ours the nuclei of life once took possession
and there too they developed according to the laws
of the universe thus on the moon also a race
not widely different from the human must have
lived during its great period but today water and
air have vanished from their world

  how did this come about well ladies and
gentlemen the water was absorbed by the rock
formations seeping down into deep fissures and
combining chemically with the mass thus disap-
pearing the molecules of the air were diffused
into space thus the moon became uninhabitable

t ut other reasons brought about the death of
j the moon before the air was lost the moon
now takes a full month to revolve on its axis
every point on its surface has fourteen times
twenty-four hours of day and an equal length of
night once upon a time the lunarian day was
brief shorter than the earthly one today i shall
not bother you with the details but for a long time
we have known that the powerful attraction of the
earth has slowly decelerated the moons rotation
now imagine a world on which day and night last
fourteen days each when the atmosphere of the
moon became thinner and less cloudy these nights
necessarily became so cold that during their two
weeks duration everything began to freeze al-
ready by that time the lunarians must have invent-
ed means to protect themselves against the cold
and i hope to find traces of these measures in exis-
tence today

  we know also that ages ago such catastrophes
as we are now experiencing such glacial periods
occurred robbing both earth and moon of their
share of solar heat as yet the earth was unin-
habited but the moon must have been at the peak
of her existence and no doubt a highly-developed
race had invented protective devices and measures
from which we could learn enough to guide our
course i wish to discover these experiences of a
long-extinct race in another world

  that is my plan

  baumgart sat down crossed his legs folded his
papers and wiped his high forehead with a silk
handkerchief

  the audience had followed him with the closest
attention as he closed impressions and opinions
were whispered from neighbor to neighbor the
exposition had been decidedly clear and convincing
and he might easily be right all along the line
the verdict of the experts was awaited with some
eagerness

  old rawlinson the astronomer was the first to
ask for the floor his patriarchal beard trembled
slightly as he began

  ladies and gentlemen the general features of
the picture of the evolution of a heavenly body as
presented by my german colleague were correct
but i wish to say that in my judgment the moon
has never been inhabited since the shortening of
the lunarian day so correctly described by the
speaker took place at a time when the moon was
still a glowing sphere of liquid higher forms of
life could never have evolved there though very
primitive plants and animals may have developed
one proof of this is the fact that even our best

telescopes fail to detect any trace of human acti-
vity of ancient structures or the like though we
would be able to recognize an object of the order
of the pyramids of gizeh or even our own parlia-
ment building in short i do not believe that the
moon has ever been inhabited and this undermines
the entire proposal

  dr abdul ben-haffa director of the cairo ob-
servatory a man with a dark olive face clean-
shaven head and roman nose rose with the easy
manner of the oriental stroked his ebony black
beard and said i regret the necessity of being
forced to contradict my honorable colleague from
the cape i am in perfect concurrence with the
ideas of the foreign scientist except for details of
minor importance i am of the opinion that the
moon was at one time inhabited i even believe that
i have discovered in collaboration with my assist-
ant voorthuizen distinct traces of the activities of
a highly-developed race in our neighboring world

  our new telescope will decide this question one
way or another within a few weeks we have no
proofs whatsoever that the duration of the moons
day was altered so early in planetary history as mr
rawlinson assumes we have proofs neither for
nor against the previous habitability of the moon
at all events it would be taking a highly medieval
viewpoint to believe that the earth was the sole
planet to bear intelligent life it is a drop of waer
in the universe one of many millions

  dr rawlinson claims our telescopes can now
detect objects of the size of this parliament build-
ing this is correct but who is to say whether the
lunarians were of the same size as ourselves
whether they ever built such gigantic structures or
when they built them for countless millennia
they have been extinct and their structures would
long since have become collapsed masses of rubble
only certain outlines certain geometrical contours
could remain to show us today that there were on
the moon cities buildings roads and viaducts and
such outlines i believe i have seen but it is still
as i remarked a rather insecure hypothesis

  in short i believe firmly that we could find
such things as mr baumgart expects and i remain
in doubt only as to how he will reach the moon
since space is a vacuum and will not support an
airship it seems to me that this point must first
be clarified

  dr ben-haffa resumed his seat and johannes
baumgart rose a second time

  dr rawlinsons criticisms have been i think
answered by his colleague but i should like to
add the following remarks in all probability the
last few hundred generations of the lunarians
were forced by the cold and the shortage of air and
water to live not on the surface of the moon but in
cave-cities below the surface it is for this reason
we see very little of their later structures and the
earlier ones have long since disappeared

  now let me demonstrate how we can accom-
plish the journey to the moon in spite of the vac-
uum of space

  the man at the tribune had the audience once
more under his spell calmly in the strength of
his knowledge he demonstrated that the rocket
ships enabled humanity for the first time to leave
the planet
the cosmic cloud	

  and even if my assumptions regarding what i
expect to find on the moon should prove unfounded
humanity ought not to fail to seize the opportunity
to set foot for the first time on a land beyond the
atmosphere of the earth

  abdul ben-haffa was surprised his expressive
face showed enthusiastic approval permit me to
congratulate the speaker he said he has devel-
oped a plan that does honor to his intelligence i
am free to admit that the idea had never occurred
to me and a trial trip ought to be ventured at least
to show whether the ships have power sufficient to
carry out this great venture but this is a ques-
tion for the engineers and not for the astrono-
mers

  rawlinson seemed utterly thrown off balance by
this solution of the difficulty he stared at the
german through his horn-rimmed spectacles mut-
tering in his beard for the moment unable to make
an audible reply

  minister albarnell rose

  we have just heard mr baumgarts brilliant
exposition of his case and had the opinions of the
astronomical experts our two outstanding as-
tronomers differ so widely in their opinions that
they complement each other shall we now hear
from the engineering experts and then the opinions
of the members

  the well-known manager of the usambaranite
works took the floor in his straightforward
pleasant manner he explained that he and stander-
ton-quil co-inventers of the rocket-ship had con-
vinced themselves of the practicability of the
scheme a special vehicle would however have to
be constructed for the purpose and an extensive
trial flight beyond the earths atmosphere would
have to precede the journey itself the project
would require an expenditure of approximately
three million francs and his company would be
pleased to perform all work at cost in view of the
greatness of the enterprise if the government
consented the rocket could be built within three
months and begin its journey after another month

  standerton-quil followed him with a series of
technical details and calculations mentioning that
he would captain the space ship in person as a
proof of his belief in the practicability of the jour-
ney since he was by no means contemplating sui-
cide    the other technical experts were busily
making notes checking figures and calculating
when standerton-quil had finished his dry careful
presentation of the case jussuf drammen the fam-
ous lecturer on aerodynamics at the university of
timbuctoo requested the floor he heaved his
heavy body clumsily to his feet wiped his bald head
and in a somewhat haughty manner attempted to
demonstrate that the velocity of the rocket-ship
must be increased to three times the speed of pre-
sent rockets which would be an impossibility he
predicted that the project would end in a catastro-
phe

  at these words standerton-quil leaped from his
seat a frown of annoyance hovered above his
nose and his voice was sharp as he said

  theorists of mr jussuf drammens type have
caused endless delay and confusion in the history
of technical progress they are the fathers of
every failure may i remind the learned gentle-

man from the university of timbuctoo that he has
spoken in the most vigorous manner against the
possibility of travel even on earth with a combus-
tion rocket today one of them is racing above his
head and high commissioner chak can testify that
this vehicle which mr drammen thought impos-
sible has made the journey to the ice region of
norway and back without the slightest difficulty
mr jussuf drammen may be a giant in the field of
theory but he is hardly a practical engineer and
in spite of his enormous learning he is quite incapa-
ble of even steering a baby-carriage across the
street

chapter xvii

the great decision

the green signals at the ministers bench lit up
requesting moderation    the opinions of
the other experts were divided the trial trip
they were agreed would be the final arbiter of the
question at all events the experiment ought not
to be abandoned as it was of the highest engineer-
ing importance

  the famous director of the governmental bur-
eau of cultural research delivered a genuinely
moving speech in which he said that the german
scientist had proved by his valuable book on the
evolution of cultures that he possessed a profound
and serious mind his own department he added
had a particular interest in determining how and
whether culture had developed on other planets
and whether the same force did not cause the dev-
elopment of stars and men it might well be pos-
sible he declared that this expedition would bring
something altogether new into humanitys ken

  the conclusion of the discussion was supplied by
the short speech of the leading medical expert of
africa the grey-beard bovenhaart

  few people he said would be willing to under-
take a dangerous journey to bring advantage even
to the many in such times as these it was with-
in the bounds of possibility according to the well-
informed men they had just heard that the daring
pioneers would lose their lives in the attempt
whether these men willing to incarcerate them-
selves for days within their steel projectile depend-
ing upon an artificial air-supply exposed to the
cold of space to the unknown dangers of the moon
with its extremes of temperature and to monoton-
ous food could bear up physically under the strain
was very difficult to decide no opinion on such a
question could be delivered with certainty more
than once men had withstood more than any phy-
sician would have imagined possible entire nat-
ions had and were living on half the amount of food
physicians deemed necessary and arctic explorers
even with clothing thoroughly drenched had with-
stood a temperature of more than fifty degrees be-
low zero for extended periods miners in the deep
drifts which lead to the subterranean sources of
heat work at such enormous temperatures that it
is incomprehensible how they bear it for an hour
men are incredibly adaptable and therefore medi-
cal science was unable flatly to declare the enter-
prise impossible

  the discussion was over a lively hum of con-
	wonder stories quarterly

versation filled the auditorium here and there
the members formed little groups discussing the
different aspects of the question the problem
was unique in africas history for the first time
since man had appeared on earth a government
had before it the question whether it was advisable
to dispatch an expedition into interplanetary space
certainly a situation without precedent an eaves-
dropper among the groups of chatterers would have
noted that the majority seemed to favor the idea
the challenging boldness of the plan the hope of
new discoveries in space arrested the attention of
all

  then baumgart rose once more and the audience
became silent instantly

  i have only a few words to add to what i have
already said the national government has offered
a prize of one billion francs for a means of coping
with the difficulties brought about by the ice-age
i declare here and now that i will make no claim
on this award whatever the result of my experi-
ment i do not wish to have any shadow of mater-
ial interest obscure the great enterprise which is
dedicated to a higher aim than the acquisition of
wealth

  i ask only that the government undertake the
expense of the expedition since my personal finan-
ces do not permit me to do it i will make a will
leaving my own fortune to the dependents of those
venturing with me upon the journey whose safe
return cannot be guaranteed we may meet with
complete success and yet a tiny accident may des-
troy the expedition just as a tiny spark can shatter
a whole coal-mine    this is all i have to say
everything else is in your hands

  this little speech augmented the good impression
the german had made although the afrikanders
of the year  were distinguished by an almost
inborn sense of rectitude they were not accustomed
to sacrifice material advantages to any ethical prin-
ciples and the offer increased their respect for
the man who faced them

now mme effrem-latour rose to speak this
unique quiet humble man who knew so much
had awakened her utmost interest she felt strong-
ly attracted to a nature so utterly different from
her own and his other-worldly almost timid man-
ners which differed so widely from those of the
men of her own country her words were not
those of intellect alone her heart too seemed to
lie behind what she was saying

  when in the year  christopher columbus
who later discovered america submitted his plan
to the portuguese government a congress of scien-
tists was called to discuss the practicability of the
journey and the probability of the existence of the
countries to which he wished to travel this junta
declared the plan to be a dream the government
refused to have anything to do with it and colum-
bus carried his plan to another court where he
found more understanding

  the future showed that he was right and the
shortsightedness of the portuguese junta deprived
the country of the glory of a great discovery and
an immense material treasure do you not think
ministers and senators of this nation that our pres-
ent position is not unlike that of the portuguese in

 let us learn from history the expense
is not large all the more so since mr baumgart
refuses any reward and the construction of the
space-ship has renounced all profit on the venture

  perhaps we shall really gain enlightenment
from that quiet world whose crescent is part of our
flag but even if this is not the case we would aid the
fulfillment of one of the oldest longings of human-
ity-to explore the unknown even if this expedi-
tion never attains its goal even if it should be a
failure and the brave explorers sacrifice their lives
it would only be sharing the fate of hundreds of
expeditions of the past the path of human pro-
gress is a road lined with the skeletons of the nob-
lest of the race nobody would regret more than i
the loss of such outstanding thinkers and men of
action but this thought will not prevent me urging
you to consent to this great project africa will
be the nation to realize an ancient dream and per-
haps to initiate a new era

  the young senator took her seat in an animated
manner baumgart glanced at her she had
spoken well and her speech had pleased him pro-
foundly their eyes met in hers was the flame
of enthusiasm in his a complete gratitude then
he glanced down at his papers a trifle confused

  samuel machai and albarnell were the tellers
for the voting which resulted in a quite overwhelm-
ing majority in favor of the plan only rawlin-
son drammen one of the engineers and a few of
the older senators had cast their votes against it
samuel machai announced that the government had
committed itself to the necessary appropriation
and refused to allow the scientist to use any of his
own means for the project should the enterprise
end in a catastrophe the care of the dependents
would be the duty of the nation the details would
have to be placed in the form of an agreement and
the government reserved the right for a certain
amount of supervision it would be desirable to
have a member of the legislative body itself parti-
cipate in the expedition and he wished to have the
opinion of the technical leaders of the enterprise
on this point

  standerton-quil gave the answer to this query

  it is impossible to take with us any person who
cannot take an active part in directing the space-
ship on the other hand we will most certainly
need a man capable of substituting for me during
this long journey what is needed is some ener-
getic person possessed of technical knowledge
hard and indefatigable should such a person be
among the senators or members of parliament he
would be particularly welcome and could at the
same time act as the trustee of the government
it is understood that this would not entitle him to
interfere in the arrangements for the expedition
itself for these details i am responsible and i
cannot share this responsibility with anyone

  the double-round of sir archibald plug was in-
stantly visible making its way to the front the
old sea-dog was anxious to hoist his anchor for a
longer journey than any he had yet undertaken
his moon-like face with the halo of white bristles
rojected toward the ministerial bench the little
lue eyes sparkled with excitement and the well-
cured wine drinkers nose shone more vividly even
than usual
the cosmic cloud	

   sir archibald took his place at the top of the
tribune his lack of stature not permitting him a
range of vision across the whole audience he
waved his short arms in a gesture of defiance to the
world

  ministers and senators i have recently ex-
pressed my disapproval of such a journey to no-
where though journeys of all kinds have long been
the spice of my existence now however that the
project has been decided upon i am anxious to be
of the party and to attempt one last journey which
will certainly attain some tranquil shore whether
that of the moon or that of some still less known
and more silent world the future alone can reveal

   of all the honorable members i am probably the
one best able to meet the requirements which the
honorable standerton-quil has imposed and im-
posed with every justification a man who has
commanded ships on every ocean of the world and
fought endless battles with the forces of nature
who has been stranded and shipwrecked dealt with
pack-ice and typhoons has nothing to fear from
the dangers of this journey i have travelled in
rocket-cars at a time when no one else dared to
mount the iron horses and standerton-quil can
vouch for me if the government will honor me
with its confidence i ask permission to go make a
close inspection of the old lady up in the skies
the request was granted amid hilarious accla-
mations from the ministerial bench

   for the first time in my life i regret not being
a man sir archibald if i were i would give you a
battle for this privilege

  you see madame there is something in being
a man after all you are only a little late in real-
izing the truth i shall give your regards to the
man in the moon

  i would much rather go with you

  for heavens sake you would be in command
of the ship in no time at all and rush us all into
hades furthermore this trip is supposed to be in
the nature of a vacation for me

   youll regret it and miss me

   madame the peacock would be the loveliest of
birds if it were mute

  unfortunately i cannot return the compliment
to my outward semblance

  you are unaware of my true inner value in
that respect i am like a wine-keg

   who would dare to contradict it

samuel machai wiped a tear of amusement
from his eye and put his arm around sir arch-
ibalds shoulders with a laugh call it a day sir
archibald i should like to live until the day when
you two bury the hatchet

  thus the memorable session of the eighteenth
day of june of the year  was concluded

   long afterward the members were still standing
about in little groups hawthorn standerton-
quil mme latour sir archibald albarnell ben-
haffa and others crowded around johannes baum-
gart shaking hands with him and congratulating
him slowly the auditorium was emptied the
members poured down the wide stair past the
tumbling fountain hawthorn and standerton
walked off with sir archibald between them

   the trio resembled two obelisks on either side of

a sphere their conversation ran on the necessary
preparations johannes baumgart followed them
at a short distance walking with mme effrem-
latour and the director of the cairo observatory
at the front of the great park which exhaled a
wonderful odor of flowers they halted

  i must leave you here mr baumgart said
abdul ben-haffa extending his hand to the young
scientist once more let me offer my congratula-
tions may everything turn out as successfully as
it has begun i hope that our big new reflector
will enable us to observe you right up to the mo-
ment you reach your goal and it is not impossible
that with particularly good vision we could watch
you start on the return trip from the moon our
instrument will be theoretically capable of detect-
ing objects of twenty meters in diameter at this
distance dont fail to call me before you leave
you will find something to interest you a really
ingenious idea of my colleague voorthuizen is res-
ponsible for an instrument of which the astrono-
mers of bygone days would never have dreamed
and which only a few years ago would have been
laughed to scorn by our opticians and now i
must bid you farewell

  let me thank you once more dr ben-haffa
for the understanding and kindly way in which
you have backed my plan i shall certainly come
to see you and admire your wonderful telescope
and observe once more from a distance the world
that is my goal

  you are very welcome

  they parted

   johannes baumgart walked on by the side of his
companion down the beautiful lane of trees and
flower-beds in the widespread park a little behind
the friends who were to meet them for dinner at
the harbor hotel the world was wholly at peace
the sun a little dimmed still made the air de-
pressingly close and the low-hanging branches
were starred with fine drops

   an almost overpowering odor distilled from the
flowers numbing the senses the combination of
heat airlessness and the heavy odor of the flowers
gave the german who was unaccustomed to such
a climate a feeling of heaviness his beautiful
companion said nothing and he was conscious of
her femininity like an aura amidst this profusion
of odors as the slow rustle of her dress forced itself
upon his consciousness in a singular swishing
rhythm he removed his hat and wiped his fore-
head

   a tiny snail trailed slowly across the path he
just missed stepping on it he bent carefully
picked up the little animal and placed it carefully
on the lawn at the left of the path

   khadija watched the little incident with interest
it opened for her a whole vista into the nature of
this man her head swirled with thoughts she
had not failed to note that two or three times he
had made as though to thank her for her support
at the session but each time had walked on more
rapidly with a certain boyish timidity as though
to catch up with their friends ahead as soon as
possible so clear were his thoughts to her that
she felt she could read his heart like a book she
sensed the purity and almost childish confusion of
his mind the more since she had never before
	wonder stories quarterly

encountered anything of the kind

  finally it was she who broke the silence

  i expect that you will be frightfully busy now
mr baumgart

  he emerged from his meditations with a start
yes yes and i am glad of it a heavy load has
been taken off my mind the end is in sight

  a moment more and he seized her hands spon-
taneously he was almost stuttering as he thank-
ed her for her vigorous support in the senate
meeting

  khadija stopped she returned the handclasp
of the learned child who stood before her gently
then looked down as though in thought

  yet i have my doubts whether i really spoke
for your best interests the day may come when
i will regret it

  he looked inquiringly into her face failing to
understand the sense of her words

  your glance seems to ask a question i made
myself more than a little obscure    perhaps i
will explain some other time shall i see you again
before you leave to bid you farewell before your
trip into the unknown  you intend to go to
cairo do you not in less than half an hour the
electric railroad will take you to my home from
there its outside the city in the grove of zadphe
in a quiet little nook of its own there i live all
year round and raise flowers in our old garden
you will find a different kind of a khadija not the
senator    will you come

  johannes baumgart looked at the ground then
said in a low voice ill be there

  khadija effrem-latour took the germans hand
and squeezed it slightly

  ill be waiting for you

  hello there a booming voice called from the
end of the green arcade it was standerton-quil
we thought you had lost your way

  the two walked on more quickly at the curve
of the path the glittering ocean was visible and the
big hotel on the pier reflected every light from its
long ranks of windows they had reached their
destination

  sir archibald plug today more proud of himself
than ever before could not recall having seen the
beautiful khadija so silent and serious in the long
course of their association all his little darts fell
lamely to earth unreflected from his antagonists
shield of ironic humor grumblingly the old sailor
plunged into the wine

  the devil knows how long ill be able to drink
like this he said

chapter xviii

work begins

now a period of feverish activity began for the
usambaranite works at the cape for a
fortnight standerton-quil was completely invisible
leaving his office only for meals or for an evening
walk under the silvery trees pipe in mouth and
desirous of silence he held long conferences with
his colleagues on technical questions for instance
the plans of the windows of the space ship alone
had to be changed five different times bince a mul-
titude of problems possibilities and dangers were
involved

  the slightest carelessness would bring ruin to the

whole conception in an electric locomotive a ship
or an airplane a mistake on the part of the con-
structor could be rectified a few kilometers from
the start the vehicle could be turned around the
whole worlds workshops were at hand in an emer-
gency but this machine once set loose in space
would either reach its destination or be shattered
somewhere in infinity

  in the consideration of each special problem the
engineer sought johannes baumgarts opinion he
considered the parts of the strange bird that was
to carry them to the moon from the astronomical
point of view submitting his judgment on condi-
tions in space the effect of temperature the sub-
stance of the nebula the varying forces of gravita-
tion of earth and moon the solar radiation and the
difficulties to be expected in landing on the moon
in coping with these problems however stander-
ton-quil could allow no judgment to overrule his
own since the scientist was so unpractical that the
engineer once remarked humorously that he und-
erstood the structure of millions of suns in the
milky way but was incapable of driving a nail into
a wall

  the body of the star of africa which was to be
the name of the space-ship would have a length
of fourteen meters and a diameter of two and a
half meters at its central sections standerton-
quil had departed from the pure shell shape and
chosen a cigar-like form the stern of the space
ship tapered down though it did not come to a
sharp point like the bow the entire body was to
be cast in a single piece for which purpose com-
plicated preparations and alterations in the casting
department of the factory were necessary

  hawthorn himself was ceaselessly at work shift-
ing his best workmen to the points where they were
most needed and seemed to understand just how to
inspire them to the limit of effort they went at
the job with a complete understanding of all its
implications an army of newspapermen and
photographers swarmed round the usambaranite
works the african herald had engaged the ser-
vices of an engineer whose sole duty was to submit
technical reports on the progress of the construc-
tion the strange project drew the attention of
newspapers from every continent of the globe the
pens of the best known experts labored unceasing-
ly and opinions ranging all the way from enthus-
iastic approval to predictions of disaster engaged
the attention of five continents every schoolboy
in both hemispheres became familiar with the por-
trait of the strange german and every newspaper
was filled with the likeness of standertons power-
ful head the indispensible pipe projecting from his
mouth like an elephants trunk

  long before the mold was complete fantastic pic-
tures of the space ship were in print and a south
american paper even ran a report of the crash of
the star of africa before the molds had been tapped
to be filled with the molten steel

  the moon had become the most popular of the
heavenly bodies throwing even the veiled sun and
the svendenham nebula into the shade in every
paper her pallid craters her melancholy dark
heights were pictured the past of the moon and
the question of its former habitation were treated
with more or less technical information and a great
the cosmic cloud	

opera house in johannesberg made a sensation with
a tone-poem entitled a journey to the moon

  a number of requests to be taken on the journey
came in a wealthy australian sheep-rancher of-
fered to undertake the entire expense of the enter-
prise were he permitted to join an occult society
in burma published a pamphlet announcing that
the moon was the residence of former inhabitants
of the earth who had become burdened with sin
during their lives and warned the explorers against
an overbold journey into this land of tortured souls

  nor was there any lack of serious advice from
astronomers and engineers each of the missives
containing such theories was carefully considered
some of them even inducing standerton-quil to
alter this or that part of his design the consid-
erations advanced by a japanese meteorologist
were of particular value he called attention to the
fact that the chief dangers menacing the space ship
was that of collision with meteorites large or small
approximately ten million diminitive meteorites
enter the atmosphere in the course of a day and
millions of larger ones are constantly racing
through space

  the majority of the fragments are scarcely as
big as a pea but pieces of the size of a fist and from
there right up to the size of a barrel are present
also and their velocity is enormous-a thousand
times that of a fast train clearly such a stone
would go right through the steel walls of the rocket
as a bullet would through a box    johannes
baumgart had not omitted to consider this danger
having listed it as the chief difficulty menacing a
flight through space but had remarked that the
space ship was powerless against it very few
such splinters reached a size as to offer serious
danger to the rocket however

  the carefully garnered statistics of the japanese
induced standerton-quil to plate the inner shell of
the vehicle with another thin layer of armor to fac-
ilitate the detection of the points of ingress of any
such celestial bullets a supply of lead wedges
was also provided to stop up such holes when they
occurred

thus were the thousand details cared for one
by one but the chief difficulty lay in the nec-
essity for the faultless construction of the combus-
tion chambers they were manufactured of pure
platinum and cost far over a million francs
through a clever radiator arrangement the heat
was led off from these combustion chambers and
through the other rooms of the rocket where the
cold of space would otherwise attack the occupants
a system of cooling pipes was also arranged around
the explosion chambers to permit the cold of space
to have access to them

  the fourteen-meter body of the star of africa
was divided into five rooms of varying size connect-
ed with each other through small manholes each
inch was utilized to the highest degree in the
first compartment was the control chamber with
the steering gear speedometer mercury level to
indicate equilibrium the measuring instruments
for temperature in the combustion chamber and
similar devices from this compartment one en-
tered a small chamber which contained the provi-
sions for the travellers furs utensils of every sort

and steel tanks to hold the compressed air supply

  adjoining this store room was the main room of
the space-ship arranged as living quarters and
bedroom for the members of the expedition who
were off duty its interior arrangements were the
cause of much cogitation as it had to be arranged
with a view to the different positions with regard
to gravity that the rocket might assume a large
table deep chairs built-in beds closets for maps
and books and minor necessities for the journey
were arranged in this compartment

  behind the salon as standerton termed it there
was another small chamber next to the engine-
room here in zinc boxes were stored the charges
of usambaranite all ready for insertion into the
automatic combustion machinery which delivered
them to the ignition chambers by a clockwork de-
vice here also were stored duplicate parts of
every description tools and a few tanks filled with
liquid helium to be used in an emergency  at
the very tail was the engine-room here behind
the automatic machinery glittered the wide platin-
um covers of the combustion chambers and here
the web of heat-conducting pipes wound in and out
while on the walls was the signalling apparatus
from the control-chamber

  from the outside five exhaust pipes were visible
glittering in the sun like silver trumpets

  circular windows constructed of four-inch thick
unbreakable glass reinforced with steel mesh per-
mitted vision in all directions in the salon they
were so large that even sir archibald could easily
have crawled through the port-holes they were
held in place by powerful screws which drove them
against rubber rings and served for doors as well
as windows between the outer armor and the
inner plating of steel standerton installed a three-
inch coating of pure wool

  all the rooms could be illuminated not brightly
but sufficiently by means of storage batteries in-
stalled in the base of the vehicle there remains
to mention that a chemical oven in which heat suffi-
cient for ordinary cooking purposes was produced
by simple chemical processes

  most of this was still in blue-print form or pass-
ing through the necessary tests in the various
building plants and required much alteration and
improvement

  standerton-quil raced about with a comet-like
tail of hawthorns engineers he was in his ele-
ment delighted with everything i shall not
commence this journey before i am convinced that
the last screw and the simplest closet-door fulfills
its requirements to the very limit the moon has
waited a thousand million years for our visit and
she wont mind a few weeks more or less now i
am thoroughly decided that the whole ship will be
broken up unless it is perfectly efficient

  years ago i saw in the museum of timbuctoo
the dried mummy of an engineer who tried with
insufficient means to reach and explore the bottom
of the ocean in a steel ball he remained right
there and through some freak the device came to
the surface after centuries  i cant help think-
ing of this mummy all the time im making pre-
parations and i have no particular desire to be
stared at after eight hundred years all shrunk up
like a raisin
	wonder stories quarterly

  thats right said kowenkott the devil
knows where the star of africa will wind up if we
dont have perfect control		

  meanwhile hawthorn was engaged in extensive 
conferences with the officers of the deep sea diving
corporation whose artificial respiration devices
were world-famous they had regarded it as a
duty to invent something pecularily practical and
reliable for the interplanetary venture the stand-
ard apparatus being too uncomfortable for con-
tinuous use during the stay on the moon

  long experiments resulted in a solution that was
finally held satisfactory the inventor of the suit
putting it to the test by a five-day stay in an eva-
cuated chamber he emerged as hale and hearty
as he had entered the necessity of eating and
drinking in comfort with the mask on was of
course the foremost consideration and an air-pack
that would not unduly hinder the movements of
the wearer or disturb his sleep ranked next in the
new suit respiration proved easy the supply of air
clear and regular and odor and taste were elim-
inated baumgart who tried the breathing mask
for a day was forced to admit that the air fur-
nished by the pack was purer and fresher than that
in the neighborhood of factory-ridden cape town

thus everything that had been only paper plans
desires and intentions slowly acquired the cold
reality of fact the day for the trial flight was not
far distant standerton-quil had asked sir arch-
ibald plug to abandon his favorite nook at the navy
club long enough to come to cape town crawl into
the iron prison and re-learn the art of navigation
in the new rocket sir archibald turned up punc-
tually not without a goodly stock of his beloved
tripolitan wine

  meanwhile kowenkott had been training baum-
gart and the reliable young mechanic samha in
operating the combustion apparatus sir archi-
bald arrived just at the right moment to partake in
this course of instruction it being imperative that
every member of the party be able to replace every
other the intention was to make several flights
with an ordinary terrestrial rocket-ship with first
one and then another of the proposed crew as cap-
tain mechanic before the great trial journey was
attempted

  the star of africa was by now half-finished
wings were being installed part of the interior
equipment had been built and the provisions in air-
tight boxes had arrived from the best-known afri-
can food-preserving establishments the deep sea
diving corporation had promised the shipment of
the apparatus it was furnishing for the following
week and telephone apparatus for communication
within the ship the great day grew near

  johannes baumgart was an infrequent visitor in
the huge assembly department of the usambaranite
works he was still living at hawthorns house
and preferred to sit in his room perusing works on
the moon huge photographic maps of the surface
of the star of night filled the room showing every
mountain-peak and every crater be it only a hun-
dred meters in diameter ben-haffa had sent on
from cairo detailed diagrams of those sections of
the moon which in his opinion showed traces of
former habitation and where the german stood

the best chance of finding what he hoped piles of
calculations and diagrams rose round baumgart
like a sea

  the weather remained continuously unfavorable
the sun being surrounded by a reddish-brown veil
during the rare hours of good vision

  disquieting news on came from europe to hurry
the workers in north america food riots were
breaking out causing much damage australia
too seemed to be in a state of flux more than five
hundred thousand people the advance guard of the
european immigrants had already reached africa
south america had sent a great fleet of liners to the
ports of the canadian republic to carry away the
dissatisfied masses the general impression was
that of a world-situation beyond endurance and
immediate relief

  the chinese and indian governments working
with remarkable speed had already evacuated the
most seriously affected parts of their countries
the newspapers were filled with stories of the
grave dangers caused by enormous masses of ice in
the northern and southern seas even the most
hedonistic began to feel the significance of an ice-
age in these times of highly developed culture and
overpopulation of large areas of the earth

  these facts were not lost upon the man who sat
in his quiet room studying the maps and photo-
graphs of an extinct world presently he was fold-
ing up the enormous moon-map of the melbourne
observatory a work on which three generations of
astronomers had cooperated

  what had become of europe the mother of cul-
ture which had infused all other continents with
its spirit sent its pioneers into ther lands and
through its scientific and technical achievements
had made possible the unlocking of all natures sec-
rets

  its peoples were emigrating it was like the
foretaste of the death of an entire world of
course the cloud itself would not last forever but
by a natural process the world itself would slowly
reach the point where it would become as cold and
dead a planet as the moon

  in the moon also summer and winter once upon
a time decked the satellite in changing seasons
there was blossoming and ripening birds sang in
groves eyes gazed upon the stars or wondered at
the huge disc of the earth perhaps high cultures
had risen there and a race that sought the true
the beautiful and the good but all that was now
vanished

  between the drop of water on which one ob-
serves by the microscope a thousand tiny organ-
isms and which slowly dessicates until only a little
speck of dust remains-between this drop of water
and the slowly drying globe there was really no
difference but that of size and length of life

  baumgart stepped to the window and gazed out
into the grey evening heavy clouds raced across
the sky what was the purpose of it all he won-
dered after all what was all the battling for if
the destruction of all cultures and the stranding
and sinking the withering and extinction the death
of the world lay at the end of the trail  must not
this planet appear as hopelessly tiny and ephemeral
to some almighty eye as the aimlessly-moving
mites in the drop of water this one drop dries
the cosmic cloud	

out its inhabitants are destroyed but the ocean
contains billions more such drops and the al-
mighty eye turns away from the insignificant earth
or moon or whatever it was called leaving it a
dead wreck-and focusses itself on one of the mil-
lions of other stars in the universe watching the
beginning of some new creation

  the young scientist pressed his forehead against
the glass gazing at the milling clouds he mur-
mured the words of goethe eternity it eternally
reproduces itself for every thing must dip in noth-
ingness if it would retain a trace of being

  a hand fell lightly on his shoulder rousing
from his reverie he turned around miss haw-
thorn 

  if you arent in a brown study the end of
the world might come and youd never notice it
i knocked at the door twice and you never heard
me it was so quiet in here that i thought you had
gone out i have come to tell you that we must
dine all alone again my father and standerton-
quil went to pretoria to take over the windows of
your-prison i hardly ever get a chance to see
father any more hes so busy seeing that this
drama is staged properly

  youre holding me responsible for bringing this
restlessness into your peaceful home never mind
it will all be over soon

   will it really all be over

  sooner than you think in ten days then all
your cares will fly away with us

   elizabeth stood beside him following his gaze out
into the darkening night through which fell a mel-
ancholy rain she sighed and said almost inaudi-
bly and with an air of resignation

  the cares will only begin then and im afraid
that at that moment a pall not less grey than those
out there will lay itself about this house a pall
which will never be lifted-never

baumgart turned full around for some time
he had been moved by the pessimism which had
engulfed his hostess it seemed to him that she
suffered more than the others knew the thing
had to be dealt with and it seemed to him that
this was the time

  miss elizabeth lets forget for a moment that
politeness should compel me to leave your inner-
most personality out of my criticism who has
more right than you to ask me not to dissect their
thoughts with scientific calm you are suffering
as a result of our venture you alone of all the
millions who look forward to it face it almost as
an enemy and you alone of all the countless people
of the world would be willing to destroy the enter-
prise if it lay in your power

  i understand thoroughly that you take some
personal interest in us who have had the privilege
of being near you so long and that you are fearful
whether the men who have been guests under your
roof would return from this adventurous journey
in safety but your father our friends are they
not also aware of the doubts and difficulties of so
bold a plan yet our friends are doing all they
can to forward the task

  they know very well that we are embarking
upon uncertainty but they lay all these little per-
sonal emotions to rest in view of the greatness of

the work and the importance it may acquire for
the whole world you alone are sunk in complete
pessimism and completely withold your approval
didnt standerton-quil say recently that you hated
the steel bird he had built with so much pains and
that he would not be at all surprised if you des-
troyed it with explosives some dark night as
the daughter of the king of ghostland in the opera
we recently heard destroyed the ship of the man
from the distant country your father heard the
remark he gave me a queer look and walked off
with a shrug of his shoulders you alone are op-
posed to the plan which to a certain extent repre-
sents the crowning of my lifes work and you do not
share the joy i feel over being near the goal and
having surmounted so many handicaps    and
why

  elizabeth hawthorn continued to look out into
the distance the room had become so dark around
them that the white statue of goethe placed there
by his admirer could be seen only as an indistinct
blot she remained silent for some moments and
when she spoke it was almost in a whisper

  perhaps because i am a woman perhaps be-
cause i dont think with a technical brain and fail
to grow enthusiastic over the greatest engineering
work of the year  perhaps because i am the
only one of all the millions who does not perceive
with the mind but feels with the heart that valua-
ble men are going straight to destruction before
the eyes of a world which desires nothing but a
spectacle

  and that you of all people you the man of the
deepest perceptions the man to whom the purely
spiritual things-poem an ethical or philosophical
problem-means so much more than all technical
knowledge all this superficial junk cannot even
make one heart happy    that of all people you
should involve yourself in such a world-spectacle
that you should lose yourself in a gigantic mach-
ine-that hurts me    but then of course i am
only a woman

  elizabeth had become more and more excited as
she proceeded giving vent to the thought she had
carried unexpressed for weeks and yet her feel-
ings ran deeper than anything she said now she
stepped back into the dark of the room turning to
go baumgart surprised at this outburst never-
theless found much in it that struck an answering
chord

  remain yet a little while elizabeth i under-
stand your feelings and i esteem them far more
than the applause of the masses who look only upon
the surface but you must realize that behind the
things you condemn so superficial and technical lies
a great ethical idea this machine and this jour-
ney are only instruments for reaching springs that
run deep and clear and which i hope will benefit
humanity you have heard the latest reports of
the food-riots of the misery of the thousand and
one troubles that threaten to lower our civilization
to the ancient status of tooth and claw

  it cannot be incomprehensible to you that it is
this side of the question that furnishes the incen-
tive for the enterprise-at least for me  you
say in a kind of self-deception that you are only a
woman to whom the masculine urge to dare is for-
eign who takes things sentimentally but have not
	wonder stories quarterly

women also been enthusiastic have not women of
intellect offered cooperation even participation in
the journey has not so important a woman as
mme effrem-latour used all her influence to furth-
er my plans 

elizabeth hawthorn suddenly crossed the
room to the man at the window visible now
only as a silhouette in the gloom she stood before
him for a moment looking at him silently and
suddenly took both his hands hurriedly forget-
ting everything else she ejaculated

  you foolish man i you great thinker and sage
how little you know a womans heart there is
no one in this country to whom i could aay what i
say to you who are a giant in knowledge and a
helpless child in the ordinary questions of existence
try to understand that a woman works on another
basis than logic that a strong feeling for a man
who is involved in a thing can force her to take
sides without any reasonable basis   

  im no person to analyze mme khadijas feel-
ings but one thing i know since her visit and from
what i have heard about the meeting in zanzibar-
and that is that she takes a strong personal interest
in man how much do you know of what a woman
can learn from a glance or a word are you sure
that the beautiful khadija does not already regret
having promoted the dangerous plan do you
know whether she is not already fighting an inter-
ior battle in which her feelings for the man and
the ambition to see him as the columbus of the
interplanetary spaces are the antagonists it
would be far more like her than me to act like the
daughter of the king of ghostland and destroy the
ship which is to carry away the stranger to whom
she has given her heart and which might ship-
wreck him on shores from which no love can ever
rescue him

  i have not succeeded in keeping you from the
work with which you will perish dont deny it
there is a certain intuition in the heart of a wo-
man of which your keen mind is not aware when
those terrible port-holes have once closed behind
you when the prison of steel has once admitted you
and when your face has disappeared behind the
ugly breathing mask i am sure i will have seen
you for the last time this alone justifies me in
forgetting the unwritten law and telling you that
i know a man in whose hands i would be willing
to place my heart for the rest of my life and that
this man wishes to fare forth into the horrible
distance to his death

  she let his hands drop flung herself into a chair
and lay there weeping her blonde head pillowed on
the great maps of the extinct world which seemed
to be claiming a new sacrifice and claiming it from
her

  johannes baumgart profoundly moved stared
at her in bewilderment a tumult of emotions ran
through his mind of women and womens hearts
he knew but little his studies had left him little
time to learn and a hermit-like mentality had given
him a somewhat unworldly attitude but of one
thing he was strongly aware that this blonde
daughter of the old engineer who had so much
german blood in her veins was offering him a great
and pure love

  he vanquished his shyness tiptoed to her side
and stroked her blonde head tenderly

  i thank you elizabeth for your love and your
confidence if i were my own master and not the
servant of this enterprise and through it of all hu-
manity i could say something other than what the
dictates of duty compel me to say now i ask you
for but one favor give me your confidence as well
as your heart have courage and hope for our
safe return

  if and when the star of africa which now
causes you so much anxiety glides down from the
clouds to the good green earth again the day will
have arrived when i have the right to be more
than just a friend to you and i do believe in the
coming of this day

  johannes baumgart took elizabeths little hand
and squeezed it gently he lifted her from the
chair and tightly wrapped in each others arms
they left the darkened room

            chapter xix
            last moments

i i p entlemen said sir archibald plug ill

  ijtagree with you on anything else in the world
but dont tell me that a little nip on such a jour-
ney would do any real harm a ship is a ship
whether it floats in the water or the air and the
man who runs a ship must keep his gizzards warm
from time to time believe me i know it from
experience

  the rotund little man held a bottle of wine in
each arm defending them against standerton and
baumgart with more vigor than success neither
of them would hear of dutch courage on such a
trip

  all right all right sir archibald well let you
get away with it on the trial trip but on the jour-
ney all you will get is a few small doses as medi-
cine dont you think it will be just as hard for
me giving up my pipe all the same well have
to do it

  my dear standerton for the two-thousandth
time i advise you to give up the nasty habit of
smoking and take snuff

  ill try it some time

  let us go in now gentlemen kowenkott and
samha are already in the engine room the longer
we wait the bigger the crowd will be there is a
frightful mob around already

  the date of the trial trip had been kept as close
a secret as possible graachten in particular had
been requested not to print the date or hour in his
journal although he and his staff had been noti-
fied and artists photographers and reporters had
turned out in force and had been given box-seats
for the show graachten was chatting with haw-
thorn his paper had contracted for the first wire-
less dispatched from the star of africa when it
reached the outside of the atmosphere and he had
also been promised the first pictures of the earth
taken from the highest altitude man had ever at-
tained

  the space ship lay on a long ramp reflecting the
rays of the sun which for a few days had won a
victory over the enshrouding clouds workmen
the cosmic cloud	

from the usambaranite plant were busy elevating
the prow of the star of africa and removing the
chocks

  the hour was a little after six a m the time
chosen as the one at which they were least likely
to be disturbed scarcely a hundred people had
been invited but the news that the moon-flyer
was to make its trial trip had spread by a kind of
grapevine telegraph and there was already a great
concourse of people gathered on the surrounding
hills and along the roads that lead to wellington
stellenbosch and mowbray on the beach between
old fort and craig tower beyond the railroad a
dark mass of people moved uneasily and an in-
creasing stream of spectators was pouring out of
cape town itself the crowd had nevertheless
enough self-discipline to respect the limits of the
flying field the most desirable locations for see-
ing the flight were close to the rocket especially
near its exhaust pipes and were obviously unsafe

  baumgart stepped over to where hawthorn and
elizabeth stood in the midst of a little group of the
invited guests

  is everything ready at sea asked coliman the
member of parliament from the cape district who
leaning on his cane was contemplating the last pre-
parations with a somewhat worried air

  everything mr coliman the port authorities
have notified us that electric speedboats as well as
high-speed crane ships have announced their ar-
rival at their posts by wireless the most south-
erly post is near kerguelen land there are land
observation posts also at cape guardafui in the
arabian sea on the west coast of the malay pen-
insula at ceylon on the bay of bengal in suma-
tra and finally along the west and south coasts of
australia

  however we wont bother them the flight will
not be dangerous at all of course we will keep
over the indian ocean to remain in view of the
observers not that it will do much good in a few
minutes we will be beyond the range of everything
but the most powerful of telescopes

  do you really think that all dangers are elimin-
ated at least for this trial trip

  absolutely you see there is nothing parti-
cularly difficult about it we will go through the
atmosphere just as other rocket vehicles do the
atmosphere continually growing thinner extends
upward to  kilometers from the surface this
is proved by the presence of small meteorites be-
coming incandescent at this height due to the air
resistance but of course there is no such thing
as a definite line marking the limit of the air our
atmosphere fades into empty space occupied only
by the svendenham nebula very slowly almost
unnoticeably at twelve kilometers above the
earth float the last cold clouds

  if the ships velocity is sufficient to take it be-
yond the rarefied areas we will imply fly out into
space to about three thousand kilometers from the
surface and then return for the rest of the way
to the moon we will meet conditions no different
from those that exist a thousand kilometers beyond
the surface of our planet

  how much time are you allowing for your
flight asked benjamin graachten

  the velocity of the space-ship will average 

kilometers an hour in a few seconds we will be
through the cloud-layers and a few minutes more
will take us out of the atmosphere in twenty
minutes we will be a thousand kilometers from the
earth and well into the substance of the svenden-
ham nebula from that distance we will try
dropping a couple of message bombs

lets hope they will be found said graachten

how are you going to drop them  its the first
time  have heard of such a thing said coliman

uta e didnt think of the idea until last week
vv and standerton-quil just had time to make
the alterations necessary they are light hollow
steel cylinders in which the messages are placed
after being engraved on thin platinum with a steel
stylus at one end of the cylinder a propeller is
attached so that their flight will be slowed down
on entering the atmosphere the propellers mo-
tion ignites a charge of magnesium powder that
burns for a long time we hope the cylinder will
not escape the attention of the observation posts
they are light enough to float on the water and will
be found even if they drop in the middle of an
ocean

  and you intend to drop such cylinders during
your journey to the moon

  exactly standerton has constructed a dis-
charge-chute for them in the hull of the rocket-ship
on the principle of an air-lock we place the cylin-
der in the chamber close the inner lock and open
the outer with a lever the cylinder drops is at-
tracted by the earth gravitational field flies to-
ward it finally penetrates the atmosphere where
the air resistance sets the propeller in motion the
charge ignites and the cylinder slowly descends
of course we will be able to send such messages
only while the earths gravity is dominant be-
yond a certain distance the moon will have a great-
er attraction and would get any message-cylinders
we dropped

  arent you afraid asked elizabeth who had
heretofore been standing silently beside baumgart
regarding them with a look of grief and resigna-
tion arent you afraid that these messages wnl be
missed in spite of their illumination

  no miss hawthorn the earth may not see all
of them perhaps but they will certainly get some
of them every evening at the same hour we will
drop one of these parcels-post packages since we
must keep to a definitely-outlined route to arrive
at the right spot to meet the moon after two days
these cylinders will always come from a certain
easily-predicted direction and will enter the atmos-
phere at a moment easy to calculate in advance
depending upon our distance from the earth

  the calculations on these things have been for-
warded to all observatories have been distributed
to all ships will be published in all newspapers
and called to the attention of all school children
it would be odd indeed if the messengers from
space could hide themselves from all the countless
eyes that will be watching for them some will go
astray probably so we will always dispatch the
messages in duplicate

  baumgart ceased and glanced at elizabeths
serious face he gave her hand a little unseen
squeeze she replied with a motion of her head and
	wonder stories quarterly

they stepped aside from the chattering group
hawthorns blonde daughter wished to say a few
words of farewell and her father observing them
was pleased that it should be so since the past
few weeks of strain appeared to have made inroads
on her strength out of the corner of his eye he
caught sight of elizabeth placing a rose which she
had gathered in their garden that morning in the
hand of the slender man who stood beside her

  then a group of workmen bearing a load of

within for a moment only the roundest round of
the round old captain was visible giving a touch of
comic relief to the general air of strained expecta-
tion everyone felt that the plug was justifying
its name he looked like nothing so much as a stop-
per from the round window of the rocket

  he finally got through and peered back at the
crowd with his jolly red face i got in stander-
ton but whether i will get out after two days
stuffing i dont know

beams passed between them and then standertons
powerful voice shouted baumgarts name

  the engineer wormed his way through the circle
of spectators toward the star of africa his eyes
ran with satisfaction over the long body and grace-
ful wings

  sir archibald plug was just squeezing through
one of the port-holes his bottles tightly clutched in
his hand standerton-quil was pushing with en-
ergy and laughter while kowenkott pulled from

a few seconds later the three message
cylinders had dropped through
the air locks

  youll have to be put on a diet said hawthorn
shaking the old navigators hand through the ori-
fice

  baumgart had made his farewells he placed
his foot on the little steel ladder and swung himself
lightly through the opening standerton gave the
final instructions to the ground crew the last
chocks were knocked loose and then he too dived
into the spaceship
the cosmic cloud	

 a few more handshakes elizabeth stepped baumgart and plug stood by the great round

back

  within they screwed the thick portholes into
their rubber rests for a moment kowenkott was
visible at the window of the engine-room

  hawthorn was in charge of the start as far as
the ground crew was concerned the siren sound-
ed  the danger-zone was cleared

  the old man held the chronometer in one hand
it was two minutes before seven on the stroke
of seven the star of africa was to start into space

  a solemn silence fell on the assemblage every
heart beat more rapidly with the excitement of the
moment the mass of spectators was motionless
the roads to wellington and mowbray were
clogged with hundreds of vehicles of all types

ne minute to seven

  hawthorne stepped to the flagpole the
banner of the united states of africa rose to the
masthead with a rattle of blocks a murmur went
through the massed people then they fell silent
once more the moment had almost arrived

  a signal rang out from the interior of the space
ship ten seconds more hawthorn stepped be-
hind the danger-line

  elizabeth felt her knees trembling she pressed
her hand to her heart and sat down on a pile of
lumber

  two or three sharp explosions the star of af-
rica trembled slightly in its place

  another rattling salvo and the space-ship as-
cended in a drumfire of discharges

  the starting-ramp ran back in its tracks with a
shriek then tipped and would have fallen over had
the heavy oaken beams not prevented it

  a rumble of applause came from the vast crowd
the photographers worked like mad the faces of
the tens of thousands stared up to the skies making
an ocean of vague pinkish specks as the glittering
body dashed up into the blue becoming smaller
and smaller

	 

  in the living-room at the time of the start only
baumgart and sir archibald remained stander-
ton was of course in the control-chamber and
kowenkott and samha were bent over their ma-
chinery learning all its little peculiarities later
when the question of whether the medium would
support the space-ship was decided baumgart and
plug too would take turns at the controls under
standertons supervision standerton had no
doubts about the old sea-captain but thought little
of the germans technical ability the latter would
be relied upon as commander only in an extreme
emergency

the test flight

the engineer steered up and forward they
must remain over the indian ocean far be-
low them they perceived a set of dark points on the
water the ships watching the flight waiting there
to intervene should the star of africa sink to the
surface of the water a smile crossed standertons
face there was no danger nothing whatever to
fear the government was really over-anxious
however it was standing by them in good style

windows staring downward to where the earth was
becoming a mixture of colored spots in which the
green of the pastures and the darker green of for-
ests predominated

  sir archibald turned to baumgart

  within twenty minutes we will know whether
your assumptions were right or whether jussuf
drammen of the knowledge-factory in timbuctoo
will be the winner after all its really a hellish
situation you know and i frankly admit that my
heart is ticking like an alarm clock

  thats only natural my dear sir archibald
im no better off myself you can be convinced of
a theory right up to the hilt but when it comes to
the practical side one begins to doubt its more a
matter of nerves though than one of the intelli-
gence

  if only these explosions didnt make such a
racket i feel like a mouse that has crawled into
the big drum of an orchestra during the overture
baumgart nodded plug stepped over to the
opposite window he felt that the german wished
to be alone with his thoughts in the distance the
coast of africa had already become small and yel-
lowish partly veiled in the early-morning fogs that
rose from the ocean a white seam had been
drawn around it-the surf beneath them lay the
ocean a monotonous greyish-green plain a few
dabs of cotton seemed to be floating upon it in
reality they were white clouds more than five
thousand meters above sea-level a tiny black
point was visible among them a bird no-im-
possible to see sir archibald took up his glass
it was a great airplane flying landward which
had apparently come to greet the star of africa
in its own element here and there the old mariner
believed he could recognize ships-tiny points far
down but perhaps this was only an illusion of
the distance

  baumgart stepped to his side

  dont you notice anything

  nothing in particular  wait yes the in-
fernal racket of those explosions has died down
its quite a lot weaker

  correct we are nearing the limit of the at-
mosphere the sounds can no longer reach our
ears in the old strength since the air which sup-
ports them has already become very thin out
there in space we will hardly hear any noise at
all only the air on the interior of our vehicle will
carry sound

  the little red signal from standerton lit up the
two stepped to the window which gave on the con-
trol-chamber the engineer turned round pointing
to the barometer they had reached an altitude
of  kilometers the needle wavered to and fro
following the vibrations of the flying vessel at the
same time the speedometer showed that the star
of africa was now making greater speed as the air
resistance diminished

  sir archibald pointed to the needle of the wire-
less apparatus it indicated a call baumgart
stepped over to the instrument on the ribbon ap-
peared in morse code a series of words and the
needle dropped back to silent

  herald cape town have lost sight of you
request report on progress and state of travelers-
	wonder stories quarterly

  theyre a bit impatient remarked sir archi-
bald wire back that we will immediately drink
a bottle to the health of the old marabou and that
we intend to continue our journey to the moon
baumgart smiled and answered through the
wireless apparatus that fluttered behind the space-
ship like the feelers of an insect star of africa
altitude more than  kilometers so far every-
thing  k no reason for worry regards to
hawthorn

  a few minutes later the needle registered an-
other call guardship condor off mauritius
to space-ship star of africa you are still just
visible in six-foot telescope send wireless before
dropping message cylinder

  you see theyre on the job guardship con-
dor old gunzenbroich commands her known
him since he was a pup hope he doesnt have to
fish me out of this tin-can in fifteen hundred fath-
oms of water

  standerton guarantees that the star of africa
wont sink if it plunges into the ocean but it will
not even plunge

  once more the signal from the engineer lit up
and he gesticulated to baumgart to come on in
the latter crept through the connecting door in
the control-chamber the quarters were so crowded
that the second man could only stand in a bent posi-
tion beside the steering wheel

  im beginning to worry a little we are near
the limits of the atmosphere the velocity has
increased but the ship shows a tendency to flop over
when i put her at a steep angle well go on how-
ever the next ten minutes will decide the prac-
ticability of our plans

  baumgart said nothing words were superflu-
ous the facts would speak for themselves
thinking it wise to leave the engineer in peace he
went back to the living compartment

  well how does it look are we going to make
it

  the german shrugged his shoulders in a few
more minutes of patience my friend we will be
racing through the svendenham cloud or gliding
back to earth

  from this hitherto unattained altitude the earth
looked strange the impression was that of soar-
ing over a huge bowl the indian ocean had be-
come a tiny plate of muddy soup in which swam
the island of madagascar the wide shadows of
the mountains thrown by the morning sun lay
across the land in such distinctness that it would
have been easy to make a perfectly correct relief
map from them-if one only had the time on the
western horizon lay south africa a blurred yellow
mass

  the travellers stared downward each occupied
with his thoughts the tortures of anticipation
prevented any real enjoyment of the scene they
beheld all questions all discussions seemed super-
fluous standerton was motionless at the controls
ready at any moment to swing the great machine
around and dive back into the safe cushion of at-
mosphere for the first time in his life he felt his
nerves so much on edge that it took all his energy
to retain some degree of self-control neverthe-
less the conviction was gaining upon him that the

star of africa was going to ride untrammelled to
its expected height

a firm hand was placed on his shoulder baum-
 gart stood beside him pointing to the chono-
meter fifteen minutes the last traces of the
atmosphere are behind us we are already riding
in space we have won

  they were more than two hundred and fifty kilo-
meters above the surface of the planet the needle
of the barometer had long since ceased registering
the noise of the explosions had died to a fraction of
its former intensity and a singular shushing along
the windows testified to the existence of the cloud
of dust through which the star of africa was ris-
ing

  the features of the engineer brightened he
seized his learned friends hand saying thank
god we have made it

  baumgart hurried back to sir archibald

  were doing it we are in the midst of the
cloud right now and going at a fine rate at these
words plus rose and made a vigorous effort to em-
brace the german

  congratulations and compliments copernicus
and columbus redivivus wonderful magnifi-
cent  superb i wouldnt go through this quarter-
hour again for a forest full of monkeys in my
imagination i already saw this sardine-can drop-
ping back to earth and us crawling out of it like
maggots out of a tub hissed off the stage by our
adversaries listen lets celebrate-and with
what  ah ha with what  where have my bottles
of tripolitan got to

he leaped toward one of the chests in the wall
but baumgart stepped into the engine room ex-
tending both hands to kowenkott and samha we
have made it we have won our fuel is success-
ful he said

  sir archibalds little drink was received with
joy by all hands even standerton at his controls
partaking in the toast while the old captain took
the bridle of this pegasus of steel for a moment

  meanwhile baumgart was dispatching wirelsss
messages to the herald to hawthorn and to the
government in a few minutes the most remote
parts of the world had heard the news extras
were on the streets immediately the wheels of in-
dustry halted while the event was discussed and
there swept through the world long waves of that
joyful excitement everyone feels when a new and
brilliant idea becomes the property of mankind or
when some ancient dream suddenly acquires shape
and reality

  at an altitude of  kilometers baumgart sat
down at the table and engraved words of joy and
thankfulness to elizabeth on a platinum ribbon
another bore a message for the president of the
united states of africa and a third a brief report
to the african herald  a few seconds later
the three message cylinders had dropped through
the air-locks into the immense depths beneath for
a moment they shone in the sunlight like splinters
of glass at the bottom of clear water then disap-
peared in the haze

  two of these messages reached the earth one
was fished out of the ocean by the guardship con-
dor the other fell with its magnesium flare still
the cosmic cloud	

alight into the courtyard of a woolens mill at it-
rema in madagascar the third cylinder was
never recovered it was the one intended for the
herald 

  although the missives only reached their destina-
tion after two days delay a happy smile crossed
elizabeth hawthorns face as she held the thin
strip of metal in her hand this greeting from the
blue remained one of her most sacred possessions
for fifty years afterward and on her death-bed she
gripped it so tightly that it was placed in the coffin
with her

  a thousand kilometers beyond the home of hum-
anity the star of africa swung round no more
tests remained to be made for the flight to the
moon not until this moment were the inmates of
this prison of steel capable of realizing the beauty
of the spectacle the heavens presented to them
their range of vision had become enormous far
in the south the ice-barriers of the antarctic pushed
their way through the fogs with long belts of
clouds floating above them in the north the coasts
of india were visible as a dark bluish wall battle-
mented in white clouds and more clouds no long-
er recognizable as such because fused into compact
masses by the glasses of the distance towered up
like mountains under which countries lay buried

  they glided slowly back toward the earth

  it seemed as though the star of africa stood
still in space and the calico-mottled mass below rose
toward them with hurricane speed the cottony
piles of the clouds leaped toward them they dived
into the brooding sea of fog then flew along over
the ocean between two layers

  here and there were the dark spots that re-
presented ships tiny puffs of smoke escaped from
them as they saluted the detonations of the firing
being lost in the drone of the rockets explosions
then cape town swung over the horizon with its
clean-looking roofs and shining windows dark
masses of people were visible waiting their return
stippled with the tens of thousands of pink specks
that were the faces of the watchers

  the tall buildings of the usambaranite works
reached up for them and the long tracks of the
starting ramp swam into view the explosions
ceased in a chorus of hisses the shining body came
slowly down

  all round was a murmur an indistinct rustling
as though a wind-storm were tossing the branches
of a forest

  there was a sudden snap  a swaying  a
screech  the star of africa came to rest

  the screws of the windows were loosened fresh
air rushed in baumgarts face filled with the ex-
citement of accomplishment was visible a tender
white hand reached through the opening and as the
young german bent from the window two soft arms
were flung around his neck and a face was pressed
to his

  the sound of cheering grew and swelled pass-
ing across the hills where thousands of handker-
chiefs fluttered in salute

distant worlds

the sun was setting beyond the nile trailing
orange clouds of glory behind it and creating

queer pictures in the still stream up here where
the hills of the djebel mokatam swung across the
landscape cairo was visible down in the yellow
mist of the plain while curious violet shadows
waltzed in the distance a dry hot current of air
blew across the libyan desert of which in spite
of all the efforts of man only a small area had
thus far been placed under cultivation

  three gentlemen were just leaving the glittering
observatory building which shone like a castle in
spain in the setting sun placed as it was up here
on the hills far from the city they strolled
through the park toward a little glade where short
grass grew

  from here my respected colleague you can
see our giant telescope which will probably be the
largest in the world for some time to come we ex-
pect to be able to draw from the stars the last
secrets of the celestial workshops

  johannes baumgart shaded his eyes and gazed
across the green space with the best will in
the world i can see nothing mr ben-haffa un-
less you have buried your telescope in the earth i
cant imagine where to look for it

  dr ben-haffa laughed his strange oriental
laugh we did just that it is right before you
another step and you will fall into a thirty-one
meter tube and drown in the giant reflector

  he laughed again amused at his little mystery
and took baumgarts arm glad to be able to show
the famous german something new

  only at this moment did the latter realize what
he meant they stood before an immense well-
shaft at least it could in justice bear no other
name in the ground stood a circular hole a good
twenty feet wide fined with bricks and surrounded
by a low protective coping at one side lay a kind
of protective roof which had apparently been re-
moved but a short time before by the employees of
the observatory

  johannes baumgart looked into the yawing gap
before him darkness hid everything below

  a singular telescope indeed i dont quite un-
derstand the principle

  our good friend voorthuizen is the inventor
he will explain the thing to you himself
ben-haffas assistant appeared he was a tall
pale hungry-looking man with an almost terrify-
ingly ugly face only his large clever eyes were
attractive

  it would have required a really gigantic struc-
ture if i had not simply bored the instrument into
the ground we saved millions in expenses this
way you know it would be impossible to cast so
immense a reflector as this at the bottom of a metal
or glass shaft it has a diameter of  inches
how did you do it you just said that you
couldnt cast so huge a mirror what is it made of
then

  of a liquid

  i dont understand

  voorthuizen smiled flattered well its a
queer story about this invention for years i
worked on this problem in vain one evening i
was sitting over a glass of tea mulling it over in
my mind as i causally stirred the tea with my
spoon my attention was arrested by the fact that
the liquid set in rotation by the stirring was form-
	wonder stories quarterly

ing a concave mirror on its surface as everyone has
seen without noticing the fact all his life that
led me to an idea i said to myself-if one filled a
large round tub with mercury and set the tub in
rotation the surface of mercury would form such a
concave mirror as is used in telescopes i per-
formed some experiments they were successful
the chief difficulty lay in keeping the mercury-tub
at a perfectly even rotation i got in touch with
parsen  jaitchis motor factory and their engin-
eers finally succeeded in building an electro-mag-
netic gear that met all the requirements the mer-
cury-tub rotates with great regularity in a tub of
oil of slightly greater diameter

  then we went to work this deep shaft was
dug and lined the tubes were lowered to the bot-
tom electric cables installed and the giant tele-
scope was ready the tub was then filled with mer-
cury its diameter is  inches as soon as i
turn on the current up here the mercury down
there thirty-one meters below us begins to turn
and becomes a concave mirror

  here at the edge of the shaft you see the little
mirror which projects the image of the moon or
the stars formed into the mercury tub the giant
mirror reflects it hugely enlarged and i observe
the image through an eye-piece in this tittle struc-
ture here

  you see its a very simple arrangement in prin-
ciple now have the goodness to look at the won-
der-world which this instrument opens up to you

  the german entered the kiosk prisms and
lenses were adjusted and the electric current turn-
ed on the planet mars was within the range of
the mirror voorthuizen adjusted the two-thous-
andfold magnification screwed various devices
back and forth and stepped back to make room for
baumgart

  the latter seated himself in the observation seat
and gazed into the eye-piece the spectacle filled
him with the utmost admiration he had observed
the stars through the best modern telescopes hun-
dreds of times but the vision afforded by this new
instrument surpassed his expectations the ruddy
disk of the planet about whose habitability and
strange canal-like markings men had been arguing
for more than a thousand years lay before him
twice as large as the moon in the bright snow cap
surrounding the pole were wide grooves and dark-
er areas which were quite obviously ice-water
lakes but the canals were resolved into a system
of wide crevasses which cross-crossed across glac-
iated areas the pressure of the ice had created
these mighty glaciers breaking them off here and
there their shadows could be perceived as dark
lines small green areas were discernible always
in localities where they were protected by low hills
and exposed to the heat of the sun obviously poor
relics of a vegetation lichens and mosses just able
to subsist in those places where the moist volcanic
dust of the ground provided a meager amount of
nutriment a few thin cloud veils lay across
the landscape which had an appearance of utter
monotony and hopelessness

no doubt this world too was in the throes of
death was glaciating and had forgotten all
its youth its age must be between that of the

earth and that of the moon if a human race lived
there if the last generations were waiting for the
moment of their extinction who could tell

  ben-haffas voice roused baumgart from his
contemplation well what do you think of it
i am simply overcome who would have thought
that we could see a world so closely when it is re-
volving around the sun at a distance of seventy-six
million kilometers beyond the earth

  lets take a look at the moon now you will
see even greater wonders you will be able to
see it at a magnification of four thousand to one
since it is only  kilometers away from us
you will see it as though it were only about 
kilometers away in other words we will be able
to perceive objects about twenty meters long i
promised no more than i could perform when i re-
marked that we would be able to see the star of
africa as a little star near the moon when you
get there yes and when you land though we may
not see your space-ship the long shadow cast by
the sun should be visible

  darkness had descended rapidly as it always
does in these latitudes upon the crest of the hill
the white temple-like buildings of the observatory
seemed to float the crescent of the moon hung in
an indescribable silvery-green ocean of air and a
few faint little clouds of nebula-masses stood out
pinkly in the greenish-armament

  voorthuizen swung the projecting mirror round
it caught the crescent of the-moon throwing its
image down the dark shff into the rotating tub
of mercury	s

  ben-haffa adjusted prisms and eye-piece then
touched the germans shoulder lightly

  look whata wonderful sight

  johannes baumgart gazed into the eye-piece 
the other two stood silent waiting the german
did not move and the expected exclamation of sur-
prise or delight did not cofhe from his lips ben-
haffa and voorthuizenfelt that his silence was
more of a tribute than words

  theman who sat motionless gazing into the
summer night through the gigantic instrument
seemed to have difficulty in tearing his eyes from
the view it presented so near that it seemed one
could touch it the extinct world lay before his eyes
the tremendous peaks of the chain of the lunar
apennines shone like liquid silver in the light of
the sun almost as though they were crowned with
bnow like earthly mountains a tangled maze of
light and shadow lay along grim canyons and lofty
summits

  the sun had risen but a short time before on
this lunar landscape and the dawn shadows lay
long and jagged across the grey plain of the mare
imbrium

  he wondered what its appearance was in the
days when the great bowl was still an ocean filled
with tossing seas when the gigantic mountain
chain with its peaks rose fifteen thousand feet from
the bed of the ocean and when the waves racked
themselves foamily against the walls of rock did
not the bones of stranded ships lie along the feet
of these iron-bound cliffs brought to light after un-
thinkable ages by the drying-out of the ocean in
which they once sank who could tell and yet
he himself johannes baumgart would one day
the cosmic cloud	

know in a few days he would see it with his own
eyes

  baumgart slowly turned the set-screw of the ob-
ject-mirror bringing the immense round of the
circular range of eratosthenes into the range of
the instrument like a hollow molar of gigantic
dimensions the circular crater loomed before his
vision as yet the rising sun left the bottom filled
with dense shadow only the outer rim of the range
stood forth the torn walls of the great hollow
tooth descended in terraces to the plain their flanks
veiled in immense piles of rubble huge crev-
asses through which glacier-fed streams once ran
eroding the edges of the ten-thousand foot walls of
the crater presented themselves to his view

  now three stars began to twinkle in the center
of the bowl of darkness the sun had risen above
the walls and its rays were striking the tips of the
three conical mountains which occupied the center
of the crater of eratosthenes like three immense
pillars

  shadows slowly shortened across the lunar
plains light fell into the night of the deep canyons
silvery battlements lit up in the midst of myster-
ious darknesses cracks seemed to open in the solid
stone and thousands of details which no map of
the moon had ever shown became visible but no
matter how much the play of light and shadow lit
them up these lunar wonders remained utterly
lifeless and desolate it gave the sensation of look-
ing into the changeless bony visage of a skeleton
in the vault of some ancient monastery where it
was touched by a fugitive ray of the sun striking
through rotted boards

chapter xxi

a night in a garden

the german reclined closing his eyes tempor-
arily blinded by the flood of light from a dis-
tant world

  well did we promise you more than we per-
formed

  i never saw anything more wonderful it gives
one the feeling of flying over the moon the land-
scapes are distinct enough to be touched

  permit me to show you one of the localities that
looked as though it might be the remains of some
large artificial structure   just a moment a
few turns of the screw and a slight inclination of
the reflecting prism will be enough to bring the
area into the range of the instrument here
we are

  look-you are looking into the deep groove of
the mare nubium this crater here half filled
with shadows is nicollet and a few kilometers
north of it you will see a curious regular triangle
standing up out of the plain as though built of
white stone the walls are very low-scarcely
thirty meters high can you see it

   yes very distinctly

  good take a look at the corners at each
corner there are tower-like structures very regu-
lar in outline its difficult to believe that its a
natural product if one looks at the southern
wall or its shadows earefully you will note that
there are regular indentations the whole thing

gives the impression of a stone stairway and north
of it a smaller triangle lies inside the greater one
and across the whole structure there seems to be a
road lined by walls see-it terminates in an exact
rectangle as though it were the wall of a court-
yard or the foundation wall of a high building
which has disappeared right beside it you can
see another stair with two paths leading toward it
in a geometrical line connecting all the parts with
each other by the shortest and most direct route
a most singular sight it looks very much like
a planned arrangement

  and when you look at it closely everything
looks as though it were covered with a sheet of
glass the whole arrangement seems to shine
through an almost transparent refracting medium
at times the sun seems to reflect from it for a mo-
ment well i think this building or whatever it is
is covered by a thin transparent coat of ice and
that it is quite possible there is water on the moon
though only in a frozen state on account of the
cold now when the sun strikes this spot or others
like it a fine fog becomes visible as the result of
the solar heat and when the sun inks there is ap-
parently a tiny cloud hanging over the surface

  i have prepared a whole atlas of such suspicious
lunar localities for you in one of these places you
will find what you expect i think in spite of the
fact that there are so many question marks with re-
gard to the moon as yet

  baumgart rose shook hands with the two as-
tronomers 

  an unforgettable moment i thank you you
have done something great here and only now will
we really begin to become familiar with the details
of our satellite what we have seen previously
have been only the outlines

  the three men walked back up the hill path to-
ward the observatory buildings

  when will you be leaving

  in four days today standerton-quil will finish
the alterations i want to arrive on the moon dur-
ing its first quarter while the light and shadow
line crosses several of those areas you have marked
out as showing traces of human activity well
start at noon on the th of october the govern-
ment has already been notified for that date his
excellency the president and the whole ministry
will be on hand to see us off i had hoped we could
get away in the early morning without all the sen-
sation and solemnity but i fear ill have to put
up with it

  youll make the trip in three days wont you
inquired voorthuizen

  right  on the fourteenth of october we ex-
pect to arrive the moon will be in her first quar-
ter and will be near delta capricorni that star
will be the lighthouse for us to follow in order to
reach our rendezvous with the moon

  we have completed our preparations for ob
serving your flight said ben-haffa as long as
you remain outside the shadow of the earth you
will be in view your message cylinders can hard-
ly fail to be sighted provided they are thrown off
punctually their arrival can be calculated with
an error of only a few minutes

  gentlemen i must leave you i promised to
stop in to say good-bye to mme effrem-latour i


wonder stories quarterly

am almost afraid that ill be too late as it is the
night has come on quicker than i expected

  oh its by no means too late for a call accord-
ing to our ideas in these parts you must remem-
ber that up here in northern africa the early morn-
ing hours and those of the late evening are our
favorite social occasions during the noonday heat
we take a siesta and enjoy ourselves morning and

her car-and can take the express plane on the
cairo-khartoum-zanzibar line

good-bye then dr ben-haffa when we meet
again we will have a good deal to talk about

ben-haffa took the germans slender hand
and held it for a moment    the northern
scientist had won a place in his heart there was

ilumtratton by paul

looking upward we saw a dark mass of considerable dimensions
   glowing sparks and splinters

it fell dispersing

evening madame would be quite indignant if you
fail to call at her charming little house in the grove
of zadphe you can get there in a few minutes
over there where the road forks you will see a
dark hill right behind it is the grove ill have
you taken over in my car you can reach the air-
port from there-madame will doubtless lend you

much about this man with his silence and modesty
that attracted him he felt a curious surge of
emotion and he could not resist the temptation
to place both hands on the slender adventurers
shoulders and say

the roads of the world are dark my friend
you have my most sincere good wishes but you are
the cosmic cloud	

embarking on a difficult adventure worry and la-
menting should by all means be left to the women
but remember that you have in me a friend who
would lose much in you and now may the lord
of all be with you

  the astronomer released baumgart the latter
said nothing but retained the hand of the excellent
man in his grasp

  voorthuizen showed him to the exit where the
car was waiting a few minutes later the german
was travelling through the pleasant evening along
the quiet road which reflected the light of the moon
like a ribbon of chalk

  in the distance the lights of the town shone on
the horizon before him a low chain of hills stood
out of the dimness and from the roadside hedges
came the balsam-like odor of the night-blooming
plants now and then a frightened bird stirred
disappearing into the darkness of the fields

  the road wound past the quarry of turra ap-
proaching the placid waters of the nile for a few
hundred yards the ancient river along whose
banks millennia of culture had risen and passed
was a path of silver in the moonbeams  at
the hills of massarrah the car turned into a side
road in the distance the grove of zadphe was
dimly visible

  a singular sense of depression for which he was
at a loss to account laid its hand on the german
scientist was it the old nilotic scenery the moon-
light or the solitude he could not guess 

  in his breast pocket he could feel the bulk of the
lovely khadijas letter he had been flooded with
congratulations of every type after the success of
the trial trip but khadija effrem-latour had sent
only a small correspondence card in an envelope of
particularly feminine shape that when opened
gave off some odd perfume of the desert it con-
tained but a few lines

    dear friend

      do you wish me to make a parade of dead
    empty letters in black and white to tell you
    how glad i am that your expectations have
    been realized written words are dried flow-
    ers i will be at home to you as i promised
    and will expect you-nay more i will await
    you

khadija effrem-latour

  he had made the trip with some reluctance at
hawthorns they had released him unwillingly so
few days were left before the beginning of the
journey into the land of doubt and danger haw-
thorn tried to keep him back and he had seen the
disappointment in elizabeths eyes when he an-
nounced his intention of going but she had re-
mained silent realizing that these last few days
belonged to him to do with as he pleased

  he could hardly have stayed as a matter of fact
the conference with the heads of the cairo obser-
vatory loomed large in his plans and still more im-
portant was the project of observing those areas of
the moon which contained the peculiarities and
which ben-haffa had observed with the giant re-
flector   a short visit to the woman who had
taken so vivid an interest in his plans could hardly
be avoided since he was so near

  nevertheless he felt a certain excited embarass-
ment at the thought of meeting this remarkable

woman on her own ground a boyish diffidence
against which he struggled in vain overcame him
a short distance from his destination he was al-
most on the point of asking the driver to turn
round but by that time he was already slowing up
for the arrival the road forked again here into
a little driveway overarched by tall dark trees
a long white wall leaped out of the moonlight
behind it a thick grove stood blackly against the
blue of the nocturnal sky

  the car came to rest

  we have arrived sir said the driver this
is the wall of the grove of zadphe the gate is
less than a hundred paces away on the left

  baumgart thanked the man and got out of the
car the car turned and raced silently away
through the night for a while its subdued hum
was perceptible like that of a giant beetle dying
away in the distance and the german was left to
pick his way along the soft sandy path some-
where a nightingale was singing now and then
the breeze rustled eerily in the tops of the trees
and the loquacious chatter of a nearby brook was
audible

  suddenly a white figure stepped from the dark-
ness of the arcade treading inaudibly on the soft
sand

  the german stopped

  is it you

  madame effrem

  a pair of hands was extended in his direction
and a soft voice tender with delight said

  welcome thrice welcome to the grove of zad-
phe ben-haffa called me up to announce your
visit ten minutes ago i knew that you would
come and waited for you here at the gate until i
heard the hum of your car thank you for com-
ing  no lets go back to the little gate which
will let us into this cloistered home give me your
arm you will need a guide through this labyrinth
can you hear the brook be careful dont slip
theres a little foot-bridge here

the two strolled soundlessly through the dark-
ness their steps sounded hollow on the
planks of the little foot-bridge and an opening in
the white wall appeared before them khadija
stepped ahead leading her guest by one hand the
grove of zadphe admitted them to its secrets

  by their side the brook rippled and a curious per-
fume rose from the aromatic bushes the gown
of the lovely woman rustled softly not far away
the nightingale went on with its song

  still and tall the trees stood about them above
them the night sky was reduced to a slender ribbon
set with a few little stars now left and right
among the trees the indistinct forms of the an-
cient gravestones were perceptible only a few of
them remained upright the majority lay on the
ground broken and moss-grown

  what is life my friend and what is happiness
this estate was left to me by my father all about
you can see the traces of the past and through
these ancient groves whisper the memories of by-
gone love and bygone regret once upon a time
the pleasant little summer villa of the caliph selim
stood in this grove its remains can still be seen
beneath the vines here dwelt the great prince
wonder stories quarterly

and warrior and the ten favorite wives who loved
him like the flowers in their garden

   he went away to war and was slain there when
the servants brought the news despair overcame
the women of his household they killed them-
selves on the same day it sunset and the grave-
stones about us mark their resting places now
that nightingale i singing in those old trees of the
love which ended in death

   happiness madame is the foam of a wave
whoever rises with it knows that behind the crest
comes the valley it not the whole earth a single
gravestone for a hundred thousand years of his-
tory

   lets go into this little pavilion i have some re-
 freshments for you and implore you to give me the
 few hours which remain to you  my friend an
 hour which never returns is precious in this brief
 existence of ours once only does a nightingale
 sing thus on the hedge of roses can you feel the
 tranquil beauty of this moonlight  take all you
 can of it for  it will never return this moment
 behind you the world dies 

   you are melancholy and depressed mme ef-
frem

   oh never mind my friend lets not talk about
what i have experienced these last few weeks its
too late now too late thats a dreadful word
isnt it to think of having only this one little
brief life and know that beyond it comes the long
night-and to be forced to the realization that one
took the wrong turn at the crossroad and perhaps
led others in the same wrong direction

  we do what we must do nothing is accom-
plished by chance in this world and everything is
attached to invisible threads which nevertheless
cannot be broken you are worried i wish i
could help you

  you can and you cannot a great decision
would be necessary a great sacrifice    the
sacrifice of not sacrificing yourself

   i am trying though in vain to understand
what you mean

   let it be my friend dont make the effort
lets forget about tomorrow now give me your
hand so i can hold it for a moment-for the last
time

   i think we will see each other frequently in the
 future

  never again when the gate of this grove
shuts behind you i shall mourn the day

   khadija effrem-latour rose and came colse to
the man sitting before her a moonbeam fell on
her face he saw the great radiant eyes gazing
intently at him a mystic expression lay on her
pale features with deep emotion and in a voice that
rang with solemnity she said

   there are times in life when one becomes clair-
voyant and can for a moment lift the veil of the
future am i being cruel my friend if i say this
set the seal on your work listen once more to
the song of the nightingale breathe once more the
scented air of this night and drink the glass which
sparkles before your lips for the last time for be-
hind it   her white hand made a gesture of
weariness  behind it lies the long night

   the moon looked solemnly down on the ancient
graves long shadows crept across the sand of

the garden path and profound silence reigned in
the grove of zadphe

	 

   about midnight high up in the air the hum of
the great passenger plane of the cairo-khartoum-
zanzibar line was heard by those below as it
raced south one of the reserved seats was empty

chapter xxii

the last journey

it is not always possible for the chronicler to
disentangle the threads of events and make them
clear to later readers running through the book
of human history one comes on innumerable emp-
ty pages the life-threads of great and important
men are suddenly broken and the end of the story
of peoples and cultures is suddenly lost as the
steps of the desert-traveller are wiped out by the
next wind so that no other may follow the path he
took

  and do not these question marks in human his-
tory give it much of its charm centuries after
ithe event learned men dig into half-decayed records
of the past thus have they sought to bring to light
the mystery of the man in the iron mask thus es-
sayed to throw light into the darkness surrounding
the unfortunate casper hauser who came out of the
unknown and was cast back into the unknown by
a hand equally unknown

   if the events which are recorded here and if the
 waves of events they set in motion ebb silently on
 some unknown strand-who can reproach their
 recorder  what lay behind the events and person-
 alities how everything happened just so and not
 otherwise-we shall never know

  elizabeth hawthorn had exactly fifty years to
meditate on these questions she died at the age
of seventy-three an infinitely respected and bene-
volent old lady head of the southern cross hospital
of colchester which had been founded by her in
her younger days at the point where the waves of
the indian and atlantic oceans met at the tip of
the continent

   fifty years she had to think about the day when
she saw the young german scientist for the last
time and the mystery remained insoluble she
saw the coffin close over the living saw the man to
whom she had given her hearts best suddenly tear
the bond which bound them together and disappear
into space if the great world talked for decades
about the fate of this expedition if hundreds of
scientific treatises considered the problem from
every angle and poets made of it a subject for their
jnost impassioned verse-for her there remained
another mystery greater even than that which
exercised the astronomers

   she brooded over it for fifty years it still es-
 caped her in later years this or that vague idea
 occupied her mind certainty she never reached
 until the end of her days she remained faithful to
 the man whose strange plan had brought him into
 her life and whose unique fate removed him from
 it when at a great age she lay down for her
 last rest she gripped the tiny ribbon of metal
 which once long in the past had been engraved
 with a greeting by that hand she had hoped to hold
the cosmic cloud	

 for the rest of her life her fingers refused to re-
 lease it and she took it with her to the grave

  her father had long since joined the great maj-
ority he never really recovered from the tragic
conclusion of the great enterprise his interest in
his work died in that hour and he seized with some-
thing like delight the first opportunity to retire
he faded slowly like a candle and on his death his
daughter used the great fortune that stood in her
name to found the hospital at colchester where she
spent the rest of her days   

   the blow affected her differently than her father
his mind was tortured by the question of what cir-
cumstances had led to the catastrophe about what
grim end had come to his friends not so eliza-
beth it was not the end of the enterprise that
perplexed her from the first day she had expected
it and the return of her beloved would have been
a gift from the gods to her but her beloved had
suddenly changed and when the last locks of his
coffin had closed the living dead man had made a
farewell sign that somehow spilled the cup of their
happiness in each other

  why    why    this was the question
with which elizabeth tortured herself till the days
when her hair grew white

let us contribute what we can to the solution
of the mystery every voice speaks its
thoughts and theories impressions and opinions
but all roads empty into impenetrable dark where
each must furnish his own torch in elizabeth
hawthorns diary the following entries are to be
found

                                october  
johannes arrived at daybreak from cairo he
remains invisible father spoke to him for a mo-
ment in his room he says that our friend is up-
set and exhausted as a result of the journey he
doesnt feel well and begs to be excused    i feel
terribly uneasy tomorrow morning or noon the
journey into space is to begin only a few hours
more and they too pass-without him 
from a letter of standertons to his friend van-
derstrassen 

  the last for a long while and if things go
wrong forever its really a curious situation in-
cidentally it seemed to me today as though baum-
gart were hesitating at the last moment he only
got here in the morning and retired to be alone
he sent for me in the evening asked if everything
was all right i told him that all we had to do was
to get into the rocket he remained silent for
some time and said suddenly wouldnt you prefer
after all to cancel the plan at the last moment
i laughed and told him that it was too late and that
i was not in the mood to be the joke of five contin-
ents he stared straight ahead for a while then
jumped up and said everything will happen as it
must happen i dont know-the conversation
struck me a bit queer between us two our learn-
ed friend is in love with hawthorns daughter and
she with him  if emotions count with him it
wouldnt be the first time that a great enterprise
had been destroyed by a woman see twelve vol-
umes of world history

  from elizabeths diary

october  midnight

  a night of depressing silence i feel more rest-
less than ever what an excellent consoler what
a merciful friend is sleep tonight it flees from
me eleven hours more and everything will be
over tremendous numbers of people are camping
in the fields tonight all of cape town and half
the province looks like an army camp thousands
of excursion ships are in the harbor    how i
hate these legions of the curious i wonder wheth-
er there are among them other hearts which feel
the imminence of a tragic fate when the space ship
ascends

  tonight the men who will start out into the un-
known met around our table father and sir
archibald insisted on it the latter imagined we
could have a gay farewell party and was very much
disappointed when events failed to take that
course he was as jolly as ever and full of jokes
standerton-quil was quite cool hes made of steel
springs the two mechanics were a little ill at
ease and were quiet all evening    johannes
came in only for a few minutes he was pale and
thoughtful spoke very little    several times he
looked at me with sad eyes but avoided speaking to
me    its a mystery i tried to get him alone
but he quite obviously evaded me im trying to
make him out is he becoming hesitant at the last
moment    one might almost think so from
what father said does he fear my prayers or
tears does he no longer trust himself to with-
stand them  he shook my hand in complete
silence when he went up to his room

  i wonder whether he is awake over there in his
little room-like me  his windows are dark
and yet perhaps he too is staring into the night

october  midnight

  its all over no not over yet    what will
the end be like puzzle piles on puzzle for me
i no longer understand either myself or the world
a will write it all down perhaps there will come a
day of solution and deliverance

  quite early things became very busy about the
starting place the laborers completed the last
preparations at the presidents seat were posts
of the guard of honor and a great sea of heads
was visible in every direction the green of the
fields and the brown of the ground were no longer
visible in any direction an ocean of white dark and
pink covered everything

  johannes went over there before sunrise old
brown told me about it baumgart said good-bye
to him and gave him some little souvenir  he
avoided me as he did yesterday i scarcely had
time to be alone with him for a second

 why why

  about nine oclock he had a long talk with fath-
er father said he showed most touching grati-
tude for the help we have given him and for the
time he spent in this house

and i     why did he run away from me

  shall i put down what happened over at the
starting place the newspapers have every de-
tail-how pale johannes looked when he spoke to
the president shaking his hand long and heartily
the president accompanied him over to the rudder
of the space-ship and fastened the flag to the guy-
wires with his own hand

then came the moment when my heart beat as
	wonder stories quarterly

though it would break the president returned to
his box johannes turned around and sought me
with his eyes groups of people were chattering
all around i tried to get a little way away from
them

  he came toward me slowly

  he had a serious reserved expression his
eyes looked sad and lowered before my gaze he
held out his hand

   thanks he said thanks for everything there
is nothing too beautiful or good for me to ask the
future to give you good-bye

  and when i tried to reply he raised his hand
and begged me

   out of your kindness grant me one more
wish-the last one lets part in silence words
destroy  

  these were the last sounds i heard from johan-
nes baumgart i pressed his hand once more and
offered him the fresh rose i had picked for him
to take with him

  for a moment it seemed as though he were
actually going to refuse it but several gentlemen
approached us he took it a kind of shadow seemed
to pass across his face    why why

he turned around and went over to the space ship

about eleven oclock standerton-quil and
droll old sir archibald came to bid me fare-
well the engineer was just the same as ever cool
and calm he seemed very resolute he said little
but i felt that what he said came from the heart
sir archibald had a strange elegiac expression
about his lips he made a few little jokes by way
of farewell but they were not in his best vein
the importance of the moment seemed to affect
him

  at eleven-fifteen they climbed through the win-
dow into the star of africa father was in charge
of things on the outside and the crowd left the
neighborhood of the space ship i saw the vehicle
glittering in the sun and the wind-tossed flag at her
stern all around it was very still but from the
distance one could hear the strange rustle and hum
of the countless thousands of people

  father stepped over to the window and gave a
final handshake all round the thick window-plates
were screwed tight father went round the ship
to the other side where the workmen were winching
the ship into position on the starting ramp and i
saw her prow rise slowly

  three minutes more i felt feverish all my
thoughts were confused but i was to see joh-
annes once more-probably for the last time in this
life innumerable eyes were directed toward the
ship but what did i care for the thoughts or
opinions of the world at such a moment

  from the low barrier i stepped toward the
machine johannes stood by the window i waved
toward him

  he did something strange mysterious inexpli-
cable i will retain the memory of it till my dying
day

  he looked at me with an expression almost of
pain shook his head sadly reached suddenly be-
hind him to the table wrote a few words on a slip
of paper and held it to the window it was a quo-
tation from goethe

   near ivas the friend now is she far tom lies
the wreath the blossoms are scattered

   he took the rose from the table the rose i had
given him and plucked off its petals  i saw the
red flakes fall like drops of blood

  everything became dark before my eyes i
think i fainted

  from a letter of representative coliman of the
cape district to high commissioner chak

  at eleven-thirty sharp the star of africa got
off with a roar accompanied by the applause of an
incalculable number of spectators sir archibald
plug sends you his best he seemed much moved
but as usual hid it under a feu-de-joie of jokes
the german was as pale as marble and remained
almost invisible hawthorns daughter fainted a
few minutes before the ship got off while she was
making a last farewell at the window they say
she and the german were interested in each other
its easy to believe she should be a good deal cut
up about this trip as the outcome seems difficult to
predict  your reports on the new food riots
in north america came this morning but  havent
gone through them yet more about that later

  from the records of the ministry of science of
the united states of africa

  the star of africa ascended at  the
following reports are to hand from the observation
posts

  cairo observatory-the space ship went be-
yond the range of the unaided eye within a few
minutes it would be observed through the tele-
scope for twenty minutes then being lost in the
clouds at the close of observation it appeared
with a magnification of  as a long bright flash
proceeding steadily and diminishing rapidly in dia-
meter details were no longer visible

  madras observatory-the space ship star of
africa was sighted from this point at  in the
comet-telescope as a luminous point two power-
ful telescopes were placed on it for further obser-
vation both were focussed on the vehicle and
were able to keep it in range until after sunset it
was visible in the night-sky as a fairly rapidly mov-
ing star until the rotation of the earth caused it to
set    attempts to locate the ship on the follow-
ing day were without success

  wireless station bagamojo-two hours after
the departure of the star of africa at  we re-
ceived the following message star of africa to
government zanzibar-are approximately 
kilometers above atmosphere everything in or-
der another message was received at  p m
but was only partially decipherable the distance
having become too great for the sending set of the
space-ship the following words were definitely
detected star  zanzibar     
zanzibar      none    

  then the government received the first message
cylinder it had dropped near lalipore in india
with its magnesium flare well alight it showed
that two others which never arrived had preceded
it the platinum ribbon contained the following
message

   message no  we are exactly one radius
of the earth away from the planet it is visible as
a huge disc and we can see the whole surface from
the north pole to the south one-thirtieth of the
the cosmic cloud	

journey has been accomplished all participants
are affected by vertigo we regard it as a kind of
interplanetary seasickness and hope to overcome it
nothing else worthy of note

  a message was received from captain braganza
of the steamer sospir del mare on the night of
the th the ship observed a slowly-descending
bright light at a point west of the azores its
velocity was too slow for it to be a meteorite the
captain was convinced that it was a message cy-
linder from the star of africa they steered tow-
ard the spot but were unable to find any trace of
the cylinder

  a message cylinder also dropped near saratow
in russia the second and last which was received
by the government it bore the number  and
was dated as of the evening of the th

  the platinum ribbon contained the following

   we have almost half the distance behind us
the earth floats in the distance like a huge moon
she is veiled in dense clouds which thin out only
near the equator none of us feels quite as well as
we could wish sir archibald and samha are par-
ticularly overcome and must spend a good deal of
time resting yesterday a nut-sized meteorite
penetrated the control-chamber missing stander-
ton by a hairs breadth  we suffer from cold
baumgart had to lie down an hour ago if our
difficulties increase we intend to return before
reaching the god in spite of baumgarts pro-
tests 

chapter xxiii

darkness

the government never received any other mes-
sage these last discouraging words remained
the farewell from the space travellers everything
else is darkness and doubt

  three further message cylinders were seen to
fall but were not found one dropped into the
ocean near hawaii one descended into the alps
and the third fell in the icy wastes of the czuchen
peninsula although the rewards offered stimu-
lated extensive searches for these cylinders they
remained undiscovered   

  the space ship was sighted for the last time on
october  in the giant reflector of the cairo ob-
servatory by ben-haffa voorthuizen and grag-
rano since its steering point was delta capricor-
ni and since its approximate distance from the
earth was known the locality in which it could be
found was calculable as in the case of a comet for
ten days unfavorable weather conditions at cairo
did not permit of observation on the th the
skies cleared and after some search a slowly mov-
ing luminous point was located in the constella-
tion aquarius according to the unanimous op-
inions of the observers this could only represent
the star of africa

  this was later disputed by rawlinson of the cape
observatory who demonstrated that an asteroid
was near the point at the time and the matter was
thrown into still further doubt by the melbourne
observatory which reported the space ship on the
following night at a point so far distant that at
least one of the observations must have been an

error as the experts were unable to reach any
agreement how could the public decide as luck
would have it the unfavorable weather endured
for several weeks the sun and moon barely pene-
trated the clouds in spite of all efforts it was
impossible to make another observation on the
feebly luminous point

  newspapers and scientific societies all over the
world were occupied with the question of the fate
of the enterprise and one might say that humanity
concentrated its attention on the star of africa for
the next weeks even the wildest rumors were re-
ceived with interest

  small wonder than that there was immense ex-
citement when the worlds newspapers printed the
following bulletin on november 

  the captain and officers of the s s lizard
which arrived at bahia on nov  have made the
following statement on november  about  pm
we were in  degrees  longitude and  degrees
 of southern latitude we heard a strong in-
creasingly rapid sound in the air not unlike that
of a high-powered rocket car looking upward
we saw a dark mass of considerable dimensions at
a distance of about six kilometers it fell dispers-
ing a number of glowing sparks and splinters the
object plunged into the ocean the ship was im-
mediately pointed in that direction but no traces
of the object were discovered except a whitish
powder which seemed to cover the surface of the
ocean over a considerable area the size of the ob-
ject was estimated by all on board as at least one
hundred cubic meters

               signed

           frederick patterson capt lizard
smith glasier oversmann officers
the watchkeeper of a guardship stationed near
this point had also noticed the apparition from
his viewpoint the object looked as large as the
lizard which was clearly visible to him he stated
that a considerable part of the mass descended in
a rain of sparks considerably earlier and at some
distance from the main fall

  it was very easy to interpret this occurrence in-
to the fall of the star of africa the only alter-
native seemed to be the arrival of a giant meteorite
against this assumption must be set the facts that
such meteors are so extremely rare that the worlds
history notes only three or four such cases and in
this case no one heard the thunder which is char-
acteristic of such meteor-falls

  on the other hand hawthorn and the engineers
emphasized the fact that in the case of such a catas-
trophe as this theory assumed the star of africa
would never have descended as a single unit just
as meteorites are heated white-hot in their passage
through the atmosphere the space ship would have
so increased in temperature thanks to the friction
of the air that the usambaranite charges contained
in it would have exploded and the quantity of ex-
plosive carried would have been sufficient to re-
duce the entire body of the space ship to frag-
ments if the mysterious meteorite had been the
star of africa they would have seen nothing but a
terrific explosion at a high altitude a lightning-like
flash and a rain of tiny fragments the space
ship would have been reduced to dust and ashes
against this others argued that the travellers
	wonder stories quarterly

would have jettisoned the explosive at the last mo-
ment to avoid just such a danger

  again it was a case of opinion against opinion

  the government of the united states of south
america ordered two deep-sea dredges with diving
equipment to proceed to the locality at once it
was an act more of good will than anything else
since the admiralty had little doubt that it would
be impossible to lift the sunken body as the ocean
was more than  fathoms deep at this point
as a matter of fact no traces of the fallen body
were discovered at three points deep-sea photo-
graphing apparatus was lowered but the negatives
showed no peculiarities

  the watchkeeper of the guardship said simply
the ocean is wide and deep you would stand
more chance of finding a sewing needle in an entire
cornfield than a body in the sea

  some portions of the greyish-white dust were
recovered from the sea investigation showed that
it was metallic in character and had been subjected
to great heat    this seemed to substantiate the
star of africa theory

  the public followed the news with the closest at-
tention speculation as to whether the travellers
would reach their goal and return ran riot

the tenth of november arrived the old faith-
ful companion of the earth remained impas-
sively in its place continuing calmly and evenly
in its orbit as it always had the pale face looked
down indifferently on the earth and the silly little
men who had ventured out into space in a fit of
megalomania

  dr ben-hafta and his assistants had kept an
incessant watch on the slowly waxing crescent
through their giant reflector at the line which
parted the moons day and night the surface of the
mare imbrium and the silvery battlements of the
mountain chain of the lunar apennines were vis-
ible

  ben-haffa and voorthuizen examined the edge
with the closest attention but the day passed with-
out a trace of the star of af rica during the en-
suing evening voorthuizen finally leaped into ben-
haffas room after hours of observation

  the star of africa has arrived they are
there come on-hurry up the dutchman
raced from the room ben-haffa half-clothed hast-
ening behind him quite out of breath they ar-
rived at the deep shaft of the giant reflector

  its gone i cant see the luminous point any
longer said voorthuizen stepping back from the
observation seat breathing heavily a tiny lumin-
ous point he declared had been visible at the rim
of the light side of the moon he could see it only
with the greatest effort and it undoubtedly would
have escaped his attention had it not moved very
slowly the light had gradually swung over to
the dark side of the moon returning after a few
minutes he had hurried to bring ben-haffa as a
witness

  the latter stared steadily at the dark side of
the moon and suddenly gripped voorthuizens arm
with painful force yes there it is-a tiny lum-
inous point very slowly it steered toward the
illuminated portion of the moon escaping observa-
tion in the flood of light throughout the night

the two astronomers continued their observation
but the object did not appear again

  ben-hafta and his assistant clung to the convic-
tion that they had seen the star of africa just
descending on the moon for the rest of their lives
who dared to oppose the opinion of two such res-
pected scientists

  nevertheless there were plenty of voices who
warned against basing the assumption that the
travellers had actually reached the moon on this
single observation a number of experienced as-
tronomers adhered to rawlinsons opinion that the
pollen of various flowers carried high up into
the air by aerial currents and lighted up by the
solar radiation is visible in large telescopes and
that such a body had deceived the cairo observers
this was the more probable as the younger obser-
vers at the cairo observatory had several times
noticed such faint floating points of light

  once more the footprints in the sand were ob-
literated

  there remained nothing but waiting

  with the greatest excitement the world awaited
the middle of november on the thirteenth or at
the latest on the sixteenth the travellers were due
to return no trace of them hope remained
the company which had provided the provisions
for the expedition announced that with care the
supply might last ten or even fourteen days more
the deep sea diving corporation of bombay de-
clared that the supply of compressed air would
last approximately six days beyond what the dura-
tion of the journey called for until the twenty-
sixth of november the travellers could breathe
their food would last until the third of december

  both dates passed without a trace of the star of
africa in mid-december the space ship had to be
declared lost since no possibility of their survival
any longer existed

  the ministry of science called together a com-
mittee with mr albarnell at its head rawlinson
ben-haffa and hawthorn were members as a re-
sult of the meeting the government published the
following report on the outcome of the enterprise
on january 

  the star of africa and its courageous crew
must be regarded as lost

  the last message cylinder brought the report
that the travellers were ill from the effects of the
voyage the thought of returning was contem-
plated it is possible that all members of the ex-
pedition became incapable of operating the en-
gines and steering gear the vehicle thus getting out
of control because of the lack of a directing hand

  it is possible that large meteors smashed the
space ship or destroyed vital parts in either case
it would fall

  it is possible that the usambaranite charges
were ignited and blew up

  in case the vehicle was already within the lunar
field of gravity it would fall onto the moon in frag-
ments if its destruction occurred within the ter-
restrial field of gravity it would fall to the earth

  since large areas of the earth are covered by
oceans lonely mountains and uninhabited jungles
the space ship might easily have escaped observa-
tion since few points on our planet are free of
clouds perhaps the officers of the lizard actually
the cosmic cloud	

did see the space ship fall into the south atlantic
the improved diving apparatus of the future alone
can clarify this question or perhaps the remains
of the star of africa will some day be found in a
desert or ice-field

  finally it is not impossible that the expedition
reached its goal and suffered fatal damage in des-
cending to the surface of the moon the vehicle
might have been destroyed or rendered incapable
of ascending to return in such a case the brave
travellers would perish in a short time

  to the government of the united states of
africa remains only the sad duty of honoring the
explorers by erecting a monument to those who fell
in the interest of suffering humanity and of caring
for their dependents

needless to say the unfortunate outcome of
the plan aroused the liveliest compassion
throughout the world for months for more than
a year a thousand possibilities were discussed in
the columns of the newspapers and a thousand
fantastic rumors given to the public but interest
gradually ebbed new events wiped out the mem-
ory of the old conditions in northern america
became more and more aggravated famines and
the inefficient methods of the canadian government
in dealing with them forced the masses to help
themselves bloody riots occurred and starving
mobs moved south meeting fierce resistance gen-
uine battles were fought and humanity seemed once
more on the edge of a plunge into barbarism

  in africa the immigration of twenty million
europeans brought about considerable difficulties
with attendant friction in march came an im-
mense shower of ashes and for three weeks the
sun remained practically invisible throughout the
world the day was announced only by a ruddy
dim dawn heavy rains descended and north and
south were glaciated to an increasing degree the
alpine glaciers descended to lake constance and to
the line milan-verona-venice in south aus-
tralia as well there were riots navigation was
paralyzed for fourteen days and increased the al-
ready poignant difficulties of feeding the multi-
tudes the ocean became a labyrinth of icebergs
almost impossible to navigate in the rain and dark-
ness the star of africa was forgotten in the
pressure of events

  here and there people continued to think about
the problem for months and years the aging
ben-haffa stared into the glittering mountain-laby-
rinth of the moon through his giant reflector more
and more powerful prisms were attached and sev-
eral times he believed he had discovered the re-
mains of the riven space-ship his friends wor-
ried about the state of his eyes begged him to
desist but he continued to stare at the bright
disc seeking the traces of his vanished friends

  amid a thousand other problems the announce-

the

 ment of the death of the well-known senator from
 the nile district mme khadija effrem-latour
 caused some stir toward the latter end of january
  she was a victim of heart-disease it was
 said because of the effect of the death of her aged
 mother in cairo a rumor to the effect that the
 beautiful and brilliant woman had willingly parted
 from life was circulated this was but little cred-
 ited as she seemed to have no reason for leaving
 the world it was rather odd that just before her
 death she had left a note asking that in case she
 died she be buried in that part of the grove of
 zadphe where the little pavilion stood

   it was done as she had wished and on the little
 stone that marked her grave the words she herself
 had left for the purpose was written

   happiness is the foam on a wave whoever
 rises with it knows that behind the crest comes the
 valley

   nobody was able to tell where the line had been
 taken from

	  

   the old moon still moves in its orbit and looks
 through the gaps in the clouds onto the active life
 of earth where a thousand flowers are blooming
 and misfortune happiness and sorrow rise and
 flames are blazing and where the scales of fortune
 and misfortune happiness and sorrow rise and
 fall for the moon all that is long since over

   into dark canyons and through the leafy roofs
 of the forest falls its light its image is mirrored
 in lakes and pales in the street-lights of great
 cities where hearts beat high with hatred and
 love work and pleasure

   its radiant beams reach far they creep across
 the white wall of the dreamy grove of zadphe
 where tall dark trees reach up into the night long
 shadows run across the narrow paths of sand no
 longer trod by the dainty foot of woman they
 count the ten moss-covered gravestones of the
 wives of the caliph selim and at midnight when
 the nightingale sings on the rose-hedge they ten-
 derly caress the new gravestones which stands
 among the plants

   how far they reach the rays of the pallid star
 of night they are mirrored in the long range
 of windows of the hospital of colchester and fall
 on the mild still face of the kind old lady in the
 white cap of the sisters of mercy who leans at the
 window looking out into the silent night with
 eyes that are full of mute questions at the same
 moment its rays tremble about the tall obelisk
 which rises before a strange array of tracks and
 wheels that point toward the sky weather-worn
 and rusted

   the black obelisk is embroidered with silver in
 the moonlight at its foundation a full-blown rose
 in stone is visible and below it is written

fear of the gods should be in au men most of all

i was weak and exhausted when like a huge rotating ball the mother world
     loomed before me

 
jkiez hulan and i were
l classmates at the martian
 university of fomar he
traced his ancestry back two
hundred years to  a d
to the time when his forebears
migrated from the earth with a colonizing ex-
pedition my father allon kestron had brought
his family from venus to the
martian city of fomar fa-
ther was inspired with a rov-
ing spirit we were always on
the go between the three
worlds i was born in the
venusian city of deliphon

  when i entered the univer-
sity at foraar i ceased the
nomadic life that i might
round out my education mo-
ther always held fond hopes
for my success poor soul be-
fore i completed my years at
fomar she passed away to a
world which cannot be reached
in space ships

 for companionship at fo-
mar university and because his
course of study paralled mine

i gained an intimate
acquaintances h i p
with nez hulan

nez was an ex-
tremely likeable
chap his manner
was affable and his
ways courteous he
was popular and
well liked by both
students and in-
structors nez and
i spent a good
share of our time
in the laboratory
together experi-
menting

  we soon came to
know one anothers
peculiarities tastes
and ambitions our
viewpoints were
much the same

one point on which
we differed was in
our regard for the
opposite sex nez
waa forever emerging from one love affair to
fall into another heart tangle i was not a la-
dies man i never loved but one woman-zelna
larice unfortunately for me nez also became
fascinated with her loveliness and charm

  i was a bit backward in the art of love while
nez was always at ease and master of his emo-
tions and speech nez was a handsome chap
there was no denying that and he captured the
love of our charming classmate at fomar golden
haired zelna my timid though well intentioned
efforts yielded only a warm friendship and she
remained unaware of my passionate regard fos

her i completely disguised
my true feelings when i real-
ized her love for nez

  most unsuccessful lovers
would have hated nez my
attitude for him however re-
mained the same as always he was my best
friend and i wished him luck

  our years at fomar rolled
onward my secret love for
zelna grew stronger there
was no other girl but her
often i was with her and nez
-sometimes with her alone
but always i masked my wor-
ship of her beneath the bonds
of friendship i am sorry to
say that nez was not always
true to her during their en-
gagement he had many sec-
ret affairs quite by accident
i was a witness to one of these
acts of infidelity and my con-
science suffered i could not
however bring myself to warn
zelna

  one day zelna and i strolled
together through the universi-
tys garden she
seemed strangely
unhappy in reply
to my query con-
cerning her low
spirits zelna be-
came confidential
she had learned of
nezs faithlessness
there had been
scandalous reports
regarding a certain
woman i m p u -
sively i blurted
out a few kind
words in nezs be-
half zelna came
close my heart
throbbed as she
pressed her pretty
head upon m y
shoulder and kissed
my cheek it was
the nearest to the
peak of happiness
i had ever come
i fought savagely
against a consuming desire to crush her lovely
figure in my arms-to smother her lips with
kisses

  dear reene she murmured youll make
some girl very happy

  there was my chance i might have seized
the advantage but the bonds of friendship were
strong within me and i respected my friend in
spite of his weak character self control ruled
over passion though had zelna remained an-
other moment at my side it is probable the
course of many lives would have been altered

when men succeed in building space ships and
have explored the nearby planets they will have
satisfied for a time their thirst for adventure so
many new experiences so much of startling discov-
eries will fall to the astronaut that it will take him
quite a time to recover from it

   but even then it cannot be assumed that his thirst
 will be satisfied forever there are nine solar plan-
 ets to be explored a dozen or so of planetary moons
 and countless asteroids each one offers to him a
 new set of conditions to meet dangers to face knowl-
 edge to be gained

   of the asteroids that belt of planetary fragments
 that lie between mars and jupiter we know little in-
 timately there are countless numbers of them the
 thousand islands of space and each one offers
 something new to ambitious explorers although
 they are too small to support life they should offer
 as our author shows in this unusual story enough
 adventures to satisfy anyone for a lifetime
	wonder stories quarterly

good graces of zelna i never forgot that day
in the garden nor the electrifying contact of
zelnas lips following their reunion nez be-
came a bit more sly and careful rather than
faithful and true the old life would not die
out

  in laboratory class and on recreation field
nez and i enjoyed many pleasant hours and so
our years at fomar passed away into memory
eventually the year of our graduation rolled
around we came through with flying colors
especially nez zelna had still a years work be-
fore her

  for my lifes work i could decide on no par-
ticular vocation i had inherited too much of
my fathers adventurous spirit to settle down for
long in one position i was offered a position
at the university as an assistant instructor in
mathematics which i decided to accept for the
time being until my objective in life became
more definite

nez received an offer to accompany an expe-
dition bound for the asteroids those tiny
worlds which lay clustered between mars and
mighty jupiter incidentally i also received an
offer to go nez urged me to accompany them
finding that my position at fomar still awaited
me when i returned i signed up with the expe-
dition i wish now that i had never gone the
ways of destiny are indeed complex and i was
destinys tool

  we were expected to be gone only a few
months zelna bade us a tearful farewell she
and nez were to be married on his return

  our expedition comprised six members in-
cluding maris rourke the commander rourke
was a veteran space traveller having seen many
strange parts of the solar system

  the asteroids at the time of our contemplated
start were in conjunction with mars had they
not been our trip would have been considerably
longer it happened also that mars was in con-
junction with the earth

  i shall never forget my first glimpse of the
asteroids our detector warned us that we were
approaching one of the little worlds we all
watched through the transparent panelling of the
port the asteroid loomed before us the far off
sun lighting up its eerie crags like a jagged
mountain it appeared the shadows sharp etched
in bold relief across the sunlit half i judged
the diameter of the planetoid to be five miles

  for the next month we wound our way in and
out among the tiny worlds donning space
suits we spent much time in exploring their cold
dead surfaces one day-i say day because
we were conducting a daily routine according to
martian time-rourke came to me

  kestron im giving you a dangerous mission

  yes sir

  it is your privilege to refuse if you wish

  what is it i inquired

  do you remember the crater hole we discov-
ered yesterday-on the asteroid out there

  i nodded

  i want you to explore its depths and report
to us by radio are you game

   certainly

  nez came up to where we stood may i go
with reene he asked

  i waited hoping rourke would let him go
with me the commander wrinkled his brow and
scratched his head no hulan im afraid not
i want to keep you here to help repair the radium
repeller rays they havent been working any too
well lately the meteors have been coming en-
tirely too close for comfort

  the space ship stood off from the asteroid
several miles while i donned my space suit and
prepared to explore the deep crater the aster-
oid was one of the smaller variety with a diame-
ter of twenty miles or less i soon located the
crater and swung down into it the lights on my
space suit were unnecessary for i found the
rough sides of the shaft luminescent

  rourke had been right in his assertion that
the mission was dangerous rough crags threat-
ened to tear open my space suit releasing my
oxygen supply into the airless void taking
drops of several hundred feet at a time floating
down the center of the great shaft i found that
the crater hole extended deep into the asteroid
from time to time i radioed reports to rourke
through the phone in my helmet he sent back
encouragement and instructions

  the crater seemed endless in length i had
plumbed its depth for miles when suddenly i
shot down into a vast spherical cavern my
body bobbed back and forth across this subter-
ranean cavity like a pendulum finally coming to
rest in the very center i floated free as if in
space the crater had brought me into the very
center of the asteroid i shouted my discovery to
rourke he replied-then his voice was cut
off by a sharp click

  shadowy forms closed in upon me something
seized my neck in a tight grip raising my atomic
pistol i fired into a hideous face which stared
into mine dismal creatures on leathern wings
flew all about me once again i fired my atom
gun this time over my shoulder the clutch on
my neck was released i became aware of a
strange atmosphere about me a horny beak
snapped at me as a dark form flapped past

  with the reaction attachment on my suit i
propelled myself back in the direction of the
shaft the bat creatures attacked me viciously
so that often i was hard set my blazing atomic
pistol cleared a way for me and i shot up the
shaft the winged terrors of the asteroid in pur-
suit they followed only a short distance how-
ever in the upper reaches of the crater the at-
mosphere in which they lived became thin event-
ually dying away into vacuum

disaster near

hen i emerged from the crater i was sur-
prised to find the space ship gone my ra-
diophone calls brought no reply the ship with
my five companions had vanished and i was
alone i grew near to hysterical with a sudden
realization of my dreadful position then i
thought of my detector all space suits were
equipped with one
the asteroid of death	

  consulting the detector i found the space ship
located in the general direction of the asteroids
antipode using the reaction equipment i shot
away into space circling the asteroid in search
of the ship i could conceive of no reason for
rourkes change of position and i was a bit
anxious it was not like rourke to do this with-
out notifying me

  finally i discovered the ship it was moving
erratically shifting slowly around the little
asteroid at a distance of several miles i sent
out a call-and received no answer my heart
jumped into my throat as i took in the horror of
the situation the space ship was twisted and
bent a ragged hole gaped at me from one side
of the derelict the answer to the tragedy was
all too apparent the radium repeller rays had
failed and a wandering meteor had done the
rest

  coming alongside the wreck i entered the
control room through the jagged rent torn in the
side what i had anticipated i saw my five
comrades lay dead three of them mangled be-
yond description though i saw nothing but
what i had expected the sight of nez hulan
gave me a distinct shock one leg was gone-
an arm torn away-his skull was fractured a
long metal stanchion pierced his left side

  i was seized with an intense loneliness i
too was doomed-unless-

  i hurried to the observation chamber my
startled eyes seeking our ships radio sending
outfit it was shattered i could send no word
for help the radiophone in my helmet was
capable of transmitting sound only a short dist-
ance

  from the observation chamber i descended in-
to the machine room the mechanism was near-
ly intact the only damage done had occurred
from the shock of the meteors blow and not
from direct contact it might yet be possible to
reach mars if i found it possible to make the
necessary repairs and adjustments

  the mechanism which afforded the ship mo-
tive power was the only apparatus to which i
gave my attention success rewarded my efforts
and the ship under my control sped toward
mars

  the air rejuvenator on the back of my space
suit functioned perfectly else six instead of five
corpses would have tenanted the space ship my
biggest problem was food and drink though
there was plenty aboard the craft it was impos-
sible to get it to my mouth the vacuum of
space permeated the entire ship and i dared not
remove my helmet

  endless days must have passed as alone with-
out food or sleep i guided the craft toward the
dark orb of mars then came hours of stupor

when i was hardly aware of being alive

then i must have dozed or fallen into uncon-
sciousness for when i finally awoke i discovered
with horror that i had passed beyond mars and
with my accelerated speed and the suns attrac-
tion i was being drawn toward the solar furnace

  only one thing would save me to try to con-
nect with the earth and to make a landing there
with feverish intentness now fully awake to my

danger i worked at the controls guiding the
craft toward the bright star that was the earth

  i was weak and exhausted when like a huge
rotating ball the mother world loomed before
me i slackened the speed of the ship to a mini-
mum as i raced into the upper reaches of the
atmosphere

  weird wailing and shrieking noises whistled
outside an ethereal glow of pale radiance re-
placed the blackness of space i exploded seve-
ral reverse charges to check my meteoric speed
as the earths great face overwhelmed my vision
the ship now dropped slowly down upon the
vast continent of north america ten miles
above the surface it grew unbearably hot inside
my space suit yet i dared remove no part of it a
dizzy sickening feeling assailed me

  with the wind howling about the wrecked
space ship which i knew must now run wild if i
lost my senses i became desperate and removed
my helmet the cold rarefied atmosphere over-
come me instantly and i sank unconscious among
my dead comrades

i stared up at a white ceiling a head pro-
jected itself between my eyes and the ceiling
where-where am i i asked

  in cleveland

  did the ship come down safe

  no-it crashed

  then how am i-

  the hospital attendant smiled you were
seen descending while many miles above the
earth you landed in the ocean and you and the
rest of your crew were fished out you were
nearly dead when they brought you here what
happened to your expedition

  briefly i told him then  asked him a ques-
tion which had been bothering me how long
have i been here

  only a few days

  days

  yes i have other surprising news for you
too several of the surgeons here are conducting
a rather elaborate experiment on your dead
friend nez hulan they are bringing him back
to life

  impossible

you must realize he and the rest of your
companions were killed under strange circum-
stances the coldness of space preserved them-
they had not yet started to bleed when we
found your ship dropping down out of the sky
but his head was fractured i deplored
the surgeons have given him an aluminum
cranium with radiophone ears his brain has
been replaced in the aluminum brain pan
his heart was pierced by a piece of the ships
wreckage

  true indeed replied the attendant smiling
in tolerant amusement at my stupid surprise
the damaged organ has been removed and a
rubber heart substituted

  hell never live i cried aghast at such a
strange revelation

  hes alive now-but hes unconscious

  the strange news stirred me deeply my in-
	wonder stories quarterly

formant continued his story which seemed hard
to conceive as reality

  what little was left of his legs and arms were
useless to him they were amputated already
an inventor working in collaboration with the
surgeons has promised to equip the man with
metal arms and legs which he may use quite
handily

  why-hes nearly a machine i exclaimed
practically a robot

  well about half and half id call him a
human robot

what happened to the other-er-corpses
if you recollect the others were beyond any
repair they were rejected by the surgeons who
selected hulans body for the great test
when-when will he recover-so that i may
talk with him i asked

  not for several months you see well not
let him regain consciousness until the stumps of
his severed limbs have healed

  the next day i was discharged from the hos-
pital as cured i lost little time in speeding
across the cosmic void to fomar apprising zelna
of the strange news assuring her that her lover
would be saved

  oh-its wonderful she exclaimed her eyes
glistening and you-you saved him for me
i left her a bit too abruptly i fear and went
in search of professor crayton i dared not re-
main in her presence longer though her grati-
tude was to me a treasure divine yet i feared it
-feared that my mask would drop

  my position as instructor awaited me at
once i plunged into the work at hand striving to
forget the endless night of horror following my
trip to the asteroids we all looked forward to
nezs recovery especially zelna and i

  one day a month later while walking across a
large hall of the university someone hailed me
from behind i turned a man hurried toward
me in lengthy strides he was no one i had
ever seen before and then as he came closer
i recognized him it was nez hulan i was
amazed at the transformation death and the sur-
gical instruments had worked upon him

  two gleaming metal arms swung by his side
his face wore a dead white color just an inch
above his eyebrows an aluminum cranium coin-
cided neatly with flesh and bone his clothing
concealed his mechanical legs which i later
learned carried him easily without extra effort
the aluminum cranium appeared like a tight
helmet a radiophone ear projected from each
side of his head his appearance was grotesque
in the extreme he smiled at my surprise then
he spoke

  greetings reene surprised to see me so
soon

 why-yes-rather i managed to exclaim
it was scarcely a month ago when you were
operated upon in cleveland

  i know he replied since then my recov-
ery has been rapid

back from the dead

there was a strange metallic click to his
voice which i had never before heard his

steel fingers closed upon mine in a handshake i
thought he was going to break the bones in my
hand with difficulty i repressed a scream of
pain the smile crossed his face again he
seemed to realize yet he made no apologies

  thanks to you im back here alive again
he said

  zelna will be glad to see you i told him
she has been waiting

  very good ill go and see her presently
how do you feel  i asked both curious and
solicitous as to the general outcome of the sur-
gical operations

  pretty well he replied im thinking of
settling down here as an instructor if i can
qualify again the smile spread crookedly
across his pasty countenance

  thats fine i enthused you may cer-
tainly depend on me to help you all i can and
then i questioned him in regards to the manner
in which the space ship had been wrecked he
proved thetruth of my previous theory

  you were lucky to be on the asteroid rourke
and i were tinkering with the radium repeller
rays-then oblivion

  youre a living wonder said i marvelling
at his weird experience

  a freak you mean

  i felt a bit hurt at the words his lips
curled once more in the enigmatic smile i
thought it strange that he did not laugh in the
old days nez hulan had laughed often and
heartily we discussed other topics in which we
held mutual interests

  always i noticed the strange note in his voice
when he talked loud his voice was rasping his
smile suggested amused contempt yet i believed
this effect due to his recent illness merely an in-
voluntary facial contortion he seemed strange-
ly cold utterly devoid of all warmth of char-
acter this too i believed he would overcome
what might one expect so quickly after the ex-
periences the man had undergone

  i saw zelna later after she had talked with
nez

  how terrible he looks she emphasized
and he acts so unnatural-so strange
what can you expect i asked her hell
be himself once more zelna when hes had a
chance to recuperate

  i hope so she said gravely were to be
married

  when i asked a sudden chill striking my
heart

  no definite date whenever i think nez is
well-completely cured

  but he seems well enough now said i re-
membering the tremendous pressure of nezs
handsake

  thats not it reene cant you see the dif-
ference its his mind im sure

  nez hulan was successful in his efforts at se-
curing a position with fomar university he
became a medical instructor an assistant to pro-
fessor climm i was pleased with his success and
waited for the reversion to his old character
which i hopefully expected

 but i was doomed to disappointment nez
the asteroid of death	

hulan remained cold and indifferent like the
robot he so nearly resembled he became practi-
cal to the extreme the strange adventure he
had undergone had not dulled his intelligence
by any means he proved this in many ways
foremost in my memory is an event which took
place one day when a question regarding super-
mathematics had me stumped nez solved it for
me instantly and i was amazed at his brain
power his unusual ingenuity

  why nez youve discovered a new mathemat-
ical formula to govern those questions i ex-
claimed it ia much better than the old one
nez the light glittering from his metal skull
wore an attitude of satisfaction and supercilious
contempt i later came to the conclusion that
the removal of his brains from the fractured
skull to the aluminum substitute had stimu-
lated them into greater activity

   as the months passed by other instructors al-
so discovered his super intellect and they re-
spected it they also became aware of his cold
contemptuous manner and were repelled by it
nez hulan became exceedingly unpopular and i
myself was rather discouraged with him zelna
and i remained practically his only constant as-
sociates he seemed not to care he had be-
come a super-intellectual human robot i came
to doubt whether he had a soul to this day i
believe he was recalled to life without one

  one night i was awakened by a muffled
scream which brought me out of a sound sleep
it was not repeated and so i was not sure but
what i had dreamed it i had eaten heartily
that evening of certain venusian vegetables which
had never seemed to agree with me they had
caused me nightmares before

i opened a window to let in the fresh air of a
clear crisp martian night i leaned out the
window the sky was clear both moons of mars
riding high in the heavens phobos moved per-
ceptibly away from deimos with its faster speed
my room is located directly beneath hulans
laboratory out of the laboratory window above
me there came a bright flash of iridescence which
shot away into the night disappearing fear-
ing an accident i hurried upstairs to the labora-
tory to my utmost surprise hulan himself
emerged from the laboratory closing the door
behind him

  did i disturb you reene he asked with un-
usual politeness

  what was the flash out the window nez
was there an explosion

  you heard no concussion did you

  no

  i was experimenting with a new device for
the release of atomic energy the flash you saw
was the ejection of exploded atoms

  i went back to bed realizing that hulans
zealous efforts had kept him up later than usual

  the next morning professor crayton ap-
proached me in my study say kestron
where are the new rocket tubes we were supposed
to have

  arent they here yet i asked burton

should have brought them up from the supply
room

  havent seen burton all morning

  thats strange i observed i havent seen
him either hes always around here some-
wheres

  the call went out for burton the laboratory
attendant he was not found several days
passed still he put in no appearance the
mystery deepened no reason was apparent for
his leaving so suddenly and quietly there had
been no thefts and burtons character was above
the possibility of a scandal

  occasionally i saw zelna but usually she
avoided me a shroud seemed draped over her
characteristic gayety she was strangely op-
pressed and it took but little reasoning to real-
ize why my heart ached for her zelnas vivac-
ious manner had changed to a listless attitude
and a dull hopeless light shone in her blue eyes
my concern for her happiness grew intense but
again i felt that it was none of my affair that
i had no business prying into other peoples per-
sonal affairs

  upon the third day following burtons disap-
pearance i made a startling find underneath
my window scattered on the purple sward i
found several small bits of metal examining
the pieces closely i found them to be buttons
curiously bent warped and twisted i recognized
them they were buttons which i myself had
made from kinolurin a queer metal which pro-
fessor crayton had brought back with him from
one of jupiters moons i had sewed them on a
laboratory coat of mine the coat had been a
bit too small for me and i had given it to bur-
ton

 the association of thoughts stimulated by the
discovery of the buttons under my window raced
like lightning through my head i recollected
the muffled scream which had awakened me a
few nights previous-the strange ejection of iri-
descence from hulans laboratory window above
mine-hulans unusual courtesy towards me-
the disappearance of burton on the following
morning i had found a clue to burtons disap-
pearance

  hulan had murdered burton he had disinte-
grated his body into atoms substantiating this
theory was the fact that the kinolurin metal i
exceedingly difficult to disintegrate i shuddered
at the thought hulan had lured burton to the
laboratory and had made him a subject for one
of his ghastly experiments in a manner un-
known to me the machine man had reduced bur-
tons body to its component atoms shooting them
out the laboratory window into the stillness of
the night burtons scream had awakened me

  it was horrible to know and yet be unable to
act a killer one of the worst kind known to
mankind was at large in the university of fo-
mar i dared say nothing for i had only strong
suspicions and but the flimsiest of proofs it
was revolting to know that the best friend i had
ever possessed was a cold-blooded murderer

  that very day while my mind was in a whirl-
ing chaos of conflicting thoughts and resolutions
	wonder stories quarterly

zelna came rushing into my study where i sat
alone tears coursed down her pretty face

  oh reene i cant stand it any longer-i
cant go on with it

tell me i comforted her whats wrong
she dried her tears on a tiny square of white
linen pulled herself together and faced me
never in all my days have i been called upon to
look into such sorrowful eyes

  im not going to marry nez she said quiet-
ly i cant do it hes not the kind of man i
want not just because of his new appearance
i realize now how silly ive been all the time it
was a mad infatuation its taken all this to-
to bring me to my senses

  why i exclaimed a bit awkwardly bewild-
ered with so many startling events theres no
law to make you go through with it-youre
free

the fiend awakens

  she came and sat down beside me her clear
honest eyes looking straight into mine as if
searching for something beyond reene do you
remember that day in the garden-when i kissed
you i felt my blood tingle and leap through
my veins as she laid a hand upon my arm
wasnt there something you held back from me
-something you wanted to say

  yes i replied too tongue tied to say more
do-do you want to say it now she asked
giving way to my impulses and ripping down
the barriers of restraint which i had kept
erected so long i seized her in my arms and
kissed her lovely face and lips she was mine
woe to any man who tried to take her from me

  reene-i was blind not to have realized it
long before this-you loved me all the time-
and i was a fool a silly fool

  we must tell nez i said its the right
thing to do

  dont bother yourself spoke a rasping
voice in the doorway stood nez hulan take
her and be damned

  with these words he strode from the room
the very next morning the sting of death
struck again professor climm was found dead
in his room every bone in his body removed in
spme mysterious manner professor craytons
discovery threw the entire university into a fur-
ore following the general alarm i was one of
the first to reach the scene and view the body
by some weird process every bone in professor
climms body was gone not a single scar mar-
red his flesh the preceding night he had re-
tired to his room well and healthy now his
flesh a shapeless mound of jelly lay cold on the
floor of his room

  i alone recognized the fiendish ingenuity of
nez hulan this new horror was the latest
brain child of his perverted genius how he had
accomplished the insidious removal of the bony
structure was beyond my power to ascertain but
that he was guilty i was willing to swear i
decided to bring him to account for the act
resolutely i started for his laboratory when
i entered he appeared not to have noticed the

confusion outside i made no preliminary ad-
vances but went to the heart of the subject with
brutal bluntness

  nez youve murdered your superior youve
killed professor climm

  he expressed genuine surprise the sudden
accusation coming so totally unexpected stag-
gered him with recovery he professed ignor-
ance assuming his usual arrogant confidence and
aloofness the supercilious smile curled his lips
as he regarded me as one would a worm

  professor climm murdered i know nothing
about it i didnt even know that he was dead

  i looked straight into the cold gray eyes of the
machine man the living counterpart of my old
friend and hurled another accusation at him

  you killed burton too you disintegrated his
body-and his clothes-all except the buttons on
his laboratory jacket i found them i heard
burton scream you fiend

  my voice rose in indignant wrath hulans
deathly white face grew whiter his eyes shifted
and narrowed and he glanced warily about him
with a merciless sneer of contempt he reached
forth a steel arm and clutched me with strong
metal fingers

  you ignorant clod youve learned a bit too
much you took the woman i wanted now
die

  i struggled to escape but held me like a vise
one arm of the demon closed about me and i
thought he was going to crush in my ribs i
really believe it was his initial intention but sud-
denly he relaxed his grip

  ill rid myself of you like i did burton he
hissed yes i killed him-climm too i
killed climm without moving a foot out of my
laboratory a white light through the fourth
dimension into climms room and his bones
turned to water

  with a frantic gasp i breathed air into the
tortured lungs which nez hulans steel arm had
constricted

  theyll be looking for you next his voice
clicked youll go out in a flash of atoms like
burton did then ill kill zelna-slow-very
slow

  i am a fairly heavy man but it was mere
childs play for the machine man to lift me far
above his head in one steel hand the fingers
bit into my flesh hulan carried me to a corner
of the laboratory where a large cylinder stood
mounted one end pointing at a window the win-
dow from which i had seen the bright flash
emanate the cylinder resembled the barrel of
an archaic cannon

  with one hand the human robot lifted the
top part of the cylinder it swung aside reveal-
ing a hollow interior hulan lowered my body
down into the cylinder and attempted to close
the door on me

i fought desperately the ferociousness of
my attack forced hulan backward he stum-
bled tripped and fell i seized my opportunity
and sprang from the disintegrator gun to es-
cape the doom of a horrid death swiftly i
the asteroid of death	

eluded the clutching fingers of nez hulan with
a snarl he was after me

  turning quickly i smashed my fist into that
dead white face just below the aluminum fore-
head down he went coming to his feet once
more hulan was after me again relentlessly
realizing the futility of combat against the me-
chanical arms i retreated a weird light shone
in the narrowed eyes of nez hulan death cold
and calculating faced me i circled the labora-
tory keeping out of his reach rapidly i evolved
and discarded wild plans of action there were
no weapons in the laboratory and hulan jvas
careful to keep between me and the closed door

  picking up a heavy piece of apparatus i
hurled it at him with all my might he dodged
but soon enough the object struck him upon
his shining aluminum head crushing one of his
radiophone ears this failed to stop him the
blow caused him pain however for he cursed me
in the vilest language imaginable

  he backed me in behind a laboratory table i
was cornered there on the shelf behind me
were many bottles i recognized the contents of
one receptacle and decided to gamble everything
on one desperate chance seizing the bottle i
dashed it to the floor before the feet of the human
robot a stifling white cloud enveloped him
while he groped about in its midst unseeing i
raced to the door

  but i never opened it nez leaped out of the
cloudy gas and pulled down on a lever across
the doorway there spread a close set arrange-
ment of violet shafts of light i knew better
than to run through it recognizing the disinte-
grating qualities of the atomic ray nez was
after me in an instant i turned in my tracks
but he was too quick

  with a rush he forced me backward upon a
square metal plate set in the floor nez hulan
careful to avoid contact with the plate pulled on
a cord which dangled above my head a paralyz-
ing ray of blue light shone down upon me

  too late for the atom gun nowl he rasped
this will hold you for a moment he seemed
undecided as to his further action and then he
walked over to a giant tube set vertically against
the wall he released a small lever at the bot-
tom and a red liquid filled the tube

  stay there he rasped when the liquid
rises and runs over the top of the glass the en-
tire laboratory will be blown to bits-you along
with it

  i struggled desperately but not a muscle of
my body responded my breath came heavily
fascinated i watched the red liquid rise in the
giant tube	

  now ill get zelna he shouted fanatically
shutting off the deadly rays in the doorway
ive saved something special for her

  again i made a superhuman effort to leave the
metal plate underneath the blue light the at-
tempt was useless nez ran out the doorway
heading for zelnas dormitory on the floor
above i heard the sound of running footsteps
the muffled voices of students and instructors
i opened my mouth to yell a hoarse whisper
was the best i could do the red liquid was al-

ready halfway up the length of the tube climb-
ing gradually higher to my ears came a faint
muffled scream

  reene help re-

  it was zelna madly i tried to free myself
from the damnable clutch of the metal plate and
the ray down through the corridor and past
the door ran nez hulan he was carrying zel-
na and seemedto be in a hurry my body sagged
outward in my sagging body i recognized a
lone chance

  the liquid was nearing the top of the open
tube i struck the metal plate with my arms
just outside the aura of blue light seizing hold
of a metal stanchion i dragged myself free of
the paralyzing ray and sprang to my feet the
liquid bubbled over the tube and commenced run-
ning down the outside

  with a shatter of glass i leaped through the
nearest window to the ground fifty feet below
while still in the air i heard a vibrant explosion
behind me several objects hurtled through the
laboratory window as the building rocked to the
terrific detonation i was a bit shaken up when
i landed but i was saved injury by mars lesser
gravity

  across the lawn ahead of me i saw nez hu-
lan racing in long strides carrying my beloved
zelna straight for the space ship hangars he
ran before i could reach the hangar into which
he carried zelna he had boarded a large space
liner and set it into motion like a comet the
huge space ship shot skyward heading into
space

pursuit in space

swiftly i boarded a small space flier and
was off in pursuit almost simultaneously
a ship from the fomar port of the interplane-
tary guard took after the liner the latter
craft was not scheduled to leave mars on such
short notice i recognized the pursuing n-
commanded by captain jan prentice side by
side we raced after the stolen space ship in
which nez hulan was carrying off my zelna

  nez had made a mistake in his otherwise
faultless plans or so i led myself to believe at
the time the space liner lacked the speed of
our smaller ships rapidly we overtook him
prentice and i radioed back and forth keeping
an eye on our indicators to watch our approach
to the stolen liner

  hes heading for deimos exclaimed pren-
tice

  i looked ahead of me a small round blot of
dull red among the scintillating stars grew
broader

  theres no refuge for him there i yelled

  maybe not but hes heading that way

  i now consulted by detector and indicators
we were close behind hulan like meteors the
three space craft shot toward the little moon of
mars my detector commenced acting queerly
one of the little needles swerved suddenly to
one side

the man-beast of toree



 it is now two years since the world was mysti-
 fied by the appearance of that strange crea-
 ture called by the newspapers the man
 animal the document now made public tells
 for the first time the terrible life story of this
 unfortunate being

   in the early summer of
 a texas farmer hunt-
ing some straying cattle was
startled by the sight of a
completely nude man run-
ning toward him from be-
hind a small hill the tex-
an stopped his automobile
and the man with a queer
throaty cry flung himself to
the ground in a suppliant
posture

   to his finders questions
 the man could give no co-
 herent answer he mum-
 bled unintelligibly with a
 few words that sounded like
 earth tom and
 home and so forth recur-
 ring several times he ap-
 peared to be utterly harm-
 less in fact timid

i

   after some ef-
 fort the farmer in-
 duced the creature
 to get into the car
 and they drove to
 the ranch house
 some distance aw
 some distance
 away food was
 placed before the
 stranger which he
 ate greedily like
 an animal gob-
 bling it directly in-
 to his mouth from
 the dish having
 eaten he walked to
 a comer of the
 room and curling
 up on the floor

 promptly went to
 sleep

   the man was not
 only devoid of
 clothing but his
 skin was complete-
 ly hairless except
 for his head and
 his eyelashes he
 was deeply tanned
 as though he had
 been exposed to
 the rays of a warm sun for many years but was
 evidently of caucasian origin he was slightly
 over six feet in height and of remarkably fine
 physique with smooth muscular development de-
 noting unusual stamina

   in the mans nose was a metal ring hanging
 from the fleshy ridge between the nostrils it
 must have been there a long time as there was

ralph t jones

 t is rare that we find a story that grips one
 so painfully with its realism as the present
 opus it not only strips away from us much
 of our feelings of superiority but gives us an in-
 sight into life had the course of mans evolution
 been different

    we know that it may have been only a series
 of accidents that brought man to supremacy on
 earth his thumb for example that permits him
 to work with tools and pick up and handle ob-
 jects deftly may have been a vital factor in rais-
 ing him above the level of the beast the discov-
 ery of fire may have been only an accident that
 would have come only to an animal using his
 hands as man does

    it is quite possible that on another world the
 process of evolution may be quite different and
 some alien species may have risen to supremacy
 if man exists on that world and were the thumb-
 less for example he might be no better than a
 lowly beast of the fields

    this story deals with the problem outlined and
 though much of it may seem horrible to contem-
 plate yet by its marvelous descriptions it teaches
 a lesson that strikes deep down into everyone of
 us

 no sign of a recent wound where the metal pierc-
 ed the flesh both his thumbs were missing
 amputated at the second joint where scare
 should have shown the skin was perfectly smooth
 with no trace of an operation remaining

   one peculiarity noted by all who saw the crea-
           ture was the beautiful con-
           dition of his skin it was of
           a deep tan color and thicker
           and stronger than usual it
           was as said entirely devoid
           of hair and had a strange
           polished sheen the hair of
           his head was long and was
           twisted into a short thick
           plait that hung almost to his
           shoulders

          needless to say the man
animal was a nine-day sen-
sation in the press of the
world scientists admitted
they could not account for
his condition the man was
unable to make himself un-
derstood though he tried
hard enough to talk intelli-
gibly he pointed many
times to the stars and some
reporter wrote a
story to show he
must be a visitor
from another
world such a
theory however
was so far-fetched
and inconceivable
even for the ad-
vanced thinkers
and scientists of
our day that little
credence was plac-
ed in it save by the
imaginative rom-
ancers

  finally public
interest died away

   as chief alienist
for a large institu-
tion for the mental-
ly diseased i had
been intensely in-
terested in the case
and when i offered
to keep the man
animal at my san-
itarium the proper
officials gladly con-
sented i expect
they welcomed the
suggestion inas-
much as the man had a disconcerting habit of dis-
carding the clothes put upon him and appearing
completely nude irrespective of time or place
also his lack of thumbs made it impossible for
him to perform necessary personal services for
himself and it was more trouble and expense
than anyone else wished to assume to provide
personal attendants for the creature
	wonder stories quarterly

after installing him in comfortable quar-
ters in my hospital i decided to discover if
possible the history of my strange patient
with careful treatment and much patience i be-
lieve i have partially succeeded we have used
the recently perfected hypnosis method turning
the patients mind back by the power of sugges-
tion to earlier periods of his life i must admit
however that the treatment has not been entire-
ly successful in this case we have restored the
power of coherent speech and the patients mem-
ory seems to function perfectly over the later
period of his life but of his origin his child-
hood and his early youth we have learned prac-
tically nothing

  his memory seems to stop at the time of the
kidnapping which inaugurated that astonishing
experience through which he passed-an experi-
ence so terrible it is entirely possible the senses
have been blunted by suffering and fear the
apparent paralysis of memory for events prior
to the kidnapping may be directly due to shock
i must admit too that even had we been able
to identify him fully we probably would not have
made our discovery public for some parts of
his experience are so shocking that it would seem
the part of kindliness to let his family if he has
any continue to think him dead

  i should say that the events herein recorded
cover a period of about ten earth years our
patient declares that as closely as he can esti-
mate the divisions of time into days and seasons
on the world where he spent so dreadful a por-
tion of his life are approximately the same as on
earth he admits however that he lost practi-
cally all conception of time during the long per-
iods of his monotonous existence and the elapsed
times he refers to in his story are mere guesses

  it should also be remembered that time after
all is relative it is possible that measured by
earthly standards his life on toree as he calls
the place covers either much more than ten yeara
or much less

  the story here told is to all intents just as it
came from the lips of tomman that is the
name he gives himself with the invaluable aid
of my friend and associate dr fischer the story
has been transcribed as he told it with no change
except the necessary clothing of the facts in eas-
ily understood language the thumbless hands
of course prevent tomman from writing while
his ability to read is as yet rudimentary

  before relating the actual story of tomman i
would like to say i am convinced it is true i
say this with full realization that it will probably
be disbelieved by scientists generally yet hav-
ing heard it from the lips of the man himself-at
first in halting phrases and then more easily as
the tongue long unused to english regained
some of its fluency-i cannot doubt the main
facts of the story if it is not true if it is a piece
of fiction or the product of a disordered brain
how account for the condition of tomman when
he was found two years ago why should he in-
vent such a story with all its ramifications and
all its verifying detail

  i must also remind all who read that there is
no physical reason why there should not be

somewhere in the universe planets where man
as we know him is not the dominant creation
evolution of man to the overlordship of earth
instead of some other of the myriad forms of
life seems to have been nothing but an accident
after all on some other world the accident may
have assisted an entirely different form of living
being to supremacy

  if the story that follows is not true what other
explanation can be given for the mental and phy-
sical condition of tomman the man animal
when he was discovered on that texas prairie

chapter i

the coming of the creatures

i remember the day was warm and sunny
i was lying on green grass on the top of a
small hill no one was with me and i think i
had been on a holiday or pleasure trip of some
kind

  i must have fallen asleep in the sunshine for
suddenly i awoke when i tried to move i
felt a cord around my ankles tying my feet to-
gether as i struggled to lift myself to a sit-
ting posture another rope suddenly tightened
around my body pulling me backward i was
trussed so effectively i was entirely helpless i
turned my head and saw for the first time a
group of those creatures in whose power i was
doomed to pass so many years a surge of hope-
less terror swept over me as i stared at the
things my emotion was instinctive and i think
any human being would experience the same
sensation of fright and utter helplessness on first
seeing my captors

  they were not men though they stood up-
right upon two legs they were short the tall-
est barely three feet in height and the average
several inches less their bodies were slender
with legs and arras disproportionately long
though as i soon discovered they possessed sur-
prising strength their heads were large two
or three times the proper size for their bodies
according to human standards they seemed
to lack necks entirely

  their movements were slow and deliberate
their walk was clumsy the thin crooked legs
striding in long uncertain steps for short
movements they had a habit of hopping and
were thus able to jump easily for a distance of
six or eight feet or to heights of four or five feet
i dont think they were able to run at all at
least i never saw one move faster than that un-
even walk or the hops by which they negotiated
lesser distances

  it was their features however which were most
surprising and which aroused that feeling of
repulsion and fear that through all the years i
lived among them i never overcame the skin
was mottled blue and green and brown it was
quite smooth with no trace of hair on head or face
and had a wet glistening clammy appearance
the man-beast of toree	

their eyes were large and protruded from lid-
less sockets in shockingly unnatural manner as
they stared at me i found myself unable to look
into their eyes some superior power seemed
to emanate from those great orbs and involun-
tarily i turned my glance aside

  the things had no noses small openings on
either side of the wide mouths apparently served
as the organ for breathing

  it was the mouths however that were most
horrible large they almost bisected the lower
half of the head they had thin bloodless lips
and long rows of tiny sharp-pointed teeth like
the serrated edge of a bony saw rather than the
separated teeth of men when they opened their
mouths they revealed a mass of hateful dough-
colored flesh i had the feeling that food would
be sucked down the narrow throats and absorbed
in the noisome gullets instead of being swallowed
in human fashion

  the closest comparison i can make with any
earthly creature is the frog if you can imagine
slender frogs a little less than three feet high
walking upright and with large pop-eyed heads
protruding above tunic-like garments you can
most nearly imagine the things i saw for the first
time when i awoke that day so long ago

  i spoke to the things but they paid no atten-
tion to my voice i shouted and finally scream-
ed in terror as they lifted me from the ground
i was no longer trying to reach their indifferent
ears but was yelling desperately for help to
whoever might be within sound of my voice but
no help came and i was borne rapidly downhill
i was bound so tightly i could not resist and they
paid no piore attention to my cries than we would
to the screams of a wild rabbit caught in a trap

  at the foot of the hill beside a little clump of
woods they carried me to a strange vehicle it
had a form of fuselage completely enclosed and
i saw no wings nor motor but i had no time to
notice details i was pushed inside and laid
still bound upon the metallic floor at the rear of
the craft the frog things entered after me
closed and sealed the door and i felt the machine
rise smoothly upward i was starting on an ad-
venture surely stranger than any man had exper-
enced before in the power of beings that might
be friendly or might be foes to all things earthly

as i felt the speed of the air vessel rapidly ac-
celerate i tried to compose my thoughts i
tried to regard my position as one which many
men might envy i was certainly enjoying if
that be the word a unique experience i sought
to steady my whirling brain and prepare myself
to accept quietly and resignedly whatever might
be the outcome

  i have a recollection of the passage of a long
time before i felt the land the creatures be-
came intensely active in their slow deliberate
way our ship seemed to be anchored to some
solid body outside and i saw a double door open-
ed i was again lifted and carried into what was
evidently a much larger vessel later i learned
it was a space ship capable of cruising at ter-
rific speed through the tremendous distances of
space to the world of toree that is what they

call their planet i never knew it by any other
name and cannot identify it by its earthly name

  i was carried down a corridor and pushed into
a small dark room there was neither window
nor furnishings and only the one small door i
was unbound my captors withdrew and i was
left alone

  as my eyes grew accustomed to the dim light
and my cramped limbs regained their powers i
examined my prison the door was tightly fas-
tened from the outside the room was about
eight feet long and four wide and my head came
within three inches of the ceiling the walls and
roof were of metal i tried to scratch the sur-
face with my pocketknife but could make no
impression upon it there was a space about
two inches wide between the top of the walls
and the roof and through this opening fresh air
and a faint light came across one end of the
cell was a sort of shelf or trough of the same
hard metal as the walls it was empty

  on the floor was a pile of some kind of dried
moss though it was unlike anything i had seen
on earth i decided i might as well be as com-
fortable as circumstances permitted and lay down
upon this stuff

  outside my cell in the space ship i could hear
sounds of activity there was the hum of pow-
erful machinery and a slight throbbing through
the floor in a little while there was a violent
rocking to and fro which soon settled into a
steadyswing like that of a great ship at sea
finally this passed away and i could feel no mo-
tion save the constant slight tremor

  after what seemed like hours the door to the
cell opened and two of the frog things peered in
i half rose tempted to try to escape but again
as i looked into their eyes that feeling of fright
and helplessness seized me one of them had
what i took to b a weapon in its paw or hand
it was a small tubelike affair and as i moved he
pointed it at me

  i subsided quietly and the other entered and
dumped a quantity of a dry material into the
trough out of a small sack he carried a metal
dish of water was placed on the floor near my
head and the things withdrew i heard the
fastening click into place as the door closed

  i was thirsty and drank some of the water la-
ter i examined the stuff in the trough i was
not unlike dark colored broken scraps of breacf
tentatively i nibbled at a small piece i had a
pleasant appetizing flavor and deciding it could
not be harmful i discovered i was hungry and
ate with relish

save for periodic visits to replenish the food
and water i was left alone for a long time
i think it must have been at least twenty-four
hours at last however a change came my
door opened and half a dozen of the creatures
entered two of them seized my legs and though
i offered a brief futile resistance they quickly
hobbled my ankles so that i could step only
about six inches at a stride my hands were tied
behind me and with pushes and proddings they
signified i was to step out of my narrow prison
i was directed down several long corridors and
	wonder stories quarterly

at last they roughly pushed me into another room

  this was a far different place from the cell i
had just left great glass retorts and intricate
machinery lined the walls in the center there
was a low table less than two feet high one
of the things who appeared to be in charge sig-
nified that i was to lie down on this bench
dreading unimaginable things i hobbled over
and lay down

at a signal from the leader the things untied
me and cut away my clothing they strip-
ped me completely naked and for a few minutes
examined my body with evident interest they
punched my sides and legs and pinched my
flesh one pulled my mouth open with his cold
paws and felt my teeth they seemed particu-
larly interested in my thumbs and as they paw-
ed and pulled them they carried on a low gut-
tural conversation in their own tongue

  the leader spoke and the others hopped back
he approached me and began an examination of
my body that overlooked not an inch i cannot
describe the many instruments he used but one
i recall was a sort of x-ray with which he ex-
amined me inside aa well as out he took blood
samples and pried beneath my finger- and toe-
nails he prodded and thumped me and all the
time he talked in that croaking voice with the
others in the room

  two of them wheeled up a complicated piece
of machinery a metal pad was clamped tight-
ly at the base of my skull just above the back
of my neck another was fixed against my spine
below the shoulders and still another pressed
against the extreme lower tip of my spine there
was a soft humming noise a shock like the
sudden impinging of a mild charge of electricity
passed through my body and then everything
went dark

  when i regained my senses the frog things had
all left the room except one when  moyed he
came close to the table where i lay he spoke
and to my utter astonishment i could under-
stand it was still that hoarse croaking sound
but the word he used was unmistakably meant
for hello

chapter ii

an explanation

it was ome little time before i answered the
thing beside me where i lay on that low table
surprise and fear held me speechless

  dont move it croaked drink this he
passed me a vessel containing a dark fluid and i
felt a warm revivifying glow spread over me as i
drank

  at last i forced myself to speak

  who are you where am i what does it
all mean the questions tumbled haltingly
from my lips

  i am soran he croaked i am a scientist
of toree you are on a space ship being taken
to our world

  where is toree i asked

 a orm of the fluoroscope-fct

  it is far distant from your world he replied
i do not know how you would name it

  i thought slowly my mind was confused and
i could not realize the full import of my situation
at first then a slow anger grew within me
what right had these animated horrors these
intelligent freaks to treat me as they had with-
out consulting me first why had they seized
me like some laboratory specimen and hurried
me away from everything i knew without so
much as a by your leave  when i spoke again
to the thing that stood regarding me with great
serious eyes it was anger that prompted my
words

  why have you done this thing to me i de-
manded take me back to earth you have no
right to make me prisoner i dont want to go
to your toree as you call it

  i raved in like manner for several minutes and
all the time that thing stood and gazed at me
with his unblinking eyes gradually the futil-
ity of my outburst became apparent even to my
irate mind that old sensation of helplessness
and fear crept back and my voice sank to a
whisper and finally stopped altogether in the
middle of a sentence then i think i whimper-
ed a little

  i knew as i stared at the utterly unmoved
creature that i was irrevocably in the power of
the things held not only by my physical bonds
and by my hopeless situation but held even more
helpless by the sense of mental servitude and in-
feriority that seized my very spirit whenever
they were near

  that sort of thing will do no good the thing
said after i had ceased my tirade in a hopeless
whimper we wanted you and we took you
it is not our fault you are unable to resist

  again there was silence in the room for a min-
ute or two when i spoke again it was quietly
with utter hopeless resignation to my fate i
asked the thing how he was able to speak and to
understand english he told me that through an
invention of his people he had read my mind
absorbed all the knowledge in my brain by
means of that strange instrument they had fast-
ened to my head and spine i found there was
nothing i could tell him he did not already know
but there was much i wanted to ask and pa-
tiently he answered my questions

  his race-imbos they are called-are the
dominant beings on toree they are as evidenc-
ed by the strange instruments in the laboratory
and by the space ship itself far in advance of
man in science and invention they are evolved
from amphibians similar to the frogs of earth
with which i had mentally compared them

  the space ship had made a voyage of explor-
ation to several planets i think it must have pos-
sessed the power of invisibility for soran said
it had remained hidden throughout their stay
on earth though i gathered they had conducted
quite extensive scientific investigations of our
world

  he intimated that one of the chief objects of
their interstellar voyage was to discover a rare
metal which the toreans value highly they had
found none of this metal on earth though they
the man-beast of toree	

had come across some small deposits on one of
the other planets they had visited now they
were returning to their home on toree

  at length i asked a question that had been
lurking in the back of my mind all through the
conversation

  are there men like me on toree

  he hesitated before replying

  yes he said at last there are creatures
like you on toree though we dont call them
men they are thuts

  he seemed reluctant to go on but under the
urging of my curiosity he told me something of
the condition of the humans or thuts on toree

  they had not developed mentally in pace with
the imbos physically he described them as al-
most perfect though he said they were some-
what smaller than men on earth they were not
intelligent beings at all he told me and were
classed simply as animals he said they were
kept mostly in a form of slavery to the imbos
though he did not go into detail

it was only later i learned by painful exper-
ience how abject this slavery is and how ani-
mal-like are the lives of those poor humans of
that distant world

  strangely enough it never occurred to me while
soran talked that on toree i would myself be
considered nothing but an animal

  then he began talking about the imbos again
he described their society their economic condi-
tions there was a strange similarity to that of
civilized men on earth he told me that most
of the imbos passed their lives in a keen com-
petitive struggle for wealth though they have
advanced far beyond mankind in their science
and the material comforts of their civilization
they are still burdened with a cumbersome eco-
nomic system under which some gain great
weath and other have little more than the bare
necessities of life

  power he said was in the hands of the weal-
thy and he seemed to consider this unfortunate

  there is an imbo he said named bokal
one of the richest of our race it was he who
arranged and financed this journey through
space he wanted to add to his wealth by dis-
covering more of our precious metals also i
believe to add to his fame among his fellows of
course it was necessary that he employ many
inventors and scientists to perfect the space ship
and to solve the many problems involved in the
undertaking

  that is why i am here there are others on
the ship who are among the greatest of torean
inventors engineers and scientific experts but
it is bokal and his crude kind who really control
the ship its journey and all that we do they
have little consideration for science unless it can
add to their wealth or can provide for their
amusement

  is bokal on the ship i asked

  no he said but we are all under his orders
and must obey his officers again he paused
ttien looking queerly at me he said

  bokal owns a great many thuts some of
them he keeps because they are fast runners

races between thuts are a popular amusement
on toree bokal thought that on one of the other
planets there might be thuts of sturdier or
faster build than those of toree he ordered his
officers on this ship to capture one of these
stronger thuts if they saw any and bring it to
him he hoped it would be faster than the tor-
ean thuts and thus win races for him you hap-
pen to be the one kidnaped for that purpose
when the full import of his words penetrated
to my mind i turned a horrified gaze upon the
calm soran

  but i stammered im not a thut not an
animal im an intelligent being a man they
cant do this to me

  i could see no sympathy in the eyes of sora

  i think as a scientist he said youd be
worth more to us if bokal would give you to me
for study and experiment but he wont not at
present anyway its no use your struggling
you may be what you call a man on earth but
on toree youre a thut really if you can run
bokal and his keepers will treat you quite well

a fast thut is a valuable piece of property
then he opened the door and a number of the
other imbos entered

  the last thing he said to me was i see man
your earth name is tom ill tell your new own-
ers to call you tomman

when soran turned away the other imbos
engaged in a long conversation as they
croaked their queer language i lay in my ut-
ter nudity nothing but a piece of animated flesh
as impersonal an object to them as any horse or
steer to us

  at last they seemed to decide upon a course
of action they grasped my limbs and with
strong straps fastened me to the table then
one stood over me and as fear clutched me and
cold sweat stood out upon my face i saw he held
a thin bright-bladed knife in one paw while
others held my right hand he quickly carved
away my thumb my cries of pain they ignored

  after the thumb was amputated they dipped
the bleeding wound in some strange liquid there
was an intolerable stinging for a few minutes but
when my hand was lifted out of the metal dish
the bleeding had stopped and a coating of fresh
skin appeared to have already covered the
wound

  the way in which they ignored my cries any
protests was as though they had not heard them
later i decided that imbo ears usually are not
attuned to the tones of human voices in all my
life among them soran was the only one who ever
acted as though he heard me speak possibly
he had used some artificial aid or perhaps he
could read my thoughts independently of what
my lips said i realized during my life as a
thut the true meaning of that early expression
dumb animal

  my left thumb was amputated like the right
and then they forced a hole through my nose
through the fleshy span between the nostrils
they treated these wounds with more of the mag-
ical healing fluid and then left me alone in
about an hour they returned and examined my
	wonder stories quarterly

hands and nose the wounds were completely
healed and from that day to this it has been as
though i had never had thumbs and the hole be-
tween my nostrils had always been there

  they forced a thin metal rod through my nose
and joined the ends forming a circle of the pol-
ished steel-like metal a light strong chain was
fastened to this nose ring i was unstrapped from
the table and though my limbs trembled and i
felt almost too weak to walk i was led back
through the corridors to my prison cell when
i hung back they brutally jerked the chain of
the nose ring and i could do nothing but stumble
along

  then followed days of deadly monotony and
mental anguish i had nothing whatever to do
save stand or lie in that restricted space sleep
as i could and spend my waking hours in fruit-
less thought the chain from that hated ring
passed through a small hole near the floor of my
cell and was fastened outside there was suf-
ficient play to allow me to stand or lie down but
little more i suppose i could have twisted the
chain around my neck until i died

  but i lacked the courage to kill myself and
besides i was possessed of an intense curiosity
about the strange world to which i was being hur-
ried i knew i faced inevitably painful experi-
ences but they were experiences such as earthly
man had never dreamed of before had i known
all i was to pass through i think i would have
killed myself immediately

  a factor that partially accounts for my resig-
nation to my strange fate was my physical con-
dition though denied all exercise and kept un-
der circumstances that would be expected to be
fatal to a normal civilized man there was a steady
improvement in my general health and physique
always strong and athletic i rapidly gained a
high degree of physical perfection for the first
few days the imbos each time they brought my
food injected a liquid into my veins whatever
this was it gave me an intense desire for food
i had such hunger that i quickly forgot each time
i saw my trough replenished the half-formed
resolution to starve myself to death

  daily one of the imbos spent an hour or more
massaging my legs and giving me other bodily
treatments he woul drub and knead and pinch
the muscles and i could feed new strength grow-
ing in my thighs and calves my arms he ignor-
ed seeming quite unconcerned about them he
used early in my life as an animal a paste that
rubbed over my body removed every vestige of
hair leaving the skin smooth and shining daily
he polished me all over using soft rags and an
ointment with a rather pleasant pungent odor
the hair of my head he treated with a heavy
grease and as it grew longer worked it into a
short plait that hung on the nape of my neck

  whatever it was they fed me injected into my
veins and did to me in other ways must have
cleared my body of all earthly ills as the days
passed i felt a constantly increasing flow of glow-
ing throbbing health filling my body the im-
bos have far greater knowledge of health and
food values and the physical being than we of
earth despite my forced inactivity and from

earthly standards unnatural mode of life i en-
joyed finer health i believe than any earthly
man has ever known i was physically approach-
ing that state of perfection man has always
sought but never attained

  save for the feeding and massaging and other
attentions- grooming is the proper word-i
passed apparently endless days of frightful lone-
liness the ghastly monotony of the life near-
ly drove me insane but i forced my brain into a
sort of dull apathy i taught myself in some de-
gree at least not to think only by this forced
inactivity of mind could the endless days be made
endurable

  i grew accustomed to my nudity it was the
natural thing to the imbos for a thut to be nak-
ed and i felt no more embarassment before them
though they wore clothes themselves than i
would before a dog or any other creature of dif-
ferent race they regarded me as a dumb brute
and if this was my fate a dumb brute i resolved
to be

  so the long days pasesd regularly i was fed
and watered and groomed regularly my cell
-or stable-was cleaned out and fresh dry moss
thrown in in everything save size and form
i was as a horse the property of those who fed
and kept me and if they willed could beat me or
kill me

chapter iii

thopus

by the stopping of the machinery i knew
when the space ship reached toree shortly
afterwards a group of strange imbos entered my
cell and by the attitude of deference with which
the others treated him i guessed that one must
be bokal my owner he hopped to my side and
felt my muscles he punched my stomach and
ran his paw high up inside my legs clutching
the sinews and rubbing the skin i remember
in my early days as a thut that always when an
imbo would feel my limbs and body i would be
seized with nervous trembling but gradually i
became used to the trick until i accepted it as a
matter of course

  then i was taken out of the cell through the
long corridors and through big doors into the
open as the bright sunlight struck my eyes
long accustomed to the gloom of the space ship
i turned around an imbo stood behind me with
a short pliant whip or quirt in its paw for
the first time i had felt the lash as i turned he
struck again a succession of cutting cruel blows
and for a moment i tensed my muscles to fight
the imbo holding the chain gave it a sharp jerk
and the nose ring pulled my head around to the
front smothering my anger under the realiza-
tion that resistance could only bring more pun-
ishment i stepped quietly outside with my fan-
tastic masters

  i was led across a wide open space hundreds
of imbos gazed curiously as i passed i was
pushed into a closed vanlike vehicle which im-
mediately moved away at rapid speed when
the vehicle stopped and i was pulled out i saw
the man-beast of toree	

a long low building as i was led across the
threshold a strong odor assailed my nostrils i
did not recognise it at first but it was the smell
of humans or thuts kept as animals in a stable

  i was led into a stall about eight feet square
my chain was fastened food and water were
placed before me and i was left alone

  i could hear movement all around me i had
seen that the building contained many stalls such
as the one i occupied but i had been hurried in
too quickly to notice their occupants now i
heard the rattle of a chain in the stall to my
left the dividing wall was low less than five
feet and i looked over there naked and chain-
ed liked myself stood a woman a female thut

  the woman had her head turned away when
i first saw her she was smaller than i not over
five feet tall like me she was devoid of hair
save for the heavy short pigtail that grew from
her head she was slender and glorious in phys-
ical beauty her skin bright and shining was of
a light golden hue

  her body and legs were exquisite in their
smooth shapeliness and she stood or moved with
a grace that earthly human have never known
this beauty of form and grace of movement is
typical of the thuts though i always thought
thopus as i later learned was the name of my
neighbor more beautiful and more perfect in
every way than any other i ever saw

  she turned and looked at me so utterly un-
conscious of shame at her nakedness were the
eyes that stared curiously into mine that i soon
overcame my own tendency to look away and for
a long minute or more we stared at each other
her head was well shaped though there were
minor peculiarities compared to earthly stand-
ards in her features the eyes were large of a
soft liquid brown and the nose stood out from
the face giving it a sharp pointed effect her
mouth was large with full lips and the chin was
well formed her hair which grew to a point
just above and between the eyes was drawn
tightly back into its rear knot in her nose was
the inevitable ring with the chain attached

  she gazed at me with eyes devoid of expres-
sion save for a mild curiosity i remembered
that soran had said these torean humans were
nothing but animals it was the look of a re-
signed gentle beast that gazed from my lovely
neighbors eyes yet deep in their depths i glimps-
ed a hint of intelligence

  a splendid animal she undoubtedly was her
physique would have been the despair of any wo-
man who ever walked the earth her grace
never ceased to fill me with wonder she couldnt
step across her stall without creating a poem of
motion no earthly dancer ever displayed the
beauty she showed in every move

  later i saw thuts that were gross and un-
gainly creatures but in the racing stables of
bokal all were magnificent speciments of phys-
ical perfection no other it is true was so love-
ly as thopus in form in glowing beauty of skin
or in grace of movement but i truly believe the
poorest among them surpassed in loveliness the
greek gods and goddesses of earthly myth

this gorgeous creature into whose eyes i
stared finally made sounds with her lips that
were evidently the tones of speech of course i
was unable to understand but her voice was soft
and low and musical in the long days that fol-
lowed i learned the language of the thuts with
thopus as my teacher

  their tongue is simple and one word must
serve to express many meanings but it is suf-
ficient for the interchange of simple thoughts and
i quickly learned to converse with thopus and
others i grew to know her well during the
months we lived in adjoining stalls from her
i learned nearly all i ever knew of the thuts and
their history and she was the one real friend i
had during my life on toree

  the days in the stable of bokal were insofar
as food and grooming went the same as on the
space ship there was one imbo whose duty it
was to care for me and he devoted many hours
to polishing my skin and otherwise caring for my
body my food was varied sometimes and i al-
ways ate with relish and keen appetite

  in one thing however there was a change
the day after my arrival my keeper began a per-
iod of training with daily exercise there was
a circular track outside the stable and each morn-
ing held by a long chain in my nose ring i was
made to run around it until i almost dropped
from weariness i think the gravity of toree
or the atmosphere or some other condition made
it easier for me to run than i ever could on earth
true my physical condition was superb but that
alone could not account for the ease with which
my muscles responded and the remarkable speed
i was able to achieve especially by comparison
to the deliberate hops and movements of the
imbos my running was astonishingly fast

  each day the imbo extended the length of my
running period when i hesitated and seeking
rest would slow down the sharp flick of his whip
across my legs or back urged me on at last
after weeks of this i could circle that track un-
tiringly for apparently indefinite periods

  thopus told me the thuts of bokal were the
most famous tracers on toree she could not
understand when i tried to tell her of the world
from which i came and its human beings to
her i was only another thut bigger and stronger
than others and with a strangely colored skin
such as she had never seen before most im-
portant she expected me to be faster than any
other she herself she told me had won many
races

  her mother she said had been a famous
racer before her of a father she knew noth-
ing indeed the idea of fatherhood seemed en-
tirely strange to her

  thopus said she had heard that many gener-
ations before all thuts had been wild free
things in fact she said free thuts were still
to be found in the wilder parts of toree but
she had never seen any and knew this only by
hearsay

the that language a nearly as we can understand from tomman
is a combination of simple syllables and aigns in telling the story
to us he demonstrated some of his conversation with the torean
humans of course in this story it is translated into proper eng-
lish fct
	wonder stories quarterly

  one strange thing she told me was that all
torean humans or thuts were born with only
four fingers when i told her of the thumbs
the imbos had cut from me she couldnt under-
stand and i believe thought i had been deform-
ed at birth perhaps the lack of thumbs so es-
sential to man in his use of weapons and tools
explains in part the failure of the human race
on toree to develop beyond the status of an ani-
mal

  one day as i stood talking with thopus an
imbo entered her stall and placed a set of
harness upon her i had never seen this before
and watched curiously first he fastened two
straps around her thighs a simple arrangement
was slipped over her shoulders with a belt that
buckled around her waist the whole was held
firmly in position by hooks to the thigh straps
light reins for guidance were hooked to her
nose ring and passed through other rings attach-
ed to the shoulder straps chains connected her
wrists to the thigh straps allowing freedom for
her arms to swing but preventing her raising
them above the waist

there was a small leather loop on each side
of the waistbelt and as i watched the imbo
quickly hopped to her shoulders and placed a
foot in either loop or stirrup his thin crooked
legs half encircled her body and their grip help-
ed to hold him in position his great fantastic
head rose behind and above hers in one paw
he held the nose reins and in the other he carried
the inevitable whip

  he turned her and to my surprise rode her
into my stall he hooked my nose chain to her
harness and drove us both out to the running
track then with thopus behind or beside me
the daily exercise began despite the weight of
the imbo on her back she ran strongly steadily
fast and beautifully

  a day or two later a set of harness was fitted
to me i had sense enough to submit quietly an
patiently and to allow the imbo to hop into his
place on my back i felt a pull at the nose ring
and understanding turned and walked out

  the added weight did not seem to offset the
different in gravity pull between earth and toree
at first i found it hard to run at my best with
that thing perched upon my back but i gradually
grew accustomed to it and found the best posture
in which to stand and to run i also found it
better to sink my own intelligence and allow
myself to be started stopped and guided solely
by the pulls on the nose ring and the flicks of
the whip

  thopus always advised me when my racing
days began to exert myself to the utmost to win
she said winners were more valuable to our imbo
owners and were given better treatment if
you cant win she said theyll send you away
to the oms or even to the subers a look of
terror momentarily filled her eyes as she spoke
but she wouldnt explain further apparently
finding the subject distasteful

  one morning a strange imbo came to my stall
he was smaller than most of the others i had
seen i was harnessed and led outside the

stranger mounted to my back and i felt a cruel
cut from the whip i jumped forward and the
nose ring savagely perked me back then he
walked me to the track thopus and other
thuts were waiting and they ran us in a trial
race

  i won but only after i had received the worst
lashing with that cutting relentless whip i had
yet known my rider knew no mercy he seem-
ed to think it necessary to use the whip to get
the utmost out of my flying legs

  when the race was over i stood laboring for
breath perspiration covering me and thin rivu-
lets of blood trickling from my thighs and but-
tocks where the knotted whip had cut and torn
the skin

  that night in the stable thopus told me i had
outrun the fastest of all bokals thuts and that
i would undoubtedly win many races my keeper
used lotions that miraculously healed my wounds
and he gave me an extra amount of hot food that
i ate while he massaged my tired muscles and
polished my glistening skin anew

             chapter iv
             a new life

the races were run in a huge building there
was an oval track about a quarter of a mile
around vast tiers of seats lined the track on
both sides for the imbo spectators

  a few days before we raced we were taken to
stables in the lower part of this building on
this journey i saw how great and advanced is the
civilization of the imbos we walked for miles
through a great city vehicles of all sorts darted
along the roadways and overhead i saw many
great flying machines- the buildings were of
a sort of shining stone and the architecture
though unlike anything on earth was of un-
usual beauty

  once in our stables in the basement of the rac-
ing place we were subjected to more grooming
than ever we were liberally fed and continual-
ly cleaned and polished many imbos came to
look at us and talk in that croaking tongue i
never learned to understand

  thopus again occupied the stall next to mine
and my friendship for the girl grew daily it
was not the affection of man for a woman our
life as mere animals made that impossible but
it was very real liking and i believe under hap-
pier conditions i could have loved her she was
so beautiful so gentle and kind in everything she
said i know she must be dead now but i still
dream of her and see her glorious form just as
she used to stand beside me in that stable com-
pletely unconscious of the perfect picture of fe-
male loveliness she made

  the sense of excitement that filled the tables
as the day for the first races came inevitably af-
fected all of us thuts as well as our masters and
keepers the imbos i was scrupulously groomed
for the ordeal my harness was fitted with ut-
most care and at last the rider i had carried be-
fore hopped to his place behind my shoulders
his grotesque froglike head rose above mine
the man-beast of toree	

and his long thin legs tightly gripped my body
below the armpits as we were walked out in
single file into the noise and glare of the great
track

    thopus did not run in that first race there
were ten of us including myself as they ar-
ranged us in line for the start i stared down the
track and baw the thousands of imbos who waited
for their sport to begin

  four of the nine thuts who raced with me
were women shorter than i and slender their
bodies showed perfect training and their muscu-
lar yet shapely legs promised great speed each
racer carried a rider and each was harnessed as
i i was the only one with white skin the
others were either of that golden hu like thopus
or blue or purple in varying shade i never saw
a white thut and the blue tints with less fre-
quent golden hues were the commonest colors
among them

  a remnant of shame at my nakedness swept
over me as we stood there fully exposed before
that great crowd of weird onlookers and before
each other the feeling was only momentary
and once again i realized i could be nothing but
a dumb brute among my kind

  the race was four laps around the track at
the start i ran behind most of my companions
and at the speed they maintained i feared i
could not win as the final lap began the thing
perched on my back suddenly leaned forward
throwing its weight against my shoulders the
change in balance almost threw me off my stride
for a moment but forced me to lengthen and
quicken my pace at the same time my rider
dropped the nose reins and threw his left arm
across my shoulder slapping vigorously at my
breast with his paw or hand

  in the right paw he held the whip and i felt
it descend in one stinging cruel sweep across
the rear of my straining legs from that point
on he flailed as hard as he could with the cut-
ting lash slowly i drew along side the leading
thut and when the race ended i was the winner
by several yards

  one race was typical of all the others i
never ran more than once in a day each night
my stable keeper with that magic lotion healed
the wounds the whip had made nearly always
i won though two or three times i came in sec-
ond or third

  we must have been racing this way for about
two weeks when one day they led thopus and
me out together there were no others in this
race and i think it was an important test be-
tween us thopus had been winning nearly all
her races and i think she was the fastest of all
the thuts on toree it was the only time we
raced against each other

  she was ahead of me as we neared the finish
when my rider began that terrific lashing and
urging forward her rider was treating her the
same way and i could see the whip descending
upon her legs and hips and glimpsed the red
weals where it fell and saw drops of blood spat-
tering her thighs i could have passed her but
something made me hold back and despite that

dreadful punishment from my riders whip i al-
lowed her to cross the finishing line first

that night thopus told me she knew i had
purposely allowed her to win and she said
i was foolish to do it

  it makes no difference to me she explained
and the imbos wont treat you as well if you
dont win for them

  for what i imagine was about two years we
lived without change in our circumstances rac-
ing periods came and went between times we
were kept in our own stables exercised sufficient-
ly to retain our strength and speed and cared
for with utmost watchfulness with the com-
panionship of thopus who always occupied the
stall next to mine the life was not so bad as
might be thought it was monotonous and hope-
less but physically it was glorious because of the
bounding health that pulsed through my being

  at the end of this time thopus told me one
night there was a rumor that bokal planned to
sell many of his thuts the enslaved humans
of course knew nothing of their masters affairs
but rumor was almost continuously rampant in
the stables this time it was believed that bokal
had lost much of his wealth and could not afford
to keep us all

  the rumor proved true fully half of the
stalls were empty after a day when many strange
imbos came to our stable they carefully in-
spected us and debated long among themselves
before each stall when the day ended i re-
mained still the property of bokal but thopus
and many others had been led away to new own-
ership and new surroundings i saw thopus once
again for a little while years afterwards

  another year must have passed away before
a change came in my life i had raced many
times since thopus left and was still as fast and
strong as ever but i was lonely and ad with-
out the girl beside me and i welcomed the pros-
pect of anything new in my condition it was
the young male who occupied what had been
thopus stall who first told me i had been sold

  i think they are to take you to the oms he
said i remembered how thopus had refused to
describe this place to me and tried to find out
from my neighbor what it was but he wouldnt
talk

  the following day a score of us were led from
our stable all were females except me we
were linked together by our nose chains and as
imbos mounted on other thuts wielded long
lashed whips we were driven away

  we walked for miles leaving the city behind
and passing down long rural pathways queer
trees and vegetation covered the land which was
enclosed and evidently in a state of cultivation
the road was hot and dusty and i suffered in-
tensely from thirst

  at last we turned from the main road down a
bypath enclosed fields on either side of us con-
tained many of the thuts standing idly around
or lying on the ground there is no grass on
toree but the fields are covered with that mossy
growth which dried was used for our bedding
	wonder stories quarterly

on it grew large fruity pods which i found later
were good to eat

  the thuts in the fields were all women ex-
cept for some young with their mothers they
were not so graceful as those i had seen in the
racing stables though many of them could yet
be called extremely beautiful they were not
so slender as the racers their breasts were not
so firm and round and their bodies were fleshier
and softer they had not received the same care-
ful attention and their skins though still hair-
less had lost that bright polished appearance
the plaits had been cut from the heads of many
of them and the short uneven hair gave them a
wild unkempt look

  finally we came to a group of buildings i
was led away alone to one of these while my wo-
men companions of the journey were driven
through a gateway into a nearby field

  my new stable was not as clean as the others i
had known the moss had not been changed for
many days and everything was soiled and dusty
there were a dozen stalls and in each was a
male thut they were slow lethargic men crea-
tures most of them standing or lying dumbly in
their places

  in the next stall to mine there was a heavy
gross thut fat covered his body in thick layers
and he spent most of his time lying apathetically
upon the flooring that night i spoke to him
and after a time he condescended to answer
some of my questions i asked him what the
place was and why i had been brought there

  it is the oms he said the place where
the new generations are produced we keep the
race going

then he told me many things about the oms
one of the queerest things he said which i
afterwards saw was quite true was that the
young of the thuts complete their physical
growth very rapidly they reach their maturity
in about one year of earth time i imagine it is
this fact together with their lack of thumbs
that explains the failure of the human race on
toree to develop into intelligent beings no race
could advance mentally if its individuals had no
period of youth in which to learn

  what become of all the thuts i asked
they cant keep so many for the races

  only the best and fleetest are kept for the
races he answered the others are sent to
the subers as soon as they are grown except
those they keep for breeding purposes

  what are the subers i asked again he low-
ered his voice as he replied and i could barely
understand his words

  it is where we all go at the end it is where
the imbos kill us

  i didnt understand even then

  why should they raise so many just to kill
us i asked

  why he said in surprise has no one ever
told you they kill us for our flesh which they
eat

  no earthly man can realize the sensation of
sickening horror that filled my mind after this
disclosure through days of terror and nights

of sleepless despair i thought wretchedly of my
fate i racked my brain for a means of escape
but no feasible plan suggested itself

  i think my years of complete subservience to
the imbos had sapped my will power perhaps
also those imbos have stronger mentalities than
we men of earth just as their civilization is so
much further advanced than ours whatever the
reason i could not summon the courage to at-
tempt flight

  there were also to further deter me from
thoughts of escape those terrible creatures kept
by the imbos to guard against the thuts running
away and to hunt them down in the rare event
that they did i dont think i have told of these
before they fill the roles that watchdogs and
hunting hounds fill on earth

  they belong to the cat family a little larger
than common earthly cats and wth long sharp
fangs and claws that ripped and tore when they
were allowed by their imbo masters to work
their will upon some unfortunate thut there
were many of them around the oms

  i pictured these cats hunting me in my
imagination i saw packs of them catching me
as i ran in terror and pulling me down as their
fierce teeth tore at my throat i saw excited
groups of imbos hot with the chase exultantly
urging their creatures on as i fled hopelessly
as a chased deer or rabbit flees on earth

  i dont know how many years i spent in the
breeding stables of the oms i lost track of time
i was well fed though my stable was poorly kept
i grew accustomed to the filth wallowing un-
ashamed in my bed of dirty moss and to my duty
to perpetuate the race of thuts for the imbo rac-
ing stables

  sometimes i was turned loose in a field or
moss pasture where i stood and lay idly about
eating the fruity pods i had almost forgotten
how to think and i lived as nearly the dumb
apathetic brute my masters thought me as hu-
man man could with lack of exercise my mus-
cles softened and i became fat and flabby i no
longer even dreamed of escape

chapter v
the house of death

for several weeks i was left alone in my
stable apparently forgotten except when
food and water were brought to me i was not
even taken to the fields greater quantities of
food then i had been given before were placed
before me i ate it all and as i lay and lolled
in my little stall i grew fatter i might have
guessed the fate that loomed so close but i had
almost lost the capacity for the simplest of logi-
cal thinking

  early one morning an imbo led me from the
stable into a large field where several hundred
thuts already waited they were almost all
young things barely grown though all were
heavy with fat considering their rate of growth
they could not have averaged much more than
a year in age i had found it is only the older
thuts who learn even the simple words of their
the man-beast of toree	

own language these young things could make
only meaningless animal sounds

  soon after i had entered the field i saw a dozen
large vehicles ranged along a roadway near us
one of these backed up to an opening in our
fence it was really nothing but a huge cage on
wheels an opening in the rear was let down
and with long lashed whips a dozen imbos drove
thuts inside until the cage was packed tight with
their young bodies then the entrance was clos-
ed and fastened and the vehicle moved away
while another empty took its place

  i hung back until the last of these wheeled
cages was filling then the imbos drove me in
among the thuts with pitiless blows inside we
were packed so tightly we could not lie down
we stood there hot sweating bodies pressed to-
gether like so many chickens in a coop

  the vehicles drove rapidly down many roads
for several hours it was agony to stand in that
press of naked bodies throats parched and dry
thrown this way and that as our conveyance
swayed from side to side nearly all of us were
cut by the whips or bruised by contact with each
other or the bars of our cage half a dozen of
the thuts broke their legs during the journey

  at last at one side of the road down which we
sped a large factory-like building appeared
our drivers turned in and swung around one
end

  there was an open doorway our vehicle
stopped here for some time waiting for those
ahead to unload and from where i stood i saw
a frightful thing on a sort of loading platform
was piled a heap of wet glistening objects i
did not recognize what they were for a moment
but i turned cold with dread as my staring eyes
identified them

  they were the stiff dismembered bodies of
dead men and women or thuts headless and
legless they were stacked there like the carcasses
of hogs or cattle waiting for conveyances to take
them away

  i think i fainted the truck or van backed up
to a door in a high wall and we were released
from our prison into a great yard it was a rect-
angle with the building on one side and stone
walls dorming the other three it was crowded
with thuts helpless human creatures

  i had not long to wait for the next act in our
tragedy a door in the building opened star-
ing through it i saw a place so horrible i cannot
describe the utter fear and horror that seized
me it was the slaughter house the shambles
where i was doomed so soon to die that imbos
might eat of my poor flesh

  a group of imbos descended inot the yard
among us none of the thuts resisted them
seeming to accept their approaching fate as in-
evitable the only sounds that came from their
human lips were sudden cries of fear and pain
as the imbos roughly prepared them for the
slaughter

  each thut was thrown to the ground and its
ankles tied together with short strong cords the
wrists were likewise tied the wrist cords passing
between the legs high up in the crotch i dont
believe this hobbling of legs and arms is to pre-

vent possible resistance but is merely for the
convenience of the imbo butchers

  i struggled briefly and ineffectually when my
turn came but soon found myself lying tied with
all the others i was at one side of the yard
having been among the last to enter that ante-
room of death and my back pressed against the
closed door through which we had entered from
where i lay i could see inside the building and
as i watched i witnessed the killing of nearly all
my companions

  as soon as we were tied lying helpless in that
dirty yard so close together that in some places
the poor thuts were piled two deep upon each
other i saw a sort of conveyor come out of the
doorway it ran along a rail which extended
for some distance over the yard from it hung
a hooked chain quickly the imbos placed one
of these hooks through the cords that bound a
thuts feet together the chain shortened and
the hapless thut was lifted feet first into the air

it was a young female girl that first one one
sharp cry like a smothered woman broke
from her lips as she hung head down swaying
above us the carrier quickly swung her into
the doorway

  there as i watched sick yet unable to turn
my horror fascinated gaze away a stream of
water played briefly over her body washing
away the dirt of the yard this took only an
instant and then i saw the quick ruthless last
act of a humn life on toree an imbo hopped
to the side of the hanging girl in one paw he
grasped her throat and with a thin keen blade
he severed her jugular vein with one deft stroke

  as he struck she screamed horribly her voice
dying away in a gurgling choking sob the
blood spurted from the wound and the dangling
body was conveyed away into the dark myster-
ious recesses of the building even as another vic-
tim swung under the hose and faced the dripping
blade of the butchers weapon

  in the yard imbos with hooked poles dragged
the helpless thuts into convenient position for
the dangling hooks one by one they were
swung up carried into that dread doorway and
killed there were only a few of us left per-
haps two score and one of the imbos was coming
to drag me under the hooked conveyer when
suddenly the work stopped i dont know
whether their workday had reached its end or
whether they had killed all they required for the
time the empty conveyors ran inside the door
of death closed and we were left still bound
and helpless alone

  no food or water was brought to us and we
lay in the sodden dirt of the yard so many lumps
of breathing flesh to wait through the night for
the simple transition into lifeless meat

  the cords hurt my wrists and ankles and seek-
ing relief for my cramped limbs i worked at
my bonds they were carelessly tied and it was
not difficult to free my hands then clumsily
because of my lack of thumbs i slipped the
cords from around my ankles

  even then i had no idea of escape i was
hopelessly resigned to my fate and sought only
	wonder stories quarterly

the temporary easing of my tortured limbs i
only hoped that death by the butchers knife
would not be too painful and that would be mer-
cifully quick what they did with my body
how many imbos it fed i didnt care

  it was accident that freed me from that pri-
son yard as i told i was lying with my back
to the outer door or gate which must have been
insecurely fastened as i moved i felt it give
behind me i pushed my back against it and
it gave a little more a sudden hard heave and
the fastening gave way the door swung open
and i fell a foot or more to the ground outside

  frightened i lay motionless for some time
the night was dark and i heard no unusual
sound at last nervous and tense i stood up
and stared around me before me stretched the
roadway and at its end where it turned into the
main road i could see a growth of tall strange
torean vegetation silently i ran down the road
and into the shade of the great plants

  all through the night i struggled to put as
great a distance as possible between me and that
awful place of death through dense vegetation
and across open cultivated fields i stumbled and
ran i avoided all places showing signs of habi-
tation seeking only to hide myself from the
imbos

  just as dawn was breaking i came to a stream
of considerable width i found a hollow place
beneath the bank end and with the water lap-
ping at my feet crawled under i lay hidden
there all day

  the next night i stopped the pangs of hunger
by eating from a field of podded moss and then
refreshed waded and swam across that stream
and pushed still further across the country i
was leaving the more thickly populated places
and getting into a strange wild land there
were no trees like those of earth but tall frond-
ed growths rose thickly in many places huge
bright-colored flowers three and four feet across
swayed in the wind and heavy sweet odors filled
my nostrils

  i think it was the fifth day after my escape
when i met the wild thuts there were about
twenty of them eight or ten women one man
and the rest young children i came upon them
in an open place in the forest as they fed on the
strange fruits with which the place abounded
a little pool of water glittered in the sun and
they stood and lay upon the mossy bank beside
it

  they crowded curiously around me as i ap-
proached and one of them hesitantly stretched
out its four-fingered hand and touched my nose
ring i caught enough words as they chattered
together to know they recognized me as an es-
caped captive or domesticated thut that night
i stayed with them

they were in most respects like the captive
 thuts among whom i had lived wilder
more unkempt and marked with the indepen-
dence of all free things the male told me therd
were many of them in similar groups scattered
through the forests he also told me that some-

times the imbos penetrated to their territory
and hunted them with the cat animals

  early the next morning the man thut told me
i could not stay with them it was the law of
the group that it could contain only one adult
male if i wished to fight him for leadership
of the group and possession of the women he
was quite ready for battle to the death i de-
sired none of his woman and i did not want to
fight i turned away from them back into the
forest as i looked back i saw an unmistakable
glance of scorn in the eyes of several of the
women

  i must have lived for weeks alone in the forest
i subsisted on the wild fruits and drank from
the countless streams and pools of clear cool
water each night i slept wherever i found my-
self and i was never molested as far as i could
discover there are no dangerous animals veno-
mous reptiles or insects upon toree i saw sev-
eral groups of the wild thuts at a distance but
always kept away from them the hard open
life removed the fat from my body and i regained
a large part of that physical wellbeing and bodily
strength i had known in my days as a racing
thut

  one day late in the afternoon i heard sounds
of hurrying things in the forest near me a
group of thuts running desperately dashed
across the little glade in which i stood i knew
not from what they were running but they were
evidently frantic with fear i ran after them

  behind me i could hear sounds of pursuit
after a long time as my labored lungs felt at the
point of bursting and my legs seemed unable to
sustain me any longer i came to a wide river
i plunged in and hid in a patch of water vegeta-
tion only my head above water and it well hid-
den behind the fronded leaves as i peeped
at the river bank a few feet away i saw a young
male thut racing along the water edge behind
him sped three of those cat animals and further
behind two imbos rode into view mounted on
tame thuts

  just as the fleeing man terror staring from his
eyes came opposite my hiding place one of the
cats leaped to his shoulders the man screamed
and attempted to knock the thing away with his
hands but it clung there and twisting its head
quickly round his neck ripped with long sharp
fangs at his throat he stumbled and fell in
a quivering heap not ten feet from where i
stood hidden in the water the other cats leap-
ed on him and for a minute their furry bodies
half covered the writhing twisting mass of hu-
man body arms and legs

  then the imbos rode up and drove their cats
away with guttural cries of command the
wretched mans throat was torn to shreds and his
head and shoulders were a mass of bleeding
wounds where teeth and claws had ripped and
slashed

  the imbos stood beside the body for a while
then they tied ropes to the poor dead carcass
and fastened them to their riding thuts a
throaty command and a slash from the whip and
the straining man things slowly dragged the body
the man-beast of toree

of their dead fellow away through the under-
growth

t stayed in the water for a long time long
ter it had turned dark i crept out dreading
the imbo hunters who might i thought still be
in the neighborhood i decided to try and cross
the wide river before me i struck out from the
shore and slowly swam into the unknowfa depths

  after a long while i saw the outline of the
further shore before me my feet touched bottom
and i dragged my weary body up the bank i
rested and then as dawn was breaking cautious-
ly walked away from the river seeking some
place to hide

  i had not gone far before i realized i was close
to imbo habitations i crept along the edges of
cultivated fields and passed many imbo homes
no one saw me and i pushed on hardly caring
what became of me yet seeking some hiding
place in which to pass the daylight hours

  i came at length to a large open space and
paused in the edge of the vegetation then in
the center of this space perhaps two hundred
feet from where i stood i saw something that
made me rub my eyes in astonishment

  as i gazed upon the vast bulk i recognized
the huge machine for what it was a space ship
such as the one which had brought me from earth
so long ago there were no imbos in sight and
i ran across the intervening space i didnt real-
ize quite what i was doing it was just an acci-
dent instinct or perhaps providence that led my
feet inside and down the long corridors

  i was not familiar with the interior arrange-
ment of the ship even if it was the same on which
i had travelled from earth a thing of which i
was by no mean sure yet something guided
my feet straight to a little room a cell or stall
similar to that in which i had first been forced
from civilized manhood into the condition and
status of an animal the door was open and i
stepped inside and pulled it to behind me i
fell to the hard metal floor and in a few minutes
sleep answered the demands of my worn and
weary body

	  

  the space ship was in motion when i awoke
several imbos stood in my room staring at me
where i lay i imagine their expressions denoted
astonishment according to imbo ideas none
molested me and they quickly withdrew shutting
and fastening the door as they left



  it was about an hour later when one of the
imbos returned he touched my head gently
and made signs that he meant me no harm then
i recognized him it was soran the scientist who
had first told me about toree after he had read
my mind and learned my english tongue with
the brain-reader for the second time i heard
him try in halting croaklike tones to form the
sounds of my own language i discovered that
the words after all my years of slavery were
strange to me too and if soran found it hard to
talk i found it equally difficult to make my brain
understand

  he told me that when his companions first
found me on their ship they thought some friend
had sent them an additional supply of fresh meat
for their larder they were on another expedi-
tion to the distant planets he said but this time
their objects were purely scientific they had
been able to finance their journey without ap-
pealing to bokal or his kind

  then he said he had recognized me as that
thut of earth he had seen captured on the earlier
voyage years before

  we could not guess how you got on our ship
he said but i told them you were tomman the
man of earth we all decided that your pres-
ence here was a good omen for the success of our
venture we felt that it would augur success if
we treated you as kindly and as well as possible

  we have decided to take you with us to feed
you and care for you to the best of our ability
we had not planned to visit your earth again
yet it will not be far out of our planned route
we will swing to your planet and stop long
enough to set you down upon its surface

  that is all my story on the space ship i
was still stabled and fed and cared for as an
animal but it was the finest imaginable treat-
ment a stabled creature could have i had un-
limited supplies of the best of foods clean soft
moss fresh each day and gentle careful groom-
ing

  one night i was led from my stall and placed
on board that small auxiliary air vessel in which
i had first been kidnapped we dropped from
the space ship to earth i was pushed through
the door onto that great plain where the earth
man found me the following day i saw the
imbo airship leap upward and disappear in the
dark skies i hope no earthly man may ever see
it again

based upon the  first prize
winning plot of the interplanetary plot contest

i

william thurmond
who fumlbhed the plot

first saw the ship from our forward tur-
ret window it had been observed electro-
telescopi c a  y
for an hour past but
i had no opportun-
ity to see it then
to the naked eye it
became visible - a
tiny black dot at
first so small amid
the blazing gems
strewn on the great
concave velvet of
the firmament that
one might blink and
wonder if it were a
vision then it was
a blob of formless
shape faintly illu-
mined on one side
by the dim light
from distant suns

  the interior of
our vessel clanged
with the signals to
stop our flight the
heavens swung in a
great pendulum arc
and presently we
were hovering and
the ship of doom-
as  always in my
mind i shall term it
-lay close before
us

  i recall now with
what strangely
awed emotion i
gazed through the
glassite bullseye of
that turret window

around me was the
torrent of excited
questions of my
companions the
clang of bells the
tramp of feet but
i scarcely heard it
as i stared at this
derelict we had
come upon so sud-
denly lying so silent
and alone in the
trackless infinitude

o	f interstellar
space millions up-
on millions of miles of nothingness were here be-
hind us the sun of our solar system was a mere
point of light so far distant that most of its
planets were lost in the stars with only apollo

cast a faint reflected light upon us

ray cummings
who wrote the story

 the novel and extraordinary plot-winner of the
 first prize in the interplanetary plot contest
 that underlies this story gives us a new pride in
 our readers it justifies our belief that they not
 only know what they want but they can on oc-
 casions demonstrate it by constructing an original
 science fiction theme

   we asked mr cummings to write a story based
 upon it when the story was concluded he told the
 editors that in his opinion it was his best work and
 we believe it

   the story opens anew some of the fascinating
 possibilities of time traveling we know that travel-
 ing in time may be theoretically possible there are
 many advantages to be gained unique experiences
 to be had but what are the more remote but potent
 dangers of this expedition into the unknown what
 are some of the great cosmic forces that we are not
 aware of but that are likely to step into the play and
 wreck the entire expedition some of these ques-
 tions this story answers

   to mr thurmond for furnishing the plot and
 mr cummings for writing the story we offer our
 thanks-jointly they have done a marvelous job
 they have helped to make the interplanetary plot
 contest a tremendous success



we had thought ourselves the first of humans ever
to penetrate lay the derelict ship of doom it

hung now no more
than a mile away
it seemed from this
viewpoint to resem-
ble a n old-time
space-ship of the
sort which once at-
tempted the moon
journey and failed
to do more than rise
out of the earths
atmosphere

  yet when soon
we were approach-
ing still closer i
saw that this could
be no space-ship at
all it showed it-
self to be in form
like a ball flattened
well down at its
poles so that it had
the aspect of a disc
i could not tell at
first how large it
might be but
ranee was steadily
maneuvering u 
closer to it

   i saw at last that
it was a coppery
metal disc perhaps
a hundred feet in
diameter with bulg-
ing convex bottom
and top to give an
interior height of
some thirty feet a
deck encircled its
outer rim-a nar-
row deck of what
might have been
glassite panes and
with a row of bulls-
eye windows and
in the center upon
the top of the disc a
curiously bulging
little conning tower
was bravely set

  as we drew for-
ward i saw that the
tower was a woven
mesh of wire
strands the disc seemed slowly rotating upon a
polar axis so that all its deck windows passed our
line of vision in a silent review and between two
of the bullseyes there was a small door-porte
ranee called at me

  good lord allerton see that door its part-
ly open theres no air in the damned thing
	wonder stories quarterly

no one can be on it alive

  i did not answer was anyone aead or alive
within this strange little derelict it seemed not
no face was at any of the bullseyes and what
was this little thing doing out here it was not
a space-ship even with my limited technical
knowledge i could not fail now to see that there
was no visible means by which this strange affair
could navigate space then how came it here
what human had devised it and how had he
brought it here and where was he with his
little mechanism poised here in the vast eternal
silences

  or perhaps the thing had not come from earth
at all realization of my own fatuousness rush-
ed upon me to each human mind himself is
the pivot of the universe why should i so child-
ishly assume that this little thing had come from
our tiny earth when so many other worlds were
closer

  yet it had come from earth as though to
answer the flood of my unspoken questions a
hand gripped my shoulder it was old man dor-
rance father of our present commander at sev-
enty now for all his white hair and the weight
of his years there was not a man among us more
capable of coping with the unknown it was he
who had brought us out here-he who seemingly
would never turn back if a mystery lay ahead

his hand gripped me his voice brought me
out of my thoughts

  that thing i know what it is i remember
it forty odd years ago lad-that was before your
time so this was its end 

  and as he told me i too recalled it by hear-
say years ago to an incredulous world a scien-
tist named ronald deely announced that he had
found the secret of time-traveling he had pro-
cured funds and built his little vehicle-this same
disc-like vehicle which now lay so strangely inert
before us old dorrance poured out the tale to
me now there was deely and his wife hilda-
and the commander was one gerald vane with
three other men these dabblers into the unknown
had one day entered their burnished disc for a
time-flight fifty years into the future

  ten thousand people-so old dorrance said
and he had been one of them-had breathlessly
stood and watched this disc depart the current
went into it the thing hummed the solid
burnished coppery shape grew tenuous an in-
stant and it was a wraith-the shimmering ghost
of a disc imponderable intangible-yet for a
brief instant visible then it was gone speeding
forward into time

  yet as dorrance told me now that time-travel-
ing disc was not equipped to move in space the
concrete platform where it rested to the eye of the
beholder seemed empty when it departed for
that time it was empty the disc presumably had
gone fifty years ahead-yet it should have remained
upon its platform so that in fifty years the plat-
form would again have caught up with it and
possessed it

  then why was the disc hanging out here now in

space billions of miles from the earth what trick
had nature played upon these brash scientists who
had dared to pry into her secrets

  a group of our men were around me and old dor-
rance young dorrance was saying

  no air in it did you see that door-porte
partly open-i can make contact there well
board it-

  somebody else exclaimed so its the deely
time-ship out here-by god forty years ago-

  and if any of you men want to go aboard it
with me get into your pressure suits well see
whats there-no one alive of course-this weird
thing- young dorrances voice faded as he
dashed from our turret

  wait said old dorrance but i know why its
here these young scientists-scatter-brained al-
ways rushing to do something-let them get our
suits ready

  i paused while he told me his theory meanwhile
ranees brother was assembling our pressure suits
this strange thing-yet so simple-

  the deely time-ship had gone fifty years into
the future but ronald deely coping thus with
nature had failed to make adjustments of time
with space his little ship once in the stream of
time plunging forward became wholly discon-
nected from the earth and the earth is not at
rest in space but swiftly moving how fast with
absolute motion who can say it follows our sun
which in turn is drifting-and all the stars all the
universe plunges-somewhere

  deely had either overlooked this or had been
unable to make the necessary adjustments his
ship was whirled away into the infinity of inter-
stellar space fifty years ahead of the motion of our
solar system-to wait fifty years for the arrival of
our little planet to make a space and time contact

  i listened amazed as old man dorrance ex-
plained it something undoubtedly had gone
wrong with deelys time-mechanism he had
reached his fifty-year goal but could not or at least
did not return and here was his ship with forty
odd of those fifty years now past waiting out its
predestined meeting with earth

  awesome idea yet who could doubt its ration-
ality this then was where the earth would be
in some ten years more i stared at the ship of
doom with a new amazement it seemed very
slowly rotating on its vertical exis but was it
was that not perhaps a mere visual illusion per-
haps all the great firmament with me in it was en-
dowed with that slow spin our turret instru-
ments trained now upon the little derelict and
measuring its angles with the far-distant sun of the
solar system showed that the derelict had a per-
ceptible drift in that direction

  thoughts are swift-flying things they thronged
me deelys ship lying here was drifting toward
our earth but of course why not the prox-
imity of the solar system-its total mass-was
slowly very slowly drawing the derelict toward
it that was understandable that was reconcil-
able with the known laws of celestial mechanics
the derelict of space	

              chapter ii
              the derelict

but was it was this derelict drifting back
home-or was the earth merely approaching
their predestined meeting place as i envisaged
this commingling of time and space it seemed to
me that here might be the secret of gravity itself
and as i stared at the ship of doom i saw in it
suddenly absolute rest in all this great starry
universe was this little time-ship which had tam-
pered with nature the only thing unmoving i
think so poised here for its fifty years unmov-
ing-like a pivot around which flowed the cease-
less changes of the cosmos

  perhaps that is so old man dorrance was say-
ing so many things we think we know and find
we know nothing  yes you young friend i
want my pressure suit do you think the old man
is likely to sit here doing nothing

  there were four of us who went aboard the ship
of doom our space-flyer came up to it very slow-
ly the silence and the motionlessness hung like
a spell upon it no faces at its little windows
nothing moving on its little deck no sign of life
in its little turret we could sense that death was
here

  the four of us went across the void we leaped
from our ship spinning emptiness landing gently
on the ship of doom

  got it exulted young dorrance put on
your helmets    you jake watch the valves-
dont exhaust the lock too fast

  i fastened down my goggling metal helmet to
the heavy collar and started the mechanism of the
suit the fabric bloated upon my shoulders the
small oxygen tanks and the sponge-like absorbers
of the carbon-dioxide sat like a hunchbacks lump

  through the visor pane my companions showed
as gaping monsters from some strange planet
shapeless puffed human forms  old dorrance
touched a metal finger against the metal contact
plate of my arm my audiphone tinkled and i
heard his voice in my ear

  be sure you maintain a fairly even pressure
lad keep it at about fifteen pounds

  i could see his eyes staring at me through his
visor

  right i said dont worry-ive done this
before

  we crowded into the small pressure chamber and
the inner door slid closed the valves opened
the air in the lock slowly rushed out into space
and then at last we slid aside the outer panel

  young dorrance was first to step the small yawn-
ing gap between the two ships his bloated gloved
hand seized the partly open door and drew it aside
we crowded forward with the dim starlit little deck
of the ship of doom curving before us

  what would we see wreckage carnage
there was nothing a few small metal chairs
stood neatly in a row the curving deck was four
feet wide and twice as high a nearby inner door
to the circular interior was closed nothing here

  but as i turned from this instant glance i saw
slumped here on the deck a human form a man
hunched forward with his arms wrapped around
his updrawn knees

  dead said the voice of old dorrance in my ear
dead of course these many years no air-body
marvelously preserved look at him-i remember
him brown the mechanic odd sort of fellow-
i had a talk with him once

  he sat here by the opened outer door as though
he were on guard or perhaps watching the rush
of air as it went out his attitude seemed so calm
so resigned philosophical the word hit me
this fellow here in his work-stained garments-
philosophically watching death stalk upon him

  the body fell forward to the deck as my com-
panions pulled at it like prowling ghouls he was
a man about thirty a rough-hewn good-natured
looking face now puffed up   bulging blue
eyes

  but there were others on this ship of doom not
so smiling   

  the central portion of the circular disc was di-
vided into two horizontal floors and into several
rooms on each it was a dark and silent interior of
woven metal grid-work and metal furnishings our
small torch-lights flashed their tiny white beams
around it

  the rooms were segments of a circle like a pie cut
into quarters four on the lower tier a little
circular stairway leading upward to four other
chambers and a circular ladder into the upper tow-
er on the lower tier were the mechanism and
control rooms a storeroom of food and a sort of
general lounge the sleeping rooms were upstairs
and in the tower were the observation instruments

  i gave little thought to these details it was the
dead which fascinated me   

  the inner connecting doors were all tightly
closed as though these doomed travelers had real-
ized their danger and sealed themselves in to hold
the precious air as long as possible    and we
saw them now as they had chosen to be when death
came upon them   

he chanced to enter first tho room where the
food was stored    here was evidence of
strife death had not been faced with utter calm-
ness by them all the storeroom was wrecked as
though by some desperate struggle and on the
floor lay another mans body how different from
the calmness of brown the mechanic this man
lay contorted and under our lights his head and
face showed gruesome where some heavy instru-
ment had smashed it with a murderous blow

  murdered this one-a struggle here over the
food doubtless

  four other human bodies were on the ship-all
of them were in the lounge room   

  upon a chair with a small table before him a
young man sat slumped over a note-book and pencil
as though he had been assiduously writing almost
at the last a handsome young fellow with sensi-
tive features the face of a dreamer staring
dark eyes which one could fancy looked at life al-
ways with amused wonderment above the almost
girlish face there was a shock of waving black hair
	wonder stories quarterly

  i gazed at the note-book in which he had been
writing its cover was inscribed

the chronicle of philip tkomasson

  old dorrance touched me he had more money
than was good for him prominent social family
only thing he ever did in life was finance deely
and this hilda deely was mad with passion-but
not for her husband everybody knew it-except
the husband thats hilda deely over there-look
at her

  strange contrasts thomasson sat so calmly
but across the lounge there lay the body of a man
who had not had the courage to die his hands
were tearing at his throat an agony of terror was
on his face his thick tongue protruded one could
fancy that he had met his end screaming   

  there were two others-a man and a woman
the woman was young and slim and very beautiful
with a mouth that seemed made for love and eyes
which even now in death seemed to hold love like a
torch to burn eternally

  this was hilda deely she lay on a couch wrap-
ped in a mans arms with the long tresses of her
black hair falling disheveled to envelope them both
and his arms protectingly holding her together
never to be separated death had come to these two
and upon both of them with the prospect of death
it seemed that there must have come a strange tran-
quility of spirit   

  but what had happened on this doomed little ves-
sel  what tragic scenes had been enacted of which
we now were seeing the mere final tableau  what
turgid philosophical and exalted human emotions
must have swept this half dozen humans in those
last moments of their lives

  i can try to picture it there is what we saw
on the ship to guide me and thomassons chron-
icle which with an ironical determination he
seemed to have penned in detail until almost at the
last    and there is my own fancy weaving it
together impressionistically perhaps and with lap-
ses-but weaving it nevertheless until i think that
after all it may be a fairly true pictur   

chapter iii

first moments

the moment of departure was at hand in the
lower mechanism room of the deely time-vehi-
cle brown the mechanic sat at his controls out-
side his glassite window he could see the awed and
excited crowd which had assembled to witness the
departure but brown wasnt interested in the
crowd that sort of thing meant nothing to him
this was a job he had to do the risk the dan-
ger-he was getting paid extra for that he wanted
no applause there was no reason he felt that any-
one should applaud him besides waving flags and
shouting and throwing hats in the air was childish

  brown with his stocky figure encased in a greasy
worksuit stood at his window for a moment puff-
ing at his pipe the throng was cheering gazing
up to the tower of the time-vehicle brown knew
that professor deely and his wife were up there
with gerald vane commander of this time-flight
brown though he could not see them knew that
they were smiling and bowing to the multitude he

grinned ironically to himself deely was a fatuous
ass to bring his wife in this close contact with a
man like gerald vane   

  brown shrugged and turned away it was no
concern of his for all of him the woman could
stand up there clutching rose to her breast bowing
and smiling looking like the soul of purity-and
yet have in her heart and mind nothing but dupli-
city to brown-who was a bachelor-it was of
no importance

  and at that moment hilda deely and her hus-
band were indeed in the tower answering the plau-
dite of the crowd

  hilda dear isnt it wonderful deelys arm
went around his wife he was a frail studious
looking man of forty hifr shock of prematurely
grey hair made him seem older his face always
bore the look of a man far away in spirit he was
an unworldly fellow this deely he passed by the
evil in the world without seeing it for his gaze
was always fixed on the stars

  his mind learned erudite profound was in
worldly things that of an innocent child he sought
for so many long hours each day to delve into the
mysteries of nature that the beauty of his young
wife and her love for him became things he took
for granted her inner life her desires-the my-
riad illusions upon which a woman builds romance
-all those were mysteries of nature to which
deely never gave a thought

  isnt it wonderful hilda he repeated lis-
ten to them cheering us he tightened his arms
around his wifes shoulders this is the happiest
moment of my life

  he did not notice that she involuntarily drew
away from his encircling arm gerald vane stood
close behind them darkly handsome of flashing
dark eyes bold features and strong cleft chin and
with his broad athletic shoulders so trim now in
the uniform with gold braid whatever his inner
character outwardly gerald vane was the sort of
man upon which a woman may build her dreams

  and the earnest tremblingly happy ronald deely
did not notice that his wifes free hand went behind
her so that in this moment while the crowd ap-
plauded vane gripped her hand and briefly held it
with a tender pressure while between them passed
unspoken a reassurance of their love

  well said vane were getting the publicity
deely every newscaster in the world is blaring
of this shall we make another speech for the mic-
rophones

  no no im too excited hilda dear isnt
this wonderful all these years i have worked
for this-

  then lets get started vane interrupted this
is a good dramatic time close that port

  yes well start now hilda and i will sit here
there will be a starting shock hilda dont be
afraid-ill hold you

  vane closed all the portes in effect the little
vehicle was a space ship now almost capable of
withstanding an outer vacuum

  all ready

  yes yes vane deely did not see the look
which passed between his wife and vane for
them this was a moment of crisis also a moment
of triumph hilda shrank against her husband
the derelict of space	

but to her mind it was gerald vane she was
clutching they would fling themselves out into
the future and in that world of the future she
and gerald would escape from the ship  fac-
ing the future together 

  gerald vane pulled at a lever down in the low-
er control room the phlegmatic brown calmly and
efficiently responded the little vehicle glowed and
hummed and was flung into time   

  in the lower lounge the two other men sat grip-
ping their seats against the shock of starting

  you all right thomasson

  yes i-im still here

  my god-this weird thing-where-where are
we

phil thomasson half rose out of his chair
but sank dizzily back the floor window-porte
of the lounge-room showed a grey luminous blur
the door to the little deck stood open but nothing
could be seen out there save the reflected glow of a
small deck light

  william mink repeated where-where are
we

  the pale byronic thomasson smiled just
passing through day after tomorrow i should fan-
cy

  it was romance to young phil thomasson he
knew nothing of the science of it nor cared with
his inherited money he had financed all this an
adventure freedom from the boredom of being
a too-rich young man with nothing to do in life
save dissipate wealth

  to the perspiring frightened william mink it
was an adventure also mink was a thick-set
paunchy man of fifty at forty he had thought to
conquer the financial world but now at fifty he
was a pauper his banks had failed and shattered
his mind his mentality now was far from nor-
mal though he did not know it perhaps it never
had been normal one cannot work with the ob-
session of unbounded wealth desiring nothing else
in life but money and be of normal mind

  mink was a good friend of gerald vane he had
indeed upon many occasions loaned vane money
he would have financed this deely expedition-for
the publicity which in many ways he could have
turned to financial profit-had not his fortunes
crashed and phil thomasson come forward and fin-
anced it instead

  and so mink was here as an escape from his
troubles but mink had also another idea there
were secrets in the future of the world which he
could learn secrets which when he brought them
back would speedily make him rich again

  but now he was terrified so that phil thomasson
gazed at him with a sarcastic smile

  youre not much of an adventurer are you
brace up mink weve started and were still
alive thats a triumph anyway

  thomasson climbed to his feet unsteadily jove
its weird come on out on the deck lets see what
next year looks like were omnipotent mink
little gods with clay feet   

  to gaze and see what next year looks like but
nature was to play a sudden sardonic trick to con-
found this band of necromancers so that when they
learned of it they were to gather jammed terror

stricken into the upper little tower room and even
the stolid brown was startled

   

  the realization of what the destiny of the flight
might be came to them apparently hours after the
flight had started it came with a shock but
then the thing was wholly understandable to deely
and to vane deely indeed had thought of it as a
possibility but hoped it would not come to pass
since he could see no way of changing it the
realization that finally came that while they were
whirling through time they were also hurtling
through space brought to each of them a secret
confounding their secret plans were awry the
vehicle had actmlly separated from the earth and
what they gazed at now through the turret bulls-
eyes was a luminous blurring vista of a starry
firmament all in movement

  to phil thomasson it was less of a disappoint-
ment he had thought to observe the follies of
future generations and be amused but after all it
was amusing also to see these crazy swaying stars
and it was amusing to see the baffled lustful gerald
vane and the baffled woman

  but its all right deely was trying to assure
them when the realization that they were in inter-
stellar space had finally penetrated well go in-
to the future and then turn back we cannot land
anywhere-except back on earth in what will al-
ways be the present time the experiment is a
success vane think of what an advance for
science-look at those worlds out there

  it was a blurred crazy universe endowed opti-
cally with strange motion the sun was drawing
away saturn with his brilliant ring was coming
forward   

  dont you realize my friends deely went on
vehemently were explorers into the unknown
of space and time you think were moving
were not this vehicle of ours has found abso-
lute rest

  he gazed at the bank of dials before him with
their whirring indicators

  we are in the future now this is where the
earth will be at this time which we have already
reached and we are going fifty years into the
future what realms of starry space we will see-
where the earth will be fifty years from nowl
think of it-no man has ever penetrated those
realms-

  a space trip murmured thomasson jove
we start for a time-trip and it turns out to be a
voyage among the stars thats funny

  and what a trip exclaimed deely think of
it-

  thomasson was smiling ironically i am think-
ing of it we cant gaze into the future of our
earth dont you realize man this is the al-
mightys little joke you think with your science
you can do everything but you cant the future
has always been hidden from us and it always will
be

ckt e-were in no danger then stammered

  vv mink nothing has gone wrong with your
mechanism

  of course not deely reassured excitedly my
time mechanisms are working perfectly i have
	wonder stories quarterly

conquered the secret of time when we return
think what new facts we will have to add to science
why this involves gravity itself it involves the
cause of all movement it shows that time is in-
deed the fundamental pivot upon which every-
thing swings

  well said brown if everythings all right i
better get back to work them batteries maybe
need renewin already

  he tamped out his pipe and clambered down
the ladder chief he called if mrs deely needs
any help gettin the lunch im ready any time
hungry said deely of course we all must be
hungry hilda dear you go down and start things
i must stay here and make notes

  yes yes ronald

  ill help her said vane come hilda

  in the small tower crowded with the six of them
hilda deely had found herself pressed close against
gerald vane it seemed that everyone must hear
the thumping of her heart    she and gerald
standing so close that it seemed she could feel the
rhythm of his heart against her breast every
beat of that strong heart of his was for her   

  they descended the ladder and he turned sud-
denly in the empty lounge and flung his arms
around her

  hilda

  gerald not so loud

  they cant hear us kiss me-

  brown may see us

  no and what difference he knows how to
keep his mouth shut    kiss me  he knows
hed lose his work with us    it drove me fran-
tic up there in the turret hilda the warmth of
you 

  gerald dear one  

  they snatched like this another moment of mad-
ness or ecstasy or love to hilda it was all
of those

  gerald i love you oh take me away far
away from everyone gerald-everyone but you
and so the strange journey went on a little
world of itself this deely time-vehicle hurtling
into the future and out into the uncharted realms
of interplanetary space a world of six inhabi-
tants    they went fifty years from their start-
ing point then sixty years the journey con-
sumed days of their life and then deely reversed
the mechanism retrograding through time so that
all the universe was adjusting itself and to the ob-
servers from the little tower it seemed that the
solar system now so distant was again approaching

  deelys mechanisms worked perfectly for him
it was a triumph the dials recorded the passage
of absolute time sixty years forward then the
return with what instruments he had at his com-
mand deely charted the apparent movements of
the stellar universe and his mind flung ahead
with a larger-a more powerful vehicle-the time
transition could be greatly accelerated those six-
ty years had seemed about a week to the travelers
now deely envisaged an apparatus which would
penetrate sixty hundred or sixty thousand years
while the humans on it were experiencing only a
few days

  sixty thousand years to what infinite realms
of space such a ship would reach the point where

our earth will be sixty thousand years from now
perhaps such a ship could land somewhere 

chapter iv

the discovery

but deely now with the care and the precision
of a true scientist was heading back for a land-
ing upon earth the time the voyagers had ex-
perienced would be about two weeks and deely
knew that the laws of nature-unnameable laws
but inexorable-would allow him successfully to
land at a point of time on earth that same two
weeks after his departure he would have lived
those two weeks and the earth-world would have
lived them all devised by nature into ration-
ality   

  deely was a careful man no amount of enthus-
iasm now led him to want to take unnecessary
chances two weeks was long enough for them
to chance upon this voyage they had brought
food and water for a comfortable two weeks it
had seemed wholly adequate since they had intend-
ed to land in a future time-world of earth where
supplies would be available and the batteries
too were safely adequate for no longer an opera-
tion than that

  wed better turn back deely had said to vane
dont you think so

  yes i do stick to safety-always my idea in
everything

  even in those stolen moments-safety in every-
thing for vane

  so they turned it was just after they had
passed the point at which they were still fifty years
ahead of the earth when fate dealt out to deely
in these hours of his triumph a blow terrible
crushing-and yet perhaps merciful

  gerald vane and hilda had been alone so much
during this week of the outward trip that vane-
playing always for safety-forgot his motto brown
was generally in the lower mechanism room
mink was always abstracted brooding and morose
thomasson was gay when there was anyone to
listen-or if not that he was immersed in an in-
terminable chronicle for his own amusement and
deely slept ate and worked upon his scientific data

  it left hilda and vane with many stolen mo-
ments a sweet intimacy-not yet cloying-for it
made gerald vane ever more bold   

  and then came that moment of the return flight
when deely received his crushing blow it chanced
to be in the living routine of this little world after
the evening meal one might call it nearly mid-
night deely at this time was ordinarily asleep
worn to the point of exhaustion by his mathema-
tics

  but this night he awakened hilda was not in
their sleeping room but it caused deely no second
thought for hilda often remained up after he re-
tired sitting in the lower lounge with mink and
vane deely suddenly found himself strangely
wakeful the problem on which he had been work-
ing after supper was unfinished and now the solu-
tion of it seemed ready to be found

  he slipped from his bed into slippers and outer
robe and left the small triangular room it was
the derelict of space	

glowing with the strange iridescence of the time-
current the humming which always pervaded the
interior of the disc was like music to deelys ears
outside his cabin window through the bullseye
pane he saw the familiar vista of the stars-all
blurred and unreal and flowing with a silent move-
ment in retrograde now which marked the chang-
ing positions of the heavens with the years

   the upper tier of the small vehicle with its four
cabins had a narrow corridor bisecting it like a
diameter line the corridor was unlighted save
for the glowing metal walls deely in his grey
cloth gown and his rumpled white hair moved
along the corridor toward the spiral ladder lead-
ing to the tower where he knew phil thomasson
would be on watch he mounted the ladder he
might have heard soft voices from one of the rooms
off the corridor had he stopped to listen but he

   thomasson greeted him well deely shouldnt

you be asleep

   i couldnt-i cant sleep i woke up with that
accursed problem tormenting me stay where you
are phil-ill sit here or would you rather go
to bed i shall be here several hours i imagine

   ill stay said thomasson what is sleep to
me ive been watching those crazy lurching stars
i say one might read his destiny in them if he
were clever enough mightnt he and then he d
be worse off-realizing what hell lay ahead of him

  but deely was already immersed in his formu-
lae with thomasson watching him thoughtfully
a nice fellow this deely too impractical for a
hard world of reality a fellow who was bound
to get hurt it occurred to thomasson rather too
bad that one must be destined for disillusionment
and heartache   

by some trick of fate it seemed to thomasson
that there was a sudden stillness about the
vehicle voices in a soft murmur came floating
up the ladder to the tower room

  gerald dear i must go-if he should awaken-
nonsense hilda-you know he sleeps for
hours

   gerald please   

   but i wont let you go now   

  thomasson was about to speak-to say some-
thing anything to drown the damning sounds he
had thought that deely had not heard but he saw
deelys face and its expression struck him dumb

   and again the voice of hilda floating up to them
gerald-darling im going but kiss me-once
more oh hold me close-i dont want to leave you
there seemed a strange blankness on deelys face
as though all his reasoning were paralyzed to leave
him blankly staring and slowly the blood was
draining so that he was white to the lips

  i say- began thomasson but deelys vague
gesture silenced him as effectively as if it had been
a roaring command the murmuring had ceased
momentarily there was an interval while deely
stared blankly with his pencil still poised over the
paper then the pencil dropped with a little thud
and deely was fumbling with his chair trying to
rise to his feet

  thomasson found his voice where are you
going

  downstairs i guess-i think i want to go
down   

  but i say i wouldnt do that he put a hand
on deelys thin shoulder take it easy old fel-
low give it thought i say-damn it im sorry
for you look here-dont go down there now
deely sank back i guess youre right give
it thought  i guess youre right

  mercifully there came no more of the horrible
words for minutes deely sat staring with thom-
asson regarding him what was there to say
thomasson could think of nothing it is a tragic
thing to sit and watch a man stricken by a knife
thrust into his heart by the woman he loves deely
seemed to realize it very slowly as though the
thing were impossible and all his faculties were
numbed groping with it his pale blue eyes had
been staring through the metal walls of the little
tower then at last they came and focussed upon
thomasson

  you knew-this thing

  tes i knew it

  and you did not tell me

  but how could i old fellow one does not go
like a cad and tell his-

  no thats right and mink-he knew it
  i suppose so

  and even brown so everybody knew it-ev-
erybody but me

  but i say deely look here-

  and now i know it-at last i guess youre
right-give it thought-give it thought   youll
go down to bed now wont you thomasson it
was a gentle plea i want to stay here alone-
to give it thought

  and thomasson was glad enough to escape for
it was an awkward thing to sit helplessly and watch
a man whose castle is clattering down into bits of
broken glass at his feet

  yes ill go he touched deely i say im
sorry as hell you know that

  yes-thanks

  deelys gentle white face was vaguely staring
with a confused stricken wonderment as thomas-
son went down the ladder the sleeping rooms
were quiet thomasson seeking his own peered
into the opened door-oval of deelys as he passed
it hilda lay there on her own couch apparently
asleep her black braids were on her breast the
pale slim beauty of her face seemed so pure thom-
asson sighed entered his own room and drifted af-
ter an interval into uneasy slumber

  a sudden lurching shock awakened him some-
thing was wrong with the ship he realized there
was no humming no vibration no iridescent glow
to the room-walls the time-mechanism was not
operating 

  as he gained his feet thomasson heard the dis-
tant shouts of his companions in the corridor
he ran into hilda a white spectre in her long
filmy night robe

  oh what is it mr thomasson whats wrong
where is ronald i woke up-

  gerald vane dashed toward them where is
deely what in hell has happened

there was only wan starlight in the narrow
upper corridor from its end windows vane
	wonder stories quarterly

was as white as the woman

  gerald  she clutched at him but he flung her
off

  dont do that you fool thomasson where is
deely

  in a nearby door-oval mink appeared what is
it were not-not wrecked are we in danger
vane in danger    his voice shrilled and
broke he clutched at the door casement in dan-
ger  

  from down on the lower tier brown was shout-
ing

  its gone dead everythings off whatll i
do them signals wont work to the tower-no-
body answers

  vane was rushing toward the tower ladder and
slowly the figure of deely came down he pulled
his dressing gown around his thin shoulders and
with a shaking hand smoothed his rumpled hair
but his voice was calm

  dont get excited no danger-i stopped our
time-flight

  brown arrived but professor them con-
trols  

  what matter brown come down to the
lounge all of you i want to show you the stars
through the window there the firmament is rat-
ional-at last the stars are very beautiful

  his gaze went to his wife ah hilda-have
you slept well too bad to awaken you

  look here shouted vane what are you
talking about stopped our time flight why
and no one on guard in the turret-

  in deelys drab mild eyes a sudden fire came
do as i tell you vane all of you-come down
to the lounge    stop that sniveling mink   
hilda you go ahead with gerald dont let her
fall vane she looks so frightened  

  the strange force of deely made them gather
silently in the lounge the vehicle was at rest
poised in the void of infinite space through the
windows they could all see the motionless firma-
ment freed now from the distortion of their time
flight a vast bowl of black velvet-a hollow in-
terior of unfathomable capacity with themselves
hanging in its center-and everywhere now the
motionless blazing worlds

  brown found his voice are we all crazy we
cant stop here like this we havent no air or
water to stop well be killed   

  vane gasped start the mechanism brown
you damn fool dont stay here   

  but i cant nothinworks he

  vane turned upon deely what have you done
you   

  deely suddenly back away he faced them all
with even a greater calmness

  i thought it would be a wise thing to smash the
mechanism i have no need of it any longer-so
i smashed it

  death only mink could find voice-

the words came with a shrill ascending scream
death death-oh my god   

  as though all the scene were sharpened and re-
duced to miniature thomasson saw mink clutch-
ing at his throat and screaming hilda white as a
beautiful wraith and gerald vane staring with
dumb amazement and then leaping upon deely

  wrecked us you-you- his thickened
tongue refused him you-wrecked-

  not i it was you who wrecked ua deely
sat down on the couch with pale eyes surveying
them all youandthe woman-wrecked us all
of you saw it-all but me and no one bothered to
tell me    go to him hilda theres nothing
to stop you now go and take comfort in his loving
arms

  but she only stood staring mink still scream-
ing rushed away and brown cursing to him-
self dashed for his control room vane took a
step and whirled you-crazy-fool   

  i was-but im not now hold her in your
arms vane dont you see shes frightened
thomasson gasped but i say the wall might
explode-hadnt we better try to repair the con-
trols  vane come up to the tower thats where
he-

  no use deely interrupted and now he spoke
vehemently you cant repair it the walls
wont explode-but our air is leaking out weve
a few hours-two or three sit down-if youve
anything to do before death-any things to think
about    hilda you belong in his arms i
shouldnt waste time if i were you a few hours
isnt very long for loving-like yours and his

  it seemed to the stricken thomasson that she
would fall she swayed toward vane but his ter-
rified hysterical glare and his words stopped her

  you brought this on me you with your pale
face-your kisses-

  gerald-

  you rotten little-

   vile epithet so vile that as vane turned and stag-
gered from the room thomasson was impelled to
take a menacing step toward him but deely said
come back thomasson dont bother dee-
ly was vaguely smiling she isnt-she didnt
mean to be-quite that sit down hilda-its too
bad if youre going to lack the comfort of his love
at the end-but i guess you are

            chapter v
            last moments

it all blurred for a moment to thomassons shock-
ed senses one cannot be struck with the reali-
zation of deaths inevitable nearness and maintain
normality it occurred vaguely to thomasson that
there was nothing to do he found himself seated
at the little table where he had done most of his
writing and on it before him was his note-book and
pencil   

  nothing he could do and death was coming he
heard vaguely the running footsteps of vane and
brown as they dashed around the ship    they
were trying to accomplish the impossible and
shouting frantically about it like struggling rats
in a cage immersed in water    that was an
amusing thought   

  thomasson stared across the starlit lounge at
deely and his wife they sat numbly gazing at
each other perhaps they were thinking of all the
happy moments they had once had together   
thomasson felt himself like a man dazed by drink
this little ship was a tiny world in the silent void
the derelict of space	

of interplanetary space and because death was
coming madness stalked it

  all of them were mad  it was an amusing
thought thomasson contemplated that this proxi-
mity of death was like drink perhaps they were
all their real selves for the first time since child-
hood drink does that the man of low breed-
ing becomes more vulgar the gentleman is punc-
tiliously polite   

  thomasson was aware of a turmoil outside the
room the shouts of vane and brown thudding
blows of metal against metal then a horrible
agonized death-scream from mink   

  hes locked himself in the food room vane
gasped brown get him out of there eating
our food-more than his share-keeping it from
us  

  they stood by the closed metal door mink was
inside they would hear him moving vane put
his ear to the door mink was babbling to him-
self

  all this for me nobody can have any of it but
me food and drink-thats life nobody can die
with all this food and drink

  stark mad vane heard him fall over a cask
of water the gurgle as it spilled sounded horribly
plain their precious water spilling with this
madman wasting it

  vanes fist thudded against the door mink
open here let us in

  brown shouted say you open this door

  but there was only silence as though mink
were crouching like a trapped animal

  vane pounded harder the door resounded
with the blows of the heavy iron wrench which
brown was carrying then it suddenly occurred
to vane that there was no lock on the inside of this
door

  hes got things piled against it brown only
that help me shove

  with their shoulders they heaved the door
yielded a little there was an inch of space and
now in the silence as momentarily they rested they
could hear mink scuttling back and forth around
the little room an animal trapped in a frenzy
of fear and hate the boxes of food were clatter-
ing as he scattered them and they heard his
mouthing mumbling words

  food and drink nobody can die in here  
  harder brown damn it-shove   

  the door suddenly went inward as the water
casks and boxes which were piled against it were
shoved backward over the litter vane and brown
tumbled forward the dark triangular room was
scattered with broken boxes of food and wet with
spilled water the light from the corridor shone
on mink as he crouched in his white night-robe
his hands were before him with clawing fingers
his lips snarled with bared teeth and his eyes were
blazing with maniacal fury

  you-go way get away from me

  and as vane recovered his balance the frenzied
mink was on him clawing at him gouging at his
eyes and the bared teeth closed on the flesh of his
throat

  brown good god-help

  brown saw the two swaying forms in the blue
tube-light glow from the doorway vane stumbled

and fell brown raised his heavy wrench and
crashed it upon minks head the room filled and
echoed with minks horribie death-scream and
brown staggered back staring as vane lifted him-
self from the gruesome thing on top of him

  did it brown good enough hes dead-
what of it weve saved the food and water
but brown had never killed a man before he
stammered that-looks awful them brains-
that   

  come on outside

  yes

they stumbled to the corridor brown found
himself still holding the wrench he dropped
it with a shudder

  im goin to the deck cool off that looked
awful-that blood an them brains    he wav-
ered away muttering to himself

  vane dashed to the lounge thomasson was at
his little table hilda was in a chair and deely
still sat on the couch

  vane gasped mink went crazy wrecked our
storeroom-brown killed him with a wrench-look
where he bit me stark raving mad-the fool
there was blood on vanes neck and on his chalk-
white face-some of it his own and some minks
he wiped his face with his sleeve

  the crazy fool   

  deely barely moved sit down vane no-
close that door first youre wise to come in here-
this is the best place we can hold the air a little
longer in here

  thomasson could feel that the air was going
his checks were hot and prickling as though the
blood were trying to ooze out through the skin
his head was humming-or was the roar in his
ears

  vane slammed the door i dont want to die
deely cant you do something good god weve
got to do something-not just let ourselves die like
this deely for gods sake   

  nothing i can do now deely said calmly
  the control mechanism   

  didnt you see it vane

  yes i saw it brown and i saw it you-you
smashed it  

  yes i told you that

  but deely please-you can fix it you know
more it than brown or me   

  vane was whimpering like a child hilda tell
him to fix it tell him hilda  

  but hilda deely only stared and ft seemed to the
watching fascinated thomasson that there was a
faint very queer smile on her vivid lips

  youd better sit down deely said save your
strength-the air is getting very thin losing
pressure fast  

  and just at that moment the air began escaping
still faster from a thousand places around the
little disc-like vehicle as it hung poised in the vac-
uum of space the precious air was leaking out
brown clinging to a chair on the curved starlit
deck-corridor could hear the silence of everything
broken by the faint hiss and whine of the air as it
went out

zina the killer

 by walter livingston martin

zina was ravenously hungry for several
days she had fasted this hunger had not
made her docile on the contrary it had add-
ed to her naturally ugly disposition until all
twelve joints of her body and slender tail fairly
ached with the desire to kill

  she was not a beautiful creature by any means
her body was formed by seven plump sections
graduating into a jointed and slender tail of five
sections her thorax was graced with four sets
of rather hairy legs while just back of her head
were two lengthy and sturdy pedipalps extend-
ing forward and outward ending in broad claws

  her tail which terminated in a vicious looking
sting was her death-dealing instrument and was
ordinarily carried
arched over her
back but zina was
angry now hence
her stinging appen-
dage was straight-
ened out in readi-
ness for a thrust

to accomplish this
she had merely to
curve her tail
quickly over her
back toward her
intended victim

  being an almost
fully grown six inch
scorpion zina had
passed the stag
where she could
only catch tiny insects for her prey

  came the mating season when she and her
lover had sought seclusion in a crevice in an an-
cient coral rock fence after the love-making
she had suddenly decided she must kill and kill
she did her first victim being none other than her
lover after several poisonous stabs she left
him in the agonies of death and crept forth to
seek food

  fortunately-- it was dark for had it not been
she would never had dared to come into the open
as she glided cautiously along her eyes suddenly
caught a glimpse of a slight fluttering movement
a few feet away creeping closer she saw a
huge moth in the act of settling on the rock fence
zina charged and with extreme accuracy seized
him with her lobster-like claws here indeed
was a delightful meal she hastened to cover
and there feasted leisurely

  she was not entirely unlike her distant rela-
tives the spider family in her gluttonous appe-
tite nor did she have any scruples against includ-
ing an occasional spider in her menu

  when she had finished her repast she started

out again this time in a different direction she
made her way up the side of the fence across its
broad top and down the opposite side to a cem-
ent walk some fifty feet away was a street in-
tersection made like day by the rays of an elec-
tric street light there she had reason to believe
an abundance of insects might be found to ap-
pease her

  this trek required a great deal of courage be-
cause of the danger involved in allowing herself
to become so plainly visible but would be well
worthwhile because of the choice of foods that
she might be fortunate enough to encounter she
scurried across the sidewalk barely reaching the
parkway separating it from the street in time to

avoid an encounter
with her arch ene-
my - a man luck-
ily he did not see
her or if he did he
realized the use-
less of trying to find
her once she had
concealed herself
in the vegetation

  after a short
pause she contin-
ued on her way
being intent upon
her future feast
zina failed to re-
tain her customary
caution and unex-
pectedly came up-
on a hard dark something lumbering slowly
through the grass alarmed she hurled her
sting at it only to find that the giants shell was
too strong to be easily pierced this attempt at
his life caused the beetle to turn and to zinas
chagrin he was armed with a pair of extremely
strong pinchers zina retreated a bit and none
too soon for the pinchers of her new enemy came
together with a snap that would have pierced her
body had they found their mark to run away
never occurred to the scorpion here was a
worthy opponent

  circling the beetle so as to avoid his weapon
she pounced upon his back but had difficulty in
obtaining a hold although the beetle was a
slow moving one he was strong and fighting for
his life when zina lost her hold upon him he
turned as quickly as he could making another
attempt to seize her with his horny forceps this
time he did not fail completely partially because
zina was too sure of her own prowess and did not
retreat enough this carelessness cost her one
of her claws which was snapped off so quickly
she hardly felt any sensation



 this little gem of a story is offered to our
 readers as an indication of how the ordinary
  wonders of nature make dramatic material
 the life of the scorpion is filled with phases in-
 teresting and unusual the killing of the lover
 and the succumbing to the new-born children are
 things that indicate how peculiarly nature may
 work at times

    although this story is a variation from our us-
 ual run it struck the editors fancy so much that
 we decided that we must give our readers the
 benefit of it

   we would be glad to get your comments on
 how you liked this fascinating drawing from nat-
 ures vast sketch book
zina the killer	

  the incident was a lesson to her however and
with a great deal of added caution she again
circled the beetle after two attempts she suc-
ceeded in getting the grip she sought and slowly
she brought her remaining claw under his armor-
ed wing covering the rest was easy for her-
once ingress was made under this protective cov-
ering it was a simple matter to inflict a death
wound

not desiring this particular diet she made her
way to the spot beneath the electric light and
seized a small moth which afforded her a more
tasty morsel

  it is difficult to say exactly what warned her
but she was suddenly aware of great danger as
quickly as she could he rushed through a dark
opening in the curb just in time to escape being
crushed by a street sweeping machine she
crawled further into the storm sewer and in her
haste lost her footing and fell several feet into a
stream of water that carried her along into abso-
lute darkness

  struggling until she was able to reach the damp
wall she drew herself out of the water slowly
she crawled along the side until she came to an
opening similar to the one that had been the
source of her misfortune she very carefully
made her way toward the faint light-then just
as the goal was nearly at hand two tiny balls of
fire dashed at her the body of a vicious sewer
rat was barely discernible in the dim semi-dark-
ness zina made ready for her enemy and with
a savage thrust buried her sting in the rats body
so violently did she strike him that she again
lost her hold and fell into the water

  her struggles were more feeble this time as
her recent adventures had taxed her strength al-
most to the limit when she had finally gained
the sewer wall it was necessary for her to rest
an hour before making another try for escape
while she was so occupied the body of the rat
which had been the last recipient of her sting
floated slowly by her the poison she had in-
jected into his body had been ample to end his
career

  she could not have affected a fatal wound in
all animals-for example a man would not suc-
cumb as a result of her sting but he miht ex-
perience a great deal of anguish or even become
ill it is interesting to note that in certain sec-
tions of dry desert country where scorpions
abound in large numbers some of the denizens
such as prairie dogs and foxes are made immune
by nature to their sting

  as soon as she had sufficiently recovered she
began again the slow and torturous route to free-
dom after picking her way carefully along for
a time she was again compelled to pause for rest
during the interval she tried to locate another

the

opening to the street but all about her was the
same impenetrable darkness she struggled for-
ward again and after countless periods of crawl-
ing and resting she found an exit fortunately
it was night but whether a day or several days
had elapsed she had no way of knowing

   as she crawled into the open her first thought
was of food but she was too exhausted to risk
a very strenuous encounter in making a kill zina
made several unsuccessful attempts before she
finally managed to catch a small grasshopper
the meal strengthened her and made her drowsy
so she chose a crevice under a convenient stone
and there she slept

upon awakening she was again at a loss to
know how long she had been in hiding but
it was gloriously dark she ventured forth slow-
ly searching for and finding further sustenance
after which she retired to another hiding place
unconsciously zina was slowly making her way
back to her old haunts in the ancient coral rock
wall some nights practically no distance was
covered yet always when she sought shelter she
was nearer than she had been on the previous
night

   she fed well and was quite noticeably larger
than when she had left her dying lover soon
she would be a mother which according to the
law of nature would be her last adventure

   one night when she began her search for food
she had six tiny scorpion babies clinging to her
broad back they annoyed her somewhat but
nevertheless she fed again and for the last time
-for from that time hence she seemed seized
with an urgent desire to move on and on so
through the night she crept until the first light
of dawn compelled her to seek safety in hiding

   meanwhile her offsprings were dining well
and had made considerable progress toward con-
suming the body of their mother yet she did not
die each night she moved on until finally she
reached her destination she climbed up the
wall almost but not quite losing her footing and
at last she came to the top then slowly and
carefully she crept down the opposite side find-
ing a crevice to her liking she entered clinging
to the ceiling of the shelter her strength failed
her then and she fell-not far a foot perhaps

   when her body struck the floor her babies
scattered in all directions each to shift for him-
self

   zinas body quivered for a few moments and
then lay still by some strange fate she had
returned to her former love nest she died as
she had lived-violently which is natures way
of striking a balance but unfortunately for the
romantic possibilities of this biography she left
no record as to whether she knew that her dead
lover lay beside her

shoes were replicas of those worn by himself every limb was proportioned like his


the planet entity

based on the  second prize
whining plot of the interplanetary plot contest
submitted by e m johnston box sis collingwood ont canada

it was in the fall of  three days prior to the
annual football game between stanford and the
university of california that the strange visitor
from outer space
landed in the mid-
dle of the huge stad-
ium a t berkeley
where the game was
to be held

  descending with
peculiar delibera-
tion it was seen and
pointed out by mul-
titudes of people in
the towns that bor-
der on san francis-
co bay in berkeley

oakland alameda
and san francisco
itself gleaming
with a fiery copper-
ish-golden light it
floated down from
the cloudless
autumn azure drop-
ping in a sort of
slow spiral above
the stadium it was
utterly unlike any
known type of air-
craft and was near-
ly a hundred feet in
length

  the general shape
was ovoid and also
more or less angu-
lar with a surface
divided into scores
of variant planes
and with many dia-
mond ports of pur-
plish material dif-
ferent from that of
which the body was
constructed even
at first glance it
suggested the inven-
tive genius and
workmanship o f
some alien world
of a people whose
ideas of mechanical
symmetry have been conditioned by evolutional nec-
essities and sense-faculties divergent from ours

  however when the queer vessel had come to rest
in the amphitheater many conflicting theories re-
garding its origin and the purpose of its descent
were promulgated in the bay cities there were
those who feared the invasion of some foreign foe

and who thought that the odd ship was the har-
binger of a long-plotted attack from the russian
and chinese soviets or even from germany whose

intentions were still
suspected and
many of those who
postulated an ultra-
planetary origin
were also apprehen-
sive deeming that
the visitant was per-
haps hostile and
might mark the be-
ginning of some ter-
rible incursion from
outer worlds

in the meanwhile
utterly silent and
immobile and with-
out sign of life or
occupancy the ves-
sel reposed in the
stadium where
staring crowds be-
gan to gather about
it these crowds
however were soon
dispersed by order
of the civic authori-
ties since the nat-
ure and intentions
of the stranger were
alike doubtful and
undeclared the
stadium was closed
to the public and
in case of inimical
manifest a t i o n s
machine-guns were
mounted on the
higher beats with a
company of mar-
ines in attendance
and bombing-planes
hovered in readi-
ness to drop their
lethal freight on the
shining coppery
bulk

the intensest in-
terest was felt by
the whole scientific
fraternity and a large group of professors of
chemists metallurgists astronomers astrophysi-
cists and biologists was organized to visit and ex-
amine the unknown object when on the after-
noon following its landing the local observatories
issued a bulletin saying that the vessel had been
sighted approaching the earth from translunar

 e m johnston	clark ashton smith

who furnished the plot	who wrote the story

 this story in many ways is one of the most
 unusual we have published its theme is
 not only original but at mr smiths capa-
 ble hands it takes on added meaning

   the mystery of the martian canals has been
 explained in many ways most authors assume
 that they are irrigation canals to give water to
 the dry martian deserts some astronomers be-
 lieve that they are merely illusions and do not
 really exist certainly they present to us one
 of the most fascinating puzzles of modern
 science

   messrs smith and johnston have their own ex-
 planation for the canals- as a gigantic antic sen-
 tient entity and were this planet entity to ex-
 ist it might have an intelligence an understand-
 ing and a power that would make us seem like
 microbes by comparison

   yet such an entity might one day enter into our
 lives on earth and provoke the cataclysmic storm
 of events that makes up this powerful story

space on the previous night the fact of its non-
terrestrial genesis became established beyond dis-
pute in the eyes of most and controversy reigned
as to whether it had come from venus mars mer-
cury or one of the superior planets or whether
perhaps it was a wanderer from another solar
system than our own

  but of course the nearer planets were favored in
this dispute by the majority especially mars for
as nearly as those who had watched it could deter-
mine the line of the vessels approach would have
formed a trajectory with the red planet

  all that day while argument seethed while ex-
tras with luridly speculative and fantastic head-
lines were issued by the local papers as well as by
the press of the whole civilized world while public
sentiment was divided between apprehension and
curiosity and- the guarding marines and aviators
continued to watch for signs of possible hostility
the unidentified vessel maintained its initial still-
ness and silence

  telescopes and glasses were trained upon it from
the hills above the stadium but even these dis-
closed little regarding its character those who
studied it saw that the numerous ports were made
of a vitreous material more or less transparent
but nothing stirred behind them and the glimpses
of queer machinery which they afforded in the
ships interior were meaningless to the watchers
one port larger than the rest was believed to be
a sort of door or man-hole but no one came to open
it and behind it was a weird array of motionless
rods and coils and pistons which debarred the vis-
ion from further view

  doubtless it was thought the occupants were no
less cautious of their alien milieu than the people
of the bay region were suspicious of the vessel
perhaps they feared to reveal themselves to human
eyes perhaps they were doubtful of the terrene
atmosphere and its effect upon themselves or per-
haps they were merely lying in wait and planning
some devilish outburst with unconceived weapons
or engineries of destruction

apart from the fears felt by some and the
wonderment and speculation of others a third
division of public sentiment soon began to crystal-
lize in collegiate circles and among sport-lovers
the feeling that the strange vessel had taken an un-
warrantable liberty in pre-empting the stadium
especially at a time so near to the forthcoming ath-
letic event a petition for its removal was circu-
lated and presented to the city authorities the
great metallic hull it was felt no matter whence
it had come or why should not be allowed to inter-
fere with anything so sacrosanct and of such prime
importance as a football game

  however in spite of the turmoil it had created
the vessel refused to move by so much as the frac-
tion of an inch many began to surmise that the
occupants had been overcome by the conditions of
their transit through space or perhaps they had
died unable to endure the gravity and atmospheric
pressure of the earth

  it was decided to leave the vessel unapproached
until morning of the next day when the committee
of investigation would visit it during that after-
noon and night scientists from many states were

speeding toward california by airplane and rocket-
ship to be on hand in time for this event

  it was felt advisable to limit the number of this
committee among the fortunate savants who had
been selected was john gaillard assistant astrono-
mer at the mt wilson observatory gaillard rep-
resented the more radical and freely speculative
trend of scientific thought and had become well
known for his theories concerning the inhabitabil-
ity of the inferior planets particularly mars and
venus he had long championed the idea of in-
telligent and highly organized life on these worlds
and had even published more than one treatise
dealing with the subject in which he had elaborated
his theories with much specific detail his excite-
ment at the news of the strange vessel was in-
tense he was one of those who had sighted the
gleaming and unclassifiable speck far out in space
beyond the orbit of the moon in the late hours of
the previous night and he had felt even then a pre-
monition of its true character others of the party
were free and openminded in their attitude but no
one was more deeply and vitally interested than
gaillard

  godfrey stilton professor of astronomy at the
university of california also on the committee
might have been chosen as the very antithesis of
gaillard in his views and tendencies narrow
dogmatic skeptical of all that could not be proved
by line and rule scornful of all that lay beyond
the bourn of a strait empiricism he was loath to
admit the ultra-terrene origin of the vessel or even
the possibility of organic life on any other world
than the earth several of his confreres belonged
to the same intellectual type

  apart from these two men and their fellow-scien-
tists the party included three newspaper reporters
as well as the local chief of police william poison
and the mayor of berkeley james gresham since
it was felt that the forces of government should
be represented the entire committee comprised
forty men and a number of expert machinists
equipped with acetylene torches and cutting tools
were held in reserve outside the stadium in case it
should be found necessary to open the vessel by
force

  at nine am the investigators entered the stad-
ium and approached the glittering multi-angled
object many were conscious of the thrill that at-
tends some unforeknowable danger but more were
animated by the keenest curiosity and by feelings
of extreme wonderment gaillard in especial felt
himself in the presence of ultramundane mystery
and marveled as he neared the coppery-golden
bulk his feeling amounted almost to an actual
vertigo such as would be experienced by one who
gazes athwart unfathomable gulfs upon the ar-
canic secrets and the wit-transcending wonders of
a foreign sphere it seemed to him that he stood
upon the verge between the determinate and the
incommensurable betwixt the finite and the infin-
ite

  others of the group in lesser degree were poss-
essed by similar emotions and even the hard-
headed unimaginative stilton was disturbed by a
queer uneasiness which being minded as he was
he assigned to the weather-or a touch of liver

  the strange ship reposed in utter stillness as
the planet entity	

before the fears of those who half-expected some
deadly ambush were allayed as they drew near
and the hopes of those who looked for a more amic-
able manifestation of living occupancy were un-
gratified the party gathered before the main
port which like all the others was made in the
form of a great diamond it was several feet
above their heads in a vertical angle or plane of
the hull and they stood staring through its mauve
transparency on the unknown intricate mechan-
isms beyond that were colored as if by the rich
panes of some cathedral window

  all were in doubt as to what should be done for
it seemed evident that the occupants of the vessel
if alive and conscious were in no hurry to reveal
themselves to human scrutiny the delegation re-
solved to wait a few minutes before calling on the
services of the assembled mechanics with their
acetylene torches and while waiting they walked
about and inspected the metal of the walls which
seemed to be an alloy of copper and red gold tem-
pered to a preternatural hardness by some process
unfamiliar to telluric metallurgy there was no
sign of jointure in the myriad planes and facets
and the whole enormous shell apart from its lucid
ports might well have been wrought from a single
sheet of the rich alloy

gaillard stood peering upward at the main
port while his companions sauntered about the
vessel talking and debating among themselves
somehow he felt an intuition that something
strange and miraculous was about to happen and
when the great port began to open slowly without
visible agency dividing into two valves that slid
away at the sides the thrill which he experienced
was not altogether one of surprise nor washe
surprised when a sort of metal escalator consisting
of narrow stairs that were little more than rungs
descended step by step from the opening and came
down to the ground at his very feet

  the port had opened and the escalator had un-
folded in silence with no faintest creak or clang
but others beside gaillard had perceived the oc-
currence and all hastened in great excitement and
gathered before the steps

  contrary to their not unnatural expectations
no one emerged from the vessel and they could
see little more of the interior than had been visible
through the shut valves they looked for some ex-
otic embassador from mars some gorgeous and
bizarre plenipotentiary from venus to descend the
queer steps and the silence and solitude and mech-
anical adroitness of it all were uncanny it seemed
that the great ship was a living entity and poss-
essed a brain and nerves of its own hidden in the
metal-sheathed interior

  the open portal and stairs offered an obvious in-
vitation and after some hesitancy the scientists
made up their minds to enter some were still
fearful of a trap and five of the forty men warily
decided to remain without but all the others were
more powerfully drawn by curiosity and investi-
gative ardor and one by one they climbed the
stairs and filed into the vessel

  they found the interior even more provocative
of wonder than the outer walls had been it was
quite roomy and was divided into several compart-

                          

ments of ample size two of which at the vessels
center were lined with low couches covered by soft
lustrous piliated fabrics of opalescent grey the
others as well as the ante-chamber behind the en-
trance were filled with machinery whose motive
force and method of operation were alike obscure
to the most expert among the investigators

  rare metals and odd alloys some of them diffi-
cult to classify had been used in the construction
of this machinery near the entrance there was
a sort of tripodal table or instrument-board whose
queer rows of levers and buttons were no less mys-
terious than the ciphers of some telic cryptogram
the entire ship was seemingly deserted with no
trace of human or extraplanetary life

 wandering through the apartments and marvel-
ling at the unsolved mechanical enigmas which sur-
rounded them the delegation-members were not
aware that the broad valves of the main port had
closed behind them with the same stealthiness and
silence that had marked their opening nor did
they hear the warning shouts of the five men who
had remained outside

  their first intimation of anything untoward
came from a sudden lurching and lifting of the
vessel startled they looked at the window-like
ports and saw through the violet vitreous panes
the whirling and falling away of those innumer-
able rows of seats which ringed the immense stad-
ium the alien space-ship with no visible hand to
control it was rising rapidly in air with a sort of
spiral movement it was bearing away to some
unknown world the entire delegation of hardy
scientists that had boarded it together with the
berkkeley mayor and chief of police and the three
privileged reporters who had thought to obtain
an ultra-sensational scoop for their respective
journals

chapter ii

shanghaied into space

the situation was wholly without precedent
and was more than astounding and the reac-
tions of the various men though quite divergent
in some ways were all marked by amazement and
consternation many were too stunned and con-
founded to realize all the implications or possibili-
ties others were frankly terrified and others still
were indignant

  this is an outrage thundered stilton as soon
as he had recovered a little from his primary sur-
prise there were similar exclamations from
others of the same temperament as he all of whom
felt emphatically that something should be done
about the situation and that someone who un-
fortunately they could not locate or identify
should be made to suffer for such unparallelled
audacity

  gaillard though he shared in the general am-
azement was thrilled to the bottom of his heart
by a sense of unearthly and prodigious adventure
by a premonition of interplanetary emprise he
felt a mystic certainty that he and the others had
embarked on a voyage to some world untrodden
heretofore by man that the strange vessel had
descended to earth and had opened its port to in-
	wonder stories quarterly

vite them for his very purpose that an esoteric
and remote power was guiding its every move-
ment and was drawing it to an appointed destina-
tion vast inchoate images of unbounded space
and splendor and interstellar strangeness filled his
mind and unforelimnable pictures rose to dazzle
his vision from an ultra-telluric bourn

  in some incomprehensible way he knew that
his life-long desire to penetrate the mysteries of
distant spheres would soon be gratified and he if
not his companions was resigned from the very
first to that bizarre abduction and captivity in the
soaring space flier

  discussing their position with much volubility
and vociferousness the assembled savants rushed
to the various ports and stared down at the world
they were leaving in a mere fraction of time
they had risen to a cloud-like altitude the whole
region about san francisco bay as well as the
verges of the pacific ocean lay stretched below
them like an immense relief map and they could
already see the curvature of the horizon which
seemed to reel and dip as they went upward

  it was an awesome and magnificent prospect
but the growing acceleration of the vessel which
had now gained a speed more than equal to that
of the rocket-ships which were used at that time
for circling the globe in the stratosphere soon com-
pelled them to relinquish their standing position
and seek the refuge of the convenient couches
conversation also was abandoned for everyone be-
gan to experience an almost intolerable constric-
tion and oppression which held their bodies as if
with clamps of unyielding metal

  however when they had all laid themselves on
the piliated couches they felt a mysterious relief
whose source they could not ascertain it seemed
that a force emanated from those couches which
alleviated in some way the leaden stress of in-
creased gravity due to the acceleration and made
it possible for the men to endure the terrific speed
with which the space-flier was leaving the earths
atmosphere and gravitational zone

  presently they found themselves able to stand up
and walk around once more their sensations on
the whole were almost normal though in contra-
distinction to the initial crushing weight there was
now an odd lightness when compelled them to shor-
ten their steps to avoid colliding with the walls and
machinery their weight was less than it would
have been on earth but the loss was not enough
to produce discomfort or sickness and was ac-
companied by a sort of exhilaration

  they perceived that they were breathing a thin
rarefied and bracing air not dissimilar to that of
terrene mountain-tops though permeated by one
or two unfamiliar elements that gave it a touch of
nitric sharpness this air tended to increase the
exhilaration and to quicken their respiration and
pulses a little

  this is damnable spluttered the indignant
stilton as soon as he found that the powers of
locomotion and breathing were reasonably subject
to control it is contrary to all law decency and
order the u s government should do something
about it immediately

  i fear observed gaillard that we are now
beyond the jurisdiction of the u s as well as that

of all other mundane governments no plane or
rocket-ship could reach the air-strata through
which we are passing and we will penetrate the
interstellar ether in a moment or so presumably
this vessel is returning to the world from which it
came and we are going with it

  absurd preposterous outrageous stiltons
voice was a roar slightly subdued and attenuated
by the fine atmospheric medium ive always
maintained that space-travel was utterly chimeri-
cal even earth-scientists havent been able to
invent a space-ship and it is ridiculous to assume
that highly intelligent life capable of such inven-
tion could exist on other planets

  how then queried gaillard do you account
for our situation

  the vessel is of human origin of course it
must be a new and ultra-powerful type of rocket-
ship devised by the soviets and under automatic
or radio control which will probably land us in
siberia after travelling in the highest layers of the
stratosphere

gaillard smiling with gentle irony felt that
he could safely abandon the argument leav-
ing stilton to stare wrathfully through a port at
the receding bulk of the world on which the whole
of north america together with alaska and the
hawaiian islands had begun to declare their coast-
al outlines he joined others of the party in a re-
newed investigation of the ship

  some still maintained that living beings must
be hidden on board but a close search of every
apartment corner and cranny resulted as before
abandoning this objective the men began to re-
examine the machinery whose motive-power and
method of operation they were still unable to fath-
om utterly perplexed and mystified they watched
the instrument-board on which certain of the keys
would move occasionally as if shifted by an un-
seen hand these changes of alignment were al-
ways followed by some change in the vessels speed
or by a slight alteration of its course possibly to
avoid collision with meteoric fragments

  though nothing definite could be learned about
the propelling mechanism certain negative facts
were soon established the method of propulsion
was plainly non-explosive for there were no roar-
ing and flaming discharge of rockets all was sil-
ent gliding and vibrationless with nothing to be-
token mechanical activity other than the shifting
of the keys and the glowing of certain intricate
coils and pistons with a strange blue light this
light cold as the scintillation of arctic ice was not
electric in its nature but suggested rather some
unknown form of radio-activity

  after awhile stilton joined those who were
grouped about the instrument-board still mutter-
ing his resentment of the unlawful and unscientific
indignity to which he had been subjected he watch-
ed the keys for a minute or so and then seizing one
of them suddenly with his fingers he tried to ex-
periment with the idea of gaining control of the
vessels movements

  to his amazement and that of his confreres the
key was immovable stilton strained till the blue
veins stood out on his hand and sweat poured in
rills from his baldish brow then one by one he
the planet entity	

tried others of the keys tugging desperately but
always with the same result evidently the board
was locked against other control than that of the
unknown pilot

  still persisting in his endeavor stilton came to
a key of larger size and different shape from the
rest touching it he screamed in agony and with-
drew his fingers from the strange object with some
difficulty the key was cold as if it had been
steeped in the absolute zero of space it had ac-
tually seemed to sear his fingers with its extreme
iciness after that he desisted and made no fur-
ther effort to interfere with the workings of the
vessel

  gaillard after watching this interlude had wan-
dered back to one of the main apartments peering
out once more from his seat on a couch of supernal
softness and resilience he beheld a breath-taking
spectacle the whole world a great glowing
many-tinted globe was swimming abreast of the
flier in the black and star-lined gulf the awful-
ness of the undirectioned deeps the unthinkable
isolation of infinitude rushed upon him and he felt
sick and giddy for a few instants with the shock of
realization and was swept by an overwhelming
panic limitless and without name

  then strangely the terror passed in a dawning
exultation at the prospect of the novel voyage
through unsounded heavens and toward untrodden
shores oblivious of danger forgetful of the dread
alienation from mans accustomed environment he
gave himself up to a magical conviction of mar-
vellous adventure and unique destiny to come

  others however were less capable of orienta-
ting themselves to these bizarre and terrific cir-
cumstances pale and horror-stricken with a sense
of irredeemable loss of all-encompassing peril and
giddy confusion they watched the receding earth
from whose comfortable purlieus they had been
removed so inexplicably and with such awful sud-
denness

  many were speechless with fear as they realized
more clearly their impotence in the grip of an all-
powerful and incognizable force

  some chattered loudly and incoherently in an
effort to conceal their perturbation the three re-
porters lamented their inability to communicate
with the journals they represented james gres-
ham the mayor and william poison the chief of
police were non-plussed and altogether at a loss
as to what to do or think in circumstances that
seemed to nullify completely their wonted civic
importance and the scientists as might have
been expected were divided into two main camps
the more radical and adventurous were more or
less prone to welcome whatever might be in store
for the sake of new knowledge while the others
accepted their fate with varying degrees of reluct-
ance of protest and apprehension

several hours went by and the moon a ball
of dazzling desolation in the great abyss had
been left behind with the waning earth the flier
was speeding alone through the cosmic vastness
in a universe whose grandeur was a revelation
even to the astronomers familiar as they were
with the magnitudes and multitudes of suns neb-
ulae and galaxies the thirty-five men were being

estranged from their natal planet and hurled across
unthinkable immensity at a speed far beyond that
of any solar body or satellite it was hard to es-
timate the precise velocity but some idea of it
could be gained from the rapidity with which the
sun and the nearer planets mars mercury and
venus changed their relative positions they
seemed almost to fly athwart the heavens like so
many jugglers balls

  it was plain that some sort of artificial gravity
prevailed in the ship for the weightlessness that
would otherwise have been inevitable in outer
space was not experienced at any time also the
scientists found that they were being supplied with
air from certain oddly-shapen tanks evidently
too there was some kind of hidden heating-eystem
or mode of insulation against the interspatial zero
for the temperature of the vessels interior re-
mained constant at about  or 

  looking at their watches some of the party
found that it was now noon by terrestrial time
though even the most unimaginative were impress-
ed by the absurdity of the twenty-four hour divi-
sion of day and night amid the eternal sunlight of
the void

  many began to feel hungry and thirsty and to
voice their appetence aloud not long after as if
in response like the service given by a good table
dhote or restaurant certain panels in the inner
metal wall hitherto unnoticed by the savants
opened noiselessly before their eyes and revealed
a series of long buffets on which were curious wide-
mouthed ewers containing water and deep tureen-
like plates filled to the rim with unknown food-
stuffs

  too astonished to comment at much length on
this new miracle the delegation-members pro-
ceeded to sample the viands and beverage thus of-
fered stilton still morosely indignant refused to
taste them but was alone in his abstention

  the water was quite drinkable though slightly
alkaline as if it had come from desert wells and
the food a sort of reddish paste concerning whose
nature and composition the chemists were doubtful
served to appease the pangs of hunger even if it
was not especially seductive to the palate

  after the earth-men had partaken of this re-
fection the panels closed as silently and unob-
trusively as they had opened the vessel plunged
on through space hour after hour till it became
obvious to gaillard and his fellow-astronomers that
it was either heading directly for the planet mars
or would pass very close to mars on its way to
some further orb

  the red world with its familiar markings which
they had watched so often through observatory
telescopes and over whose character and causation
they had long puzzled began to loom before them
and swelled upon the heavens with thaumaturgic
swiftness then they perceived a signal decelera-
tion in the speed of the flier which continued
straight on toward the coppery planet as if its goal
were concealed amid the labyrinth of obscure and
singular mottlings and it became impossible to
doubt any longer that mars was their destination

  gaillard and those who were more or less akin
to him in their interests and proclivities were
stirred by an awesome and sublime expectancy as
	wonder stories quarterly

the vessel neared the alien world then it began
to float gently down above an exotic landscape in
which the well-known seas and canals enorm-
ous with their closeness could plainly be recog-
nized

  soon they approached the surface of the ruddy
planet spirahng though its cloudless and mistless
atmosphere while the deceleration slowed to a
speed that was little more than that of a falling
parachute mars surrounded them with its strait
monotonous horizons nearer than those of earth
and displaying neither mountains nor any salient
elevation of hills or hummocks and soon they
hung above it at an altitude of a half-mile or less
here the vessel seemed to halt and poise without
descending further

  below them now they saw a desert of low-ridged
and yellowish-red sand intersected by one of the
so-called canals which ran sinuously away on
either side to disappear beyond the horizon

  the scientists studied this terrain in ever-grow-
ing amazement and excitement as the true nature
of the veining canal was forced upon their per-
ception it was not water as many had heretofore
presumed but a mass of pale-green vegetation of
vast and serrate leaves or fronds all of which
seemed to emanate from a single crawing flesh-
colored stalk several hundred feet in diameter and
with swollen nodular joints at half-mile intervals
aside from this anomalous and super-gigantic vine
there was no trace of life either animal or vege-
table in the whole landscape and the extent of
the crawling stalk which netted the entire visible
terrain but seemed by its form and characteristics
to be the mere tendril of some vaster growth was
a thing to stagger the preconceptions of mundane
botany

chapter iii

the giant of mart

many of the scientists were almost stupefied
with astonishment as they gazed down from
the violet ports on this titanic creeper more than
ever the journalists mourned the staggering head-
lines with which they would be unable under ex-
isting circumstances to endow their respective
dailies gresham and poison felt that there was
something vaguely illegal about the existence of
anything so monstrous in the way of a plant-form
and the scientific disapproval felt by stilton and his
academically minded confreres was most pro-
nounced

  outrageous unheard-of ludicrous muttered
stilton this thing defies the most elementary
laws of botany there is no conceivable precedent
for it

  gaillard who stood beside him was so wrapt in
his contemplation of the novel growth that he
scarcely heard stiltons comment the conviction
of vast and sublime adventure which had grown
upon him ever since the beginning of that bizarre
stupendous voyage was now confirmed by a clear
daylight certitude he could give no definite form
or coherence to the feeling that possessed him but
he was overwhelmed by the intimation of present

marvel and future miracle and the intuition of
strange tremendous revelations to come

  few of the party cared to speak or would have
been capable of speech all that had happened to
them during the past few hours and all on which
they now gazed was so far beyond the scope of
human action and cognition that the normal exer-
cise of their faculties was more or less inhibited
by the struggle for adjustment to these unique
conditions

  after they had watched the gargantuan vine for
a minute or two the savants became aware that
the vessel was moving again this time in a lateral
direction flying very slowly and deliberately it
followed the course of the creeper toward what
seemed to be the west of mars above which a small
and pallid sun was descending through the dingy
burnt-out sky and casting a thin chilly light ath-
wart the desolate land

  the men were overpoweringly conscious of an
intelligent determination behind all that was oc-
curring and the sense of this remote unknowable
supervision and control was stronger in gaillard
even than in the others no one could doubt that
every movement of the vessel was timed and pre-
destined  and gaillard felt that the slowness with
which it followed the progress of the great stalk
was calculated to give the scientific delegation am-
ple opportunity for the study of their new environ-
ment and in particular for observation of the
growth itself

  in vain however did they watch their shifting
milieu for aught that could denote the presence of
organic forms of a human non-human or preter-
human type such as might imaginably exist on
mars of course only such entities it was thought
could have built despatched and guided by some
kind of automatic or radio control the vessel in
which they were held captive

  the flier went on for a least an hour traversing
an immense territory in which after many miles
the initial sandy desolation yielded place to a sort
of swamp here where sluggish waters webbed
the marly soil the winding creeper swelled to in-
credible proportions with lush leaves that embow-
ered the marshy ground for almost a mile on either
side of the overlooming stalk

  here too the foliage assumed a richer and more
vivid greenness fraught with sublime vital exu-
berance  and the stem itself displayed an indescrib-
able succulence together with a shining and glossy
luster a bloom that was weirdly and incongruously
suggestive of well-nourished flesh the thing
seemed to palpitate at regular and rhythmic inter-
vals beneath the eyes of the observers like a living
entity and in places there were queerly shaped
nodes or attachments on the stem whose purpose
no one could imagine

  gaillard called the attention of stilton to the
strange throbbing that was noticeable in the plant
a throbbing which seemed to communicate itself
even to the hundred-foot leaves so that they trem-
bled like plumes

  humph said stilton shaking his head with
and air of mingled disbelief and disgust that
palpitation is altogether impossible there must be
something wrong with our eyes-some disturbance
of focus brought on by the velocity of our voyage
the planet entity	

perhaps either that or there is some peculiar re-
fractive quality in the atmosphere which gives the
appearance of movement to stable objects

  gaillard refrained from calling his attention to
the fact that this imputed phenomenon of visual
disorder or aerial refraction was confined in its
application entirely to the plant and did not extend
its range to the bordering landscape

soon after this the vessel came to an enormous
branching of the plant and the earth-men dis-
covered that the stalk they had been following was
merely one of three that ramified from a vaster
stem to intersect the boggy soil at widely divergent
angles and vanish athwart opposing horizons the
junction was marked by a mountainous double node
that bore a bizarre likeness to human hips here
the throbbing was stronger and more perceptible
than ever and odd veinings and mottlings of a
reddish color were visible on the pale surface of
the stem

  the savants became more and more excited by
the unexampled magnitude and singular character-
istics of this remarkable growth but revelations
of a still more extraordinary nature were in stora
after poising a moment above the monstrous joint
the vessel flew on at a higher elevation with in-
creased speed along the main stem which extend-
ed for an incalculable distance into the occident of
mars it revealed fresh ramifications at variable
intervals and growing ever larger and more lux-
uriant as it penetrated marshy regions which were
doubtless the residual ooze of a sunken sea

  my god the thing must surround the entire
planet said one of the reporters in an awed voice

  it looks that way gaillard assented gravely
we must be travelling almost in a line with the
equator and we have already followed the plant
for hundreds of miles from what we have seen
it would seem that the martian canals are merely
its branchings and perhaps the areas mappedjas
seas by astronomers are masses of its foliage

  i cant understand it grumbled stilton the
damned thing is utterly contrary to science and
against nature-it oughtnt to exist in any rational
or conceivable cosmos

   well said gaillard a little tartly it does ex-
ist and i dont see how you are going to get away
from it apparently too it is the only vegetable
form on the planet at least so far we have failed
to find anything else of the sort after all why
shouldnt the floral life of mars be concentered in
a single type and why shouldnt there be just
one example of that type it shows a marvellous
economy on the part of nature there is no reason
at all for assuming that the vegetable or even the
animal kingdoms on other worlds would exhibit
the same fission and multiplicity that are shown
on earth

  stilton as he listened to this unorthodox argu-
ment glared at gaillard like a mohammedan at
some errant infidel but was either too angry or too
disgusted for further speech

  the attention of the scientists was now drawn
by a greenish area along the line of their flight
covering many square miles here they saw that
the main stem had put out a multitude of tendrils
whose foliage hid the underlying soil like a thick

forest even as gaillard had postulated the origin
of the sea-like areas on mars was now explained

  forty or fifty miles beyond this mass of folia-
tion they came to another that was even more ex-
tensive the vessel soared to a great height and
they looked down on the realm-wide expanse of
leafage in its middle they discerned a circular
node leagues in extent and rising like a rounded
alp from which emanated in all directions the plan-
et-circling stems of the weird growth not only the
size but also certain features of the immense node
were provocative of utter dumfoundment in the be-
holders it was like the head of some gargantuan
cuttle-fish and the stalks that ran away on all
sides were suggestive of tentacles and strangest
of all the men descried in the center of the head
two enormous masses clear and lucent like water
which combined the size of lakes with the form and
appearance of optic organs

  the whole plant palpitated like a breathing bos-
om  and the awe with which the involuntary explor-
ers surveyed it was incommunicable by human
words all were compelled to recognize that even
aside from its unparallelled proportions and habit
of growth the thing was in no sense alliable with
any mundane botanic genera and to gaillard as
well as to others the thought occurred that it was
a sentient organism and that the throbbing mass
on which they now gazed was the brain or central
ganglion of its unknown nervous system

  the vast eyes holding the sunlight like colossal
dew-drops seemed to return their scrutiny with an
unreadable and superhuman intelligence and gail-
lard was obsessed by the feeling that preternatural
knowledge and wisdom bordering upon omniscience
were hidden in those hyaline depths

  the vessel began to descend and settled vertical-
ly down in a sort of valley close to the mountainous
head where the foliation of two departing stems
had left a patch of clear land it was like a forest
glade with impenetrable woods on three sides and
a high crag on the fourth here for the first time
during the experience of its occupants the flier
came to rest on the soil of mars floating gently
down without jar or vibration and almost immed-
iately after its landing the valves of the main port
unfolded and the metal stairway descended to the
ground in obvious readiness to disembark the hu-
man passengers

one by one some with caution and timidity
others with adventuresome eagerness the
men filed out of the vessel and started to inspect
their surroundings they found that the martian
air differed little if at all from that which they had
been breathing in the space-flier and at that hour
with the sun still pouring into the strange valley
from the west the temperature was moderately
warm

  it was an outre and fantastic scene and the
details were unlike those of any tellurian landscape
underfoot was a soft resilient soil like a moist
loess wholly devoid of grass lichens fungi or any
minor plant-forms the foliage of the mammoth
vine with horizontal fronds of a baroque type
feathery and voluminous hung about the glade to
an altitudinous height like that of ancient ever-
	wonder stories quarterly

greens and quivered in the windless air with the
pulsation of the stems

   close at hand there rose the vast flesh-colored
wall of the central plant-head which sloped upward
like a hill toward the hidden eyes and was no doubt
deeply embedded and rooted in the martian soil
stepping close to the living mass the earthmen saw
that its surface was netted with millions of wrin-
kle-like reticulations and was filled with great
pores resembling those of animal skin beneath some
extra-powerful microscope they conducted their
inspection in an awe-struck silence and for some
time no one felt able to voice the extraordinary con-
clusions to which most of them had now been
driven

   the emotions of gaillard were almost religious
as he contemplated the scarce-imaginable ampli-
tude of this ultra-terrene life-form which seemed
to him to exhibit attributes nearer to those of div-
inity than he had found in any other manifesta-
tion of the vital principle

   in it he saw the combined apotheosis of the an-
imal and the vegetable the thing was so perfect
and complete and allsufficing so independent of
lesser life in its world-enmeshing growth it
poured forth the sense of aeonian longevity per-
haps of immortality and to what arcanic and cos-
mic consciousness might it not have attained dur-
ing the cycles of its development what super-
normal senses and faculties might it not possess

 	what powers and potentialities beyond the achieve-
 ment of more limited more finite forms

   in a lesser degree many of his companions were
aware of similar feeling almost in the presence
of this portentous and sublime anomaly they for-
got the unsolved enigma of the space-vessel and
their voyage across the heretofore unbridged im-
mensities but stilton and his brother-conserva-
tives were highly scandalized by the inexplicable
nature of it all and if they had been religiously
minded they would have expressed their sense of
violation and outrage by saying that the monstrous
plant as well as the unexampled events in which
they had taken an unwilling part were tainted with
the most grievous heresy and flagrant blasphemy

  gresham who had been eyeing his surroundings
with a pompous and puzzled solemnity was the
first to break the silence

  i wonder where the local government hangs
out he queried who the hell is in power here
anyway hey mr gaillard you astronomers
know a lot about mars aint there a u s consu-
late somewhere in this god-forsaken hole

   gaillard was compelled to inform him that there
was no consular service on mars and also that the
form of government on that planet as well as its
official location was still an open problem

   however he went on i shouldnt be surprised
to learn that we are now in the presence of the sole
and supreme ruler of the martian realms

  huh i dont see anyone grunted gresham
with a troubled frown as he surveyed the quivering
masses of foliage and the alp-like head of the great
plant the import of gaillards observation was
too far beyond his intellectual orbit

   gaillard had been inspecting the flesh-tinted wall
 of the head with supreme and fascinated interest
 at some distance to one side he perceived certain

peculiar outgrowths either shrunken or vestigial
like drooping and flaccid horns they were large
as a mans body and might at some time have been
much larger it seemed as if the plant had put
them forth for some unknown purpose and had al-
lowed them to wither when the purpose had been
accomplished they still retained an uncanny sug-
gestion of semi-human parts and members of
strange appendages half arms and half tentacles
as if they had been modelled from some exemplar
of undiscovered martian animal life

  just below them on the ground gaillard noticed
a litter of queer metallic tools with rough sheets
and formless ingots of the same coppery material
from which the space-flier had been constructed

chapter iv

the astounding creation

somehow the spot suggested an abandoned
ship-yard though there were no scaffoldings
such as would ordinarily be used in the building
of a vessel an odd inkling of the truth arose in
gaillards mind as he surveyed the metal remnants
but he was too thoroughly bemused and overawed
by the wonder of all that had occurred as well as
by all he had ascertained or surmised to communi-
cate his inferences to the other savants

  in the meanwhile the entire party had wandered
about the glade which comprised an area of several
hundred yards one of the astronomers philip
colton who had made a side-line of botany was
examining the serried foliage of the super-gigantic
creepers with a mingling of utmost interest and
perplexity the fronds or branches were lined
with pinnate needles covered by a long silk pubes-
cence  and each of these needles was four feet in
length by three or four inches in thickness possibly
with a hollow and tubular structure the fronds
grew in level array from the main creeper filling
the air like a horizontal forest and reaching to the
very ground in close imbricated order

  colton took a jack-knife from his pocket and
tried to cut a section from one of the pinnate
leaves at the first touch of the keen blade the
whole frond recoiled violently beyond his reach
and then swinging back it dealt him a tremend-
ous blow which stretched him on the ground and
hurled the knife from his fingers to a consider-
able distance

  if it had not been for the lesser gravity of mars
have been severely injured by the fall at it
was he lay bruised and breathless staring with
ludicrous surprise at the great frond which had
resumed its former position among its fellows
and now displayed no other movement than the
singular trembling due to the rhythmic palpita-
tion of the stem to which it was attached

  coltons discomfiture had been noticed by his
confreres and all at once as if their tongues
had been loosed by this happening a babel of
discussion arose among them it was no longer
possible for anyone to doubt the animate or
half-animate nature of the growth and even the
outraged and ireful stilton who considered that
the most sacred laws of scientific probity were
being violated was driven to concede the pres-
the planet entity	

ence of a biologic riddle not to be explained in
terms of orthodox morphology

  gaillard who did not care to take any great
part in this discussion preferring his own
thoughts and conjectures continued to watch
the trobbing growth he stood a little apart
from the others and nearer than they to the
fleshy and multiporous slope of the huge head
and all at once as he watched he saw the
sprouting of what appeared to be a new tendril
from the surface at a distance of about four
feet above the ground

  the thing grew like something in a slow mov-
ing-picture lengthening out and swelling visibly
with a bulbous knob at the end this knob soon
became a large faintly convoluted mass whose
outlines puzzled and tantalized gaillard with
their intimation of something he had once seen
but could not now remember there was a biz-
arre hint of nascent limbs and members which
soon become more definite and then with a
sort of shock he saw that the thing resembled
a human foetus

  his involuntary exclamation of amazement
drew others and soon the whole delegation was
grouped about him watching the incredible de-
velopment of the new growth with bated breath
the thing had put forth two well-formed legs
which now rested on the ground supporting
with their five-toed feet the upright body on
which the human head and arms were fully
evolved though they had not yet attained adult
size

  the process continued and simultaneously
a sort of woolly floss began to appear around the
trunk arms and legs like the rapid spinning of
some enormous cocoon the hands and neck
were left bare but the feet were covered with
a different material which took on the appear-
ance of green leather when the floss thickened
and darkened to an iron-grey and assumed quite
modish outlines it became obvious that the fig-
ure was being clothed in garments such as were
worn by the earth-men probably in deference
to human ideas of modesty

  the thing was unbelievable and stranger and
more incredible than all else was the resem-
blance which gaillard and his companions be-
gan to note in the face of the still growing fig-
ure gaillard felt as if he were looking into a
mirror for in all essential details the face was
his own the garments and shoes were faithful
replicas of those worn by himself and every
limb and part of this outre being even to the
finger-tips was proportioned like his

  the scientists saw that the process of growth
was apparently complete the figure stood with
shut eyes and a somewhat blank and expression-
less look on its features like that of a man who
has not yet awakened from slumber it was
still attached by a thick tendril to the breath-
ing mountainous node and this tendril issued
from the base of the brain like an oddly misplaced
umbilical cord

the figure opened its eyes and stared at gail-
lard with a long level enigmatic gaze that
deepened his sense of shock and stupefaction

he sustained this gaze with the weirdest feeling
imaginable-the feeling that he was confronted
by his alter ego by a doppelganger in which was
also the soul or intellect of some alien and vaster
entity in the regard of the cryptic eyes he felt
the same profound and sublime mystery that had
looked out from the lake-sized orbs of shining
dew or crystal in the plant-head

  the figure raised its right hand and seemed
to beckon to him gaillard went slowly forward
till he and his miraculous double stood face to
face then the strange being placed its hand
on his brow and it seemed to gaillard that a
mesmeric spell was laid upon him from that
moment almost without his own volition for
a purpose he was not yet permitted to under-
stand he began to speak and the figure imita-
ting his every tone and cadence repeated the
words after him

  it was not till many minutes had elapsed that
gaillard realized the true bearing and signific-
ance of this remarkable colloquy then with a
start of clear consciousness he knew that he
was giving the figure lessons in the english lang-
uage he was pouring forth in a fluent unin-
terrupted flood the main vocabulary of the
tongue together with its grammatical rules
and somehow by a miracle of super-intellect
all that he said was being comprehended and
remembered by his interlocutor

  hours must have gone by during this process
and the martian sun was now dipping toward
the serrate walls of foliage dazed and exhaust-
ed gaillard realized that the long lesson was
over for the being removed its hand from his
brow and addressed him in scholarly well-mod-
ulated english

  thank you i have learned all that i need
to know for the purposes of linguistic communi-
cation if you and your confreres will now at-
tend me i shall explain all that has mystified
you and declare the reasons for which you have
been brought from your own world to the shores
of a foreign planet

  like men in a dream barely crediting the
fantastic evidence of their senses and yet unable
to refute or repudiate it the earth-men listened
while gaillards amazing double continued

  the being through whom i speak made in
the likeness of one of your own party is a mere
special organ which i have developed so that i
could communicate with you i the informing
entity who combine in myself the utmost gen-
ius and energy of those two divisions of life
which are known to you as the plant and the
animal-i who possess the virtual omniety and
immortality of a god have had no need of ar-
ticulate speech or formal language at any prev-
ious time in my existence but since i include
in myself all potentialities of evolution together
with mental powers that verge upon omniscience
i have had no difficulty whatever in acquiring
this new faculty

  it was i who constructed with other special
organs that i had put forth for this purpose the
space-flier that descended upon your planet and
then returned to me bearing a delegation most
of whom i have surmised would represent the
	wonder stories quarterly

scientific fraternities of mankind the building
of the flier and its mode of control will be made
plain when i tell you that i am the master of
many cosmic forces beyond the rays and ener-
gies known to tellurian savants these forces i
can draw from the air the soil or the ether at
will or can even summon from remote stars and
nebulae

  the space-vessel was wrought from metal
which i had integrated from molecules floating
at random through the atmosphere and i used
the solar rays in concentrated form to create
the temperature at which these metals were
fused into a single sheet the power used in
propelling and guiding the vessel is a sort of
super-electric energy whose exact nature i shall
not elucidate other than to say that it is associ-
ated with the basic force of gravity and also
with certain radiant properties of the interstel-
lar ether not detectible by any instruments which
you possess i established in the flier the gravi-
tation of mars and supplied it with martian air
and water and also with chemically created
food-stuffs in order to accustom you during your
voyage to the conditions that prevail on mars

  i am as you may have already surmised the
sole inhabitant of this world i could multiply
myself if necessary but so far for reasons
which you will soon apprehend i have not felt
that this would be desirable being complete
and perfect in myself i have had no need of
companionship with other entities and long ago
for my own comfort and security i was com-
pelled to extirpate certain rival plant-forms and
also certain animals who resembled slightly the
mankind of your world and who in the course
of their evolution were becoming troublesome
and even dangerous to me

  with my two great eyes which possess an
optic magnifying power beyond that of your
strongest telescopes i have studied earth and
the other planets during the martian nights and
have learned much regarding the conditions that
exist upon each the life of your world your
history and the state of your civilization have
been in many ways an open book to me and i
have also formed an accurate idea of the geolog-
ical faunal and floral phenomena of your globe
i understand your imperfections your social in-
justice and maladjustment and the manifold
disease and misery to which you are liable ow-
ing to the dissonant multiple entities into which
the expression of your life-principle has been
subdivided

trom all such evils and errors i am ex-

  r empt i have attained to well-night abso-
lute knowledge and masterdom and there is no
longer anything in the universe for me to fear
aside from the inevitable process of dehydra-
tion and dessication which mars is slowly under-
going like all other aging planets

  this process i am unable to retard except
in a limited and partial manner and i have al-
ready been compelled to tap the artesian waters
of the planet in many places i could live upon
sunlight and air alone but water is necessary
to maintain the alimental properties of the at-

mosphere  and without it my immortality would
fail in the course of time my giant stems would
shrink and shrivel and my vast innumerable
leaves would grow sere for want of the vital
humor

  your world is still young with superabun-
dant seas and streams and a moisture-laden air
you have more than is requisite of the element
which i lack and i have brought you here as
representative members of mankind to propose
an exchange which cannot be anything but bene-
ficial to you as well as to myself

  in return for a modicum of the water of your
world i will offer you the secrets of eternal life
and infinite energy and will teach you to over-
come your social imperfections and to master
wholly your planetary environment because of
my great size my stems and tendrils which
girdle the martian equator and reach even to
the poles it would be impossible for me to leave
my natal world but i will teach you how to
colonize the other planets and explore the uni-
verse beyond for these various ends i suggest
the making of an intermundane treaty and a per-
manent alliance between myself and the peoples
of earth

  consider well what i offer you for the oppor-
tunity is without example or parallel in rela-
tion to men i am like a god in comparison with
insects the benefits which i can confer upon
you are inestimable and in return i ask only
that you establish on earth under my instruc-
tion certain transmitting stations using a super-
potent wave-length by means of which the es-
sential elements of sea-water minus the unde-
sirable saline properties can be teleported to
mars the amount thus abstracted will make
little or no difference in your tide-levels or in the
humidity of your air but for me it will mean
an assurance of everlasting life

  the figure ended its peroration and stood
regarding the earth-men in polite and somewhat
inscrutable silence it wait for their answer

  as might have been expected the emotions
with which the delegation-members had heard
this singular address were far from unanimous
in their tenor all the men were beyond mere
surprise or astonishment for miracle had been
piled upon miracle till their brains were be-
numbed with wonder and they had reached the
point where they took the creation of a human
figure and its endowment with human utterance
wholly for granted but the proposal made by
the plant-entity through its man-like organ was
another matter and it played upon varying
chords in the minds of the scientists the report-
ers the mayor and the chief of police

  gaillard who felt himself wholly in accord
with this proposition and more and more thor-
oughly en rapport with the martian entity wish-
ed to accede at once and to pledge his own sup-
port and that of his fellows to a furthering of
the suggested treaty and plan of exchange he
was forced to point out to the martian that the
delegation even if single-minded in its consent
was not empowered to represent the peoples of
earth in forming the projected alliance that the
most it could do would be to lay the offer before
the planet entity	

the government of the u s and of other terres-
trial realms

  half the scientists after some deliberation
announced themselves as being in favor of the
plan and willing to promote it to the utmost of
their ability the three reporters were also will-
ing to do the same and they promised perhaps
rashly that the influence of the world-press
would be added to that of the renowned savants

  stilton and the other dogmatists of the party
however were emphatically and even rapidly
opposed and declined to consider the martians
offer for an instant any treaty or alliance of
the sort they maintained would be highly un-
desirable and improper it would never do for
the nations of earth to involve themselves in an
entanglement of such questionable nature or to
hold commerce of any sort with a being such as
the plant-monster which had no rightful bio-
logic status it was unthinkable that orthodox
and sound-minded scientists should lend their
advocacy to anything so dubious they felt too
that there was a savpr of deception and trickery
about the whole business and at any rate it was
too irregular to be countenanced or even to be
considered with anything but reprehension

  the schism among the savants was rendered
final by a hot argument in which stilton roundly
denounced gaillard and the other pro-martians
as virtual traitors to humanity and intellectual
bolshevists whose ideas were dangerous to the
integrity of human thought gresham and poi-
son were on the side of mental law and order
being professionally conservative and thus the
party was about evenly divided between those
who favored accepting the martians offer and
those who spurned it with more or less suspicion
and indignation

chapter v

the return to earth

during the course of this vehement dispute
the sun had fallen behind the high ramparts
of foliage and an icy chill such as might well
be looked for in a semi-desolate world with at-
tenuating air had already touched the pale rose
twilight the scientists began to shiver and their
thoughts were distracted from the problem they
had been debating by the physical discomfort of
which thewere increasingly conscious

  they heard the coice of the strange manikin
in the dusk

  i can offer you a choice of shelters for the
night and also for the duration of your stay on
mars you will find the space-flier well-lighted
and warmed with all the facilities which you
may require also i can offer you another hos-
pitality look beneath my foliage a little to
your right where i am now preparing a shelter
no less commodious and comfortable than the
vessel-a shelter which will help to give you an
idea of my varied powers and potentialities
the earth-men saw that the flier was brilliant-
ly illuminated pouring out a gorgeous amethys-
tine radiance from its violet ports then be-
neath the foliage close at hand they perceived

another and stranger luminosity which seemed
to be emitted like some sort of radio-active or
noctilucent glow by the great leaves them-
selves

  even where they were standing they felt a
balmy warmth that began to temper the frigid
air and stepping toward the source of these
phenomena they found that the crowded leaves
had lifted and arched themselves into a roomy
alcove the ground beneath was lined with a
fabric-like substance of soft hues deep and elas-
tic underfoot like a fine mattress ewers filled
with liquids and platters of food-stuffs were dis-
posed on low tables and the air in the alcove
was gentle as that of the spring night in a sub-
tropic land

  gaillard and the other pro martians filled
with profound awe and wonder were ready to
avail themselves at once of the shelter of this
thaumaturgic hostelry but the anti-martians
would have none of it regarding it as the work-
manship of the devil suffering keenly from the
cold with chattering teeth and shivering limbs
they promenaded the open glade for some time
and at last were driven to seek the hospitable
port of the space-flier thinking it the lesser of
two evils by some queer twist of logic

  the others after eating and drinking from
the mysteriously provided tables laid themselves
down on the mattress-like fabrics they found
themselves greatly refreshed by the liquid in the
ewers which was not water but some kind of
roseate aromatic wine the food a literal man-
na was more agreeably flavored than that of
which they had partaken during their voyage
in the space-vessel

  in the nerve-wrought and highly excited state
that was consequent upon their experiences
none of them had expected to sleep the un-
familiar air the altered gravity the unknown
radiations of the exotic soul as well as their un-
precendented journey and the miraculous dis-
coveries and revelations of the day were all pro-
foundly upsetting and conductive to a severe dis-
equilibration of mind and body

  however gaillard and his companions fell
into a deep and dreamless slumber as soon as
they had laid themselves down perhaps the
liquid and solid refreshments which they had
taken may have conduced to this or perhaps
there was some narcotic or mesmeric influence
in the air falling from the vast leaves or pro-
ceeding from the brain of the plant-lord

  the anti-martians did not fare so well in this
respect and their slumber was restless and
broken most of them had touched the proffered
viands in the space-flier very sparingly and
stilton in particular had refused to eat or drink
at all doubtless too their antagonistic frame
of mind was such as to make them more resistant
to the hypnotic power of the plant if such were
being exerted at any rate they did not share
in the benefits conferred upon the others

  a little before dawn when mars was still
shrouded in crepuscular gloom but slightly
lightened by the two small moons phobos and
deimos stilton arose from the soft couch on
which he had tossed in night-long torment and
	wonder stories quarterly

began to experiment once more undeterred by
his previous failure and discomfiture with the
mechanical controls of the vessel

  to his surprise he found that the odd-shaped
keys wereon longer resistant to his fingers he
could move and arrange them at will and he
soon discovered the principle of their working
and was able to leviate and steer the flier

  his confreres had now joined him summoned
by his shout of triumph all were wide-awake
and jubilant with the wild hope of escaping from
mars and the jurisdiction of the plant-monster
thrilling with this hope and fearing every mo-
ment that the martian would re-assert its esoteric
control of the mechanism they rose unhindered
from the darkling glade to the alien skies and
headed toward the brilliant green orb of earth
descried among the unfamiliar constellations

  looking back they saw the vast eyes of the
martian watching them weirdly from the gloom
like pools of clear and bluish phosphorescence
and they shuddered with the dread of being re-
called and re-captured but for some inscrut-
able reason they were permitted to maintain
their earthward course without interference

however the voyage was fraught with a
certain amount of disaster and stiltons
clumsy pilotage hardly formed an ample substi-
tute for the half-divine knowledge and skill of
the martian more than once the vessel collided
with meteors none of which fortunately were
heavy enough to penetrate its hull and when
after many hours they approached th earth
stilton failed to sfecure the proper degree of de-
celeration the flier fell with terrible precipi-
tancy and was saved from destruction only by
dropping into the south atlantic the jarred
mechanism was rendered unworkable by the fall
and most of the occupants were severely bruised
and stunned

  after floating at random for days the coppery
bulk was sighted by a northward-going liner and
was towed to port in lisbon here the scientists
abandoned it and made their way back to amer-
ica after detailing their adventures to represen-
tatives of the world-press and issuing a solemn
warning to all the world-peoples against the sub-
versive designs and infamous proposals of the
ultra-planetary monster

  the sensation created by their return and by
the news they brought was tremendous a
tide of profound alarm and panic due in part to
the immemorial human aversion toward the un-
known swept immediately upon the nations and
immense formless exaggerated fears were bred
like shadowy hydras in the dark minds of men

  stilton and his fellow-conservatives continued
to foster these fears and to create with their
pronouncements a globe-wide wave of anti-mar-
tian prejudice of blind opposition and dogmatic
animosity they enlisted on their side as many
of the scientific fraternity as they could that is
to say all those who were minded like them-
selves as well as others overawed or subdued by
the pressure of authority they sought also with
much success to marshal the political powers of
the world in a strong league that would ensure

the repudiation of any further offers of alliance
from the martian

  in all this gathering of inimical forces this
regimenting of earthly conservation and insular-
ity and ignorance the religious factor as was
inevitable soon asserted itself the claim to di-
vine knowledge and power made by the martian
was seized upon by all the various mundane
hierarchies by christian and muhammadan by
buddhist and parsee and voodoist alike as form
ing as supremely heinous blasphemy the im-
piety of such claims and the menace of a non-
anthropomorphic god and type of worship that
might be introduced on earth could not be tol-
erated for a moment khalif and pope lama
and imaum parson and mahatma all made com-
mon cause against this ultra-terrestrial invader

  also the reigning political powers felt that
there might be something bolshevistic behind
the offer of the martian to promote an utopian
state of society on earth and the financial com-
mercial and manufacturing interests likewise
thought that it might imply a threat to their wel-
fare or stability in short every branch of hu-
man life and activity was well represented in
the anti-martian movement

  in the interim on mars gaillard and his com-
panions had awakened from their sleep to find
that the luminous glow of the arching leaves had
given place to the ardent gold of morn they
discovered that they could venture forth with
comfort from the alcove for the air of the glade
without had grown swiftly warm beneath the
rising sun

  even before they had noticed the absence of
the coppery flier they were apprised of its de-
parture by the man-organ of the great plant this
being unlike its human prototypes was exempt
from fatigue and ft had remained standing or
reclining all night against the fleshy wall to
which it was attached it now addressed the
earth-men thus

  for reasons of my own i have made no at-
tempt to prevent the flight of your companions
who with their blindly hostile attitude would be
worse than useless to me and whose presence could
only hinder the rapport which should exist be-
tween you and myself they will reach the earth
and will try to warn its peoples against me and
to poison their minds against my beneficent offer
such an outcome alas cannot be avoided even
if i were to bring them back to mlrs or divert
their flight by means of my control and send
them speeding forever through the void beyond
the worlds i perceive that there is much ignor-
ance and dogmatism and blind self-interest to be
overcome before the excelling light which i prof-
fer can illumine the darkness of earthly minds

  after i have kept you here for a few days
and have instructed you thoroughly in the secrets
of my transcedent wisdom and have imbued
you with surprising powers that will serve to
demonstrate my omnivalent superiority to the na-
tions of earth i shall send you back to earth as
my ambassadors and though you will meet with
much opposition from your fellows my cause will
prevail in the end beneath the infallible suppbrt
of truth and science
the planet entity	

gaillard and the others received this com-
munication as well well as the many that
followed it with supreme respect and semi-
religious reverence more and more they became
convinced that they stood in the presence of a
higher and ampler entity than man that the in-
tellect which thus discoursed to them through
the medium of a human form was well-nigh in-
exhaustible in its range and depth and possessed
many characteristics of infinitude and more than
one attribute of deity

  agnostic though most of them were by nature
or training they began to accord a certain wor-
ship to this amazing plant-lord and they listened
with an attitude of complete submission if not
of abjection to the out-pourings of cycle-gath-
ered lore and immortal secrets of cosmic law
and life and energy in which the great being
proceeded to instruct them

  the illumination thus accorded them was both
simple and esoteric the plant-lord began by
dwelling at some length upon the monistic nature
of all phenomena of matter light color sound
electricity gravity and all other forms of irrad-
iation as well as time and space which it said
were only the various perceptual manifestations
of a single underlying principle or substance

  the listeners were then taught the evocation
and control by quite rudimentary chemical
media of many forces and rates of energy that
had hitherto lain beyond the detection of human
senses or instruments they were taught also
the terrific power obtainable by refracting with
certain sensitized elements the ultra-violet and
infra-red rays of the spectrum which in a high-
ly concentrated form could be used for the dis-
integration and re-building of the molecules of
matter

  they learned how to make engines that emitted
beams of destruction and transmutation and
also learned how to tap the illimitable and multi-
farious energies of the interspatial ether and
how to employ these unknown beams more pot-
ent even than the so-called cosmic rays in the
renewal of human tissues and the conquest of
disease and old age

   simultaneously with this tuition the plant-lord
carried on the building of a new space-car in
which the earth-men were to return to their own
planet and preach the martian evangel the
construction of this car whose plates and girders
seemed to materialize out of the void air before
their very gaze was a practical lesson in the use
of arcanic natural forces atoms that would
form the requisite alloys were brought together
from space by the play of invisible magnetic
beams were fused by concentrated solar heat in
a specially refractive zone of atmosphere and were
then moulded into the desired form as readily
as the bottle that shapes itself from the pipe of
the glass-blower

  equipped with this new knowledge and poten-
tial masterdom with a cargo of astounding
mechanisms and devices made for their use by
the plant-lord the pro-martians finally embarked
on their earthward voyage

chapter vi
the martians power

a week after the abduction of the thirty-
five earth-men from the stadium at berk-
eley the space-car containing the martians
proselytes landed at noon in this same stadium
beneath the infinitely skilful and easy control of
the far-off plant-being it came down without ac-
cident lightly as a bird and as soon as the news
of its arrival had spread it was surrounded by a
great throng in which the motives of hostility
and curiosity were almost equally paramount

  through the denunciation of the dogmatists
led by stilton the savants and the three reporters
beneath the leadership of gaillard had been in-
ternationally outlawed before their arrival it
was expected that they would return sooner or
later through the machinations of the plant-lord
and a special ruling that forbade them to land
on terrene soil under penalty of imprisonment
had been made by all the governments

  ignorant of this and ignorant also of how
wide-spread and virulent was the prejudice
against them they opened the vessels port and
stood in readiness to emerge

  gaillard going first paused at the head of
the metal stairway and something seemed to ar-
rest him as he looked down on the milling faces
of the mob that had gathered with incredible
swiftness he saw enmity fear hatred sus-
picion in many of these faces and in others a
gaping and zany-like inquisitiveness such as
might be shown before the freaks of some trav-
elling circus a small corps of policemen elbow-
ing and thrusting the rabble aside with officious
rudeness was pushing toward the front and
cries of derision and hatred gathering by two
and threes and uniting to a rough roar were
now hurled at the occupants of the car

  damn the pro-martians down with the dirty

traitors hang the---dogs

   an overripe tomato large and dripping sailed
toward gaillard and splashed on the steps at his
feet hisses and hoots and cat-calls added to the
roaring bedlam but above it all he and his com-
rades heard a quiet voice that spoke within the
car the voice of the martian borne across in-
estimable miles of ether

  beware and defer your landing resign
yourselves to my guidance and all will be well
gaillard stepped back as he heard this mina-
tory voice and the valvular port closed quickly
behind the folded stairs just as the policemen
who had come to arrest the vessels occupants
broke from the forefront of the throng

  peering out on those hateful faces gaillard
and his brother-savants beheld an astounding
manifestation of the martians power a wall
of violet flame descending from the remote heav-
ens to the ground seemed to intervene between
the car and the crowd and the policemen bruised
and breathless but uninjured were hurled back-
ward as if by a great wave

  this flame whose color changed to blue and
green and yellow and scarlet like a sort of aur-
ora played for hours about the vessel and ren-
	wonder stories quarterly

dered it impossible for anyone to approach re-
treating to a respectful distance awe-struck and
terrified the crowd looked on in silence and
the police waited in vain for a chance to fulfill
their commission

  after awhile the flame became white and
misty and upon it as upon the bosom of a cloud
a bizarre and mirage-like scene was imprinted
visible alike to the occupants of the car and the
throne without this scene was the martian
landscape in which the central brain of the plant-
lord was located and the crowd gasped with as-
tonishment as it met the gaze of the enormous
telescopic eyes and saw the unending stems and
league-wide masses of sempervirent foliage

  other scenes and demonstrations followed all
of which were calculated to impress upon the
throng the wonder-working powers and marvel-
lous faculties of this remote being

  pictures that illustrated the historic life of the
martian as well as the various arcanic natural
energies subject to its dominion followed each
other in rapid succession the purpose of the
desired alliance with earth and the benefits
which would accrue thereby to humanity were
also depicted the divine benignity and wisdom
of this puissant being its superior organic na-
ture and its vital and scientific supremacy were
made plain to the dullest observer

  many of those who had come to scoff or had
been prepared to receive the pro-martians and
their evangel with scorn and hate and violence
became converted to the alien cause forthwith by
these sublime demonstrations

  however the more dogmatic scientists the
true die-hards as represented by godfrey stil-
ton maintained an adamantine obstructionism
in which they were supported by the officers of
law and government as well as by the presbyters
of the various religions the world-wide dis-
sidence of opinion which soon resulted became
the cause of many civil wars or revolutions and
in one or two cases ended in actual warfare be-
tween nations

numerous efforts were made to apprehend
or destroy the martian space-car which be-
neath the guidance of its ultra-planetary master
peared in many localities all over the world de-
scending suddenly from the stratosphere to per-
form incredible scientific miracles before the eyes
of astonished multitudes in all quarters of tfte
globe the mirage-like pictures were flashed on
the screen of cloudy fire and more and more
people went over to the new cause

  bombing planes pursued the vessel and sought
to drop their deadly freight upon it but without
success for whenever the car was endangered
the auroral flames intervened deflecting and
hurling back the exploded bombs often to the de-
triment of their launchers

  gaillard and his confreres with leonine bold-
ness emerged many times from the car to dis-
play before crowds or selected bodies of savants
the marvellous inventions and chemical thauma-
turgies with which they had been endowed by
the martian everywhere the police sought to
arrest them maddened mobs endeavored to do

them violence armed regiments tried to sur-
round them and cut them off from the car but
with an adroitness that seemed no less than su-
pernatural they contrived always to elude cap-
ture and often they discomfited their pursuers
by astonishing displays or evocations of esoteric
force temporarily paralyzing the civic officers
with unseen rays or creating about themselves a
defensive zone of intolerable heat or trans-arctic
cold

  in spite of all these myriad demonstrations
however the citadels of human ignorance and
insularity remained impregnable in many places

  deeply alarmed by this ultra-terrene menace
to their stability the governments and religions
of earth as well as the more conservative scien-
tific elements rallied their resources in a most
heroic and determined effort to stem the incur-
sion men of all ages everywhere were con-
scripted for service in the national armies and
even women and children were equipped with
the deadliest weapons of the age for use against
the pro-martians who with their wives and fam-
ilies were classed as infamous renegades to be
hunted down and killed without ceremony like
dangerous beasts

  the internecine warfare that ensued was the
most terrible in human history class became
divided against class and family against family
new and more lethal gases than any heretofore
employed were devised by chemists and whole
cities or territories were smothered beneath their
agonizing pall others were blown into skyward-
flying fragments by single charges of super-
potent explosives and war was carried on by
planes by rocket-ships by submarine by dread-
naughts by tanks by every vehicle and engine
of death or destruction that the homicidal ingen-
uity of man had yet created

  the pro-martians who had won several vic-
tories at first were now gravely outnumbered
and the tide of battle began to turn against them
scattered in many lands they found themselves
unable to unite and organize their forces to the
same degree as those of their official opponents
though gaillard and his devoted confreres went
everywhere in the space-vessel aiding and abet-
ting the radicals and instructing them in the use
of new weapons and cosmic energies the party
suffered great reverses through the sheer brute
preponderance of its foes more and more it
became split up into small bands hunted and
harried and driven to seek refuge in the wilder
or less explored sections of the earth

  in north america however a large army of
the scientific rebels whose families had been
compelled to join them contrived to hold the
antagonists at bay for awhile surrounded at
last and faced by overwhelming odds this army
was on the verge of a crushing defeat

  gaillard hovering above the black volumin-
ous clouds of the battle in which poisonous gases
mingled with the fumes of high explosives felt
for the first time the encroachment of actual
despair it seemed to him and also to his com-
panions that the martian had abandoned them
disgusted perhaps with the bestial horror of it
the planet entity	 

all and the hateful purblind narrowness and
fanatic nescience of mankind

  then through the smoke-smothered air a
fleet of coppery-golden cars descended to land
on the battle-front among the martian adherents
there were thousands of these cars and from
all the entrance-ports which had opened simul-
taneously there issued the voice of the planet-
lord summoning its supporters and bidding them
enter the vessels

  saved from annihilation by this act of martian
providence the entire army obeyed the com-
ta-id and as soon as the last man woman and
child had gone aboard the ports closed again
and the fleet of space-cars wheeling in graceful
and derisive spirals above the heads of the baf-
fled conservatives soared from the battle-clouds
like a flock of reddish-golden birds and vanished
in the noon-tide heavens led by the car contain-
ing gaillards party

  at the same time in all portions of the world
where the little bands of heroic radicals had been
cut off and threatened with capture or destruc-
tion other cars descended in like manner and
carried away the pro-martians and their families
even to the last unit these vessels joined the
main fleet in mid-space and then all continued
their course beneath the mysterious piloting of
the plant-lord flying at super-cosmic velocity
through the star-surrounded gulf

contrary to the anticipations of the mun-
dane exiles the vessels were not drawn to-
ward mars and it soon became evident that
their objective was the planet venus the voice
of the martian speaking athwart the eternal
ether made the following announcement

  in my infinite wisdom my supreme forepre-
science i have removed you from the hopeless
struggle to establish on earth the sovereign light
and truth which i offer you alone i have found
worthy and the moiety of mankind who have
refused salvation with hatred and contumely
preferring the natal darkness of death and dis-
ease and ignorance in which they were born
must be left henceforward to their inevitable
fate

  you as my loyal and well-trusted servants i
am sending forth to colonize beneath my tutelage
a great continent on the planet venus and to
found amid the primal exuberance of this new
world a super-scientific nation

  the fleet soon approached venus and circled
the equator for a great distance in the steam-
thick atmosphere through which nothing could
be descried other-than a hot and over-fuming
ocean close to the boiling-point which seemed
to cover the entire planet here beneath the
never-setting sun intolerable temperatures pre-
vailed everywhere such as would have parboiled
the flesh of a human being exposed directly
to the semi-aqueous air suffering even in their
insulated cars from this terrific heat the exiles
wondered how they were to exist in such a world

  at least however their destination came in
view and their doubts were resolved nearing
the nightward side of venus which is never ex-
posed to daylight in a latitude where the sun

slanted far behind them as over arctic realms
they beheld through thinning vapors an immense
tract of land the sole continent amid the plane-
tary sea this continent was covered by rich
jungles containing a flora and fauna similar to
those of pre-glacial eras on the earth calami-
tes and cycads and fern-plants of unbelievable
luxuriance revealed themselves to the earth-men
and they saw everywhere the great brainless
reptiles the megalosaurs plesiosaurs labyrinth-
odons and pterodactyls of jurassic times

  beneath the instruction of the martian before
landing they slew these reptiles incinerating
them completely with infra-red beams so that
not even their carcasses would remain to taint the
air with putrefactive effluvia when the whole
continent had been cleared of its noxious life
the cars descended and emerging the colonists
found themselves in a terrain of unequalled fer-
tility whose very soil seemed to pulsate with
primordial vigors and whose air was rich with
ozone and oxygen and nitrogen

  here the temperature though still sub-tropic
was agreeable and balmy and through the use
of protective fabrics provided by the martian the
earth-men soon accustomed themselves to the
eternal sunlight and intense ultra-violet radia-
tion with the super-knowledge at their dis-
posal they were able to combat the unknown
highly pernicious bacteria peculiar to venus and
even to exterminate such bacteria in the course
of time they became the lords of a salubrious
climate dowered with four mild and equable
seasons by the slight annual rotation of the
planet but having one eternal day like the
mythic isles of the blest beneath a low and un-
departing sun

  beneath the leadership of gaillard who re-
mained in close rapport and continual communi-
cation with the plant-lord the great forests were
cleared in many places cities of lofty and
ethereal architecture lovely as those of some
transstellar eden builded by the use of force-
beams began to rear their graceful turrets and
majestic cumuli of domes above the gigantic
calamites and ferns

  through the labors of the terrene exiles a
truly utopian nation was established giving al-
legiance to the plant-lord as to some tutelary
deity a nation devoted to cosmic progress to
scientific knowledge to spiritual tolerance and
freedom a happy law-abiding nation blest with
millenial longevity and exempt from sorrow and
disease and error

  here too on the shores of the venusian sea
were builded the great transmitters that sent
through interplanetary space in ceaseless wave
of electronic radiation the water required to
replenish the dehydrated air and soil of mars
and thus to ensure for the plant-being a perpet-
uity of god-like existence

  in the meanwhile on earth unknown to gail-
lard and his fellow-exiles who had made no ef-
fort to communicate with the abandoned world
an amazing thing had occurred a final proof of
the virtual omnipotence and all-inclusive
sapience of the martian

buitrattoo by uarchioni

   i stopped dead a figure was seated at the receiving set it was a thing
   utterly grotesque and horrible

   
the e-my own com-
mand-had arrived back
on earth on one of its all
too infrequent visits only a day
or so previously and as the
ship was due for re-fitting i was looking forward
to a reasonably long leave with my family
of the interplanetary guard-
that autocratic body which is
responsible for the smooth run-
ning of traffic and the mainten-
ance of law and order in the
void between the worlds-find
our vacations all too few and
far between needless to say
when they come we endeavor
to enjoy them to the utmost
for ours is a hazardous life
even in these days when peace
has descended on the planets
and the forces of disruption no
longer threaten to put an end
to our existence

  but the weeks of slippered
ease i had pictured were not to
materialise the gods of the
spaceways had ruled other-
wise

  the first intimation i had of
visitors was when
i heard the faint
warning blare of a
private aero-cars
siren as the mach-
ine prepared to
descend o n the
landing stage
above our roof and
some queer instinct
warned me that
the call was for us
rather than for
any other inhabi-
tants of our block

 jansca and i
heard the sound to-
gether and she
looked at me with
a vague disquiet in
her eyes she al-
ways fears these
midnight visits for
usually they mean
hurried journeys
risk and trouble
for all concerned

  i wonder who
it is she said as
though she fancied
i might have half an idea already as a matter
of fact i had though i was loth to put it into
words

  we were not kept long in doubt a minute
or so later the entrance bell twinkled and a face
glowed in the vision plate set on the table beside
the televox

  harran i ejaculated come in and i

pressed the button that woifl
give him admittance present-
ly i heard his footsteps come
clattering down-the elevator
was not working at this hour
of the night-and he entered the room peeling
off his gloves as he came

  good evening mrs san-
ders how do jack he
greeted us phew but its a
cold night up above

  cold i said one could
hardly imagine that in this
cozy cheerful room come
over near the radiator and get
yourself warm

  he came yes its cold
enough up above he went on
and likely to remain so if the
weather people are to be be-
lieved all the same im
afraid jack that ive got hot
work for you

   what is it i asked in my
normal voice though im afraid
my heart sank

  somethings gone wrong
out on the asteroid belt he
returned with a side glance at
jansca weve
been getting all
sorts of unintelli-
gible signals
through gibberish
no less we cant
make head or tail
of it weve called
up both pallas and
vesta used earth
english tlananian
martian and the
open code but all
we can get in reply
is a jumble of
strange sounds
but you can under-
stand better what
im driving at if
you hear them
yourself ive had
a disk made and
brought it along
with me got your
talk - machine
handy

   i drew it towards
us and he extract
ed a thin disk from
its case in his inner
pocket fixed it on the machine and started the
works we listened in silence awed a little i
must admit by the medley of sound that filled
the room there was a certain odd puking
rhythm in it that somehow made me feel it was
the work of sentient creatures yet on the oth-
er hand it sounded like the product of a mad-
man or an ape the odd thing about it was that

the struggle for pallas

by the author of
vandals of the void

we

j m walsh

 to introduce this story-sequel to the marve-
 lous vandals of the void-we can do no
 better than to quote the introduction of the
 author

   almost from the first he says the early
 interplanetary expeditions proved conclusively
 the error of those who held that life was possible
 only on our own particular planet

   we know now that life is the most persistent
 thing in the universe true the dominant in-
 telligence on other worlds is not always that to
 which we are accustomed often it is oddly
 even repulsively alien to us of the inner planets
 where conditions being much the same life has
 evolved upon somewhat similar lines

    but it is life and with the recognition of that
 we have reached a more cautious stage we no
 longer dare assert that any planetary body is
 unfit for habitation all we can say in the case
 of those we have not yet thoroughly explored is
 that they may not be capable of supporting the
 existence of beings similar to ourselves

   mr walsh has stated his thesis here and in
 the exciting story he brings his ideas to us for-
 cibly


wonder stories quarterly

from first to last none of us there in the room
had the least doubt that it was a language-or
dialect call it what you will-of some sort
it certainly was no mere fortuitous jumble of
sounds

  i shivered as the disk was finished and the
sounds ceased a sense of chill foreboding crept
over me

  well what do you think of it harran ask-
ed looking from me to jansca and then back
again

  i dont quite know what to make of it i
said truthfully enough what do you think

  harran spread his hands in a curiously alien
gesture thats what we want you to find out
he said and for a start im going to forestall
your objections by telling you that it comes from
pallas-theres no doubt of that-and similar
sounds have been picked up from vesta im
afraid well have to ask you to take off in e
at the earliest possible moment and make inves-
tigation we cant have communication inter-
rupted in this way and if anything has really
gone wrong on pallas it may have its repercus-
sions throughout the planets unless we get it
righted at once

  why not send one of the martian guard-
ships i queried mars is nearer at present

  pallas isnt martian territory harran point-
ed out you must remember weve an earth
settlement there of very touchy people at that
we dont want any interplanetary complications
on our hands at present and you know as well
as i do that the colonists on pallas are just the
sort to make them if they get half a chance

there was sound sense in that i knew all
and more than he could tell me about the
inhabitants of that particular asteroid rever-
sionists we called them trouble-makers we knew
them to be they were men and women who on
our own planet had spent their time plotting and
planning to bring back the bad old days of
national boundaries and national hates that had
been ended we hoped for ever when the world
federation came into being anachronisms some
thought them who believed that mankinds high-
est function was to war against whomsoever dif-
fered from them in creed color or language
and since this queer old earth of ours had suf-
fered enough from them in the past and we had
no mind to see the bad old conditions brought
back again we had collected all who would not
sign a bond to cease their subversive activities
and had marooned them on pallas mars had
done the same with her irreconcilables estab-
lishing them on vesta only lucky venus of
the three inner planets had no need to do any
such thing the venusians from time immemor-
ial have been of one race one nation with one
language

  and now it seemed that on the earth colony
scarcely yet a year old trouble had already
broken out perhapb having no one else to quar-
rel with they had started bickering amongst
themselves though that did not explain the

strange sounds harran claimed to have record-
ed clearly it was a matter that demanded in-
vestigation only on the point of whether i
should do it myself i did not see eye to eye with
my chief

  once before a vacation of mine had been in-
terrupted though out of that had come the great-
est fortune of my life i could not hope this
time for any similar good luck i was not mind-
ed to try

  why not i said send one of the guard-
ships from a patrol out in space surely there
is at least one that could make pallas in half the-
time that we can from here

  there are several harran returned with a
twinkle in his eye but the point is jack that
they may not be fully equipped to meet any
emergency some of them have been out nearly
the year and their supplies must be running low
on the other hand we can put off the overhaul of
e and have her back in commission ready to
take to space inside twenty-four hours she
must go though of course your second can take
her out if youre afraid of going

  that clinched it his last words flicked me on
the raw as he meant them to do

  its not reluctance in the sense you seem to
think i snapped only ive just started va-
cation-i glanced at jansca-and its hard to
have to take to space again at almost a moments
notice when id been looking forward to weeks
of ease

  i know i know he said softly but jack
mrs sanders both of you i promise double time
when this business is over and done with on
top of that you may make contact with the men
of mars if our friends on pallas have been mak-
ing any trouble with them youre the man to
smooth it over no doubt youll find a martian
man no harder to manage than you do a lady of
that same world

  he smiled happily at jansca-once a dirka and
a native of the red planet itself-and she smiled
in return at the compliment clumsy as it was
she read too the unspoken thought behind the
words and answered it as he wished it answered

  yes he can go mr harran she said i at
least will put no obstacles in his way that he
comes back safely is all i ask

  twenty four hours later exactly at midnight
e lifted from the slips and headed out into
space of the voyage itself there is little to re-
cord we encountered no adventures and met
with no mishaps on the way since the night i
had seen harran no further word had come from
any of the inhabited asteroids communication
of all sorts had ceased entirely and abruptly af-
ter that medley of strange sounds had come
through

  frankly i did not know what to make of it
had the reversionists risen against our guards
and seized the power-stations we would at least
have expected word of it to have got through
some urgent call for help perhaps or failing
that the reversionists themselves were the type
of people whom one would quite expect to send
some messages of defiance they would be only
too eager to do this and would probably welcome
the struggle for pallas

the opportunity of asserting as they termed it
their independence but nothing of the sort had
occurred

  of course we speculated amongst ourselves
some saying one thing and some another but
none of us in our wildest dreams suspected what
had actually happened

  we came at last to pallas a world in miniature
in some ways a replica of our own earth fifty
years ago it would have been declared uninhabit-
able a bleak and barren waste with an atmos-
phere too tenuous to support life as we knew it
today after less than a year of intensive settle-
ment it is capable of maintaining a reasonably
large population

the cohorts of the damned

some if not most of the credit for the trans-
formation must go to the martian scien-
tists the conditions prevalent on their own
overcrowded and not very productive planet had
sharpened their initiative so that early on they
had learned to assist nature and on occasion
spur her on to further efforts because of the
magnitude of the task on their home planet they
had met with only partial success but here on
the smaller bulks of the asteroids they had been
able to achieve their aims with greater ease
ceres they had turned into a veritable garden
vesta had become barely habitable and pallas
in a condition somewhere between the two how-
ever it is not my business to linger over these
achievements here except in so far as mention
of them and the slight climatic changes they in-
volved are necessary to make my story intelligi-
ble

  for some time we had had the surface of the
asteroid under observation but our electro-tele-
scope failed to reveal anything of an interesting
or disturbing nature knowing the advantage
of a surprise arrival i presently altered our course
so that we would approach the asteroid on the
night side

  i suppose i should have realized from the first
that if one thing had gone wrong almost every-
thing was sure to be in much the same state but
ill own that it was with a sense of shock i dis-
covered that the beams from the light pylons
which under the interplanetary traffic code must
be kept alight all night in all circumstances were
not showing neither were there any lights vis-
ible in the few small cities pallas boasted i
think it was then it dawned on me that the sit-
uation might be far more serious than any of us
even harran had imagined

  no lights meant no power and no power could
only mean that the members of the guard who
had been left in charge were no longer at their
posts but the guards stay until they are reliev-
ed or death overtakes them and since the latter
was seemingly the only possible explanation it
followed logically that they had been killed but
in that case-supposing the reversionists had
been the aggressors-why were there no lights
showing in the cities they would hardly be
foolish enough to imagine that by keeping their
homes in darkness they could escape retribution

  idle speculation an hours investigation was
worth a day

  we circled pallas spiralling in ever-narrow-
ing circles that gradually brought us closer to the
surface of the asteroid until at length we ground-
ed gently on a grassy upland just as the day was
breaking in that part of the world not know-
ing what we might have to face i had air tests
made before i dared allow the ports to be opened
the tests however showed nothing abnormal in
the air so cautiously we opened the exit ports

  the cold air whipped in air colder than we
were used to on most of earth and thin enough
to our ways of thinking yet there was a brac-
ing quality in it that made up for a lot of what
it lacked in other ways

  we stepped out walking gingerly because of
the slighter gravity pull of this tiny world every-
thing seemed quiet and peaceful the guards
power-station on the cliffs behind us-perhaps
half a mile away-showed no sign of life a
queer thing that they must have seen us land
one would have thought they would have been
frantically eager to meet and greet us

  it was at that precise moment while the lit-
tle landing party i had detailed stood indecisive
waiting for my orders that someone caught sight
of the running man more correctly he was leap-
ing coming towards us with great strides bound-
ing yards at a time in a way that showed he was
not wearing the gravity adjustment shoes an
earthman a guard also for the sky-blue uni-
form stained and torn though it was was plain-
ly visible in the wan sunlight of the early morn-
ing

  some of us ran towards him and he fell sob-
bing into our midst one of our men recognized
him its bahn he said i know him i was
on e with him

  but bahn did not recognise his erstwhile com-
rade did not know any of us even as guards
all he seemed to know if indeed he knew any-
thing was that he was among friends whether
his mind was utterly unhinged we could not say
but for the time at least he behaved like an man
bereft of his senses

  his uniform as i have said was stained and
torn it seemed to have been ripped by some-
thing sharp like claws more than that the
piping of his jacket facings that had once been
white were dyed with blood blood scarcely dry
but whether his own or not we could not say at
least he did not appear to be wounded later we
found that save for some scratches he was un-
harmed but the oddest thing of all was the
curiously fetid odor that seemed to cling to him

  we plied him with questions but could get
no sensible answer only a vacant stare with a
hint of terror behind it and an incoherent mut-
tering boland the man who claimed his ac-
quaintance tried hard to strike a glimmer of
reason from him but could get nothing in reply
but a stream of meaningless babble in which two
phrases alone seemed to have any intelligible
connection with each other something about
the lost ones and then another phrase that
kept constantly recurring the cohorts of the
damned
wonder stories quarterly

  it was not an unfaifiiliar phrase to me i recog-
nized it as one from an early twentieth century
poet still popular enough with men of action
though in this instance i failed to see its precise
application unless it was some contemptuous
reference to the reversionists though that i did
not think at all likely

ti e cant do anything with him its hope-

  w less trying to make sense of his words
yet i said boland you know him best you
should have most hope of success with him take
him to the sick bay and look after him pity we
didnt bring a doctor with us but if you look up
the emergency medicine chest you may find some-
thing to treat his particular case

  i dont fancy its a doctor he needs sir
boland answered but he was on his way with
his charge before i could ask him what he meant

  clearly the guards power-station should be
our first port of call bahn had come from there
running from a terror that might after all ex-
ist only in his own mind but in case it did not
it behooves us to go cautiously

  i gave my second in command careful and de-
tailed instructions and arranged so that the ray
projectors from the ship should cover our ad-
vance-and our retreat too if that became nec-
essary

  we had brought the ship as near to the cliffs
as was consistent with safety and the ability to
take off in a hurry but on this small world the
intervening distance mattered little even to men
on foot inside ten minutes we were scaling the
path up to the heights at first there seemed no
sign of anything wrong save that the place was
silent and deserted and doors that should have
been shut were swinging idly on their hinges

  then too i missed the familiar hum of the
power-generating machinery that supplied the
asteroid with light and heat it struck me then
that the bite in the air and the thinness of the
atmosphere was no doubt due to that very fact
if the machinery were not started again in quick
time we might lose all we had gained in the year
and have pallas slipping back into its former
bare bleak desolate state

  from the top of the cliffs we could see across
the plain to the neighboring city of clion a place
of some five thousand inhabitants and the chief
town of pallas its roof tops glittered in the sun
but save for the fact that it had a curiously de-
serted appearance we could at first see nothing
out of the ordinary then what i had taken to
be a shimmer in the air resolved itself into a
wisp of smoke it thickened as we watched seem-
ed curiously shot with tongues of flame

  but that could wait the guards quarters
were our immediate concern

we entered into the main room where com-
munication between the planets was maintained

  i was leading but i stopped dead on the thres-
hold with a stifled exclamation and an odd feel-
ing of horror constricting my throat a figure
was seated at the receiving set head-phones over
its ears and fingers straying over the bank of
keys in front of it

for the moment so utterly unprepared was i

for what i saw i imagined it must have been a
guard it was not it was a thing so utterly
grotesque and horrible that i can scarcely find
words to describe it it was a biped of sorts
though it seemed to be covered with some kind
of bark-like scales its feet ended in claws its
fingers were hook-like

  one of our men exclaimed at the sight the
creature must have had remarkably quick hear-
ing for it turned in a flash baleful green eyes
stabbing at us like heat-rays we recoiled in
horror it was the gargoyle of the medieval
world come to life only a hundred times more
horrible and more intelligent-looking than any-
thing the mind of man had ever conceived

  i raised my pencil ray tube and pressed the
button the tiny ray stabbed out and impinged
on the creatures breast there came a little
puff of smoke and a queer fetid odor but beyond
that the thing seemed unharmed its next move
was made so quickly that it caught us almost un-
prepared

  of a sudden it seemed to launch itself from the
sitting position it occupied a flapping of leath-
ery wings filled the air and sharp claws grazed
my uplifted wrist slight as was the scratch it
made the wound burnt like liquid fire and it had
the queer effect of temporarily paralyzing the
muscles of my injured arm

  and at that confusion broke out  one of the
men screamed horribly and on top of that there
came a queer insane jabbering of sound that in
itself had power to fill us with a chill horror i
recognized it instantly once heard it could
never be forgotten the same sounds as these
had come from the disk on which harran had
recorded the calls from pallas

  in some way i could not understand others
of the things had joined the fray perhaps they
had been sleeping in dark corners of the room
or had poured through the other doors at the
cry from their mate i do not know the air
was too filled with noise with the searing blasts
of pencil ray-tubes and acrid puffs of smoke for
one to see anything at all distinctly

the coming of the things

i did the only thing possible yelled for the
men to get out in the open where at least we
could see and would have the protection of the
ships immensely stronger armament we
streamed through the door the flying things
flapping heavily after us for some reason they
did not seem to be able to move so swiftly out as
they had indoors and that i imagine was our
salvation perhaps the difference in tempera-
ture between the comparatively warm room and
the cold air of the open affected them adversely
again i say i do not know i can only record
things as they happened

  we drew away scampering down the cliff
path the things flopping after us even then
they seemed to be gaining on us by degrees my
arm hurt intolerably i stumbled and almost
fell one of the men tried to help me but i
shook him off look after yourself i cried
make the ship
the struggle for pallas

  i had time to say no more the cohorts of
the damned-fitting name indeed for them-
were thickening the sky now there seemed no
end to their numbers and later i learnt that
they were joined about this time by reinforce-
ments streaming from the burning city of clion
half a dozen of them-it might readily have
been a hundred from the way it felt-dropped
down on me and the man who had come to my
assistance i fell underneath perhaps it was
that that saved me but my companion screamed
like a man in torment and then i think i must
have fainted partly from the effects of the
scratch on my arm and partly from the nauseous
stench that filled the air

  i came back to myself abruptly aware i was
no longer on the ground in a little i began to
understand what had happened my second-
glenn vance-had seen the conflict from the
ship had immediately lifted and come to our
rescue only just in time barely half a dozen
of the little party i had led out had survived i
myself lay on the ground and at first they thought
i was dead the things must have thought so
too otherwise how can i explain why they left
me untouched

  the es armament finally disposed of the
horde of attackers yet vance told me they seem-
ed almost impervious to the heat rays and it
was only when the disintegrator jets were turn-
ed on them that we were able to clean them up

  how long i have been like this   asked

  the better part of twenty-four hours he told
me he had other news too bahn the man
we had rescued had recovered sufficiently to be
able to give some sort of an account of himself
the toxic effect of the many scratches he had
received-they seemed temporarily to unhinge
the mind-had now worn off

  his story began with the discovery some six
earth months previously of a number of leath-
ery-looking eggs in one of the fields the electric
plows were tilling no one worried very much
about them even when in the artificially induced
warmth of the asteroid they rapidly hatched out
some new queer animal a survival from prehis-
toric times was what the guards thought and
so used were they to the myriad forms of grot-
esque life that our discoveries are bringing to
light in the universe that they considered they
had merely added another to the swiftly growing
list of odd but harmless monstrosities the re-
versionists however developed a genuine dislike
of the things and it was from them that the name
cohorts of the damned originally came

   still there was no one to tell the inhabitants of
pallas that for once a newly-discovered form of
life held in itself the possible seeds of destruc-
tion of the human colony on the asteroid the
things grew marvellously quickly and their in-
telligence apparently increased with their phys-
ical growth in a little over three months from
the time of their hatching they were full grown

 first they became a nuisance then a source of
irritation but the actual menace of them did not
appear until it was too late to combat it

  incredible as it may seem to earthmen who are
used to looking on man as the dominant species

the fact seems to be now fully established that
these things were quite our equals in intelli-
gence given the time and opportunity they
might readily have built up a civilization of sorts
on pallas certain of our scientists who have
since given attention to the matter are of the
opinion that the eggs from which these creatures
were hatched may have been millions of years
old that perhaps they dated back to the days
when pallas and the other asteroids formed part
of the planet that seems once to have swung in
the orbit between mars and jupiter

  imagine if you like an oviparous race capable
of reaching certain heights of intelligence and
civilization a race perhaps that once peopled
this long-exploded planet and then dominated
all other forms of life whether the survival of
the eggs through the countless succeeding ages
were the result of accident or design probably
we shall never know i myself lean to the latter
theory i have seen the things and fought with
them and i know how quickly they managed to
discover the uses of our machines and operate
themselves

  given another month or so of delay and we
might have arrived to find pallas a hostile world
with an alien race firmly entrenched behind the
barriers we ourselves had built up but i am
straying

the destruction of pharon

the blow when it came fell so suddenly that
it took everyone by surprise the guards
were overpowered and killed and in many cases
their own weapons were turned on them from
the numbers of the creatures that appeared
bahn thinks that more of them than we guessed
had been reared in secret in the caverns with
which the cliffs of pallas were honeycombed and
their existence was not suspected until the hordes
were let loose to swamp us i can well credit
it

  bahn alone of the guards was spared in some
way the creatures must have learned that he was
the one person best qualified to teach them the
secrets of our power apparatus that they had
not yet been able to discover for themselves they
made it plain by some sign language that that
was the sole condition of his continued existence
since there was nothing else for it he did as he
was bade he watched his chance in the hope
that he might be able to get some message
through to earth but evidently they suspected
his intention for the opportunity never came he
was surprised to learn that we had succeeded
in recording any transmission at all he seem-
ed to think that the sounds we received were sent
more by accident than of set design myself
i am not so sure of that

  one day he was surprised to notice that the
needle of the instrument which recorded the near
approach of a space-ship was moving in the
wonted manner the creatures themselves ap-
parently did not understand what this implied
and the chances were that they were not able
then to conceive of physical communication be-
tween worlds at any rate they displayed no
wonder stories quarterly

interest at all in the queer behaviour of the
needle on this particular dial bahn waited how-
ever until the instrument showed we had landed
in the vicinity he would have liked to have
learned more about us first but he dared not use
the television apparatus

  his one thought was that he must get to us at
once the knowledge that we were near lent
him the courage of desperation seizing the
moment when he was left alone in the room with
only one of the creatures awake to watch him
he suddenly sprang up swung the heavy metal
chair in which he had been sitting above his
head and brought it down across the face of the
other he could not hope to kill it thus but he
succeeded in temporarily disabling it blood
spurted from its mouth and face over him and
it groped blindly after him

  he did not wait but flung open the door and
rushed into a press of the creatures before he
could pull himself up the very impetus of his
rush carried him through but in the process he
was scratched clawed and bitten and apparently
enough of the toxic element lurking in their
claws and fangs to temporarily madden a dozen
men was injected into his blood the miracle of
it is that he recovered so quickly what hap-
pened after his mad dash from the room he could
not say the next he knew was when he came
back to normal to find himself in our company

  and the rest of pallas i asked

  he knew nothing of that whether the re-
versionists had been wiped out completely and
the creatures had succeeded in establishing their
dominion over part of the surface or not he could
not say vance however was able to tell me
that clion had gone up in smoke seemingly
there was not an earthman left alive in the city
and since it was hopeless to attempt to combat
the fire he had not tried he was now awaiting
my orders as to what should be done next

  theres only one thing to do i said the
chances are that the things are in possession of
the greater part of pallas its our business to
find out if they are the sooner we clean them
up the better

  its going to be a task vance said

  quite likely one that may even seem im-
possible but weve orders to right whatever was
wrong here and we cant think of leaving until
weve done the best of which were capable we
will start cruising at once

  vance saluted and left me not a bad fellow
though too prone to see difficulties before they
arrived he was at his best as a man of action
he could take his orders and carry them out
well

  slowly we circled the asteroid its swift rota-
tion seemingly bringing day and night in rapid
succession of the eight cities of pallas we found
six including clion had been destroyed most
probably by accident all of them had been
burned and since as we learned the creatures
did not understand fire and even had a pro-
nounced horror of it it hardly seemed likely that
they could have set the cities alight of deliber-
ate intention at the seventh city pharon we
found the inhabitants augmented by refugees

from the farm lands they had congregated in-
to some of the big public buildings and barred
and barricaded themselves against the assaults
of the creatures and so far had managed to
survive we learned from them however that
an attack in force was being prepared and that
they expected it would be merely a matter of
days before it took place a spy they had sent
out in a one-man surface flyer had cruised over
gonda the city we had not yet visited and had
picked up some items of interest

the most significant was that a small space-
ship apparently a private craft of martian
design had landed near gonda in a crippled con-
dition the things had swarmed over it killed
the crew and taken possession of the machine
the spy had been a witness of the tragedy and
he declared would have taken a chance and
blown the whole crowd out of existence had he
had any weapons he said this with something
of sullenness in his tone and i guessed he was
smarting under a sense of injustice

  i myself have never been one of those who
would deny the reversionists weapons with
which to protect themselves true there was
always the possibility that they might fall to
fighting amongst themselves or even turn their
weapons on us but in this universe of ours one
must take chances occasionally

  since gonda looked like the focal point of
this festering wound which seemed like to poison
the asteroid we headed direct for that city we
came within sight of it somewhere about the mid-
day hour and all of us were immediately struck
by the contrast it presented with the other seven
cities it was a hive of activity no less no part
of it had been destroyed the machines were
working the local power station was maintaining
an equilibrium of temperature for many miles
around had it not been for the heavy flopping
gargoyle-like figures flitting about amongst the
roof-tops and the sight of similar shapes moving
about the city streets i should have fancied that
gonda was still in possession of our own folk
a number of small surface-flyers-so called to
differentiate them from the space-ships-were
circling above the city

  the creatures had made good use of their time
apparently in so short a space they had fam-
iliarized themselves with the mechanism of so
many of our machines and mastered their intri-
cacies

  the people of pharon had informed us that
no earth-men were left in the city and that at
any rate simplified our task mankind and the
creatures it was evident could not exist side by
side one or the other must go and it was the
knowledge of that that steeled me to the course
of wholesale destruction that i believed was the
only course we could take it was sad to have
to destroy the result of so much labor but only
by razing the city to the ground could our pur-
pose be accomplished

  our heat-ray projectors were turned on the
city and presently the buildings began to melt
and run but long before that stage had been
reached the creatures had become aware of our
the struggle for pallas

presence and quite a number of the small fly-
ers ascended to attack us they were like gnats
small vicious but not very harmful neverthe-
less they could make quite a nuisance of them-
selves and since we did not know what new
weapons they might possess i thought it best
to place ourselves beyond their reach

  ordinarily i would have had no hesitation in
wiping them out at once with our disintegrator
rays but the trouble with the d-ray is that used
on a wholesale scale it is capable of doing whole-
sale damage the power necessary to wipe that
mosquito fleet entirely out of existence might
well blast the whole of the countryside beneath
us and render the greater part of pallas sterile
for a generation to come on the other hand
picking each separate machine off with a heat-
ray was a tedious task

  i took the only possible alternative lifted the
e out beyond the limits of atmosphere and
increasing our power continued the work of de-
struction from there the thing itself would not
have happened had we been at all alert our
excuse must be that our whole attention was
fixed on the world beneath us

  the first intimation that anything was wrong
came when of a sudden we became conscious
of a lowered air pressure a considerable diffi-
culty in breathing and a feeling of weakness and
nausea began to assail us vance grasped the
situation quicker than i did perhaps some of the
toxin lingering still in my blood rendered my
brain sluggish

  he sprang to the alarm-bells and rang the
signal through to close all the air-tight bulkheads
these acted automatically

  quick he called someone turn on the oxy-
gen containers

  one of the men obeyed there came a hissing
sound and the air grew breathable again

  what is it i queried

  weve been holed somewhere i should imag-
ine he said im ordering the repair gang to
go over the ship in their space-suits and see where
the damage is perhaps weve hit a small me-
terorite one no larger than a pea would be big
enough to puncture us

  the damage was located quickly enough
something-meteorite or not-had gone through
the nose of the craft putting the locators out of
action and making a hole large enough to cause
considerable trouble had we not discovered it
so soon

  i went along to inspect it and found vance
staring at it it was not a clean-drilled hole such
as one would expect a meteorite to have made
it was jagged at the edges and when i looked
for a corresponding hole across the compartment
i could find none it was queer i thought i
said as much to vance

  he nodded it looks more like an explosion
he said as though something in the nature of
an explosive bullet had burst on impact you
know the kind of thing some of the martian
guard-ships use them-sort of space torpedoes-
in conjunction with an anti-gravitational beam

  that was much what it looked like but the
suggestion merely seemed to remove us further

from a satisfactory explanation there was no
possibility of such a thing being used against us
here

  i	had no sooner formed the thought in my
mind that it occurred to me that now the hole
had been plugged the air seemed to be getting
uncomfortably warm and at that exact instant

i	realized that the wall was glowing and sizzling
with heat

  a heat-ray i cried someone has trained
one on us

  that blamed martian space-ship they told us
about at pharon vance said were up
against a bigger thing than we thought if those
creatures can take a space-ship a thing theyve
never seen before repair it and master its
mechanism so quickly of course with our lo-
cators damaged we couldnt have picked it up

  without a word to each other but actuated by
the same impulse we raced back to the obser-
vation room the operator there was trying
frantically to get in touch with us he had just
picked up a space-ship on the vision-plate it
answered the description of the captured martian
craft and as though to remove all doubt the
operator informed us that it was training its
beams on us

  gods vance exclaimed if theyve mas-
tered its mechanism in full were done for

  he gave me one look i read what was in his
mind and i nodded

  go ahead i said its the only thing to do

  he turned to the bank of control keys and
pressed one down there was no sound no im-
mediate answering movement of any sort but a
mment later the space-ship seemed abruptly to
burst into a blinding glow as though a cloud of
dust had suddenly begun to sparkle it spread
out from its center in all directions getting thin-
ner and thinner until it vanished altogether in
the ultimate reaches of space

  we held on to whatever substantial thing was
handy while e rocked and kicked then she
came under control again and we headed down
towards pallas and the city of gonda our
task was surprisingly easy after that perhaps
the creatures had centred their hopes on our de-
struction by the captured space-ship and its
spectacular end had taken the fight out of them
at least i know that they offered little further
resistance some of them we even managed to
capture though only a couple of them survived
the long hop to earth

  but it was weeks before we felt satisfied that
wc had cleared pallas of the last of menace and
even now we cannot say with any degree of cer-
tainty that the danger has been entirely remov-
ed however we know its nature now and we
cannot be taken by surprise again

  the surviving specimens we brought to earth
with us are being studied by our scientists and
an attempt is being made to establish a common
ground of communication with them but their
language if so one can call it has so far defied
all efforts at translation and they show an in-
ability to pick up our tongue

  but there are other methods of exchanging
ideas and they will be tried one by one until at
wonder stories quarterly

bt some measure of success is reached when
hat has been done we hope to learn something
 their past history and perhaps be able to
brow a searching light on the last days of that
janet of which some think the present asteroids

are only the disrupted fragments when if ever
this stage of communication has been reached
the result providing it is of sufficient interest
will almost certainly be recorded in due course

announcement s

a year ago with the november  issue the format of wonder stories monthly was reduced to a
smaller size

we believed at that time that the change to smaller size would be welcomed by the majority of our readers
and we continued printing the magazine at this size for a year

     it appears now however that the majority of our readers have not looked kindly on the change and daring
the year we were flooded with many thousands of letters the numbers of late have been increasing urging
that we should return to the larger size

     most of the readers argued that a magazine of such educational value as ours should not be placed on a par
with the pulp magazines of a more sensational type a large percentage of our readers seem to think that the
larger size with smooth edges was more dignified and gave a better appearance to the magazine than the smaller
size with its rough edges

     heeding these letters and the overwhelming preference of our readers we are going back to the larger size
which we formerly printed with the next issue

     the october  issue therefore is the last that will appear in the small magazine size look among the
large-size magazines for the next issue	

                        a pleasant surprise

    the november issue of wonder stories will lso give you a pleasant surprise-something that many
readers have been asking for but which was not possible until now to give you

     you will not only be surprised but we are certain that you will also be highly delighted with another im-
portant change which will also be incorporated in the november issue

     inasmuch as there will be a large demand for the next issue we advise you to place your order with your
newsdealer at once so you will not be disappointed

                                                                                              the publisher a

we offer

a sequel to the triumph of clark ashton smith acclaimed so by our readers in

                              beyond the singing flame

mr smith carries on the adventures of his explorers in that strangest of dimensions as mr smith says himself
the description of the inner dimension is a daring flight and i have almost set myself the impossible task that
dante attempted in his account of paradise you will be thrilled by this story

p schuyler miller also adds a new brilliant story to his chain of successes in

                             tetrahedra from space
we have the most vivid gripping account of a life fantastic yet scientifically possible and its conflict with our own
civilization this is no mere strange form of life story but a masterpiece of description and action in which
you feel as a chill through your blood the awful power of the tetrahedra

     the returns on the contest to find an ending for jack williamsons twelve hours to live were so un-
expectedly large that the editors have been swamped from the letters we have read our readers especially the
younger ones have shown as astounding ingenuity in working out the problem of the two chestts by a rough
count several thousand letters have been received the results with the winning letters will be published in the

will treat you to a whirl of fast-moving events on two worlds the workers have struck and scored but the
aristocrats will not tamely submit to the loss of their power the most terrible part of the conflict is yet to

to those who think
  learning music is hard-
  in the great vale of kashmeer in northern
india there descended one day from the clear
heavens a mile-long seed flashing like a huge
meteor and terrifying the superstitious asian
peoples who saw in its fall the portent of some
tremendous disaster the seed rooted itself in
this valley and before its true nature had been
ascertained the supposed meteorite began to
sprout and send forth on all sides a multitude of
mammoth tendrils which burst immediately into
leaf it covered both the southward plains and
the eternal snows and rock of the hindu kush
and himalayas with their gigantic verdure

  soon the afghan mountaineers could hear the
explosion of its leaf-buds amid their passes echo-
ing like distant thunder and at the same time
it rushed like a juggernaut upon central india
spreading in all directions and growing with the
speed of express-trains the tendrils of the mighty
vine proceeded to enmesh the asian realms
overshadowing vales peaks hills plateaus des-
erts cities and sea-boards with its titan leaves
it invaded europe and africa and then bridging
bering straits it entered north america and
ran southward ramifying on all sides till the
whole continent and also south america even to
tierra de fuego had been buried beneath the
masses of insuperable foliage

  frantic efforts to stay the progress of the plant

were made by armies with bombs and cannon
with lethal sprays and gases but all in vain
everywhere humanity was smothered beneath
the vast leaves like those of some omnipresent
upas which emitted a stupefying and narcotic
odor that conferred upon all who inhaled it a
swift euthanasia

  soon the plant had netted the whole globe
for the seas offered little or no barrier to its full-
grown stems and tendrils when the process of
growth was complete the anti-martian moiety
of the human race had joined the uncouth mon-
sters of pre-historic time in that limbo of oblivion
to which all superseded and outdated genera
have gone but through the divine clemency of
the plant-lord the final death that overtook the
die-hards was no less easy than irresistible

evade the general doom for awhile by fleeing in
a rocket-ship to the antarctic plateau here as
they were congratulating themselves on their es-
cape they saw far-off on the horizon the rearing
of the swift stems beneath whose foliage the ice
and snow appeared to melt away in rushing tor-
rents these torrents soon became a diluvial sea
in which the last dogmatists were drowned only
in this way did they elude the euthanasia of the
great leaves which had overtaken all their fel-
lows

the end

the derelict of space

continued from page 

  he found himself sitting on the deck by the small
outer dor-porte mink was dead soon the oth-
ers would be dead all of them slowly dying   
that was a good thing for mink dying so quickly
he hadnt lived to know that his brains were scat-
tered like that and his skull like an eggshell   
it was nice to die all at once    from inside he
could hear the whimpering gerald vane i dont
want to die deely please   but he was go-
ing to die

  brown thought again how much better it would
be to die all at once he found that the door-porte
lever was beside him his hand had accidentally
touched it his fingers were gripping it the air
was going out so slowly with this door-porte closed
it was awful to die just a little at a time   

  browns hand very slowly pulled at the lever
the door slid partly open the rush of wind as the
deck-air went out seemed like a graceful summer
breeze and then a gale  it blew so strong
it took your breath away  he had to grasp a
support with all his might to keep from being blown
into interstellar space

  browns head slumped down on his updrawn
knees  he was dead   

  deely gazed across the lounge toward the closed
corridor door going fast now listen to it
whine something outside must have broken

  vane was collapsed in a chair whimpering and
then he began screaming stop it dont let it
go you fool-you murderer-dont let it go i
dont want to die   

thomasson thought how foolish it was to rail
like that vane was fighting choking he was
a pitiable object-the man who had once been
strong handsome so virile-looking-so romantic
he was a pitiable object now no not pitiable-
no one should pity gerald vane he looked strick-
en of all his manhood now or perhaps he had
never had any manhood   

  under the gaze of hildas calm eyes and that
faint queer smile on her white lips gerald vane
screamed his protests-choking and gasping in the
rarefied air until suddenly he had fainted   
hilda- on the couch deely himself was
gasping now hilda-in a moment-well be
gone-

  i know- she tried to rise to her feet but the
room must have whirled before her ronald
where-are you  i-i cant seem to see you

  i just thought hilda-now at the last-you
might have something to say to me if you-have
something   

  she wavered with hands outstretched across the
few feet that separated them and on the couch
his eager arms caught her

  hilda-my wife again   

  i want to say-if only you could forgive me
ronald  

  i do i do hilda   

the roaring in thomassona head seemed to
drown their jnurmured words the triangle of
metal with its concave low ceiling was pale and
wan with starlight but it roared-as thomas-

the derelict of space

  concluded from page 

sons head was roaring and the door was strain-
ing with the outgoing whining sucking wind  

  every breath was an effort trying to breathe
and there was nothing to breathe vanes dead
body seemed so hideous over there in the chair
but on the couch deely and hilda were lying to-
gether wrapped in each others arms they were
tranquil peaceful in death

  it was all swiftly blurring before thomassons
fading senses roaring and blurring and then it
slid away into a great and everlasting silence   

  thomasson had fallen forward over his little
table and was dead   

  and thus we found them with the air gone so
that their frozen bodies were preserved through the
years and the final tableau of this drama or com-
edy or tragedy-call it what you will-was clear
before us

  we did not attempt to take the deely time-ship
back to earth but left it there with its six pass-
engers untouched as young dorrance turned ua
back and set our course toward apollo and the
earth i was at a rear turret window the little
disc-like vehicle with its small tower bravely set on
top seemed hung askew little ship of doom i
watched until it was lost among the blazing stars

           the end

the asteroid of death

         continued from page 

nounced whats the game do you suppose
hes throwing us off the track by switching to
the little flyer-or is he still on the liner

  the answer to the puzzle suddenly smote me
with startling clarity i remembered hulans
promise to kill zelna circumstances had forced
him to choose this manner of revenge

  prentice i shouted madly zelna is on
that liner-helpless  hulan has abandoned the
ship-to let it crash

  if we can overtake the ship before it reaches
the moon maybe-

  we stepped up our speed to the highest notch
the space liner had not deviated the slightest in
its direction racing on to its doom-and zelnas
death deimos loomed large in the sky

  weve got to shunt it away from the moon 
yelled prentice

  were pretty close now

  so is deimos

  a short distance ahead of us the unguided
space ship raced down upon the martian satel-
lite unpiloted the topography of the little
moon became visible

  here we are cried prentice

  with his own craft the captain ran alongside
the huge space liner and gave it a vigorous
shove following his example i did the same
it was dangerous business my little space flyer
groaned at the contact throwing me out of my
seat with combined efforts we both rammed
against the liner once more the n- was
larger than my little space flyer which bounced
off the liners hull and whirled dizzily for a mo-
ment

  look out screamed prentice

  through the front of my flyer i saw a blazing
ball rush at me my little flyer spun round and
round falling into the attraction of deimos
gravity through the window i saw jagged
mountains loom close-then whirl by me be-
tween two mighty mountain peaks my space
flyer whisked rapidly a roaring noise filled my
ears as a rain of particles smote my flyer pound-

the

ing the metal hull then i was past-out of
danger i wiped the sweat from my brow

  looking upon the detector i picked out the
n- and the space liner the unpiloted craft
was safely past having swung perilously close
to the moon i doubt however if it came as
close as i did prentice was right behind the
liner i stepped up my speed and swung along-
side the larger craft

  going aboard asked prentice

  just as soon as i get this space suit on

  the space liner was now running wild once
more heading off into space upon an uncharted
route i hooked my little flyer to the davits
where hulan had taken off shortly after i
transferred to the liner feverishly i searched
for zelna she lay in the observation chamber
her arms and legs bound securely hulan had
taken no chances on her meager knowledge of
space ship operation he had meant his revenge
to be complete

  she uttered joyous words which i did not hear
until id set the course of the space ship back
towards mars once more and removed my space
suit after that i listened i also discovered
that i too had a voice which i no longer feared
to use in her presence

  prentice swung off into pursuit of nez hulan
but the human robot had gained too much of a
start the n-s detectors so prentice told me
afterwards lost track of the little space flyer

  outlawed on three worlds we knew that when
he came back his capture was certain disguise
for him was difficult an aluminum cranium
and a dead white face marked him off from other
individuals his metal fingers would sooner or
later betray his identity

  if nez hulan ever did return to civilization
which i believe he did no one was aware of it
when humanity finally heard of nez hulan
again he was a leader among the moon pirates
who infested the earths satellite it seems that
the human robot became the scientific master-
mind of carcontes lunar buccaneers that how-
ever is another story

the city in space original

editor wonder stories quarterly

  i have read the story vandals of
the void and thought it very good
but i believe that it would not have
been nearly  excellent were it not
for the marvelous wonderful extra-
ordinary and awe-inspiring illustra-
tions of paul that man just cannot
be beat when it comes to illustrating
science fiction stories

  also the city in space was an orig-
inal idea with great possibilities i
can see a time when several of them
to be used as refuel stations and to
lessen the dangers of interplanetary
travel will be strung across the void
and established in orbits of their own
it will be like the artificial islands that
are to be placed in the atlantic for
the use of airplanes

  the only thing wrong with the story
was that it did not contain enough
sciencc another story that was very
deficient in this respect was the
scarlet planet you made a pretty
bad slip there

  lately the quarterly has had too
many short stories i think that in
this magazine you should have two
long stories and one or two shorts
like you had in the first two or three
issues

comments in esperanto

editor wonder stories quarterly
when i read the spring quarterly
i was so thrilled at the stories that
i decided on taking up esperanto-
the universal language-in order to
be able to adequately express my op-
inion on the summer issue which i
was convinced was going to be bigger
and better than ever well three
months have passed and our new
quarterly has been received and read
-and enjoyed its just well heres
where my esperanto comes in

  to whom it may concern i think
the new summer issue of our
wonder stories quarterly is mir-
inda mireginda perfekta superega
belega mirigega vibriga interesega
senspiriga and last but not least de-
likategah which translated means
wonderful marvelous perfect sup-
erb splendid astounding mirigega
means amazing too thrilling en-
grossing breath-taking and super-
fine it was some issue and-to use
an irish expression meaning im not
kidding you-im not wiping your
eye for you

  there was only one thing i didnt
think was top-notch in this issue if
it costs me my life im going to say

   i have just finished reading the
 summer quarterly and again the
 high standards of the wonder
 stories quarterly is maintained
 vandals of the void by j m
 walsh was not a complete story so
 start warming up the press for a
 sequel a war between the mercur-
 ians and the people of earth venus
 and mars would surely be contained
 in a sequel to this story it should
 prove to be one of the most interest-
 ing interplanetary war stories ever
 printed between your covers the
 only criticism i can make about this
 story is that several things in it
 didnt have scientific explanations

   the story which appealed to me for
 the honor of second place in the is-
 sue was the machine of destiny by
 u g mihalakis the theme of this
 story was unusual i liked the way
 the plot was handled and especially
 the climax wow i am pondering
 over the question whether it could
 have been possible for the hero in the
 story to escape his predestined fate

   true to the style of all clark ash-
 ton smiths stories the amazing
 planet was packed with thrills from
 beginning to end i thought that the
 heroes in the story would have had
 quite a bit of trouble getting around
 in the city of the dwarfs on account
 of diminutive doorways etc but the
 story only mentions one instance f
 them having any trouble on this
 score

   we thought that the mercurians
 had been effectively beaten in van-
 dals of the void but we will refer
 to mr walsh the question of a se-
 quel we doubt personally that the
 mercurians would venture again to
 attack the three outer planets but
 whether they do or not is mr walshs
 affair let us wait and hear what
 he says about it-editor

if you want a job with a future
get into chemistry

 chemistry ia one of the most ancient and honorable
oalling known to man during the middle agee its
adepts were the advisors of king then it was called
a blaok art and ita followers were believed to bar
supernatural powers

  ttie chemist of today with his modernized knowledge
haa ecret a tbouaandfold more potent at his command
he is the brains behind hundreds of rich industries
which could not exist without hia skill yet the field of
applied chemistry has spread so widely that it is dif-
ficult to get enough good men to fill the available posts

a chemical expert is always sure of a good income a
respected and confidential position and a guaranteed
future he may also make himself a fortune as hun-
dreds of ohomists have done before him did you ever
hear of c m halit he was an american obemist who
at the age of twenty-one diacovered how to extract
aluminum from clay it wss known that this could
be done it remained for someone to experiment and
do it there are innumerable other chemical problems
today waiting to be solved mr hall died a few years
ago leaving an estate of many millions of dollars
