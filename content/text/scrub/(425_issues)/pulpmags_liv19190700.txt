fused to be separated and knew each
other to be so competent that each was
willing to trust the other with his life on
a mere nod

  whats keepin us wad ye say 
asked mcpherson contemplatively as he
stepped onto the bridge

  some o those blasted lazy supercar-
goes or whatever they are pleased to call
their dashed selves over at the yard i
suppose snapped the captain as he
wheeled short and paced back to the other
end of the bridge

  mcpherson draped himself over the
bridge rail

  man dye ken weve got summat
aboord that makes us wonderfu attract-
ive for a certain pairson in berlin he
inquired slowly

  captain butts stopped short

  meaning the copper he inquired
brusquely

  just thot answered the engineer
im thinkin therell be a bit of veesit an
sairch before we scrape paint fra oor
plates agin th stone o th albert docks

  captain butts stepped close to his en-
gineer

  ill thank you to keep your frightened
clacking to yourself you dissolute me-
chanic he snapped its my job to take
this packet across the pond and ill not
have your old maid fears instilled into
the minds of the sheep weve got aboard
that call themselves sailors

  mcpherson waved a hairy hand that
contained a cutty pipe

  its no my fault yere an ostrich he
commented with a sour grin stick
yere head in th sand o yer foolish and
unregenerate methods but ill thank ye
to be no callin me oot o me name

  and then began a wordy wrangle that
delighted the steward who stood with his
ear cocked against one of the open chart-
house windows and smiled a pleased and
happy smile the wrangle ended as it
always ended

  get down where you belong you split-
trousered incompetent snarled butts

go down and mingle with the ashcats
below and see that when i give you the
bell im not kept waiting

  man if i had a temper like yer ain
fd pray th guid lord to curb my
worrds returned mcpherson still
im supposin yere too auld to change
much now

  which last always brought forth an
angry sputter from butts who poured
out further decorative phrases while mc-
pherson let himself down the bridge lad-
der below he confided to his assistant
that the skipper was even more irascible
than usual and he feared greatly that
hed been crossed in love or something
equally unseamanlike or deadly

  the plain facts were though mcpher-
son knew it not that captain utts was
at present greatly peeved at the cruel
manner in which the grim fates who run
the card index of human affairs had been
treating him butts nursed a secret am-
bition one might think that the destruc-
tion of three of the kaisers submarines
in fair fight would be enough for any
reasonable man but between you and
me it was by no means enough for cap-
tain ephraim butts he had a further
ambition and one that he had not yet
whispered to a soul save his own reflec-
tion in a mirror he wanted to get an-
other sub but he wanted to take it intact
or nearly so into an adjacent port and
hand it over to the authorities

  now i have no means of knowing just
how many naval men had the same am-
bition nor for that matter how many of
them were able to gratify their wish but
im inclined to think they were few
most of the young men who raced de-
troyers up and down the sea lanes were
modest chaps and they were quite satis-
fied with their lot when granted the au-
thority to paint a white star on their
ships funnel thus signifying the destruc-
tion of one tin fish

  captain butts was of agreedier mold
i am afraid in the first place it was not
his job to go hunting subs that was for
robert campbell



the navy folk his work was to take the
new asheville from port to port and
spend as little time as possible in doing it
nevertheless i suppose it is a weakness
of human kind to want to do some other
fellows job for him and it is a fact
that butts had in two or three specific-
cases where he had gotten his fish gone
out of the way to do that job on one
of the occasions he had chased the scan-
dalized sub for fifty miles or so having
had the fortune to drop one shell into her
inner works with such effect that her sub-
merging pumps were knocked out of kil-
ter and consequently she had to depend
on her speed in getting away the sight
of a heavy thirteen-knot tramp steamer
savagely chasing a somewhat erratic and
badly frightened submarine about the
western ocean so shocked a certain lieu-
tenant commander who happened on the
scene in time to see butts plug a four-
inch projectile into the sub with such ef-
fect that she blew up in the middle and
sank in two sections that he complained
to the admiral ashore at queenstown
ibout it as an infringement of privilege

  i dont mind seeing a freighter fight
if she has to sir he objected but i do
think this chap neednt have gone out
of his way to run the fish down and to
chase it its taking chances after all
sir and anyway what are we out there
for

  being a human being first the admiral
chuckled

  ive heard of captain butts before
he said if you take my advice young
man dont tell him your opinion and
above all dont get between captain
butts and the next fish he goes after
hes likely to ram you

  whereupon the lieutenant commander
came as near a snort as is permissible in
the presence of an admiral and went off
in a huff

  so captain butts walked up and down
gnawing on his ungratified desire until
the wireless operator handed him a slip
of paper on which were penciled the or-

ders for which he had been waiting as-
sembly in the lower bay was next and
then a procedure of six ships accom-
panied by two destroyers to the rendez-
vous off the banks where they were to
meet the main convoy the doughty
captain gave the necessary orders and
watched his big ship work her way slowly
out of the basin with the help of two
fussy but efficient tugs when she had
passed through the narrows butts
glanced again at his orders and called
briggs his mate

  we may have to drop the hook
down the bay he said maybe theyll
give us the clear signal to keep on out if
the others are ready anyway here are
the orders were to join the rest at the
banks take our orders for formation
from the essex and in the event of an
attack in force scatter and get to port
on our own the best way we can while
the snakes look after the subs got that

   mr briggs signifying that he had cap-
tain butts snorted and went below to the
chart room where he wedged himself in
a corner and read three pages of plu-
tarchs lives as a sedative but at the
end of the third page he sent the steward
for mcpherson and when that calm per-
son appeared wiping his hands on a piece
of waste butts motioned him to a seat

  ive been thinking about our cargo
mac he said im inclined to think
theres more in what you said than per-
haps youve any idea of

  ye surprise me now remarked the
engineer with a wry grin

   possibly replied butts with a frown
but as that happens so often youll not
mind if it doesnt excite me now listen
you know theyre horribly short of cop-
per in germany of course and that they-
ll take desperate chances to get some
im not foolish enough not to know that
they come pretty close to getting a line
on every cargo that steams out of these
ports and that we cant do anything to
stop it whats to prevent them having
a try for us


a souvenir from captain butts

  only yer ain deadly reputation skip-
per

  stow that ordered butts the or-
ders are to separate and run for it if
were attacked in force it sounds to me
just like the sort of thing the beastly
huns would want if they can cut us
out from the convoy with a scare and
then run us down theres a chance to
grab this cargo

  itll be takin more than one fish to
carry it commented the engineer

  but not more than one to take us into
port oh i know its an off chance for
them to put it over but it could be done
or- the captain stopped and his
eyes took on a light of interest

  or what now demanded the en-
gineer

  butts looked at him with a thin smile

  mac he said you know me better
than any living man and i think mrs
mcpherson would be surprised at the
way i know you look here

  the steward who was passing along
the deck and paused for an instant out-
side the open chart-house door was
startled at the vehemence with which
that door was slammed in his face and
an instant after was jolted by the bang
of the window beside it

  during the days after they had joined
the main convoy and while the dozen
ships progressed across the gray-black
wastes there were repeated and pro-
longed conferences between the captain
and the chief engineer

  youd think them two was courtin
each other remarked the second mate
to his superior mr briggs on one occa-
sion

  maybe so young man replied the
other maybe so but ive got a mighty
queer hunch that those two you mention
are fixin to cause somebody an unholy
lot of trouble

  queer old scout the skipper mused
the other

  better not let him hear you say it
observed briggs ive seen him take

three like you and break them up all
together

  the younger man laughed and flexed
his arm then he picked his hundred
and seventy pounds up on his toes and
teetered back and forth

  not that i mean to he said but id
just about crack that old man in two
parts in the first half minute

  then the lord grant that you never
run foul of him chuckled the mate
why boy ive seen that skipper of ours
take two that could give you five pounds
each crack their heads together knock
them out and then throw them down the
focsle hatch just to tidy up the deck
dont ever start with him for hes a
fighting tearing bunch of wildcats and
another thing what he cant finish the
chief can and will man alive but i well
remember seeing the skipper with noth-
ing but his two bare hands and the chief
with a ten-inch spanner tear into a long-
shore gang of fifteen and inside of ten
minutes whip the entire outfit so that it
needed two ambulances to clear the dock
dont start anything boy

  during the next few days down in the
privacy of his own particular corner of
the engine room mcpherson conducted
activities that seemed queer and unneces-
sary to his assistants and the black gang
changing watch the chief was care-
fully manufacturing a half dozen con-
trivances out of thin metal and toward
the finish of his operations handling
them very tenderly indeed it may have
been but a coincidence that the navy en-
sign in charge of the gun crew complained
to the skipper that a case of his four-inch
shells was strangely missing and that
captain butts winked at the chief en-
gineer as he promised to look into the
matter

  day and night for six days the great
ships steamed forward in orderly double
column with the cruisers and destroyers
on their flanks occasionally one of the
sea snakes would dash five or six miles
ahead and then with the white combers
robert campbell





spinning from her bows swing a wide
arc and come tearing back to cut a com-
plete circle around the convoy to report
to the essex by code they were not
using the wireless unnecessarily for fritz
is a curious being and is constantly lis-
tening to the gossip of the seas at night
che ships felt their way as best they could
in the pitchy darkness with only the bin-
nacle lights on deck and when one of the
gray shapes would loom perilously near
to another shadowy bulk explosive and
highly specific language would result for
running a convoy at night in war timq is
a matter for hunch and intuition and
then on the seventh day just as the
blackness was begining to yield to the
daily miracle of the dawn and the coast
of ireland but some six hundred miles
away four dirty gray conning towers
with the water dripping down their sides
rose out of the sea almost at the same in-
stant the shriek of the sirens and
the crack of guns were simultaneous

  here they are cried captain butts
with a yell as he called a hard-over order
to the quartermaster at the wheel jam
her over you blighter he roared and
anxiously watched the asheville heel
over to starboard as the great steel rud-
der gripped her briggs raced up on the
bridge and took his statiop with the
captain

  heres where we find out whether
they are after us cried butts in the ear
of his mate

  the convoy had spread out to offer
as poor a target as possible to the fire
of the submarines and in the growing
dawn the cruisers and destroyers were
banging away with every thing they had
the asheville headed into the north and
the skipper grinned as they began to leave
the convoy astern and then he grinned
a wider and more grim grin for one of
the submarines ceased firing at the con-
voy and swinging about shaped a course
in the wake of the freighter

  it looks as if berlin wanted that cop-
per after all muttered butts to himself

  it is an old sea axiom that a stern chase
is a long chase and a tramp steamer that
can dig fourteen knots out of her engines
can give even a supersubmersible a long
run when the latter is four miles astern
and has a surface speed of but a trifle
over fifteen knots captain butts walked
aft to where the ensign and his crew were
training their four-inch gun

  that gentle soul astern there has a
six-inch rifle mounted on his fore gun
platform if im any judge he said
and i have a very private belief that the
one thing he doesnt want is to sink this
packet but he will surely make it a lot
interesting for our upper works so if
you can drop one of your pills anywhere
on that six-incher of his it will be re-
garded as a merciful dispensation of
providence

  the ensign looked up with a scowl

  ill blow his blasted tub out of the
water and let it fall back again if i have
any luck he growled

  perhaps the subs engines were car-
bonized perhaps his oil was not up to
grade or perhaps mcpherson managed
to get another knot out of his engines but
on that point there is no definite infor-
mation ordinary arithmetic would indi-
cate that the sub should have ranged
alongside the asheville within five hours
at the least but the facts are that she
didnt it is even true that the asheville
managed to draw slightly away until the
little skipper scowled and interviewed the
chief engineer it is also true that evening
began to draw on and there was almost
no perceptible change in the situation
save that the shells from the fish had
knocked the chart-houe into a mass of
splinters cut away one half of the funnel
and ripped up enough deck plates to
build two extra large box girders the
ships gun had effected no damage that
could be noted for it was practically out-
ranged and when the night began to
fall the ashevilles way diminished

  the mate looked anxiously into the
ditch alongside then glanced at the pur-


a souvenir from captain butts

suing submarine he began to see pic-
tures of an open boat exposed to shell
fire or of a german prison and he had
a vision or two of captain butts facing
a firing squad in a german prison yard
he turned to the skipper who was hum-
ming a little tune

  hes overhauling us sir he re-
remarked

  looks that way to me was the an-
swer in fact mr briggs i rather
think hell be alongside by eleven to-
night

  briggs looked at his captain and
frowned the imminent danger of cap-
ture by a german submarine did not usu-
ally produce smiles and doubtful har-
mony in the merchant seaman of those
days and yet captain ephraim butts was
smiling and harmonizing through his
teeth

  keep her as she is mr briggs the
skipper said im going below

  down in the captains cabin there was
a consultation the consultees were cap-
tain butts mcpherson and ensign
starret

  the facts are mr starret said
captain butts that were letting that
hound astern overhaul us mac here tells
me he could outrun her if he wanted to

  then whats the idea  asked the en-
sign

  they know weve got copper and
they want it what theyll do to this
crew is another question but they wont
sink the asheville they want her intact
and theyll try to get her into a german
port somehow thats why i doubt a
great deal if theyll knock us about much
the old hooker must be capable of being
run by a prize crew

  but you dont intend to let em get
away with that surely protested the
ensign my orders are to-

  steady there counseled mcpherson

  if you are thinking about turning this
ship over to the enemy without putting
up a fight ill have you know im not in
on it snapped the young officer my

job is to knock out every german i can
and if we get done in while doing that
why its our job thats all the young
mans face grew red and his eyes
snapped i didnt expect to get mixed
up with a bunch of curs on any ship that
ever flew our flag he finished

  captain butts jumped to his feet and
his tough little frame stiffened as he
stepped forward

   ill thank you to keep a civil tongue in
your head mr starret he snapped
youre in charge of your gun but im
in charge of my ship and i dont mind
telling you that i dont take talk like
yours from any man from the admiral
both ways by the hokey young man
but ive bashed the face off many a man
for less than that

  mcpherson introduced a pacifying ac-
cent into the situation

  yell be recallin that yeve not yet
been tellin our young friend here what
yere plan is skipper ive not th least
bit o doot but that he thinks ye have in
mind surrenderin th hooker now

  he looked inquiringly at starret and
the latter growled

  it looks a lot like it to me

   then ill be tellin ye that theres nowt
o that in th wind man were contem-
platin reversin th polarity o that plan
an doin a bit o diplomatic skulduggery
o oor own

  the result of the ensuing conference
was that starret was taken into the skip-
pers confidence and the incipient storm
abated when butts had finished out-
lining his plan the young officer shoved
out his hand

  ill apologize and take back every-
thing ive said captain butts he re-
marked and you can count on me to
the last ditch ill admit i ought to have
known you better

  then we understand each other said
the skipper the bulk of the crew will
abandon ship as soon as the sub comes
up your men and some of the pick of
my own will remain hid aboard here
robert campbell



of course theyll send an officer and a
prize crew and they may try to force
some of our men back aboard to work
the packet in ive banked hard on my
belief that they wouldnt dare try to tow
us and consequently that they wouldnt
risk smashing our engine room or steer-
ing gear by a chance shot when they
come aboard itll be up to this incom-
petent mechanic here and myself to do
the rest

  by eleven-thirty the submarine had
closed in enough for a megaphoned or-
der in perfect english to reach the
ashevilles bridge

  heave to or well clear your decks
with shrapnel said the harsh voice and
gradually the ashevilles way ceased un-
til she was rolling gently in the swell
there was enough light to see a col-
lapsible boat put off from the submarine
as she lay a scant hundred yards away
as the collapsible pulled over the rattle
and creak of blocks and the hurrying
sounds of departure announced that the
ashevilles crew were abandoning ship
and the sounds reached the commander
of the sub

  the schwein are leaving the ship
heinrich he observed theyll pull
south at first and when we have done
what we are to do we will run down to
them and teach them to wait for orders

  the asheville lay rolling gently on the
swells with a low roaring coming from
her exhaust pipes and clinging to her a
deathly silence that spoke eloquently of
a helpless and abandoned ship it
seemed to the german officer rowing up
to her tall sides that she was a sentient
thing wondering what her masters had
done to her and waiting patiently for
some hand to guide her the depression
of abandonment clung to her like a pall

  the german swung himself up into the
ships forechains cast a hasty look about
the deserted decks and called up five of
his men

  return and bring the others he or-
dered and like a vague shadow the

small boat left the side of the asheville
once more the silence shut down and
then came a splashing from the side op-
posite to where the submarine lay the
german officer listened intently and
peered over the side but could see noth-
ing and he returned to the hasty survey
of the ship ten minutes later he hailed
the sub reporting that no one remained
aboard and from the darkness there
came very faintly a sound that might
have been a very large pair of porpoises
out for a late supper or a couple of mer-
maids on a little job of sirening the
difficulty with these two possibilities was
that either the mermaids had learned to
swear most accurately or that one of the
porpoises had been raised in greenock

  the collapsible boat from the sub-
marine had just spilled her complement
of five men upon the ashevilles deck
when a hairy hand reached out of a port-
hole and drove a spare grate bar into it
the boat immediately bore out its name
and collapsed completely leaving the
two ocupants with nothing but some steel
plates at which to clutch

  the german officer had his men on the
deck and was assigning them to their
duties there were eleven altogether
five of them promptly went below to
take over the engine room as they
stepped upon the floor plates they were
none too gently seized by some extremely
husky naval men and trussed up with a
speed that left them wholly unfit for
protest of any valid sort

  the remaining proceedings were a
trifle more violent on deck were six
germans and before they were quite con-
scious of what was afoot there was a
rush of men and they were scientifically
knocked on the head and laid in the scup-
pers to reflect upon the folly of counting
the contents of the hennery before the
eggs have reached maturity and in
the meantime in the oily heaving sea
alongside the submarine lying with her
hatches open to the star-dotted sky the
porpoise-mermaids or mermaid-porpois-


a souvenir from captain butts

es or what you wish clung to the rungs
of a light ladder that reached from the
deck platform down over the side four
seamen in their yellow dungarees and an
officer in overalls stood on this platform
watching idly the swaying hulk of the
asheville suddenly a flash lamp showed
aboard the freighter and simultaneously
there was a slight exclamation in the
water alongside

  was iss das queried the officer
sharply

  none o yer blighting business was
the harsh answer and therewith fol-
lowed the swing of an arm and the mo-
mentary glint of a metal object as it de-
scribed a short arc and fell upon the
platform the resulting explosion while
not violent was sufficient to blow the
group of five into the sea and cause a
torrent of language inside the hull of the
tin fish an agile figure grizzled
about the chin and with a terrier-like
head hurriedly climbed the few rungs
of the iron ladder and leaned over the
conning tower hatch

  just divide this among you you
skunks the figure yelled savagely and
forthwith dropped a most effective hand
grenade into the staring group below
this time the submarine rocked to the
explosion and captain butts yelled a
volley of language that would have
barred him from theological circles

  there was another muffled explosion
from the subs stern and she lifted per-
ceptibly to sink back again a few mo-
ments later there was a pattering of bare
feet along the vessels deck and captain
butts was joined by an almost wholly
naked mcpherson

  im thinkin shell no progress vairy
far wiout yon propeller wheel he
chortled man yere a bonny schemer
hoo many o th hoons dye ken ye
fetched wi yer surprise party

  from an oilskin case fastened about
his neck captain butts methodically took
a very business-like automatic pistol and
slung a leg over the hatch

  ill be able to tell you that in ten min-
utes mac he answered briskly in
the meantime do you keep a keen eye
down there and a grenade handy in your
hairy mitt if im not back in what you
think is good time you know what to
do

  mcpherson looked at the skipper ad-
miringly

  im no concealin fra mysel that
youve got a keen nairve skipper he
remarked its ma dooty to warm ye
hooever that yer takin yer life in yer
hands ye ken th hoon is no a square
player

  this gang will be when i get through
with them returned butts truculently
i find myself capable of a few atrocities
on my own account and may the al-
mighty help the dirty scuppercat that
starts anything below there

  the little captain dropped down to
the interior of the submarine and gazed
at the effects of his bomb then he
shuddered slightly and passed along to
the stern his fierce little goatee stuck
straight out ahead of him and his auto-
matic at the ready as he passed behind
the dynamos a blackened figure struck
savagely at him with a short iron bar
and butts shot instantly three others
came forth out of the darkness with up-
lifted hands and a cry of kamerad
and these thecaptain conducted to the
foot of the ladder

  get on deck  he snarled at them and
they wasted not an instant

  overboard wi ye ordered mcpher-
son ill no object if ye cling to yon
bit ladder but mark me one squint of
yer een and davy jones wi be havin
a few new boarders

  captain butts climbed smartly out on
the subs deck

  all clear mac he said and then
cupping his hands sent a hail over to
the steamer lay alongside here he
ordered

  twenty minutes later briggs with his
men once more aboard the ship had
robert campbell



worked the asheville close aboard the
submarine a steel hawser was broken
out of the ships lazaret and this was
made fast to the forward gun stanchions
on the submarines deck it was then paid
out slowly while the freighter forged
ahead and hitched to a bridle that was
laid out over the vessels stern

  captain butts and the chief engineer
went aboard the steamer and resumed
their clothing briggs with a crew of
four was sent aboard the submarine and
after they had pitched the dead over-
board and patched up the wounded as
well as their facilities permitted the
asheville again took up her voyage to-
ward the irish coast

  it was two days later that the lookout
on a destroyer reported to his com-
mander 

  supersub in tow of tramp steamer off
port bow sir he bawled

  in what  roared the commander

  in tow sir replied the lookout

  the commander ordered the destroy-
ers course to be changed and she raced
down to the steamer at thirty knots
crossing the freighters stern she ranged
up on her port quarter

  what ships that howled the com-
mander through-his megaphone while
the gun crews kept their rifles trained
on the steamer

  a grizzled and somewhat fierce face
leaned over the bridge rail

  steamer asheville from new york
to london was the answering roar

  where did you get that submarine 
was the next question

  went out and shot it for ourselves if
you must know came the reply

  whos master of that ship  demand-
ed the commander with a somewhat un-
easy feeling in his breast

  ephraim butts came the answer and
the commander groaned

  i might have known it he muttered
good jupiter what luck some chaps
have

  queenstown harbor was treated to an

edifying spectacle some hours later a
large and somewhat rusty tramp steamer
came into port towing a highly dejected
submarine in her wake the steel haws-
er connecting the two rose and dipped
again and bringing up the rear was a
destroyer with nearly all its crew on deck
staring curiously at the procession in
front

  an admiral viewed the spectacle
through a pair of glasses and turned to
his aide

  if im any judge theres been some-
thing happening out at sea that was never
on any naval plan i wish youd run
down to that steamer and ask the skipper
if he would mind coming up here to see
me mind dont order him invite him
otherwise if i know my man hes very
likely to tell you to make a long long
visit in a much warmer climate and then
come up here and kidnap me

  captain butts just a little truculent at
first accepted a cigar from the admiral
and answered the polite query

  theres nothing much to tell sir he
said modestly ive been wanting a tin
fish for quite a little while thought the
allied navies would like to look over the
latest model so i just brought one in
he gazed out through the open window
to where the harbor glittered in the sun
and a softer light shone in his keen little
face theres-theres another reason
perhaps sir he went on ive got a
little girl ashore and shes been pestering
me to show her how a depth gauge works
weve been studying navigation you see
so i figured it was up to me to show her
the real made-in-germany article he
reached for the brown leather satchel at
the side of his chair hoisted it up to his
lap opened it and carefully lifted out a
nickeled pressure gauge i just knocked
this off and im taking it home ho the
little girl sir for a souvenir once
more he stopped and now he blushed

  ive got her picture here sir if youd
like to look at it he said quietly hold-
ing out an open locket

the dollar

     by vincent starrett

sexton cynically tossed his hand
into the discard and rose to his
feet

  i didnt fill he said and as i hap-
pen now to be broke it is impossible for
me to lose any more money

  like a little loan billy fortune
carelessly shuffled a handful of green
bills and grinned wickedly at his friend

  not for play replied sexton you
pirates have all of my money youre
going to get this week you can lend
me a dollar if you will though i havent
even carfare

  fortune selected a crisp one dollar
bill from the sheaf in his hand and
tossed it across the table

  sextons too wild remarked kin-
ross when the unlucky player had left
the room he lacks judgment he
ought to be made to walk home once
or twice it would teach him a lesson

  hell walk all right grinned for-
tune significantly

  eh the table looked mildly in-
terested

  that was a phoney bill i handed
him chuckled the lender he may
pass it of course not knowing it to be
bad but nobody but a blind man would
take it

  he may get himself pinched re-
monstrated kinross

  serve him right

  the other newspaper men at the table
grunted approval popular as sexton
was the notion of his arrest appealed
subtly as something of a joke the
game was resumed it was just two
oclock in the morning

  sexton after leaving the press club
headed for the nearest car line he
cursed himself roundly for having lost
his weeks wages but the emotion was
transitory in a moment he profoundly
congratulated himself on having thought
to borrow the dollar the night was dis-
agreeable and walking home would
have been an unpleasant and wearying
task

  as he approached wabash avenue
head bent against the blast a form moved
in the deep shadows of a shop doorway
a sob succeeded the movement then
there was a sharp intaken breath as the
reporter stopped

  whats strouble sexton inquired
professionally

  a girl detached herself from the
shadows a white face was raised to
his neither hope nor curiosity was in
the glance

  what is it asked sexton again im-
patiently can i help

  no-thank you replied the girl

  the low voice was that of a gentle-
woman

  look here said sexton persuasively
dont be afraid im a newspaper man
and im used to talking to strangers
i hear more trouble every day than you
ever had sometimes i can help lets
hear about it

  the girl had stopped crying

  you say you are a reporter she
asked nervously

  times-star said sexton proudly

  she looked at him more closely

  i am going to give you something to
write about she suddenly announced




the dollar

i am going to-i am going down to
the lake

  great scott what for
everything-nothing said the girl
i cant tell you

  sexton hesitated

  do you need money he asked after
a moment

  no she said i havent any but i
wont need it where i am going
well said the reporter almost re-
gretfully ill have to call a policeman
i cant let you jump into the lake you
know

  she grasped his arm quickly

  please dont she begged -
if youll give me your name and ad-
dress and go home and promise not
to do anything until ive seen you to-
morrow i wont

  if you dont promise continued the
reporter ill call a policeman at once
i cant get home she said weakly
of course you have no money
heres a dollar its all ive got now
you hustle along as fast as you can
get something to eat first if you can
then go home and dont stir out of the
house till i come to-morrow what is
your name and where do you live
the girl told him suddenly she
seized his arm again she was crying

 thank you oh thank you she
sobbed i dont think-i dont think
i shall now

  good girl approved sexton a mo-
ment later he said good night

  the walk to his room was long and
cold 

  as he turned into the office next morn-
ing he encountered fortune who
grinned at sight of his victim

  how did you enjoy the walk home
last night  inquired the second reporter
sinfully joyous

  sexton was surprised

  how did you know i walked home
he demanded did you follow me
didnt have to chuckled the other
i knew youd never pass that bill

  a weakness came over sexton he
caught his breath

  wha-at

  you mean to say you didnt get wise
that it was phoney

  sexton leaned heavily against the
nearest counter he shook like a man
with a chill

  my god he said

  there was a silence while the second
reporter looked anxious

  fortune sexton said slowly after
a moment you are a damned scoundrel
-and probably a murderer 

  quickly he turned and dashed out of
the doorway he snatched a morning
paper from the newsstand at the corner
and began hastily to scan its columns
page after page he turned without find-
ng that for which he looked it was not
in the paper

  he took the elevator to the second
floor and burst dramatically upon his
city editor

  i want the morning off he said
good story i think and possibly-
sorry sexton said the gray-haired
young man at the littered desk but
i have other plans for you i want you
to hurry down to the lake at the foot
of-

  the reporter wavered then he calmly
interrupted his chief

  a girls body has just been pulled
out he said she is young and rather
pretty although poorly dressed there
is no clew to her identity in her purse
there is a counterfeit one-dollar bill
how did you know asked the city
editor it happened early this morn-
ing and the police report has just come
in how did you know
the harbor

by nancy shore

slowly the gleaming floating toss-
ing whiteness changed into shapes
the gleaming whiteness became
frozen dunes the tossing whiteness re-
vealed the winter sea and the floating
whiteness drifted over the land in sprays
of whirling mist

  dark rows of pines marched to the
waters edge curving like protecting
arms about slender gray crescents of
sand along the beaches and the cliffs
were houses with boarded-up windows
staring blindly at the sea deserted
boats half buried in the sand turned
useless broken sides to the waves
drift logs gleamed in the light of dawn
the sun searching them out against the
dark sands turning them into shapes like
dried bones of prehistoric animals

  behind the closed summer cottages
where not even the ghosts of summer
lovers remained a narrow railroad track
ties wet and gleaming slid like two dark
streaks across the frozen meadows a
train a toy amid the surrounding im-
mensities hurried along casting a new
shade yellow of smoke to mingle wvith
the other floating veils that hid the de-
serted beach

  three gray threads banners of hearth
and home rose swaying in the clear
morning air smoke from a cozy cot-
tage on the cliffs smoke from a tiny
house among the pines and smoke from
the tall crooked chimneys of the old
hansen house

  out of the mist came a peculiar slosh-
ing sound and after the sound came a
strange sight a girl appeared leading
a cow and about the cows neck was a

great wreath of roses-big tattery flow-
ers with silver stems and glossy leaves

  the wreath was formed of several
separate bouquets and where the arti-
ficial flowers did not quite meet sweet-
smelling strips of evergreen had been
woven into connecting loops

 undoubtedly some one young and
beautiful had once worn those silver-
stemmed posies  they radiated mem-
ories of bare gleaming throats of velvet
gowns of ermine sable and glittering
jewels they suggested the throbbing
notes of an orchestra tuning up the
mystery of lights turned low the ex-
pectancy of an upward-sliding curtain
they spoke of camellias and soft pink
ears gleaming rosily with the breath of
a whisperer of sweet words against them

  they were beautiful flowers and even
though the cow that wore them was very
glossy she was most indifferent she
came swinging along over the frozen
earth licking her long sad face with
her long damp tongue and swaying her
wreath with a certain air of annoyance
as if she felt that the only suitable dec-
oration for a respectable cow was a neat
copper bell-not a great heavy gewgaw
of a wreath

  the girl continually jerked the cow
forward as if she were afraid some one
might came along and witness the strange
exhibition

  however no one came but if any
one had he would have been surprised
to discover that the girl was not young
that she was not a girl at all there
were lines in her face put there by that
sharp chiseler time there were marks




the harbor

put there by pain and sorrow notice-
ably also there was a certain look of
desperation

  she was tall magnificently tall with
a white throat and a shielding depth of
breast her clear gray eyes were shaded
by dusty golden lashes and her brows
curved away like slender wings her
cheeks gleamed with the cold air and
her drooping discouraged mouth was
surprisingly crimson low on her neck
was a great twist of pale hair dead and
lifeless-the color of wet haystacks

  the woman led the cow along the path-
way pausing at a gate which sagged be-
tween moss-marked gate posts chains
gave forth a rusty jangle of welcome
and the gate swung crookedly open be-
tween gnarled wind-bent trees a path-
way of ancient clamshells led away to
a gaunt house the girl paused before
the rickety steps straightened the wreath
about the cows neck a shadow of joy
slowly lifting some of the discourage-
ment from her face and called softly
her voice breaking the silent morning air
into a thousand echoic halloos

  a red door startling against the white-
ness of the house like a seal on an old
letter opened and two figures appeared
two tiny bent creatures with shawls
over their heads like fairy-tale witches
came creeping out clinging to the porch
railings for support their sunken eyes
fixed in amazement on the girl and the
cow

  but karen the cow-and milk for
winter and milk for summer and but-
ter one of them croaked dropping her
shawl and showing her ageworn work-
bent figure karen-the money in the
box her voice was raised suspicious-
ly and her faded eyes gleamed with anger

  oh no no auntie i did not touch
the funeral money you can have the
tall plum cakes as you always planned
and all the trimmings on your coffin too
i earned the extra money for the cow
last month when i was up at oysterville
taking care of captain swensons wife

-dont you remember-i told you about
the wife of the man who had the clam
factory up there she had a baby too
and the doctor got caught by the tide at
hug-the coast point and did not get
there and i did everything for her her
husband was frightened it was their first
baby and he paid me well-and we have
the cow 

  karen talked as if it were hard to
make the old women understand her
sentences were stilted and her voice
pitched high it always wearied her
to try to explain things to them she
paused and then added like an indulgent
mother

  mrs davis did the cow up in the
wreath she said that when people are
as old as you are it is time to have fes-
tivities upon their birthdays she named
the cow rosebud  karen laughed and
jerked the wreath into place again
once mrs davis wore those flowers
at a grand party-once when she was
young and rich the girl added softly
it seemed very wonderful to her that
one could part with anything that had
meant joy and happiness

  karen karen but you are good
the girls mother croaked karen my
one good child she pronounced the
name gently making the letters form a
single syllable but putting any amount
of affection into the word

  the two old women crept along the
broken steps coming nearer to pat the
nose of the cow to caress the velvet
flowers to pinch off evergreen needles
and chew them between mumbling lips
glancing up every few seconds to smile
at the girl to blink kindly and content-
edly at her through the strong morning
light which showed thousands of tiny
crisscrosses on their leathery skins-and
revealed the animal-like sadness of their
shifting rheumy eyes

  go back into the house now little
women and cuddle down by the fire
karen will take rosebud over and milk
her and very soon you shall have milk
nancy shore



  the old auntie sidled away across the
porch to return carrying a rusty bucket
which she was polishing on her red
flannel petticoat her exposed thin old
legs looked somehow childish in their
white hand-knit socks above heavy
muddy shoes

  no no auntie cant start in with a
rusty bucket  have to be clean have to
try to run a dairy now see  karen said
as if she were trying to teach a lesson
to a child auntie hung her head and
muttered about the old days her shaking
chin a forerunner of tears here dear
you may carry in the wreath and mother
may bring out the shining new pail
karen went on desperately trying to
keep peace by a great show of fairness
in a second the little mother brought
out a new and shining pail

  karen on my birthday i have news
for you-on my birthday she an-
nounced in a harsh excited whisper
slipping along over the frozen grass to-
wards karen the girl paused a bar
of sunshine polishing the pail on her
arm and bent nearer the better to hear
her mother but he has come back-
he on the hill when you had gone for
the cow-which then we did not know
we had-he came he came by calling for
you just the same just the same

  the pail fell to the ground with a
crash the cow forgotten wandered
off over the frost-stiffened flowers
of a deserted garden karen stooped
nearer and nearer to her mother

  mother no-it cannot be kent could
not come again not now oh he was
too slow unbelief filled her voice
i am old oh i am old she adided so
softly that even her mother did not hear
her nor know why her eyes wandered
away over the dismal garden only to
return and settle on her mud-covered
work-broken boots oh and i am
ugly she said slowly raising her eyes
to her red hands as if it took physical
things to make her understand how truly
time can change beauty

-l s

  i can not help it-he came only
the disjointed arrangement of her sen-
tence marked karens mother as a for-
eigner she started for the house but
once more came teetering back

  i said to auntie that it was but more
trouble but more trouble i said to her
that it was to be expected that even
more may be put upon us i told her
you will not have to speak with her
about it too the old lady sighed
sharply taking her breath into her lungs
with a rattle as if even the effort to
breathe hurt her sentences were per-
meated with fatalism she seemed to be
announcing a proved fact

  listen little foolish mother long
jong ago we decided all about the man
on the hill karen spoke as if she had
become a child to please a child we
settled it all dont worry over him and
the people here in this square house
look we have the cow and the square
house the beautiful square house and
auntie and the meeting with the spirits
of your youth why you are in great
luck little mother you know just what
you believe-so after all you have your
hearts desire

  karen enumerated her mothers treas-
ures as one does a childs stock of toys
she stooped above her gave the sunken
gray eyes a sweet courageous lok
pulled the shawl closer about the bent
shoulders trying against her own will
t put her mothers mind at rest

  her mothers only answer was a far-
away look and with another rattling
sigh she turned from karen muttering
over and over hearts desire hearts
desire

  karen led the cow across a frost-
hardened meadow to a sagging roofed
barn which leaned crazily away from
the buffeting winds of the coast she
pulled at the door tramping down the
encroaching meadow grass to allow it to
swing open and jerked the cow into the
deserted shadowy place seated on a
three-legged stool she began to milk


the harbor

  hay over head earth beneath feet
a peaceful cow a tiny stool and a deep-
chested woman made a picture of the
far northland not connected with the
wind-swept beach and its rows of sum-
mer cottages and its toy railroad karen
glancing about the old stable sensed the
picture she made and allowed her
thoughts to be led away down strange
pathways of the distant past bringing
weird visions before her making for-
gotten scenes creep forth to haunt the
remote corners of that dusty straw-
stuffed barn

  years before there had been a wed-
ding feast in norway there had been
fiddlers and many guests-girls in great
caps and men in gayly embroidered
vests old women cooked incessantly
while a priest waited in a mountain
chapel to perform the ceremony the
groom a tall boy with a great shock
of unruly hair stared avidly at a little
thing in a stiff jeweled lace cap who
for all her shy glances was so soon to
be his wife there had been singing all
day long

  just before the wedding hour another
group of guests arrived-cousins from
a far-off mountain hamlet the last
guest to dismount from the coach was a
girl who peered up at the groom-to-be
a trifle amazed at the great size of the
man her cousin had decided to marry
from her black bodice the sleeves of
white misty muslin stood out like airy
fairy wings her flat gold braids were
wound round and round her capless
head her shoulders were crossed with
silver chains from which fluttered tiny
red and blue tassels she did not hurry
about with her cousin admiring the linen
chests or tasting the foods for the feast
she never stirred to mingle with the
dancers she merely sat her little
hands unmarred by work folded in her
smooth silken lap her slippered feet
swinging and staredat the boy with the
unruly hair the boy feeling a good bit
ignored in the mad preparations for his

own wedding believing that the linens
and the food were entirely too attractive
to his bride glanced once too often at
the little mountain girl whose eyes had
never left his face all of her dream-
filled mind seemed to shine out of her
gray eyes as she answered his smiles
she was a dreamer a spirit maiden of
the north and she did not know tliat
the tall boy was merely a healthy young
animal with a sudden desire to crush
her pale flat braids beneath his lips
abruptly just as the wedding peals were
sounding the boy picked up the little
stranger and much to the alarm and
horror of the wedding guests ran down
the mountain with her in his arms and
disappeared

  after days of hard work after months
of want and suffering after times of
hunger times of remorse the couple
she with her fluffy sleeves droopy and
dirty he with his wedding vest torn by
toil and his face blanched by hardship
went on board a great ship bound for
america

  karen had been born in the steerag
of that ship which after a storm-bound
miserable voyage had spewed a strange
cargo of humanity upon an unwelcoming
bleak pier

  a norse fishing village on long fin-
ger point had sheltered the tall man
with ttte mussed unruly hair the wee
frightened girl with the tousled pale
braids and the squalling karen on a
meadow behind the point the man built
a hut a mere mud hut with a flat stone
before the door and the hut had been
the home of the man the girl the baby
and the cow

  when karen was eleven months old
a little sister arrived and when that atom
was two days old her mother with
karen tugging at her skirts had gone
forth to milk to plow and to hoe the
potatoes she had discovered among
other startling facts which marriage had
forced upon her that the boy who had
carried her down the mountains who
nancy shore



had whispered the meaning of love into
her eager ears was in no way related
to the silent selfish man who smoked all
the hours of the day before his mud hut
and growled ceaselessly about the work
he never did

  time passed

  prosperity followed a railroad from
the city to long finger point summer
time became three long busy months
crowded with serving people who built
summer cottages on the meadow or
hung little places like gay bird cages
half way up the cliffs along the beach

  the hansens now a cross man a
work-bent woman and five dirty chil-
dren overflowed the flat stone before
the cabin and stared at the gay summer
people who passed and repassed the
place-a procession of drooping hats
and gay sweaters

  what are you thinking little
mother karen would often ask won-
dering at her mothers dream-filled eyes

  the square house the beautiful
square house white perhaps i want it
of all the dreams in which the mother
of karen wrapped her brain this was
the only one that ever came true

  karen eagerly watching how other
people lived learned that many of the
cottagers and campers desired a hotel
on the beach a cheap hotel where no
one dressed for dinner where children
were not taboo where a vacation could
be enjoyed for very little money

  standing one evening before the flat
stone she expounded her plan to the
family of hansen because she was the
child of her parents strength and first
passion she had inherited a certain
amount of beauty and brains a combina-
tion not possessed by any of the others
her father entirely overlooked her pos-
session of brains but he remembered his
own great body and felt a certain pride
in her strength aye she was strong
and without a doubt it would be well to
heed her

  so the outcome of karens speech was

that by the next spring a gaunt square
house had been raised upon the spot
where for years the hansen hovel had
bowed its grimy head needy relatives
imported for the building of the house
stayed on to help run the hotel

  the square house the beautiful reality
of the dreaming little mothers desire
was in truth nothing but a grave for her
hopes cheaply built it reared itself
among some wind-bent trees behind a
wish-bone shaped gateway of dried
whalebones the dreamihouse was
white bluish white with yellow trim-
mings at one side a beehive-shaped
summer house supplied a spot for sleepy
granddads by day and spooning lovers
by night beside the gateway were some
bath houses untidy spots with wet sand
oozing up under broken floors and dirty
towels hanging like flags over the doors
behind the house was a great garden
where early and late the little hansens
toiled-stooping over their beds weeding
weeding weeding after a few successful
seasons a troop of cows stood patiently
before the whalebone gateway tinkling
their bells and calling to karen to come
and milk them with the cows came a
smoke-house and a peculiar old country
ice-house in strange contrast to the
ever-growing string of unlovely out-
houses was the flower garden beds neat-
ly bordered with clam shells a waving
fluttering daub of fragrance and color

  the hansen hotel was crowded year
after year with little clerks cheap store-
keepers mostly foreigners who turned
troops of children into the yard behind
the whalebones tired grandmothers
were sent to the beach to enjoy a two
weeks vacation and guard a herd of
saucy grandchildren one room at the
hansen hotel could accommodate a
whole family and the rates were ad-
justable to suit any pocketbook

  in winter the hansen family lived in
the kitchen the rest of the house being
shut away dark damp echoic in this
time of rest mrs hansen generally de-


the harbor

voted a few days to the uninteresting
unadventuresome task of having a new
baby sometimes strange old-country
celebrations were held much to eat
much to drink many people crowding
into the kitchen steam dripping off
dirty clothes onto dirtier babies after
the eating and drinking came a long su-
perstitious religious ceremony-for they
were all old-country spiritualists

  with summer all thoughts of celebra-
tion were lost in one long orgy of work

  karen was up at dawn setting tables
planning meals boiling crabs making
tasteless butter-grinding out her youth
for money which poor management
wasted

  her brothers were jerked out of bed
at dawn to wade in cold water for crabs
to dig in wet sand for clams to tramp
through dewy forests for berries little
cold kiddies trooping into the kitchen to
lay the spoils of their efforts before their
father and then to rush away in the same
wet clothes to work all day in the garden

  karen and her mother spent hours
over the great range-while the husband
and father marched proudly about watch-
ing his guests play croquet

  the whole hansen family slept in one
room behind the kitchen of course if
there were too many children they could
sleep just any place dining-room tables
back stairs or in a wet haystack

  then one day baby selma died-one
busy day in june when the summer rush
was just beginning-and because no one
had time to mourn for her a new light of
desperation crept into the gray eyes of
the mother

  time passed

  karen finished the coast school and
her sister was married to a huge saloon
keeper from olwaco a little later
karen a tall girl of seventeen slender
and sweet to look upon went to take
care of her sister when she had twin
babies when karen came back to the
square house her eyes had a new look-
wonder she was changed indefinably

changed if words had been her portion
at that time she might have said a trifle
sadly that her soul had been born simul-
taneously with the birth of christines
twins

  one day in early fall karens mother
was in the wood-girt meadow cutting
with an old fashioned scythe and long
swishing sweeps vferns for winter bed-
ding for the cattle as she swung along
her body following the scythe her eyes
on her work she became aware of a
sound other than the rhythmical swish
szvish swish of the long knife against
the brown sweet-smelling ferns stand
ing in a hidden opening in the woods was
karen her chin was raised to an angle
of listening her wide gray eyes peered
ahead with a strained expression her
voice which reached her mothers ears
seemed not only to be questioning the
bird and the trees and the open sky but
to be imploring help in time of great
need

  i know that they are different-but
how are they different oh how are
they different if i knew then i could
change us they dont have dirt and
pigs and babies in a heap that i know

  the girl paused and her mother
pushed one end of the scythe into the
ground and crept nearer her strange
daughter the girl had raised herself 
her toes as if trying to peer over an ob-
stacle

  they are like a hill father and all of
them and the way they live and i am
just under the hill-but i dont know the
pathway over it work work work
dirt babies ugly things i think i shall
die but how am i to find out if there
is anything different in the world 

  higher and higher the girl pulled her-
self up as if by sheer physical strength
her splendid body might be forced to cast
some gleams of light into her searching
brain

  her mother standing beside the great
scythe suddenly realized that she was
watching the punishment which had be-
nancy shore



gun at karens birth-the punishment
for that one act which had ruined the
mothers whole life in that race down the
mountain with her cousins lover the
whimsical mind of the woman of the
north although blunted by disappoint-
ment and dulled by work felt blindly
that this girl would go on paying for
years to come-paying for all tlat the
girl in the fluffy sleeves-and silver
chains had done suddenly the bent
woman beside the scythe felt a tumult-
uous desire to hurl herself upon that
great curved knife-to hack and gash
and tear at her own body in a futile at-
tempt to punish that body for leading
her astray instead she crept out and
ended karens revery by hurrying her
back to the gritty sink in the square
house-the gritty sink heaped high with
greasy white chinaware

  that same fall karen received the im-
petus that sent her flying up the hill which
had hidden her from the lives of other
people

  one night she was walking along the
beach gathering dead fish which were to
be used as fertilizer instinctively she
was ashamed of her occupation and hid
herself away from an approaching group
of summer people she crouched in the
shadowy sand behind a shielding boat
while the group of laughing people
paused nearby and unconsciously told
her just what real people thought of such
an establishment as the hansen hotel
she heard them giggling about the food
prepared in the dirty kitchen she won-
dered why it was a joke to have one bath-
tub for forty people she questioned ig-
norantly why other people spoke of her-
self and her brothers and sisters as little
slaves quite filled with wonderment
she realized that these people from the
beautiful summer houses on the cliffs were
more than laughing at her family but with
scalding cheeks she heard her own name
trientioned in connection with the advent
of her sisters bahies-and shemade the
alarming discovery that her father had

done a criminal thing when he had taken
money for christine from the fat saloon-
keeper

  with a gnawing fear at her heart and
her breath cold and rasping in her throat
she learned that the name of hilma-the
little slim blond hilma-was a disgrace-
ful by-word among the summer colon-
ists from that moment karen began to
connect perfume ribbons cheap jewelry
and the hearing of little slipping foot-
steps creeping into a house in the dawn-
time the feeling of a slender cold body
sliding into bed beside an older sister-
with a tragedy peculiar to innocent girl-
hood when her tortured mind was
once more able to hear the voices of the
knowledge bringers she realized why her
brothers coughed so much

  for hours karen lay there behind her
shielding boat turning twisting moan-
ing biting her hands--like a tormented
wild creature then with the calmness
of the peaceful blue night some of the
forgotten visions of her mothers youth
crept down over the beach to bid her be
up and on her way far into the night
karen planned the salvation of the han-
sen family

  karen did not spend the next winter in
the square house she had gone home
with a family from the cliffs-to work
for her high school education the next
summer she honestly tried to improve
matters at the hotel and just as honestly
she failed the next winter karen spent
in a doctors home in port greenflower
and the next year saw her wearing a pro-
bationers uniform at the hospital in that
town

  she was summoned home from the
hospital by an urgent message concern-
ing hilma and upon her arrival she
called the family together in a conplave
which she planned as a beginning of great
changes that would affect the whole
establishment

  to karen sitting in the deserted barn
milking the birthday cow the vision of
that family conference came back with


the harbor

alarming clearness her tragic disap-
pointment made it a never-to-be-forgot-
ten event crowded together were all
the members of the family frightened
like dull animals at the solemnity of the
occasion frain emma and hulda
gathered in a group near their eldest
brother egbert who looked as if he were
listening to words spoken in a strange
fascinating language mother hansen
sat a bit apart as if she had no right to
take an active part in the quarrel be-
side her was an empty little rocker where
hilma had spent many hours humming
as she rocked like a little girl even
karen did not suspect that her mother
was ceaselessly caressing in the darkness
of her pocket one of the girls beloved
ribbons

  auntie stood a little in front of a
group of agreeing relatives and before
them all karen and her father paced up
and down like speakers in a debate-
talking talking talking

  no one shall lizzen to her shut
up her father roared and then flew
into a torrent of angry speech the
family did not have to clean up or change
its way of living did not people pay
them well for boarding them  the
coughing boys were merely lazy-they
could work if they cared to the girls
were not bad never they were smart
smartness removed all sting of evil
hilma was the fool she had gotten into
silly trouble karen was another fool-
coming home spending money because
her mother the great stupid had sent
her word about hilma what if the man
to whom they had just married hilma
did come from a hut beside the cranberry
marsh-he of the humped back had
not the city boys father paid the crooked
man to marry hilma it had cost them
nothing why fuss the thing might
happen to anyone lucky there had
been a crooked man handy what if
egbert were thin what if his chest did
pain him all could not have plenty in
this world why howl always of the

dirt the good lord made it did he
not

  the mother staring backward at her
brood had slipped away to call back the
spirit of baby selma to plant childish
flowers in a warm sheltered corner of
her garden-candy-tuft pink poppies
and forget-me-nots

  karen never forgot the first result of
the family meeting someone had wak-
ened her in the middle of the night
someone with gray visionary eyes had
sat upon her bed and asked her ques-
tion after question a cold thin hand
had pressed hers gratefully and lips that
seemed old despite the softness of youth
had kissed her and the next morning
her father had ranted about egbert the
wise fool who had run away in the night
he with his fine talk of education with
nothing but a cough and a pair of worn
shoes to his name

  suddenly sitting in that dusty barn
karen stretched her arms eagerly out
toward another shadowy vision with a
little cry she dropped them shuddering
to think that memory could be so potent
for after all those years she thought
she was holding emma in her arms again
emma who had died coughing in the
midst of the boarding season while the
old father stuffed and padded the walls
with horse blankets to keep the tumult of
her sickness from the rest of the hotel
karens heart had ached far worse than
the lungs of the poor girl who had been
cheated out of all the world-even out
of life itself

  after that life at the hansen hotel
was just an orgy of doctors and nurses
and beefsteaks and cream and eggs-
with death who refused to loosen his
grip leering in at the windows of the
square house of dreams

  for three years karen with a de-
termined expression on her face
scrubbed but alas she scrubbed too late

  one spring egbert returned in
march with the wind howling in the
trees with rain beating in the windows
nancy shore



he lectured to a jeering populace on the
undiscovered subject of eugenics later
the whole village taunted the cityfied
swede when he opened the school house
and tried to teach came the night when
egbert the visionary egbert the dream-
er died-he who had only loved one
thing more than wisdom-and that one
thing a cruel scornful woman

   karen karen dont give up make
it give you something life i mean be-
cause we have given it so many lives
oh win something you poor poor child
he had moaned clinging to his sis-
ters hand and tossing to and fro on the
shoddy mattress of what had once been
the bridal-suite bed of the hansen hotel
karen they pushed us here they pushed
us into hell my mother what did she
give me weakness and a dreamers
brain filled with taunting visions god
in heaven what have i not wanted to
-do he turned away his thin hand
clutching his throat his saintlike face
filled with memories of the beauties of
the world which he had been allowed
but to glimpse not possess and he
my father what did he give me he
made me an animal a grovelling animal
now i am dying and that is their fault
too in all my life never have i been
warm and never have i had enough to
eat now i implore you-make life
give you something-to-to love i

   after egbert died no one came to the
 hotel-the fear of death had won out
 over even cheapness

   the beautiful square house of dreams
 was deserted except for karen her
 father her mother aud one old aunt

   karen scattered her memories to the
winds of the past and peering up into
the shadowy depths of hay above her
head asked again the question that for
years she had been repeating wrhat was
life giving her what was she giving
life the answer came in terms of
work work and study kindness to people
who all along the beach sought her out
in times of sickness work and study

 -not such a bad way to spend life she
 reasoned if only the first lessons had
 not been so bitter if only the work were
 not so unending

  now he had come back

  karen shook her head as if by the
mere movement she could do away with
truant thoughts she wanted no taunt-
ing visions of the one happy time in
her life her gesture was futile-mem-
ories sweetly insistent crowded into her
brain

  she saw the deserted summer houses
with boarded-up windows blinking blind-
ly at the winter sea then she saw one
house where a light had gleamed like a
friendly beacon through many a winter
night she-knew every nook and cranny
of that house on the cliffs and though
for years she had not set foot within
it she felt the sensation of home steal
over her as she thought of it it was
there she had gone to nurse the broken
illtreated body of kent dutton back to
some semblance of life

 hello norse queen he had
mocked when he had recovered from
weeks of delirious stupor following an
injury received in a disgraceful motor
wreck hello norse queen he said
recognizing his nurse how is the tribe
of hansen still gathering dead fish
for garden sass

  karen longed to despise the man for
his very weakness he had possessed
everything that she had so desired and
he had wilfully cast his life up in broken
bits this man who had all the genius
denied to egbert merely lay counting
the hours until he should be strong
enough for new dissipation

  that same fate which had handed
karen only worthless remnants of life
out of which to make a thing called
existence grinned and played a strange
joke on kent dutton fate shuffled the
cards called propinquity strength de-
spondency and love together with one
marked karen-and spread them before
his listless hands


the harbor

  karen was to learn strange things from
that hand which fate dealt for kent
dutton she learned that the full moon
might mean something besides a promise
of crabs in the morning she realized
that the glowing coals in the fireplace
might bring thoughts of something more
than an empty woodbox taking food
in a companionable manner meant more
than mere memories of a greasy dish-
pan to walk in the pine woods with
kent was a trifle different from a rush
to find a spot where blackberries grew
her old enemy the sea which for years
had only meant cold and damp and howl-
ing winds come to sing a soft and croon-
ing lullaby

  then the shadow born in that far
away flight down one of norways moun-
tains began to cast bleak darkness over
karens time of love she realized that
this wonderful passion of hers was but
temporary pleasure there were things
in her life things that had scarred her
brow which she could never desert
there were things in kents life things
with which he had scarred his brow that
she feared he could never conquer
beaten firmly upon her mind was the
knowledge of her peculiar heritage her
strange governing antecedents the
fears that had marked her life made
karen afraid to undertake anything for
herself kents delirious ravings were
shadowed in her mind by egberts dying
commands kent was the one thing she
wanted life to give her and she was
afraid to take him even love had
come to her life with a broken body and
a scarred face

  i cant marry anyone kent i have
to care for mother and father karen
could still hear her voice she could still
hear kent pleading with her

  how he had begged her to desert them
to come away with him to allow him
to show her life with his very words
had come a bitter realization that in
his heart he held no responsibility sa-
cred she realized that all her explana-

tions were in vain kents own selfish
inadequacy had raised another barrier
between them

  we shall go away leave the terrible
beach i shall go on writing stories
karen we shall love and live

  i cant marry any one who is selfish
kent darling karen had wept father
was selfish-and look at all of us it
would only mean that i should be cheated
more and more i cant be responsible
for anything else dear love means
kindness and care to me egbert told
me to hang on until i was sure of some-
thing oh kent dear dear kent i am
not sure of you not sure at all

  why you are strong enough for two
of us think of your wonderful mind
and your great splendid body think what
you have done for me why i cant
help being strong and growing stronger
if i am with you

  think of the strength in my fathers
body and what it did for us karen
had whispered then she proceeded to
strip all the glory of love from her life
by painting to her lover the sordidness
of that life she left out nothing-the
stolen bride the baby in the steerage
the dirt the disease the hordes of chil-
dren the whole tragedy of her exist-
ance fell from her ashamed lips

  my father was like a giant who lay
sleeping all day and feasted all night
upon the tribute his slaves brought him
-but these slaves were his own flesh and
blood i cant marry any one like you
kent dont you see if i marry it
must be someone who will help me wash
the dirt marks off my soul not some-
one who will smear on more it must
be someone who will raise me me and
my babies not someone whom i shall
have to shove along to make him decent
my shoulders are broad but they cant
carry any more i am not quite of god-
dess size you know  she laughed drear-
ily at her poor battered bit of humor
i shall go on carrying those old people
on my shoulders while you go away and
nancy shore



try to make life count big for you if
it does-come back but the fight is
too big for any hope of those dreams
coming true my dear my very dear
in spite of her fatalistic disbelief he had
left her swearing that some day he
would return-filled with the strength
she craved

  to karen sitting in the straw-stuffed
barn was granted one more tragic pic-
ture-her fathers death like a wicked
old king he called together his few
faithful retainers and repeated on his
death-bed tales of splendor and pomp
karen knew that her mother was won-
dering if that cruel drooping mouth had
ever beguiled her with sweet sweet
words or if that gaunt leathery cheek
had ever burned against her own through
nights of youthful love strangely as
she looked at the old man karen wept
and realized that she was thinking of
kent could that broken withered crea-
ture ever have been her great strong
father 

  at last it was over in state the own-
er of the one-time prosperous hotel
hansen rode away in the ornate auto-
mobile hearse from the village-and left
three women alone in the poverty-strick-
en house of tragedy auntie clicked her
teeth ceaselessly against her tongue in
an age-old sound of woe suddenly
karens mother broke the silence croak-
ing forth a sentence which unconscious-
ly told her daughter that she too knew
that life had cheated her

  always did i want to ride in an auto-
mobile-and he did it first he did it
first

  karen picked up her pail and started
for the house again she shook her head
roughly as if she were trying to break in
upon her thoughts she wanted no more
memory visions she had torn her heart
with enough

  the two old creatures by the fire gave
no sign of greeting as the girl came into
the kitchen finally the mother spoke

  on my birthday more trouble all

memory of the gift of the cow was stifled
in her present grief

  but mother why do you fret so
i have not even seen him nor has he seen
me he will not want me i am old

  tiny openings along the front of the
range gleamed like little windows in a
dark house flames curled up behind
them casting a ruby light about the old
kitchen tinting the girls cheeks with
rose wiping all the weary lines of dis-
couragement away from her fine brow
the lights of a real home would never
have the power to make karen radiant
she stood mutely watching the old wom-
en realizing that for their childish peace
of mind she must put her greatest sac-
rifice into the surety of words their
silence demanded it

  he comes to take you-he comes
who will care for us the money long
since is all gone he takes the bread
from our mouths the blood from our
hearts

  with her hands over her ears karen
fled to her own room she was dealing
with children-children who were filled
with selfish temper

  through the intense silence of the old
house the nagging personalities of the
two old women followed her and
seemed to invade the room where she
sat her head buried in her arms she
knew those two old creatures so well
that she could almost hear their thoughts
her shoulders sank hopelessly her
mouth trembled and her breath came in
one long desperate sob she had made
her decision

  from the foot of the long dark stairs
a voice complained of hunger reminding
karen that the world still went on-the
world and work and service

  while her two charges ate the simple
meal she set before them she was con-
scious that their looks invited her to un-
burden her thoughts to them finally
in desperation she paused on her way
to the store-room to say

  mother dear and little auntie you


the harbor

are not to worry even if he has come
to take me i shall not go i shall stay
here with you-always as long as you
need me i stay that i promise
karens eyes showed great surprise
and pity when her mother teetered to
her and standing on tiptoe pressed her
flabby cheek against the girls glowing
face

  one good child left to me-one good
child the words were a croon of sheer
contentment

  karen her mind filled with a strange
mingling of joy and peace stooped and
patted her mothers head then she
turned away seeking air freedom
peace which she knew she could find
if she went forth alone

  from a tiny house among the pines
she heard a wavering voice singing soft-
ly oh happy harbor of gods saints
oh sweet and pleasant shore mrs
davis who spent all her time in what
had once been merely a summer home
who had lost position wealth family
and friends could still sit at her tiny
organ and praise god for the place
wherein she spent her days

  it is a harbor isnt it-this beach of
ours where if we only look for it we
can find every form of contentment
mrs davis said coming to her door and
smiling at karens look of unbelief and
sarcasm did the little old people like
the wreathed bossy did you tell them
that the flowers themselves had a his-
tory 

  abruptly without the slightest warn-
ing karen who had never sought solace
on her own mothers bosom found her-
self weeping her heart out in another
womans arms the whole pitiful tale
tumbled forth and as mrs davis kissed
the poor starved lips she murmured
over and over again

  aye a harbor of gods saints-of
gods saints

  strangely comforted karen went once
more on her way along the cliffs from
the moment when she had given her

promise to her mother she knew that
she must seek out kent and tell him
she had thought to put the task aside
but fate hurried her on until she came in
sight of the familiar cottage and once
more called the call which she and kent
in the past had used so often

  kent answered and stood staring at
her as amazed to see her as she was at
his appearance he was a new kent a
man re-born the eternal light of life
shining from his steady eyes the strength
of manhood vitalizing his straight body
he raised his arm in a sign of joyful
greeting karen the girl for whom he
had gone on such a strange stern jour-
ney stood before him her hair flecked
with mist falling about her face like a
silver halo

  karen ivaren look at me im back
im good you can trust me now i
dont need your strength i have my own
all that i need now is your love he
called as if he were merely finishing a
sentence started years before i tried
to go to the very depths but every place
i went you went along-to pull me back
i could never forget you im through
with the mess of life im sane and be-
loved i am worthy of you-worthy
he turned into the house to return with
a sheaf of writings which he displayed
as a child might show to a teacher a
completed lesson people like them i
cant write enough but they were all just
for you he stared at karen a moment
and a frown slid into a groove between
his eyes you are too thin and you
are too sad but i shall change all that
my beloved he laughed a bit as if he
were remembering things he thought she
had forgotten things concerning the man
he once had been however in his mind
was but one vital question they were
too old he knew to hide their emotions
they did not have to sham as their time
for make-believe was long since passed
the beach in winter was a thing with-
out finery and trimming a thing funda-
mental and their love was of the winter
world for all other crimes-



beach we shall marry and live here
safely on the cliffs we shall bring up
our children to be good to see good and
to do good

  kent i cant come i came to tell
you that after all life cheated me
life cheated you you came too late
the waiting was all for nothing my
children are but two old women who sit
beside the fire thinking of the spirits of
their lost youth-in the square house of
dreams

  ill take care of the old women ill
take care of every one kent almost
screamed at her retreating figure

  i cant come i promised karen
sobbed back as she stumbled along the
cliff pathway i promised and it nearly
broke my heart- oh kent dont break
what little heart is left-dont break it
all

  karen ran blindly along sentences and
words beating at her brain harsh
thoughts forming into expression on her
lips suggestions of things she had been
thinking ever since she was a tiny girl
burst from her mouth the world was
a dwelling place of selfish monsters
monsters that sapped and fed upon her
life and hearts blood as long as she
could feed those who demanded food
nothing else mattered after all what
was a lonely life what counted a
bruised heart

  beneath her feet curved the harbor a
place of shelter for voyage-worn ships
pines crept to the water edge and the
blue sky arched high its unheeding head

like a great smooth bell above tossing
green waves sea gulls pink legs tucked
under shining wings wheeled and
shrieked in everlasting freedom
from an old house of dreams smoke
drifted across the world-a gray flag of
memories and from a little house in the
pines some one sang on and on about a
harbor-for gods saints

  karen laughed aloud at the song
what a taunt-when two old women
could mar and torture life year after
year

  suddenly her tear-blinded eyes became
aware of a familiar little be-shawled
figure standing mutely beside her listen-
ing to the music the girl turned ab-
ruptly away

  the little figure crept nearer and a bit
timidly placed her hand on karens arm

  im a saint aint i suffered enough
-to make a saint will giving happi-
ness give peace  aye it does karen i
know-at last punishment is over
you are a saint i am a saint me and
auntie-together we shall make out
my good child has done no wrong she
is a saint in the happy harbor run oh
run-let some one make it a happy har-
bor-here where we all died from sor-
row oh make it a happy harbor at
last

  gently at first and then sternly using
all her failing strength the old woman
pushed karen back toward the man who
had earned her and who waited for her
in the house on the cliffs above the
harbor

     iii-can do-

foo chow was one of the hum-
blest participants in armageddon

as in civil life there must be the
hewers of wood and the drawers of
water so in war there must be those
whose weapon is the pick and shovel
whose part of the glory lies too far be-
hind the lines to receive mention

  foo chow was one of these writh
thousands of his coolie brethren he had
crossed two seas from the flowery king-
dom to play his part in the foreign
devils great war he was of the bat-
talion of labor it was for him to giye
his sweat while others gave their blood
viewed from the standpoint of the heroic
he was not a figure for the casual eye
to focus upon his teetering gait the
result of generations of burden-bearers
his round placid inscrutable face the re-
sult of centuries of a stagnant civiliza-
tion seemed to have no outstanding place
in thegreat martial picture

   he was merely one of the infinitesimal
drab threads that mars had picked up
to weave into the background of the
gigantic pattern of his greatest tapestry
he and his fellows were as necessary
as the army mul but far less picturesque
imported from far canton with thou-
sands of other chinese coolies they
worked like galley slaves at anything
from stevedoring to acting as camp po-
lice for a wage that was no more than
our private soldiers pay and were con-
tent without the soldiers bid for glory
bombed by aeroplanes shelled in back

   founded on a news item in the london post

areas sniped at while trench-digging
they toiled on with all the philosophic
calm of their kind braving even the
leaving of their bones in a strange wild
land from which they would never be
recovered and returned to mix at last
with the dust of their ancestors in the
far flowery kingdom 

  it must be admitted that foo chow
and his companions had joined the most
foreign legion from purely mercenary
motives the why and wherefore of
the titanic struggle affected them not
it was a foreign devils affair in which
they had but a financial interest tar-
tar manchu and internal strife their own
country had known and at last a final
struggle from which it had emerged a
republic but through them all the coolie
had passed as a pawn moved by unseen
hands war to them had been the sport
of kings and rulers from the emper-
or to the taipings better the pick
and shovel of a foreign devil laborer
than the sword pike or musket of a
masterly mandarin whose only pay was
the trivial loot of their own people after
he had skimmed the cream here were
rice and tea and mounting pay so that
if one came safely through one might
return to a houseboat of ones own on
the yangtze river or the honorable posi-
tion of a merchant in a bazaar in one
of the crowded twisted streets of can-
ton city one must join ones ances-
tors sttme time better in an adventure
that would win an honorable future than

to linger behind and drop at last like a
dead lily pad to the muddy bottom of a
logy canal behind the coolie his wife
and children floated on a man-made water
way eking out a bare living with a flock
of ducks the boy tended and a few cor-
morants those falcons of the rivers
which fished for their masters as philo-
sophically as the submissive coolies delved
for the mandarins for their meagre food
either they would remain thus on a
coolie level or he would raise them
with the assistance of many foreign
devils yen to admire him in a mer-
chants cap when he should return tri-
umphant from the dragons field thus
he dreamed behind the imperturbable
mask of his face the faint set smile of
which won many grins from the foreign
devil soldiers who made him the good-
natured butt of their rough jokes

  foo chow they particularly singled out
because of his willingness to do any-
thing that came to his hand no mat-
ter what was required of him his un-
varying reply was can do if the
short-handed cook at the mess tent want-
ed brought over from the commissary a
load that looked too much for two men
to handle foo chow somehow got under
it with his cheerful can do and tee-
tered off if the doughboys wanted their
clothes washed they naturally singled
out foo chow for the imposition and
though he might have toiled like a galley
slave through a long trying day he
would smilingly accept the added burden
with his invariable can do if with
the filth mud and grime of a long ses-
sion in the trenches the rest billet got
into the condition of an augean stables
the cleaning of it was always assigned
to this diminutive yellow hercules who
accepted the unenviable commission with
his philosophical can do for foo chow
had the sort of faith in himself that
moves mountains and if someone had
asked him to go and fetch the moon
habit no doubt would have prompted
him to reply without the least hesitation

can do and immediately start upon
the mission confident of his ability to
get the satellite

  now the doughboys resting after a
stretch of active service have a rough
and unintentionally inconsiderate humor
and they very naturally turned foo
chows super-willingness to their pleas-
ure as well as profit he became a sort
of serious unconscious comedian for
them so long as there was nothing to
which he would not answer can do
they took the keenest delight in putting
him up to the impossible

  when a refractory mule went on a
strike and refused to submit to the galling
trappings of labor one of the teamsters
insisted that even foo chow could not
harness him can do replied that
individual with his usual alacrity and
the stubborn courage of an inborn pride
in his ability to accomplish anything
he was rescued from the rash attempt
with some difficulty but several hours
later he appeared with a chastened and
subdued quadruped and a triumphant
can do though how the task had been
accomplished was something that for-
ever remained a chinese puzzle to the
would-be jokers

  the engineers in dull moments were
given to sending him on long trips back
to the supply station to get left-handed
monkey wrenches back-cutting saws
and all the other supposedly humorous
impossibilities that have done such time-
honored service and many were the
arguments in spluttering pidgin english
in which foo chow indulged while try-
ing to live up to his much vaunted can
do the camp cooks looking to escape
labor would insist that foo could not
cook this or that and he would indig-
nantly refute the allegation to his nick-
name by an immediate demonstration
no matter how much extra time he put
in at the expense of his own meagre
leisure in vain his shrewder country-
men would point out to him the folly
of his ways foo chow had his pride
thomas grant springer



to sustain and accomplishment seemed
to him the clearest form of silencing
denial

  but pride goeth before a fall and foo
chows confidence in himself at last
proved to be his own undoing a series
of smashing blows had advanced the
front lines some distance and the rear
moved up over the retiring foes devasta-
tion it was a busy time for foo and
his fellow-workers roads were to be
rebuilt old trenches leveled ruined walls
pulled down and the litter and clutter
of the battlefield collected for salvage
as order began to come out of chaos
and the troops settled down into their
newly won positions those returning to
the back areas for rest naturally relaxed
and were ripe for mischief it was on
foo chow that they immediately picked
finding him alone digging out a dis-
mantled field gun from a wrecked trench
one of them winking at his brothers
insisted that it was too bad that the gun
could not be gotten back to their billet
for a souvenir as was intended this
proved to be a challenge to foo chow

  can do he insisted promptly though
the gun was far too heavy once it
had been detached from the smashed car-
riage to have been carried by two or
even three men

  like hell you can remarked the
joker in a purposely doubting tone
wed take it back ourselves if we did-
nt have our packs no chink could
ever get it in alone 

  can do insisted foo chow stub-
bornly at the same time weighing the
gun with a speculative eye

  yes you cannot do persisted his
tormentor and the others laughed a
derisive echo

  that was enough while the group
grinned and giggled foo chow tugged
and strained hunched his shoulder under
the metal tube and with legs that wob-
bled protestingly managed to heave him-
self up beneath his burden and teeter
off over the rough ground all but stag-

gering but goaded on to his goal by th
laughing doughboys trailing behind him
every moment they expected him to drop
it the sweat stood out in bright beads
on his yellow face merged into streams
and trickled down his cheeks off his
nose and across his bent neck his
breath wheezed and whistled his bur-
dened back bowed lower and lower and
his legs shook painfully but urged on
by the doubting comments of his tor-
mentors he struggled on finally arriv-
ing at the stable that served them as a
billet with a mighty sigh of relief he
eased his load to the ground and turned
to them with a triumphant grin

  good old boy they yelled in encour-
agement youre the original old can
do all right

  but the habitual grin faded slowly
from foo chows face into his eyes
crept a dull look of growing pain he
tried to straighten his bowed back then
his features twisted and he put both
hands to his stomach

  belly pletty much jumpie he re-
marked in a puzzled tone then his legs
gave way and he sat down unsteadily
on the gun doubling over on his knees

  the boys became at once concerned
and bent over him with rough kindly
sympathy

  gee the chink hurt himself ill bet
remarked one of them with a guilty note
in his voice hurt much inside eh
foo he asked while the others looked
sheepishly at one another

  belly heap jump replied foo chow
holding the offending member the lines
of pain that distorted his features fist-
ing now to more of a look of indigna-
tion

  ill bet the poor devil busted some-
thing inside we better get him to the
surgeon right away and with worried
haste in spite of his vigorous protest
they bore him away where there would
be no danger of his doing anything for
some time to come

  though foo chow had more inherent


studies in saffron

faith in the dried beetles powdered
snake skins and weird herb concoctions
of the charlatan practitioners of his na-
tive province he submitted himself to the
foreign devil doctor who sent his pa-
tient to a base hospital in the far back
area to lie tightly bandaged and fretfully
inactive behind the smiling inscrutable
mask of a face that showed above the
coarse nightshirt like a yellow full moon
peeping over a white cloud-bank

  the hospital was filled with severe
casualties but those who were approach-
ing convalescence found much to amuse
them in foo chows set grin and humor-
ous pidgin english with the nurses and
doctors too he made himself a great
favorite stoically patient habitually
good-natured blindly obedient his can
do marked him even here in his en-
forced inactivity for if it were a case
of waiting for his dressing to be changed
his food to be served or even a drink
of water when the fever parched him
and the hurried worried nurses would
ask you wait just a little while foo
chow  his answer though it often
taxed him more than anyone least of all
the nurses suspected was always can
do

  the hospital was an old chateau seem-
ingly far enough fjom wars ghastly ac-
tivities to be safe but the enemy bird-
men like carrion vultures must needs
pay it their usual attention every now
and then one of these winged sneaks
escaping through the allied patrol
marked it for his target the ears of
the patients quickened by danger grew
to recognize the hum of friend or foe
and the nurses and attendants stood
ready at almost any time to herd or carry
their patients into the deep cellar when
occasion required the hospital like all
others being pitifully shorthanded the
less severe cases helped or carried their
more unfortunate brothers in affliction
to the comparative safety of the far
downstairs just before foo chows
arrival there had been several scares

that had strung the nerves of all the in-
mates up to the highest tension a
playful airman had sown the flower beds
with bombs and it was a settled convic-
tion among the patients that he would
come back some day or night and rec-
tify his error in judgment

  the sorely worried nurse warned her
oriental patient of this danger and gave
him minute instructions as to reaching
the cellar his ward being on the second
floor foo chow listened with his usual
respectful attention but no apparent in-
terest

  we have so much trouble with the
patients who cant walk she concluded
if the airman he come you think you
can get down there alone

  allee light replied foo chow quiet-
ly can do and apparently dismissed
the matter entirely from his mind

  but as the uneventful days went on
with no return visit the ward grew less
apprehensive foo chow comfortable
as long as he lay in one position but not
being able to read and handicapped by
his lack of fluent english grew restless
the nurse had some difficulty in keeping
him to his bed and from getting up and
wandering about the ward quiet being
the one thing now necessary to overcome
the strain he had undergone

  now foo you must promise me you
will not get up and try to walk you
know inside all broken up-you try to
walk now you break him all more then
you never walk at all again she warned

  no no can do now belly he no
more jump um foo would insist but
the nurse and the doctor were obdurate
and so foo chow obedient by nature
and custom lay outwardly still but in-
wardly planning the many things that he
still thought he could do

  it was just about this time that the
hun birdman took to play a return date
there was a full moon to aid him in his
dastardly work and he came humming
over like a gigantic dragon-fly the pa-
tients recognizing from afar the drone
thomas grant springer



of a hostile engine began a scrambling
out of their beds marshaled by the
nurses and assistants and made what
haste they could to the semi-safety of
the cellar those less seriously injured
began picking up their helpless comrades
some in their arms others on mattresses
some assisted others to hobble or stag-
ger and the sorry procession made what
pitiful haste it could to avoid a double
disaster short numbered the nurses
rushed frantically here and there striv-
ing to help as many as possible but for
all they could do there were too few to
remove the helpless without several trips
and so many had to be left to pray si-
lently in their beds that they might be
missed

  at the first sign of confusion foo
chow woke to sudden life his small
slitted eyes began to twinkle with an
almost joyful excitement the faint set
grin that was his habitual expression
widened into a full smile he was out
of bed on the instant a ludicrous figure
had there been but time in that trying
moment to notice it his brown feet pad-
ding along the bare floor in vivid con-
trast to the coarse white nightgown that
hung above them at a ridiculous angle

  walla malla he inquired almost ex-
citedly of the one-armed occupant of the
next bed who gray of face and cursing
violently between clenched teeth was
holding his bandaged stump with his one
hand as he made for the door of the hall

  damned boche aviator he growled
casting a baleful eye aloft you better
beat it chinkie before he begins to drop
his cursed load on us he staggered
hurriedly away as the humming above
them began to grow viciously louder

  foo chow did not hurry he knew
that sound well this was not the first
time that the foreign devils dragon-
flies had showered him with their bombs
and stink-pots but here there was work
to do men more helpless than himself
to help to safety and without hesitation
unmindful for once of die nurses and

-l s

doctors orders he made for the nearest
bed and gathered up a soldier into his
arm

  just then the nurse caught sight of
him

  no no she cried rushing to him
as he started for the door with his bur-
den you cant do that foo put him
down and get away yourself i

  can do can do insisted foo with-
out waiting for farther argument he
started out into the hall and down the
stair for the cellar with his now uncon-
scious burden

  just as he gained the ground floor the
first bomb fell missing the building nar-
rowly but shaking the place to its very
foundations as it exploded in the yard
foo chow was in the cellar almost be-
fore the vibrations ceased he deposited
his burden and made a dash back up the
stairs circling the hun now tried
again this time he struck a wing shat-
tering it but missing the main building
through the smoke and confusion the
groans and cries of the men left behind
or being borne below foo chow tot-
tered selected his second burden and
had the man in his arms before he was
noticed by any one in authority this
time it was the doctor himself laden who
yelled impatiently at him

  here foo chow put that man down
you fool youre in a bad way your-
self r

  can do foo chow insisted toiling
out without a thought of pause although
by now he felt the strain felt the sudden
giving way of something inside just as
it had done on the day that they had
brought him to the hospital but there
was work to be done he was back upon
the job and though his legs tottered
weakly under him he managed with
great effort to get his second man to
safety and start back

  the hun had circled again almost
directly above them now the engine was
humming louder as if he had dived
down to makensure of a direct hit in


the return

the far corner foo chow noted a bed
the white-faced occupant of which was
vainly trying to rise just as he made
for him the bomb struck fair plunged
through the roof and exploded in the
room with a blinding flash and a crash-
ing scattering of deadly fragments
there wa a moment of paralysis among
all of them while the smoke cleared one
of the nurses who had been thrown to
her knees rose unsteadily and noticed
foo chow standing upright and perfect-
ly motionless amid the tangled wreck-
age upon his usually imperturbable
face was an expression of puzzled in-
credulity and he looked down with
amazed eyes at the spreading stain soil-
ing the immaculate whiteness of his
coarse night garment then he raised
his head looked with a sudden smile at
the waiting white face in the corner bed
and toddled toward it

  the nurse realizing he had been badly
hit was after him as fast as she could
go but before she reached him foo
chow had his third burden in his arms
and was moving with it somewhat un-
steadily now toward the hall door

  foo foo chow put that man down
the nurse commanded youre hurt
yourself  you must not-

  all light all light-can do he in-
sisted and teetered out and down the
stairs wavering somewhat uncertainly
but gathering all his strength to reach
the cellar with his burden

 the nurse had to turn back others
demanded her immediate attention
there was the crash of another bomb
and yet another and through the smoke
the wreck and the confusion the groans
and cries of those stricken demanded
her aid above them the venomous
humming faded into the distance afhe
cowardly destroyer sped off under the
stars that blinked as if to shut out the
shameful sight of him from the eyes of
his victims

 again foo chow entered the room
now his steps lagged the stain upon
his nightshirt had widened and spread
the yellow of his face had faded to a
pasty gray and over his dull eyes a film
was spreading clearing it away with a
backward brush of his hand he looked
about the room for another of his com-
rades to be carried below he started
unsteadily toward a still occupied bed
just as he reached it the nurse turned to
see him sway crumple and collapse with
groping hands that still stretched out in
their work of rescue as she gained his
side he made a pitiful effort to get upon
his feet but weakness conquered the im-
pulse he looked up into her face for a
moment with something of the old smile
upon his now colorless lips then his
gaze fell to the slow spreading stain on
his breast he shook his head weakly
the tired eyes closed the lips struggled
to frame the last words no-can-
do

illusions

 by roger hartman

nothing had ever seemed so
completely absurd to porter
cresson as marcia playres re-
iterated statement that years had built
a barrier between them which love could
not brush away forget ignore obliterate
her strangely passive attitude toward
what seemed to him an obstacle utterly
contemptible was the one flaw he found
in her amazing power of clear reason-
ing the swift sure straight thrusts of
her thought which were an endless de-
light to him schooled as he was to con-
sider women in the mass as creatures
of emotion and impulse-beings whose
nearest approach to intelligence was an
intuition compounded nine parts of de-
sire and one part of hope with a trace
perhaps of fear

  it was because marcia really thought
as he thought really dissociated herself
and her prejudices and desires from her
mental processes that he had first con-
sidered her as distinct from a world of
women who were no more to him than
more or less pleasing components of a
great natural color scheme it was as
if a man used to finding a mild pleasure
in the contemplation of an autumn hill-
side content to consider its crimsons
umbers chromes and greens as splashes
of color agreeably stimulating to the reti-
nal nerves should suddenly discover one
leaf to be surpassingly individual vivid-
ly and intimately alive a quiveringly
sensitive being reacting as he reacted

  his first attitude had been that of the
involuntary discoverer he found him-
self a columbus standing on the shore
of a new continent the thrill of it un-

diminished by pre-calculations an acci-
dental astronomer before whose unex-
pecting eye a glorious new planet swam
into view instinct gave him the pro-
prietory tone of all discoverers toward
their discoveries he had found her
she was his it was a simple proposition
in elementary male logic and marcia
with her deep clear understanding eyes
softly touched with humor read his mind
and as a mother enters into the play-
world of her child suffered him to cling
to his illusion for all the splendid in-
dependence of her the fine passion of
self-ownership which had kept her free
of lifes entangling alliances she let this
man dream that he had some title in
her which took precedence even of her
own

   discoverers have always been just a
 little prone to ignore the prior patents
 of the aborigines she did not quarrel

	with porter cressons naive establish-
 ment of a protectorate being marcia
 playre it was given her to see beyond
 the mans boyish bent for strut and
 parade to know and value the clean
 fine honest soul of him perhaps even
 then she understood that she was to love
 him as only the marcia playres may
 love-with clear eyes that penetrate il-
 lusion and a courageous spirit that knows
 how soon and in what ashen bitterness
 the flowers fade

   i am trying to be just toward porter
 cresson and it is less difficult than i
 had fancied it would be there was no
 malice in him then or later as far as
 a man may be the thing men mean when
 they say the word gentleman cresson




illusions

deserved the name and still deserves it
even in those bad days when i felt the
old savage lust of murder stir in me at
the sight of him i loved him i think
he was a mans man he did not know
that women loved him and if he had
found it out it would have shamed him
hurt him he was-and is-a living
refutation of the absurd lie that women
love pretty men for if his mother had
found him beautiful in his infancy she
must have been self-deceived beyond the
limits of maternal bias

  let me sketch him for you as i have
him roughly crayoned in my portfolio
of drawings that i only see i have
spread that crude portrait on the desk
before me to be translated into words
instead of lines if i could only make
you see him through my eyes it would
be so much easier to explain what hap-
pened porter cresson in the flesh
would make you acquit him as i acquit
him and like him as i like him

  think then of the big brown bear
the great amiable friendly bear of your
fairy books of baloo teacher of the
pack law to the cubs of seonee dress
him in gray homespuns that are always
immaculate always meticulously fresh
and creased and yet which seem to multi-
ply the burliness the overgrown boy-
muscles of thigh and shoulder shave
him to an olive skin darken its tint with
the burn of suns and add a glow of sav-
age health give him a wide friendly
elemental mouth quick to reveal teeth
that are almost a bears-short unde-
veloped incisors and prominent menac-
ing cuspids projecting well below the line
give him wide deeply recessed eyes be-
low heavy brows which meet above the
wide low-bridged big nostriled nose
give him a forehead that slopes sharply
back to thick soft hair growing in a
clear-defined widows peak hair that is
always brushed sleekly back lying very
smooth and flat and yet leaves always
an impression of shagginess when you
think of it afterward

  yes more than a hint of cave-man
as you have already told yourself but
there is no such impression when you
see porter cresson he radiates an aura
of mental alertness that is almost gro-
tesque in its contradiction to his physical
type you cannot hear him tlkwithout
knowing that he is one of the rare men
who can think incisively without making
cynics of themselves men who have
warm emotions below glacial brains
fine generous impulses forever combating
remorseless scientific logic you must
think of him as a man who would take
almost the same delight in a sharply
fought game of chess as in a bear-romp
with crowing children or a rough-and-
tumble wrestling bout with a lumber-
jack you must conceive him as a joy-
ous football player delighting in the rud-
est shock of straining bodies and still
guiding his stone-age muscles with the
cold detached intelligence of a twentieth-
century scientist plotting his attack and
defense to the most trivial detail and
playing like a berserk viking

  make him quick with sympathy eager-
ly generous give him a tact that is al-
most uncanny and then send him through
princeton and cambridge and let him
spend a year or two finding himself in
the inner circle of painters and players
and thinkers that a few very lucky men
find waiting to welcome them at paris
give him too a striking success for his
first effort at letters a well-deserved po-
sition of authority in a field in which
few men succeed before they have passed
fifty if you can visualize charm give
him more of it than any man you have
ever known thus you will have a fair
idea of porter cresson and perhaps you
will understand why i have never
learned to hate him-even now when
he detests me and is certain his detesta-
tion is well founded

  marcia that is not so easy there
are scores of sketches of her in my port-
folio but each of them is no more than
a beginning abandoned before it was
roger hartman



well begun it is no more possible to
put marcia into lines and shadows and
lights than to paint a star star-that
is the best key-word there is some-
thing starlike about her something of
the distance the ineffable pathos that
surround the unattainable something

i too of the purity that only a star seems
i fitted to typify the weakness of the
 simile is its cheapness every towheaded
iwench since the race learned to grunt
jan embryo speech has made somebody
think of a star i can do no better but
vyou must imagine a star different from
jany other ever used for purposes of
comparison - a higher clearer more
ethereally luminous star than any you
can see in the sky to-night or if you
are young enough perhaps you can envi-
tsion marcia playre by giving her name
to the dream woman you hope to find
and love before you die it doesnt mat-
ter whether her eyes are blue orgray
or her hair flax or red or midnight black
   you wouldnt inquire the specific
gravity of your star would you

  i brought porter cresson to marcia
rlt seems incredible now that i should
mot have foreseen what must inevitably
row out of that encounter i knew
vmarcia as a man sometimes comes to
know the woman he loves with a hope-
lessness so complete that it keeps his
secret even from such eyes as marcia
playres i used to be glad in those days
that marcia didnt know if she had
jknown she would have sent me away
-for my souls sake but she did not
and i after i had seen for myself that
ithere was that in porter cresson which
rmade a womans heart quicken at the
sight of him brought him to marcia-
marcia the star-woman fatuously cock-
-sure that no woman of six-and-thirty
ineed fear an overgrown bear-boy twelve
years younger by the calendar and twelve
hundred centuries younger in that age
of the soul that is understanding oh
i didnt even think about it-it would
have impressed me then as being quite

as needless as to worry over the results
of letting the aphrodite of melos meet
john keats

  cresson was blind to her beauty mar-
cia had the kind of loveliness which
is in the blue of a september sky too
perfect to advertise itself to obtrude
insistently on the senses and cresson
was taken off his feet from the first in-
stant by his discovery that she could
think he has the type of brain which
is closed against simultaneous impres-
sions-he has room for only one idea
at a time i doubt if he had any clear
mental image of marcias face when he
came up to my rooms after that first
visit to spend half the night telling me
about her mind

  can you see him filling my biggest
chair so that it seemed absurdly frail
blazing at me with the vivid words he
chose like a master of speech and
alight with the miracle of a woman whom
the gods had seen fit to endow with a
brain i remember smiling tolerantly
at him and thinking what a wonderful
thing it was to be young enough to have
enthusiasms  i suppose i looked a
hundred years old to him    he talked
to me as if i wrere an innocent bystander

   i was thirty-eight then

  his confidences were rather hard to
bear as he grew to understand marcia 
for no better reason i think than that
i had introduced them he chose me from
the very beginning as the repository of
his emotional processes he twitched at
my sleeve as a vivisector might to urge
me toward the operating table on which
he dissected his soul-dissected it like
the genius he was with an uncanny sure-
ness of hand but with savage ruthless-
ness it revolted me but with the hyp-
nosis that horror can exert on the least
sanguinary fascinated me it was only
when he began dissecting marcia that i
stopped him short i couldnt bear
that   

  still i heard enough it was no more
than a question of years that lay between


illusions

              them within a week afr i took him to	those of the boy who loved her i think

              her blue and silver room that looked out	that she always knew what the end must

            on the plane-trees twelve years-i	be that cressons blazing eloquence

             could understand how terrible they must	never convinced her something she

              seem to marcia against the boys vivid	said to me before the shadow came told

              youth how deadly they were to her now	me the truth of that
              that she had become conscious of time happiness isnt it only a reflection

                 there had been moments when i	after all is there a positive happiness

              had envied her the two years that lay	jim i think its only what one sees in

             between my age and hers marcia	the eyes of somebody one loves   
             playre to whom time had been no more i knew then what she meant she

             than a fourth dimension to whom the	married cresson not because she hoped

              years were friends whose passing left	to trick the years but because she saw

              softly blessed memories and no regrets	that in making him a god in his own be-

              -marcia facing at last the bitter lesson	lief she would know happiness by the

             of age-at six-and-thirty how she	divine indirection of her service she

             would hate them those months that had	married him as a girl would have mar-

            tricked her into thinking them her	ried him-flinging away her fears and

               friends as little by little they carried	her doubts plunging recklessly into his

          youth from her	madness giving him fire for fire song

             yet she saw the truth clearly enough	for song laugh for laugh she made

              from cressons vivid recitals of the ar-	herself his mate in youth in the magni-

              guments he marshaled against her i	ficent folly of it the glow and blaze and

              could reconstruct her thought he did	glad abandon of it i watched her mar-

               not violate her confidence but he told me	veling    she turned her back on the

              without knowing it just how she opposed	sunset and on me and raced back toward

            him i knew her so well you see	the morning laughing sped back to

              yes i was glad that she was old it	where cresson waited for her
              had been hard enough to face the truth i found some plausible excuse for

              that she would never care for me except	being far away when they were married

              with the placid dilute friendliness that	in my self-centred blindness i thought

             tortured while it fascinated me now	that she would mark my absence and

              to find her wakened by this boy respond-	guess its reason i reproached myself

              ing to the pagan youth and fire of him	for risking a shadow on her day later

             as if she had been a woman of his own	i laughed as an old wise man laughs

             crude epoch-it was enough to make me	at his boys importance marcia would

              fiercely glad that she saw that barrier	not have seen me on that day if i had

             for what it was and would not yield	cut my throat before her in the very

            youth turns to youth   	aisle she had found the way back into

             she knew of course she knew the	that cruel eden of youth the mystery

              years that waited for her were the blood-	that makes a solitude for two in the

               less ones the evil days of the psalmist	midst of many the paradise that is more

              she had learned at last of the bitterness	a paradise because the whole world is

              which takes no pleasure in the morning	relentlessly shut out of it i found out

              and sees only the foreshadow of death in	long afterward that she believed i had

             the dusk    and the years that lay	stood among the guests and seen her

             before cresson-ah the years that leap	marry cresson

             and pulse and laugh in a world of youth i watched them both somehow now

              and love marcia knew the ever-widen-	that the thing was done i lost my bitter-

             ing gulf between her to-morrows and	ness i wanted marcia to win her game
roger hartman



looking on -from my place above the
playground i almost prayed that she
might win-and with only gladness i saw
her steadily winning i even came to
like cresson again because he let her win
because he loved her as crazily after two
years as he had loved her in the first
mad days because not even marcias eyes
could find a hint of waning infatuation
in his attitude

  he must have been less than human
if he had not loved her she gave him
no chance to relax she flung herself
down from her infinite places to become
a temptress a playmate a laughing chal-
lenging elusively maddening mistress of
the sort that a woman must make of her-
self to bea successful wife to such a
man as porter cresson

  the years passed-lightly for them
heavily for me for i was afraid hor-
ribly afraid the difference between
twenty-five and thirty-seven is hard
enough for love to span between twenty-
eight and forty-i could not hope that
even such a love as theirs could bridge
that gulf and i knew marcia when
love died she would die too cresson
would not understand so greatly fear-
ing i stood by it was not easy to look
on there were times when i saw their
eyes meet in a chance roving glance
clash and fasten and glow shutting me
out  no it wasnt easy but i did
it i wanted marcia to feel always that
i stood very close

  cresson as the world knows devel-
oped splendidly in line with his preco-
cious promises his genius found itself
expanded flowered he took a boys de-
light in it a frank unaffected and un-
concealed pleasure in being known ad-
mired respected envied the passionate
youth of him seemed to grow stronger
as he came into the surety of his thirties
he was a pagan still a boy a wild joy-
ous beast-man above or below or beyond
the weakening inhibitions of our degen-
erate age a law to himself i watched
him and gradually i saw him change

under the slow chemistry of time as
other men change saw the tragedy begin
to slip its shadow unperceived above
him

  men who have passed beyond the sinis-
ter line of fifty know too well what it
means to discover a growing inclination
to be critical a deepening discrimination
which at first seems only the result of
knowledge and experience there comes
a time when nature seems to sharpen the
eye and quicken the ear when the mere
prettiness of face or figure the light
laughter of young voices no longer suf-
fice to quicken the pulse when one seeks
something nameless and haunting-be-
yond the superficial a man grows crit-
ical under the years he develops an eye
for trivial blemishes an ear for slight
discords and he turns constantly back-
ward trying to blind himself to the gray-
ness that waits beyond

  cresson was in my rooms when he
woke to himself at least he seemed
to - understand what was happening in
him suddenly under my eyes

  he turned toward me slowly his face
queerly drawn

  my god jim im thirty-one years
old

  i did not smile i remembered too
keenly the thrill of fear that bites through
a man as it dawns on him in one sobering
flash of realization that he isnt a boy
any more that he has been lifted out of
precocity to a footing of equality with
other men when he is no longer meas-
ured relatively but absolutely no longer
a clever youngster but a man-to be
appraised by the standards of all men
young or old

  yes i said i was wondering when
youwould find it out it wont do you
any harm if you keep your balance
youth is relative like everything else

  thats it he said still under the
cold touch of discovery there are-
people whod think me old-

  not so many as those who would
think you still a boy i reminded him


illusions

and could have bitten my tongue at the
careless speech as i saw his thought leap
toward marcia i had wakened his self-
consciousness to the gulf between them
-marcia at three and forty he at thirty-
one 

  he nodded slowly

  thats true enough jim i suppose i
do look like a kid to-to you for in-
stance 

  yes his cruelty showed that he
was still young i managed not to wince
at the heedlessness of that speech yes
cresson when you feel your age getting
oppressive consider me and be com-
forted thats one advantage of choos-
ing your friends out of the earlier gener-
ation

  again i saw his thought flash to his
wife henceforward he would strength-
en his mental grip on youth by contrast-
ing his years with marcias they would
actually comfort him now those twelve
intervening years

  i met them both a few days later at
the moseleys dinner i saw in a flash
that my chance-dropped seed had taken
root ineradicably in porter cresson he
was charmingly thoughtful of marcia-
so obviously solicitous that old mrs
moseley commented on it in her pungent
style for my ear only

  young cressons waking up to mar-
cias age isnt he he couldnt be
more careful of her if she were his
venerable grandmother

  i changed the subject rather pointedly
but the wicked old woman gurgled in
her formidable bass to let me know that
she didnt care whether or no i approved
of her later i saw her repeating the
idea to sally fraser who is more feline
in her instincts than any other woman
of my acquaintance i did the only thing
i could i hung about marcia persist-
ently until she left-quite early cres-
son suggested it fondly reminding her
that shed had a trying day i thought
i saw her flinch a little away from him
as he bent over her i knew what she

was feeling behind those words and
her eyes clung to mine for a moment
as we parted clung with a kind of fright
in them the blind bewildered appeal of
the child who faces new terrifying pain
she needed me and her glance said
so i went home afoot that night think-
ing hard there are moments in any
mans life when he faces quite suddenly
an opportunity that challenges every evil
impulse in him marcia needed me at i
last it was to mine that her eyes had
made that mute appeal over cressons 
shoulder   

  i went to see her next day cresson

i knew would be at his work he al- i
ways drove himself relentlessly at it
until five nothing could get him out of
his study marcia was alone in her
blue and silver room paler than i had
ever seen her-and lovelier she was
more like the marcia i had known be-
fore cresson set her life on fire with the
flame of his pagan youth her hand as
i touched it was cool and gentle and
steady and her eyes were calm as they
had been in the old days

  porters busy she said i knew
that the words merely covered her
thought

  i came to see you i told her i-
im seeking consolation to-day im
fifty and i dont enjoy it

  it was quite safe to add five years to
the truth i am not given to publishing
my personal affairs in such compendiums
as whos who  and if anyone except
my brother in hong kong is aware of
my age i cannot imagine how he dis-
covered it

  marcias eyes widened

  jimmy-youre not she spoke
compassionately before her mind had
time to weigh the words the color
swept into her cheeks as their import
dawned on her but she was marcia-
she did not aggravate the wound by
apologies instead she laughed softly
and dropped her cool fingers on my
wrist
roger hartman



  you mendacious graybeard youve
been deceiving us all for years i thought
you were no older than i there-lets
not talk about it she snapped her
fingers there goes the calendar sit
down and talk to me nicely jim i
havent seen you half enough these last
few months ive missed you

  i lowered myself into a chair as if i
were -seventy i had my part to play
for her and marcias eyes are shrewd
and keen age-age-there was my cue
marcia would be comforted at every
sign of it i showed and if i hoped to
stand by her when the crisis came she
must come to be sure of me again-to
think of me as she had thought of me
before cresson came l could foresee
the ugly rocks that lay before her in
the channel

  i saw her rather often after that i
comforted her you see she kept her
pity out of her eyes and tone but i could
feel it always feel her sense of youth
quicken in her as she regarded me it
is not easy when you are forty-five or
so to have the woman you have loved
for years look toward you as a sort of
bulwark against old age but i knew
that the time was coming when marcia
would need me horribly and i meant to
stand by i had no thought of anything
beyond that service though sometimes
i felt my nerves leap and quiver like a
boys when her hand touched mine

  it was months after that interview
that i stood on the wide flagged terrace
of harry lorings long island palazzo
the sunken formal garden silver and
black under the moon the white marbles
ghost-gray about me and saw the spark
leap from the soul of porter cresson to
the vivid eager youth of edith strang
there was a strange insistent atmos-
phere of unreality about it-the sense
of something theatric staged cleverly
against an obscure background for a
subtle emphasis on the figures and faces
i had foreseen a little of what impended
ever since edith strang had come from

her years abroad a wonderful bit of
human artistry like the intricately per-
fect figurines one finds on old china
a restless fiery spirit in a body that made
me think of a bacchante caught and
prisoned in stays and petticoats i had
known that porter cresson found in her
an appeal that mocked at his honest ef-
forts at resistance the girl herself
surfeited with clieap devotions sur-
rounded by a ludicrously servile crowd
of tailors-dummy males must have felt
and gloried in the combat she stirred in
a man who mattered-a man like cres-
son i liked her she was far above the
hateful habit of small women who snare
men for idle sport it was not her fault
that something in her drew cresson ir-
resistibly nor was it his fault that he was
drawn he was a drowning man he
fought hard and he kept his head above
the waters till that night at lorings
then as the girl slipped through one of
the tall wide windows to the terrace
i saw him follow her there was that
in his eyes that told me he had reached
the end of his strength i went after
them it is a queer conviction that firm
belief that each of us holds it in his
power to avert disaster by his mere pres-
ence it seemed to me that i could stop
the mischief even then

  as i stepped into the shadow of the
wall and looked about for them i saw
it happen she stood motionless in the
clear space by the pool the moon full on
her her head up and back her arms
at her sides a woman waiting unafraid
remorseless and cresson went to her
like a man carried onward in the grip of
some outer force i saw his hands lift
suddenly and hers rise to meet their
groping gesture saw them stand so
frozen into immobility like carved
marble saw them sway together even
a man whose youth is twenty years be-
hind him could understand the force that
moved them into that embrace love
laughs at locksmiths does it what a
feeble saw when love snaps his fin-


illusions

gers faith mocks honor and makes a butt
of god   

  i went back into the blur of casual
rippling speech which sounded jike the
noise of some futile brook after one has
stood transfixed and appalled before the
power and awfulness of niagara some-
body was dissecting the last hand of
bridge there was a little outbreak of
light- laughter from the group where
johnny blent was holding forth untir-
ing buffoon that he will be till he dies
i instinctively looked about for marcia
she needed me now i must find her
find her before she guessed   

  she came in from the terrace as i
searched for her something swelled
achingly in my throat at the sight of
her erect proud smiling that cool re-
mote inscrutable smile that seemed to
lift her above us like a mildly enter-
tained goddess looking down on the
amusing antics of men she had about
her shoulders a wrap of black spanish
lace that made her seem curiously old
for the instant before my eyes met hers
then she came toward me and i saw the
blaze and glow in them and knew that
she was young

  its a night for all the gods jim she
said in her throaty whispering voice
lets have our share of it its blas-
phemy-this electric counterfeit

  we went out i managed to choose
the wst window marcias hand slipped
through the bend of my arm as we
stepped out on the terrace i could feel
that it was steady and her voice was
cool and even and level she must have
seen what i had seen and yet with her
life tumbling in dust and ashes about
her she could laugh in that low cool
music and drink in the penetrating ach-
ing beauty of the night

  i dont know how long we sat on the
old marble seat that harry loring
smuggled out of italy i remember that
some harsh-voiced night bird yawped
dismally in the bulked shadows of the
evergreens and the distant complaint of

surf throbbed eternally in my brain i
was thinking hard seeking a way out-
for marcia i found it at the last with
a stab of self-scorn for my blindness
my time had come for speech-after the
silent years

    it aches doesnt it jimmy-the
moonlight and the night and the blend-
ing voices of it do you feel the pain
in it all does it seem to be telling you
to hurry hurry hurry before life twists
out of your clutch and deserts you with
a mocking taunting chuckle

  i had her hands in mine words came
to me i cannot set them down they
do not matter she understood i should
have been afraid of her clear cool anger
but i was not we had passed beyond
the petty levels where offense is easy
perhaps because i had forgotten that
i loved her as a man loves only once in
his life because i was eager to stand
between her and the rude shock of dis-
illusion awakening she found no injury
in my speech so i sat in the moonlight
and told porter cressons wife that i
loved her and was not ashamed and
did not anger her

  i stopped there was a moment of
black stillness between us a tense strain-
ing instant like the hush that seems to
come before the thunderbolt then mar-
cia laughed it was like some unearthly
sound-her quiet low round laughter
her hands tightened ever so slightly in
mine

  dear old jim do you dream i have-
nt known  i brought you here so that
the moon would make you tell me i-
i wanted to hear-

  i could only grope in a sudden ra-
diance that was more blinding than the
dark for an instant i almost believed
what i wanted to believe-that marcia
cared for me in some mysterious miracle
of transformation then as my uni-
verse cleared i understood marcia
would do exactly this a lesser woman
would have turned to me for spite per-
haps to soothe her wounded pride put
roger hartman



marcia meant to give cresson freedom
in the only way in which such a man
as he might take it at her hands ah
she was clever

 cresson- i managed to say his
name before my throat tightened

  she sighed a little

  it is all right jim he-he doesnt
know but the years have broken what
linked us i am almost forty-three and
he is barely thirty-one he tells him-
self that love still spans that gulf but
-but he is careful not to set his weight
upon the bridge jim i have come to
understand a little better in these later
years there is a difference between
us that isnt in the books a man loves
forward or back-the boy conceives his
passion for a woman and the man as
the years draw down on him for a child
but a woman cant find comfort in the
spectacle of youth    porters youth
is like a constant sneer in my teeth a
woman wants to comfort herself behind
the shelter of anothers age to hug the
thought that she is not so old as some-
one else jim if you had guessed you
would have told me long ago i have
wanted you so-so terribly

  i sat very still she would have made
an actress such as no stage ever held
knowing that she lied knowing that
every word and tone was false i all but
believed her women-the best and the
worst-are infinitely more cruel than
men she reminded me of the wife in
some shaw play-the eternal feminine
who tells her youthful suitor that she
would cook him for her husbands sup-
per without qualm she knew that i
loved her and she coolly used that love
to shield her man from the reproach of
his conscience for deserting her she
would have ordered me flung to the lions
as lightly as she played on the soul of
me  i knew she was marcia
playre and i loved her more because
i knew there is the paradox of love
i adored her more utterly than ever
now that i was wholly sure that she could

  watch me torn in pieces without a quiver
if my destruction served the man she
loved

  my mind worked swiftly in that mo-
ment how did she dare choose this
expedient did she think that i could
be hoodwinked like the pathetic old fel-
lows of french farce or did she really
contemplate the sacrifice of herself  i
krjew she could not marcia playre
might sin splendidly but she would never
sneak or cheat or steal then i guessed
she thought me fifty-and fifty meant
age unspeakable to her for all her near-
ness to its sinister boundary-line i was
dear old jimmy in my dotage  a man
who might need a nurse a daughter
but no wife i looked ahead measur-
ing the cost fifty when you come to
it my cocksure friend you will discover
for yourself that your illusion of youth
is stronger than at thirty now you are
young without thought or endeavor at
fifty you will be young because you will
cling passionately to the conviction that
you are young i knew what i should
pay for taking marcia at her word i
think the martyrdom began in that still
moment on the ancient roman marble

  i played my part convincingly i think
i was the calm old lover to the very
life i kissed her hands gently and still
more gently kissed the cheek she turned
to my lips i spoke softly calmly of
the autumn days of life of indian sum-
mer suns she seemed to understand
for she leaned affectionately against me
relaxing confidently in my arms her cool
cheek pressed to mine for just a mo-
ment i lost my rigid grip on myself
my arms tightened and my lips found
hers a kind of phantom youth throbbed
in me-the madness of the spring does
not die when the leaves turn then i
was frightened because she lay so still
and silent in my arms i must not alarm
her with the spectral apparitions of that
youth she believed long dead and safely
sepulchered in the years   

we told cresson together it wasnt


illusions

hard for me at least i knew how
mercifully his release would come to
him how every fibre of him would thrill
at this escape with honor from his prison
from first to last he behaved beauti-
fully controlling the savage exultation
that strove to find utterance in his voice
avoiding the pretense of resentment and
grief which a less sensitive man would
have employed as a mask under the cir-
cumstances he was very calm about
it very gentle not too forgiving toward
me and with no reproach for marcia

  we cant help these things he said
philosophically ive always been afraid
that this would come you two knew
each other so long before i came-you
have too much in common you mustnt
be too sorry for me marcia it-it stings
of course but the real loss of you came
long ago-i felt it even while you tried
to hide it from me fm sensible enough
to know that these wounds heal very
nicely

  yours is healed now porter mar-
cia spoke softly if i had not known
that this could not hurt you i should
have played the game out but its best
for both of us and your common-sense
is telling you so at this very moment
we are cutting the lines before they
have degenerated into shackles before
either of us has learned to hate them

  yes cresson laughed rather harsh-
ly yes thats so marcia were do-
ing that and as you say it may be
best for both of us

  he ignored me except for monosyl-
labic answers to direct questions but
when he left us he shook hands and i
fancied that i felt a faintly grateful pres-
sure in his grip i got away soon after-
ward i dared not trust myself too
long in my unsupported role of fatherly
guardian and friend

  we managed the details as decently
as such things can be managed in a
country which demands that its laws be
cheated marcia went west and when
her residence had been established sued

  for divorce on the usual fictitious ground
of incompatibility naturally cresson
did not defend the action he had gone
abroad almost at once this was not
surprising edith strang had fled within
a week after that night at lorings i
stayed at home and answered marcias
letters she wrote wonderfully well i
have never found another woman who
so fully possessed the fine art of the let-
ter and she innocently twisted the knife
in me by writing as if she cared i could
see her carefully choosing her words
like the artist she was deliberately play-
ing her chosen role at long distance it
was not easy to answer in the proper
key i labored over every line i wrote
her during those eight months

  she wired me when the decree was
issued it was a curious message that
breathless string of unpunctuated words
i guessed that she meant it as an invita-
tion bvut to me it read like a command
i loathe traveling especially the exag-
gerated brobdingnagian business of
travel as we know it in america--rail-
way journeys that are as long by clock
and calendar as transatlantic voyages
and infinitely longer so far as the way-
farers endurance is concerned but i
bought my passage and went obediently
submissively i had had time to think
i knew quite well that i vas being
utilized as a sort of living ointment for
porter cressons self-esteem he was
tired of his wife his wife knew it and
wished to give him his freedom she
knew that he would not accept it as a
gift however freely offered his pride
his sensitive conception of noblesse
oblige demanded that he stand by his
bargain to the end but to grant her
request to stand back and give her up
magnificently to the man she preferred
to make her happy and lift his old com-
rade meaning me to the plane of semi-
divinity-here was a heroic part at which
his boys instinct for the limelight
snatched greedily he was sidney car-
ton doing his far far better thing with-
roger hartman



out the inconvenient sequel of going to
a far far better rest he could have
all the sensations of self -immolation and
then rubbing off the grease-paint and
hanging the powdered wig on its block
could put a gardenia in his button-hole
tilt back his topper and drive in a beau-
tiful limousine to what welcome waited
him ches madesmoiselle strang all of
which marcia saw quite as clearly as i
did to secure it for her darling she
was perfectly willing to butcher a dozen
sober-sided old adorers like me and her-
self into the bargain still i went one
good point about being fifty is that one
learns to do with half-loaves rather
nicely

  we were married-a bleak civil cere-
mony in an ugly law-office-a week after
the decree had been signed marcia wore
traveling things and looked quite pleas-
ant about it she sent a cable to cresson
from the railway station

  i want him to know its final-a
closed chapter she explained she
would have had me help her with the
composition of that cable but i managed
to avoid it i was having a touch of
gout you see gout seemed to be the
most suitable ailment-aristocratic mod-
erately painful-and beautifully sugges-
tive of aging decrepitude besides one
can travel with it-in a compartment i
had read up on the symptoms and i flat-
tered myself that i was convincing in
the part at least marcia hovered over
me with a charming solicitude all the way
east women i think enjoy little ill-
nesses in others

  it was rather hard to remember that
she was my wife i kept thinking of
her as porter cressons wife thanking
her as one thanks a friendly outsider for
little services it wasnt pleasant to look
ahead and see myself feigning old age
until i no longer needed to pretend-i
believe i ventured to construct air-castles
in which marcia would presently dis-
cover that she always had cared for me
air-castles in which i was permitted to

resume my proper self to be as young
and eager and foolish as i felt but i
knew that they were only dreams srch
things dont happen

  there was a cable for marcia at new
york i knew it would be from cresson
and i knew too what was in it she
showed it to me as we drove to the pier
-my poor foot lifted carefully to the op-
posite seat of the cab

  congratulations to you both edith
and i married yesterday

porter

  i managed to appear surprised mar-
cia evidently expected it of me she
folded the flimsy sheet small and tore it
meditatively letting the fragments flut-
ter through the window i tried not to
look at her but her silence drew my eyes
against my will i could see her profile
touched with a distant sadness that hurt
me horribly but there was nothing i
could do i complained fretfully about
an entirely mythical twinge in my foot
she leaned forward and adjusted the
cushion skilfully it took two porters to
assist me up the gangplank and along the
deck i saw that it was best to risk
overplaying my part marcia needed
something to distract her nursing is a
sovereign anodyne for feminine heart-
aches i saw her lips twitch a little as i
collapsed into the chair where my porters
deposited me i had a sudden horrible
fear that she was going to let go if she
cried-if marcia cried-i knew that i
shouldnt be able to keep my little secrets
under that test

  the door closed i heard the clink
of silver as marcia tipped the men for
safetys sake i had shut my eyes and was
leaning back behaving as much like the
interesting invalid as i could there was
an interlude of silence then so sud-
denly that i gasped and stared marcia
pulled away my foot-rest and let my
falsely petted foot drop with a thud on
the carpet it was so unexpected that i


after renunciation

forgot to yelp until it was too late she
stood watching me her lips straight and
tight but her eyes starrier than i had
ever seen them

  you old fraud-how long were you
going to keep it up forever

  she was sitting on the arm of the chair
now and her hands had seized liberal
locks of my hair playfully menacing
she tugged spitefully till i seized her
wrists in self-defense    marcias
wrists-my wifes

   it is a far far better thing that i
do  she quoted in marcias own voice
the old laughing understanding voice i
loved if you could have seen yourself
jimmy-strutting to the guillotine like a
matinee idol did you really think i
was doing it for him didnt you ever
guess that it was all the other way
why when i saw him kiss that strang
child that night at lorings i nearly

cheered i knew that he would have to
wake without my waking him he honest-
ly believed he cared as much for me as
ever-until that night jim jim ive
tried so hard to play the game id
taken his youth you see lived on his
ideals his boyishness his illusions-and
grown tired of them i couldnt drop
him like a squeezed orange could i i
had to be sure first- she sighed
wearily oh how tired i got jim
youll never know what a job it is to stay
young when you want to be comfortably
middle-aged-and that wasnt the worst
of it i-i discovered you jimmy-af-
ter all those silly wasted years i
knew   

  every story ends somewhere i sup-
pose mine ends here but its my con-
viction in spite of everything that im
still at the beginning the calendar says
-it doesnt matter what it says-it lies

after renunciation

by anna spencer twitchell

j have not let him know my love

nor put its rapture in a song

          but with stern guard on lips and eyes

          i have been strong

          i have shut out his prayers and turned

          blindly from his dear arms and kiss-

         oh i have found someway somehow
         courage for this

oh road whereon he lonely walks

oh sailing moon a silver rim

          oh winds and clouds and stars to-night
          be kind to him
envy-a new poison

                 by cleveland moffett

for centuries preachers have warned
us against envy hatred malice
and all uncharitableness but
now the scientists begin

  envy is literally a poison they say
just as anger hatred and fear are liter-
ally poisons when we yield to these
passions we change the chemistry of our
bodies and produce in our vital organs
evil secretions that can be detected by
laboratory methods and that cause stom-
ach troubles kidney troubles and other
serious ills a man may become a vic-
tim of diabetes for example through
jealousy or through anger

  in view of this discovery let us take
a fresh glance at our ancient enemy-
envy what does the great teacher say

  a prophet is not without honor save
in his own country

  why is that

  it is because people who knew the
prophet when he was not a prophet are
envious they will not stand for his ac-
cession to greatness they remember
him as little jimmy blank with freckles
and a pug nose who used to run away
from school and go swimming he a
prophet never

  how prone we are to doubt the abil-
ities and distrust the motives of those
who have emerged from an obscurity
that they once shared with us

  we do not mind how many great and
brilliant things happen to strangers--
they may inherit millions or strike oil
in their back yards or become governors
of states without its troubling us but
let one of these things happen to an ac-
quaintance and we immediately resent it

  we read that a multi-millionaire has
died and left a long list of bequests to
people of whom we never heard-half
a million to this one a hundred thousand
to that one fifty thousand to another
and we take it calmly but if we read
that he has bequeathed ten thousand dol-
lars to some hard-working secretary
whom we know we regard it as a per-
sonal insult

  what that poor stiff ten thou-
sand dollars  the idea

  let some newspaper man make a hit
with a play that represents years of
brave striving of self-denial or repeated
disappointment and what happens do
other newspaper men crowd around him
with congratulations  not so that you
would notice it the congratulations
come mostly from strangers

  we go to a distant city and hear high
praise for a man we have known for
years what that fellow a great
artist a distinguished scientist an-
international authority on this or that
absurd and we recall something to
his discredit

 alas how envious we are how
envious women are listen to their
talk and this envy reacts against our-
selves

  a real test of character comes when
we meeta friend-at dinner or on the
street-who has had good fortune pro-
fessional success a public distinction
then what it is so easy to be indif-
ferent to pass the thing over as of slight
importance or to speak some flippant
wounding word

  good god is not life a hard enough




the time for dreams

pilgrimage without our wantonly adding
to the blows and hurts that each one of
us must bear

  let us resolve to honor the prophets
including the minor prophets who may
be near us not only for their sake but
for our own

  remember that the beautiful flowers
in our hearts can never flourish or come
to full bloom unless we root out the poi-
son weeds of envy

  dont wait until your friend is dead

before you give him the credit that is
his due acknowledge his fine achieve-
ments his industry his high purpose
do it now praise him if he deserves
praise speak generously of him to
others rejoice with him when fortune
smiles when triumphs come be sin-
cere about it be happy about it and by
so doing you will win smiles of fortune
for yourself

  and you will gain in health

  that is the law

the time for dreams

by l m thornton

t st little maid with the eager feet
and the tender eyes of blue

laugh while the world seems glad and sweet
sing while you think it true

          gather roses and lilies fair

dance with the dancing streams

keep your heart while you can from care
youth is the time for dreams

         list little maid with the waving hands
         and the plaited golden hair

        one in the wide world understands
        all that you do and dare

         one is glad for your eager heart
         and your smile that ever gleams

         yours is of life the golden part

youth is the time for dreams

list little maid with the faith sublime
and the trust that angels know

         griefs may lie in the lap of time
         and your bounding step grow slow
         but one who wearies of stress and strife
         and of joy not all it seems

is glad from the depths of his jaded life
that youth is the time for dreams

             souvenir de guerre

          by robert w sneddon

nother said monsieur gra-
vault the apothecary as the
bursting of a shell broke in upon
the game of chess

  bigre that sounded nearer
monsieur chautards voice was even
thinner than usual and the hand that
hovered over the board trembled

  come come my friend gravault
counseled him with a sly twinkle in his
eyes attention this is all the battle
we are fit for-a couple of old crocks
laid on the shelf

  chautard sighed and lighted his ciga-
rette the process seemed to trouble
him for he hesitated before blowing out
the match

  a comfortable shelf you have any-
way he said looking about the room
with its heavy hangings its tall clock
polished floor and solid stiff furniture

  it will last its time assented gra-
vault after i am gone my brother
the antique dealer in paris will be glad
enough to have it meanwhile it is your
move you are slow to-day

  chautard shifted in his cushioned
chair he turned his eyes nervously to
the venetian blinds through which fil
tered the afternoon sunshine

  to the devil with the boche he
said querulously twenty miles away
and dropping shells on us is that war
i ask you bah

  ah let the war alone chautard
think of your game

  pardon gravault

  chautard put out his hand and drew

-l s

it back with a jerk as the blinds rattled
and the chess men danced on the board

  sacre nom he cried steadying his
elbow on the chair did you hear that
one i swear it struck the church
gravault carefully replaced a bishop
dislodged from his square

  see monsieur the cure is safe
enough you are as nervous as a cat
look at me do i tremble or shake
am i afraid of death

  you are an apothecary said chau-
tard curtly death means nothing to
you

  ah i forgot you only come in after
death to read the will well it is not
my will you will read my friend
enough gravault

  chautard rose to his feet

  i have the honor to wish you good-
day he added in a furious tone

  oh sit down neighbor i meant no
offence sit down ill fetch a bottle
from the cellar

  much obliged but i have no wish to
be poisoned

  poisoned what has got into your
head ah i see-it is shell shock
the two old men glared at each other
gravault pulling his white beard nerv-
ously the notary screwing up his clean
shaven wizened brown face and drawing
in his lips over his nearly toothless
gums

  there was an imperative knocking at
the door and before gravault could call
out it was pushed open abruptly and a
sergeant stepped across the threshold he




three old men

 

halted in amazement looking from one
old man to the other

  what is the matter here werent
you told to get out by noon

  they stood silent

  hurry the sergeant shouted impa-
tiently what is the matter with you
are you deaf  get out of here at once
the boches have the range and you may
be blown to bits any minute you must
leave as you are not a second to lose
here is this your hat put it on old
fellow now let me see how fast you
can run and with a not unsympathetic
push he shoved the two old men out
through the door into the street

  where are we to go to asked the
notary weakly

 eh dont bother me go back-
anywhere back of here-to paris-but
move along

  a stream of motor lorries laden with
infantry rumbled past them as they stood
at one side of the street looking up and
down helplessly already the buildings
began to show their gaping wounds
smoke was rising from the church a
dog slunk by limping

  time we got along neighbor said
gravault

  chautard still stared at the little white
house with its green blinds next to the
town hall for a moment it seemed as
if he were impressing the picture of his
home upon his mind then with a feeble
gesture of resignation he nodded his
head and without a word walked towards
the granary which marked the farthest
boundary of the village gravault fol-
lowed him slowly

  suddenly chautard turned and put out
his hand and gravault grasping it firm-
ly knew that he had found again his old
friend

  that is better he cried regaining
his cheerfulness there is no one else
with whom i should rather start upon a
journey

  nor i beginning life again eh mon
vieuxf

  and without a sou

  chautard beamed with almost childish
delight

  no my friend he announced no
you are wrong as to that trust your
legal adviser i took care to put some
money in my pocketbook not much
perhaps but at least we shall not starve
you rogue cried gravault in great
good humor then perhaps we can
travel by train

  to where-

  to paris i have not seen my brother
for years an old bachelor oh quite
an important personage in his way an
ex-detective and with political influence
we shall be well looked after

  just as well we have no dependents
said chautard as they walked on

  nothing to worry about but our-
selves eh that may be called selfish
but in a time like this-well 

  true pity those poor devils with
two or three squalling brats

  a good thing the women went yester-
day in the carts

  they came opposite a little farmhouse
a ragged rent showed in the sloping
roof and the walls were bulging as
though a giant hand had pressed upon
them from above

  poor madame florin said gravault
as they paused to look at the ruin it
is a good thing she did not wait to see
this it would have broken her heart
her man at the front and she toiling in
the fields for two dieu what was
that

  a faint wailing came to their ears

  a catj said chautard

listen  that is no cat it is a child
impossible cried chautard impa-
tiently surely marie florin did not go
yesterday without her child a devoted
mother if ever there was one

  what if she did not go suggested
gravault

  nonsense all the women went
come along it will be dark before
long
robert w sneddon



  gravault hesitated

  very well

  they walked on all at once gra-
vault stopped

  tell me chautard what if i go back
and have a look it is just possible it
may be little victor

  you are crazy

  crazy or not comrade i shall go and
see wait here it will not take a min-
ute

  chautard shrugged his shoulders
you are obstinate as a mule go
then on your fools errand but dont
blame me if you find nothing but a cat
gravault hastened across the field he
could hear nothing more but as he came
up to the ruin the wail was repeated
he peered in through the window then
cautiously climbed in a moment later
he came out carrying a bundle in his
arms and hastened to rejoin chautard
who had seated himself on a pile of
stones

  well asked chautard

  look

  gravaults voice was trembling and
chautard turned his head sharply

  oh mon dieu he cried so you
were right but i could have sworn
marie florin would not have deserted
her child

  it is strange gravault replied
gravely there is no trace of her any-
where what can have happened
the child was lying there

  beside a bundle of clothes it is
plain she left him

these women what folly  grum-
bled chautard too bad but what
are you going to do with the youngster 
gravault was surprised at the ques-
tion

  eh we must take him with us he
answered very simply

  chautard sat down again on the pile
of stones and threw up his hands

  what has come over you gravault
we have enough to do to look after our-
setves-two old men

  i am not so old gravault hastened
to assure him the child is no weight
to carry feel him he held the baby
out

  bah ejaculated chautard regarding
the child curiously it is a little animal
my advice to you is- he paused then
added hastily is to leave him by the
roadside someone else will be sure to
pick him up

  who demanded gravault derisive-
ly a general eh  an american gen-
eral he still held out the child to
chautard

  the notary putting out his hands to
ward off the extended burden suddenly
felt his thumb grasped in the convulsive
grip of sturdy little fingers in vain he
tried to free himself

  pester he spluttered at last who
would have imagined such strength it
is a little man after all it would be a
pity to leave him only do not expect
me to handle him

  a regular little soldier chuckled
gravault proudly enough little one
that will do for your wrestling keep
away from lawyers if you would be
happy if you must pull at something
here is my beard now march

  the procession limped on its way the
miles grew longer gravaults feet be-
came uncertain and he lurched at the
knees

  here cried chautard roughly give
me the brat not a word you were
a fool to take him but the mischief is
done

  a kindly motor driver going their way
picked them up and dropped them at a
railroad station in the canteen presided
over by two girls they were fed on sand-
wiches and coffee

  have you a bottle for the little one 
asked one of the girls bending over the
counter we can give him one and
some milk a boy isnt it how often
do you feed him

  chautard who was still holding the
child awkwardly in his arms looked


three old men

helplessly at her smiling face then
nudged gravault who was nodding to
sleep with fatigue on the bench beside
him

  heh grandfather he cried and
gave his companion a sly look of warn-
ing madame asks how often you feed
the child

  gravault straightened to attention
eh what is that child ah
yes he sought in his memory for the
lore he dispensed in his store to inex-
perienced mothers every three hours
madame but it is long since he has had
anything to eat

  poor little mite your grandson
msieu 

  for a moment gravault hesitated
here was his opportunity to get rid of
the burden which he had taken upon him-
self he had but to say no and he knew
he could leave little victor in hands
which would treat him tenderly he had
done his part he looked over at the
upturned face with its black round eyes
watching him with a comprehending cu-
riosity and he felt suddenly ashamed

  yes yes-my grandson he mumbled
hastily a fine boy eh

  chautard emitted a low grunt of im-
patience but something in the defiant
poise of his old friends head held him
silent

  well here is the bottle and good
luck you are taking him to his
mother said the girl

  alas no madame we do not know
where she is perhaps she is dead
what a pity msieu you are going
to paris  do you know where to go for
aid you might try the seminary of
saint sulpice

 we are provided for madame
many thanks all the same said chau-
tard stiffly

  pardon i meant a kindness only
but for the baby let me give you this
card ask for madame brochard the
matron if you need a womans help
and now-i think i hear your train

good-by messieurs good-by baby
you will find milk at other canteens no
thanks a pleasure to do a work of
mercy we must all help

  in the compartment of the stuffy car-
riage were two soldiers on leave who
were smoking like furnaces as gra-
vault climbed in with his burden pro-
pelled from behind by chautard they
took their pipes from - their mouths and
gaped

  dame cried one in a rough voice
do you not see msieu that this is a
smoking compartment 

  eh  whew panted gravault
plumping down on the wooden seat
any objection to our company

  none messieurs said the other po-
litely only-he pointed with the stem
of his pipe-for a baby the atmosphere
is pretty thick

  thats right muttered gravault
aghast where are your brains chau-
tard steering me here

  you will remember that i warned
you the child would be in our way an-
swered chautard in a surly tone as he
drew out a cigarette

  perhaps we had better change sug-
gested the apothecary

  too late msieu we are moving and
time too one might think they had
called out all the young andactive loco-
motives and left nothing but the old
wrecks to pull the trains

  true for you comrade but we are
going now chuckled his companion
what about our smoke

  why not stick your head out of the
window eh

  i am sorry messieurs apologized
gravault i did not think when i climbed
in i will remove myself at the next
station

  nonsense old man said the first
soldier lights out pierre

  they knocked the ashes out of their
pipes and sat back with folded arms

  chautard puffed at his cigarette his
eyes upon the low ceiling
robert w sneddon



  the baby sucking at the bottle coughed
and a dribble of milk ran down his chin
gravault wiped it off and looked piteous-
ly at his old friend

  perhaps it will be better chautard
if you put out your cigarette he sug-
gested timorously

  chautard drew down his eyes from the
roof and flashed an angry look at him

  jdieu he snarled bitterly i have
lost everything would you deprive me
of my only consolation

  the soldier in the corner stirred un-
easily

  see here you he said in a peremp-
tory tone the order was lights out
are you going to obey or must i make
you old man 

  he thrust his heavily mustached face
toward the notary

  if you must smoke put your head out
of the window

  and catch cold very likely do
you know who i am young man

  i dont care answered the soldier
simply but i know what you are you
are the prince of selfish old rascals
chautard glared at him a moment
then with a gesture of fury tore the
cigarette in two and flung it out of the
window

  ah that is better said the soldier
with a grin now we can be friends all
round eh pardon my words msieu
but i have a baby at home and i know
when to smoke and when to do without
it then he added seriously we
must take care of the babies we others
they are the hope of france eh you
look tired old boy perhaps if i took
the baby for a little you might sleep
he stretched out his strong arms and
took little victor gravault sighed with
relief the monotonous jolting of the
tram was making him nod he could
see that chautard his head bent on his
breast had dropped off to sleep

  a moments rest then mon brave
if you will be so kind he said drowsily
and closed his eyes

  when he opened them again it was
broad daylight the train was still crawl-
ing along the poilu had victor on his
knee sitting upright

  bon dieu gravault cried in con-
sternation as he came to his senses i
have been asleep and the little one had to
be fed

  dont worry my comrade ran out
at a stop and got the bottle filled said
the temporary nurse he swallowed it
down like a little sucking pig it is a
brave little fellow and not a whimper
out of him and look msieu how he is
laughing now you will laugh yourself
another performance bag of tricks

  with a grin the other soldier tied a
knot in his handkerchief and put his fore-
finger in it then draping the cloth about
his hand there was a little puppet with a
pointed cap whose arms the thumb and
second finger gesticulated violently now
folding across his breast now calling
upon heaven for vengeance on the boche
now extended as if in benediction

  the little preacher msieu the con-
triver confessed shyly

  it is amazing said gravault i
must remember this let me see ah
it is very simple after all

  he glanced over at chautard who ap-
parently was still asleep through the
window he could see the gaily painted
villas growing closer and closer to each
other the thickening of traffic on the
roads

  is it paris already then he asked

  the nurse sprang to his feet and
thrust his head out of the window

  paris yes now were happy eh
boy look out youngster what an
experience for vou paris youre still
there old eiffel-

  i went up the tower -in the year of the
exposition said a dry voice the view
was superb and what mushrooms for
lunch

  ah you are awake old boy cried
the soldier heartily now you will get
your smoke no offense i hope msieu


three old men

  chautard screwed up his face then
mumbled

  none i was tired last night par-
don  he turned to gravault to ask with
a sort of timidity and the little one
old friend

  a regular traveler msieu cried the
nurse

  the baby crowed confidingly

  hear that he knows what paris is
eh well we must get our belongings
together there mon petit you can go
back to grandpa

  gravault formulated a denial of re-
lationship again but it did not come and
reaching out his arms he took victor

  thanks mon gars he said cordially
when i go back home if-if- he
faltered

  no ifs it is an understood thing
go back we shall put you back we
boys certainly

  then you must come and see me
and we shall open a bottle together and
smoke a pipe eh here is my card
surely with pleasure

  the train drew to a halt with a suc-
cession of back-breaking jolts

  gare du nord at last i swear these
engine drivers drove cabs before the war
what a jolting come along comrade
an revoir messieurs au revoir vic-
tor

  they shook hands all round kissed
victor and swinging down from the car-
riage threw out their chests and stag-
gered down the platform

  the two old men climbed down and
stood dumbly for a moment bewildered
by the confusion then chautard took
the lead 

  come with me i know my way
when i was here in the year of the ex-
position i took a cab we must find a
cab and then a hotel

no hotels said gravault decisively
they cost money we will go and see
my brother in the rue des sts pbres
as you please answered chautard
stiffly perhaps after all you are right

with a child it would be difficult to get
into a hotel i told you but you would
not listen now we must both suffer
for your obstinacy however i shall
say no more only when we come to
the gates and the examination of pas-
sengers let me do the talking they
may suspect us of kidnapping or worse
and a fine pair of country fools we should
look then come along

  there said chautard with a com-
placent air as they came safely out of the
station what did i tell you we did
that very neatly i flatter myself
thanks to your lawyers tongue but
what did you say when you bent over
and whispered to the officer

  eh chautard was confused eh
in a case of this sort gravault it is well
to mak sure so-

  so gravaults tone was full of
suspicion

  so chautard confessed so i said
i was his grandfather too

  look here chautard grumbled
gravault two grandfathers are you
crazy 

  two grandfathers the maternal
and the paternal there is nothing un-
natural in that do i want to grand-
father the brat no it was solely for
your sake but hurry let us get to your
brother and get settled i am anxious
to see some of the sights i saw in the
year of the-

  yes yes-the exposition hi cabby
sapristi it is a woman

  yes msieu jump in where to
rue des sts pkres bon get up
cocotte

  the venerable horse ambled on its
way the two old passengers gazing with
gaping eyes at the wonderful sights the
uniforms the cafes as gay as ever the
hurrying crowds even more interested
was victor sitting erect on gravaults
knee sucking his thumb

  at the door of the antique store in
the narrow street monsieur gravault
the younger smoking his pipe serenely
robert w sneddon

with his dog musette at his feet was
amazed to seethe party which drew up

  where in the devil did you come
from he cried as he ran to embrace
his brother why did you not send me
word this is monsieur chautard isnt
it and    his jaw fell and he
puckered up his lips whew who
is this you are married you old ras-
cal and a child at your age  eh bien
i always said the gravaults came of good
stock but where is madame

  no you are making a mistake pro-
tested the apothecary this is a little
refugee victor florin the son of one of
the villagers his mother poor woman
could not be found

  and his father

  the antique dealer peered with his
short sighted eyes as if expecting to see
another man descend from the vehicle

  at the front we are looking after
the child but can you put us up for a
little we have no homes now you
know

  gravault the younger hesitated

  you are welcomeboth of you that
goes without saying but a child- well
i am an old bachelor it will be difficult
and besides i do not know how musette
will behave to a child if she were to
bite him that would be a pretty mess
he looked from one to the other as if
asking their sympathy in his dilemma
then his attention was attracted to victor
who stared at him with unblinking black
eyes that seemed to search into the re-
cesses of the perturbed soul of the
bachelor

  oh well he continued hastily
come inside it is safer and i have a
fine cellar in case of alarm does the
child walk no good i have some
valuable antiques i do not want broken
this way brother come monsieur
chautard make yourself at home we
parisians should be proud to do anything
for you who are exiles

the question which alone had come
between monsieur gravault the younger

and the extension of all the hospitality
and kindness which at heart he was de-
lighted to dispense was settled by the
two parties concerned for while the three
men were disposing of an omelette war
bread and a bottle of wine victor had
been set down on a rug on the floor
musette after a cursory sniff at the in-
truder had retired to a safe distance
and head on paws watched him through
half closed eyelids suddenly victor
attracted by the fall of a crumb from
the table began to crawl toward it a
low growl came from musette she shot
to her feet and came forward silent and
menacing victor reached out for the
crumb and at that moment musette snap-
ped her jaws together with just enough
of threat to have stayed an older person
but the imperturbable crawler sat up
and with a pudgy fist struck the dog on
the nose and added further insult by
catching him by a long ear and pulling
hard musettes back stiffened then
crouching she stretched out her neck
her long tongue shot forth she moaned
faintly and submissively

  there  cried the apothecary what
do you say to that my brother  look
this ferocious hound of yours is licking
the little ones face

  then it is settled sighed the antique
dealer with relief after all i have
always maintained musette was a dog of
sense you can stay here as long as you
please and i shall be glad to have you
it is lonely here now since my old friend
bidoche became a landed proprietor and
moved to the country we can have a
game of cards in the evenings in the cel-
lar and as for the little one there is a
poor woman who has just lost her baby
and she will be glad to come in and look
after-what is his name -ah victor a
good name it is near to victory and we
shall have that next year thanks to our
brave lads and the allies

 so the bargain was made weeks
went by peacefully in spite of the ever-
present menace of war


three old men

  by the by said chautard one night
after the game of cards i have been
thinking i have no one in the world to
follow me and i can not take my money
along with me suppose i set aside a
sum for victor eh

  you are a good fellow chautard
cried gravault heartily i have always
said so have i not brother

  nonsense cried the notary but his
thin face flushed with pleasure i shall
make him my heir as well him as an-
other only do not ask me to look after
the little animal that is all and now i
shall go to bed if you will allow me
good night my friends

  after he was gone the two brothers
sat smoking in silence when gravault
the elder rose to go to bed his brother
spoke as if the idea had just come to
him

  say all the same it is very curious
he said reflectively little animal or
not it is victor this and victor that all
the time one would think the old boy
really was his grandfather madame
destries tells me she comes upon him
daily amusing the youngster with some
sort of a game with a handkerchief
what can that be

  gravault the elder scratched his ear
a handkerchief let me see now
why that must be the little preacher a
good poilu showed me- i thought
chautard was asleep the rascal i had
forgotten about it say what you like
there is a heart within that dried hide
of his only have you noticed these
last two days he is not himself he has
almost the look of a man with a secret
he starts at a word he watches the
door what can be the matter
poof said the antique dealer as he
took up his candle he is old and the
cough of big bertha is bad for the
nerves nothing more pleasant dreams
brother and no boche planes

  the next night chautard laid down
his cards on the table in the middle of
the game

  it is no use i cannot sleep what
have i done poor victor i am a
monster

  his partners protested

  come come you are talking non-
sense

  who could be kinder to victor 

  but chautard continued in a dull tone
yes i am to be condemned and you
would condemn me most of all my
friends listen three days ago i was
crossing the pont neuf when a soldier
passed in front of me there was noth-
ing extraordinary in that but no sooner
was he past than he turned with a quick
look at me as if memory had returned to
him i recognized him it was victor
florin

  the father of little victor cried the
antique dealer dame that was a
meeting but where is he why did
you not bring him home with you
chautard bent his head his lean
hands smoothed down the cloth on the
table till it seemed as if he would rub
the skin from his finger tips

  that is it i did not we spoke for
a little he was on leave for a week
he had just reached paris that day he
was in a daze he could do nothing
but stare at me with fierce eyes and
then-he moistened his lips-then
when i was about to tell him of the little
one something stopped me

  and you let him go without a word 
asked the antique dealer in open-mouthed
surprise

  yes answered chautard simply he
did not look up he gave me his ad-
dress and we parted

  but why- demanded gravault the
younger with increased bewilderment

  permit me as your elder brother
the apothecary begged ceremoniously
there is something strange about this
i dont understand why did you not
say to florin my poor fellow all is
not lost come with me and see your
son nothing more was necessary
dieu the emotion of the meeting
robert w sneddon



should not have robbed you of words
you a notary experienced in matters of
this kind

  but chautard did not appear to hear
he seemed to be listening for some ex-
pected sound

  can it be possible suggested the
antique dealer in a modest whisper to
his brother that he is afraid victor will
be taken from him

  chautard looked up fiercely

  the child is ours mon dieu why
should we give him back to misery 
not to misery my friend said the
apothecary gently not to misery but to
his father

  his father you are talking senti-
ment now in the trenches what time
has his father to think of anything but
the filth the rats the noise the hazard
of death the assault he has no time
for paternity tell me what has a sol-
dier to do with a child

  you are wrong chautard said the
apothecary in a voice which he could not
keep from trembling you are wrong
without the children we should have
no soldiers for what does a soldier
fight for his country an acre of land
a house a city no he fights for the
family for the many families which
make up a nation if he has no family
of his own he fights for the family of
his neighbor for the wife who has no
man for the girl who has no brother
for the child who has no father he
fights that they too may live and breathe
the air of the good god in liberty in
equality in fellowship that each may
have his or her rightful chance he
fights with all his courage-for an ideal
perhaps you will say but a father-a
father fights with his love behind him
he defends the doorway of his home he
stands across the cradle listen old
friend we others who are like you with-
out children we understand perhaps
we too might have done as you but
now-where is that address let us
send madame destries to bring this

father here if she can-and then we
can talk things over

  without a word chautard fumbled in
his pocket and brought out the scrap of
paper on which he had noted down the
address it was in the rue de grenelle
close by madame destries was des-
patched with orders to say nothing be-
yond the invitation to come and in si-
lence they waited once chautard tried
to speak but gravault laid his hand on
his shoulder almost in a caress

  wait he counseled wait when
the time comes our hearts will speak the
right word

  victor florin came back with madame
destries his honest face flushed with his
haste

  ah monsieur gravault this is a
pleasure he cried pleased to make
your acquaintance msieu good eve-
ning monsieur chautard lucky you
caught me i was just about to go to
the hospital what is it you want of
me you have heard my news eh
you have heard something from the vil-
lage

  the excitement died from his eyes as
gravault the elder shook his head

  we have heard nothing from the vil-
lage but-but there is someone-he
sought for words udame he contin-
ued roughly there is someone you
knowhere to see you go with madame
destries and he thrust him out of the
room

  madame destries came back almost at
once she was between laughing and
crying

  never have i seen anything like it
no not even in the cinema it was
beautiful messieurs what a man at
first he could not believe-and the little
one sleeping like an angel-and then
when he picked him up to his breast-i
thought of my little henri and i could
not say    she looked at them plead-
ingly he will not take little victor
away surely

  the door burst open a new florin


any depot platform in dry state

entered joyously little victor nestling
securely in the crook of his left arm

  ah thank you messieurs  thank
you i am gfateful but what a sur-
prise permit me to shake your hands
and so healthy and my faith i believe
he knows me see how he holds to my
buttons what can i ever do to repay
you and madame who tells me she has
had care of him if you knew what this
means  i have a son again only-his
face clouded-my permission expires in
three days and then poor little one what
is to become of him unless perhaps mes-
sieurs the doctors at the hospital are
right   

  the doctors asked gravault won-
deringly there is nothing wrong with
the child surely did you not say he
was healthy 

  but marie msieu i am speaking
of marie my wife

  he studied their astonished faces
eagerly

  is it possible have you not heard
i have found marie in a hospital mes-
sieurs a miracle yes it seems that
she went to fetch a basket from the barn
and a splinter struck her while she
was insensible an ambulance picked her
up and brought her to paris they did
not know of little victor until she began
to cry aloud to plead for him mes-
sieurs she is insane they say byt to-
day the doctor said my lad if you can
find your child there is one hope that

the touch of him on her breast may bring
her back to her senses and to-day i
have been in despair-where to look
where to seek news but now if you
will permit me-i shall take victor with
me yes a thousand thanks and after
-but it is nine oclock i must hurry
an revoir

  the door closed upon his excited exit
good night messieurs said madame
destries dully if i may i shall slip
round to the church

  there was a long pause after she left
them

  after all said chautard in a low
voice that does not prevent me doing
what i said to-morrow i shall go to
the hospital meanwhile will you play
a game of chess with me gravault
willingly that occupies the mind
all very well but what am i to do 
grumbled the antique dealer dolefully

  oh you- said his brother as he
opened the board occupy yourself with
musette

  bah f musettes master grunted and
settled himself in a deep chair his eyes
closed when they opened again he saw
a strange sight the game of chess was
at an end his brother a newspaper in
front of him was peering over the top of
it at chautard and chautard a hand-
kerchief draped over his hand was re-
hearsing some new variations in the emo-
tional gestures of the little preacher in
preparation for the next days visit

 t shall get you a servant to-day
 i if it-if she costs one hundred
dollars a month jones told his
wife his young wife in the fiercest of
accents and with the most benevolent
of looks having delivered himself of
his intentions as a good husband should
he kissed his wife on her lips on her
young lips and strode out of the house
with all the dignity it is possible for a
man to assume when he carries an um-
brella under his right arm and is in a
hurry to catch the eight-twenty-five

  at five oclock that evening he tri-
umphantly returned with alice who had
asked only fifty dollars a month

  alice was small-petite is the word
i think-and she had fine exquisitely
curved lips-red lips they were and
she had other accomplishments among
them two blue eyes the exact color of the
lamp shade in the jones parlor and a
very blue lamp shade it was also she
had fair skin and white hands and as
you can see at once she looked much
more like a maid in a sardou play like
the one that is dusting the furniture
when the curtain goes up than like an
honest - to - inefficient - maid - presum-
ably-of-all-work receiving the insidious
sum of fifty dollars a month for her
services as mrs bellers mrs bellers
was the mother of mrs jones not the
mother of mr jones said a few years
ago she would have been glad to come
for sixteen a month very likely she
would have been

  when alice was alone at last in her
room on the top-floor her first sensation
was one of chilliness she was cold

and curiously enough she was lonely
although there was a whole houseful of
people below her nevertheless she sat
disconsolately on the edge of her bed
and looked about her the size of the
apartment did not permit any far gaz-
ing any more than the earth permits
man to look far when like alice he is
young and curious and hot and cold at
once she felt like some one just born
thrust onto a circumscribed earth from
remote and freer worlds her mental
orbit she felt must henceforth swing
within these four bare walls and no
further every moment that she sat
on the edge of the bed the walls grew
nearer to each other or seemed to do so

  this was all a great pity for alice
had once loved the fairies and believed in
them and while she was wiser now
that her childhood lay behind her she
had always a haunting doubt telling
her that there really are fairies on earth
or at least one fairy a good fairy but
what fairy good bad or indifferent ever
came up to the top floor

  alice was so cold by this time that
she slipped over to the radiator and sat
down on the floor and leaned against
the one warm and therefore friendly
thing in the room after a while she
ceased sobbing-at least she ceased when
she fell asleep

  this morning said mrs jones sotto
voce to mr jones at dinner she ruined
the eggs at lunch she burned the liver
and look at the chicken

  her worse half dutifully looked and
saw at once that harm had been done
to that bird it did not look healthy




alice-sit-by-the-radiator

it did not possess the robust appearance
which it had when mrs jones bought it
indeed it was shriveled and mean-look-
ing and wan and tough appearing all
at once as far as the chicken was con-
cerned nothing would ever be the same

  it cant be eaten its burned beyond
recognition jones said in a dreadful
voice and it was no rooster would
ever claim it now as his own fair own

  what shall we do said mrs jones
shes such a nice girl and so pretty 

  she must have learned to cook from
a cook-book jones said but added
she is a nice girl

  everybody admitted alice was a nice
girl even mrs bellers mr jones
could never decide whether she thought
herself ediths mother or his mother
admitted alice was a nice girl and a
pretty girl but above all nice

  i am paying her fifty dollars a
month said jones speaking in a tone
of voice which left no doubt that he
was thinking in long words and not in
short numerals

  they are so hard to get said mrs
jones

  her husband sighed they are hard
to get

  now alice knew perfectly well-as
well as the joneses you and myself-
that she had maltreated that chicken so
as soon as she placed it on the table
before the young couple she fled upstairs
to her room and waited for the fateful
summons she was sure was coming she
fled to the shelter and friendship of her
one good friend in the house-the ra-
diator and sat down next to him she
was sure it was a him with palpitating
heart and quick breath but no word
came from downstairs instead after
a while she heard a door slam the
joneses had gone to a nearby restaurant
for supper perhaps they had not called
alice down because their hearts were
heavy within them the chicken was not
however as alice saw when she crept
downstairs and into the dining-room

  im hungry said alice wistfully
but i cant eat that alice was not
altogether impractical

  by and by she went back to her ra- 
diator and considered her future

  i cant sew she thought and i
cant learn shorthand and i cant cook
she closed her eyes and smiled in
fact i cant do anything she said aloud j
im useless which was ridiculous as
anybody could see by looking at her

  i cant go back home alice con- t
tinued aloud if i keep on cooking i
shall inevitably commit manslaughter
mr and mrs jones heaved a sigh in
the restaurant and agreed with her

  i shall have to get married said
alice-sit-by-the-radiator

  opportunity rang the doorbell once
right there and then

  is neither of them at home said
opportunity who turned out to be an
eligible looking young man in a great-
coat and small hat alice reaffirmed the
absence of her lord and lady the joneses
of suburbia

  but they invited me to dinner said
opportunity pleasant but somewhat puz-
zled

  they must have forgotten said
alice you see i burned the chicken

 and do you always burn the
chicken asked the young man face-
tiously

  always said alice and burst into
tears

  it is a commonplace for opportunity
to knock at the door -but it is a rare
thing for opportunity to eat a burnt
chicken yet that is precisely what op-
portunity proceeded to do after alice
suddenly let loose her emotions in
vain for her to protest -

  i was invited here to supper he
said firmly releasing her from his arms
and here on the table is a chicken
burnt  what of it  do you know that
one of our revolutionary heroes lived on
burnt sweet potatoes well he did
why he would have considered burnt


edwin justus mayer



chicken a delicacy and very likely it
is

  alice waited on him and laughed at
him and with him and a very good time
was had by all including the radiator
which could be heard ticking ticking
ticking from above which is the way
radiators chuckle when they are happy

  as usual it was cold in the room and
alice sat down on that clean warm spot
on the floor which was heated by the
nearness of her good gray friend now
as has been said everybody admitted
that alice was a nice girl and with her
lovely body sloping against the pleas-
antly warm radiator she would dream
the sort of dreams nice girls dream
which of course are nice dreams
things would take on a rosy color harsh
things would soften and undulate and
renew themselves with kindness and
charmed images would rise in her eyes
in her silent communion with the fire-
light as it was to her of the radiator
sometimes alice would break the silence
and speak to the fire-light which was
what she was doing now

  i burst into tears she said remi-
niscently and he looked at me as if
he didnt know whether to pet me or
leave me or make love to me evidently
he has all sorts of decent instincts any-
way he started to leave me then he
started to pet me then he started to
kiss me

  i think i liked that best said alice
very seriously he really is good-look-
ing you know she told the radiator

  after a while i recovered myself and
he stopped kissing me her face
clouded for a moment and then lighted
up

  but he ate the burnt chicken she
said trimphantly

  she doesnt look in the least like a
servant no wonder she cant cook said
mrs bellers not taking the time to
puncture her sentence im sure she
added firmly theres a mystery about
her mrs bellers was eternally sus-

picious of the true status of other people

  theres nothing mysterious about her
 cooking said mr jones its rotten
 thats just what he said

  maybe shes an heiress run away from
 home said mrs bellers hopefully

maybe she cooked a meal and they
drove her out said mr jones darkly

  shes a nice girl said teddy camp-
 bell nephew to mrs bellers cousin to
 mrs jones opportunity to alice he
 had come in with his aunt

  what do you know about her de-
manded mrs bellers suspiciously

  i ate supper with her the other night
 teddy told her my fair cousin here
 invited me to dinner and when i ar-
 rived she was out with her husband
 there was a chicken on the table and
 i ate it

  you ate that burnt chicken asked
 jones

  it wasnt burnt it was just browned
 a little too much said teddy with a
 far-away look browned he added
 abstractedly

  burnt said mr jones fiercely
burnt sir

  alice heard the door slam once again
 and crept downstairs she walked into
 the parlor and came -face to face with
 opportunity

  i thought you went out with them
 she said

i dont like the movies said teddy

  neither do i said alice-sit-by-the-
 radiator

  who are you anyway said oppor-
tunity

  im alice said alice

  im teddy said opportunity
nephew to mrs bellers who thinks
you are a run-away heiress i am al-
ways kind to run-away heiresses when
i locate them

  are you said alice you were
kind to me the other evening

  was i kind to one then demanded
teddy

almost murmured the girl  i ran


someday

away from home because my aunt wanted
me to marry a wealthy undertaker
what an ideal said teddy im
in the advertising business myself
yesterday i went up and talked to
the radiator about alice

  i miss her very much he told me
with a sigh she was such a nice girl
she used to tell me all sorts of interest-
ing things about herself  about her school
days and her college days and her
wealthy and stingy aunt who wanted
her to marry some man she didnt want
to marry and how she ran away and
became a stenographer and lost her job
when she confused the words lost and
found in a letter then she went to
work in a factory but lost out there
too

  she was a nice girl said the ra-
diator but not very practical

  that was one of her charms he
added as an afterthought

  she married a cousin of the joneses
he went on after a while it was quite
a shock to them as nobody in the family
had ever before married a servant girl
i never heard of such a thing i heard
mrs bellers say when he told them about
it but he married her

  are they reconciled-the joneses the

bellers and the bridal couple i asked

  quite said the radiator her aunt
was so glad to hear that she was safely
married that she forgave her everything
at least thats what i heard but these
days the house isnt what it was you
know we have no cook cant get one
its awful

  so everybody is happy i said
everybody but mrs jones said the
radiator when she heard that teddy
was going to marry alice-she used to
sit just where you are standing-she
said and just as she was getting
trained i dont think she is over it
even now cooks are hard to get these
days you know

  at that moment there was a swish in
the hallway and in came alice sparkling
furred gay she did not see me simply
because i have the fascinating power of
making myself invisible when i want to
do so

  she slipped over to the old radiator
and sat down on the floor and felt it
with her hands

  dear old thing she said dear old
thing said alice-sit-by-the-radiator and
there was a confused sputter heard the
sort that radiators make when they are
half crying and half laughing

tltour job will be waiting when

words old man carew said to
johnny lamb as they shook hands be-
fore the boy went to camp

  once in a moment of wild excitement
mr holling laid aside his manner of
being in perpetual attendance at a pe-
culiarly solemn memorial service and
barked at hatty

 say young lady whatn h- er

blazes are you supposed to be round
here anyway

  hatty had so far been jostled out of
her usual cheeky self-possession as to
stand in open-mouthed amazement be-
fore the startling tableau of the man
of dignity in a towering rage but she
had speedily recovered her unquench-
able self smirked at him and answered
with a triple wriggle of her chewing
gum

  just hatty

  in a way that was exactly it-that
is to say during the first months in
which hatty honored the otherwise nor-
mal firm of morningfield carew  mc-
cullough with her presence having
been just hatty at that time explains
perhaps her presence with the firm in
the yer of peace 

hatty was a war relic regarded dis-
passionately one might say that she was

one of those recurrent minor atrocities
of a war supposedly ended she would
have remained a simple lily of harlem
if it had not been for the war and with
no serious intent would she have ap-
proached nearer to the swift running cur-
rent of nassau street than one hundred
and forty-sixth street the war made
her although to be just she really dis-
covered the war by herself and in no
sense could she have been called a war

that fatal winter - when a rapa-

round for the last available crop of ste-
nographers there were whole days
when the click of a typewriter in the
abandoned region of wall street sounded
as lonely as a nightingale in yonkers
then when all the good stenographers
and passable typists had surged toward

peded the hitherto peaceful domestic
offices daily they came the silk stock-

madge or alice brady hatty would
have made the jaguars run to cover in
the jungle and old man carew in a
day and a night would have made a
jungle out of palm beach so there
you are

  old man carew second on the sign
of morningfield carew  mccullough
burlap and denim sack manufacturers
but first in importance and general peev-
ishness followed miss judson the last
of the stenographers into the corridor
and to the elevator his shoulders were
round as a bundle of hall runner his
eyes sunk like golf balls in mud and
his spirit diminished to the size of the
 sugar allotment now miss jud-
son was a good shift lock manipulator
and a mistress of the hieroglyphics of
shorthand furthermore by compari-
son to other stenographers the firm had
recently acquired she shone like varnish
against a first coat

  im sorry mr carew said miss
judson drawing one hand back through
the palm of her glove like the retreating
head of a snail and then pressing her
fingers forward and stroking the leather
she cast her eyes north and continued

  i am going to washington these
are critical times mr carew the gov-
ernment needs me

  cut the editorial guff and revert to
personals interrupted old man carew
rudely just how much are you going
to hold me up for

  mr carew responded miss judson
with dignity i am going to washing-
ton to do my bit
ferdinand reyher



  he grew hysterical at that
you wont take- he shouted and
his words congealed as his eye caught
the indicatoi on the elevator clock whiz-
zing counter-wise  -  -  - 
there was a burst of sinister crimson
in the bulb beneath the clock a clat-
ter of iron old man carew unhypno-
tized himself

til make it- he began desperately
good-by mr carew lilted miss
judson flicking a gloved hand at him

  she turned in the elevator and smiled
as the folding grill with a chuckling clat-
ter unlimbered its lattice between them
the indicator resumed its counter step-
ping -----    -
- as it settled on  he tore himself
away and flung through the door into the
outer office of morningfield carew 
mccullough he jabbed a shaking fin-
ger at johnny lamb and a trembling fist
in the austere direction of mr holling

  if any of you ever let another female
come into this office who knows the dif-
ference between a letter of acknowledg-
ment and a legal holiday ill--til-he
wheezed off into incoherency after a
bit he got the brakes on to himself and
once more became noisily intelligible
the next one that comes stays forever
i dont care if she knows so much that
she can carry it in her locket and still
have room for a powder puff by ten
thousand cripes now the man who puts
an idea into her head or even teaches
her how to sharp a pencil will-will-
brrrrr  he blew up again with a noise
like the stripping of gears

  he was still rumbling and erupting
with molten hate an hour later miss
mencken who came to take a letter from
him in place of miss judson suddenly
shot out of his private office as from
the barrel of a howitzer wild-eyed and
in tears an eerie wail in the accents
of old man carew pursued her couched
in notes of a blood-curdling pathos
oh oh oh t wana commit aspasia
or something im goin to mexico-

-l s

theyll all kill me yet get out get
out eskimoes eskimoes thats
what they are-punctuation spelling
ten thousand cripes now dont nobody
go to school no more  throw out the
typewriters-throw em all out-throw
em outta the window-use em for road
foundations denham denham come
here denham

  imperturbable charley denham cool
and smiling breezed into old man
carews den of profanity

 denham make a note o this
shrieked the old man be here at five
oclock t-morrer morning and interview
all the office charwomen and slect three
for secretarial jobs three of em
make a note o that denham

  denham laughed and went out leaving
the old man fluttering down through
fantastic circles of humor to a normal
temperature a little later carew sent
out a note to johnny lamb

  insert following advertisement in all
morning papers read the note and then
the advertisement

 wanted four husky female la-
borers for light office work

  about two-thirty he popped out and
shouted across to mr holling as though
they had been carrying on an uninter-
rupted conversation

  youll get me one that even washing-
ton won take and while that sounds
crazy youll do it-do you hear-youll
do it 

  the door of his office slammed behind-
him from outside in the corridor came
the metallic clattering of an elevator gate
sliding open and shut as though it were
the echo of the banging of old man
carewa door a moment later the of-
fice door opened and hatty came in

  she was about nineteen slim with that
wriggle to her walk which suggests
coney island on an august sunday
longacre square at eleven-fifteen satur-
day night sixth avenue and thirty
fourth street on the eve of holidays
and every other spot overpacked with
 your job will be waiting when you get back

congregating humanity she was that
exclusive product of new york and the
subway that personifies the rush hour
motto of harlem and the bronx-
room for just one more  she had the
air of being able to board an express at
grand central at the zero hour five-fifty-
eight and arrive at her station on the
outskirts with her hat on straight and not
a crease in her blouse

  the first lasting impression she gave
after the surface impression of baby
prettiness had been dispelled was a sense
of self-dependence and nerve a tinge
of green in her eyes did this and a
certain hauteur with which she wore her
clothes the whole outfit of which could
not have cost her family more than sixty
dollars as though she were trailing
through a world safe for all democrats
in the habiliments of the queen of
sheba

  she paused on the threshold of the of-
fice daintily punishing the chewing gum
in her mouth and cooly returning the
stare of the gaping force then her eyes
lighted on johnny lamb

  lamb was the office cub and one of its
principal rays of sunshine he had a
head of curly hair and a disposition like
the sublimated essence of the cheeriest
beams of old sol he was rather shy at
heart but an incurable romanticism con-
stantly drove him out of himself he
was the kind who make all the fifty-to-
one wagers and draw to the inside
straights of the world being a devotee of
enthusiasms and the prospect of getting
taft for president of the yanks or char-
ley hughes to manage the dodgers
would furnish him with serious conver-
sation for weeks at a stretch

  dye need any stenographers  hatty
asked him

  regarding her with wide twinkling
eyes he rose smiling

  funny that is he laughed i just
heard something about something like
that

  im ready to start now said hatty

  say aint that fine he exclaimed
heartily and paused but dyou know
he added with confidential frankness
im afraid im not exactly the chap to
ask

  gee aint that strange i thought
now you must be the president sure she
said innocently but use all your pull
and see if you cant get me a interview
say all the pull i got round here
wouldnt stretch a rubber band but mr
holling over there hes the director of
employment and-follow me

  he led her to mr holling who was
entrenched like a feudal despot behind
a huge double rosewood desk which
stood by itself

  this young lady is an expert stenog-
rapher began chubby lamb romanti-
cally bowing slightly toward hatty and
she wants a job

  mr holling frowned upon hatty her
nose crinkled faintly as she stared back
at him mr holling had a manner that
fairly vibrated with the desire to use
whatever advantage he could gather to
himself over anyone unfortunate enough
to be compelled to confront him in the
role of petitioner he was the incarna-
tion of disapproval

 where have you worked before
asked mr holling

  in a telephone exchange answered
hatty i was an operator

  in a-a what demanded mr hol-
ling a telephone operator and you
ask for a stenographers position  have
you ever gone to a business college or
had any experience in shorthand or type-
writing

  why mister exclaimed hatty in a
grieved tone them business schoolsve
each got a waiting line in front of em
from here to van cortlandt park i
was thinking i could learn right here
does this look like a school room to
you what ever brought you here
miss dye think weve got the time to
instruct you demanded mr holling
in sheer horror
ferdinand reyher



  his idea of running a business in a
crisis was to look up the word crisis in
the dictinoary and then turning to the
book of customary procedure do what
had always been done before in precisely
the same way old man carew thought
mr holling had been speaking ironical-
ly about engaging an inexperienced ste-
nographerhe could not have been seri-
ous of course not hunting and being
given employment was a sacred proposi-
tion in mr hollings eyes it was some-
thing of mercantile ceremonial a sort
of commercial confirmation one came
humbly with a starched air if not in a
starched dress bearing typewritten and
properly endorsed catechisms of recom-
mendations and references no emer-
gency nonsense about mr holling in
his souls horrified recoil from the spec-
tacle of hatty asking for a stenogra-
phers job on the basis of having been a
telephone operator he was hardly con-
scious of what she said to him

  gee mr hollow i learned to oprate
a switchboard in four days and thats
some complicated job ill tell the world
you put me on and ill guarantee-
do you mean to say you have had no
stenographic experience asked mr
denham who had come up and over-
heard

  gee come to think oft oncet i-
meditated hatty slowly but mr denham
gripped her arm firmly and checked her

  not another word please he said
almost harshly before she could dig up
from her past any incriminating evidence
youre engaged whats your name
hatty beamed up at him with delight
here was a man who appreciated great
talents in the rough

  harriet weller she said

  here write it down with your ad-
dress and telephone

  hatty scrawled it

  do you see that desk over there
from now on thats to be your business
residence come along please miss
weller

  he gently touched her elbow and har-
riet advanced toward her future business
residence behind them mr holling
was emitting gurgling noises expressive
of supreme spiritual agony it was al-
ways a bitter reflection upon himself felt
mr holling that charles denham with
his sense of humor should be his imme-
diate superior this latest grotesquery
of the humorous denham taking old
man carew literally at his word and en-
gaging a stenographer whom certainly
even washington would never take from
them was really too much

  mr lamb this is miss weller one
of our new stenographers mr denham
was announcing soberly on the other side
of the room to johnny lamb youll
be kind enough to give her what assist-
ance she may need at first in becoming
accustomed to the work

  so having palmed off hatty on sunny
johnny lamb mr denham hastily de-
parted from the room with all his sol-
emnity intact-until the door shut behind
him johnny stood there with a great
grin playing like may sunshine over his
face it was patent that he did not share
mr hollings attitude toward the ad-
visability of attaching hatty to the firm
of morningfield carew  mccullough
he lifted the edge of the desk which was
to be hattys the central section made
a combination leap and dive and there
stood hattys typewriter

  ooh said hatty its like a jack-
in-the-box aint it

  thats your typewriter laughed
johnny

  gee vsaid hatty looking at the type-
writer and transferring the wintergreen
from the left to the right molars that
dont look so awful hard to work does it 
is it anything like a pieaner

  johnny threw back his head and
laughed and a ripple of sprightly titter-
ing ran around the room as they stood
there they looked like the joy twins a
sudden lightness had come into the place
the whole office with the exception of
 your job will be waiting when you get back

mr holling took hatty affectionately to
itself it remains to be said that mr
denham having engaged hatty in what
was certainly a facetious moment did
play fairly with her-as fairly as a super-
stitious man who in a crisis plays the
limit on a hunch she seemed to bring
luck for in the next three days the firm
engaged seven girls who could take dicta-
tion if it were given to them as elemen-
tarily and distinctly as a starter in a race
says get ready set go and
would even put in a punctuation mark
where it belonged if a pistol were fired
mr denham never waved the high sign
of dismissal at hatty although as a ste-
nographer she was as useful to the firm
as the elevator starter on the ground floor
gradually she drifted into the role of a
kind of sublimated office girl criss-cross-
ing the rooms on small errands which
eventually gave her a certain librarians
knowledge of the company for which
every one found constant and increasing
use with it all she remained forever
just hatty darting to and fro like a
dragon fly glimmering with slangy laugh-
ter chewing gum giving a rapier retort
to every pin prick of witticism addressed
to her it was always hatty get me
that spurgis report i think its file 
or  hatty wheres that ashbrot
taffel  drey fuss pittsburgh memoran-
dum mr denham was asking for 
hatty wheres this  and hatty
wheres that yet she never seemed to
be doing anything seemingly surfeited
with time enough to try fantastic finger-
ing systems on typewriters left unguarded
for a moment time to relieve tessie
edelsohn at the switchboard for a quar-
ter of an hour time to-seemingly there
was nothing for which she could not find
time the keen edge of even mr holl-
ings resentment at the presence of any-
thing so capricious as hatty in a sober
office blunted into grim acceptance his
last outburst against her occurred on the
afternoon when he came upon hatty
showing victor one of the office boys

how to make practical drinking cups out
of bond paper legal size

  young lady isnt there anything you
can find to do here  besides destroying
office material and wasting the time of
these boys he fussed reaching round
hatty for the paper cup holder that at
this moment was paper cupless

  hatty calmly handed him the drinking
cup she had just taught victor to make

   ere yare mr oilin she clipped
triumphantly at him

  he glared at her for a moment and
then actually snatched the cup out of her
hand

  ill tell you whats wrong with you
mr oilin said the astonishing hatty
coolly folding another sheet of paper into
a drinking cup youre a reglar busi-
ness man awright awtight but youre
not a reglar guy

  with that she tossed victor the other
drinking cup and walked away leaving
mr holling so agitated that his fingers
clutched convulsively on the drinking cup
he held and pressed open its edges so
that a trickle of cool spring water de-
scended upon his immaculate waistcoat
and trousers

  fate had been kind to both the office
and hatty in keeping her away from her
principal source of danger-old man
carew in a moment of hysteric eccen-
tricity he had really been responsible for
her in a similar moment of outraged wil-
fulness he might have been equally re-
sponsible for her abrupt departure
some day of course a dramatic collision
between those two fantastic personalities
would take place and daily the office
awaited it and with every day fatuously
hoped it would be deferred came a day
when the old man was in one of his usual
bad moods and in the afternoon he sud-
denly stalked out of his private office and
glared about him it just happened that
not one of the stenographers was in the
room with the exception of hatty who
was picking out now is the time for the
good brown fox to jump over the lazy
ferdinand reyher



party on the fourteenth of last month
with one finger and a puckered expres-
sion of intense concentration upon miss
rosemans typewriter

  he pointed at hatty and shouted
you miss bring your book and
come here

  that which every stenographer in the
office dreaded more than influenza had
descended upon hatty of all people
augustus bains old man carews secre-
tary was away at something or other and
the old man had singled out a victim from
the outer office to take dictation long
before this hatty must have invested old
man carew with the sacred halo of those
who can raise the brother of abel and not
get called down but nevertheless with-
out a visible tremor she answered the
call which must have sounded like an
order to stop the current in a third rail by
smearing talcum powder on it picking
up miss rosemans shorthand book she
followed old man carew into his cave of
horrors leaving the door partly open

  im-ornt lett-four cops-geroffa-
wuntz crackled the old mans opening
salvo a humanitarian might have trans-
lated this into an important letter is
about to be dictated to you my child
kindly make four copies without delay and
just bring them to me for approval and
the necessary signature so that the letter
may be dispatched immediately

  dalin rluck-oh ne jurzee-tday

with jerks cracklings and explosions
old man carew-shot out this address it
meant that the date line was to be roloco
new jersey the site of the rosmer load-
ing companys plant a war company in
which he was vitally interested and of
which he was an officer and that the let-
ter was to be sent to the firm of messrs
simpson lucknow  delancey pitts-
burgh pa almost everyone in the office
at some time or other had become famil-
iar with the address but in that tense in-
stant it must have been as crystalline to
hatty as a chaldean mud tablet the

whole office sat rigid with a sickening im-
pression of impending calamity johnny
lamb had risen from his desk his lips
open and his eyes fixed in a terrified stare
on the partly open door of old man
carews private office he sank weakly
into the chair before miss rosemans
desk which hatty had just left some
papers which he had carried fluttering
from his fingers over the typewriter
with a flurry of his shoulders as though
to shake off the tragedy achieving itself
in the private office of the old man he
mechanically stuffed paper into the type-
writer bent over his scattered notes and
clicked merrily away at the keys

  old man carews characteristic and
strangely fascinating volleying of a busi-
ness letter stopped with an ominous
break

  why in ten thousand cripes didn ye
take that  he suddenly bellowed

  take what came the clear voice of
hatty

  there was a sound of choking

  take what shrieked the old man
the letter i was givin you

  oh- her voice was charged with
honest surprise was that a letter i
thought you was hiccupin

  it was a full minute before another
sound was heard then like the bursting
of a barrage the old mans voice roared
out against the horrid quietness that was
broken only by the noise of chubby
lambs frantic typewriting

  get out get out old man carew
howled get out and never come back
-never come near here unless you bring
me that letter perfect whatn-whatn
ten thousand blazes did you think i called
you in here for-to sing way down on
the suwanee river

  simultaneously hatty appeared in the
  your job will be waiting when you get back

doorway she didnt seem much upset
but she was holding miss rosemans red-
lined pad upside down and crinkling her
nose in the direction of the old man

  well of all the noive she said so
distinctly that he must have heard her
of all the noive  he must be sick 
she marched over to johnny lamb
say johnny was that there riot what
you call bein fired she demanded as
though johnny were the guilty party

  he started rose and unwound his
written sheets from the typewriter

  here hatty he said cramming the
four sheets carbons and all into her
hands sit down for a minute and read
em over and take em to him tell
him you never had a previous oppor-
tunty of getting next to his peculiar
manner of dictatin but that when it
comes to memory youre a bear

  she looked at him with wide eyes
oh she exclaimed and for all her
amazement there was a new softness in
her voice dye mean this is the stuff
he was shootin off bout in there-all
done-all o k 

  johnny smiled shifted awkwardly and
nodded

  johnny lamb youre what i call one
real white gent ill tell the world

  she pressed his hand with a warmth
of gratitude and tenderness so unusual
to her metallic bright little self that his
blood pounded along with a thrill and
a trill

  thanks-not tall he mumbled
blushing furiously and confused

  five minutes later chin perkily up and
rustling four sheets of paper defiantly
before her hatty breezed toward the
old mans den and disappeared a mo-
ment later she reappeared head even
higher

  great blazes came from old man
carew as she crossed the threshold of
his private office look here

  she turned there was a pause and
he came and stood before her bent over
the letters looking so hard for an error

that the whole room felt the real strain

  say he exclaimed ten thousand
cripes now young lady-whats your
name 

  hat-miss weller she responded
with inflammable dignity

  well miss weller hereafter when
i got any dictatin to do what mr bains
aint here to take youll stay out there
at your desk and well do it by telep-
athy 

  he darted back into his office and
with a bang of the door behind him
severed himself from the astral influences
of psychic stenography but quick as
he had been in darting back no one ex-
cept perhaps on hatty herself was lost
the fact-the indubitable miraculous
fact-that old man carews perpetual
and deep-grooved scowl had flirted for
a moment with a grin hatty had borne
the gleam of gladness into the old mans
cavern of gloom she crinkled her nose
as the door closed and with one hand
stroking the flat smoothness of her hip-
less figure and the other wiggling the
pencil in her hair against her scalp she
repeated distinctly

  well-of all the noive

  through the succeeding weeks at little
odd moments johnny lamb found op-
portunities to hover about hatty with
a kind of half shy wistful joy in her
presence or in inflicting himself on her
lips parted with boyish embarrassment
he seemed nevertheless to thrive upon
the witticisms and slang she flung at
him and the chirpy bright prattle of
her incessant mockery splashed over
him like a delicious summer sea in
spite of the service he had done her in
the matter of old man carews dictation
-wiser psychologists than even mr
denham would have said because of it
-she apparently had singled him out as
the special target of her raciest shafts
but seemingly johnny had become so
devoted to this dragon fly of a girl that
where he should have winced he merely
grinned one evening as she pushed
ferdinand reyher



through the revolving door of the trow-
bridge building and came out on the steps
from which she would step into the day-
is-done tide of humankind hurrying to-
ward elevated stations and subway
kiosks to the bronx and long island
city flatbush and yorkville he was
standing on the pavement in the violet
dusk evidently waiting for someone
she saw his face light up as his eyes
met hers and he stepped up to meet her

  i-i was jus waitin for gus spen-
cer-ydidnt see him anywheres upj
stairs did you he stammered

  she laughed merrily

  gee johnny youre a razzle-dazzle
she hitched her fox piece more snugly
round her neck as if you didnt know
that when the minute hand steps on five
oclock the only thing about gus ye cd
see is the corpses hes leaving behind
him as he goes battling through the ctowd
to make that lenox avenue special
she slipped her hand through his arm
cm on chubby take me to the sta-
tion 

  so having it made easy for him he
escorted her to the subway station to-
gether they fought their way to a ticket
window but quick as he was she was
before him with her nickel and he pushed
after her across the crowded platform
and into a train as packed as a freshly
filled slot machine he was pressed close
against her and at each succeeding sta-
tion the thud of another desperate wedge
of homegoing harlemites squashed them
still nearer to each other unconscious-
ly he strove to stand between her and
the impact of each new host he had
the satisfying glow of the protecting
male he felt something like a knight
standing between his lady and the press
of a rowdy it was good that he got
some satisfaction from this because from
their talk small benefit could have been
derived by either of them what there
was of it was mostly gasps and smoth-
ered imprecations yet chubby was treas-
uring each word and groan that hatty

uttered as something semi-sacred and
beatifically private suddenly she turned
say wasnt that your station

  he blushed but a warm thrill of pleas-
ure ran through him at her question she
knew where he lived there was de-
licious intimacy about that he had
known it was his station but he an-
swered 

oh-eh-wha-wha-ill be-so it
was emboldened he added i dont
care im seeing you home get me 
she looked up at this new assertive
johnny with an appreciative mockery

  huh she exclaimed yre fraid
ill miss my stop

  he gripped her elbow which in the
jam of the train had long been iden-
tified with his floating ribs

  dont you worry what i think
gee don you see me gettin gray
doin that

  im stickin tye close little one like
a postage stamp

  say ye don put much of a price on
yr compny do ye youd have tbe ten
of yourself to be worth twenty cents to
me or thirty

  say talkin of price-i could even
buy you a dinner

  an a movie after she mocked
  the best in the town

  lawd an me poor old mother
waitin home with the bean soup and
the stew

  they were at her station now and
he walked with her up the stairs out into
the clear cool harlem evening at the
corner she stopped

  dye wan me to lend y a nickel to
get back on she said hinting his dis-
missal

  its a fine night for a walk he an-
swered sentimentally

  lifes too short-ye better get a taxi
and be natural no matter what the doc-
tors been telling you

  listen hatty now-

  go on-go on-lot you care if my
stew gets cold


your job will be waiting when you get back

  listen- johnny lamb began

  aw gee go on aint you satisfied
im standin in front of you dye wan
me to put on a listnin tube

  when are ye goin out to dinner with
me an a show or anything you wana
do like a dance or somethin see
see she mimicked with scorn say
wha dye think i lisen with-my eyes 
she looked up at him laughingly and
gripped his arm go on go on fair
one tell me some more-dinner show
dance an anything i wana do-keep
on its like music to my ears me bein
a poor kid fm harlem with no pleasures
o me own

  her patter of mockery disturbed him
and quick to see that perhaps he really
was hurt she said impulsively

  hones johnny mas all ready with
the add-hot-water-and-serve sotll have
tbe runnin but lisen ol dear any
night any place you say-tell me tmor-
rer when the big times cornin off
nighty-night

  a quick pressure on his fingers and
she was gone leaving johnny lamb in
a state of beatific trance

  they had exactly three big times to-
gether the first took place three days
after the evening on which he had made
the initial excursion to harlem with her
and the third and last one week later
this occasion was a gala event for johnny
lamb imbued for him with something of
an international flavor after they had
departed from their american business
office on that great night they had dinner
at an italian restaurant with spaghetti in
strings as long and slippery as the piave
with a final spurt through demi-tasse an
apple a brick of neopolitan ice cream
and a domino of camembert cheese they
hurried to a french musical comedy in
which an english actor was starring
they concluded with a yellow peril a
tete-a-tete over an inlaid marble-topped
teak wood table and a steaming mes of
chop suey that well-known midnight in-
door sport of longacre square and col-

umbus circle it was as they walked
arm in arm from the harlem station
through the desolation of that province
to hattys home that they reverted to
their inalienable american citizenship
again for a time johnny had been
strangely silent

   gee johnny hatty burst out finally
ill admit they ring the curfew up here
in the suburbs but at that they cant do
no moren pinch you for conversation
be a sport now and shatter the stilly night
vith a few well chosen remarks on any-
thing will ye 

   for answer he pressed her arm closer
hones-hones hatty-when i get
to thinkin this is the las time maybe ill
have a chance to see ye-why aw gosh
girl cant ye see i havent got much
heart left to chew the rag

  the las time she stopped short
disengaging her arm and gripping his
she looked up close into his face the
las time-say whats the answer 

   he fancied there was a tremor of solici-
tation in her words and the fancy warmed
his heart

   im drafted he said i go t-mor-
rer

  why-why didnt ye tell me she
asked slowly gee i never even guessed
you was goin so soon

   itd a been sooner but old man carew
begged me not tenlist    an my
mofher and sister was both dependent
an-well im goint-morrer

  there was a heavy silefice between
them

   youll write tme she asked

  you bet and you

   ill do it if i have to use miss wasser-
mans machine

  they had reached her door as she
stood facing him he gripped her arms and
drew her close to him his eyes were
gleaming near to hers his lips an inch
from her lips

  hatty- his voice was husky-
im not goin to say it now-but when

i	come back to you im goin to say-to
ferdinand reyher



say-i love you hatty   in an iron
hold that was expressive of a new un-
recognizably masterful johnny lamb she
was drawn almost fiercely to him and he
kissed her for a long minute she felt
held from the ground and then as her
toes touched the pavement again he sud-
denly released her and in an ecstasy of
panic he turned and fled

  that was johnny lambs real farewell
to hatty she saw him the next day
when he came to say good-by to his
friends in the office but almost shame-
facedly he avoided her the incurable and
genuine shyness that was characteristic
of johnny lamb having in the meantime
visualized all manner of indignations in
the mind of hatty which that highly
sophisticated young gothamite certainly
never felt as a matter of fact she was
actually piqued that he made no fuss over
her in the office as he shook hands and
said good-by foolish johnny lamb he
could have kissed her again because in
the first place kisses as kisses meant
nothing vastly significant to hatty in
the second place all the movie actresses
and society girls in canteens and enlisting
booths had made kissing potential dough-
boys an act approximately as thrilling as a
handclasp the office would have laughed
and made near-witty remarks-and there
as far as the public was concerned the
matter would have ended the kiss he
had given her the night before had really
stirred something in the deeps of hattys
apparently frilly little soul it was not
like other kisses she still thrilled to it
and now-

  good-by hatty ill write ye said
johnny

  ill bet all the words youll send mell
give yo writers cramp she answered
will you write as many

  if i dont ill knit ye a pair o straw-
berry socks

  slong

  fare thee well my darling boy

  so johnny went to a southern camp
spent his first leave of absence in quar-

antine with mumps and his second in
quarantine with measles and shortly after
recovering sailed for france from a
southern port on the well-known atlantic
without reappearing in new york hatty
received eight letters and a post card
from him answered the first two faith-
fully and in corresponding length and
cheated cruelly on the others owing the
lad when he left something like a thou-
sand words of neglected reply she got
his photograph-photograph of corporal
john raleigh lamb-when he was on the
high seas and at the moment when he was
pitching in a coquettish storm indiffer-
ent to her indifferent to life itself the
needs of france war love-anything ex-
cept the gyrations of a stomach which
had never been brought up to be a sailor
had he known at that moment he would
have been miserably indifferent to the
very slight thrill his photograph evoked
in her he wouldnt have cared had she
torn it across but fortunately he knew
nothing of the fact that the picture of
corporal john raleigh lamb shared an
unimportant place on her dresser behind
a can of powder a vanity case and a jar
of cold cream with three other youths in
khaki her cousins and freddy mawser
whom she had always known without
ever having been elated to any pitch of
fervor by it for when johnny was sail-
ing the high seas and hating life with the
terrible hatred of a rebelling stomach
hatty was sailing on a strange exciting
sea of personal adventure a sea upon
which however the wraith of johnny
lambs one fervent kiss occasionally fell
like a reminding shadow

ii

  in the spring of  johnny lamb
returned to new york on a troopship wel-
comed by aldermen and a committee the
formation of which had caused more con-
troversy than the league of nations
he had lolled about france for almost a
 your job will be waiting when you get back

year before his regiment was sent into
action and then he arrived in time
for the tail end of a very minor skirmish
he wore no crosses was never mentioned
in the orders or disorders of the day was
unkissed by french ladies or french gen-
erals and altogether having been pre-
pared to do his duty had done it without
fuss and feathers as the great unmen-
tioned thousands have done it and was
glad-the phrase is damned glad-to
spot the sky line of manhattan again
he had no subtle soul awakenings no
psychic spiritual transformations he
went forth johnny lamb and he came
back johnny lamb despite the corporal
honors he had been the same sunshiny
chubby in camp and in france that he
had been in the office of morningfield
carew  mccullough and in that big
shy sunshiny heart of his he still carried
one picture-the vision of hatty weller
forever vitalized by the kiss he had given
her in the discreet and cemetery-like
somnolence of harlem at  a m over
a year ago so having laid clear the war
record of johnny lamb it is time to re-
turn to hatty and the end of the winter
of 

  curiously enough after the rebuff she
had given mr holling re the matter of
impromptu drinking cups folded out of
bond paper legal size hatty became
vaguely aware that his attitude toward
her had undergone a radical change she
was utterly bowled over one afternoon
when mr holling gratuitously walked
across the room and apropos of nothing
stated

  a wonderfully fine day isnt it miss
weller 

  hatty stared at him somewhat as
though he had announced lets can
the work and go down to brighton for a
swim-they say the waters fine in feb-
ruary 

  he repeated

  simply wonderful weather isnt it

  she painstakingly examined the start-
ling sentence to discover what sarcasm

underlay his words and to her own
amazement finding none responded sol-
emnly 

  mr holling you speak words of wis-
dom and its a pleasure to meet such a
fine observer

  whereupon mr holling far from be-
ing his usual ruffled self at her reply
actually smiled a great beaming semi-
human smile

  let me get this right said hatty
quickly it was your great aunt what
died wasnt it mr oiling and left you
all that money

  he laughed the whole office now
stared at this astounding outbreak of
hilarity on the part of the grand secre-
tary of the-i-will-glooms

  that evening as hatty homeward
bound was entering the elevator mr
holling stepped in behind her

  pretty good to call it a day eh mr
holling said as an effort at small talk

  callin it a day mr holling an-
swered hatty is what fills me with
heavy sorrer evry evenin

  he walked beside her down the cor-
ridor toward the revolving doors of the
entrance and he was beside her when
she came out on the street

  going over toward the subway mr
holling asked and without delaying for
her reply touched her arm and went with
her her surprise at the general evi-
dences of thawing taking place in the
frosted top soil of the man next to her
was not lessened by the fact that hatty
who knew all that was to be known of
the personal habits of the people with
whom she worked was aware that mr
holling never went home on the subway
but took the elevated at a station which
lay in the opposite direction

  somehow she was not able to frisk in
front of mr holling and lay her nickel
on the little glass shelf of the ticket win-
dow ahead of him as she had done with
johnny lamb and mr holling preced-
ing her with two tickets to the chopper
stood aside there while she passed him
ferdinand reyher



and then dropping the tickets into the
box followed her to the platform

  in the few cubic inches of space in-
side the train which they had won for
themselves mr holling deftly sliced
open an evening paper he shifted one
shoulder round in front of hatty so that
she could glance over the sheet also

  what do you think of that ex-
claimed mr holling the president
has issued a statement upholding gar-
fields closing order

  that means the thetres an evry-
thingll be shut down don it

  it looks that way

  gee aint the war fierce she ex-
claimed passionately

  so-mcadoos appointing a railroad
wage commission i wonder what that
will signify mr holling brooded
aloud with an inflection in his voice
however that was the first appeal that
had ever been made to hattys intellec-
tual discretion

  say turn to the comics said hatty
a faint shiver ran through mr hol-
ling under the proper-rules-of-proce-
dure-crust of him there was perhaps
a reservoir of humor dried up through
long parched years of efficiency that liv-
ening streams might again fill he turned
to the comic sheet for the first time and
with that simple act started himself on
the backward track toward the lost
laughter of his youth

  mr holling raising his hat gallantly
in farewell among a hedge of arms and
iron hand-loops left hatty at grand
central station she had been vaguely
wondering whether he were going to see
her home and vaguely disturbed at the
prospect she was already flushing se-
cretly at the thought of the various
slangy attacks she had made upon mr
holling during the course of their en-
counters in the office she began to
sense that this new mr holling was in-
tent upon proving that in addition to
being a regular business man he was
at neart a regular guy as well mr

holling was after all a figure of im-
portance in the concern of morningfield
carew  mccullough and as such even
impurely social relations could not be so
flippantly regarded as johnny lamb

  as the days went on it became ap-
parent that by one of those freaks of the
law of sex attraction mr clarence hol--
ling forty-eight years of age and with
a record clean of entangling alliances
with the charms of femininity to say
nothing of being the recipient of a week-
ly salary much larger than the total
monthly wages of hattys father had be-
come very definitely interested in that
fathers daughter mr holling evincing
a surprising instinct for advancing his
cause for one so untutored in the great
game did not lose but gained in dig-
nity in hattys eyes he was really very
wise several times he rode as far as
grand central station with her in the
evening several times he accidentally
met her at luncheon on those rare oc-
casions when she forsook a clattering
marbled coffee-and emporium for the
tea shop round the corner several times
per day he could find a moment in which
to say a pleasant word to her and pleas-
ant unprofessional words from mr hol-
ling during business hours had a value all
their own several times he walked to
her subway station tipped his hat and
walked back to his own elevated station
several times he made to her little subtle
suggestions indicative of his interest in
her success very very subtle was mr
holling in these suggestions and it was
from him that hatty heard first the
magic word career applied to herself
yet it was all accidental seemingly all
in passing he gave no air of plotting
to bring about these occurrences he
had none of the youthful stress and strain
of johnny lamb dog faithful in ex-
pressions of eye and lips awkward hands
and stumbling speech each of mr hol-
lings slightest attentions to her caressed
her like flattery each had distinction
he spoke a deliberately careful english
 your job will be waiting when you get back

to liar and hatty long entrenched in the
ancior of instantaneous slang felt that
his sentences reproved with loving cor-
rection her own maltreatment of lan-
guage she consequently lost in speech
with him a bit of her cheeky independ-
ence  imperceptibly she was toned down
and whole hours passed when she forgot
to replace the verbal chip that she had
always carried upon the trim georgette
curve of her lovely little shoulder

  it was five minutes of five and hatty
began zigzagging across the outer office
toward the dressing room

  miss weller

  only two people called her miss wel-
ler in the office-old man carew and
mr holling she turned mr holling
was coming toward her a sheaf of pa-
pers in his hand

  miss weller the office is frightfully
crowded for time theres a special job
to be done on these papers and miss
tracy who was to go over them has
just told mr carew that she cannot stay
to-night-shes going down to washing-
ton at midnight and has to pack will
you help us out-i can show you what
has to be done by going over these with
you for a few minutes

  hatty gasped miss tracy leaving
and she was being asked to step into her
place even if it were for only one even-
ing

  why sure mr holling ill call up
and tell my mother im not cornin home
for dinner

  fine dont worry about your din-
ner-well have that together

  until this evening hatty had been a
kind of free lance in the office a sort of
independently operating bureau of trivial
information and petty emergencies
now for the first time she was assuming
the importance of a definite cog in the
machinery of morningfield carew 
mccullough

  do you know what i should do if i
were you  said mr holling a little later
as they sat in the restaurant he had

evidenced the craft of his courtship in
this matter of dinner too as they went
out together from the office he had said
to her now we can only allow our-
selves thirty minutes for dinner ill
regret it more than you wilj of course
and he had smiled pleasantly this is
what i should do if i were you he con-
tinued i should study business meth-
ods office detail and every bit of work
that came my way as though they were
chapters of some new racy novel miss
weller heres your big chance men
are leaving us every day the girls are
leaving us day and night and at the same
time the necessity of the times demands
that we keep right on speed up and even
expand if ever you had a chance here
it is stay with morningfield carew 
mccullough and the firm will not forget
you and everything possible will be done
to broaden your opportunities do you
know i think youre an exceptional per-
son i can speak frankly cant i  well
you have had no training worth speaking
of youve never really taken things
seriously simply because you were never
trained to do so now the time has come
when the big chance belongs to those who
are equipped not with training but with
ability ability you honestly have will
you give nie the opportunity of being
very good friends with you-and of help-
ing you 

  he looked with candid gaze across the
table at her

  well-i don see exactly how we can
be enemies after that she answered
his offer was worded hardly so much as
an offer as an expression of interest in
her but there was in his words a warmth
of cordiality that vaguely startled her

  shake hands on it he said

  as she shook hands with him she
broke into laughter

  say what is this a lodge meetin o
the thirty-first amalgamated alliance of
soft soapers 

  he started somewhat but his parched
reservoir of humor had been sufficiently
ferdinand reyher



replenished in the last few weeks to rip-
ple a response to the gust of her sense of
humor

  you wait and see what develops be-
fore you try to label this meeting he
answered youre going to have a real
career in the business world open out
before you

  it was the second time he had used
the magic word career in application
to her

  hatty did not get miss tracys job at
once but the first time she held it for
almost a week before a miss silverstein
came to grace morningfield carew 
mccullough with the glittering and
brand new array of commercial arma-
ment she had just purchased with fifty
dollars and a few weeks attendance at a
business college miss silverstein had
been in the office only a week when the
well-known roar sounded from old man
carew office telling the others that miss
silverstein was going to washington
the old man fuming out of his private
grotto of wrath a little later stopped
dead before hatty and suddenly bel-
lowed at her

  ten thousand cripes now why dont
you go to washington next

  oh i guess ill stick round a bit
she answered unabashed you people-
ve been pretty white tme

  he glared at her turned on his heel
without another word and retired to his
burrow a few minutes later mr hol-
ling was seen entering old man carews
private office he came out went back
to his desk and another few minutes
elapsing the old man himself reappeared
and bellowed across the room

  miss weller cm here 

  strangely this time hatty entered into
old man carews presence with greater
trepidation than upon that memorable
occasion when she went in to take his
dictation

  holling tells me youre a pretty clever
body that cost and percentage charting
vou was doing when miss tracy left

didnt prove no such thing however
however however miss weller ill give
you nother chance ill treat you easy
fr three or four days  but then-youve
got to have that work abslutely in hand
dye understand ill give ye till then
tget onto miss tracys old work and
its got to be done perfect then

  hattys eyes opened wide miss tracy
had been an old employe she was an ex-
pert typist and stenographer and al-
though she was never called upon to take
shorthand notes she had spent on the
average of half of each day in type-
writing

  bu-but i aint no stenographer-i
cant typewrite-you know that dont
you mr carew

  know that great blazes do i know
that o course i know that there aint
no such thing as a stenographer left so
dye think id think you could be one
mr hollings goin to tell you what
you got to know about this new work
therell be a lot o typin to do and youll
have to dictate notes and stuff what-
ever there is you give t miss rosamere
shell be assigned tyou youre her boss
now see

  hatty nearly fainted estelle rosa-
mere that regal squirrel-collared blond
hattys stenographer hatty weller
boss over miss rosamere the disdainful
miss rosamere in a half trance she
rose and wafted herself out of old man
carews office with another dream zephyr
to drift her farther skyward following
her in the form of his last words

  but its my good advice tye to pick
up typewriting and shorthand as speed-
ly as possible miss weller your payll
be twenty-two-fifty if you make good
hatty made good for once life lost
its carnival aspect for her and she en-
listed in the sober ranks of the serious-
minded it is true that miss rosamere
was unable to stand the preposterous and
ignominous insult to her regal granduer
when asked to consider harriet weller
as her immediate superior but the day
 your job will be waiting when you get back

after miss rosamere left presumably
for washington a neat demure little
creature named genevieve marks was
engaged as hattys assistant

  the chances of war even those behind
the front and on this side of the atlan-
tic have been so variously fully and
pertinently described that it would be
tedious and behind the times merely to
recount the story of hattys steady ac-
quisition of personal ability and import-
ance in the firm of morningfield carew
 mccullough during the year 
freakish as had been its beginning both
ability and importance grew together nor
abated on that great day in november
when hatty in company with an office
of enraptured men and women again
destroyed great quantities of bond paper
legal size cutting the white sheets into
small pieces and giving her assistance
to the creation of that impromptu snow-
storm which on armistice day whirled
through the canyons of lower manhattan
from thousands upon thousands of win-
dows

  it had been an unfolding year for
hatty more and more intimate had she
and mr holling become-they were
hatty and clarence to each other outside
the office now in the summer mr hol-
ling had purchased an automobile she
was the first invited to ride in it on
armistice day they rode about the mad
holiday streets together until late night
shortly before midnight they were din-
ing in a famous chop house in the theat-
rical belt mr holling flushed with the
rejuvenating excitement of the day and
a whole world turned young bent toward
her his eyes gleaming suddenly he
drew her hand to his lips and kissed her
slim cool fingers

  it was the first time mr holling had
ever touched her with his lips she knew
he was devoted to her she was too keen
not to realize that sooner or later his
devotion would no longer be satisfied
with mere arm-in-arm saunterings mo-
tor rides pleasant courtesies theatre

companionships and so on yet this kiss
he set upon her ungloved fingers made
her start strangely it marked the divid-
ing line between the friend who was fifty
and a lover who was fifty mr holling
had always been the pattern of respect-
fulness to her there was a kind of
scrupulous propriety even in the kiss he
had just given her hand during the
summer he had taken her several times
to a house he had bought and was re-
modeling in white plains without a
definite hint without any sentimental in-
nuendoes he had nevertheless made it
clear to her this was the house to
which in the next summer he wished to
bring his wife in almost a year of in-
timate friendship he had made himself
years younger through daily companion-
ship with her exuberant youth it was
indeed a rejuvenated mr holling who
sat across from her now still tightly
holding her hand in that year also he
had cleverly made her dependent upon
him as she never before had been depend-
ent upon anyone mr holling had seen
to it that henceforth he should be asso-
ciated in hattys mind with the best
things the most generous future could
bring her from a modest but highly ef-
ficient motor car to a modest but utterly
sufficient and lovely home in a pretty
suburb all these things so expensive in
the market places were hers-and all he
asked in exchange was merely a com-
modity common enough-her youth just
her youth

  again he kissed her fingers

  youth that compound of reckless-
ness impulse vision and generosity for
just a second as his lips pressed upon her
fingers the memory of another kiss fer-
vent rapt almost religious in its inten-
sity of adoration came to her and she
thought of johnny lamb but only for
a second the man before her had been
her workmate and playmate for so long
that there was on his face the sheen of a
flare-back to youth stolen from her bright
treasure of twenty years
ferdinand reyher



  hatty he said beseechingly across
the table at her

  hatty put her other hand over his and
drew his fingers to her lips and kissed
them in answer that night as he left
her at the door of her home he kissed
her on the lips but still mr holling
was not in a hurry

  in spring dear when things have
quieted down well get married and im
going to take you to the little house

  the morning after armistice day
hatty received three letters at once from
johnny lamb simple forthright notes
they were sunshiny homesick faithful
johnny lamb was his undisguised self
in every line of them the promise of
world peace again taking form hatty
felt a glow of good will to that boy over
in france a glow which was dampened
only by a vague impression that she had
not-perhaps she hadnt played him fair
she couldnt quite decide how she had
failed him there was nothing between
them really a kiss an implication
that when he v returned he was going to
tell her he loved her  she shrugged her
shoulders

  mr burleson had not been kind to
johnny lamb in the matter of carrying
the boys letters to hatty three or four
of them had been lost two or three had
arrived so late that they came with the
effect of anti-climaxes having been pre-
ceded by other notes written later these
last three coming in a batch of tender-
ness and outpouring laughter and senti-
ment mixed in the bright concoction that
was johnny lamb himself came also too
late to bring their recipient to that stage
of appreciation for their author to which
she might have been stirred if she had
received them even the night before the
armistice

  shortly after receiving news from
johnny lamb the fates arranged a
weird coincidence whereby hetty re-
ceived something else once again old
man carew called her into his private
office and there were present mr hol-

ling arthur routledge nathan burbarg
miss solon esther wingate and may
oreilly there were also imposing ar-
rays of charted papers stacks of memo-
randa and index cards upon the old
mans desk when hatty and may
oreilly and mr holling went out to-
gether about two hours later she realized
that the first great shift in wrenching
back the expanded activities of morn-
ingfield carew  mccullough from a
war basis to a peace footing had taken
place of course the conference that she
had just attended had been no conference
at all old man carew following some
secret sessions with mr denham mr
holling and graff mccullough had
simply dispersed a flock of new orders
but these new orders pointed to reor-
ganization the big shoprooms on east
eighteenth street were to be given over
to some new venture in salesmanship in
charge of mr denham who was to leave
the main office this would put mr hol-
ling second in command in the main of-
fices furthermore in the new division
of the work just assigned them by old
man carew hatty perceived that her
coming duties would be largely those for-
merly johnny lambs in fact she may
oreilly and nathan burbarg together
did the work formerly done by johnny
lamb miss tracy and dick bostick
who left for camp shortly after johnny
had gone

  hatty separated herself from may and
mr holling and drifted through the big
room toward one of the great windows
she stood there looking out on the no-
vember noon and suddenly the problem
of johnny lamb confronted her as vivid-
ly as the opposite skyscraper when
johnny came marching home-what
she could not suppress a thrill of triumph
at the thought that she had proved herself
as good as he in fact when he left his
salary was thirty-two and a half dollars
per week and hatty already getting
thirty dollars was confident that her
wage would again be raised-at least to


your job will be waiting wthen you get back

thirty-five when johnny came march-
ing home-what she felt a new in-
tense love for the work she felt at that
minute she would fight to hold it not
even to be mrs clarence holling would
she give it up under mr hollings edu-
cational promptings she had read articles
on womans work after the war
and had listened to several exceedingly
plausible women preachers whose eternal
text was

  what the women have gained during
the war they do not intend to relinquish
in peace

  she had become well acquainted with
the magic word career and even the
phrase womens rights social civil and
political had no terrors for her when
johnny came marching home--what

  that night when mr holling bent to
kiss her as they stood before her door
she again thought incongruously enough
of johnny lamb involuntarily she
turned her head slightly so that the kiss
fell on her cheek

  on thanksgiving day mr holling
presented her with a handsome nutria fur
coat with a wolf collar it was his most
sumptuous present to her so sumptuous
indeed that it almost alarmed her mother
but that lady who had as much of what
was once fondly termed parental con-
trol over her daughter as a weather vane
has over the winds wisely said nothing
on christmas mr holling outdid the
fur coat with a flawless solitaire which
with a little speech reassured mrs wel-
ler senior and the engagement of har-
riet weller to clarence holling was
thereby announced to the family

ill

  then johnny did come marching
home

  it was a beautiful april day with the
world swathed in a delicious softness as
delicate as lavender tulle hatty saw him
almost first of all and he certainly for

the moment saw no one else in the big
outer office but her swiftly he went to
her and took both her hands

  hatty he whispered as he gripped
her fingers

  she looked up into his wide blue sun-
shiny eyes a whirl of panic seizing her
suddenly something in her heart seemed
to break away from the moorings to
which she had tied herself with mr hol-
lings aid-and she had the impression of
staggering out into a great storm-bound
void the actual corporeal johnny lamb
was so much more vital than her memory
of him

  hello my hero she giggled afraid
that he would kiss her afraid that he
would not baffled by both fears

  the comparatively few men and women
who had been in the office when he had
worked there crowded round him to her
relief and it was fully a half hour before
he reached the door of old man carews
private office mr holling stood there

  i wan to see the ol-mr carew
said johnny

  hes out now lamb is there any-
thing i can do for you

  there was a cool edge of antagonism
in mr hollings voice

  out whenll he be back
  sometime this afternoon

  wheres mr denham

  hes not in this office any longer he
has charge of the eighteenth street
building mr holling scrutinized with
an almost impersonal dislike the well-
built tanned boy in uniform before him
is there anything i can do for you  he
repeated

  well its jus this i don wan to
waste any time ive got my discharge
and i wan to start right in again dye
think mr carew  wan me t cm in
the mornin

  mr holling coughed slightly

  well lamb you see its this way he
said softly i rather think theres no
vacancy here just now-in fact i know
there isnt weve taken one or two of
ferdinand reyher



the men back but the work has been so
radically changed and the whole place so
reorganized that weve been unable to
give quite a number of the others their
old places you see it wouldnt be fair to
those who have learned the game in the
meantime

  with open-mouthed incredulity john-
ny lamb looked up at him

  no vacancy just now you havent
taken the ol boys back it wouldnt be
fair-fair to them thats taken our
places 

  im sorry of course-

  i cant get my old place back -why
the ol-mr carew promised me my
jobd be waitin for me here when i got
back mr holling

  unfortunately mr carew himself
could not have foretold at that time the
extent of the changes that would take
place

  whos got my job

  well no one person lamb its
really been split up and joined with other
jobs miss weller for example is doing
one part of it

  dye mean to sav hattys got my
job

  part of it

  turning abruptly on his heel johnny
went over to hatty

  hatty will you have lunch with me
he asked she noticed a determined tilt
to his chin

  she had promised mr holling that
morning to lunch with him so she mo-
mentarily hesitated

  yes she said finally

  as abruptly as he had left mr holling
johnny now turned and left hatty he
went down to the street bought himself
a package of cigarettes half smoked
three of them and went back for hatty
in the hallway he met harry beddoes
who had also been in france and was
now back in his old place in the office

  howd you slip in johnny asked
him curiously

  aint they takin you back

-l s

 nope no vacancy at present-
t wouldn be fair to them that suffered
here while i was in france see

  youre the fifth they turned down
ned hawkins abe lil cutey cunning-
ham rudens an you oh an frank

beddoes with the smug judicial air of
the securely placed

  i cant cant i exclaimed johnny

me from in back eh ill see if i cant
hate em for that

  he stalked into the outer office feeling
as though he would like to pitch mr
holling out of the window and follow
that gentlemans flight with a few well-
chosen selections from the rest of the
firm hatty was waiting for him a hu-
man tempest of emotions-puzzled at
his sudden departure before wondering
vaguely if he really intended to come
back for her hoping he wouldnt hoping
he would  fearing their meeting praying
for it she had told mr holling of
johnnys luncheon invitation shrewdly
 your job will be waiting when you get back

mr holling had urged her to go he
had no intention of enhancing the at-
tractiveness of any rival by putting forth
objections that hatty in all probability
would not have regarded moreover
mr holling had seen that the boy was
raw with disappointment and this with
all the coaching he had given hatty on
the importance of her job and her career
promised to create a situation that would
make of this luncheon the last occasion
that johnny lamb and hatty weller
would have for any confidences he
even went out before johnny returned

  as the two sat in the furthest corner
of the somewhat out-of-the-way tea room
to which johnny had led her he sensed
the change in hatty but more import-
ant than this for the first time he recog-
nized a change in himself he had gone
away johnny lamb he had come back
johnny lamb but between coming back
and this moment something had hap-
pened there is really no such thing as
class consciousness in america but the
war has created this a pal consciousness
and an age consciousness men who
have stood tiptoe on the brink of hell for
over a year in company with thousands
of their fellows of similar viewpoint-
americans all-have become imbued
with the sense of the cohesiveness of
youth and laughter and similar ambitions
he felt all this now as he sat there
facing the problem he had never dreamed
would be his-the problem of his right
to work which involved the goodwill and
the pledged word of the nation itself to
safeguard his interests while he was
away guarding the safety of the nation-
johnny lamb felt that he was not alone
but that he represented a million others
that he was spokesman for every lad in
sea-going blue and flanders mud khaki
and when he did speak his very voice was
deeper vibrant with the massed volume
of inaudible other voices

  it was not until the gap that preceded
their dessert that he said

  holling told me this morning that the

old man wouldnt give me back my job
that there aint no vacancies and that
it wouldnt be fair to chuck out anybody
who suffered in my place while i was off
takin a trip for m health what dyou
think bout it hatty

  he watched her keenly across the
table he noted the air of new effective-
ness about her

  think about it she repeated a little
startled she too sensed the change
that had taken place in him since his first
impulsive two-handed greeting of her
when he had come into the office less than
three hours before perceiving that she
had been thinking about it he leaned to-
ward her awaiting her words as though
they would have the true stamp of final-
ity upon them

  its a give an take proposition isnt
it johnny we-new people came in
gave up old comforts and everything and
took a hand at helpin when the country
was desprate they deserve some con-
sideration don you think they did
their share and now dye wan to turn
em out an tell em to beat it and starve
or somethin jus because a few men
cant find other jobs

  as he listened to her a cold weight
fell for a moment upon the sunshiny
heart of johnny lamb then it van-
ished this was not hattys voice that
he heard the words came hard and
dry cool and merciless selfish and if 
words can be blind they had a quality of
sightlessness about them he merely
looked at her as though she were a
stranger

  this is the period of reconstruction
johnny continued the flaying cruel
young voice with the intonation of one
reciting a selection-for hatty was un-
consciously quoting mr holling in ef-
fect an periods of reconstruction al-
ways make it stiff for some people but
dont you see the last year was a reglar
record breaker all sorts o things was
happnin to business new changes new
workers new methods-an youd have
ferdinand reyher



to begin all over again like a green hand
see an moren that-you cant talk bout
gettin your old job back cause there
aint no such thing as your old job left

see

  he merely looked at her

  whered ye study that he asked al-
most gently theres somethin in your
voice that sounds jus like that double
entry dose o patent business medicine
up in the office named holling

  she flushed furiously and shifted in
her chair

  moren that her voice was higher
with determination not to be belittled it
aint fair to them whats made a career
for themselves now in business with all
sorts o chances openin out ahead of
em for them to drop right out now like
they was just part time substitutes

  his fingers tightened into two hard
fists he leaned his bulk on the table

  hatty - hatty he almost com-
manded you got my job give it back
to me

  she looked at him startled for a mo-
ment and then her fingers too curled
into a firm little ball

  your job she excliamed your
job where dye get that notion tel-
lin me what to give up didnt i earn
it givin up just as much as you did
give up as much as i did whatd
you ever stand to lose nothing youve
got a father and mother to take care o
you i got a mother an kid sister to take
care of and im goin to take care o you
it wasnt even patriotism that brought
you down to the office-it was easy
money an-scuse me hatty for men-
tionin it-a helluvalotta nerve  im not
ever goin to kick against those wimmen
an girls thatve got others to look out
for now holdin down our jobs but
whod you ever have to look out for cept
yourself 

  i guess you think my career don
amount to anything at all eh 

  your what he snorted

  my-my career

  rats he exploded your career
with a thousand men home a day whove
been tacklin doomsday at thirty bucks a
month minus sos you could keep on
chewin gum and powderin your nose
and youre talkin bout a career when
theyre runnin the streets now lookin
for somethin to help em keep their
womenfolks again

  i-i aint no-no baby you talkin
like this to me she stammered reaching
for her gloves and pushing back from
the table

  his hand closed over hers and held it
with the grip which had held the rifle he
had borne for her for sixteen months

  no youre not not before i tell you
one more thing right off the bat any-
how you an mes been apart too long
an it aint goin to happin again he said
in a voice that held her in her chair
i heard bout this job-snatchin over in
france already an i wanna put you
right sos you can tell some of your girl
friends the story beddoes told me up
in the office a little while ago that jobs
is so thick here that a feller could go out
hikin the offices for one for three
months an the only thing hed get would
be blisters you know whats goin to
happen from all this this is whats
goin to happin-youre goin to turn a
mans army into panhandlers and crooks
an all round blue hells goin to happin
and happin soon

  his blue eyes flashed with a transcend-
ent wrath as he leaned white and tense
toward her he seemed to be speaking
at her as though she were the nation not
merely little hatty weller and some-
how it shook her as though her soul were
caught in a gale and to her he appeared
to grow larger and even threatening

  it was me-me what cinched your job
for you one day up there in the office
when you didnt even have a job only
luck an now youd have the real laugh
on me wouldnt you if i wasnt goin to
marry you

 marry me why-i-i-you jus


conventional

wanna marry me for my job she
blurted slandering her own insight

  ferget it i gave you moren any
job hatty i gave you sixteen months
of all my dreamin he said simply

  something in her throat caught as he
spoke and suddenly mr clarence hol-
ling even with the favorable reflection
cast from his automobile and remodeled
house looked all of his fifty years to
hatty all of his kisses then seemed the
frosty peckings of a belated passion
against the memory of that one indubita-
ble kiss the boy before her had once
given her with eyelids blinking she
looked down and opened her handbag
she took out the ring she never wore at
the office but put on only at night when
mr holling took her to dinner or the
theatre she was feminine enough to
hold it out so that he might be impressed
properly by its sparkle

  there she whispered in what she
meant for defiance but which was mere-
ly confusion im-im engaged to mr
holling

  youre-what

  engaged to mr holling her voice
was even lower

  he looked at her steadily for almost
a minute without moving slowly some-
thing like a trickle of sunshine filtered
back into his blue eyes and a smile
spread over his face

  let me see it he said

  he took it and holding it in one hand
felt in the pocket of his tunic with the

other he brought forth a little green
box and opened it a diamond glittered
in the slotted bed of the tiny casket
with a recently acquired connoisseurship
he coolly compared the two jewels fi-
nally he held out mr hollings diamond
and squinted critically at it turning it so
it flashed in the light

  its a beauty ill hand him that he
said judicially maybe its a little bet-
ternn the one youre gone to wear now
but when i get his job ill give you one
thatll make it look like a piece out of a
plate glass window

  he drew her left hand to him and as
though he had spent a lifetime slipping
on engagement rings he placed his dia-
mond ring on her third finger his own
fingers went fumbling in the pocket of
his tunic again

  in about two hours youll be wearin
this he said holding out a plain gold
ring and then youll come back to the
office with me and while i start in again
on the job whats been waitin for me till
i got back youll hand ol double entry
his solitaire

  as their hands came together two
tears of gladness glistened in hattys
eyes and then some way she got her fin-
gers free of his and-

  gee johnny she exclaimed can
you beat it look how it fits 

  there on the principal finger of a
girls left hand the plain gold band al-
ready gleamed sedately beside the bluish
flame of johnnys diamond

the long arm in the clearing

by robert shirley

just around a bend of the cypress-
grown point we came full upon
a house half hidden in the cane-
brakes the silences of the great dis-
mal swamp lent an air of unreality to
this human habitation a house in that
place was as incongruous as a telephone
in pharaohs palace the negro lad who
had rowed me ran his skiff alongside
the splintered plank that served for a
landing stage and i stepped ashore 
dis heahs de place he muttered
and began hurriedly backing his boat
into the canal the sun had fallen low
behind the trees and the lad was fearful
that darkness would find him still in
the mazes of the swamp i threw a
silver dollar into the skiff and started
up the weed-grown pathway to the house

  as i mounted the crumbling steps
one of these gave way and i caught
quickly at the rickety rail to steady my-
self this too splintered under my
hand and i leaped back to the ground
then i observed that the front door was
barred by two rough boards nailed across
it and heavy spider webs crossed and
recrossed from board to lintel and post
as i forced my way through the tall
weeds i gazed curiously at the ruin
of rot and decay wondering what had
possessed my friend jim curtis to come
to such an uninviting place and why
he had sent for me in such a hurry i
pulled the letter from my pocket and
looked at it again it read

dear tom

  the nigger who takes you this will guide
you back to me ive run across a mystery
that is more in your line as a prosecuting at-
torney than in mine besides its getting on

my nerves bring a couple of guns with you
and come

  the darkness was beginning to close
in quite rapidly and i was not particu-
larly enamored of the prospect to be
somewhere in the middle of the great
dismal swamp at seven in the evening
in the midst of a silence that could be
cut with a knife to have the messenger
who had conveyed me hither prove as
communicative as a broiled lobster and
to have him depart as if he were afraid
disaster would overtake him if he de-
layed was sufficiently disconcerting but
to find no trace of the man i had come
to see was annoying

  i made up my mind to investigate the
place while the light still held and with
this idea in mind i turned toward the
kitchen or l that leaned for support
against the main building to one side
as i walked  forward i noticed a cir-
cular plantation of trees close set i
judged them to be tamarack they grew
probably to the height of fifteen feet and
bore evidence of having been at one
time carefully tended and clipped the
foliage was so dense and they were set
so close with their interlacing branches
that they formed a wall as impenetrable
as that of a citadel i wondered idly
what they could enclose for they were
not over fifteen feet from the house

  hello jim hello jim curtis i
called loudly and walked on toward the
kitchen some distance off in the swamp
i heard crashing then the sharp bark of
a dog followed by a mans voice

  hello echoed the voice and i
turned to the opening that gave access to




the long arm in the clearing

the dense thicket a moment later cur-
tis accompanied by a nondescript hound
and carrying a shotgun came into view
from his hand dangled a brace of ducks

  im glad you came he said soberly
shaking hands more glad than you
can imagine he finished significantly

  there was a furtive look in his eyes
and i noted that he glanced nervously
about him as we approached the house
it was as if the gloom of the place had
got into his blood

  whats the mystery and why are you
here  i asked sharply the last i
heard you were in richmond organiz-
ing a power company

  help me chuck together something
to eat and ill spin you the yarn after-
ward he answered kicking open the
ramshackle kitchen door as we came to
it some of it i can give you maybe
while you pick the feathers off one of
those ducks he applied a match to
the wick of an oil lamp standing on a
table

  i stood looking curiously about the
place while curtis set about building a
fire in the stove

  whats that circular clump of trees
for out there i asked as i peeled off
coat and waistcoat

  i dont know he answered shortly
pete-thats the dog here-doesnt ap-
prove of it though he growls and
sticks his back up every time he passes
it a coon probably lives there throw
me that box of matches

  during the process of preparing sup-
per curtis told me that he had always
known he had an uncle somewhere in
the south of virginia but never having
seen him had paid little attention to
the relationship he had recalled hear-
ing his father speak of a brother a
naturalist who lived the life of a recluse
and that the old gentleman seemed de-
liberately to have cut himself off from
this family to pursue his researches cur-
tis was more than a little surprised there-
fore when one morning of the week

before he had received a letter signed
with his uncles name asking him to
come and visit for a day or two on a
matter of some importance

  the letter rambled a little and spoke
vaguely of something that would aston-
ish the scientific world said curtis
ill show it to you later on if you like
anyway having a vacation due a few
days ago i packed a bag and came out
here to see the old chap

  here i echoed startled then
wheres the uncle

  ah theres the mystery he replied
and i caught the apprehension in his
tones well talk about that a little
later on its something that i believe
will be pretty sure to stir up the brain
reactions of the prosecuting attorney of
pasquotank county in a way that will do
him a lot of good

  for your information the said at-
torney feels he has about all the mental
exercise he wants in the ordinary tasks
of his office i replied ive noticed
that north carolina counties seem to
find enough for their officials to do with-
out going outside said counties

huh retorted curtis this isnt
outside this section of the swamp is in
your county so its up to you anyway
after the supper had been cleared off
curtis went straight to the point

  my uncles name is henry curtis
he said as i told you in the note
theres a mystery here that is worth tak-
ing hold of anyway it has given me
half a dozen good hard thrills in the few
days pve been here as a starter id
like to find my uncle

  where has he gone i asked
thats the reason i sent for you
curtis answered as i told you i
packed a bag and came down here when
i got his letter the same nigger who
brought you brought me and he was
afraid to come ashore said there were
devils here however the vital fact is
that when i got here not a sign of my
good uncles presence could i find nor
robert shirley



have i been able to find any trace of
him since that was three days ago
then theres that infernal dog he
wont let me out of sight and shivers
as hes doing now as soon as the sun
goes down

  i looked at the dog he was crouched
close against curtis leg shaking as with
an ague

  perhaps the old gentleman went away
on a little trip not expecting you so
soon i suggested as for the dog
he may be sick

  curtis scratched a match on the table
and lighted his pipe

  gentlemen invariably go away on
little trips without clothing he re-
marked they always get out of their
beds leave their shoes beside a chair
their watch on a table ticking and their
doors bolted on the inside

  i sat up quickly and the dog howled
mournfully

  the door bolted on the-are you
sure  i asked and he grinned ironically

  bring that lamp with you and ill
show you he answered come this
way

  he pushed open the door that led into
the house proper i followed him and
the dog squeezed through between my
legs as if afraid to be left alone

  see that asked my friend with a
look at the animal

  we walked down a short hall that
smelled old and mildewed and stopped
before another door

  this is where the old man slept
curtis remarked taking the lamp from
me he turned the knob and pushed
the door open as he did so the dog
growled savagely and looking at him i
could see the hair rising along his spine
while his fangs showed white

  come on pete said tom to him
but the dog backed away and crouched
close against the wall outside he would
not enter the room curtis pushed at
him with his foot but the animal snarled
viciously and snapped at him

  let him alone i said and with
curtis entered the old mans chamber

  when i got here said my friend
putting down the lamp on the old-fash-
ioned bureau the door was bolted on
the inside as i told you the window
was open about two feet and the dog
was in the room howling when i had
tried the door and found it locked i
went outside and climbed through the
window as soon as i opened the door
the dog nished out as if he had been
frightened half to death 

  how long ago was that i asked
outside in the dark passage i could see
the dogs eyes shining

  three days ago was the answer
the poor beast was half starved of
course ever since hes shivered at
night just as you see him

  but why didnt he jump out of the
window i asked that would have
been easy for him

  answer me that and ill make you
a present replied curtis look here
you see ive left everything just as it
was save that i unbolted the door here
are my uncles things evidently just as
he removed them his clothes neatly
folded over the chair here as you see
his collar tie and scarf pin on the
bureau shoes socks etc on the floor
beside the bed handkerchief and book
within easy reach and his watch on the
small stand as you see it everything
as methodical as you would expect from
a man who has been doing the same thing
for years

  i glanced about the room and found
everything as curtis had described it
the open window again attracted my at-
tention

  why should a man have left his room
by the window when he could have gone
by the door and why would he leave
without his clothes i muttered

  exactly agreed jim and that is
why ive sent for you i tell you theres
a mystery here even if the dog didnt
act the way he does


the long arm in the clearing

  i glanced outside into the passage and
was confronted by the glowing eyes
seized with an idea i walked through
the door and stooped down as if to pat
the animal he was deceived and when
my hand was close enough i grabbed him
by the collar and flung him headlong
into the room with a howl of anguish
the poor brute terror-stricken dashed
back again into the passage and crouched
against the wall

  thats queer i said to myself very
queer what is there in this room to
frighten him so

  outside hes just as friendly as can
be curtis said hes just what a
hound usually is but in the house here
he wont be left alone a minute hes
as skittish and frightened as an old
maid

  what have you done since you landed
here jim i asked

  he did not answer me until he had
closed the bedroom door and we had
returned to the kitchen the dog had
huddled close beside our legs as we
walked down the short passage and now
he flung himself with what might have
passed for a canine sigh of relief be-
fore the fire close against my friend

  ive searched about generally said
jim you see when i first came i
thought just as you suggested that
uncle henry had simply gone off on one
of his little expeditions not expecting
me to come down quite so quickly and
that he would return when he got ready
but the dog in the room i queried
why i supposed he had forgotten
the animal or was in a hurry when he
went away ill confess it did not at
the moment strike me as an ordinary
thing to do for down here a man usually
takes a dog with him later on i began
to wonder why the dog didnt jump out
of the window since then ive gone
everywhere within a reasonable radius
searching for some trace of uncle
henry

  and youve found nothing

 not a hint of him to be frank
with you i hardly expected to for as
i pointed out a man doesnt go off on
excursions with no clothing save for
his night shirt im sure the old man
was as guiltless of clothing as the day
he came into the world the things a
mystery drake

  now im quite convinced that there
is no such thing in life as a real mystery
the term is purely a relative one and
the only reason for the use of the word
in connection with any event is the ab-
sence of all the facts i was sure either
that curtis had not given me all the
facts or that he did not know them
it was therefore up to me to ascertain
them as best i could as may be guessed
by this time i was keenly alive to the
interesting elements in the situation and
entirely outside of my friendship for
curtis it was apparent that it was my
duty to run this thing down to its logical
explanation

  did the old gentleman live here
alone i asked when i had gone over
the main facts as i knew them

  why theres another angle of it that
i forgot to tell you curtis answered
there seems to have been an old scotch-
man named macgregor who lived here
with uncle henry but hes gone too it
seems

  youd better tell me all you know
i said a little ironically for instance
just how much do you know of your
uncles habits

  next to nothing as i told you i
think ive never seen him hes a re-
cluse in a way youll understand bet-
ter when i tell you that he and luther
burbank were born and brought up to-
gether in lancaster massachusetts and
their tastes ran in the same channels
uncle henry was always experimenting
with flowers and plants and things ive
been told that he had some queer ideas
about the relationship between plants
and animals in fact that he was in-
clined to the opinion that plants were
robert shirley



really of the animal kingdom and had
through lack of appropriate nourish-
ment fallen into an atrophic condition
a fellow named belding has endorsed
that since im told anyway he be-
lieved this swamp to be the best place
to experiment on any such theories as
he had and he came here years ago he
had an idea that the conditions here ap-
proached those of the world in the period
of the great mammals i dont know
enough about it to tell you more than
that but over there youll find a shelf
filled with books on the subject from
the look of them the old boy studied
them pretty thoroughly

  i arose and approached the shelf the
books were old and well worn i pulled
down the first one i came to it was
darwins the power of movement in
plants i put it back and took down
the next again it was darwin ef-
fects of cross and soil fertilization
the rest were of a similar character
and i returned to my seat

  then he experimented with plants
i queried

  theres a greenhouse or forcing
house back in the clearing a couple of
hundred feet curtis answered the
place is filled with queer looking things
ill have a look at it to-morrow
i decided instantly now about this
man macgregor who told you about
him

  ben biggotty the boy who brought
you here

  what did he say

  very little he doesnt care for the
scotchman few negroes do i imagine
macgregor has thrashed him probably
or something like that at any rate
there is no love lost between them as
to what has become of the man i have
no idea from what biggoty tells me
macgregor went away as he does two
or three times a year ten days ago
id like to have a look at this man
macgregor i said half to myself after
a few moments thought

  its a pleesure yell be havin th noo
then said a harsh rasping voice almost
at my elbow both of us started as if
we had been shot to find a tall red-
bearded man in shooting clothes stand-
ing in the kitchen the door was wide
open as we jumped to our feet he
came a step further into the room

  an who may ye be he inquired
with a keen glance at each

  it seems to me that if explanations
are in order it might be well to begin
with yours remarked curtis quietly
that will keep us occupied for a time
wheres mr curtis

  the other man smiled and let a heavy
knapsack slip from his shoulders to the
floor

  i ken ye noo he replied yell
be th auld mons nephew fra oop
reechmon way but whas yer fren
by this time it had dawned on me who
our caller was the man macgregor
of course returned from his trip afield
and i stepped forward

  im the prosecuting attorney of this
county mr macgregor i answered
for myself im here in my official ca-
pacity to investigate the disappearance
of mr henry curtis

  the scotchman stared with dropping
jaw

  deesappearance he echoed blankly
is he no here

  unfortunately no i replied his
nephew mr james curtis whom you
see here has been in the house three
days and has been able to find no trace
of his uncle

  the blue eyes of the scot sought those
of my friend and held them the scru-
tiny lasted several seconds then he
sighed deeply

  forbye hes gone explorin he said
quietly hes for doin that noo an
agen

  mr curtis left without his clothes
i observed there is a deep mystery
here mr mcgregor

  i noticed that the dog was fawning


j	 

the long arm in the clearing

upon the boots of the new arrival it
was apparent that the dog recognized
the man as a friend and ill own that
this went far to remove any suspicions
i might have had of him the animal
evinced none of the fear that seemed
to possess him at the sight of the room
in which the tragedy-if it were a
tragedy-had occurred

  curtis explained to mcgregor the
events that had transpired since he had
received the letter from his uncle asking
him to visit the swamp and together
we outlined for the scot the situation as
to the apparent conditions accompanying
mr curtis disappearance it was when
we touched upon the actions of the dog
that macgregor evinced alarm to con-
vince him we were compelled to take
the dog back to the room where he could
witness its terror with his own eyes

  tis verra queer he murmured as
if to himself t beastie wad neer
leave yon room wiout his maister noo
hell no enter it i fear yeer richt when
ye speir theres a great meestery here
we both feel that something mysteri-
ous has occurred in that room i said
mr curtis evidently left in his night
garments

 aye aye answered macgregor
an thats no like him eyether a great
mon for dress he was

  to cut across the corners of descrip-
tion and get down to the plain facts i
may say that while at first i had a sus-
picion that macgregor might have made
away with his employer the man him-
self proved to be a kindly whole-souled
individual of more than ordinary intelli-
gence a naturalist by temperament and
inclination he had associated himself
with henry curtis fifteen years before
when they had met in new orleans
both en route for south america find-
ing him of kindred tastes mr curtis
had invited the scot to enter his employ
nominally as a secretary but actually as
a co-worker the friendship had proved
a permanent one of mutual respect and

liking for three years they had traveled
together in the southern continent and
had come back loaded with theories and
strange specimens

  a great mon henry curtis com-
mented macgregor at last he had
ideas that wad startle the world were
they known

  we talked until nearly midnight it
was decided that i should occupy the
room from which henry curtis had dis-
appeared as we had come to believe

  for heavens sake dont stay there
if you have any feeling about it said
curtis the things queer enough as
it is

  to tell you the truth im so infernal-
ly tired that i doubt if any weird sugges-
tion could keep me awake i answered
i see no reason why i shouldnt stay
there and to-morrow well take a look
at the greenhouse macgregor by the
way im curious to know whats inside
that ring of tamarack trees out there

  the scotchman looked at me strangely

  yeve no been inveestigatin there-
abouts id say he commented

  why no i just wondered what it
was thats all i returned and specu-
lated on the oddity of his manner h
turned away but returned to us

  did ye experience any queer-any
phenomena thot struck ye as peculiar
aboot th place noo he asked

  nothing since ive been here an-
swered curtis mr drake arrived only
this evening come to think of it i
have heard some noises that sounded
like-like a great rope being dragged
about at night

  aye macgregor muttered aye
thered be thot mayhap wi th auld mon
gone three days aye yes he
turned away tugging at his red beard

  ill not pretend that the strangeness
of the scotchmans manner did not im-
press me but also i was so nearly dead
for sleep that i felt if i did not soon
get to bed id topple over onto the floor
whatever dulled suspicions i may have
robert shirley



had i decided would keep profitably un-
til to-morrow when i could tackle them
with a clear head macgregor lighted
another lamp and handed it to me

  im sleeping here on these blankets
in the kitchen said curtis yours is
that room on the other side of the cor-
ridor across from uncles i presume
mr macgregor

  aye thots mine answered the
other an ill be seekin it whas more

  with a brief good night he picked
up his knapsack and left us the dog
followed him to the door stopped looked
back then decided to remain with curtis
and curled himself up on a corner of
the blanket i yawned again and wished
my friend good night

  inside mr curtis room i barely
glanced about for i wished nothing so
much as to get my clothes off and close
my eyes i think i was not above five
minutes in getting between the covers
i did not close the door nor the window
while the night was chill it was not
uncomfortable and i like plenty of fresh
air

  almost at once i began to dream i
dreamed that ben biggoty was trying to
row me away from the house and that
macgregor had a rope tied around my
waist and was trying to pull me out of
the boat and into the water i struggled
mightily and then with a strong heave
he had me over the side of the boat
instead of the cold plunge i expected
however the water was unconscionably
hard for i struck it with a bump that
waked me instantly and i found that
it was no dream i had been dragged
off the bed and onto the floor and the
rope was about my shoulders even as
consciousness returned i found myself
being dragged toward the window and
with all the power of my lungs i shouted
aloud my arms were lashed to my
sides but with herculean effort i suc-
ceeded in freeing one of them and tore
fiercely at the bond that gripped and
dragged me it felt like slimy leather

and i yelled with the fright that was
upon me with the energy of despera-
tion i clutched and tore at the thing
and finally ripped it from me to fly
shouting toward the door daylight was
just appearing in the passage i collided
violently with curtis and macgregor
coming from opposite directions i
could do nothing but point to the room
i had left and they rushed in i caught
a puzzled look on the scotchmans face
and staggered into the kitchen where i
dropped upon a chair completely ex-
hausted the dog was shivering as with
an ague and crouched in the furthest
corner of the room

  for heavens sake what was the mat-
ter old man demanded curtis return-
ing to the room what on earth pos-
sessed you to yell like that were you
dreaming

  i thought i was-at first i an-
swered until i found it was a reality
hush heres macgregor

  the scot hurried in and i noticed that
his face was pale beneath the tan

  i suffer from nightmares occasion-
ally i said casually though my teeth
still chattered with fright and revulsion
that was a particularly bad one sorry
i waked you both

  nightmare eh said macgregor
eyeing me doubtfully im no so sair-
tain o thot mon ye yelled like a steam
whustle

  it was very real i told him i
think ill not turn in again its getting
light

  half-past four said curtis glanc-
ing at the old clock on the kitchen shelf
he stirred up the embers of the fire
the warmth was grateful and i
stretched toward it as i did so i
turned and accidentally glanced out of
the window what i saw prompted me
to an exclamation but i succeeded in
turning it into a cough macgregor
went back to his room to put on some
more clothing the instant he had gone
i dragged curtis to the window
	the long arm

  if your uncle went away i whis-
pered swiftly he went in the garb with
which nature endowed him theres his
nightshirt

  i pointed to the top of the circle of
tamarack trees and sure enough there
fluttered in the morning breeze a white
shirt torn it is true but palpably a night-
shirt curtis turned to me with a
puzzled face

 what does it mean he asked
how could it get up there

  i shrugged my shoulders with a cold
shiver it was as if someone had
touched me with an icicle

  dont ask me my friend i replied
with a chatter of the teeth ask-
macgregor

  im going to ask somebody he an-
swered with a set of the jaw im
about tired of this mystery business
theres a deal too much of it

  im certain macgregor knows some-
thing hes keeping back i said

  curtis turned to me swiftly

  look here he said sharply i want
the facts what was that circus you
kicked up in there you can tell that
nightmare yarn to the marines

  it was a nightmare and a horrible
one i said but it was also more than
that then i described to him in detail
the experience as i have already related
it

  but such a things absurd curtis
said i could understand it if we were
upon the seacoast but you cant find
octopi about here

  i dont know anything about that
i said but i do know that something
like an enormous tenacle had me around
the waist and was dragging me to the
window-

  curtis took me by the shoulder and
shook me gently

  are you sure it wasnt just a dream
tom he asked for an instant i hesi-
tated then the memory of that horrible
moment swept over me and i stamped
my foot upon the floor

in the clearing

  as sure as im standing here talking
to you i replied with all the solemnity
i could put into the statement

  macgregor probably felt the sus-
picion we had both begun to feel about
him for he withdrew into himself and
maintained a glum silence until i spoke
directly to him

  im going to take a look at that green-
house of yours this morning i told him
and he nodded

  whenever youre feelin like it he
said without enthusiasm ill be put-
tin away th specimens i brocht wi me
fra the everglades th noo

  the everglades exclaimed curtis
is that where youve been

  certainly replied the scotchman
twice a year ill be makin a trip there-
abouts for specimens o plants he
smiled i never held wi all yer uncles
notions particularly aboot th similarity
o soil here an yon but he would have
his roots fra florida twice a year for
the graftin

  i lighted my pipe and walked outside
the house to think the situation over i
was morally convinced that some rep-
tilian thing had seized me in the night
and i was more than half inclined to
believe that mr curtis had been dragged
out in the same way yet the more i
came to consider the possibility of such
a thing the less likely it seemed i heard
the sound of splashing oars and looked
upi to find ben biggoty in his skiff near-
ing the little wharf i waved my hand
at him and walked around to the front
of the house

  heahs you-alls eatins he an-
nounced and i saw that in his skiff he
had two baskets filled

  who told you to bring them ben
i asked and he stared at me

  ah brings em twict a week he
announced and lifted the baskets out

  i went out on the plank and looked
down at him

  ben i said do you know who i
am
robert shirley



  yessah yous de pussecutin lawyer
yassah he replied with a toothed grin

  then you know that if i feel like
it i can have you taken down to eliza-
beth city and locked up as a witness
dont you i went on whereupon he
turned as pale as a negro can turn

  for de lawd i aint done nothin 
he cried hones to goodness i aint

  i looked at him and sympathized with
his fright probably there was a good
reason for it there generally is with
men of bens stamp

  why are you afraid of this place
ben i asked him tell me the truth
now

  he glanced about him and dropped
his voice

  dis heahs de debbils islan suh he
said tremblingly black man aint got
no show heah debbil he ketch a niggah
heah after dahk an dat man never shows
up no moah

  what makes you say that i in-
quired

  two men has bin took dat away he
exclaimed bat minogue an hahvy
johnson come down heah an dey aint
come back no moah

  macgregor came around the corner
of the house just then and stopped when
he saw me talking to biggoty

  wi ye tak a look at th green-
house he inquired with what seemed
elaborate solicitation

  i nodded

  im coming i answered and walked
away from the negro of course i took
no stock in his statement but there was
certainly a mystery about the place
macgregor waited and as i came up to
him he turned with me i walked per-
haps a dozen paces with him and then
an idea struck me i would put this
thing to him without delay i stopped
and swung about to face him we were
standing within ten feet of the tamarack
trees-that formed the circle

  mr macgregor i said in my court-
room manner im going to ask you

some direct questions and i want direct
answers to them theres a mystery
here and it is time it was cleared up
to begin with why are you concealing
something from us why did you not
tell us frankly what was in your thoughts
last night when you heard about mr
curtis disappearance

  i misdoot ye have th right- he
began when i stopped him

  ill soon convince you of that i
replied grimly as i told you last
night i happen to be the prosecuting at-
torney for this county ill make it a
legal matter if i cant find cooperation
any other way just now it is my duty
to find out what you know to begin
with why did biggoty tell me that two
men had disappeared from this place al-
ready

  the scotchman looked at me with
startled eyes

  twa men he echoed

  yes i replied sharply i have
their names minogue and johnson
youd better tell me all you know

  he looked at me calculatingly and
seemed to weigh the matter in his mind

  mayhap i will-when im certain
meester curtis has surely gone away
fra here he replied

  do you mean to say there is a doubt
in your mind i asked with some as-
tonishment then i think i can con-
vince you that he has gone and most
unusually look up there i caught
him by the shoulder and swung him
about pointing up to where the white
shirt still fluttered in the breeze his
eyes followed my hand and i saw his
face pale suddenly it became suffused
with blood and he clapped both hands
to his head and staggered back i caught
at him but with a cry he plunged for-
ward again and fell to the ground i
stooped over him and turned him on his
back he was breathing stertorously
i knew the signs the man had suffered
a stroke of apoplexy or at least what re-
sembled one
	the long arm in the clearing

  with jims aid i got him into the
house and laid upon his bed the situa-
tion was a difficult one as there was no
medical aid within miles and no way to
send for any until biggoty should appear
again however we did what we could
for him and then retired for consulta-
tion as far as i could see the situation
had not changed we were still con-
fronted with the facts mr curtis had
disappeared i had been attacked by
some snake-like creature in his room
two colored men were reported to have
disappeared in a like manner and the
scotchman was out of the running for
the time being

  we put in the day in searching the
surrounding canebrake for possible
tracks or indications that someone might
have wandered into them and been either
attacked or overcome we found noth-
ing on our return just at dusk i se-
cured a pole and rescued the shirt it
was clean but badly torn as if it had
caught upon something and been ripped
from its wearer

  now whats to do asked jim when
we had finished supper

  im going to find out what attacked
me in that room last light i said grimly
something came in through that win-
dow and pm inclined to think it was
the same thing that attacked mr cur-
tis

  whats your idea ill help of
course said curtis

  well sit up and watch without a
light i replied if we hear anything
well flash this pocket electric torch i
brought well take a couple of shot-
guns and if there is-

  there was no need to finish the sen-
tence its import was sufficiently ob-
vious

  at eleven oclock or thereabouts we
proceeded to the bedroom where i had
slept the night before and made our-
selves as comfortable as we could under
the circumstances shotguns reposed
across our knees the lamp was placed

on the table between us with a supply
of matches and i held the electric torch
in my hand

  the hours pased and i began to
yawn there was an old-fashioned
clock in the kitchen and i heard this
strike two there was a faint breeze
blowing outside that rustled the leaves
and occasionally there was the call of a
night bird suddenly curtis touched me
on the arm

  what was that he whispered and
as i listened i heard a peculiar sound
that one might liken to a great arm
beating a heap of brushwood with a
giant rubber flail jim let go of my
arm

  its that thrashing sound i mentioned
yesterday he said its nothing i
expect

  i could hear him yawn suddenly
he closed his teeth together with a snap
and stood up

  ill go to sleep if i sit there much
longer he said im going to walk
about the room dont let that gun
drive at me like a good fellow

  he stretched himself and then moved
over toward the window i could see
his shadow dimly outlined against the
panes and there was a sound of some-
thing moving behind he stopped with
his back to the window and listened
standing quietly as he did so i caught
a glimpse of something that moved
behind him and then just the faintest
scraping sound it fascinated me and
my heart began to pound in my breast
apparently curtis did not hear it for
he made no move with an effort i
forced myself to action and bringing
the torch into play i pushed the button
instantly jim stood in a circle of bril-
liant light and he cried out as i yelled

  jump i cried and he sprang for-
ward just as a long thick snake-like
tentacle writhed above his head in the
light i could see that this tentacle had
come in through the window without
further thought than the disgust and
robert shirley



horror that possessed me i swung the
shotgun across my knees into position
dropped the torch and fired both bar-
rels there was an instants thrashing
a scraping sound and silence shaking
and trembling i picked up the torch
again and flashed its beams about the
room the place was empty

  thank god i exclaimed fervently

  what was it tom asked the shak-
ing voice of curtis from the doorway
where he stood he coughed as the
fumes of the burning powder struck
his throat and before he could answer
a quavering voice behind him broke in

  yell ha need o thanks this nicht
it said solemnly and i threw the light
from my torch upon the white and
quivering features of macgregor who
stood a phantom of fear in the passage
behind my friend

  stand aside jim i said quickly to
curtis he moved and i opened the
breech of my shotgun and shoved in a
fresh cartridge as i snapped the
weapon shut again i turned it on the
scot

  come in here i exclaimed venom-
ously theres an explanation coming
from you my friend and youd best
be swift in making it what devils
business is going on here and what was
that thing

  i expect there was something more
than mere determination in my tone
for i was so shaken with the revulsion
of feeling and the horror of the sicken-
ing thing i had seen that i doubt not
i would have driven the charge from
the shotgun into the man before me
had he given me the slightest cause

  ye may put oop yer weapon mees-
ter drake he said quaveringly step-
ping into the room with unsteady feet
curtis now applied a match to the wick
of the lamp and i could see that the
man was trembling at the knees he
sank into a chair almost as he spoke

  im no certain im doin what th
maister would hae me do in spierin to

ye what im goin tae he said but
ill ease ma conscience at ony rate

  suddenly from outside there came a
long drawn howl and this was followed
instantly by a series of agonized barks
from the dog i turned toward the win
dow but macgregor cried out

  keep awa he yelled

  i sprang back a fresh chorus of
barks and yelps broke upon the air
and followed by curtis i dashed into
the passage through the kitchen and
into the darkness outside there was a
scuffling and struggling going on near
the corner of the house and in the light
of the torch i found the dog in the
clutch of a smaller tentacle than the one
that had appeared in the room i sazv
that it led into the circle of tamarack
trees

  without thought i sprang forward
and seized the struggling dog it was
a matter of considerable difficulty to tear
him from that slimy hold but i did so
and flung him to one side still howling
horribly instantly he gained his feet
and fled in the frenzy of his fear into
the canebreak we could hear his icries
for some minutes until they died away
in the distance

  what was that thing for gods
sake what was it curtis cried to me
and i shook my head

  keep away from that clump of
trees i warned him theres some-
thing hidden there that will need in-
vestigation i think macgregor knows
even as i spoke i uttered an exclama-
tion for out of the kitchen door the
scotchman staggered and gasping fell
to the ground unable to regain his
feet he scrambled on hands and knees
toward us just then the moon broke
forth from behind a wrack of dark
clouds and shed a brilliant light upon
the scene i strode forward and caught
him by the shoulder

  whats the matter man  i cried to
him

  an ax an ax he gabbled and


the long arm in the clearing

pointed to the tamaracks through the
close circle of them i saw projecting a
white arm that moved two long min-
utes later we had dragged through a
hastily chopped orifice in the circle of
trees the naked and scarred body of
henry curtis the old man was lacer-
ated and torn and could hardly speak
we carried him very tenderly into the
kitchen and laid him on the blankets be-
fore the fire curtis had built i poured
brandy down his throat and jim chafed
him with the same fiery fluid eventu-
ally we were rewarded by seeing his
eyes open consider us gravely and then
close again while the deep breathing
told us that he slept naturally it was
then i thought of macgregor and found
him lying unconscious beside the door

  henry curtis as i had learned from
his nephew and macgregor had become
almost a fanatic on the subject of plant
breeding and super cultivation and had
concentrated his attention upon a real
or fancied relationship between plants
and animals ill leave the naturalists to
settle the widsom or folly of it in his
travels in bolivia he had come across
a giant specimen of the sundew or the
devils-tree as they call it there the
thing belongs to the mimosa family this
plant had the queer faculty of moving
certain long tentacle like leaves and it
uses these to feed itself with the insects
that settle upon it in north carolina
there is a branch of the same family
known as venus fly trap curtis had
discovered this and determined to try
an experiment following out his pet the-
ory with the carolina soil he wanted
to try the effect of certain foods upon
a plant bred from the specimens he had
procured this explained his residence
in the swamp

  macgregor and i worked over that
plant for ten years said the old man
the next day we cultivated and se-
lected and luther barbank could not
have been more patient then i tried
the experiment of feeding the plant raw

meat and it grew and thrived wonder-
fully finally we produced a really gi-
gantic specimen and i saw that it would
necessarily have to be protected fenced
so we built that tamarack hedge about
it to keep it within bounds a thing like
that spreads it grew and grew it de-
veloped into a monstrosity a veritable
bloodthirsty giant of a plant and it be-
gan to exhibit selective ability to find
its own food we began to miss the
chickens small pigs and the like and we
caught it at work the tentacles had
gftwn tremendously and were tough and
strong it was interesting to me to watch
it at work and though macgregor
warned me that it should be destroyed
i could not bring myself to do it for
my theory was being borne out in it
then macgregor went away to florida
for a few days he had been in the
habit of feeding the plant and for the
first two or three days i did it then
i became interested in a new series of
experiments in the greenhouse and i for-
got it for nearly a week four nights
ago i waked to find myself being
dragged to the window i tried to free
myself and could not instantly i knew
what had happened the starving plant
had found me and was supplying itself
with food i was dragged out through
the window and up and over the tops
of the hedge from which i fell

  the old gentleman took a sip of the
brandy and water and continued

  the fall stunned me i imagine at
any rate the thing must have made heroic
efforts to digest me but evidently it had
not yet reached the growth that would
permit that but its effluvia was anaes-
thetic in quality and it held me until
i was thrown to one side from what
you tell me the dog must have found
me or scented me lying near the edge
and in his efforts to dig me out got
caught himself then you boys rescued
me and i thank you both macgregor
here tells me you contemplated arrest-
ing him for my murder drake
a laureate



  he came as close to jail as he ever
will come and keep out of it i said
grimly by the way sir what about
those two colored boys minogue and
johnson who are said to have disap-
peared 

 the old gentleman smiled

  youll find them down at roanoke
he said i played the god from the
machine there both had scolding wives
and wanted to get away they had
worked for me and i gave them money
they rowed down the canal into the
cheasapeake and forgot to mention to
anyone where they were going they
sent me the money i lent them some
months ago

  what about that infernal devils
tree uncle asked jim youre not
going to leave it here i hope

  if you and drake will take a couple
of those dynamite cartridges youll find

in the closet in my room and plant a
little mine near the thing ill be obliged
to both of you the old man answered
with a smile its like tearing out one
of macgregors arms but it will have
to go a thing lile that is too dan-
gerous even for the great dismal
swamp

  the next day just as the dynamite
hoisted all that there was of the devils
tree into the air i heard a hysterical
bark behind me i turned and found
the dog as one of the leatherlike
tentacles fell nearby he seized it in his
teeth and shook it viciously then trotted
in and laid it at old mr curtis feet

  pete never liked that tree much
the old man said i think his mind is
relieved

  an sos mine ill hae ye knaw-
private-like yell understan remarked
macgregor grimly

a laureate

by clinton scoliard

there be many things to sing
as pass the vari-colored days-
the birds that mount on gleaming wing
the glamour of the forest ways

the sea that chants unto the shore

the rainbows radiant arc of light
the earths abundant harvest store

the red auroras of the night

yet would i not my lot bewray

but hold it very kind of fate
should sylvia smile on me and say
that i may be her laureate
carlotta advises

            by florence baier

  

the mackensie houses were the
first one passed on the road to the
country club they stood on the
crest of a long rise each in the exact cen-
tre of its thirty acres great squarely-
set houses of tawny brick with wide
eaves and deep shadowed porches a
brick wall shielded them from the road
and symmetrical drives wound across the
sloping lawns from the similar gateways
set side by side to the similar carriage-
porches at the back a tree-shaded lane
ran from the garden pergola of one to the
garden pergola of the other and a white
stile mounted the picket fence at the
boundary line but that was a later wom-
anish development with which john and
william mackensie had little to do

  for twenty years the mackensies had
but a single aim between them and that
the establishment of a wool business equal
in output and quality to the mills of their
native town in scotland they spent
their days in the clack of looms and card-
ing machines breathing an atmosphere
filled with fine floating dust and redolent
of unwashed fleeces the rest of the
time they merely ate and slept they were
short stocky men slow of speech and
movement with insignificant faces and
dull kindly eyes john was a trifle older
than william and the intruding note of
gray in his brown hair was a bit more
obvious but they had both lived so far
beyond the normal marrying years that
marriage came to them as something
more than a simple surprise

  they were very cleverly manipulated
in the matter had they but known it
from her weather-beaten cottage oppo-



site their boarding house mrs ayres had
watched with quite as single a purpose as
their own the mackensie progress from
nothing at all to riches she was a plump
widow with no income worth mentioning
and with twin girls on her hands it was
a situation in which she fully expected to
be forgiven much in spite of her handi-
cap of shabby gentility she groomed her
daughters for what she was pleased to call
their destiny and governed them shame-
lessly with a weak heart as day-pupils they
attended the most select school-taking
the same morning train as the macken-
sies but giving the brothers no attention
beyond a modest good morning on
pain of bringing on one of their mothers
attacks they took cooking lessons and
learned to make delicious scones and
they had a singing-master who made a
specialty of the old-fashioned ballad
mrs ayres was the sort who believed
that all a womans claims on life were
canceled by a nice marriage and she
achieved it triumphantly for her girls the
summer they were eighteen the dual
courtship was not exciting so fai as
camilla and carlotta were concerned
and they wrinkled their noses involun-
tarily the only time they ever mentioned
the honeymoon- but not even they had
the slightest doubts as to the propriety of
their marriages

  the nine years since had served to
prove them not only successful but almost
identical breakfast was served in the
morning and lights were turned out at
night almost to the minute in each house
camilla and carlotta ordered roast mut-
ton three times a week and laid out woolen
florence baier



underwear on the morning of the tenth
of november once a month each
household entertained at a dinner fol-
lowed by old-fashioned whist and once a
year they gave a dance jointly at the
country club camilla planned the de-
tails of these affairs but it was carlotta
who decided on the dates and grouped
the guests to be sure camillas baby
died at eight days and carlottas lived to
eight years and gave promise of her
mothers loveliness but that was hardly
a recognizable difference it was not un-
til cedric dewing had begun to walk
with her up and down the tree-shaded
lane day after day that camilla felt she
was experiencing something in which
carlotta did not share

  it was not a thing that had come sud-
denly for at least two years before the
reviews began to speak enthusiastically
of his promise cedric had been a fre-
quenter of the smart little country club
on the high road occasionally he
brought a chum down from the city to
make up a foursome of golf occasional-
ly they spent a rainy afternoon in one or
the other of the mackensie living-rooms
at music or bridge or the four met
rather casually for a matinee in town

  it was not until the third summer that
a perceptible rift appeared and ca-
milla and cedric took to walking in the
lane they were nearly the same age
and had grown conscious of it as if they
were the younger members of a family
and were subtly united by their common
impulses and ideas the recklessness
that john forbade the wild spirits that
perplexed him cedric accepted as the
natural expression of camillas self the
smallest incidents served to enhance their
happiness he seemed to bring her out
of his insatiate love of life the fulness of
her own unlived youth the pulsing joy
that had evaded her she had a restless
unconscious yearning for life lived to its
full and cedrics companionship gave
her a curiously satisfying understanding
of what life might mean after ill she

was less than twenty-seven she bloomed
as a plant grown in the shadow flowers
under the sun into the laughter that she
shared with him there poured the mans
own pagan love of life of the blue sky
and the great white clouds and the scents
and sounds of summer but through
their laughter camilla was aware of a
mystery which she half understood and
after which she wanted to seek the
time came when she was conscious of a
delicious inward throbbing at the sight of
his face and of the dark eyes into which
she could not look straightforwardly
and then-the time came when their
easy friendliness crashed down about
them and they were left clinging to each
other in its ruins terrified at the inten-
sity of love

  three times in as many hours camilla
put out the clothes that she would take on
such a trip already she had packed her
bag with her characteristic consideration
for such practical details as the weight of
brushes and the certainty that her tiny
case of remedies was filled but two
great boxes still yawned on the floor be-
side the bed on which she spread her
array of garments some of them were
old favorites soft vivid gowns such as
cedric liked and some of them the
smart traveling suit the shimmering
silken lingerie were new bought in the
last unhappy week when the intense ab-
sorption she gave to clothes had served to
still her agonies of indecision she
sorted and arranged the piles exactly in
the order in which she would pack them
but she did not pack them instead she
caught up a wide shade hat and went out

  she had it vaguely in mind to go tj
carlotta whom she had been avoiding for
days but when she reached the foolish
little stile at the boundary line between
their meadows she saw cedric coming
toward her she realized with a shock
that it was he rather than carlotta
whom she had been seeking that it was
for him she had chosen the white gown


carlotta advises

she was wearing and the hat lined with a
rose-color that gave a warm glow to her
clearv creamy skin she stood quite still
watching as he came toward her for his
quick smile and the glow of pleasure flar-
ing in his narrow deeply-set eyes like a
dull flame in the depths of a cave all
day she had been longing for the inex-
plicable joy his nearness brought her
now that he was there she felt herself
trembling with the impact of his presence
it was cedric who spoke first

  camilla youre as white as your own
dear ghost youre not ill

  no i just didnt sleep last night nor
the night before

  i know his eyes changed clouding
a moment he reached down and slipped
his hand over hers to-night ends it
thank god

to-night begins it she said very low
taking her elbows in his firm hands
he drew her toward him she could see
that kis lips were quivering but he smiled
down at her before he spoke

  you cant stifle love dear he said
love means life and sacrifice of love
is the first of the great sins against life
you know you love me

  oh i do cedric i do she drew
back and looked at him with sombre
eyes its just that im not the kind of
woman to play the part you are giving
me i-i dread all the chances accumu-
lating against me i-all my people have
been good-my mother my cousins-in
the conventional sense proper and nar-
row if you like but good its i who am
strange to myself i-didnt know i
should be like this it-it has all come so
quickly i cant help thinking of car-
lotta

  carlotta

  she nodded her face averted
carlotta is so keen she said shes
always been a balance wheel for me
camilla-he swung about and
gripped her arm so tightly that it hurt
her-promise youll not tell carlotta
promise me

  she looked up amazed at the hostility
in his tone but i thought you liked
carlotta

  oh i do but this is between us-
you and me there is no one else in the
world that could understand what it means
were starting out new with just our-
selves and our lives before us

  there was a boyish wistfulness in his
voice as if he were trying in common-
place words to tell her the many ways he
loved her but the portent of what he was
saying stilled her for an instant the
thought of going away with him had been
dominant for days whatever she had
been doing or saying she had been con-
scious of that as she would have been
conscious of a neuralgic pain at her tem-
ples there were times when she was
certain that it was the only way of escape
into life that not to go away with cedric
would be an irreparable calamity and
there were other times when it seemed
weakness and she could smile at her own
folly

  i have everything planned she began
quietly theres a boy coming for my
boxes i decided not to take a trunk
hell bring them to you late this after-
noon

  im going up to town in time for
dinner she heard his quick intake of
breath and there came a pause that
seemed to carry them on irresistibly
camilla hadnt you-wouldnt it be
wiser for you to come with me  on the
early train

  she shook her head answering his
perplexed look with a still more decided
negative she knew that the delay of an
hour increased the danger of discovery
that if john were at home it would re-
quire all her wit to evade his questions
and get away

  the boat sails at ten cedric per-
sisted it makes a short evening any
way and weve dined together often
enough this last year

  its not that im not afraid of being
seen with you
florence baier



    then why he asked insistently

    its carlotta i want to see car-
  lotta

    desperately she had given him the
  simple truth behind everything she
  was aware of her sister as she might be
  aware of an idea strangely personal to
  herself she had established a more es-
  sential communion with carlotta than
  with anyone alive and at the parting
  every fibre of her being cried out for
  some last contact

    but i will not tell her she added
  as she saw the stern line about the mans
  mouth i promise you that i wont tell
  her cedric

    they were close to her own door and
  he followed her into the dim hall the
  silence into which her promise had fallen
  grew deep and intense through her
  half-veiled eyes she saw his profile
  brown and boyish and the curves of his
  face and shoulder motionless in that
  moment of tense quiet almost against
  her will she swayed toward him and
  found herself imprisoned in his arms
  his lips hot and eager fell on her face
  and throat she drank in the poignant
  rapture of his caresses giving him back
  kiss for kiss when his lips sought hers
  her very blood seemed to bubble with
  joy even when she had let him go and
  stood for a moment leaning against the
  door that she had just closed behind him
   a triumphant happiness filled her drove
  all doubts away

    upstairs she found carlotta in her
  room she was standing beside the lit-
  tered bed examining a frock flung across
  its foot they were very like they had
  the same creamy skin and pointed chin
  the same brown hair that showed coppery
  threads in sunlight the same long flexible
  hands camilla was easily the more
  beautiful but carlotta had a sparkling
  charm that gave her piquancy they
  smiled at each other good-humoredly

   what does it all mean carlotta
 asked are you cleaning house

    i-im sending some things back to

the dressmaker a boy is coming for the
boxes in half an hour

  wheres lizette

  im going to pack these myself have
you been in all the afternoon 

  no ive been walking carlotta
yawned and glanced at her watch
archie carstyle was with me

  camilla hardly heard what carlotta
said her happiness ebbed a little
thought followed thought in an instan-
taneous succession contradicting refut-
ing one another as her hands folded
and packed it seemed to her that her old
life was running out like the last strag-
gling sands in a glass cedric had said
that love meant life and she knew that
it was true all the years that she had
been john mackensies wife had been as
if she had not lived at all she wanted
to live ardently to the furthest reach of
feeling that was to be in the years to
come cedric was offering her his
strange sweet love and presently with
the gift life would be made over

  youve had that gown for ages car-
lottas cool voice came to her youre
sending that back to the dressmakers
it needs-refitting her hands fal-
tered she looked up to see that carlotta
was searching her face with wide startled
eyes

  milla she said are you running
away with cedric dewing is that it
something within camilla gave way
like the breaking of a taut cord her
hands shook a little as she smoothed out
the gown

  whats the use of lying milla of
course im surprised ive always
thought your sense of convention was
so obdurate that fear alone would keep
you safe its rather odd-

  what would you do camilla inter-
rupted what would you do in my
place you know better than anyone
what a poor business life has been
but youve made it do havent you
until you met cedric dewing you made
it do just as i have


carlotta advises

  i havent anything camilla flung at
her and was amazed at the wave of color
that surged up her sisters throat it
was dull before then cedrics coming
made it-ugly oh i hadnt meant to
tell you theres no use and i prom-
ised cedric she flung out her arms
half despairingly and crossed the room
looking back she saw carlotta sitting
quietly her chin propped on her hands
in an attitude as unstudied as a mans

  i suppose cedric means to do the
decent thing by you she said once
john gets his divorce

  camilla winced a little at the word it
was the first time she had allowed it to
enter her thoughts and while she ad-
mitted it she found herself hating it

  i suppose john will divorce me she
said slowly just now-nothing mat-
ters except that id be free

  john will divorce you carlotta ob-
served coolly once youre gone you
never can come back he isnt the sort
to welcome a magdalen nor william
either what will you do with life ca-
milla 

 how do i know how does anyone
know  you cant think of life tout dune
piece

  you can consider the possible re-
sults carlotta said sharply youve
plans havent you youll have to talk
fast milla im leaving at six

  six then i could catch the early
train and have dinner with cedric
would he be expecting you

  i was to meet him at the boat  thats
where im sending the boxes the boats
sailing at ten-for south america well
spend the winter in montevideo i think
cedric wants to finish his new book by
spring then on-japan india-

  you cant travel forever

  well settle down after a year or so
paris perhaps cedric does his best
work in a crowd

  of course you know youre making
a fool of yourself carlotta said with
less cruelty than sheer thoughtfulness

for a moment she sat turning the matter
over in her mind camilla felt no resent-
ment the understanding between them
was too cpmplete for that after a little
carlotta began to speak almost tone-
lessly the breaks and pauses between her
words more emphatic than the things
she said it was carlottas way she
looked at everything from every imagin-
able angle

  whatever turn life takes and youre
not one to divine lifes turns the things
likely to be disastrous you rarely hear
of a liaison lasting over six months and
it will take that to get a divorce cedrics
likely never to marry you-well suppose
he doesnt youll be wandering out-
laws in the very places where your out-
lawry is most easily understood those
big hotels cairo paris london have
the same sophisticated sharp-eyed people
in them and theyve the same sugges-
tion of our social order visiting lists
and caste and doucet gowns and fri-
day fasts women like you whove de-
fied the same rules will recognize you
and theyll claim you too in a sort of
unconventional sisterhood youll hate
it respectability is the one thing women
such as you and i care about itll be-
come so precious in a year or two that
youll steal chances at just looking re-
spectable  cedrics sacrificing a
good deal the thing is likely to inter-
fere with his success hell come to see
that whatever your relation it cant be
conventional or normal there is always
the past and even if you marry each
other it will look as if you were afraid
hed escape- you are so abnormally ex-
posed to each other john and william
have rather the habit of regarding
us among the furniture cedric wont
youll feel that hes aware of you every
moment the time will come when you
will be afraid to talk and afraid not to
because you have no reason for avoiding
it the little things that protect married
people from each other-children duties
visits new maids bores-you wont have
florence baier



youve cut yourself off its hard on
human nerves-that sort of thing i
wonder youve the courage to chance it

  camilla did not answer she rose and
sent down the boxes by the maid who
came in answer to her ring when they
had gone carlotta shrugged her shoul-
ders with an air of accepting the inevit-
able and moved toward the half-open
door her voice was quite casual

  well probably regret this afternoon
all our lives she said im sorry i
havent persuaded you but theres no
use going over it shall-shall you
leave a note for john

  camilla shook her head

  why should i  ive nothing to say

  no-for all the lightness of her
voice carlottas lips quivered a little as
they touched camillas-theres nothing
to say shall i take your bag it might
make it easier for you to slip out without
it

  camilla stood at the window watching
carlotta as she went down the drive it
seemed odd that she did not go through
the lane as usual and the sight of her
carrying the bag was almost too much
for camilla would carlotta try even
now to delay her or prevent her going
would shego to john or william the
house was very still the clock ticked
off the minutes and the things that car-
lotta had said ran through her mind in
rhythm with its ticking the agonies of
indecision flooded back upon her was
it true that she could never be happy
was the brief rapture of love worth the
sacrifice that she would be called upon to
make for it only an hour remained
between her and the moment when she
would be getting into the train after
that the thing became irrevocable

  she ate her dinner early done in the
dining-room and quite without tasting
it when the clock pointed to half-after
eight she put on her hat and went down-
stairs in the dim vestibule where cedric
had kissed her she gave a quick gasp
and stood still john mackensie was

standing in the open door which he had
just unlocked

  i-i am going over to carlottas
she explained

  carlottas he looked at her stu-
pidly and from her to the figure of
a messenger boy scudding down the drive
on his wheel carlotta isnt home she
sent you this from the city he held out
to her a square creamy envelope with
her name across it in carlottas dashing
angular writing-

  she took it with a sense of abject de-
spondency waiting until her husband had
gone on into the lighted dining-room and
she had heard the scrape of his chair at
the table before she opened it it began
abruptly

  you should receive this just as you are
starting for the station and having received
it you will not go between us we should
have made a clever woman camilla and a
courageous one i seemed to have reached the
limit of endurance this afternoon and i could
see no way out it was your plan of escape
clear definite detailed that set me to thinking
i could never plan like that this is a shabby
trick i am playing you-

  it is i who am going away i piled up the
chances of misery while i was talking to you
and for all that they are there im going to
risk it i am writing this from the restaurant
where we are dining i have been very sure
 for a long time that archie cared about me-
and it was your escape-or mine

  i know that i am cutting the ground from
under your feet i imagine youll have a tre-
mendous throw-back into conventionality when
you realize what i have done i am quite sure
you will not follow me one sister gone is a
tragedy but two you yourself can see the
farce a second elopement would be and
neither you nor cedric could endure a lifetime
of farce i think perhaps you will suffer
horribly for a little dear and i am sorry
but as i said it was your escape into life-or
mine the whole thing depended on which of
us acted first	v

carlotta

  p s im taking your bag it was all so
nicely packed and when i am on board i
shall ask cedric for the boxes i have taken
nothing and your gowns will be lovely for me

  through a blinding mist camilla
twisted the letter slowly into a taper and
burning it dropped the blackened wisp
into the grate whichever way she turned
an ironical complication confronted

her she had the sense of having walked
into the trap of some gigantic practical
joke she turned passionately heartsick
at the though of cedric but she knew
that carlotta had written the truth even
if he should come back she would never
have the courage to receive him this
was the end she shivered a little as she
told herself that she was already old her
emotions burned out her life gone by un-
lived presently she became aware that
here too a clock was ticking in the rooms
stillness and through it she heard the
far-off rush and rumble of the train she
was to have taken what seemed like a
long time passed and she stood motion-
less thinking not at all then suddenly
she remembered william

  who would tell william  she thought
of his austere face with its stiff graying
hair and its dull kindly eyes and saw it
stricken as it would be when he knew
what carlotta had done she had never
doubted williams love for carlotta it
echoed in the sound of his rough wee in
his awkward slow tendernesses a deep
unworded pride in and love for all that
made carlotta lovely the ruin that she
had brought upon him upon them all be-
came bitterly clear in the face of that
for a moment she hated carlotta

  the next she was plunged into self-
loathing it was she who had planned
the wrong that carlotta had accomplished
she was not guiltless she had given the
other woman a weapon with which to
strike and wound had not carlotta said
that she would never had laid such plans 
if john had cared for her as william
cared for carlotta-

  she could hear him coming along the
hall and saw his stocky figure outlined
between the portieres as he searched the
darkened room for her she stood up
her knees trembling he came to her
gave her a fleeting kiss on the corner of
her mouth and drew her down comfort-
ably beside him within the circle of his
arm

  had a happy day lassie  he asked as
he had asked for nine years when she
broke into a wild sobbing he held her off
bewildered carlotta he said again
shes in town i tell ye she came to
the factory just at closing and dragged
william down for dinner at a fancy
restaurant theyre staying in for a the-
atre theyll be down at midnight but
by the lord i wasnt to tell ye till past
ten oclock aweel sax minutes one way
or another- have ye the paper ca-

 you softly came and uttered not a word

      but shyly placed your gentle hand in mine

 a rapture that was agony divine

 though i had sinned you gave your lips to me
 you let me find a solace in your eyes

 and in your tears an unshed mystery

              the secret city

painting a midget with a highly
elaborated mountain as a back-
ground is scarcely fair to the midg-
et it could not be blamed for complain-
ing of the artists judgment of relative
values it is very nice for the mountain
but the bit of a thing standing as the
central figure has a sorry enough time

  indeed it is hardly fair to the artist
his background overwhelms him rises
portentous and awful and the midget
for which after all the picture was
painted is lost in the confusion of dis-
jointed proportions

  hugh walpole in the secret city
george h doran company  has
told a third-rate story against a first-rate
background the setting for his latest
novel is nothing less than the russian
revolution but the story is merely the
everlasting triangle with a sort of fourth
side dragged in for good measure mr
walpole assumes to know russians
that is to say he must be a sort of
demigod shining like the angels to
know the russian is to grasp the scope
of human passions as dominating men
and women and directed by the irrespon-
sible whim of children mr walpole
says he has sensed all of this and he pro-
ceeds to exhibit men and women who
do not differ as far as can be judged at
this distance from the men andwomen
the best known russian writers have cre-
ated hence they must be true

  as hinted the story is slim enough and
as to the accuracy of his picture of the
revolution one can only guess accurate
or not it reads well and the arrangement
induces a dramatic tension

  it is interesting to note that mr wal-
pole has sounded the first indication that
the french revolution for purposes of
fiction is henceforth passe however
the similarity of the two mighty events
has already been so strenuously noted
that the reader will not be at all confused
by the fiction dealing with the russian
upheaval the book is worth reading as
an indication of what one may expect
in addition to the fact that it is in itself
a creditable work

  marie corelli is still writing you may
not believe it but assuredly it is true
age seems not to have given hesitation
to her pen naturally it is not surpris-
ing that she is turning to the question of
rejuvenation her latest offering the
young diana george h doran
 in no sense a novel deals with
the acquisition of beauty and youth by a
homely spinster surely the book shows
miss corelli at her worst it lacks plot
ingenuity care in construction human
sympathy understanding ideals inter-
est originality outside of these trifling
defects it may be a great work

the flail by newton fuessle moffat
  yard  company  analyzes the
  psychology of an american born ger-
  man boy before and during the war
  take the first two books that is the
  first two hundred pages throw them
  away and give the last t-wo books your
  attention and you will have a rather
  good picture of the ambitious german-
  american caught in the throes of the
  great conflict

the bloom in the leaves

   is a foolish attempt at western
  romance that there never were such
  people and never was such a life mat-
  ters little to mr jackson nor would
  it matter to his readers had he made
  the highly impossible seem probable
  he doesnt the excessively credulous
  may find it interesting but the mildly
  initiated will be bored

once on a summer range by francis
 hill the macmillan company
  is of the same kidney as mr
 jacksons book it is also an effort at
 western romance but the events are
 thrown into a highly impossibly set-
 ting and the characters are neither
 interesting nor true

the man nobody knew by holworthy
 hall doubleday page  company
  is a war novel now happily
 growing scarce one doesnt quarrel
 with authors who create men and wom-
 en different from any men and women
 who ever lived but one is justified in
 being disgruntled if the writer fails to

  make his characters convincing air
  hall unhappily is of this number his
  remade man is a creature that never
  was on sea or land and his secret is for-
  ever quite safe as no one could have
  any interest in discovering it or prop-
  agating it

  frank dilnot says some condescend-
ingly nice things about america in his

is just barely readable

an american poilu little brown 
  company  is an anonymous
  war offering consisting of letters sup-
  posed to have been written by an
  american enlisted in the french
  army after reading the book one
  can scarce blame the writer for keep-

  weakly sentimental and deals almost

the bloom in the leaves

by aloysius coll

my love was like the feathery mist
of green upon the spring-

the little leaves that catch the dew

              and make the birds to sing

laughter and tears upon my soul

               as little leaves are spun
               around the giant oak to catch
               the dewdrop and the sun

but o his love the thundering rain
that drenches bough and root

               swept through the timorous little leaves

little fables of inconsistency

wherein is shown that the wise saws are
generally equipped with cross-cut teeth

love laughs at locksmiths but-

nce upon a time before the high cost of living raised its hydra-headed
menace in the land there lived a youth and a maiden named respectively jack
and jill in the theatre of life they listened to the clever patter of the little vaude-
villain billed as love and fell for his stuff so they were married and all was as
merry as the wedding bells until one day poverty came in at the door the door
was locked but that made no difference to poverty he came in just the same
by way of a joke love jumped through the window poverty took possession of
the spare room and proceeded to make himself at home

    jack and jill phoned for the locksmith to come and repair the damage the
locksmith came with his kit of tools but catching a glimpse of poverty in the
spare room demanded his pay in advance whereupon love stuck his head in the
window and burst into roars of laughter

    ha ha ha ho ho ho cried love if theres anybody that can get a
laugh out of me its a locksmith hes funnier than i am

    jack and jill were overjoyed to see the locksmith slink away nor did they know
he had merely gone to fetch his gang but that is just what the miserable gangster
did presently he returned reinforced by the butcher the baker and the candle-
stick maker all armed with cruel weapons known as bills using these horrible
instruments of torture to extract their nefarious toll from jack and jill they beat
love to an unrecognizable pulp while poverty stood outside to stall off any possible
police interference thus making the world safe for democracy then they all went
away to report to their master the high cost of living making the well-known
welkin ring with the peals of raucous mirth

moral

    love laughs at locksmiths but-he laughs best who laughs last

the lure of the unattainable is what makes life worth while after a mans
search is rewarded by finding the ideal woman she passes him up because she is
looking for the ideal man

                                                        

rfhere is nothing so beautiful as sympathy a woman always feels sorry for a
man who has trouble with his wife unless she happens to be his wife




the silver lining

signs of the times

fthese are the erstwhile gladsome days
when real beer came in kegs

when poets sang their summer lays

                       and hens laid priceless eggs

                    but now alas the demon rum
                    has sadly slipped a cog

                    one swan song then he must succumb
                    to temperance egg-nog

                       with founts of inspiration dry

                        drab days all look alike

                      the very hens but justify
                      a sympathetic strike

wise saws and modern applications

a n ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure if there were no marriages

    there would be no divorces

    sweet are the uses of adversity but adversity like olives may be an acquired
taste

    happiness comes from mating with our opposites but did you ever hear of a
beardless youth marrying a girl with a hare lip

    all the worlds a stage but dont try to be the whole show

    consistency is a jewel with which beauty is content to be unadorned

    men are but children of a larger growth when our parents cease spanking us
experience begins

    a soft answer turneth away wrath but that is no reason why you shouldnt
take boxing lessons

    virtue is its own reward and most of us go through life unrewarded

 love is blind it causes two people to think almost as much of each other as
they do of themselves

there is nothing new under the sun even our mistakes have been made before

    it is possible to reach a plans heart through his stomach but that sort of man
would rather lost his heart than his appetite

of two evils

oeing a coward myself i am an ardent hero worshiper the golden chevrons
on a soldiers sleeve intoxicate me with adulation an aviator thrills me with
bliss a man who can nonchalantly go to a dentist commands my admiration even
a married marl-inspires my respect

    consequently when the circus manager volunteered to conduct me through his
realms of romance and mystery my love of heroic deeds prompted me to accept
first he pointed out his celebrities

    there is signor scario my lion tamer he announced

    i regret to say that signor scario scarcely looked the part he seemed decidedly
anemic still you never can tell i mused he must be possessed of great
courage

    to-night he has decided to sleep in the cage with his lions said my host
    ah what a brave man i exclaimed

    oh i dont know replied the circus manager he has had a scrap with
his wife and hes afraid to go home

    well it just spoiled my whole day


the silver lining

sonnets of the commonplace

to-day the golden sun sank in the west

and as i watched its mellow afterglow

and saw the changing colors come and go

by vagrant cloudlets kissed and een caressed
unbidden tears came to my eyes distressed

                  and caused my memory to overflow
                  with ever present dreams and in my woe
                  i cursed the sun in very wretchedness

for in the west the world seemed turned to red

and then a smear of yellow overcast
the sky and as the color quickly spread

brought visions of my early morns repast

and all the scene recalled as from the dead

the weary egg with which i broke my fast

from the dictionary of experience-

juck-the religion of fools

    flattery-praise of other people

    past-the graveyard of buried hopes

    future-the millennium of resurrected dreams

    hope-breaking a pair to draw a flush

    temptation-that which a person never puts off till to-morrow

    leisure-a life sentence for those who marry in haste

    age-that for which we have little respect unless it is bottled

    genius-a person who can make you believe that he or she is smarter than
you are

    adaptability-an admirable quality possessed by a few people who can even
get used to being married

    wedlock-a tie that enables a woman to be miserable with one man rather
than to be happy with another

a spectacle to make the gods laugh is a married man and an old bachelor
    pitying each other

tiscipline is a thorn in the flesh of education a girl can always learn to
    love a man if he makes the lessons easy enough

 among the musical plays of the
 season the royal vagabond
must rnk well in the front line
if only because of the workman-like job
which george m cohan has done with
an od-fashioned opera comique in the
early stages jhis musical entertainment
apparently was a hopeless mass of an-
cient humor silly lines and lugubrious
plot in the hinterland when first pro-
duced and where the name of cohan is
an open sesame to every pocketbook au-
diences walked out on it and the critics
damned with faint praise i am willing
to admit that after witnessing the
opening down in baltimore i was thor-
oughly convinced that the royal vaga-
bond henceforth should be known as
the royal bloomer without doubt
it was the most tiresome musical concoc-
tion through which i had ever sat

  this same entertainment is now num-
bered and quite rightly among the most
successful stage pieces in new york
for the royal vagabond on view at
the cohan and harris theatre contains
about all of the ingredients necessary to
find favor with the most discriminating
playgoer how george m cohan has
done it i do not know but that hehas
done it i am positive for i have seen
the piece both before and after if ever
bricks were made without straw it has
been done in this instance

  the program states that the royal
vagabond is a cohanized opera com-
ique which means i take it that its
sponsor has satirized an old-fashioned
libretto the result is an entertainment
of real humor insinuating melodies and

a setting worthy of the follies and the
winter garden without a doubt the
royal vagabond is the best dressed
show that cohan and harris have ever
put out

  the opening ensemble with its explan-
atory solos and choruses gives at once
the keynote to the entertainment here
are the merry villagers who sing of
opera comic opera and here are
chef check the inn-keeper who tells in
song of his pretty daughter and marcel
the barber who has an eye on the pretty
daughter and a mortgage on her fathers
inn of course the pretty daughter
anitza doesnt love marcel and of
course marcel threatens to foreclose the
mortgage unless anitza becomes his
bride-all old stuff old situations but
treated humorously-cohanized too the
soldiers chorus with the four prancing
dancing soldiers is an inspiration im
agine with the stage full of a cheering
populace singing here comes the sol-
diers there appears on the scene an
army of exactly four men and they ap-
parently followers of st vitus

  anitza refuses to marry marcel be-
cause she is in love with a revolutionist
who i believe is called franz the
name is not on the program and various
persons on the stage pronounce it dif-
ferently so that it may be fernand
when her father tries to compel her to
wed the barber anitza hurries to the
royal palace where she implores the
queen mother to save her from a love-
less union but the queen has troubles
of her own for her son prince stephen
insists that he is in no great hurry to




the mummers world

marry the princess helena so that when
anitza appears upon the scene the
queen thinks she cannot do better than
obey her father which moves anitza
to speak to prince stephen and she finds
the prince very like her lover franz of
course stephen and franz are one and
the same and when a revolution is under
way and ultimately succeeds the future
king of bargravia becomes the countrys
first president and with the bars of caste
down weds mistress anitza

  there is a goodly measure of charm
about this concoction but it is the satire
rather than anything else that makes
the royal vagabond the healthy suc-
cess it is only those who have seen
the two versions of this musical piece can
realize and appreciate what mr cohan
has done with an old-fashioned skeleton

  much of the music is lovely my pref-
erence being for where the cherry
blossoms fall and love of mine
these two numbers with a stirring
march song democracy are the work
of dr anselm goetzl mr cohan him-
self has supplied a brace of hints in
good-by bafgravia and in a king-
dom of our own the last winning
countless encores through the introduc-
tion of some very attractive children
hskilfully drilled charming is a pretty
number by joseph mccarthy and harry
tierney and lastly sir arthur sullivan
is resurrected for the flowers that
bloom in the spring

  this gem from the mikado is sung
bv robinson newbold who incidentally
must be credited with the individual hit
of the evening mr newbold whose bid
to fame hitherto has been his resemblance
to raymond hitchcock now comes for-
ward as a successful comedian on his
own his humor is legitimate and it may
safely be said he has arrived opposite
him in many of the scenes appears fran-
ces demarest as the first lady of the
bath miss demarest is as handsome as
ever and acquits herself with credit
throughout the performance

  the dual role of the prince and revolu-
tionist is played by frederic santley a
brother of the more famous joseph and
while mr santley is an improvement
over his predecessor the thought is there
that he is a trifle plump for a romantic
role he looks better as the prince than
he does as the revolutionist tessa kosta
is pleasing as anitza singing and look-
ing well throughout winifred harris is
every inch a queen in her long trailing
gowns and grace fisher is a lovely
princess helena whom the prince re-
fused-probably because he heard her
sing john goldsworthy besides know-
ing how to read lines makes a handsome
colonel petroff and loui simon scores
second comedy honors as janku an
apothecary

  as in all cohan shows dancing be-
comes an important part of the royal
vagabond and from the soldiers
chorus to the featured principals there
is much excellent dancing dorothy
dickson who seems to be the legitimate
successor to mrs castle has a little girl
air and a charming trick of lifting one
shoulder which should assure her suc-
cess even were she a less gifted danseuse
i think i like miss dickson the best of
present day dancers with carl hyson
her partner off-stage as well as on she
gives an exhibition of some grotesque
stepping which in the vernacular was a
riot another charming dancer was
mary eaton a pretty blonde who seemed
as light as thistledown then there were
gladys zell and edna pierre who at-
tempted more syncopated measures with
mr santley and mr robinson

  the three acts are beautifully staged
and the costuming is charming yet every-
thing is in good taste a thing of brains
as well as money deservedly so the
royal vagabond is the most successful
musical entertainment in new york

  another excellent and successful mu-
sical piece is on view at the shubert the-
atre good morning judge built from
the pinero farce the magistrate this
w carey wonderly



divertisement is now in its second year
at the adelphi theatre london where
it is running under the name of the
boy with such a basis for its plot it
would seem that the entertainment
couldnt possibly go wrong and for once
the rule holds good we are provided
with an evenings pleasant pastime

  the plot while not remarkable for its
freshness is undeniably funny m-illi-
cent cavanaugh a widow with one son
has married horatio meebles chief ma-
gistrate of the bromley street police
court since her age is a delicate subject
with the lady she has calmly struck off
five or six years though this has proved
to be something in the nature of a boom-
erang since it keeps hug hie the son in
eton jackets and makes him out to be
fifteen years old instead of twenty-and
hughie doesnt feel fifteen years old at
the parties he kisses all the pretty girls
because hughie s just a boy like-
wise he has fallen in love with his music
mistress a most delectable young person
known as joy hitghie and joy furnish
the subject for the motif of the musical
score an arresting little number named
i am so young and you are so beau-
tiful

  but news reaches mrs meebles of the
arrival in london of colonel bagot from
bengal the colonel is hughies god-
father and knows to the day the date of
hughies birth mr meebles has in-
vited colonel bagot to dine with them
the next evening and mrs meebles
trembles for the result after her guests
have gone she prevails upon her sister
to accompany her to the colonels hotel
where she will explain the defect in her
sons age and trust to bagots honor
but before mrs meebles and her sister
diayia can get away master hughie ap-
pears upon the scene not in eton jacket
but in evening clothes and he inveigles
mr meebles into going with him to a
masquerade supper dance at the cosmos
hotel mr meebles sorely tempted
falls and sets out with his stepson

-l s

  the second act at the cosmos hotel
introduces hughie and mr meebles at
table with some pretty girls when we
consider that hughie is so young it
must be admitted that he is a very fair
picker and thoroughly familiar with the
night life of london joy turns up at
the cosmos and also colonel bagot of
course then come mrs meebles and
diana who have followed the colonel
there after some narrow escapes and
when the entire cast is assembled within
the walls of the hotel a raid occurs
policemens whistles are heard there is
the flash of lanterns the lights are ex-
tinguished and the proprietor begs every-
one to hide there is a really funny
scene in which mr meebles and mrs
meebles hide under the same table in the
dark without one knowing who the other
is but the police are coming upstairs
and hughie feeling his responsibility
comes for mr meebles and helps him to
escape over the skylights the others
are not so successful and mrs meebles
and diana colonel bagot and dianas
fiance are arrested and taken to the
bromley street police court

  here magistrate meebles shows up
the next morning much the worse for
his night at the cosmos he has no
mind to be troubled by anything or any-
body when he is told there are two
women outside who have been taken in
a raid mr meebles sentences them to
six days in the workhouse in vain the
chief clerk and the sergeant try to reason
with mr meebles they implore him to
see the ladies before passing sentence
but mr meebles is the victim of the
morning after and the ladies fall under
his displeasure he orders them to the
workhouse and then goes home

  of course the ladies are none other
than mrs meebles and diana a fact
which the chief clerk knew but the magis-
trate didnt so the clerk instead of
obeying mr meebles appeals to his su-
perior the chief magistrate one mr
burridge who sends the ladies home


the mummers world

  back home there is an unpleasant mo-
ment and then it is seen that everybody
has so much on everybody else that the
best way out is to forget and forgive
hughie is permitted to grow up and
discard his eton clothes and it is pre-
sumed he marries joy mr meebles
finds mrs meebles just as fascinating
at thirty-six as she was at one-and-thirty
diana goes to her lovers embrace

  first honors go to george hassell for
his really splendid work as horatio
meebles his makeup is a triumph he
has never been seen to better advantage
and like a true artist he never misses a
point the part of hughie cavanagh is
not especially easy to cast since the actor
has to possess a semblance of youth and
at the same time have the experience in
playing to save the role from the risque
it would be easy to roughen up hughie
and at the same time there must be a
strong temptation to do that very thing
to his credit be it-said charles king
gives a clean performance

  his sister mollie king a lovely blonde
plays the part of joy the music mistress
and with charles sings the famous i am
so young and you are so beautiful
fortunately neither of them boasts of
being a vocalist miss king gives her
usual imitations although it seems as if
eleven oclock were a little late for im-
pressions of miss barrymore and eddie
foy however well done

  an excellent performance is that given
by margaret dale as mrs meebles
while other well known players include
cyril chadwick shep camp edward
martindel and grace daniels the
chorus is especially decorative with a
pair of splendid dancers in cunningham
and clements

 next to the young and beautiful
duet the most striking number in the en-
tertainment is a captivating thing known
as swinging doors which surely will
find its way to the dance orchestras and
phonograph records dinky doddle
dicky is another tuneful melody while

sporty boys pleases doubly because of
george hassells invaluable aid

  taken on the whole good morning
judge is one of the best examples of
musical comedy on broadway with much
clean fun tinkling music and pretty
girls

  the new winter garden show monte
cristo jr is to my mind the best en-
tertainment ever offered at the country-
famous resort of the tired business
man there are those who will miss a
jolson perhaps but in the current ex-
travaganza will be found several come-
dians who do not work in vain and on
the whole monte cristo jr boasts
more zip than the jolson show sin-
bad likewise it is the best dressed
show in new york and with a cast that
sounds like a benefit performance 

  there is a real idea back of this new
extravaganza wherein the characters
from the present day are transferred back
to the time of ancient rome a clever
conceit is the introduction of the char-
acters from dumas romance in which
mercedes fernand danglers madame
caderouse haydee and edmund dantes
appear to step from the pages of a huge
book and walk off the stage we are
shown the harbor of marseilles the is-
land of monte cristo and the carnival
at rome-each a gorgeous stage picture
peopled with colorful characters

  in the vernacular there is something
doing from the first curtain an ex-
cellent comedy bit is contributed by tom
lewis who plays the part of a crook who
will lift anything from a pocketbook
to a slfe the plot concerns the love
affairs of a group of modern mortals
the poor young monte falling a victim to
the charms of mercedes mercedes is
enacted by audrey maple so that
montes infatuation is understood but
the ladys friends and relatives seek to
break off the attachment between mer-
cedes and monte with the result that
monte falls asleep and dreams himself
and his companions back in the days of
w carey wonderly



edmund dantes here he accumulates
great wealth and discovers the falseness
of mercedes so that at the final curtain
we find our hero paired off with the
faithful haydee while mercedes seeks
life happiness with another man it is
probably the first time in the history
of the theatre that the blonde turns out
to be the adventuress and the brunette
lady gets the hero comparisons of
course are odious but miss maple is a
pretty young woman though it is true
that we are given an opportunity of see-
ing more of flore revalles

  charles purcell plays monte cristo
jr and achieves very satisfactory re-
sults herein he is seen to better ad-
vantage than he was earlier in the sea-
son in the melting of molly but
then molly was a womans play and
since it gave isabel lowe such splendid
opportunities we mustnt cavil purcell
has a pleasing personality and a good
voice which is heard to fine results in
broadway butterfly and mr monte
cristo the latter the song-hit of the
piece

  of miss maple we have spoken that
she is a principal woman who can stand
comparison with any of the beauties of
the chorus is significant next i liked
best the watson sisters while it is evi-
dent that their methods are frequently
of the variety stage loud and direct
their humor especially that of fanny
is good-natured and distinctively ameri-
can in tone writh the result that they
seldom fail to please when they paired
off with the dooleys the sum total was
up in the billions as our english friends

say the vampire dance by gordon
and william dooley was quite the fun-
niest thing these brothers have done

  adelaide and hughes are the featured
dancers- with their wedding number
and the toy dance standing out this
couple was never seen to better advan-
tage and it probably is true that this en-
gagement will do more to enhance their
popularity than anything they have yet
done adelaides is distinctly a winter
garden personality combining as she
does french chic with the wit and bril-
liance of the irish intelligence

  esther walker from vaudeville has
come in for a great deal of attention in
this new extravaganza but i must admit
that miss walker failed to impress me
very much she is an excellent number
leader for a certain type of song but i
cannot see that she is a star by any
means and for the rest the garden is
still lacking a big woman

  charles chic sale is seen briefly
and as usual scores virginia fissinger
returns in this show and ralph herz
plays several bits in legitimate manner
his rev fluffy ruff in the prison scene
being genuinely funny sydney jarvis
sings and shouldnt while flore revalles
is picturesque in appearance and secret-
ive in speech there are girls and girls
and girls all of them pretty all of them
well-dressed if not well covered

  it has become the fashion to acclaim
each new winter garden extravaganza
as the best ever but cold facts seem
to point that the messrs shubert have
outdone themselves with monte cristo
jr it has melody wit and beauty

al rays remember that a woman may say what she means without meaning
   what she says

 know a girl who absolutely does not flirt but she will be thoroughly proficient
    by the time she is twelve

a three-part story-part iii

synopsis of preceding installments

    barbara le moyne after seeing christopher keene fight for his life against five malays
on the pacific coast rides away for help but finds on her return that he has disappeared
later in san francisco barbara is courted by longfield who introduces keene to her long-
field who has all but won barbaras consent to marry him has deliberately courted keene
friendship there is something mysterious about longfield and keenes suspicions are aroused
keene is in san francisco in search of a clue to the scene of his fight with the malays the
wounds he received in that encounter have wiped from his mind all memory of the location
of the spot at which he had buried a treasure brought through great dangers from asia to
america barbara unwittingly gives him the name of the bay

vi

keene went away in a more happy
frame of mind than had long-
field she had not wittingly told
him but into his mind had flashed her
careless words bay san juan that
was enough he sought his room at the
club got his map and put his finger upon
it at once there his long adventure
was to end at that spot-end in success
and a new adventure was to begin a
never-ending adventure with a woman
a woman who thought him a traitor yet
who had returned his kisses a woman
who had pledged herself to another yet
who had not shrunk from his embrace
longfield sooner than permit her to
degrade herself by such an alliance he
would kill her or better still kill the
man

  it would have been easy to dispose of
longfield but keene decided to let him
do his worst and despite him to carry
out his own great design single-handed
let longfield look to himself he would
have need of all his finesse and trickery
to stop keene now

keene went to the window dawn



was at hand as he looked out across the
square he saw a man lurking under the
trees staring at the building there was
something suspicious in his movements
could it be that some creature of long-
fields was spying upon him

  keene changed his clothes quickly
his bag was already packed he had
intended to leave for the north by the
morning train he would go now

  the streets were empty when he set
forth the city was not yet awake
that made it more difficult for the man
to follow him undetected keene realiz-
ing how dose his pursuer was turned
a corner waited confronted him struck
him down before he could jump back or
voice a cry

  he watched the man roll senseless into
the gutter when keene struck he
struck hard that was his precept or at
any rate his practice miss lemoyne
could bear testimony to that in the mat-
ter of kisses longfield would also be in
a position to give evidence as to his strik-
ing force-later so his thoughts ran
as he hurried down the gray street

  it was not yet ten oclock when long-
field presented himself at barbara le-
cyrus townsend brady



moynes house and demanded to see her
she had gone to bed after the exciting
episodes of the night and toward morn-
ing had fallen into a deep sleep from
which her maid had difficulty in arousing
her at longfields insistence she
dressed rapidly and swept down upon
him in an exquisitely becoming morning
gown he kissed her hand led her into
the morning room and closed the door
he did not mince matters the exigency
was too great

  keene he began ive lost him i
i had him shadowed he knocked down
my man and got away do you know
anything of him

  she nodded concealment secrecy
were not in her blood any more than was
cowardice

  he was here she said with that bold
frankness which so became her and
which ordinarily he liked but which he
now found strangely irritating

  here this morning but you were
not up

  last night i

  last night after i left she
nodded again in this house he de-
manded angrily

  she did not like his tone his manner
he was losing control of himself in his
jealousy anger and disappointment
her next words did not tend to restore
his equilibrium

  not in the house in the garden she
said coolly

  he stared at her by a violent effort
he got back some at least of his self-
control and spoke more gently as if re-
monstrating

  and you were alone with him you
permitted-my affianced wife-

  not yet she said quickly

  you had speech with him what did
he say-what did he want-did he admit
-did you tell him-

  i told him that you said he was a
traitor and sought to betray his country
to germany

  ah- anything else

 nothing she answered shortly

 did he tell you where he hid the-
 he stopped but she promptly finished
 his sentence for him

 the platinum no he does not
 know i could have told him

 but you did not

 no

 and you will tell me

 no

 why not

 i could not help him and i will not
 help you was her amazing answer

 he stamped his foot in impotent rage
 despite his effort to restrain himself

 he is an enemy he protested i
 must know where he has gone and where
 he has concealed the platinum if you
 can help me and dont you will be as
 guilty as he the secret service-

 i know nothing as to that she an-
 swered maintaining her ground i told
 him that when his villainy had been ex-
 posed and prevented and he was pun-
 ished for it i had agreed to marry you
 and what did he say to that 

 he agreed he said if he were what
 you said he was he deserved to lose
 me-

  lose you is he mad  does he
 dare to-

 he says he loves me and i believe he
 does

 and you are waiting for him too
 for one of you

 which one

 that depends on- but he did not
 let her finish he knew

 good  when i come to you with the
 proof of his treachery in my hand
 then i will add my hand to it
 perhaps she would never have made
 so bold an avowal if with every passing
 moment she had not become more and
 more convinced of the entire innocence
 of keene however black might nay
 must be the case the secret service
 as represented by longfield had piled
 up against him

 she had never seen longfield so agi-


white treasure

 tated and so angry she had not believed
 it possible that he could give way to such
 violent emotion she liked him less than
 ever and carefully drew away from him
 one madman had taken her in his arms
 and kissed her she would not suffer an-
 other to do so

  he burst out furiously

  i thought before that i fought keene
for the greatest of all stakes i was
mistaken you are thrown into the bal-
ance platinum and the woman  i mean
to have them both let him look to it
good-by

  by the time longfield took up the pur-
suit keene was well on his way to bay
san juan the engineer in a swift au-
tomobile had been able to catch the early
morning newspaper express at a station
far up the line he had succeeded in
concealing his movements perfectly
longfield however was not worried by
his disappearance he was sure that
keene would remember where he had
concealed the platinum and supposed
that his delay in disposing of it had risen
from some difficulty in the negotiations

  at any rate the discoveries of the past
few hours would precipitate matters and
longfield had no doubt that if he could
get to the place whence the woman had
witnessed the fight he would there find
keene and the platinum barbara le-
moyne had not told him where that place
was but he knew where he had met her
and she was he reasoned a person of
sufficient importance for him easily to
find where she had camped and possibly
some of the men who had guided or
otherwise served her with that knowl-
edge the rest would be easy

  he summoned half a dozen trusted
assistants gave them explicit instruc-
tions and they all boarded the same train
that afternoon they were suitably dis-
guised got on the train separately did
not recognize one another and debarked
at stations before and after the one near-
est that for bay san juan their move-
ments by longfields direction were ex-

ceedingly circumspect longfield in view
of the emergency had ventufed upon the
risky act of chartering a special engine
and car and had preceded them up the
line

  when they arrived at the rendezvous
they found him awaiting them with
weapons two automobiles and one
dempsey a deputy sheriff whose services
he had enlisted dempsey had been one
of miss lemoynes party he had heard
her account and had joined in the search
for the missing keene on that day of
battle dempsey was told that longfield
was an agent of the u s secret service
and papers were exhibited that appeared
to substantiate the claim that he was on
the trail of a dangerous enemy of the
government a traitor and a german sym-
pathizer dempsey was asked as an of-
ficer of the law to assist in thwarting the
plan and capturing the man longfield
declared that he would swear out a war-
rant against the accused for the murder
of the malays and that the rest would
be easy

  he so inflamed the mind of the honest
if not very bright official that dempsey
was ready for anything he offered to
organize a posse but longfield declared
this was not neccessary as he had avail-
able certain deputies of his own whom he
had brought with him dempsey guided
them to the place of miss lemoynes
camp which they reached late at night
and offered at once to lead them to the
scene of the encounter which was several
miles away

  now longfield had also discovered
from the station agent that keene had
preceded him that he had inquired the
way to bay san juan that he had pur-
chased a few supplies and had ridden off
alone that morning on a horse hired from
the local livery stable

  longfield knew that keene had brought
off and concealed over six thousand
pounds of the precious metal he could
not carry it alone he could not even
get it ready for transportation by others
cyrus townsend brady



in a day therefore longfield decided to
wait until morning before seeking fur-
ther unless keene had chartered a boat
he would have to come back by way of
the camp hence it would be impossible
for him to escape carefully apportion-
ing the watches for the night longfield
turned in and went to sleep confident
that the next day would see the end of
keene and the beginning of the end of
barbara lemoyne though he did not
put it exactly in that way

  keene did just what longfield had
conjectured he would do he went on
alone to look over the ground before
doing anything else he had  idea
that longfield was in the vicinity he
did not for a moment believe that bar-
bara had given longfield any clue he
felt perfectly safe

  it was with the strangest feeling that
he drew rein on the little plateau whence
she had come to his assistance it well
indicates his feelings that he thus at first
identified it rather than by the battle he
had fought as he surveyed the clear-
ing it all came back to him there he
had stood when po-yanpen had made
that furious lunge there lie had
grappled with wan-aman over that
cliff he had thrust the malay he
stepped to the edge and peered over

  a tree growing far below him near
the waters edge had been uprooted in
some autumn storm amid its roots he
saw the skeleton of one of the malays-
po-yanpen himself or wan-aman pos-
sibly-which had lodged there and had
been hidden by the tree held there by
the trees roots it had not gone out to
sea with the rest if the old tree had not
blown down the body might have re-
mained concealed until it moldered away
some of the bright clofh of the jacket a
part of the shining sarong a faded hand-
kerchief caught on the branches told
their tale he turned away to pleasanter
things

  there he had fallen only to awake in
her arms so white against the heavenly

blue above him there under that tree
she had dragged him before she left him
he recalled how he had looked and lis-
tened down that hill he had crawled to
the boat upon that azure sea he had
been borne away

  as he stared seaward he gave thought
to young seymour who had shared all
his dangers who had backed him up with
youthful energy and enthusiasm in the
long journey from baku to within a few
days sail of that bay and shallow river
below him if it had not been for the
devoted comradeship and loyal support
of seymour scarcely more than a boy
even he could not have passed through
all the dangers in keeping watch over
white men and brown men and yellow
men strangers all they had divided the
time if seymour had not broken down
at last at the close of the long voyage
across the pacific almost in sight of the
goal with success practically within their
grasp po-yanpen would never have
dared attack him he would never have
met barbara young seymours life
seemed to be another of those wondrous
ties that bound together the man and the
woman and now he slept peacefully
far below the tossing waves beyond the
far horizon

  longfield he lifted his head and
laughed at the thought of him not mirth-
fully but in scorn as he did so his eyes
fell upon the open crest of the over-
looking hill not far away-just out of
earshot he noticed as he remembered
how she had called to warn him and in
vain she must have stood there he
stared up at it and laughed again but
differently this time in sheer gladness
of heart he would go up there later
he would stand where she had stood
he would kiss the spot her feet had
hallowed

  a traitor he his brow clouded at
the accusation he had brought that
platinum across the world for the united
states why had he hidden it for
safety its safety and his own he knew


white treasure

he had been under surveillance that
german spies were everywhere that he
had narrowly escaped a thousand dan-
gers that it was one thing to bring the
platinum to the shore and another to
deliver it besides he wanted the pleas-
ure of giving it in his own way he had
no bargains to make the government
could have it for whatever it chose to
pay or for nothing after he had led its
agents to the place of concealment and
had said there it is take it of
course now that seymour was dead he
felt morally bound to see that the boys
old mother back east got something out
of it

  as for himself he did not care to
do the thing was reward enough at
least he had not cared until he dis-
covered he loved barbara lemoyne she
was rich not fabulously but sufficiently
so for luxurious independence he
would have liked to match fortunes with
her before seeking her hand as it was
he was almost at the end of his resources
he had spent his money freely the sav-
ings of years in that dash from russia
to california and now it was practically
all gone

  besides what did it matter if she
loved him in the end as he determined
she should she would be as superbly in-
different to any such disparity as he was
love was all let her give him that and
for interest on the obligation he would
return her-the world

  his memory returned to him complete-
ly he plunged into the forest path
penetrated its deep recesses unerringly
marveling that he had ever forgotten
until he stopped before the vine-covered
mouth of the cave or niche in the rocks
upon which he had chanced and in which
he concealed his treasure with hand
that trembled a little he quickly lifted
the vines so as not to break the screen
and peered within

  it was there

  six thousand pounds of platinum for
the american government

  back in san francisco the wires were
calling longfield and in vain he had
left the station up the road and had given
no address the agent said when the
cabalistic messages had been relayed to
bay san juan with frantic appeals for
instant delivery at any cost from ob-
viously anxious senders there they lay
in the station awaiting his return

  other wires came from the east not
the orient but the atlantic side of the
continent and after reading one of
them a quiet soft-voiced unobtrusive
man named stevens called upon miss
barbara lemoyne he narrated little of
his plan or purpose or even of his de-
sire he showed her abundant evidence
however to establish himself in her good
graces when he asked her questions
afterward she answered fully and glad-
ly withholding nothing he was well
satisfied apparently with what he
learned for he thanked her warmly as he
turned to go her last words checked
him

  mr longfield told me that he too
was in the secret service of his govern-
ment i think he must have gone to bay
san juan if you find him i have no
doubt you can count upon his giving you
every assistance

  she remembered afterward how the
mans face had changed as he stood
listening to her parting words his lips
straightened under the sudden compres-
sion of his jaws his eyes flashed but
when he spoke it was in the same
smooth easy pleasant even gentle way
she had noted

  quite so he told you that did he
well its quite true on government
service i should dearly love to meet
him and i expect to do so

  before he left the room she called to
him

  ive told you everything

  yes

  tell me one thing in return
cyrus townsend brady



  if it does not run counter to my
duty

  do you think mr keene is an enemy
a traitor as mr longfield asserts

  dear miss le moyne i rarely assert
anything myself its dangerous in my
work

  you mean

  evidence is the only thing that
counts and without it one is so apt to
be-ah-mistaken

  her face lighted she could not help
it he stared at her his eyes twinkling

  pardon me the liberty he said gen-
tly turning through the open doorway
but for your sake i hope not

  and with that somewhat enigmatical
remark he was gone what did he
mean he had smiled as he vanished
from her sight somehow she took com-
fort from the fact and she needed
comfort for she could not escape the
conviction that she was not playing fair-
ly she was inclining more and more
to one side was it the right side to
one man was he the right man  she
had something to do herself she decided
and for her to decide was to act she
rose and called her maid

  there must have been some fatality
about the place where keene spent the
night that little open plateau by the cliff
overlooking the river where he had been
caught napping before for when he
opened his eyes in the morning it was
to gaze into no womans face but to see
longfield who had indeed kicked him
roughly out of sleep and now stood over
him gun in hand

  get up got you at last he said
harshly

  keene covered by the pistol arose
got on one knee and then with a scien-
tific football tackle as vigorous as it was
sudden he bowled longfield over like a
stricken tenpin

  as the latter went down for the tackle
was clean and low and hard his pistol
went off harmlessly and he called loudly
for help he was no mean antagonist

but keene was a year or two younger
and as hard as nails longfield was a
bit soft and the life he had lived had not
been so clean the two battling des-
perately rolled over and over in the
clearing but youth was finally served
longfield lay panting and exhausted at
the mercy of his conqueror now as he
knelt upon him his hand on his enemys
throat keene was at a loss what to do
with him

  he finally disarmed him and having
possessed himself of both weapons
longfields and his own he rose to his
feet and allowed the man he had just
mastered to sit up

  you nearly had me that time he
said coolly but it takes more than one
german blackguard to get me

  what do you mean roared long-
field furiously

  i mean what i say youre one of
the brutal blood-thirsty sneaking gang
of traitors thats been hounding me since
i left baku i thought id shaken them
off but youre worse than all the others
i am in the secret service said
longfield quickly

  doubtless but of germany

  lies lies protested the man
truth said the american imper-
turbably i suspected it at the club the
way you looked at that poor mess boy
the way you speak certain vowels the
mouthing to which you give way why
you almost said haus-frau the other
night you actually went away from
that dinner party humming heiden-
roslein i traced you to the closed sa-
loon of one of the most notorious enemy
aliens on the coast i intend to give you
up as soon as ive delivered the platinum
to the government thats what you are
after i suppose

 that and the woman returned
longfield insolently

  youll never get either

  i mean to have both

  longfield had his back to the bay and
river toward which keenes face was


white treasure

turned longfield who had got up be-
fore the others that morning and had
gone to the overlooking hill had seen
keene still asleep below him under the
trees he could not resist the tempta-
tion to take him alone although his
attempt had resulted so disastrously he
knew that his men under dempseys
guidance would soon find him indeed
he saw them creeping through the trees
and he backed up his insolent rejoinder
by leaping at keene despite the other
mans gun the struggle was a brief
one before keenes superior strength
and skill could be used dempsey and
the six accomplices of longfield had
seized him disarmed him and freed
longfield

  the latter was first to speak

  sheriff he exclaimed in triumph i
accuse this man of the murder of certain
harmless and inoffensive malays one in
particular named po-yanpen this is
his dagger he continued showing the
weapon he had stolen from barbara le-
moynes desk unnoticed by her two
days before

  i seen it afore said dempsey

  and there is the body of the poor
man continued longfield who had
caught a glimpse below of the hideous
thing tangled up in the fallen tree by
the waters edge

  stranger said the deputy sheriff
grimly laying his hand on keenes shoul-
der i guess youre caught with the
goods itll be jail for you

  and i accuse him of being a traitor
to the united states government in
bringing into this country and concealing
hereabouts a quantity of platinum with
intent to sell it to germany went on
longfield in relentless triumph

  things were coming his way he held
all the cards in his hand he would
be a fool indeed did he fail to play them

  didnt know nothin bout that plati-
num stuff said the deputy sheriff easily
murders enough its a hangin matter
hereabouts sometimes a trials made un-

necessary he added gloomily the
boys frequently takes matters in their
own hands

  exactly said longfield he turned
to keene you see he asked

  you damned scoundrel burst out
the other whereat longfield laughed
scornfully keene turned to dempsey
who are you he demanded

  im the deputy sheriff for this coun-
ty mister

  have you a warrant for my arrest
this is warrant enough i reckon
said dempsey tapping his pistol

  youre making the mistake of your
life in arresting me im neither a mur-
derer nor a traitor

  the court and the juryll have to settle
that answered dempsey unconcernedly

  theres the liar the traitor keene
went on passionately i accuse him of
being a german spy longfield ill bet
my life against a nickel his name is lang-
feld

  von langfeld if you please inter-
posed the other boldly

  there exclaimed keene instantly
look sheriff how the others are clos-
ing about you theyve got the drop on
you already

  he said he was in the secret service
of the government began dempsey un-
certainly

  and so i am but of the german gov-
ernment admitted longfield or von
langfeld to give him his proper name

  hell exclaimed dempsey reaching
for his gun

  before he could draw it the others
seized him and before they finished
both men were bound and helpless

  now said von langfeld youve
led us a long chase and given us a hard
fight keene but were at the end of
the road you and this damned fool
here have got mighty few minutes to live
unless you do what i say and do it
quick all the veneer of civilization fell
from him and he stood revealed for what
he was
cyrus townsend brady



 stranger i reckon heres where we
 cash in said dempsey i axes your
 pardon for bein sech a fool

 yes you do unless-

 von langfeld paused and looked at
 the two bound men

 unless what asked dempsey
 keene disdaining to speak knowing that
 neither he nor any other man of honor
 could accept any proposition the german
 would make

 unless keene tells me where the
 platinum is and confesses in writing that
 he is a traitor

 and whatll you do with his confes-
 sion asked dempsey

 show it to miss lemoyne answered
 von langfeld

 well whats the answer continued
 the sheriff looking at his fellow prisoner

 what would your reply be asked
 keene in turn smiling a little

 see him damned first

 exactly we are agreed

 von langfeld swore savagely reached
 -forward and struck keene heavily
 across the mouth

vii

 when barbara lemoyne descended
 from the sleeping car at bay san juan
 station that morning and confronted the
 quiet little man with whom she had con-
 versed the day before and who had
 come up on the same train it would be
 hard to say which was the more as-
 tonished the two stared at each other
 until the man broke the silence

 miss lemoyne what are you doing
 here he asked severely this is no
 game for a woman

 not when she is the stake for which
 men play

 ah i see he added reflectively

 and now that i am here i mean to
 help- she paused

 whom he asked

 you

  good said the little man who had
shrewdly appraised her this war has
taught us that women are absolutely to
be depended upon i have learned dur-
ing the night that the man i am after
came here

  mr keene

  certainly and others perhaps now
i want to get to the place where you
saw that battle of which you told me
and if i can get a good man to guide
me and perhaps help me so much the
better

  i can guide you myself i know
every foot of the way

  you could be of no help in-
  could i not try me

  by heaven i will let us get some
horses and go are you ready speed
is imperative

  ill be ready when the horses are
mr stevens she answered turning to-
ward the rude hotel across from the
station if you can get hold of a man
named dempsey tell him miss lemoyne
wants him

  as they mounted the horses the man
told the woman that dempsey had gone
away the day before with longfield into
the wilderness no one knew where

  and that was how and why the wom-
an looking down from the bare hilltop
as she had done a few months before
saw keene assaulted a second time only
now it was no savage uncivilized malay
who sought to stab but longfield who
struck him bound and helpless

  but this time barbara lemoyne did
not scream as she had done before she
watched keene reel under the blow
which he could not return and noted
with thankfulness that it was not re-
peated she saw the cowardly assailant
turn away her eyes were opened at
last she could almost rejoice over what
she saw save for keenes sake it had
enlightened her she knew now which
was true man which was traitor and
which she loved she looked at the man
at her side he too had seen of course


white treasure

but he did not seem so much surprised
as indignant

  it was to be expected he said in
answer to her look german spies be-
have worse than that as a rule

  german spies is he-oh thank
god she burst out brokenly

  the man comprehended instantly what
was back of her ejaculations

  time enough to thank god when
weve got him was his practical com-
ment

  and mr keene

  tm not altogether sure of him yet
miss lemoyne but it doesnt look as
if he stood in with that gang any too
well was his cautious yet reassuring
answer

  she faced him with indignation but
he stopped her with upraised hand

  no time for argument whether its
a case of villains falling out or not
weve got to get that scoundrel long-
field

  youll find that mr keene-

  weve got to release him too i had
no idea that longfield had brought a
gang with him but i cant wait to as-
semble a posse we must deal with the
situation ourselves look yonder he
exclaimed

  he pointed far out to sea and then
drew a small three-power glass from his
pocket focussed it swiftly and after
one look handed it to her she soon
made out a stout motorboat coming up
the coast at a rapid rate in the smooth
seas

  hes planned everything continued
the man thatll be his boat they
mean to get the-

  platinum she interposed as he hesi-
tated

  howd you know  no matter weve
got to stop em now i wish you were a
man

  they are seven against us two she
said swiftly well have to try to trick
them perhaps youll find a womans wit
will serve listen

  rapidly she outlined her plan while
he listened his face lighting

  good he said well try it are
you armed

  for answer she handed him her pis-
tol a small but serviceable automatic
which she drew from her jacket pocket
in that brief interval at the hotel while
he got the horses she had dressed her-
self for riding she wore just what she
had worn before when she had plunged
down the hill to help keene the first
time she threw back her jacket as
stevens took the pistol and disclosed a
small sheath-knife at her belt

  this will be all i need you keep the
pistol she said simply

  miss lemoyne i take off my hat to
you said stevens admiringly youre
better than a man in this situation good
luck to you ill do my part never
fear

  she nodded to him thrilling a little
that she had won his praise-his com-
mendation was well worth having she
had come to believe-and then she
mounted and rode cjown the familiar trail
toward the clearing and the two men
to whom she meant so much stevens
watched her until she had disappeared
he waited for a time as agreed upon
and then he went straight down the hill
afoot over places impossible for a horse
moving slowly and with great caution as
he drew near to the open

  do you see that fire asked von
langfeld pointing to a heap of blazing
brush his men had piled up at the foot
of a tree and had just lighted he did
not wait for an answer which would not
have been given in any case but went
on when it gets a better start were
going to warm your feet a little this cold
morning to stimulate your recollection
of the place where you hid the stuff

  i know perfectly well where it is now
you dog snarled out keene

  where  better tell me quick unless
you have a fancy to go lame for the rest
f your short life
cyrus townsend brady



  where youll never find it you sneak-
ing spy

 von langfeld rushed toward him
ferociously his hand upraised for an-
other blow his face white with passion
for keene who had no hope of rescue
had counted upon a swift end by provok-
ing him to murderous assault any-
thing he thought would be better than
the slow torture of fire

  why dont you kill the traitor and
have done with him broke in barbara
lelvloyne at the instant the german
stopped his rush and whirled about his
hand on his pistol its only i she
went on smiling at him as she spoke
oh im so glad to find you the
secret service men are after-mr
keene- von langfeld did not catch
the pause nor for that matter did
keene who was listening as if distraught
at this evidence that the woman he loved
had decided against him i came up
here to warn you i knew you wanted
to have the glory of catching him your-
self she went on hurriedly

  where are those secret service
men asked von langfeld looking
about him anxiously

  i dont know they didnt come
with me

  but you may have been followed
it is most serious

  nobody followed me she protested
as if the matter were of no moment
come and help me down

  reluctantly for her presence some-
how seemed unaccountably threatening
he lifted her from her horse and set her
on her feet keene said nothing in his
heart was wonder despair pity too deep
for words she did not look at him
dempsey intervened

 miss lemoyne he began you
know me im true american all
through that man youre talkin to is
a damned traitor an a thief to boot
keenes o k

  once i too thought mr keene was
a true american she said gravely

im sorry to see you in such bad com-
pany dempsey

  this was too much for dempsey he
shut up like keene the woman went
on

  why dont we go mr longfield now
that youve got him

  the platinum he answered he
wont tell where it is 

  why dont your men search for it
then it must be hereabouts they
came down that path i remember she
said pointing into the forest

  keene gritted his teeth together there
was no doubt as to the genuineness of
her disbelief in him she was playing
into von langfelds hands in every way
he opened his mouth to protest-and
then stopped suppose he could con-
vince her that von langfeld was a vil-
lain in what terrible danger would she
not be plunged by that discovery  what
might not the german do to her  he
turned to dempsey and whispered his
thought whereat the sheriff nodded and
also refrained from speech if he came
out alive he could convince her if he
died it would not matter to him yet
he would have died gladly to warn her

  a good an excellent idea exclaimed
van langfeld two of you watch the
prisoners two of you follow the trail
yonder and see where it leads one of
you tend the fire and you-he pointed
at the last-go down to the river and
see if the boat is coming

  as the men hastened to follow these
directions their chief turned to barbara

  you promised me after i had caught
him-

  yes i did she answered promptly

  well then-

  he made a step toward her as in
sudden timidity or bashfulness she
stepped hastily backward she was be-
tween him and the two prisoners
dempsey was reclining against a rock
keene was standing erect each was
securely bound as to hands and merely
hobbled as to feet two disarmed men


white treasure

amid half a dozen enemies did not require
extra lashings they could never release
themselves unaided the two men told
off to guard the prisoners were behind
von langfeld the others were already
moving away according to orders bar-
bara backed close to keene who was
nearest her

  not now not before- she cried
with well simulated reluctance as she
spoke she put her hands behind her

  keene was almost blind with rage
what was von langfeld about demp-
sey had no such reason to obscure his
vision and cloud his judgment he saw
the flash of a knife in the girls hands
and he straightened up and touched
keene quickly with his foot the loose
lashing giving him a certain freedom of
motion

  instantly keene understood his hands
were in front of him his arms held to
his side by his own waist belt which had
been buckled about them his fingers
closed over the knife and which was
the more precious to him the weapon or
the knowledge that she knew the truth
he could scarcely say

  she smiled at von langfeld as she re-
leased the knife he thought the smile
was for him and stepping forward
caught her in his arms the men behind
him turned away with a consideration
begotten perhaps of the thought that
their master might not care to have his
love making observed

  now cried von langfeld as he
drew her to him finding her strangely
yielding to his embrace she had sur-
rendered herself to keenes embrace a
few nights before but this yielding was
different then it was spontaneous de-
spite herself this was calculation be-
fore them all continued von langfeld
bending to kiss her and thinking how
doubly sweet would be that kiss wiith
keene looking on

  but betwixt lip and lip there is many a
slip as he was to learn with incredible
quickness and equal courage barbara

with her free hand whipped out the pistol
from the holster of the utterly unsuspi-
cious german and pressing the barrel
hard into his stomach as she did so cried
out

  hands up

  it would have been better if she had
pressed the trigger without a word for
a moment he stood motionless keene
had cut dempseys bonds and the sheriff
had seized the knife and done him the
same service as keene stooped to cut
his feet free he heard barbaras trium-
phant cry so did von langfelds other
men they turned but before they
could draw a weapon stevens pistol got
the first he stepped out from behind
a tree and covered the others at the
same time he threw barbaras pistol to
dempsey and the three remaining ger-
mans being helpless barbara stepped
back and handed von langfelds pistol
to keene

  before he could take it the big german
awoke to action the game was not lost
there were two men still with him two
were running back toward him down the
path the man going down to the shore
had stopped and turned at the sound of
the shot they were or soon would be
six to three and one woman von lang-
feld was a two-gun man he took ad-
vantage of the second in which keene
permitted himself to look at barbara to
spring back and sideways

  for the fatherland he shouted
drawing his second weapon ill get
you anyway he leveled his pistol at
keene and pressed the trigger

   the girl first of all sensed the danger
she threw herself before the man she
loved and was shot down then keene
went mad the rage of the old berserker
overcame him he dropped the pistol
and sprang at von langfeld

  the latter unnerved because to him
had come in a flash the awful conviction
that he had killed the woman he loved
as much as it was in him to love anyone
hastily fired at the man leaping upon him
gray walls



like a raging tiger he had no time to
decide whether or not he had scored a hit
before keene seized him in his mad
fury the american could have torn him
limb from limb he lifted him up in the
air bodily von langfeld struggled furi-
ously he saw death at hand he might
as successfully have coped with the wild
passion of the american as a leaf might
withstand the hurricane for one second
he cursed he prayed and then he fell
through the air he hurtled over the cliff
he drove to join wan-aman and po-
yanpen

  keene did not wait to see him fall  he
did not hear him crash and break on the
rocks below he did not take any further
part in the fierce battle by which dempsey
and stevis presently got the better of
the remaining spies as they came on
the bullets whistled about him unheeded

as he knelt down and raised the woman
he loved

  the old situation was reversed he
sought to do for her what she had done
for him with nervous hands he tore
away her dress the wound was in her
shoulder it was not fatal not even dan-
gerous she had fainted after that in-
stinctive movement to shield him his
caresses as potent as fhe spirit she had
once used called her back to life and love
in his arms

  i doubted you he whispered god
forgive me i doubted you

  it was you all the time didnt you
know didnt you feel  she made answer
her soul in her gaze

  and once again she gave back his
kisses not so hard as those in the garden
as he pressed his white treasure to his
heart

  gray walls

by mary morsell

omewhere there is a land unhemmed by walls
a place of vast free spaces where the sea
laughs in the sun and every white ship calls

 come rove with us for we alone are free 

 you spoke and then i followed after you

 stumbled along a thousand rock-strewn ways
 journeyed by starlight and in morning dew
 till wearily and after endless days
 we saw across the hilltops to a land

 of boundless vistas looking toward the sea-

 a place with no engirdling walls on either hand
 to hem love in nor make man less than free

 we hastened joyous to our paradise

 but scarcely had we claimed it as our own
 when from the silent valleys seemed to rise
 the same gray walls that we had always known
live stories and the golden key

rjhere was once a man who lived in a valley-a pretty valley but there was no

    creek in it and the man was lonely for the sound of running water

    then the man said

    i shall go up to the top of the hill and dig a well and draw water therefrom
and pour it onto the hillside so it will run down and form a creek in my valley

    and he did so

    very soon a little stream went leaping and shouting down the hill and clapped
its hands at sight of the pretty valley and crooned softly to itself

    the man saw and heard and was greatly pleased then he said

now i shall go down into my valley and enjoy the rivulet i have made

    and he went down

when he had descended and stood in the valley the stream had disappeared

    he forgot you see that the stream was of his making and could last only
while he drew water from the well and poured it out onto the hillside

    you say he was a very foolish man

    no doubt still you must know many very foolish men who conduct their
business with no more wisdom than the man in the valley showed in making a creek

    dont you know men who started their business with a rush gained a certain
speed and then sat back to hear things hum

    generally they fall asleep and awaken to find there is no stream flowing through
the valley

    the editors of live stories know nothing of any business except the making
of a magazine

    maybe they dont know much about that

    one thing however they know

    if the stream is to go on running delightfully through the valley the water
must forever and ceaselessly be drawn from the well and poured out on the hillside

    this at least the editors of live stories know

it is to this they are bending every effort and giving constant attention

    they are not satisfied they will never be satisfied

    the last word is so difficult to reach the last word silently steadily it
removes itself farther and farther as the weary pursuit goes on

    but you they want to please they want at least with each issue to come
nearer to pleasing you
