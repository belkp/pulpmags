the outer islands trading com-
panys lugger worked in through
the reef pulling hard against the
rush of the tide for a little way the
sea was like a mill race then as the
channel widened the lagoon of tana-
wai opened in placid blue enchantment
gulls circled it lazily pelicans skipped
with awkward flappings toward the
green banners of the beach

  skipper bill stood beside dave

weston at the rail a touch-and-go
run in through here he complained
and-what burns me up-it never
does any good

 you mean you never get any
cargo dave said

  not a pinch  scowled skipper bill
still long as we got a company sta-
tion here reckon ill have to call in

            copra

                   by allan vaughan elston

author of the howling wilderness

pany ltd expected him to make good
and so did sylvia farrel

  skipper bill shrugged gloomily
todd welsh had the same idear
young feller when he come here a year
ago and what happened he made a
rum failure same as the agents afore
him did now here you are in his place
maybe the competing station offers
better trade goods suggested dave

  it aint that bill protested with
conviction its logan brothers agent
red ryan hes got a winning way
with the natives its a gift son this
trading calico for copra

  the leaning palms on the shore were
close now dave could see grass roofs
gleaming through them with a fine
sweep of greenery beyond bright spots
of color on the beach were the tunics
of natives assembled there a chatter
of welcome reached dave then canoes
shot toward the lugger swarming
alongside as she dropped anchor in nine
fathoms

  most of the welcomers were boys-
swarthy clean-limbed youngsters of
pure polynesian strain a few were
girls with large dark eyes languid and
long-lashed one of these called gayly


argosy

to dave you like maybe come
shore 

  dave laughed do they all speak
that good english  he asked skipper
bill

  the run of em dont savvy ten
words bill said but a few of these
youngsters took a turn at the mission
school

  dave looked down at the one who
had called to him she wore pink satin
over a lace petticoat a leghorn hat
trimmed with shells was perched co-
quettishly on masses of black hair her
smile flashed boldly you like come
ashore my boat she repeated

  give her a play skipper bill ad-
vised slyly these are supposed to be
your customers so you might as well
start making friends

  believe id rather take a chance
with that one grinned dave he in-
dicated another girl in the background
this one was younger and by contrast
shy

  skipper bill chuckled youre not
a bad picker son thats samona
purty as ever like sunlight through a
fog he raised his voice come
alongside samona and meet our new
agent

the shy girl both embarrassed
and delighted paddled her canoe
to the luggers side

  dave smiled down at her im dave
weston he said and i hope well
be friends

  we shall make happy friend she
promised she was slim and gracious
and her soft cordial voice was like a
velvet touch in a scarlet tunic with a
wreath of hybiscus in her hair she
made an alluring picture against the
blue of the lagoon

  skipper him to the beach sam-
ona boomed bill ill be along in the

shore boat with all his luggage
samona was the envy of her com-
panions as dave lowered his long
white-clad frame into her canoe in a
moment they were skimming toward
the beach

   you stay long time the girl asked
hopefully

  she seemed so ingenuous that dave
saw a chance to get first hand and
sincere information he was eager to
come to grips with his job and first of
all he wanted to find out why his pre-
decessors had failed on tanawai island
why did the tanawains take all their
copra to the other agent red ryan 

  my company is taking mr welsh
away because your people havent
traded with him he said dont they
like him

  oh yes she said quickly mr
welsh very nice man

  then why dont they take him
copra

  a shadow crossed her face because
our head men say it is tabu

  dave frowned he knew that in-
numerable tabus many of them found-
ed on superstition rather than reason
had always shackled the polynesian
peoples that seems stupid samona
he protested you dont believe in a
tabu like that do you

  she shook her head vigorously no

i	think they are not good she said
then she added shyly i have like
tabus of your people best

  this mystified him what are the
tabus of my people he asked

  she seemed surprised that he didnt
know them the good priest have be
here long time she said he have die
now but he teach me the ten tabus of
your people

   dave still was puzzled

  he are make me good catholic
she explained simply and looked quick-
copra



ly to see if he approved die idea

  then with a shock of humility he
understood what she meant by the ten
tabus of his people it made him look
at her writh a new interest she was
little more than a child he realized
and breathlessly beautiful her face
was a perfect brown oval the features
straight and delicate her body slim
supple round she was fragrant and
fresh like rain on the desert but what
most astonished and impressed dave
weston was a faith which believed only
in those tabus once inscribed by moses
on tablets of stone

   i guess youve got the right slant
on this tabu business samona dave
said as the keel of the canoe grounded
on the beach

  dave stepped ashore and was imme-
diately surrounded by cordial natives
samona kept close to him and explained
to her people that his name was dave
and that he was her happy friend

  the luggers shore boat arrived and
skipper bills voice broke in gruffly
cant understand why todd welsh
aint here to meet us

  is that our station dave asked
pointing down the beach to a low
rambling structure with a grass roof

   no thats the logan brothers lay-
out bill said red ryan hangs out
there sharp as a sharks tooth that
feller hell bear watchin

   to the left bill indicated the com-
pany station which was entirely of
sheet iron badly in need of paint ex-
cept for wide verandas on four sides
and a generous shade of cocoanut
palms the place struck dave as rather
desolate

   up there on the hill is where gren-
ner lives hes resident governor here
and what he says goes bill thumbed
toward a white bungalow on a distant
eminence it  was nested in flowering

shrubs with a bower of ferns flanking
well-kept terraces

  three kanaka sailors from the lug-
ger were now at hand with daves lug-
gage they followed with it as dave
and skipper bill walked briskly toward
the outer islands company store

   the door of the place was open its
screen hanging on one hinge on a
veranda table stood a half empty beer
bottle with flies buzzing about it as
he entered the store dave saw no sign
of life other than cockroaches swarm-
ing on the counters the shelves
though covered with dust were well
stocked twist tobacco bolts of cotton
cloth tins of coal oil knives beads
tools canned meats

  ahoy welsh look alive bawled
skipper bill there was no answer

   bill took a look into the copra room
same old story he reported not a
sack o cargo on hand

  it was fairly clear that welsh had
made few if any trades since bills last
call hes probably out in the jungle
shootin pigs growled bill

   but when they went into living quar-
ters at the rear a shock transfixed them
agent welsh lay in bed with a copra
knife protruding from his back the
sight paralyzed dave and even the
wind-bitten face of skipper bill went
bloodless

  after a moment of staring they
backed from the room come along
son bill said hoarsely we gotta re-
port this to the govnor

ii

resident grenner was drinking
in his office with red ryan when
bill and dave burst in on them hugh
grenner was a ruddy new zealander
shiny bald and round at the waist

ive got news blurted skipper


argosy

bill somebody stuck a knife in todd
welsh

  grenner blinked small pale eyes at
bill then he stared askance at dave
weston dave explained i was sent
from the papeete office to relieve
welsh we found him murdered

  with a knife repeated bill

  ryan reached for his glass and
drained it with a gulp over the glass
his hard frosty eyes met daves the
logan brothers agent was a huge
barrel-chested man with a shock of
flaming hair his shirt was open and
dave could see that a winged dragon
was tattooed on his chest ryans gaze
shifted from dave to bill what kind
of a knife he asked

  a copra knife bill said

  ryan grimaced knowingly that
makes it simple he said to grenner
welsh mustve been philanderin with
some of the local belles and gotten
caught at it

  grenner nodded its happened to
many a white man in these islands
the resident said smugly grunting he
rose from his chair and they all went
down to the outer islands station to
review the evidence

  except for that copra knife no clew
whatever was found a crowd of curi-
ous half-frightened natives had as-
sembled in front of the store and gren-
ner held impromptu court on the
veranda barking out innumerable and
futile questions

  we might ask stoney about it
grenner said finally he generally
knows whats going on around here
send for stoney

  whos stoney dave asked skip-
per bill

  hes a down-and-out britisher
bill explained when he beached here
fifteen year ago he came into this
store and said im stoney broke

brother wot about a dram on the
cuff the agent then was a half-caste
who didnt savvy much english he
stood the drink and charged a shilling
on the books against mr stoney broke
so they called him that ever since
when stoney slouched into view
dave saw as disreputable a derelict as
ever dug clams on a southern beach

  i just eard abort it govnor
stoney bleated poor old welshy
aint it eil the wiy things appen
when did you last see him alive
grenner demanded

  larst night abort sundown gov-
nor e stood me a drop o bitters-
best pal i ever ad e was rheumy
tears came to the beachcombers eyes

  very well grenner announced
with a shrug ill make a report to
my government superiors and rest as-
sured ill find the criminal

renners investigation struck
dave as a farce it consisted
mainly of heckling natives with ques-
tions as to what tanawain women
welsh had paid attentions nothing
came of it todd welsh was buried
under a breadfruit tree with the guilt
of his murder unsolved

   skipper bill steamed away in his lug-
ger dave remained forlornly alone in
a store to which customers nevercame

  they must come dave resolved and
set his jaw stubbornly to the task of
making good as a constant reminder
that he must he hung sylvia farrels
framed photograph on the wall of his
store just as soon as he could make a
success of the station she was coming
from papeete to be his wife as the
daughter of a wealthy british planter
she had been used to the best and dave
had promised that he would provide it
sylvia had said she would wait

   ill have a cargo of copra ready for
copra



your next call dave assured bill when
the lugger hove anchor or find cut
why

  he began his drive for trade by
cleaning up the store and re-arranging
his stock then he took a bag of sam-
ples and set off to make a round of the
villages at the first village he pre-
sented the head man with a fine meer-
schaum pipe the head man was de-
lighted and promptly brought forth
gifts of his own consisting of fruit and
carved ornaments

  dave then displayed his samples
but he couldnt make the head man
understand until samona appeared and
proceeded to interpret beautifully

   i take you to all the village she
offered graciously

   in succeeding days she escorted dave
to the various island settlements
faithfully she translated daves plea
that the tana wains bring copra to his
station and receive fair trade in return

  what does the head man say
samona

  he say that he like make you his
son that his house is your house that
he are come bring many present 

   the deluge of gifts arrived and sam-
ona helped arrange them in the store
before dave knew it she had made
herself indispensable her laughter
drove away loneliness and she brought
a guitar to his veranda and sang to him
soft polynesian love songs the songs
brought other youngsters and soon
daves station became the social center
of the island there were dances by
moonlight under the palms with sam-
ona as hostess and when the head
men came bearing gifts she received
them and thanked them prettily for
dave and because she was from the
highest ranking family on the island
her sponsorship brought him many
friends

  samona brought him everything but
copra if a head man had a few shil-
lings in cash he came in to spend it
recklessly at daves counter but not a
single fiber of that staple which makes
the wheels of south seas commerce
turn crossed his threshold

  all copra went to the logan broth-
ers station where it was bargained for
sharply by red ryan and dave began
to realize that hed have not a sack of
cargo ready when bills lugger next
appeared in the lagoon

one day he came upon the derelict
stoney half asleep with his
ragged back to a palm see here
stoney dave said to him whats
going on around here anyway
stoney blinked you mean oo done
in poor old welshy

  no i didnt exactly mean that but
who did kill him

  stoney looked both ways then low-
ered his voice yer kin lay to it
matey it was a white man done it a
nitived arve tiken the knife awiy with
im

  are you accusing grenner and
ryan challenged dave

  accusin aint provin stoney
hedged but i seen welshy the diy
afore he was done in an e told me
ed just found out abort why the in-
landers wouldnt bring im any copra
said e ad a full report writ out an
was gonna send it orf on the next
boat

  did he mention grenner or ryan
didnt mention no nimes close-
lipped e was and looked kinder
skeered but listen matey ive been
on this beach a long time an ive ad
arf an eye open i was ere when ryan
come and up to then the two stores got
a even break on copra but arfter ryan
come the nitives quit your store cold


argosy

   dave puffed thoughtfully at his pipe
how do you suppose ryan manages
it stoney

    es got somethin on grenner e
as if yer find out wot it is theyll
both ave to leave then yerll git all
the copra on the hiland

  before dave could answer some-
thing catapulted from the sky and
smashed into the sand close by him it
only missed crushing his skull by
inches

  i almost got a chunk of it right
then he said with a grimace

  never worry abort them failin
cocoernuts matey stoney assured
him funny thing but they never hit
nobody i been sleepin under these
trees fer fifteen years and the nitive
villages are allers in cocernut groves
with brown bibies pliyin under em
alia time but the cocernuts allers miss
em

  dave had often heard the same
thing-a tradition in the south seas
that people under cocoanut trees lead
charmed lives

  but never mind that stoney what
about grenner and ryan if ryan can
make grenner jump through a hoop
why should it affect the natives
the nitives pay taxes and fines by
workin on the roads if they aint gort
cash stoney explained grenner es
magistrate jury tax assessor an
heverything else ere ryan likely says
to im see ere grenner if theyre
my customers you let em orf easy if
they aint my customers you stick
em 

iii

when dave left stoney he was
indignant and yet not alto-
gether discouraged he felt sure he
could checkmate grenner by attending

court trials himself and demanding fair
play

  but cases were infrequent the
islanders were generally well-behaved
and weeks passed before a native stood
before grenner charged with intoxica-
tion in which state he had broken a
kava bowl over his hosts head

  the defendant being an important
customer of ryans dave watched the
proceedings alertly to his surprise
grenner severely fined the man thirty
shillings in lieu of payment the culprit
could spend thirty days washing dishes
in the residency kitchen

  a fair judgment dave thought
there was no way for him to learn that
grenner later sent one of his constables
to inform the man that the fine was
remitted

  day after day the islanders took
copra to ryan when the logan broth-
ers regular lugger dropped anchor a
full cargo was ready for it but when
skipper bill chugged in through the
reef dave weston had nothing for
him at all

   its tabu to trade here dave re-
ported gloomily he went on to recite
stoneys theory about grenner and
ryan

   bill poured himself a tall tumbler of
rum on the veranda a group of boys
and girls were dancing samona was
strumming a guitar and the soft notes
of her song same pleasantly through
the door

   looks like tough weather ahead for
you son bill said once one of these
tabus gets to operatin its hard to lick
it gets set like cement grenner may
not even have to keep on with any more
high-handed taxes and fines

   i dont see why dave protested

  thats because you dont under-
stand the native mind look at it this
way suppose a cocoanut drops on a
copra



native and kills him his people would
think nothin of it but if another nut
drops from the same tree and kills an-
other native then the head mend get
together and slap on a tabu and itd
stick tight for generations even if no
other cocoanut ever did drop outa that
tree the nativesd always stay away
from it

  dave went to his desk and wrote a
discouraged letter to slyvia farrel and
bill took it with him when he went
down to the lugger

  when the boat was gone dave wan-
dered down the beach to find stoney
stoney lived with a tanawain wife in
a grass shack well apart from any vil-
lage the house was built against a
cliff from which spring water dripped
and was banked with banana trees and
giant ferns

  approaching it dave heard stoney
cry out from within leave orf i tell
yer get outer ere an leave me
alone

  there came a whacking sound fol-
lowed by a scream from stoney and
dave entered to see red ryan twist-
ing stoneys wrist stoney was on his
knees howling

  pay that chit you owe me ryan
threatened or ill take it out of your
hide

  he struck stoney a blow which sent
the slighter man across the room
stoneys head struck a wall and he col-
lapsed there unconscious

  ryan turned to face dave weston
this bums been mooching rum at my
counter for years he explained with
a grin

  how much does he owe you  dave
asked quietly

  somethin around two quid ten

  dave produced his wallet and
counted out the money here you
are

  ryan in surprise took the money

  now come outside and take some-
thing else ryan

  when they were outside dave
promptly gave ryan a stinging slap on
the side of the head

ryan reddened he came charg-
ing like a buffalo and dave
stepped aside to let him go by as
ryan whirled daves right caught him
neatly on the chin

  ryan dove for a clinch but dave
shook him off and his left drove quick
punches into the mans stomach ryan
bellowed flailing his arms dodging
dave jabbed a right to the head which
rocked ryan back on his heels

   ill kill you ryan screamed

  like you did welsh said dave
and again his knuckles stung ryan on
the cheek

  a moment later he put all his
weight into a punch that struck ryan
full on the mouth ryan went down
with blood spouting from his lips he
sprawled there with his back to a palm
his head rolling groggily his two
upper front teeth were gone

  dave waited for him to get up
when he did not dave left him and
went home

  samona was in the store filling a
vase with bright blossoms

  just had a run-in with ryan dave
explained when she noticed a slight cut
over his eye

   the girl was instantly distressed it
was not good to fight ryan she said
always it bring bad luck

  it wont bring him back those
teeth dave grinned

  she was bathing his scratch with
cocoanut oil when a messenger came
summoning dave to appear before
grenner

  dave went promptly to the resi-


argosy

dency to liis astonishment he found
that ryan had preferred charges of
assault and battery ryan himself was
there as complaining witness

  this guy got sore because i get all
the trade ryan testified so he
jumped me from behind and knocked
me down with a club then he kicked
out my teeth ryan opened his mouth
to prove it all the while glaring malig-
nantly at dave

  thats a lie dave said i caught
him beating up stoney so i took him
outside and bashed his face in

  i didnt touch stoney insisted
ryan i was just trying to collect a
bill

  a merchant has a right to collect
from deliquent customers grenner de-
creed solemnly how he does it is no
concern of yours weston moreover i
wont countenance any brawling on this
island you yourself admit disfiguring
the plaintiff so im fining you ten
pounds

  daves temper broke leash youre
a fat-headed crook grenner

  then eyes clashed

  five pounds more for contempt of
court the resident snapped he turned
to his crew of native constables hold
this man in custody till he pays his
fines

  dave biting his lip counted out fif-
teen pounds payment of the sum would
leave him almost penniless

  walking back to the station he was
able to consider the affair soberly it
seemed to him that ryan had acted en-
tirely out of character a tough hairy
trader with a dragon tattooed on his
chest should not by the usual prece-
dents go rushing to a magistrate on
the contrary he would be expected to
get himself a copra knife or a gun
and make murderous assault on the ad-
versary

  and that reflected dave w-as exact-
ly what had happened in the case of
todd welsh which meant that ryan
had simply been clever enough not to
repeat the same type of assault two
successive competitors found stabbed
would have been like finding two men
crushed by cocoanuts dropping from
the same tree

  grenner was in it writh ryan-that
was clear enough between them they
controlled this island and every soul
on it

a gain the logan brothers boat
called and again ryan had a
copra cargo ready for it then skipper
bill called gain samona canoed ryan
out as the lugger dropped anchor

 any cargo bawkd bill as dave
and the girl climbed over the rail

  not a sack dave reported

  bill handed him two letters the first
from the companys main office re-
buked dave sharply for making even
less of a showing than previous agents
it announced that hereafter dave would
be put on a strictly commission basis
no trades no pay

  the second letter was from sylvia
farrel a ring fell from it dave read 

    its no go dave the entire situation is
  impossible i cant bring myself to live on
  that savage island where the natives stab
  traders while they sleep and frankly i
  cant quite be reconciled to marrying a
  failure this is goodbye-and dont think
  too hard of me please

  dave sat dowrn on a hatch and stared
glumly ashore but the steep green
mountain held no beauty

 have a drink son and brighten
up bill sat down by him with a bottle
of brandy

  dave snatched it knocked the neck
off on the rim of the hatch and up-
turned the bottle to his lips and skip-
copra



per bill seeing the open letter and the
ring understood

  bill went to the rail and called down
to a score of young tanawains who
were alongside in canoes come
aboard boys and girls he yelled
dave needs cheerin up

  they came scrambling over the rail
strike up a song bill said heartily
and maybe we can pull dave outa the
dumps hes bluern a sharks belly
all afternoon there there was sing-
ing and dancing on the deck but dave
ignored it he continued to sit mood-
ily on the hatch drinking to quench the
bitterness in him by sundown his brain
was reeling

  dont take it so hard bill said
he put a fatherly hand on daves
shoulder whats a woman anyway
if one quits you all you gotta do is
pick out anothern pick one thatll stick
by you next time

  dave shrugged away from him he
knocked the neck from another bottle
and kept on drinking

  what about thatn over there
bill continued slyly his thumb indi-
cated samona who was perched on the
rail- making guitar music for the
dancers shes a cute one dave purty
as a hummin bird but not near so
flighty whats more ive an idear
shed stay with a man

  shes native dave mumbled
what of it argued bill white
or brown makes no never mind down
in these islands what a man wants is
loyalty

  dave took another drink then his
eyes shifted toward samona he saw
the warm olive of her skin the rich red-
ness of her cheeks and lips-her dark
melting eyes he saw a luxury of shin-
ing hair that tumbled to her waist with
flowers wreathing it bare feet and
hands as shapely as any queens

  dave stood up two boys were beat-
ing drums and the pounding was like
a savage tom-tom in his ears the deck
was spinning but he managed to cross
to samona

  when he reached her he crushed her
in his arms kissing her lips he pressed
her to his breast

  will you marry me samona he
said gently

  her head went back and her eyes
stared into his for a moment wonder
and rapture were in her face then
tears came and made her eyes like stars
i have love you all the days she
whispered

  dave called brusquely to skipper
bill you can marry people on your
own deck cant you

  as slick as a whistle bill asserted

  the young tanawains applauded
gleefully bill went below deck and
came up with the book the sight of it
sobered dave a moment then he saw
sylvias letter on the hatch and his jaw
set stubbornly get along with it bill
he directed

  bill got along with it then followed
more drinking dancing pounding of
drums dave couldnt remember when
they carried him ashore it was a pagan
festival from which he awoke with a
scorched throat a roaring head-and a
polynesian wife

iv

t tis reaction was apathetic remem-
bering sylvias inconstancy dave
simply didnt care one way or the other
he took sylvias framed photograph
from his wall and smashed it over the
counter then he sat sullenly on the
veranda watching skipper bills lugger
chug out through the reef

  it was days before samona could
make him laugh the girl herself was in


argosy

heaven she sang to him waited on
him washed and pressed his whites
scrubbed the floors and hung garlands
everywhere about his house

  and gradually she melted dave
sometimes when the palm trees whis-
pered in the darkness he thought that
he was happy with her

  you have no sorrow to be my hus-
band

  why should i samona only trou-
ble is youre too good for me youre
lovelier than starlight-sweetern the
milk of a ripe cocoanut

  but when he watched the islanders
trooping to trade copra at ryans store
his happiness vanished the old tabu
still held rigidly no tanawain would
take copra anywhere but to ryan dave
was constantly reminded of his own
failure he was penniless-and with
no pay in sight

  why are you not be happy
samona pleaded

  because i want to buy you
pretties he explained to take you
on a happy honeymoon to papeete to
do that i must first be successful here

  little by little she came to under-
stand that it wasnt enough that she
should bring him love and laughter she
must also bring him success

  samona put her mind shrewdly to
that end how could she bring success
to the man she loved  she grappled with
the problem willing to sacrifice any-
thing to achieve its solution

red ryan stood before a mirror
scowling at his open mouth the
void left by two missing teeth grossly
disfigured him and at the same time
reminded him of his grudge against
dave weston ill get even with that
blighter he said fiercely

  a copra cargo was ready for his
next ship but that for ryan wasnt

quite enough he had to devise a way
to score even more cruelly against his
rival at the other station

  looking from his window now he
saw dave out on the lagoon he was in
a canoe with samona and they were
coming in with a catch of bonita a
sea breeze brought to ryan their happy
laughter

  thats the ticket ryan muttered
with a flash of inspiration thats
what i gotta do take the girl away
from him make a bum outa him it
would

  in ryans stock were certain gaudy
treasures he took them out-a neck-
lace of brilliant red glass a sarong
of green silk from java a pair of
gilded slippers from japan

  next morning samona came to a
pool near the shore high tide filled
it twice daily and there was a cliff by
it for diving it had always been a
favorite plunge for the young tana-
wains

  samona poised her slim figure on
the cliff she kicked off her sandals
her tunic slid into a pink circle at her
feet nude except for the pareu about
her hips she dived

  with the red glass necklace the
javanese sarong and the japanese
slippers in hand ryan sauntered down
to the pool

  take a peep samona he grinned
pretty cute outfit what just got em
in with the last stock o trade goods

  samona admired the ornaments as
any island girl would

  come around some time ryan
invited slyly an ill let you try em
on

  he hardly hoped for an immediate
conquest on the contrary he antici-
pated many and patient approaches
her response therefore surprised him
maybe samona smiled then fixed
copra



her eyes in rapture on the javanese

sarong maybe i come sometime
ryan snatched the girls arm and
tried to draw her to him she pulled
away laughing but her lips repeated
maybe i come some day

   listen ryan urged ardently why
dont you leave that chump weston
and come live with me ill treat you
right give you anything you want
she let her lashes drop coyly back-
ing a step in retreat before ryans ad-
vance

   that guys busted ryan argued
what you need is a head man like
me

   her eyes met ryans with a seduc-
tive smile ego prevented him from
guessing that she was playing a game
deeper than his own-that those dark
drooping lashes concealed a bold and
desperate inspiration

   i think it over samona promised
i let you know

   she took up her tunic and sandals
and scampered away and ryan re-
turned in a glow to his store

samonas heart was thumping
like mad as she made her way
through the screen of ferns which ob-
scured the house of stoney and makea
makea was stoneys plump middle-
aged wife and had long been an inti-
mate of samonas samona knew that
she could trust both makea and stoney

  she burst in upon them with an
amazing confidence i like make my
man big success i like my people bring
all copra to his store

   stoney cocked an eye at her they
darsent do that its tabu

you help me samona pleaded we
make bigger tabu against ryan
stoney thought it over yes he
agreed it might work out if they could
do that the tanawains had only one

 commercial crop-copra they had to
 trade it somewhere if they couldnt
 take it to ryan they would have to take
 it to dave weston

   wots goin on in that purty ead
 o yourn samona

   you are remember french half-
caste family live here once she whis-
pered

   you mean the brousseau outfit
 prompted stoney gaping sure it was
 tabu to go anywhere near their planta-
 tion

   makea too remembered no tabu
 had ever been so fearful or rigid on
 the island

   samona after swearing them to se-
 crecy unfolded a plan the boldness
 of it shocked them both stoney and
 makea argued against it dive as-
 serted stoney  ed never stand for it

   but dave mustnt know anything
about it samona said neither must
any human on the island except them-
selves if the plan succeeded then her
- people would take no more copra to
ryans store it would all go to dave
for lack of another market

   all right go ahead with it stoney
 said finally makea an me well keep
 our lips buttoned and elp yer all we
 can

   an hour later ryan was delighted
 to see samona enter his store he
 greeted her with effusion and this
 time when he displayed his treasures
 she put them on she posed in them in
 apparent rapture before a mirror

   like em  grinned ryan

   she answered by putting her arms
 about his neck and kissing his lips
 you be lonesome maybe she mur-
 mured i are not like you be lone-
 some

   she hid her eyes against his shoulder
 so he couldnt see the tears starting
 there he must not guess that to be


argosy

 clasped in his arms was like crucifixion

  ryan held her triumphantly you
can have anything you want here
sweetheart he crowed just as long
as you dont go back to that weston
bum

  when native customers entered the
store they found ryan holding samona
on his knees and caressing her fondly
he winked at the intruders go ask
dave weston if he aint lost some-
thing he suggested maliciously

  the news speedily reached dave and
he refused to believe it but when
samona hadnt come home by late
afternoon he went looking for her
he asked stoney

  stoney shook his head dolefully i
eard shes tiken up with the bloke
ryan

  dave stalked into ryans store he
saw samona seated on a counter ryan
stood by her holding a bottle of beer

  sight of them paralyzed dave he
stood choking for a moment then
called angrily get out of here
samona and come on home

  i like best stay here samona pro-
tested she averted her eyes from
daves

  go roll your hoop mister ryan
jeered cantcha see shes picked her
a new man 

  daves fist lashed out for ryans
chin ryan toppled backward and hit
the floor in a heap

  are you coming samona dave
demanded with tense finality

  instead of coming she jumped to
the floor kneeled there and took ryans
head in her arms i not coming she
said bravely

dave went home and within an
hour he was summoned before
grenner

  youre charged with entering an-

other mans house and assaulting him
do you deny it 

   he stole my wife i wish id killed
him

  your wife went to him of her own
free will grenner said coldly since
you were the aggressor in the victims
own house im forced to fine you ten
pounds

   and if i dont pay it dave chal-
lenged

   you can go to jail

  dave laid his gold watch on the
table will you accept this till i raise
the money

  grenner accepted the watch and
dave went angrily out and at that
same moment at ryans samona was
seated on the arm of ryans chair rub-
bing liniment on his bruised chin

  youre here for keeps samona
ryan grinned his jaw ached but aside
from that he was feeling immensely
satisfied with himself for now his re-
venge on weston was complete

  you mean you like marry me
samona asked

  ryan frowned for a moment then
his face cleared this young girl pleased
him more and more every minute yes
hed even marry her if she insisted
but i are already marry she said
you wont be long he grinned
weston got an eyeful hell divorce
you soon enough then youll be free
in the meantime-

   in meantime she supplied quickly
i stay here only daytime i are good
christian please i keep your house
nice yes night time i go stay with
my people

  ryan argued with her but it was
useless and he was afraid to press the
matter for fear of losing her altogether
the whole island would believe she was
living with him even if technically
she was not dave weston would be-
copra



lieve it and that was what ryan really
wanted

  samona remained with him until the
last customer had left for the night it
was dark outside and ryan locked the
store then she kissed him goodbye
until morning and ran through the
woods to the house of stoney and
makea

  they were expecting her and makea
had made a pallet for her samona
flung herself on it sobbing humiliated
aching with each heartbeat all night
she lay there beseeching forgiveness
from the god of her faith-the god of
the ten tabus

  but at daylight she was cooking
ryans breakfast in his kitchen and
while he was eating it she slipped away
to bathe in the pool

  other tanawains were there and
they asked her if it were true she had
left dave for ryan samona made her-
self admit it brazenly ryan was rich
and successful she said and he had
given her many beautiful things

  weeks passed and by day samona
rarely left ryans store except to bathe
in the pool no one on the island other
than herself ryan stoney and makea
knew that she always slipped away by
night

  at his own store dave brooded he
grew listless and disheveled and he
drank freely from the trade gin on his
shelves with no one to wash and press
his whites his wardrobe became as dis-
reputable as stoneys

  he thought of divorcing samona
but what was the use that he rea-
soned would be just what they wanted

  with bitterness smoldering in him
he resolved to remain on the island
only long enough to fashion a noose
for ryans neck ryan he felt certain
had murdered welsh and for that
crime he must be brought to book ill

see him hanged for it dave resolved
stubbornly

  there should be a way to prove it
sometimes coldly sober and sometimes
sunk deep in his cups dave strained his
mind implacably toward that end over
and over he essayed to reconstruct the
scene of todd welshs death many
times he recalled his horrified intru-
sion upon it with skipper bill he re-
membered now that some unnatural
feature of the scene had seemed to im-
press him vaguely-a thing which
horror had immediately shocked from
his recognition desperately but in
vain he tried to resurrect that impres-
sion it was a negative clue he thought
-something which should have been
there and wasnt   

v

fihe illusion of samonas unfaith-
fulness had endured three months
when the girl embarked upon a project
even more bold and terrifying late
one night she left ryan as usual and
went to stoneys there she brought
forth a vial containing a milky white
stain makea had helped her mix it
from fruit juices and the sap of a tree

  the time are come now samona
announced

  she stripped to the waist turning
her back toward stoney and makea
by the eerie light of candlenuts makea
began staining a white patch on the
girls flesh it was a circular patch about
six inches in diameter and was stained
exactly in the center of samonas back

  the milky whiteness of it stood out
in sickly contrast to the firm brown
of her skin

  but stoney was pessimistic yer
wont fool nqhody he predicted
they could look at yer fice an see
yer as ealthy as i am


argosy

   they will believe when i admit it
myself samoa insisted they are be-
lieve it when they see brousseau girl
yes 

  they sure did stoney conceded
that was ten year ago an it skeered
ell outer hevery nitive on the hiland
somebody seen er slip into the woods
all by erself an undress they seen
er old a mirror to look at er back
there was a big white spot all blotchy
like an it set the nitives tarkin first
thing yer know they found out the
truth then the girl an all er blood
kin were deported

  in the morning ryan woke to find
samona as usual preparing his break-
fast

  and as was her custom while he
ate she slipped away to the pool

   a group of boys and girls were bath-
ing there but samona seeming to be
troubled and embarrassed conspicu-
ously avoided them she did not enter
the pool instead she withdrew to a se-
cluded place down the beach screening
herself behind rocks before dropping
off her tunic

   it wasnt like samona to be so un-
sociable and the others noticed it and
after several mornings of such odd con-
duct a group of samonas old bathing
comrades went down to see why she
had become so exclusive she let them
creep up on her and when they
appeared around a corner of the rocks
they found her holding a mirror in her
hand-holding it so that standing in
a twisted posture she could see the
round white patch on her back her
face was contorted with despair

  when her friends came closer she
snatched up her tunic in confusion but
they had all been able to observe the
white patch

  you will not tell the governor
please she implored them if you

tell governor i will be deported she
pleaded i and all my blood kindred
and please you must not come near
me again

  as they began to get a horrified
inkling of her condition they backed
farther away and stood whispering in
a little wrhile they ran quickly to the
nearest village where they reported
breathlessly to the head man

  consternation gripped the head man
he hastened to the beach and spoke to
samona from a distance

  is it true my daughter

  samonas head bowed in a convinc-
ing show of shame do not tell ryan
she begged he will beat me then
he will tell governor and i will be sent
away

the tanawains were more fearful
of deportation than of leprosy itself
and that night at a solemn conclave
held by head men from all the villages
it was agreed that on no account must
grenner be told about samona the
brousseau experience was reviewed in
detail an affliction resulting in the vic-
tim and all herblood kindred being
exiled from the island

  in this case the decree went out that
every lip must be sealed severe pen-
alties would be meted to anyone who
told grenner or ryan

  but will not ryan who lives with
her see it with his owrn eyes one of
the head men questioned

  she will conceal it from him with
fear and shame another said when
she can deceive him no longer she will
hurl herself into the sea

  then the chief head man laid down
a rigid tabu not one of them must
ever again approach samona she and
the house where she lived must be
shunned as one shuns untouchable
death

i	a-
copra



  hows trade ryan grenner in-
quired one evening a week later they
were drinking beer at the residency

  ryan frowned funny thing about
that he fretted i aint had a sack
come in for five or six days

  theyll be coming along with it
grenner assured him theyve got to
take it some place you know

  but that aint all worried ryan
there aint been a native in the store
lately not even for a pinch of nigger-
head

   as more days passed the inexplicable
lack of trade continued to mystify
ryan he made a trip through the vil-
lages presenting a quart of trade gin
to each head man the gifts were ac-
cepted politely and other gifts ten-
dered in return but still no copra came
to the logan brothers station

  one day he tried to hire a couple of
boys to repair the stations grass roof
but even an offer of a shilling a day
could not induce them to come

  ryan sweated and swore as he did
the work himself

  see here samona he complained
whats the matter with everybody
youd think we had a plague or some-
thing 

  it are so strange she murmured
i are not like to see you not happy
she uncorked a bottle of beer for him
and stood fanning away flies while he
drank it

  when he slipped an arm around her
waist and kissed her she endured it
with a smile i are see dave on beach
today she laughed he are more
unhappy than you but i do not care

  always her surest defense was to re-
mind him of daves wretchedness it
would endure in its most bitter pitch
ryan knew only so long as samona
seemed to continue living as the mis-
tress of this house only by respect-

  a-

ing her silly stubborn scruples could
he keep her here it was the best bar-
gain he could make in the meantime
she was keeping his house spotless and
serving him food and drink

  ryan was more of a drinker than a
lover but most of all he was an egoist
and it preened his ego to torment dave
weston

one day dave weston was aroused
from a lonely carousal to find a
customer in his store the man had
two sacks of copra and offered them in
trade

  dave burst into ironic laugher at his
own expense two measly sacks all
right when bills lugger comes i can
put one in his aft hatch and one for-
ward

  the man wanted twist tobacco dave
had hardly finished weighing it out
when three other tanawains entered
each had two sacks of copra sight
of the merchandise shocked dave
sober

  other islanders came and by sun-
down dave had five tons of copra in his
storeroom he went out and looked
toward ryans station the place was
deserted

  the same surprising deluge of trade
continued the next day dave was kept
jumping from one customer to another
and by night his back ached from the
exertion of handling heavy merchan-
dise he went to bed so tired that for
once he fell asleep without brooding
about samona

  while he slept red ryan stormed
into the residency look here gren-
ner he raged you get busy and do
something about this

  the threat in his eyes frightened
grenner he was at ryans mercy he
knew and had been for the last twelve
years ill do what i can


argosy

  what grenner did was not enough
during weeks which followed he im-
posed high-handed penalties against
every islander brought before him as
magistrate he hitched up his donkey
cart and made a round of the villages
announcing a new road to be built
through the jungle which would call for
a heavy tax of man power

  but to his chagrin the tanawains
submitted to both fines and taxes no
copra went to ryan all of it went to
weston

  look here red grenner said to
ryan i can stick one native and i
can stick ten of them but i cant hang
a rap on the whole population theres
a limit you know

  ryan cursed him theres a limit
to the time youll be out o jail he
threatened if i start talkin

  when the logan brothers boat
called in the lagoon a week later ryan
had no cargo for it captain jake
hammond in command was both as-
tonished and annoyed his immediate
assumption was that ryan had made
himself personally unpopular due to
some incident of cheating

  so hammond took an interpreter
and toured the villages he returned
to the station with an apology its not
you ryan they say you havent
cheated em its the station theres a
tabu on it the head men say they will
never trade here again

  why demanded ryan

  they dont say why but my ex-
perience is that when one of these tabus
gets plastered on a station its likely
to stick for good this is serious
ryan ill steam right over to apia and
report it to the logans

  as speedily as his boat could make
the round trip hammond was back
from apia the decree of logan broth-
ers infuriated ryan the logans were

canny scots and were taking no
chances so ryans straight salary had
been stopped hereafter he must operate
on a strictly commission basis

  thats the way outer islands com-
pany handles their man hammond
said so you get an even break
you cant put that over on me
ryan stormed i quit

  hammonds mouth tightened very
well you quit in that case im in-
structed to abandon the station

  he brought his crew ashore and pro-
ceeded to denude the stores fock in
trade all goods from the shelves were
transported to the ship

  you can have passage to apia if
you like hammond offered

  ryan nodded sullenly im taking
a girl with me that all right 

  sure hammond grinned fetch
her along

  but when ryan went looking for
samona she was nowhere to be found
there was no target for his temper ex-
cept grenner ill make a bum outa
you for letting me down grenner he
swore

  he went aboard and the ship slipped
out through the reef grenner wavered
between relief and terror he tried to
bolster a hope that ryan would think
better of it once he had time to cool
off

  near midnight grenner heard a
strange crackling and popping he
looked out into the dark and saw that
ryans empty store was a ball of fire
some of the tanawains he supposed
must have crept up to it with torches
why  why had the place been so mys-
teriously shunned and why was it now
being burned 

  grenner didnt know and didnt much
care his own troubles were enough
with a shrug he tossed down another
drink and went to bed
copra



vi

while it was still dark samona
came from the fringe of forest
and stood by the glowing coals which
had been ryans store she dropped
upon them one necklace of red glass
one pair of slippers from japan and one
javanese sarong

  then tropic dawn brought soft
shadows to the island and the people
of the main village were confounded to
see samona appear suddenly among
them her eyes were shining she had
never been more beautiful more vi-
brant with life

   she carried a basket on her arm the
head man stared for a moment then
shrieked a demand that she go in-
stantly away

  samona laughed joyously do not
have fear she cried i am not as you
hink come i prove it

  she dropped her tunic and stood
with her bare back exposed to them
the white spot was still there and they
shrank away

   but it is only the stain of the fruit
she explained i have put it there my-
self to drive evil from our land
from the basket she produced a
sponge and a can of oil then she
pleaded that the head man come to her
and be convinced with his own hands
he could scour the spot from her flesh

  at last he approached warily then
he took the sponge soaked it in the oil
and rubbed it across her back the
spot of white came off samona stood
brown and clean before them

  when they saw the miracle the vil-
lagers shrieked joyfully they danced
about samona embraced her made her
tell them everything the head man
could not control his mirth when she
exposed the deception on ryan he
sent messengers with the good news to
all other villages after commanding

the kava bowls to be brought forth he
ordered a great feast and celebration

  samona slipped away almost imme-
diately her ordeal as a living sacrifice
was now over and she could give her-
self back to the man she loved so she
ran breathlessly to tell dave her heart
was pounding tumultuously when she
burst in upon him he didnt see her at
first he was re-arranging his stock
getting ready for another big day of
trade

  shyness overcame samona when she
saw him there his face was set in
stern lines he seemed years older
and the change in him shocked her

  i are come back please she said
softly her voice made him whirl about
he stared in surprise and anger i are
come back she repeated

  daves eyes hardened so you came
back isnt that just too sweet of you
i make a failure and you go to ryan
now ryan fails and you come back to
me

  i have go to him so you make big
happy trades she pleaded i have do
no wrong please all the time i love

you

  get out of here dave shouted
his voice lashed her cruelly she re-
treated a step get out he yelled
again cant you see im busy

  desperately in a rush of hysteria
she told him all about it dave winced
when she told about the white spot she
bared her back then to let him see that
it was undefiled

  theres one spot on you that wont
come off he said bitterly you lived
with ryan

  when she denied it he wouldnt be-
lieve her clear out he said and
pushed her from the store

  she ran into the woods and fell there
sobbing stoney found her in a little
while he do not believe me
samona mourned
	argosy

  stonev hurried to dave see ere
dive dont be pig-eaded if it adnt
been fer er yerd be on the bloomin

beach

  but even when stoney corroborated
samonas story dave refused to be-
lieve all of it i dont want her at that
price he raged get out

tpntirely without competition
now dave continued to do heavy
trading in copra when skipper bill
came again there was a full cargo ready
for him the luggers crew came ashore
and stoney told them about samonas
ruse with ryan that yarnll be all
over these islands afore long skipper
bill chuckled ryan himself  hear it
an burst into flame

  a few days after the lugger pulled
out a new zealand gunboat dropped
anchor in the lagoon a tall gray man
came ashore from it with him came a
detail of marines

  the arrivals marched solemnly to
the residency when grenner saw them
his face went white ryan he guessed
had made good his threat

  the tall gray man produced creden-
tials announcing that he was harring-
ton h ash and that he had arrived to
replace grenner as resident governor
then a sergeant of marines stepped up
and arrested grenner on a charge
sworn to by ryan

  a few hours after the gunboat had
steamed away with grenner dave was
summoned before the new resident he
found ash both agreeable and intelli-
gent

  about that welsh murder wes-
ton he said over cocktails dash it
all its a disgrace to the service our
not clearing it up

  dave nodded too bad you werent
here when it happened he said

  incidentally announced ash
welshs uncle in sydney has offered

a thousand guinea reward for the mur-
derers capture dead or alive

  ryan did it of course dave as-
serted but it needs proving

   ash shook his head i rather doubt
that he thought because now that
ryan has told on grenner grenner
shouldnt hesitate to tell on ryan
and he doesnt

   no under severe grilling he insists
he knows nothing about the welsh
murder

what did ryan have on grenner 
ryan paid a sizable fine twelve
years ago when grenner was a magis-
trate in the samoans grenner simply
kept the fine for his own use

   ill help you all i can on the welsh
case dave promised

  during days which followed he was
too busy trading in copra to give the
matter much thought by immersing
himself in hard work he hoped that
he might in time forget samona

   but too often he caught sight of her
watching him wistfully from the beach
again and again her adoring face in-
truded upon his dreams he missed her
laughter and the soft embrace of her
arms he knew now that his only real
contentment was when she had shared
his life then he had had love with-
out success now he had success with-
out love-and he liked it least of all

skipper bills lugger came
smoking into the lagoon

  i can load you to the scuppers
dave reported

  get your gun ready dave bill
cautioned and look out for ryan
ryan echoed dave but hes not
here any more

  hes coming back bill warned
ominously and he swears hell feed
you to the sharks

   samonas leprosy deception bill ex-
plained had by now been bandied all
copra



over the south seas ryans heard
about it dave hes sore as a boiled
owl and he lays it all on you

  on me

  sure he figgers you done it he
dont credit the girl with enough savvy
to cook up a scheme like that so he
figgers you sent her to him

  dave flushed angrily i send her
does he think id put my own wife on
a spot like that

  hes judging you by himself son
you better watch out for him last i
heard he was tryin to buy a motor
launch in pepeete

  why a launch 

  so he can get away alone bill
explained after knocking you over
bill loaded his lugger with copra
from daves storeroom then before
weighing anchor he hunted up samona
and told her about ryans threat dave
wont take this seriously bill said so
you better keep a lookout for him

  at dawn samona climbed agilely to
the top of a tall palm in front of daves
station and hid herself there it was
so early that the fronds shielding her
were still wet with dew all day her
eyes scanned the sea anxiously no
launch came when night fell she
slipped to the ground in tired relief

  at the next dawn she climbed again
to the palm top each day she posted
herself there dave busy at the store
had no inkling of her vigilance nor of
her peril for there came gales which
lashed the palm tree to violent swaying
days came when torrents poured from
the sky drenching the girl and all but
washing her from her perch but more
often she sat there in torrid sunshine
with no breath of air stirring at such
times fatigue and lassitude occasionally
overcame her and she found herself
dozing often she opened her eyes and
started with relief to discover that no
launch was in sight

one sultry afternoon dave was re-
laxing on the stoop of his store
the beach was deserted in both direc-
tions there were no customers today
because the son of a head man was
being married at a far village

  relaxing in body dave put his mind
determinedly upon the enigma of
welshs murder he must think
straight he must remember every-
thing he had seen on that day he had
first come here with skipper bill

  to review what he had seen men-
tally and in proper balance he decided
to enter now as he had entered then

  he stood up mounted the veranda
steps what had he seen a table a
chair a half empty beer bottle

  entering the store he recalled having
seen cockroaches on the counters he
went on to the living quarters and into
the bedroom where welsh had slept
exactly he forced himself to recon-
struct that exhibit of horror welsh
face down on the bed with a copra
knife plunged through him   

  then in a flash a detail which had
vaguely impressed him at the time came
back to him there had been an entire
absence of blood a trained crime de-
tector would have noted it at once
but dave in his bewildered horror had
let the fact be blotted from his mind

  now he grasped it it meant that
welsh hadnt been killed here at all
and-if not here where

  that half finished bottle of beer on
the veranda welsh would hardly open
a beer without finishing it death dave
felt sure had stricken him as he sat
there drinking on the veranda

  dave hurried forward the table and
chair he saw occupied the same spot
a grass rug had been under the table
but so soiled that dave had long ago
thrown it away now he saw a small
jagged hole in the canvas back of the
chair a bullet hole


argosy

  his eyes scanned the sheet iron wall
back of it he found another hole there
he gouged into it with a knife pass-
ing through sheet iron the bullet had
penetrated only shallowly into the
wooden stud beyond welsh had been
shot not knifed dave retrieved the
bullet and weighed it on his palm a
rifle ball he judged he sighted from
one hole to the other and the line of
his vision pointed directly to ryans
store

  ryan he knew now had sniped
welsh at long range with a rifle be-
tween sundown and dark perhaps or
possibly by bright moonlight hours
later ryan must have worried because
it would look like the crime of a white
man so he had come here carried the
body into the bed plunged through the
course of the bullet hole a native knife

  it was neat dave admitted very
neat indeed

  dave with the death bullet in hand
went in to his counter there he found
a small apothecary scale used for weigh-
ing quinine he weighed the bullet it
scaled exactly two hundred and twenty-
seven grains

  somewhere in a litter on the shelves
was an old a f stoegers gun cata-
logue and hand-book he thumbed the
pages swiftly yes here it was two
hundred and twenty-seven grains was
the weight of a bullet used in an eight
millimeter mauser carbine

  elated dave sat down and wrote a
full report of his findings for resi-
dent ash his pen raced energetically
across the paper

  when he was done he went out with
it then as he stepped from the ve-
randa a harsh voice startled him he
looked up and saw ryan ten yards
awav aiming a carbine pointblank at
his head

  i come a long way to get you wes-
ton ryan rasped at him

   beyond him at the shore line dave
saw a twenty-foot motor launch no
one was in it clearly ryan had arrived
alone so that he could escape safely
after the fulfillment of his vengeance
dave himself was not armed he faced
ryan grimly bracing himself for the
shock of a bullet

  take a walk to the launch ryan
ordered i aint leavin you here
to be found-like they found welsh
see here ryan dave protested
you wont gain anything by-

  oh wont i  jeered ryan dont
make me laugh mister you had your
turn now its mine sent your wife
down to make a sucker outa me-while
she sneaked back to you every night
you-

  daves eyes widened then a bright
light broke over his face samona he
knew now had told him the truth he
had ryans own word for it

  get movin ryan barked you
got a date to feed the sharks

  his mouth was ugly in its triumphant
smile

  at close quarters in an open boat he
might have a chance dave decided
very well he agreed with a shrug
its your drop

  he raised his hands over his head
and started toward the launch ryan
followed with the carbine trained on
daves back

  the way led them under a tall palm
as ryan passed beneath it his shriek
make dave turn quickly he saw ryan
topple to the sand dave stared in
amazement a thing which never hap-
pens had happened a seven pound
cocoanut had dropped eighty feet to
strike ryan squarely on the skull the
strange shot from the sky crushed him
flat

  as he fell the carbine flew from his
hand
copra



  dave sprang to the weapon picked
it up and stood with it covering ryan
but ryan lay still dave kneeling by
him looked at his eyes and saw that
he was dead

  then samona came sliding down the
palm tree

  almost directly dave heard cart
wheels grinding on the sand a donkey
cart appeared from the forest with
resident governor ash driving it pre-
sumably the shriek from ryan had
turned him that way

  ash compressed his lips sternly at
the evidence-ryan dead dave with a
carbine in hand a native girl with big
frightened eyes hovering with her back
to the bole of a palm

  dave astonished him by handing over
the carbine a mushroomed bullet and
a written report compare those
dave said and youll know who killed
welsh

  welsh gaped ash youre talk-
ing about one homicide and im
looking at another he inclined his
head toward ryan did you kill
him 

  dave shook his head

  i didnt have a chance to he said
he had the drop on me sir

  at least not with the carbine ash

admitted with a frown for i heard
no shot he stooped to examine the
wound on ryans head then he saw
the cocoanut nearby with a reddish
stain on its hull

  this nut didnt fall he said
shrewdly its green and theres been
no wind

  he looked at daves heavy boots
then at the bare feet of samona she
threw the cocoanut from above didnt
she you saw her come down from the
tree didnt you

  when dave declined to answer the
resident became impatient see here
you were a witness the only witness
did she or didnt she kill this man with
a cocoanut

  where i came from dave an-
swered the law holds a man cant be
asked to testify against his wife

  he took samonas hand and looked
tenderly into the dark wells of her eyes
his other hand slipped back of her
head and pulled it to his shoulder

  as he regarded them severity dis-
solved from the residents face the
same law holds here young man he
conceded

  very well a hard lump came to
daves throat as he added gently
come samona lets go home

 on the boat deck

seftor armando moreles
leaned against the starboard rail
of the santa fortuna s promenade
deck and chuckled softly at anthony
blaisdells question

miss stoddard why do you look
for her so late in the trip in a few

flynn

old hellcat etc

hours we will he docked at new
orleans

  the promenade deck was dimly
lighted moreles slim spare figure
looked as dapper and handsome as it
ever had in the high-ceilinged govern-
ment offices in caracas and blaisdell
liked him no better

venezuela under gomez the old iron
dictator had never had a slipperier
official than moreles true gomez had
kept the small fry more or less in line
the caracas dungeons for thirty years
had been filled with wretches who dis-
pleased the old dictator but gomez was
dead moreles and others like him were
out and now lacking government
authority moreles was more than ever
smooth slippery and untrustworthy

  blaisdell regretted that he had
broached the matter miss stoddard
seems to be aboard under some other
name i thought you might know who
she was

  moreles chuckled again as he leaned
lazily against the rail he was a head
shorter than blaisdell his black mus-
tache was small and fastidious and
now as in the past he had the sly man-
ner of knowing forbidden secrets

  a letter a message came aboard at

a

new novel
of mystery at sea

pilottown moreles guessed you my
frien are with the delta corporation
concessions in south america are your
business now suddenly you wish to
find miss stoddard the delta corpo-
ration perhaps is interested in the
rancho del sol holdings

  i cant tell you blaisdell said
slowly and it was the truth he had
never until this moment heard of the
rancho del sol

  because if you are moreles said
slyly i think it is too late when
gomez died the rancho del sol was
lost others have had their eyes on it
senor stoddard died three years ago
only his daughter is left if gomez had
lived    but he is dead moreles
shrugged she was lucky perhaps to
get out of venezuela alive i have been
watching her on board she is still
frightened

  it seemed to blaisdell that moreles




argosy

relished the thought interesting he
commented carefully so she is
aboard 

  on the passenger list she is miss
reyes said moreles

   thanks said blaisdell with rather
more brusqueness than usual he left
before moreles pried further into the
matter

miss reyes was the black-haired
girl who had come aboard at
curacao having changed from one of
the smaller boats running from mara-
caibo the erect old fellow with the
british cavalrymans mustache had
accompanied her cunningham was his
name the two had kept more or less
to themselves uncle and niece so the
report went

  it had seemed peculiar to say the
least that dour old uncle stamped un-
mistakably with the union jack-and
the charming niece with the spanish
name the fine black hair and fresh
blond cheeks

  no wonder blaisdell thought he
hadnt been able to connect the reyes
girl with sam haughtons miss stod-
dard

   miss anita stoddard of venezuela is

   aboard place yourself unreservedly at her

    disposal

  when the pilot came aboard at pilot-
town an envelope from sam haughton
had contained that pithy order and
haughton as president of the delta
corporation would expect his orders to
be carried out

   from the passenger list blaisdell got
the stateroom number of miss consuela
reyes and knocked on her door late
as it was she was not inside blaisdell
searched the promenade deck the salon
and finally from a steward he ques-
tioned got track of her

  miss reyes i think i saw her

going up on the boat deck some time
ago sir

  the boat deck was unlighted
deserted most of the passengers had
turned in early the santa fortuna
would be docked by daybreak the low
banks of the mississippi were dark
blurs across the water the deep smooth
sweep of the river had its old magic
blaisdell breathed deep of the fresh
swampy smell of the land south
america he thought as he walked
slowly along the dark deck had its
thrills and satisfactions the hill-girt
bay of rio by moonlight for instance
the great christ of the andes lonely
majestic in the white emptiness of a
winter dawn but this last leg of the
trip home was always best

  blaisdell paused at the corner of a
deckhouse and stared toward the dim
dark levee bank across the water and
a moment later a slender figure moved
hurriedly around the corner of the deck
house and stumbled against him she
gasped as blaisdell caught her she
wrenched away

   blaisdell sensed her fright as he said
sorry-ive been looking for you
miss stoddard im anthony blaisdell
of the delta corporation

che stopped she was startled un-
 decided how do you know who
i am why are you looking for me at
-at this time of the night

  blaisdell explained mr haughton
sent word aboard at pilottown that i
was to place myself at your disposal a
chap named moreles whom ive done
business with at caracas told me you
were miss stoddard a steward
directed me up here and now blais-
dell said cheerfully i am at your
disposal

  she drew a sharp deep breath blais-
dell could have sworn it was a sigh of
santa fortuna



relief no doubt of it-she had been
gripped by panic when she came hur-
riedly around the corner of the deck
house her face was all but invisible in
the shadows tony blaisdell remem-
bered how striking how pretty her face
was he had guessed her to be about
twenty-one small slender and there
was a bit of magic in her low voice as
she said mr haughton must have
got my letter i didnt expect anything
like this and at this time could-
could you stay here with me for a few
minutes 

  as long as you please

  he saw that she was only giving him
part of her attention her head was
turned her thoughts seemed to be on
that part of the deck from which she
had come

  something frightened you

  yes she said and hesitated i
saw a man who should not be aboard
we checked the passenger list  

  i see tony blaisdell said al-
though he didnt at all why should
this man frighten you

  she said slowly i think he may try
to kill me

  the wind was cool and sweet off the
lowlands beyond the deep river the
deck pulsed vaguely under their feet as
the ship drove against the sweep of the
current and this slender girl stood
motionless beside him on the peaceful
deck and spoke calmly of death
where is he who is he

  he was coming up from the lower
deck i saw him in the light at the top
im sure he is up here sprne where look-
ing for me

  ill have a look he left her and
walked back aft along the port side
glancing behind each big canvas-
covered lifeboat chocked along the rail
queer he thought how a few words
could alter the aspect of a night now

the dark river seemed lonely mysteri-
ous the deck was a nest of shadows
capable of concealing anything and yet
-it was hard to believe she could be
right not murder-not here on the
santa fortuna tonight

  perhaps she had seen some restless
passenger coming up for a stroll a
word to the man a match to a cigarette
to reveal his face-

  blaisdell stepped around the bow of
the third lifeboat-and a dark form
moved in front of him suddenly
quickly threateningly

  blaisdell sensed the coming blow
too late he tried to dodge back-and
the fist smashed against the side of his
head drove him reeling against the
stern of the next lifeboat flashes of
light spun in his eyes-the night
whirled   

  blaisdell threw up his left arm a
smash on the forearm drove numbness
to the shoulder he lurched to the rail
dizzy sick weak his attacker ap-
parently was using a blackjack what-
ever the weapon was the goal was
murder

  danger cleared blaisdells head he
twisted away from the rail by luck
dodging another clubbed blow-and
struck hard at the dark blob of a face

  lips a mustache teeth ground under
his knuckles he felt the other man go
back on his heels long arms reached
out and caught blaisdell swung him
around wrestled him against the
rail 

  strong astonishingly strong those
arms were but blaisdell was taller
and heavier than the other against the
rail he managed to brace himself to
swing the man up and around against
the rail they were both gasping
straining the man tore loose-and
grunted as he struck again while blais-
dell tried to dodge

chapter ii

and below   

tony blaisdell heard a voice
say hes coming around a
flashlight was glaring in his face his
head hurt when he moved

  take that light away help me up
hands helped him to his feet as run-
ning steps came up a voice said the
doctor will be here in a minute sir
the familiar voice of second mate
cochrane asked solicitously can you
make it on your feet mr blaisdell
the flashlight showed the second
mate two seamen and the stoddard
girl the light touched her face she
was pale blaisdells legs were rubbery
one of the seamen was supporting him
he was he saw still between the two
lifeboats

  im all right he said with an
effort

  cochrane tall blond taciturn spoke
grimly who was it

  anita stoddard explained when
you didnt come back i went to the

bridge

  blaisdell answered her wryly well
-i found the fellow you were right
yes-i knew i was

  the ships surgeon simpson
hustled up wearing a checked dressing
gown and carrying his small black bag
well well whats this the head
eh lets have a look-just bend over
here by the light

  the doctor fussed expertly for a
minute or two not a thing to worry
about he announced cheerfully you
must have a hard head young man i
can draw the edges of this cut together
wont even have to stitch it not the
slightest danger of a fracture im cer-
tain what happened fall against the
lifeboat 

met a blackjack blaisdell replied

shortly rubbing his numbed aching
arm

  second mate cochrane was still grim
ive sent for the captain the pursers
coming- here he is now

  mr starbuck the purser was a
slender pallid youngish man who had
been on tropical runs for years but he
still looked as if he rarely saw the sun-
light hastily buttoning the front of
his coat he hurried along in the dark
his eyes peering molelike at them

  miss reyes tells me we have a man
aboard who isnt on the passenger list
cochrane told him he must have
come aboard at curacao hes about
five feet four or five small black mus-
tache-swarthy skin-looks spanish
but hes not calls himself obrian a
powerful fellow with long arms do
you place him

  no-o-no pm sure not starbuck
replied nervously ive seen no one
who answers that description

  blaisdells head still throbbed pain-
fully  but his mind was cleared any
chance of him being a stowaway
the second mate answered that posi-
tively wed have found him by now
we make a routine-and thorough-
stowaway search before entering the
states

  that leaves the crew said blais-
dell

  no one in the deck department fits
him cochrane stated flatly

  the engine room then

  ill have to see the chief engineer
about that he runs things below
he assaulted a passenger mr
cochrane growled the captain will
want to see you mr blaisdell youre
going to the doctors office i suppose
blaisdell said miss reyes will want
to see her uncle about this ill take her
down then ill come to your office
doctor
santa fortuna



she did not protest blaisdell guessed
she wanted to be alone with him
and when they were out of earshot she
said in distress i was afraid some-
thing like this would happen im sorry
you did it i shouldnt have let you
id do it again you know but id
take a gun who is this obrian
they were in the faint light at the
top of the companion steps she looked
at him quickly probing theres so
much behind it-so much i dont know
-im not sure about ive heard he
calls himself obrian he was pointed
out to me in maracaibo i was sure he
didnt see me-either of us we were
probably being watched all the time
by whom blaisdell insisted and
why did that fellow try to kill me i
was a stranger to him

  she passed over the first two ques-
tions-deliberately it seemed-and knit
her brows as she said he must have
known you were looking for him
that hardly calls for murder

  i have been trying to guess why
she looked puzzled-and very lovely
with her pallor her earnestness her
quiet voice intrigued him her english
had the faintest subtle twist as if the
ghost of another tongue lurked behind
she did not use slang she spoke pre-
cisely as one might who had learned
english in another country

  hadnt you better tell me all about
it

  i wont bother you tomorrow i
must see mr haughton what he ad-
vises i will do thank you for coming
down with me

  she offered her hand gravely plainly
expecting him to leave tony blaisdell
grinned down at her

  perhaps your-uncle will see it dif-
ferently now that ive had this much
to do with the matter

  she shrugged and without comment

knocked on the stateroom door my
uncle she said will feel as i do

  it occurred to blaisdell as he watched
her that they had both hesitated
slightly before the word uncle her
knock on the stateroom door was not
answered she rapped again and blais-
dell absently glancing down saw some-
thing which made him frown and
quickly reach for the door knob

  the door was not locked it moved
inward to his push

  please blaisdell said swiftly he
stepped in front of her and pushed on
the door something inside something
on the floor kept the door from open-
ing more than a few inches blaisdell
was barely able to squeeze inside

  the stateroom was lighted-and he
took a lurching step to avoid a body on
the floor

 a nthony blaisdell was no
stranger to violence out-of-the-
way corners of south america where
a junior partner in the delta corpora-
tion was often sent offered moments of
trouble but the quiet in this small
stateroom held a gruesome threat it
was as if death had slipped in furtively
and was still lurking in the corners

  who is it swift alarm was in
anita stoddards voice she stood in
the doorway a moment later her tight
frightened whisper cut through the
quiet madre de dios-hes dead
her small oval face had the frozen im-
mobility of great shock-but not of
grief her eyes wide dark under
darker lashes were filled with fright
and horror-but no tears

  she shivered as she looked down

  the old man-old cunningham stiff
and british-lay there clad in a dress-
ing gown hastily belted over thin paja-
mas he lay on one hip his legs drawn
up his shoulders twisted down on the


argosy

rug his face stared up his arms were
outflung he must have fallen so after
staggering back a step from the door
and collapsing

  the blood seeped from a small hole
in the left temple an ugly smear of
crimson stained the cheek below as if
a hand had gone convulsively to the
spot the left hand-the hand on that
side-was streaked with crimson

  they couldnt have done this to him
for helping me

  pity in blaisdell went to meet her
they two were suddenly alone the ship
might not have been about them but
death was bringing them together as
nothing else could have done

  blaisdell said the thing that was in
his mind he had to know he isnt
your uncle is he

  the next moment he jumped to catch
her she had slipped down the edge of
the door to the floor she was light
limp in his arms as he carried her to the
bed

   blaisdell put his lighter to a cigarette
his hand was not steady he swore
softly and turned to the door and
pressed the bell for a steward

  blaisdell met the steward outside the
door theres a dead man in there
notify the captain get the doctor ill
wait here

  the steward backed away a step his
face had the unbelieving astonishment
of one whose well ordered routine had
suddenly crashed about his ears yes
sir he backed away another step and
turned hastily and scuttled away

  anita stoddard was still unconscious
when dr simpson arrived captain
mcrory followed - and the purser
stewards seamen the passageway out-
side the stateroom filled rapidly

  mcrory shouldered into the room
stepping gingerly over the body what
the devils this murdered who did

it he glared from the body to blais-
dell and stabbed a blunt forefinger at
the bed whats the matter with her
what are you doing in here

  blaisdell had sailed with mcrory
before

  i brought miss-reyes down to see
her uncle blaisdell explained coolly
we found him like this she fainted
im afraid its up to you captain

  dr simpson turned from the bed
ill have her out of this in a minute
the captain chewed his thick lower
lip his broad forehead ridged in a
scowl his eyes under heavy brows that
were weathered almost white stared
helplessly at the body glanced about the
stateroom settled again on blaisdell

well havent you an idea after
what happened up on the boat deck
not the slightest idea said blais-
dell have you found the chap who
jumped me

  he seems to have shipped aboard at
curacao under the name of jones
captain mcrory declared the chiei
engineer took him on as a coal passer
when one of the regular crew didnt
report back to the ship this fellow-
obrian or jones-was waiting on the
dock for a job the ships being
searched from forepeak to shaft alley
for him the captain knelt by the
body this would have to happen on
my ship and on the last night

  its queer no one seems to have heard
the shot blaisdell mused

  dr simpson dissolved a large tablet
in a glass of water he bent over the
bed now murmuring with false cheer-
fulness drink this

  anita stoddard sat up with the doc-
tors help dropping her feet to the
floor she drank obediently she was
trembling as if some tropical fever had
driven an icy chill to the marrow of her
bones
santa fortuna



  captain mcrory planted himself by
the bed young lady what do you
know about this

  i-i dont know who killed him
she stammered

  you seemed to know that fellow on
the boat deck you will tell me every-
thing you know please

  she looked past the captain to blais-
dell misery was in her look and a
silent appeal

  you dont have to answer you
know you havent done anything
dont let him bully you mcrory
glared blaisdell smiled and said miss
stoddards in no condition to be ques-
tioned certainly not in here doctor
what about it

  i think miss reyes had better go
to her stateroom doctor simpson de-
cided ill take her

  very well ill see you when youre
feeling better captain mcrory in-
formed her brusquely

  it seemed to blaisdell that as she
went out the glance she gave him was
grateful anything more he asked
the captain politely

  mcrory gave him an annoyed look
ill have questions later youll be wall-
ing to answer them i suppose 
naturally

chapter iii

ancient history

blaisdell had to push his way
through the shocked and ner-
vously whispering crowd that had
gathered outside the door starbuck the
purser more pallid than ever nervously
inquired what is it sir another-
the captain said blaisdell will
tell you he brushed past starbuck
as he came clear of the group about the
door blaisdell saw dapper little ar-
mando moreles leaning against the cor-

ridor wall and moreles face wore a
furtive eager look there was a sly
air of tension of watchful waiting
about him that suggested undue
interest

  blaisdell stopped

  so my frien-there was trouble
after all she had reason to look
frightened

  did she blaisdell said what
makes you think this had anything to
do with her

  they moved along the passage out of
earshot moreles showed his teeth his
eyes were bright with sly knowledge
your head moreles said how is
your head that i suppose had noth-
ing to do with her

 who knows said blaisdell
quien sabef you get about-you kept
track of things moreles venezuela
isnt such a big country when youre on
the government underground and
foreigners are involved what dyou
know about a fellow named obrian
moreles shrugged nothing-i as-
sure you-nothing so much has hap-
pened since gomez died too many of
us have been trying to remain alive
there were so many scores to settle
who is this obrian

  he was in maracaibo

  and i came aboard at la guaira
said moreles with another shrug as if
that settled the matter but it didnt
the furtive eagerness the sly tension
were still there tell me-they say
this old man was shot in the head for
why was it done

  quien sabef blaisdell repeated
he noticed that moreles searched his
face as if trying to weigh the amount
of truth in the reply

  there were questions blaisdell
wanted to ask he put them off as dr
simpson returned hurriedly along the
passage


argosy

  everything all right blaisdell
asked

  yes yes shes quite calm re-
signed as it were the doctor replied
youre waiting to have your head
dressed eh im afraid i cant get to
it right now a little later and simp-
son bustled toward cunninghams door

  blaisdell had forgotten about his
head with mild surprise he realized it
was still painful he left moreles there
and took with him recollection of the
mans sly knowing amusement more-
les knew where he was going

  anita stoddard opened her stateroom
door the moment he knocked her eyes
were slightly red she had blaisdell
guessed wept but now she was sober
calm and as she closed the doo- she
said thank you for getting me out
of there i was not able to answer many
questions

  blaisdell looked down at her he
wanted to take her hand instead he
asked feeling better now

  she read his mind you have ques-
tions 

theyll be asked anyway blaisdell
reminded her and in a way its my
duty you know ive had my orders
such comforting orders i shall
always be grateful to sam haughton
you know him

  surprisingly she said i have never
seen him he was a friend of my fathers
-long ago i wrote him a letter before
i left rancho del sol i was not certain
it would get through to him but it
did

  she sat on the bed blaisdell took a
chair she accepted the cigarette he
offered her hand he noticed was
steady he liked that he liked many
things about her including her speech
shadowed so unconsciously by another
tongue you need help he said

  she nodded her eyes-dark blue

eyes with long lashes-sought his face
with hurt and bewilderment

  i do not see why he was killed here
-killed this last night of the trip why
was he killed at all he was going
north to chicago in two days i would
not have seen him again because he
helped me a little they killed him
they said blaisdell who
but i do not know mr blaisdell
she said helplessly

  the rancho del sol-what about
it

  my estate left to me by my
father

  and theres trouble over it

  my father was a friend of the
president gomez she said slowly he
was a young man my father when he
came to venezuela he married a reyes
-my mother but that was after
gomez had favored him-after rancho
del sol was started it grew oil wa
found on some of our land taxes were
heavy-but there was enough to pay
them easily i was born in washington
i am an american-but a venezuelan
too i stayed on the rancho del sol
after my father died there was no
trouble until gomez died then sud-
denly what was secure was not secure
friends of the old president had little
protection many of them were killed
others were exiled but i was an
american it was not so easy on the
rancho del sol are cattle coffee and
oil and only i was there to hold it
against those who wanted it there
were new laws new regulations heavy
fines taxes trouble much trouble my
money was tied up in the banks some
of my people were killed it was con-
veyed to me that it would be difficult
for me to leave the country-unless the
rancho del sol was first sold to the
new syndicate which held the estates
next to us

	a-
santa fortuna



  the usual squeeze said blaisdell
he could visualize all that the delta
corporation with its concessions had
often been up against that sort of thing
the old crowd out-a new crowd in
with new pockets to be lined and
washington a long way off and slow
to act-if at all more than one man
had seen a lifetime of work vanish in
such chaos more than one man had
stayed and tried to fight back some
won out-some didnt too many who
stayed died in one way or another
accidents happened   

nita stoddard smiled faint-
ly squeeze yes-that is a good
word it was a very tight squeeze
finally there was only one hope i must
get to new orleans and i had been
told i must not leave the district mara-
caibo was a long way off she looked
at blaisdell gravely one does not
laugh at such things back from the
coast-when everything is unsettled
right blaisdell agreed so cun-
ningham helped you leave

  he too was a friend of my
fathers she said soberly he knew
the danger i think perhaps better than
i for he had talked with others he did
suggest that i take my mothers name
and travel with him to maracaibo as
his niece and then on to new orleans
under his protection

  did you have any trouble

  none although in maracaibo mr
cunningham was certain we were being
watched from a second story window
he showed me this man obrian waiting
on the corner he had seen obrian at
merida drinking with two members of
the syndicate who want the rancho del
sol obrian had much money and was
spending it freely yes-we were sure
then we had been followed but obrian
did not come to curacao on the boat we

 	a-

took and when the santa fortuna left
curacao i was sure there would be no
trouble obrian was not aboard and
then suddenly tonight i saw him com-
ing up on the boat deck-and i knew he
must have been hidden aboard and
must be looking for me to me it
meant danger and i was right but
why did he wait until tonight and
why was mr cunningham killed she
cried

  revenge for helping you out of the
country blaisdell frowned tell me
you dont intend to go back do you
but of course she said positively
her eyes hardened everything my
father left is there they shall not take
it from me they think perhaps i
have run away-but i am going back
jvith more money

  youre not by any chance going to
make a deal with the delta corpora-
tion  blaisdell asked and go back
with sam haughtons backing

  she shook her head no-i had not
thought of that i have another way a
better way i will be able to do it by
myself

  how

  she stood up pressed out her ciga-
rette in an ash tray and looked at him
gravely perhaps i am not sure about
that myself i will not talk about it
but you know now what has
happened

  blaisdell stood up and i dont
know whats going to happen he said
if they dont find this obrian aboard
then what he didnt go to all this
trouble merely because cunningham
helped you you dont think this is the
end of it

  how do i know she leaned for-
ward troubled urgent the police will
ask many questions i do not want to
tell them much it will be bad will you
remember


argosy

  blaisdell grinned at her she was not
so helpless after all she had spunk-
backbone-a head that was working
as far as im concerned he pro-
mised you havent told me anything
what you tell anyone else is your own
affair now hadnt you better get some
sleep and-keep your door locked
i will she promised obediently
good night-and thank you mr
blaisdell

  blaisdells thoughts were far from
optimistic as he closed the door behind
lim one murder he knew hadnt
nded the violence there had to be
nore of it cunninghams death had
accomplished nothing final cunning-
lams death had-blaisdell was certain
-only paved the way for something
else	

  at that moment a door just ahead of
him opened armando moreles stepped
out into the corridor-and looked both
surprised and chagrined to see blaisdell
there moreles hesitated as if wishing
to step back inside and close his door

that moment of hesitation allowed
blaisdell to come abreast of the
door he saw a woman standing inside
and recognized her she was a mrs
simpson who had come aboard at
curacao with her husband a rather
leggy young woman with a deeply
bronzed fine face and somewhat jaded
blond hair she ran to low-heeled shoes
and interminable walks about the deck
blaisdell recalled that he had seen anita
stoddard talking to her once or twice
and now moreles was with her

  another time it would have meant
nothing but now blaisdell felt the first
surge of sharp dawning suspicion he
sensed that moreles was chagrined at
having been seen here and for that
there was a reason

  moreles fell into step beside him

nervously putting a cigarette between
his lips blaisdell wanted to look back
but did not certain mrs simpson was
lingering in the doorway looking after
them

  tell me my frien have they found
this man do they know any more
suppose we go and see blaisdell
suggested casually and he asked just
as casually you havent any more
ideas about it have you 

  moreles gave him a quick look he
was almost visibly examining the ques-
tion from all angles

  i have one idea he said slyly the
delta corporation will soon have an
interest in the rancho del sol
perhaps 

  perhaps said blaisdell carelessly
and from the corner of his eye he saw
that moreles looked satisfied and he
asked who else is after the estate
ah said moreles how should i
know one hears rumors-but what
are they rumors do not interest you
senor blaisdell

  they might said blaisdell

  moreles chuckled then i will listen
for rumors

  blaisdell left moreles and went up
to the captains suite mcrory looked
up and nodded tersely

  i was just going to send for you
blaisdell have a drink there on the
tray

  blaisdell took the bottle and un
screwed the cap found any trace of
this fellow obrian

  still searching he stated  lie
brought a cheap suitcase aboard it
isnt under his bunk in the firemans
focsle where he kept it he was on the
four-to-eight watch he dressed him-
self after coming off duty and went out
on deck he seems to have disappeared
then-until you met him on the boat
deck that was just before midnight
santa fortuna



  blaisdell tossed down the whisky
neat

  this is pretty serious blaisdell
mcrory said you realize that since
miss reyes seemed to know obrian
its going to be difficult for her

  i think her part is simple and easily
explained said blaisdell cunning-
ham pointed obrian out to her in
maracaibo as a suspicious character
when he appeared on the boat deck she
was sure he didnt belong there i hap-
pened along she told me i went off
to look for him-found him-he
jumped me and when i didnt come
back she reported the matter to the
bridge

  sounds simple mcrory admitted
his bushy white brows knit in a scowl
but that doesnt explain the murder
of cunningham nothing was dis-
turbed in the room

  im not surprised the man who
killed him didnt go inside hed have
moved the body from the door have
you located anyone who heard a shot
no said mcrory no one he
sighed this will be out of my hands
when we dock therell be more trouble
coming when the police come aboard
im sure of it said blaisdell id
better see the doctor and turn in good
night

an insistent rapping awoke blaisdell
in the morning a stewards voice
answered his sleepy response the
captain wishes you in his suite sir
coming blaisdell yawned then
memory wiped his mind awake and he
came to his feet with a rush the ships
engines were silent it was as if the life
had gone out of the great steel hull-as
if the santa fortuna herself had died

  blaisdell smiled grimly as he stepped
to the port death was on his mind
his watch showed the hour as seven-

thirty through the porthole he made
out the gray front of a dock shed he
looked out and saw people moving down
there on the dock but they wrere not
passengers inside the dock shed he
could see the customs men standing
idle the investigation of cunning-
hams death must be holding up every-
thing

  when he went out on deck two uni-
formed policemen were standing by the
gangway head the captains door was
open a voice not mcrorys answered
his knock are you blaisdell

   i am blaisdell said and entered

  three men were in the captains
room they were smoking cigarettes
all three of them eyed him with pro-
fessional estimation

  the nearest one said captain mc-
rory had to leave have a seat he
smiled im noel hoffman of the
federal bureau of investigation this
is mr metcalf and mr dixon from
headquarters

  the two detectives nodded they
were both short metcalf was chunky
dixon was slender and older by some
years gray was cropping out in his
black hair

  hoffman was the youngest of the
three younger by a year or so than he
himself was blaisdell guessed he was
trim unobtrusive but once hed got
your attention you realized that there
was a tremendous lot of keen energy
and cold controlled intelligence hidden
underneath blaisdell respected liked
him at once

  so the f b i is interested
in this blaisdell commented taking
the chair

  the department has jurisdiction
over crimes on the high seas and
while the santa fortuna was not
exactly on the high seas she had not
docked when this man was killed   


argosy

captain mcrory tells us you were at-
tacked on the boat deck last night

  i was said blaisdell have they
found the man who did it

 not a trace he apparently
vanished

  then he went overboard blaisdell
said his eyes narrowed at the implica-
tion he went over the side while the
ship was bucking the current at full
speed which means he had to clear the
propeller by a miracle-and then swim
to shore and in the middle of the
night with the current running like it
is with everything from possible alli-
gators and alligator gars to sucks and
whirls and logs waiting to drag him
under that calls for another miracle
once ashore he had to get somewhere
in a hurry which in itself is no small
feat so far down the river blaisdell
leaned forward do you think he left
the ship that way-and got ashore 
he isnt aboard said hoffman
and a neat guess youve made the
bow lookout remembers a curious light
on the east bank about that time per-
haps a flashlight it went on and off
several times he forgot it until he was
questioned this morning

  the idiot should have reported it
blaisdell said the road along the
river from fort jackson could have
been blocked by radio blaisdell went
on thoughtfully someone had made
careful plans to the smallest detail-
even to the santa fortunas passing
that particular spot when she did-and
the plans clicked perfectly

  even to killing cunningham
hoffman suggested

  yes

  hoffman was not apparently speak-
ing for the two city detectives but
blaisdell had the feeling the three of
them had talked all this over and had
left to hoffman the task of questioning
him

  interesting hoffman murmured
how did you happen to be  the boat
deck with miss-er-reyes at pre-
cisely the time to meet him

vi	hey knew her right name blais-
dell wondered how much more
they knew that was a good lead-up
im afraid i cant match it miss reyes
ran into me in the dark she had seen
obrian couldnt understand how he
was aboard and was upset she told
me i looked for the fellow-and found
him blaisdell finished ruefully touch-
ing his sore scalp

  he tried to kill you

  i thought so at the time

  yet he left you there on the deck
when he could have dumped you over
the side

  that has been puzzling me im also
puzzled as to how a shot was fired at
cunningham without anyone hearing
it

  hoffman drummed his fingers lightly
on the chair arm a weblev air pistol
was used at least we think it was a
webley from the shape of the pellet
that was recovered its an english
make there would be no sound
could an air pistol have made such
a brutal hole

  i looked up the ballistics hoffman
said the  webley pellets have a
 muzzle velocity at a foot or two
its a wonder more damage wasnt
done hoffman leaned forward
what do you know about miss
reyes 

  the quickly veiled look of interest in
hoffmans eyes wasnt necessary to put
blaisdell on his guard why should i
know anything about her i had never
seen her before she came aboard at cu-
racao i didnt speak to her before we
met on the boat deck last night
hoffmans cigarette had died out he
santa fortuna



got to his feet and dropped it in an
ash receiver

  wed like to know more about her
than she seems willing to tell he
stated

  what did she tell

  hoffmans thin smile might have
meant anything probably not nearly
so much as shes already told you
blaisdell flushed angrily

  what makes you think shes con-
fided in me at all he demanded ive
already told you i never saw-

  yes of course sorry thank you
mr blaisdell passengers will be going
ashore shortly by the way youre with
the delta corporation i believe an
executive 

  one of the juniors-very junior
said blaisdell standing up

  you can be reached at your office
i suppose

   a telephone call will do blaisdell
said sorry i cant help you more
gentlemen

  metcalf the chunky headquarters
detective spoke for the first time his
voice was a husky drawl you did
pretty well the ghost of a satisfied
grin was on metcalfs face

olaisdell carried that memory
away the grin bothered him he
had an annoying impression that he had
been on trial and had made a poor
showing too late now to do anything
about it he went in search of anita
stoddard

  her stateroom door was standing
ajar a woman was speaking inside i
guess this is all arch

  the brisk voice was not anita stod-
dards blaisdell hesitated-and a man
opened the door and looked startled
and annoyed to see blaisdell standing
there

  blaisdell kept his face blank as he

recognized the sun-tanned well built

husband of the leggy mrs simpson
mrs simpson had just spoken beyond
the door on the floor inside were three
traveling bags anita stoddard was not
in the stateroom

  simpson said you startled me if
youre looking for miss reyes shes
gone ashore with the police to inspect
some rogues gallery pictures she left
suddenly and asked mrs simpson to
pack her bags

  is she under arrest

  no of course not why should she
be

  you never can tell in matters like
this said blaisdell shes coming
back i suppose

  i dont think so simpson said
she asked us to put her bags through
the customs and take them to the lee-
land hotel where were stopping
simpson was holding a straight-
stemmed brier pipe he pulled on it a
second and said nasty business eh
hows your head this morning
doing nicely thanks miss reyes
is fortunate to have friends to help
her

  were glad to do what we can
simpson nodded any message we can
deliver

   i dont believe so thanks

   blaisdell crossed the ship to his own
stateroonvhe was wondering about
the simpsons you met their type about
the world polished competent restless
you couldnt tell much about them but
because moreles seemed to know them
they would probably be worth keeping
an eye on

   grigsby the bandy-legged little room
steward squashed out a cigarette as
blaisdell entered his cabin and smiled
sheepishly just catching a bit of rest
sir and wondering when your bagsd
be ready


argosy

  have them for you in a jiffy

  so many passengersve been asking
when they can go ashore i got fair
tired of answering

  blaisdell nodded from the corner of
his eye he saw that grigsby was shift-
ing nervously from one foot to the
other the little steward had something
on his mind

  i suppose the detectives questioned
you

  grigsby shook his head not yet
you wouldnt be knowing sir if theyre
finding who killed the old gentleman
no luck yet i guess why

  i was just wondering sir   
out with it grigsby whats on
your mind

  i dont like to talk indeed i dont
sir if you hadnt been almost done in
by that fellow from the engine room
gang i wouldnt say nothing but see-
ing as you spoke with the police this
morning i thought-

  lets have it said blaisdell serious
now whats worrying you

  grigsby swallowed im not one to
put suspicion on an innocent man mr
blaisdell but i just wondered if the
detectives were showing any curiosity
about mr moreles

  what about him

  but before grigsby could answer
they were frozen by the sound of a
womans scream that knifed along the
passage she screamed again as blais-
dell swung to the door jerked it open

  she was running toward him crying
sobbing-it was one of the steward-
esses she would have fled past blais-
dell if he had not blocked her way
caught her arms stopped her

what is it he demanded sharply
her eyes were wide with horror she
was almost incoherent as she cried
wildly theres another one hes
dead i walked in and didnt know he

was there hes on the bed his
tongues sticking out his eyes are pop-
pingoh its awful

  blaisdell shook her steady wrho
is it

  she wailed that south american
that man with the little black mus-
tache i think im going to faint  

chapter iv

lock the barn door

rigsby the bandy-legged little
steward stood in the stateroom
doorway with a gray pallor of dazed
uncertainty on his face blaisdell thrust
his limp burden into grigsbys arms
here take her

  whatll i do with her grigsby
stammered

  put her in your pocket throw her
out the porthole hide her under the
bed what the devil do i care what you
do with her blaisdell retorted-and
was off down the passage with long
strides

  once in a lifetime a thing like this
came along piling disaster on disaster
a thing that topped the unbelievable
with the impossible-that knocked a
situation into a cocked hat and scattered
the fragments irretrievably

  cunninghams murder had been bad
enough the stage had been set for it
no one had been expecting it but this
-this last murder-was a slap a chal-
lenge a dare from fate

  moreles was dead useless to imagine
that the stewardess could have meant
anyone else

  the little south american had a
stateroom near the end of the passage-
way and that moreles could afford the
price of a good cabin was as good a
pointer as any to the devious channels
of graft he had explored while serving
the old dictator
santa fortuna



  the door was closed terrified hys-
terical the stewardess had slammed it
as she fled but she had left her key in
the spring lock blaisdell opened the
door and stopped moreles body was
there on the bed in boldly striped blue
silk pajamas it was lying at an angle
across the bed his eyes were bulging
popping his tongue was black his face
congested and he was dead-dead for
hours

  blaisdell knew it was death before he
reached the bed and touched the stiff
cold wrist armando moreles had not
died pleasantly a white silk handker-
chief twisted tightly encircled his
swollen throat like a savage mockery of
other handkerchiefs worn in the late
afternoon tennis games to which more-
les had been always hurrying from his
curacao office white teeth clamped on
the dark swollen tongue as if in death
the dapper little man was biting back
the secrets which had lurked in the
crooked channels of his mind one pal-
lid lid was half down over a bulging
eye giving the effect of a macabre
wink as if in dying moreles knew he
was taking with him one last secret-
his greatest secret-the secret of his
death

  two bags had been opened the con-
tents were scattered recklessly on the
floor locker drawers were open the
pillow cases were off the mattress had
been lifted up dropped carelessly back
so that it overhung at the head of the
bed

  holy cow that was mendenhall
a fleshy broker who had boarded the
santa fortuna at rio de janeiro men-
denhall looked slightly ill as he regarded
the body on the bed and ive been
next to that ever since i got up he
gulped

  thats right-you have the next
cabin havent you blaisdell said

crisply you didnt hear any sounds in
here three or four hours ago did you
mendenhall was passing a handker-
chief over his pudgy face he shook his
head silently

  a crowd was gathering in the pas-
sage breathless exclamations shuffling
feet questions back and forth were
growing louder by the moment
through that came the burly broad-
shouldered figure of one of the two
patrolmen who had been guarding the
head of the gangway

  dead huh whos dead they
could have heard that woman yelling
clear to canal street    who did
that

  try guessing you may get an an-
swer where are those detectives who
were up in the captains quarters
theyll be here the whole shipll
be here say- whore you anyway
mister

  blaisdell was suddenly angry irri-
tated this second killing was bad
enough but here he was for the second
time one of the first persons at the scene
of murder

  a booming voice of authority rang
along the passage as captain mcrory
ordered the people out of the way then
mcrory was there and hoffman the
department of justice man and met-
calf the short chunky headquarters
detective with his partner dixon

  mcrory red-faced and bull-like took
one look at the bed and blew up an-
other one what kind of a jinx has hit
this ship

  a two-legged jinx said blaisdell
grimly and if you ask me he had
strong hands

  what you here blaisdell are
you tangled up in this one too

  the beefy patrolman said ha he
fixed a suspicious stare on blaisdell
and said he was in here when i got


argosy

here giving orders like he was running
the place

  rats said blaisdell my state-
room is down the passage i heard the
stewardess scream she told me what
she found i came to see

  metcalf hunched his chunky shoul-
ders and grinned again as he had
grinned up in the captains quarters-
a knowing grin going over to the bed
he touched the face lifted the head
slightly felt underneath the neck test-
ing the white silk handkerchief knot-
ted in the back he said and a sweet
job

  noel hoffman calm trim had gone
tc the bed he lifted one of moreles
arms an inch or so and dropped it he
grasped an ankle next and lifted it the
leg seemed to come up more loosely to
fall more loosely with a certain limp-
ness

  rigor hasnt worked down into the
lower extremities yet said hoffman
i make it three to six hours dixon
how about it

  dixon tried the leg he nodded
about that a little before the boat
docked eh id put it before day-
break

t t offman spoke to the two head-
quarters men well boys this
ones in your front yard-and ill be
darned if i know myself whether any
of it belongs to me hoffman looked
about the stateroom robbery he
said it could be that and nothing else
that is if someone had reason to be-
lieve moreles was keeping valuables in
here instead of in the ships safe who
is he anyway captain could he have
had anything in here worth stealing
captain mcrory looked baffled
angry harassed how do i know what
he had with him  the purser might be
able to tell you something i think this

fellow came aboard at la guaira
thats the port for caracas and thats
all i know

  caracas said hoffman and the
other fellow who was killed last night
came from maracaibo blaisdell how
about this dyou think the same fellow
who killed cunningham might have got
at this man 

  i dont think said blaisdell in
the captains cabin a little while ago you
assured me there wasnt a chance of
that man being aboard all the signs
indicated he had jumped overboard last
night while we were coming up the
river

   hoffmans stare was cold level for a
moment he nodded thats right
just the same-it makes one wonder
two murders-both of the victims
coming out of venezuela its an
astonishing coincidence to say the
least

  you cant hang a man on a coin-
cidence

  yeh maybe not said metcalf
but you can catch him on the coinci-
dence and hang him later the guy who
did this must still be aboard lliless
this ship was running a swimming
marathon all night last night

  captain mcrory looked startled
still aboard i forgot he exclaimed
with chagrin you gave the word to
let the passengers go ashore the gang-
ways open

  metcalf leaped for the door hey
you he blared at the broad-backed
patrolman outside are the passengers
going ashore

  sure an i thought you knew it
they was going ashore when the lady
first yelled

  stop them you lunk you oughtve
had better sense than to let em keep
going after you heard a woman
scream
santa fortuna



  we had our orders what else do
you expect

   metcalf slammed the door

   dixon had rolled the body half over
with difficulty he was untieing the
knots in the handkerchief he swore
before he was through finally he
turned untwisting the handkerchief it
was a large one-a mans

   metcalf stooped and from the scat-
tered contents of the traveling bags
picked up another large silk handker-
chief the letters am were em-
broidered in one corner he compared
them with similar letters on the hand-
kerchief he had untied and sighed
disgustedly killed him with his own
handkerchief i thought for a minute
we had something i might have known
better

   dixon stood for a moment scowling
and spoke to metcalf call headquar-
ters tell the boys to come back and
photograph and fingerprint this room
ask for a half dozen men we cant
hold these passengers all day dixon
looked at blaisdell nothing you can
tell us about this

   nothing said blaisdell he wanted
to think he wanted to question
grigsby the bandy-legged little stew-
ard who had had moreles name on his
lips when the stewardess screamed

   i guess thats all then well call
you later if theres anything

tlatsdell was not surprised to
find grigsby waiting in the state-
room behind the closed door the air
inside was blue with cigarette smoke
grigsby was pacing nervously back and
forth his face as blaisdell entered
mirrored anxiety and apprehension
hes dead said grigsby

   garroted with a silk handkerchief
what happened to the stewardess

   i give her to two of the crew an

told them to take her to the doctor
said grigsby

   blaisdell had closed the door and
lighted a cigarette what were you
going to tell me-about moreles
grigsby gulped im a fair one for
getting into trouble i wish id kept my
mouth shut sir it wasnt nothing much
it didnt have anything to do with this
lets have it anyway

   well sir its this way it was kind
of on my mind sir last night grigsby
glanced at the open port and lowered
his voice last night near eleven-
maybe it was a little before or after-i
turned into the port passage and this
south american fellow was standing
before mr cunninghams door just
standing there with a cigarette in his
mouth kind of like hed just lighted it
i didnt think nothing of it at the time
that may have been all he did stop
for said blaisdell

   grigsby nodded he seemed to snatch
at the suggestion with quick hope
thats what i think sir i do now sir
thinkin back but it did set on my mind
a little you see sir he was facing a
little toward the door-like he might
have been knocking on it

   why didnt you report it

  grigsby sighed the company
wouldnt thank me for putting suspicion
on a passenger if i talked out of turn
an was wrong id be in a fix wouldnt
i  with the company an with the
police jobs are hard to get now sir
im steady-like an dont like to be out
of work and the law fair scares me
it does ive never had nothing to do
with the law sir but it was on my
mind-and seeing as you had a little
something to do with that other matter
sir i thought id mention mr moreles
to you this morning i didnt have no
idea he was already dead whatll i do


argosy

  that said blaisdell is up to you
grigsby you dont know anything
about his death you didnt see much
last night as you say moreles merely
paused to light a cigarette

  thats right sir said grigsby
eagerly thats all i saw

  if you get into this you may be held
as the material witness you may not
even be questioned its up to you
grigsby digested that his face
cleared he looked relieved as if he had
come to a decision thank you sir
ill bear that in mind and ill be leav-
ing this ship sir i will indeed ill be
back for your bags when youre ready
to go ashore

  blaisdell had not yet packed after
grigsby had left blaisdell finished his
cigarette thoughtfully he tried to value
grigsbys information it was startling
in view of what he himself knew about
moreles but to the police it would
probably mean nothing could moreles
blaisdell wondered have killed cun-
ningham then what about obrian
the vanished coal-passer obrian had
been guilty of something he wouldnt
have been up on the boat deck ready to
fight if cornered if he hadnt he
wouldnt have vanished

  even granting that moreles had
killed cunningham-who had killed
moreles  and why  moreles had been
friendly with the simpsons-and they
were friendly with anita stoddard

  well anita stoddards traveling
companion and moreles both were dead
and it made a meaningless puzzle com-
plicated by the air of furtive knowledge
moreles had borne toward anita
stoddard

  a knock drew blaisdell to the door
a group of brisk-looking and deter-
mined young men were crowding the
passage outside

  will you make a statement for the
press mr blaisdell

  what happened on the boat deck
last night mr blaisdell 

  do you know anything about this
business down the hall

  hold it tony

 flash

blaisdell blinked as a flash bulb
went off the lens of a camera
which had appeared suddenly over a
shoulder caught his annoyed frown
the grinning photographer was benny
hyde who had been a tulane man in
blaisdells class

  loosen up tony benny said
youll have to give sooner or later
you cant dodge this story

  blaisdells smile was rueful evi-
dently not with you leading the pack
benny come in gentlemen

  blaisdell had forgotten the press he
might he thought have known this
was coming the newspaper men had
been kept off the ship until now they
were being barred from the moreles
cabin for the moment they made up
for the delay by a furious barrage of
questions and when they had gotten
all blaisdell would tell them they
bolted out to catch the next edition

  benny hyde thin and bubbling with
cheerfulness promised as he went out
ill see you at the office later tony
if you get anything save it for me
this ships turning into a charnel
house so long fella

  blaisdell finished his packing and
then there was another knock on the
door tony jerked around eased his
jumping nerves took a breath and
called out a come in that sounded
reasonably cool

  i say old man ive been looking
for you simpson was grave he
looked concerned bad business this
eh simpson pulled his briar pipe out
of his pocket and fingered it nervously
santa fortuna



his eyes gray and steady lingered on
blaisdells face for a moment and
dropped to the pipe

  something happened last night
said simpson i didnt think much of
it at the time but you seemed to know
this chap moreles-and i wonder if
itd mean anything to you

  i knew him only slightly

  yes of course and so did we-
only slightly said simpson hastily
he scraped up an acquaintance with
mrs simpson and myself for some
reason or other we still dont know
exactly why simpson looked straight-
forward enough-and yet he was wan-
dering around the point and doing a
clumsy best to create assurance blais-
dell waited simpson shook his head
frowned and went on

  for some reason or other moreles
came to our stateroom last night after
poor cunninghams body was found
he seemed to want to talk about it-
talk about cunningham and miss-
reyes

  stoddard you mean dont you
simpson stared at him er-yes of
course well-moreles ambled on and
suddenly looked at us like a sharp little
rat and asked if royal l meant
anything to us it didnt i was rather
curt with him he took the hint and
left-met you outside the door i
noticed-and the next thing we heard
was the news this morning that he had
been murdered

  royal  

  yes you seemed friendly with him
-you were one of the first at his body
this morning werent you-and i was
wondering if the number meant any-
thing to you simpsons manner was
disarmingly innocent

  he didnt mention it to me said
blaisdell

  simpson shook his head i didnt

think much of it last night-but since
hes dead ive been puzzling over his
question theres a royal street of
course in the french quarter i was
wondering if it wasnt an address there
and why he asked us if we knew any-
thing about it

  what do the detectives think
simpson shrugged i havent men-
tioned it matter of fact neither mrs
simpson nor myself want to get messed
up in the business one thing and an-
other itd mean wed have to bring
anita stoddard into it shes got
enough to shoulder as it is
thoughtful of you

  not at all not at all we like her
no end and were considering ourselves
also

  how long have you known her
simpson gave him a stare some
years he said briefly and it was plain
he didnt care to go into the matter
further he slipped the pipe back into
his pocket if you dont know any-
thing you dont he said

  just a minute blaisdell stopped
him are you going to report this
not until after we see miss stod-
dard simpson said stiffly he nodded
and walked away

  blaisdell stared at the mans straight
back queer some purpose there the
yarn didnt ring true it might be a
clumsy attempt to explain moreles
visit last night but  royal   
might be a lead to something   

chapter v

royal street

tolaisdell left the ship as soon
as possible he spoke briefly to
hoffman before going ashore and re-
ceived leave to disembark he boarded
a taxi that dropped him on royal
street-old royal street narrow


argosy

grimy shabby with generations and
centuries of living and dying under the
french the spanish and the americans

 the proud old days were gone
ghosts only were left ghosts of the
past lingering in the handwrought iron
balconies overhanging the sidewalks
the damp old houses shadowy and
crumbling the mossy courtyards back
out of sight where vivid memories of
the past hid and sulked from the noisy
clamor of the present

  blaisdell had always liked the french
quarter-and now as he paused on the
sidewalk opposite he saw with a tin-
gling rise in his pulses that there was a
 j somehow he hadnt been sure 
there would be he patted the small
automatic hed put inside his coat be-
fore coming ashore and then renewed
his inspection of number 

  it was one of the older houses two
stories high with a courtyard reached
by a carriage entrance through a
vaulted archway bisecting the front of
the house solid wooden gates on huge
iron hinges barred the carriage en-
trance and there was a house door to
the right and a door to the left the
windows were shuttered and the house
seemed deserted

  next door from a smaller narrower
house a fat woman emerged and began
sweeping the sidewalk blaisdell crossed
over and spoke to her

  who lives in that house next door

  she had more than a trace of a black
mustache on which tiny droplets of
perspiration clung and she stopped
sweeping and looked at him sus-
piciously

  whassa matter you as me she
demanded

  sorry said blaisdell im merely
curious

  thas wha one young lady as me-
an i tella her the same i don know

two-tree day someone there she
knock-she go-a in shes-a in there
now maybe you try eh

  young lady said blaisdell
quickly what did she look like

  ah-so he received a knowing
look blacka dress blacka hair an
shes-a look like an angel-so high
thanks he said

  so anita stoddard also knew about
the number blaisdell walked to the
next door beside the carriage entrance
and knocked the fat lady leaned on
her broom and watched him

  twice he had to knock-then a
youngish woman opened the door red-
headed pretty in a flamboyant way her
lips were too bold and red and an un-
conscious challenge was in her look
this certainly was not a face like an
angels

  im looking tor the young lady who
came in here a little while ago blais-
dell said

  she was chewing gum estimating
him what young lady she coun-
tered

  the one in black will you tell her
blaisdell is here

  oh youre with her

just give her my name please
instead she smiled and stepped back
come in ill tell her blaisdell en-
tered and she closed the door the shut-
tered windows cut off most of the light

    room had a damp musty smell the
odor of a place little lived in the few
pieces of furniture looked old worn

  and the red-headed girl paused and
said anyone else with you

  im alone said blaisdell

  he thought she looked relieved
well you aint now sit down here
ill go get her funny she didnt say
anything about you maybe i oughta
open the shutters ill do it when i come
back just sit there
santa portuna



  she disappeared through a door at
the back of the room behind blaisdells
chair with the closing of the door
silence fell street sounds were so
muted that blaisdell had the feeling he
was far from the outside world the
silence had a quality almost ominous
blaisdell suddenly realized the back of
his neck was tight and cold with an
unaccountable feeling of danger

he sat for a moment restlessly and
then yielded to his itching desire
to rove about he moved silently to the
door listened a moment opened it
gently beyond was a short passage
dimly lighted by a half-open door at
the other end and when he reached the
door he saw an enclosed stairway lead-
ing up and through the door before
him the mossy bricks of a patio pave-
ment and a tall graceful clump of bam-
boo at the back of the patio

  hand in his pocket blaisdell stepped
into the doorway-and stopped sud-
denly as he saw two men in the middle
of the patio coming toward him the
red-headed girl was following them
one of the men was about blaisdells
height with dark stubble on his thin
face the other had a swarthy skin
powerful shoulders long arms and car-
ried a revolver

  the mustache had been shaved blais-
dell saw as he jerked the automatic
from his pocket but the lips looked
swollen and he knew instantly this
must be obrian the man he had
battled with on the santa fortums
boat deck the man he suspected of
killing cunningham

  obrian saw him the same instant-
and fired as he saw blaisdells auto-
matic come out the crashing shot
spewed splinters against blaisdells
right cheek and eye as the bullet
smashed the door beside his head a

splinter struck his right eyeball blind-
ing him and he dodged back and
slammed the door

  the second man had also drawn a
gun blaisdell backed along the passage
dabbing at his eye and trying to see
with the other the opening of the door

  but the door did not open an auto-
mobile engine filled the patio with the
rush of its exhaust blaisdell realized
the car had been standing in the
carriage-way through the building and
now was leaving he turned and
stumbled into the front room a door
there led into the carriage-way it was
locked by that time blaisdell dis-
covered that the automobile had gone
over the sidewalk into the street

   still half blinded with tears blaisdell
ran to the front door and found it also
locked the red-headed girl had turned
a key and removed it while she stood
there and directed him to a chair

  swearing under his breath blaisdell
ran back to the patio door his eyes
were clearing the splinter had not
penetrated the eyeball and the tears had
washed it away mopping his eyes with
a handkerchief he opened the door and
stood flat against the wall for an in-
stant and then ducked out into the
patio ready to shoot

  the patio was empty the automo-
bile had been no ruse to bring him out
into the open the great wooden doors
at the other end of the carriage-way
stood open now to the sidewalk and the
street and there were black drops of oil
on the old bricks at his left where the
car had stood

  sick with apprehension blaisdell
started for the sidewalk then sud-
denly the sweetest sound he had ever
heard came out of the patio behind him

  mr blaisdell

  anita stoddard was there running
toward him from the back of the patio


argosy

lovely and stunning in the slim sheath
of a black dress and as blaisdell went
to meet her he thought the delicate
fairness of her features had all the
breathtaking contrast of a fragile
white orchid against a black velvet
background

  she was laughing-and close to tears
-as they met you-anthony blais-
dell  how can you be here how could
you be here in time

  they got away blaisdell said
how many were there

  three-two men and a girl
theyre all gone then if id known
one of them was obrian id not have
been such a stupid idiot as to let it
happen blaisdell groaned what
brought you here 

  vera simpson told me this man
moreles-

  simpson told me blaisdell broke

in

  i had to see what he meant

  you should have told me and let me
come

  she said i could not wait as soon
as i could get away from the police i
went to see mr haughton and then be-
cause he was so busy for a little i came
here and the girl answered the door
and i said that mr moreles had sent
me and she was astonished and asked
me to come in and when i was in-
suddenly there was this man obrian
in the room-and they asked me ques-
tions and finally took me to an old
empty room at the back there and
locked me in there were no windows
i do not know what they were going to
do next

  wrhat did they ask you 

  what happened on the ship later
last night she said

  obrian didnt know

  no he seemed to know nothing
after his fight with you

  then he swam ashore said blais-
dell the fellow must be like an otter
in the water what else

  he wanted to know why i was in
new orleans-and what i would do if
i went back to venezuela and i told
him that when i went back i would
keep the rancho del sol-and he
sneered at me and said i was too sure
then this is all about your estate
she shrugged so it seems

  did he say what moreles had to do
with it

  so queer she said wrinkling her
forehead he did not seem to know
about this man moreles he asked me
questions-he seemed startled that
moreles would know this house num-
ber he did not see how it was possible
he seemed to think i was not telling
the truth-and i think they wanted to
leave quickly because they did not know
the answer to moreles they sent the
girl to watch the front door to see if
anyone was coming

  perhaps said blaisdell grimly
moreles didnt know

  but vera simpson told me-
who are the simpsons how long
have you known them 

  why-why vera is an old friend
i have known her several years her
husband is a chemist they travel much
i met them by chance in maracaibo this
time they were going to curacao also
and then on to new orleans it was so
nice having vera on the same boat
what were they doing in mara-
caibo

  it was some business vera said
something about oil why do you ask
these questions still wide-eyed she
protested impulsively you cant think
vera and her husband  

  i dont know-i dont know what
to think blaisdell confessed with a
scowl the simpsons were talking
santa fortuna



with moreles last night-and this

morning my steward told me he sur-
prised moreles outside cunninghams
door last night standing there pretend-
ing to light a cigarette-and this morn-
ing the simpsons have a cock-and-bull
story for both of us about a remark
moreles dropped to them last night a
story which draws us both here to a
trap-and yet by the evidence of
obrian himself he doesnt seem to
know moreles whats the answer
its the simpsons isnt it they-not
moreles- got us here where obrian
is waiting

  no-no not vera we will find
this man moreles and see what he has
to say

  hes dead blaisdell told her
moreles was murdered this morning
some time before daybreak garroted in
his own stateroom

  she was stunned sick horrified and
bewildered

  why should he have been mur-
dered  she cried

  quicn sabef said blaisdell

  this is so terrible what is happen-
ing what can we do she cried in
distress

  we can get a police alarm out about
obrian said blaisdell did you find
any trace of him at headquarters or
get a good look at the car they had
here or notice the license number
no at headquarters i looked at so
many pictures i was dizzy and none of
thdm i could recognize and i think the
automobile was a dark color-perhaps
black that is all i saw when they took
me through the patio must we tell the
police they are gone we cannot catch
them i do not want to be in the news-
papers any more or explain to the
police any more today i must go into
the country this evening i asked mr
haughton if you could come to desiree

plantation while i was there and he
said you were to come

  what is desiree plantation blais-
dell asked

  it is mine i must go there quickly
can we not forget-this for a little
while anyway  the simpsons are com-
ing to desiree also

  she was anxious pleading coaxing
-but it was the matter of the simp-
sons that decided him to go to the
police now about this latest episode
would make confusion delay publicity
-and probably accomplish little but if
there was another meeting with the
simpsons ahead something might be
accomplished

  stand here blaisdell said scream
if you see anything to alarm you
obediently she stood there while gun
in hand he looked hastily around the
place many doors were locked every-
thing he was able to see bore out the
fat womans statement that this old
house had not been lived in except for
sketchy use the last day or so

  blaisdell came back to anita stod-
dard and said its taking a long
chance-a foolish chance of trouble
with the police-and perhaps more
trouble ahead for you but if we can
get out of this neighborhood without
having to explain well forget it for a
little

  she smiled then-and it was like the
clouds parting and the warm tingling
sunshine descending blaisdell thought
and if he was a bit giddy with such
thoughts he was aware of it and didnt
care

chapter vi

said the spider to the fly

rjlhey walked out between the great
open doors into the sunlight wash-
ing shabby royal street the fat worn-


argosy

an was gone and no one paid any
attention to them blaisdell closed the
doors they left the old musty house
brooding there and walked a block be-
fore blaisdell hailed a passing taxicab

  canal and carondelet he said for
want of anything better because that
was the nearest the delta corporations
offices and when the cab moved on
with them he asked now what about
desiree plantation

  it was a property of my fathers i
must go there quickly please now will
you drop me at my hotel i will send
directions to your hotel about desiree
why not let me drive you there in
my car

  but an automobile is coming for me
and you will not be ready so soon mr
haughton assured me of that

  blaisdell grinned ruefully and told
the driver to go to the leeland hotel

by the way whos going to take you
to the plantation  and how far is it 
seventy miles she said jack
carnochan is coming the carnochans
live on the place they were relatives

i	have never seen them i radioed them

i	was coming and i telephoned them
from mr haughtons office

  the taxi pulled to the curb in front
of the leeland blaisdell watched her
quick light steps go up to the entrance
and then he hurried to the fifth floor
suite of offices which the delta corpo-
ration occupied just off canal street

  sam haughton was waiting for him
the old mans roar of welcome echoed
down the hall as blaisdell walked into
haughtons inner office

  ive been wondering when youd
get here police swarming all over the
place asking questions about you the
newspapers yammering at the door for
your life history and miss stoddard
telling me what a comfort you are and
pleading for your further services sit

  down do some fast talking theres
a lot of ground to cover in a hurry
ive got to catch the plane to new york
today

  the old mans hair was white up-
standing in a belligerent shock and his
eyebrows were bushy and challenging
sixty perhaps he looked under fifty
and he was tall spare powerful age
had not changed the spirit which had
run a small grubstake into a tiny gold
mine in the idaho rockies and levered
that mine into a chilian copper conces-
sion and then into more concessions
and finally into the delta corporation
which at one time or another in the past
thirty years had possessed interests in
every republic from the rio grande to
the strait of magellan and his voice
was quiet now when blaisdell paused
who is armando moreles

  he was in caracas i had to deal
with him on that la paz matter last
year he was coming north for his
political health i thought

  its a regrettable mess sam
haughton grunted and i dont know
whether or not you did right in not
calling the police at once about this
royal street matter its done now
however the inter-office telephone
buzzed the old man switched it on and
said yes

  miss luchs voice from the reception
room said mr shannon and mr
darnford are here

  two minutes said the old man
and cut the connection and spoke re-
gretfully to blaisdell ill have to see
them get your reports in shape look at
your mail and well have a conference
on your trip as soon as possible
blaisdell found his desk stacked with
mail before ringing for a secretary he
glanced in the telephone book called a
number a womans voice said the
rapp agency

               	a-
santa fortuna



  mr rapp please

  and in a moment a cautious voice
said mr rapp speaking

  this is blaisdell rapp the delta
corporation

  mr rapp lost his caution delighted
-a pleasure how are you mr blais-
dell

  ive a job for you rapp i want the
same service you always give us a
couple named simpson are landing
from the santa fortuna this morning
they intended to register at the lee-
land put a man on them-two men-
as many as you need i want to know
anything you can find out about them
and everything they do keep me per-
sonally posted and theres an empty
house at  royal i want investi-
gated i want to know who owns it
who has been there in the last few days
and who comes there if anyone in the
next few days and what they do if
anyone but the police come dont lose
sight of them im going out of town

i	believe ill call you later and tell you
where ill be

  it will help to know what my men
are looking for mr blaisdell

  i dont know myself spend all the
money you need to

  that cried mr rapp with quick
enthusiasm is the way a client should
talk ill have men on all this at once

nphere were stacks of mail blais-
- dell was throwing machine-gun
dictation in alternate bursts to two
secretaries when he had to tear himself
away and spend an hour and a half with
the old man and three of the delta
officials covering the results of his trip

  by that time he had been subpoenaed
to the inquest of cunninghams death
at one-thirty pm there was barely
time for a quick lunch-and then he
found himself once more aboard the

 	a-

santa fortuna where a double inquest
was being held in the empty cavern of
the lounge

  sam haughton was there with anita
stoddard hoffman hetcalf and dixon
were there the simpsons were not
and as he sat down beside anita stod-
dard blaisdell looked over and met
hoffmans cool stare he realized sud-
denly that hoffman must have thought
he was lying when in the captains
cabin he had denied any knowledge of
anita stoddards affairs hoffman may
have known then that she was going to
the delta offices

  the coroner rapped for order and
opened the inquest he was a dry quiet
little man who droned perfunctory
questions quickly it became apparent
to blaisdell that little more than a basis
of homicide was being established he
suspected that no evidence was being
presented which was not already public
property

  hoffman came over and spoke to
him

  i see the department of justice
man commented dryly you were well
acquainted with miss stoddard after
all she has business with your com-
pany i gather

  she is a friend of mr haughtons
blaisdell said noncommitally

  hoffmans reply and smile told him
little nice she has friends hes al-
ready gone to bat for her i hear to
save her all possible annoyance

  no-you couldnt tell what hoffman
was thinking-but blaisdell decided as
he hurried back to the office that hoff-
man was not passing an idle day the
simpsons it was noticeable were en-
tirely easy about concealing the royal
street episode

  late in the afternoon rapp called
the simpsons registered at the lee-
land all right he declared im send-
argosy



ing over a detailed coverage none of
it looks important they shopped with
a miss stoddard for whom they had
engaged a room-the miss stoddard
by the way whos splashed all over the
newspapers this afternoon rapps
voice grew reproachful why didnt
you tell us what the hook-up was
because it was none of your busi-
ness blaisdell told him curtly what
about the royal street house

  funny there rapp said no-
bodys around the woman next door
described two people that sound like
you and this miss stoddard whom she
said went in there this morning several
people have been in there for a day or
so    shes not sure when they came
she thought theyd rented the place but
the place aint for rent it belongs to
some people named carnochan-

  whatr blaisdell cried carno-
chan are you certain of that

  you bet rapp declared positively
theyve owned it from away back
they dont live in town it seems we
havent located em yet all the old
timers are out of that neighborhood
lot of italians have moved in but its
still known as the old carnochan
house rapp paused does that mean
anything to you mr blaisdell 

  ive heard the name said blaisdell
never mind trying to locate them
watch the house see if you can find
out who was there

  sure-sure if you cant see your
wray clear to telling us any more rapp
said reproachfully oh yes another
thing-the cops were around there
about noon just poking around almost
caught one of our men in there hed
found the front gate unlocked an
walked in

  what did the police do

  looked around a fingerprint man
went in they chased our man away
when he stalled around and tried to see
what was going on and theyve got a
coupla men planted inside now our
man counted those who went in an
came out

  keep on watching the place blais-
dell directed

  he hung up with acute misgivings
what was coming now what had
brought the police there at noon  hoff-
man must have known about the royal
street house at the inquest yet he had
given no sign of it

  blaisdell reached for the telephone
and called the leeland miss stod-
dard

  miss stoddard has checked out
scowling blaisdell lighted a ciga-
rette and thought hard the carno-
chans  the people on desiree planta-
tion it was too late to stop her to
warn her but abruptly blaisdell de-
cided to follow to the plantation as
quickly as possible his alarm was
mounting   

to be concluded next week

bill hudson wasnt really a

ner was killed he didnt take a
dozen drinks a month which is remark-
ably few for a man stuck away in the
deep interior of china where alcohol
is a recognized specific for loneliness
not that hudson had any scruples
against tippling it was just that he
didnt like the taste of the stuff when
he did take a snort he gulped it and
made a face thats why i always said
it wasnt bill hudsons fault that he
started hitting the bottle

  of course the reverend david
prentiss would say it was bill hud-
sons fault that it was the direct result
of weakness of character and lack of
moral stamina maybe but to my way
of thinking if anybody was to blame
it was the number one taipan in the
shanghai office of the greater cathay
petroleum co ltd after tanners
ghastly end he should have sent hud-
son home on leave or at least pulled
him in to shanghai for a few months-
or to hongkong or tientsin where he
could see white faces and hear music
and laugh a little with girls of his own
race anywhere would have been all
right just so bill didnt have to live
with the nightmare of tanner being
cut to pieces

  but no to the shanghai office bill
hudson was just a pin stuck in the
sales map of china instead of a tall

slender sandy-haired young man with
serious blue eyes and a shy boyish
smile to the shanghai office it would
be wasteful and inefficient to transfer
a man who had learned enough of the
local dialect to keep his comprador
from squeezing the outlying agents too
hard moreover the taipan considered
he was rewarding hudson with a pro-
motion that meant six hundred a year
so hudson was boosted into tanners
place as manager of the district and i
was sent up to chiang-shan as his as-
sistant




argosy

  id been in chiang-shan for about
six weeks without either of us men-
tioning tanners name i knew the bare
outline of the story and i thought i
understood how hudson felt about it
so i didnt want to be the one to bring
up the subject then one night-we
were both a little tight-hudson broke
out with all the gory details

rphe prime cause of the whole busi-
ness was a little chinese general
named ko-tsao hudson who knew
something about brush writing said
that his name was really ko-tsao and
meant morning without dew but
that if you wrote it with another set of
characters and changed the pronuncia-
tion by just one apostrophe it meant
the flea this is how the people in
chiang-shan pronounced the name be-
cause ko-tsao had been hopping all
over central china for years living off
the blood and substance of the people
he was smart and had studied in
america as a boxer indemnity scholar
he had no ambitions to be a political
tuchun but maintained his private
army merely to accumulate sufficient
personal fortune to allow him to retire
to a life of leisure and collecting
twelfth century paintings on silk

  well ko-tsao had descended on the
old walled town of chiang-shan and
settled there long enough to gobble up
the revenues of the salt gabele appro-
priate the li-kin duties impose a few
extra taxes of his own and dig up
thousands of acres of ginger fields in
order to plant poppies for his own
private opium monopoly then nation-
alist troops from nanking arrived to
drive him out

  as bad luck would have it the
nationalists arrived during the chinese
new year celebration new year being
a sort of settling day for chinese busi-

ness men all the agents of greater
cathay petroleum had been bringing in
their outstanding accounts and there
were a good many thousand dollars in
cash in the oil company compound
when the battle started

  it wasnt much of a battle really
ko-tsao had got about all he wanted
out of the city anyhow and he wasnt
going to risk having his army wiped
out by the nationalists he put up just
enough of a rear-guard action to give
his men a chance to do a little last-min-
ute looting and about a hundred
picked looters made for the oil com-
pany compound which was on a hill
a few hundred yards outside the walls
of the town

  tanner and hudson didnt have
much warning theyd noticed smoke
drifting over the gray-tiled rooftops
of the walled city but that was natural
for new year because everybody was
burning strings of imitation shoe-
money made out of silver paper and
it was another hour before they finally
made out the popping of rifles above
the crepitation of new year fire-
crackers

  there were six armed gurkha
guards at the compound but tanner
knew thev couldnt hold out long

o

against an army of looters who had
smelled cash the only chance of sav-
ing the money would be for one of the
two europeans to make a break for the
company launch moored in a creek a
mile away and then try to sneak
through to the nearest consulate which
was a fifty-mile sneak tanner tossed
a yuan dollar to see which one of the
two would take the chance bill hud-
son lost

  hudson got to the foot of the hill
before he saw the first stragglers of
ko-tsaos army for nearly half an
hour he ducked in and out of a grove of
pot - valiant



  lichi trees between him and the creek
was a paddy field pimpled with grave
mounds and strewn with matting-cov-
ered coffins waiting for some geoman-
cer to announce a lucky day for burial
when he thought the coast was clear
hudson started across the field he
was half way across when another
bunch of soldiers began shooting at
him

  he dropped to cover behind a tem-
porary tomb of whitened brick and
thanked his lucky stars-at least he
thought then they were lucky-for the
burial customs of the chinese the
tomb afforded ample protection because
it was as long as a man and a roof of
gray tiles added to its height further-
more there was a rectangular aperture
at one end to allow the spirit of the de-
parted to come and go at will until final
interment hudson opened the satchel
he was carrying and began feverishly
stuffing the money it contained through
the opening into the tomb he got rid
of the last handful thirty seconds be-
fore the soldiers in gray padded uni-
forms closed in on him

hudson put up no resistance in
the first place a fight was futile
because there were more armed men
surrounding him than there were cart-
ridges in the magazine of his automatic
and in the second place he was anxious
to lead the soldiers away from his im-
promptu cache so he allowed himself
to be disarmed

  shum-mah asked hudson

  the fat moon-faced soldier who had
taken his automatic grinned at first
hudson thought he was grinning at his
accent which was closer to mandarin
than to the local dialect then he real-
ized that the chinese had recognized
him and was grinning with satisfaction
at his own inspiration

  you are number two foreign-devil
from the hill of oil said the soldier
you will go with us to the hong

  whereupon hudson was marched
back -up the hill with twenty rifles
aimed at his immediate rear he was
the human shield for the raiders but
he didnt mind because he had saved
the companys bankroll when he
reached the compound he saw that his
captors had no need of a human shield
because another and larger band of
enterprising looters had swarmed up
the hill from the other side and had the
situation well in hand

  the first thing he saw was a gurkha
guard-dead then he saw the rest of
the gurkhas herded into a corner but
before he saw anything at all he
heard- but ill let hudson tell it

  half way up the hill i could hear
tanner screaming he said but i
didnt know what it was it didnt sound
like a man it was more like a dog
howling the howling got fainter as i
got closer and just as i came into the
compound it stopped with a kind of a
whimper

  then i saw tanner and the sight
turned me inside out they had strung
him up by his thumbs from the under
side of the big moon gate his feet
were tied together and hanging six
inches off the sticky red flagstones
they hadnt believed him when he told
them there was no money in the place
and they were torturing him to make
him tell where the cash was hidden
they were working on him with long
knives hacking off small pieces of
flesh between questions taking care not
to cut too deep not to kill him too
soon

  i yelled at them to stop that id
take them to where the bankroll was

i even told them exactly where id hid-
den it but they wouldnt believe fhe


argosy

they thought i was trying to trick
them into leaving the compound

  tanner was too far gone to speak
at least he didnt say anything with his
lips but his eyes     mitch i can
still see the helpless hopeless agony of
his eyes pleading with me to do some-
thing anything to put him out of his
misery

  then a nationalist plane came
swooping over the hill and sprayed
machine-gun bullets into the compound
that settled it ko-tsaos men saw they
were about to be hemmed in and they
ran

  i cut tanner down wondering if
id have the guts to do what he wanted
me to but while i was carrying him
into the house i discovered i wouldnt
have to a machine-gun bullet had
ricocheted off the flag-stones and done
a merciful job

  bill hudson paused poured himself
half a tumblerful of straight scotch
downed it at one gulp without tasting
it he made an awful face as he caught
his breath he asked now do you
know why im always a little plastered
mitch

  i never blamed you i told him

  he looked at me for a minute then
shook his head he laughed-the kind
of a laugh that always gave me the
creeps because it wasnt funny

  you dont know a thing about it
he said its not tanner im trying to
get away from its me im afraid
mitch im afraid of being afraid if i
didnt keep tanked up with dutch cour-
age id run away skip the country
and i cant do that mitch i dont
want to be a coward at least i dont
want to act like one-when ko-tsao
comes back

  forget it i told him youre not
a coward and anyhow ko-tsao wont
be back i reached for the bottle too

  hell come back said hudson

  and ko-tsao did

 a disagreeable summer was
crawling into its nastiest months
the lichi nuts had ripened to bright red
clusters glistening like drops of fresh
blood when the hot sticky rains beat
down on the grove at the foot of the
oil companys hill the twisting cobbled
streets of intramural chiang-shan
converted into gloomy corridors by the
matting sun-strips that joined the shop
fronts stank of fish and sweat and or-
dure the annual outbreak of cholera
had begun coffin-makers shops were
piled deep with fresh wood shavings
and geomancers were swamped with
requests for lucky burial days mis-
sionaries whose home boards con-
cern for pagan souls was matched by
their generosity left for the summer
colony at kuling bill hudson and i
were afire with prickly heat and irrasci-
ble from muggy sleepless nights so we
snarled at each other over warm sick-
ening drinks at least whiskey-tajwaw
was sickening to me without ice it
didnt matter to hudson because he was
still tossing it off neat without tansan
he was tossing it off at such a rate
too that we were down to our last two
quarts which had to last us until our
next batch of supplies came up from
the companys regular monthly ship-
ment and the shipment was late

  it was a rather complicated business
getting supplies to chiang-shan they
came up seven hundred miles from
shanghai by river steamer then they
finally reached us overland by coolie
back wheelbarrow-and by coolie-
drawn barges when there was enough
water in the creek they all had to be
handled and rehandled like that thou-
sands of gallons of kerosene and gaso-
line paraffine candles lamps by the
pot - valiant



gross    and our own quota of ciga-
rettes and tinned food and several cases
of whiskey and maybe one of gin so
a few days delay was not unusual
when the delay lengthened to a week
however both of us knew something
was wrong both of us had a pretty
good idea what was wrong too but
neither of us said anything then one
day at tiffin the comprador came in
with the news he had picked up in the
reeking streets of chiang-shan ko-
tsao was moving up from the river
valley

  general ko-tsao it seemed was now
calling himself marshal ko-tsao he
had spent a profitable spring and sum-
mer foraging through szechuan prov-
ince and had taxed and looted his
treasury into an enviable state of pleni-
tude he could afford to buy himself a
squadron of american fighting planes
a fleet of small boats to consolidate his
li-kin ports on the great river and two
divisions-complete with generals and
artillery-of ex-nationalist troops the
last purchase universally considered
legitimate and wise tactics in chinese
warfare was perhaps his most valu-
able acquisition for not only did it aug-
ment his army with well-trained officers
and well-equipped troops but it simul-
taneously removed the most important
obstacle to his reconquest of chiang-
shan and chiang-shan the compra-
dor assured me would fall within
forty-eight hours

  the marshal has requisitioned the
greater cathay supply train said the
comprador but he didnt have to tell
us because wed both guessed it al-
ready

that afternoon we saw the first
signs of ko-tsaos advance a big
tri-motored biplane wheeled ominously
over chiang-shan dropping leaflets in-

side of bombs and thereby indicating
that ko-tsao was planning to buy over
a few more regiments of the citys de-
fenders before making his triumphal
entry

  toward sundown the terrified peas-
ants started streaming into the city
the narrow flagged trails were clogged
with whole families and their house-
hold possessions men women and chil-
dren pushed and shuffled along with
their crescent-horned water-buffalos
and their herds of pigs whose grunting
mingled with the shrill complaint of
ungreased wheel-barrows and the fal-
setto chant of coolies maneuvering
heavy loads on their shoulder-poles the
confusion was the greatest where the
central gate pierced the city wall here
the crowd poured through the gloomy
tunnel under the bright-pink drum
tower with its multiple tiers of sweep-
ing curled-up roofs of green tile
watching them through a pair of
binoculars i wondered at the peculiar
trust of the chinese in their thousand-
year-old walls despite the eloquent
drone of the modern bombing plane
which proclaimed the uselessness of
such ancient fortifications i decided
that in another thousand years the
chinese would still have their strange
instinct for shutting themselves up be-
hind walls for huddling together like
sheep when danger threatened

  then the reverend david prentiss
arrived at  the greater cathay com-
pound and i realized that the instinct
was not peculiar to the chinese

  the reverend prentiss was a well-
fed rosy-cheeked individual whose
white hair and gold-rimmed spectacles
gave him a sanctimonious almost
austere air despite his rotund contours
he was the dean of the missionary
colony at chiang-shan which kept
very much to itself on the far side of


argosy

the city as in all chinese cities there
was no love lost between the mission-
aries and the representatives of west-
ern commerce because the men of
commerce usually comported them-
selves in direct contradiction to the
ideas which the men of god were try-
ing to instill into their chinese pros-
elytes but today-

  i have come to ask you to give shel-
ter to our mission families during the
period of the impending crisis said
the reverend prentiss i believe you
will agree with me that at a time like
this it is only fitting that all of us
foreigners should band together for
mutual protection

  of course i said the of course
meant that i knew verv well that the

                                           j

mutual protection would consist of
the advantageous defensive position of
our hill-top compound together with
the fact that since tanners murder
our shanghai office had sent us two
machine-guns and doubled the number
of our gurkha guard i didnt men-
tion this to the reverend prentiss
however i just said im sure mr
hudson will give his permission

  the missionarys mouth shirred up
as though hed just bitten into a green
persimmon he asked is mr hudson
   er    sober enough to make a rea-
sonable decision 

  hes the boss around here i said
i went off to find bill hudson he
wasnt sober by a long shot but he was
sympathetic enough tell them well
take care of em he said if they
bring their own food-in case of a long
siege

so by dinner time the missionaries
had moved in on us there were
five families of them and a few unat-
tached serious-faced pimply young
men they moved in with their dowdy

bespectacled wives their shrill-voiced
children two new-born babes their
amahs and household servants their
cooking utensils and their emergency
rations they also brought their bibles
their hymn books and a portable har-
monium after dinner they set up the
harmonium on the flags of the court-
yard and went right to work under the
heat-blurred stars praying for our
mutual safety

  they sang their heads off those mis-
sionaries half of them were singing
off key and the rest sang more like
crows than canaries still i couldnt
laugh at them there was a touching
fervor in that discordant chorus a
simple gusto that did something to me
as i sat inside with bill hudson work-
ing on our last bottle of scotch then
one of our outlying agents came in
panting and the whole performance
suddenly seemed silly and childish

  the goggle-eyed agent said that ko-
tsaos army had camped for the night
at li-tzu which was just five miles
from the city and that the nationalist
garrison at chiang-shan was preparing
for a hasty strategic retreat

  when he left we did a lot of damage
to that last bottle most of it being done
by hudson there were just about
three drinks left when we went to bed

  the next day was a scorcher by
breakfast time the sun was already so
hot that it made the hair curl on my
arms i could almost see the smells
drifting up out of the streets of
chaing-shan in waves and i could
see the waves of gray uniforms come
snaking through the haze that covered
the fields there were thousands of
them-how many i couldnt estimate
because they were raising their own
dust clouds that hung low with the
morning mist and the ranks dis-
appeared long before i saw the end
pot - valiant



  when hudson saw the sun glinting
on the bayonets of the advancing tide
he skipped breakfast and finished up
what was left in the bottle then he
called out the gurkhas and posted
them like a real strategist he planted
the two machine-guns at the ends of
the compound where they could each
command two slopes in case of a flank-
ing movement put his rifles in all the
front windows to meet a direct attack
and then he and i climbed to the roof
of the go-down where our reserve stock
was stored with binoculars and our own
rifles then we lav down to wait and
roast on the corrugated iron roof
while the harmonium in the courtyard
got into action again

  and we didnt have long to wait be-
fore we saw a platoon coming up the
hill in what looked to be a column of
files hudson yelled an order to the
captain of the gurkhas while i watched
the platoon through the binoculars
after a minute i said

  whoa bill tell em to hold every-
thing the attacking party packs a
white flag

  maybe its a trick said hudson
but it wasnt a trick it was marshall
ko-tsao himself paying us a visit
pretty soon we could see the red and
gold of his sedan chair coming up the
hill on the shoulders of four men we
could see the out-runners coming on
ahead waving automatics the flag of
truce fluttering above a thicket of bay-
onets and a lot of gold-braided staff
officers bringing up in the rear when
we could hear the ho hey ho hey of
the chair carriers we got down oft the
burning roof

a few minutes later we were sit-
ting around the dining room table
with ko-tsao and his staff the rev-
erend prentiss insisted on sitting in as

representative of the mission com-
munity we let him sit as long as he
understood that bill hudson was boss
and had full say bill hudson was boss
too he had enough liquor in him to
make his lower jaw stick out half an
inch and when he talked to ko-tsao he
sounded plenty tough

  well what do you want he de-
manded as soon as ko-tsao sat down

   the marshal leaned back in his chair
and lit a cigar six inches long he was
a jaunty little man with the gold-
braided visor of his kepi pulled down
over one eye at a rakish angle if it
hadnt been for his narrow almost-lid-
less eyes he could have passed for an
occidental-particularly when he be-
gan to talk hed picked up a strong
american accent and some choice
american slang during his boxer
scholarship in the states he winked
at us through the cigar smoke

  i want the works he said and
quick

  meaning what hudson asked

  gasoline said ko-tsao petrol

  you hijacked our supply train a
couple of days ago hudson came back
at him isnt that enough for you

   its n g said the marshal low-
grade distillate and kerosene ive got
an air force now and those big crates
sure eat up the gas i need high-octane
stuff that i can feed the planes and
youve got a couple of thousand drums
of it in your go-down i want it

   its going to be hard to steal said
hudson

  ko-tsao laughed and slapped the
table with the flat of his pudgy hand
but i pay cash he said im even
going to lay it on the line for that punk
distillate

  he turned and uttered a few mono-
syllables to one of his staff the officer
undid a cloth-tied squarish package


argosy

a dozen fat bundles of crisp new bank-
notes fell out on the table they were so
new that i could smell the fresh
printers-ink

  hudson glanced at them and said
we do business on a strict silver basis
youll have to pay in hai-kwan taels
or shanghai or hankow currency-not
with cigar coupons

  ko-tsao scowled he said my cur-
rency is legal tender in all territory my
troops occupy anybody who wont ac-
cept it gets shot

  i wont accept it said hudson
his jaw stuck out another quarter-inch
he stared at the marshal and the mar-
shal stared back there was a long
silence until hudson figured hed
stared the marshal down then he
went on furthermore theres some
stuff in that supply train you hijacked
thats not for sale theres half a dozen
cases of scotch-

  sure i know said ko-tsao i
wanted to compliment you on your
taste in whisky its swell stuff

   ill need it today said hudson
sorry said ko-tsao but its hard
to get decent stuff around this neck of
the woods im keeping it now about
that gasoline-

   its no deal said hudson i dont
like your credit rating

  youd better sell it to me said
ko-tsao if you dont sell ill take it
anyhow

  try said hudson

  marshal ko-tsao stood up ill give
you time to think it over he said ill
give you until sundown if i dont hear
from you by sundown youll hear from
and plenty

ill be waiting with all the snappy
answers said hudson and now
youd better clear out of here before
i forget to honor that flag of truce
and do the people of china a great big

me-

it t

favor if all the vermin like you were
exterminated this country-

  please please mr hudson the
reverend prentiss broke in cant
you gentlemen come to some agree-
ment cant-

   dont start an argument prentiss
hudson cut him off the tuchun is in
an awful hurry goodbye general
flea

   ko-tsao gave another order and his
staff backed toward the door hands on
their side arms for a minute i thought
hudsons dutch courage had gone a
little too far that we were in for it
i grabbed by own automatic under the
table but nothing happened except
ko-tsaos farewell speech in the door-
way

   so long gents said the marshal
ill be seeing you-at sundown if not
before

   then he left

 s soon as hed gone i grabbed
hudsons hand and pumped it
thats standing up to em bill i
said

  the reverend david prentiss came
over and stood in front of hudson
the corners of his mouth curved down
partly in distaste for the flavor of hud-
sons whisky breath partly in pity and
contempt

   pot-valiant said the missionary
drunken bravado why didnt you let
him have his gasoline then he
wouldnt have molested us   
wouldnt he though snapped
hudson i thought you knew the
oriental mind better than that pren-
tiss i thought you understood face
pidgin if id have backed down to
ko-tsao id have lost face to lose
face is a sign of weakness weakness
is a signal for everybody to jump on
the man whos down the only way to
pot - valiant



keep ko-tsao out of this compound is
to speak to him in his own language

  but what can you hope to do  pro-
tested the reverend prentiss what
can you do against a whole army

  i can call their bluff hudson re-
plied they still think im bluffing
when they find out i mean business
theyll go away and let us alone and
by the way prentiss suppose you let
me take care of the practical details of
this and ill let you take care of all the
praying

  the reverend prentiss bowed his
head thank you he murmured
for reminding me of my vow of hu-
mility for a moment i was almost
bold enough to oppose the will of god
you are right our only salvation lies
in prayer he went out

  as soon as he left the room bill
hudson began to tremble he sat
down as though his knees wouldnt
hold him any longer he ran his shak-
ing hand across his pale perspiring
forehead

  its wearing off mitch he said
i need a drink i need lots of drinks
-enough to get me through the day
and probably the nighf can you get it
for me mitch

  i can try i told him

  get anything he said even that
chinese rot-gut that smells like mouldy
straw i wont taste it anyhow ive got
to face this mitch-and i cant unless
you get me enough bottled courage to
pull me through

  ill get it i said i dug up the
number one houseboy who was as re-
sourceful as all number one boys in
china are supposed to be i gave him
some money and told him to try to find
some sam-shm shop that was still out-
side of ko-tsaos lines

bring back three bottles of ng-ka-
pay i told him six bottles if you

can get them and can carry them
can do was his reply it always
was

t went inside to the office and tried
to work i went over a stack of ac-
counts but they didnt seem to make
much sense i found myself watching
the flies swarming in the glare of the
court yard listening to that strange
muted sound of an army moving the
collective tread of ten thousand feet
the vague inexorable rumble like the
distant sound of the sea after a while
i quit pretending to work and went to
one of the front windows where i
could watch the troop concentration
too fast i thought for their own
good a squadron of nationalist
bombers could do terrific damage but
there was no sign of nationalist op-
postion of any kind-only ko-tsaos
gray-uniformed hordes coming on
and on they hadnt made any at-
tempt on our hill-top as yet but they
were moving up between me and the
city walls so that we were completely
cut off i wondered if the number one
boy had been able to get through be-
fore the encircling movement was com-
plete i was still wondering when the
reverend david prentiss came in

  i must ask you said the mis-
sionary to maintain better discipline
among your servants

meaning what i wanted to know
i just caught your number one boy
attempting to smuggle liquor into the
compound said the reverend pren-
tiss

  you did-what

  i destroyed it of course said the
reverend prentiss six bottles of
some vile chinese intoxicant i smash-
ed them all

  i didnt say anything i couldnt i
was stunned by the realization of what


argosy

the reverend prentiss had done with-
out knowing it to bill hudson-and
to himself

  i hope you understand mr mit-
chell the reverend prentiss went on
that this is no time for drink-fuddled
minds and shaky nerves we must
meet this situation with clear sane
eyes mr mitchell we cannot trust
our lives to drunkards

  sure i said of course

  i went off to find hudson who had
shut himself up in his room he
greeted me eagerly with did you
bring it

  i shook my head the boy couldnt
get through i lied were complete-
ly cut off

  hudson groaned he flopped on his
bed lay looking up at the ceiling for a
long time at last he said why am
i such a coward mitch his voice
was like a little boys

  youre no more coward than i
am  told him not as much i
wouldnt have had the guts to go
through the tanner business without
going crazy

  i cant go through it again he
said

  youll be all right when you get a
little sleep i told him you catch a
few winks of tang-hsia ill wake you
up if anything pops

   i cant sleep mitch he said hope-
lessly i couldnt sleep last night even
with all that booze i killed im fin-
ished

  maybe you better go down and
give the gurkhas their orders then
i said

  you go mitch

  they wont listen to me you know
the gurkhas theyll take orders from
the number one boss

  tell em im sick said hudson
listlessly

well i never went through
such a long afternoon it got
hotter and hotter as the sun went low-
er i suppose it was because the flag-
stones and the masonry walls of the
compound heated up aal turned the
courtyards into fireless cookers the
corrugated-iron roof of the go-dozvn
shimmered and danced in its own heat
waves and i-well i stewed in my
own juice

  the gurkhas were squatting in the
shade in front of their own quarters
smoking and gambling for coppers
when i told the captain he had better
take his post he merely looked at me

  where is the master he asked

  i told him that hudson was ill a
touch of the sun he gave me a funny
grin then lit a cigarette

  we will wait he said until the
master is well enough to give the or-
ders

  that was the answer i expected
theyre spunky soldiers these gurk-
has and great fighters but they were
after all only mercenaries they didnt
mind the risk of getting their vitals
riddled with lead if the white man who
paid them took the same chance but
if there was any shirking going on
the gurkhas would just as soon smoke
and gamble for coppers there was
only one thing left for me to do

  the sun sank into a dirty smother
of haze along the western hills the
refraction effect through the murk
made it seem to flatten and twist itself
into a grotesque elongated shape like
a great oriental eye-a red glaring
eye  in one of the courtyards the
missionaries were gathered about the
harmonium swelling their rapturous
voices in a heart-felt if not quite mu-
sical chorus   

  when i went into bill hudsons
room he jumped off the bed as though
pot-valiant



he were going to pounce on me cant
you stop that caterwauling he yelled
those psalm-singers are driving me
mad

  be yourself bill i told him we
all need something to put heart into us
and stiffen our spines theyve got
their hymns youve got your fire-
water

  i havent got it though

  i have i said taking a bottle
from my hip-pocket heres a quart
ive had stuck away for emergencies
i didnt bring it out before because i
was saving it for when you needed
it most i guess this is the time
hudson came over with slow sus-
picious steps stared through the thick
dusk at the bottle then he grabbed it
poured out half a tumblerful of dark
amber fluid downed it in two breath-
less gulps even in the gloom i could
see the face he made as he gasped i
tried to take back the bottle

  one more mitch he pleaded
go easy i said its all there is
i poured him another inch and put
the cork back in the bottle i watched
him rub his breast bone with great
tenderness as though savoring the
strength that came to him from the
burning sensation in his gullet his
shoulders squared back

  all right he said lets go to
work mitch

  we were hurrying across the court-
yard when the reverend prentiss
grabbed hudson the sun is setting
mr hudson the missionary said
you know of course that i intend to
do my part what shall i do 

  pray yelled bill hudson without
stopping pray mr prentiss

ed hardly got the gurkhas sta-
tioned at the front windows be-
fore ko-tsao started coming for his

gasoline there was the familiar stac-
cato stutter of machine guns and the
dust spurted in a snaky line along the
slope about a hundred yards in front
of us hudson had me straddle the
tripod of one of our own machine
guns and then ordered the gurkhas to
hold their fire until he gave the word

  for ten minutes we all suffered from
itching trigger fingers the chinese
machine gunner at the base of the hill
kept up his tattoo in intermittent
bursts he got the range after the first
few minutes and we could hear the
lead spatter against the thick masonry
walls of the compound a few bullets
splintered through our wooden shut-
ters ripped off the tiles of our roof
went screaming off into the fading
twilight after a while the machine-
gun fire stopped and we could barely
see the first line of skirmishers start
up the hill the flashes of their rifles
gave us the range if we wanted to open
fire but hudson wasnt ready yet the
crackle of rifles grew louder and the
room i was in was full of dust and
sound of breaking things as an oc-
casional bullet found its way in the
rifles were flickering about a hundred
yards away when hudson said give
it to em

  the tripod seat jumped and bucked
under me as my machine gun began
to yammer id loosened the swivel and
swept the leaping muzzle back and
forth through the full arc of the sector
bill hudson assigned me the other
machine gun was chattering and spit-
ting death from the opposite side of
the compound and in between the
rifles of the gurkhas were jerking and
barking across the window sills as fast
as the little brown men could work the
breechbolts my ears rang with the
deafening clamor and my nostrils
smarted with the acrid smell of burned


argosy

powder i dont know how long the
din kept up before hudson yelled
hold it

  the sudden silence hit my eardrums
with the same impact as a loud noise
it was several seconds before i could
distinguish any sounds outside in the
hot night-the sound of rapid foot-
steps panic-stricken feet running back
down the hill the long drawn-out wail
of some poor devil who had stopped
a slug out there in the darkness the
rout apparently was complete

  maybe thatll teach general flea i
wasnt bluffing said hudson hand
me that bottle mitch

  but general flea was not easily
convinced seven more waves of rifle-
men came surging up the hill during
the next few hours and each time
they got the same reception at regular
intervals we made flares of cotton
waste soaked in gasoline weighted
them and tossed them flaming down
the slope the flares prevented sur-
prise but they didnt prevent the re-
peated attacks of the soldiers of the
persistent ko-tsao and hudsons tac-
tics were always the same hold fire
until the raiders were within deadly
range then blast them into panic and
if youve never seen chinese soldiers
in panic youve never seen a panic

   it was nasty business all in all be-
cause a lot of ko-tsaos dollar-a-
month soldiers got taken down with
an overdose of lead but bill hudson
carried on with a sort of grim relish
between attacks hed come over for a
pull on my bottle and his lower jaw
never lost that pugnacious line of in-
spired hard-boiled courage that was
such a contrast with his usual shy
boyish smile i could tel he was think-
ing hard about tanner so as not to
feel too sorry for the chinese that kept
charging up the hill time after time

t ji te had a few casualties our-

  	 selves all of us were more or
less cut and scratched by splinters and
flying bits of masonry and four of our
gurkhas had stopped bullets three of
them enough to need first-aid from
one of the lady missionaries who knew
how to wrap bandages three of the
young men missionaries volunteered
to take the rifles of the wounded gurk-
has the rest of them piously manned
the harmonium and the chords of the
wheezy little organ pealing above their
thin reedy voices made a weird mys-
tical background for the rattle of gun-
fire and the cries of men in pain

  it was nearly midnight before ko
tsao realized the futility of direct at-
tack-at least without artillery or
grenades or air bombs which would
risk destroying our godoum full of
gasoline and thus defeat his own pur-
pose he finally managed to sneak a
machine-gun crew up the north slope
of the hill just out of range of our
flares we didnt know the gun was
there until it started raking our right
flank

  bill hudson didnt hesitate he
knew he had to act quickly because
our ammunition was running low and
our position would soon become un-
tenable if we had to split up our
meagre defending forces he took my
bottle up-ended it drained the last
drop wiped his mouth then he picked
three gurkhas told them to leave their
rifles and carry only their kukris-
those heavy curved knives they love
to use for close fighting then he said
mitch dont pay any attention to the
new riveter whos just moved in on
us from the north keep hammering
straight at the front when they start
up the hill again

then he and the three gurkhas
crossed the compound to the gate back
pot - valiant



of the go-down i waited nervously

  and a few minutes later the eighth
attack began by the smoky orange
light of our improvised flares i could
see that there were twice as many men
charging up the hill this time under
cover of the advance skirmish line a
second wave was bearing off to our
right obviously to complete the flank
attack started by that lone machine
gun i ignored it according to hud-
sons orders and opened fire dead
ahead

  by this time my ears were deaf to
the din i could feel rather than hear
the hammering of my machine gun as
i rode the kicking jiggling tripod
the barrel was so hot that i burned
the skin off my knuckles reloading and
the water was boiling and steaming in
the cooling jacket

  suddenly the ranks in front of us
wavered then broke the flanking de-
tachment came pouring back along the
north slope in full flight stumbling
flinging away their rifles yelling with
surprise and pain their own machine
gun had turned against them was
spraying them with a hail of steel-
jacketed death and before id fully
realized what had happened the eighth
attack was over

  a little later two of the gurkhas
came back to the compound packing
the captured machine gun the third
gurkha followed packing bill hud-
son who must have weighed fifty
pounds more than he did

  bills face was white as his teeth
which were clenched in agony one leg
of his trousers was crimson the mis-
sionaries put him to bed while i stayed
on the job at the front windows the
gurkhas would take orders from me
now 

there were no more orders to give
however we sat by our guns all night

but ko-tsao was at last convinced that
bill hudson wasnt bluffing

 a little after dawn seven
nationalist planes flew over in
a v formation i expected to see a
dog fight but none of ko-tsaos fliers
appeared he must have really needed
that gasoline he didnt get because he
was already moving on to get it else-
where his rear guard was two miles
away by ten oclock when the first of
the nationalist column reinforced by
the garrisons at pao-tung and pei-
ming-fu reentered the city

  wrhen it finally looked safe to lay
down our fowling pieces i went in to
see hudson he was awake lying there
all bandaged and smelling of antisep-
tic either his leg wasnt hurting him
as much or he was getting used to the
pain because he looked relaxed

  nice work last night bill i told
him and you cant kid yourself any
more that youre a coward

  he gave me a wan smile
pot-valiant he said dutch
courage or was it scotch

  scotch my eye i said it was
your own private brand of courage-
the guts you were born with

  that bottle- he started to say
that bottle i cut him off was
full of boiled water colored with soy
sauce and flavored with ginger and a
dash of worcestershire to make it
burn it was a fraud-but i wont
apologize

  hudson looked at me for a minute
perfectly blank then he began to
laugh it was the kind of laugh id
been wanting to hear from him for
months-hearty full-spirited genuine
and infectious he laughed so long
and so loud that the reverend david
prentiss came in the missionaries
were going home-all but mrs
- vv - 	 - 



argosy

prentiss who would stay and take care
of bill-and they wanted to shake
hands with mr hudson

  as they filed past bills bed the
reverend prentiss said to me we
have given thanks to the lord for this
new manifestation of divine good-
ness of the virtue of prayer we have
all been saved by our faith

  the reverend prentiss was right i
wont say for sure that it was his kind
of faith that saved us because thats
something i dont know anything
about maybe it was and maybe it
wasnt its outside my province and
beyond my ken but i will say that bill

hudson was saved by faith-faith in
himself that hed lost and found
again

  a couple of months later the taipan
from our shanghai office came
through on a tour of inspection at
dinner he proposed a toast to bill
hudson in acknowledgement bill
drank one swallow to be polite then
put down his glass

  whats the matter hudson the
taipan asked gone teetotaler on us
have you

  bill made a face and pushed his
glass away i never did like the taste
of the stuff he said

down to the sea in ovens

pinkles like the great auk have for so long been non-existent that when
henry ford looked around for one to put in his museum he couldnt find
one a pinky is neither a bird nor a flower but a boat and at millbridge on
the maine coast one is now being built for howard i chappelle a marine
architect and historian of early shipbuilding

  pinkies were noted for their comfort and seaworthiness and mr chapelle
notes that as long as they were used on the grand banks fisheries loss of life
was comparatively small they were two-masted schooners carrying mainsail
foresail one fore-staysail on a high bowsprit and sometimes one topsail they
were double-enders pointed fore and aft and their chief characteristic was
the pair of wide gunwales that formed bulwarks the entire length of the ship
and swept up in a curve to meet in a stern overhang

  a pinkys cabin called a cuddy was located under a raised section of the
deck forward and in some cuddies there were open fireplaces a few with
brick chimneys supposedly finnan haddie was discovered when a haddock
was hung in a pinky cuddy to dry it became smoked down east fishermen
still call sailing boats with cabins smoke boats

perry hilton staff photog-
rapher for the conservative chi-
cago chronicle was a long way
from home not so far when you meas-
ured the distance from chicago be-
cause it is only a few hundred miles
down the state from chicago to bur-
bank he was far from home because
he couldnt get out of burbank he was
marooned there

  burbank a thriving little river city
sits out on a point where the wabash
and the ohio rivers converge most

of the year it is a beautiful location
across the ohio you can see kentucky
across the wabash is the indiana
shore the scenery is wonderful in the
fall the weather is marvelous in the
summer and bracing in the winter
burbanks -fame as a lovely vacation
spot had gone out long before and
many had built homes in cheoke val-
ley and upon the knolls above the
metropolis

  but the night perry hilton sat in a
ramshackle chair with a broken leg on
its right side and its wicker seat half
fallen through was not a nice night for
burbank the season was neither sum-
mer autumn nor winter this was late


hell and high water



spring and terror rode the chilling
winds which swept down the great
mississippi and across the southern tip
of illinois

  the thaw had begun a week previous
and the rivers of the midwest swollen
rampant and fierce had backwatered
and flooded their banks when they
reached the hundreds of twisting
curves in their respective courses the
whole belt saw water-brown angry
water

  perry hilton sighed and stamped his
right foot several times he realized
suddenly that he was stiff and that it
had gotten much colder and that his big
toe ached

  he was sitting in the city room of
the burbank evening standard a
number of other men all newshawks
were there in the same room the
newshawks for the most part belonged
to the staffs of the evening standard
and the morning call both burbank
papers they were working together
striving with desperation to publish
some sort of newspaper for the benefit
of readers who would probably never
see a copy

  the merger was an emergency meas-
ure at the moment the morning calls
offices were inundated filled with filthy
river and black slime and everything
else which the wabash had picked up
in its turbulent path the call had been
situated downtown in the business dis-
trict unfortunately the business dis-
trict lay between the wabash and the
ohio and when the water rose the
business district had been the first to
know submersion

  perry hilton gritted his teeth as a
chill ate through him he stamped his
right foot several times and moved his
arms to keep warm it was dark and
gloomy in that city room the electric
power had faded twenty-four hours

previous the place looked as though
some one had stuck pinpoints of light
all over it hanging them right on the
blackness itself but these were the
tallow candles amber more or less
cheerful and smelling to high heaven
the room boasted the luxury of a kero-
sene lamp too but that was over on
the city editors desk where two men-
one from the morning paper and one
from the evening-were handling the
assignments and worrying about get-
ting the copy uptown to the printers

  perry didnt give a hoot about the
burbank papers he was there because
mr blaine managing editor of the
chicago chronicle had told him to
make the place his headquarters so that
he could be reached he wasnt the
only photographer from a chicago
paper to be sitting there with the
wabash and ohio rivers six feet deep
in the street outside

  there were a couple of association
men whom he knew slightly there was
also mr spudsy gill of the clarion a
sheet which did everything in the cruci-
fixion but drive the nails it was a scan-
dal rag full of daring dirty and bad
pictures it had the largest circulation
in the midwest

  spudsy was a funny guy perry re-
flected the man built short and squat
with long arms so that he resembled an
ape had the instincts of a gangster he
would have done anything to take a
picture he had done anything in the
past there was the time he took a pic-
ture of joe hooker worlds champ
when hooker was out with a dizzy
chorine at the black hawk one night
hooker hadnt liked the idea much and
hed gone after spudsy he broke
spudsys camera and was trying to
break spudsys nose that was all
right but when he tried to break the
exposed plate spudsy blew up and let


argosy

hooker have one with a sap it all but
fractured the champs skull and spudsy
nearly spent time in a hoosegow for the
job but he saved his picture he was
that way

derry glanced over at spudsy gill
who was asleep in a chair his head
down under his overcoat like a birds
head under a wing the trouble with
spudsy perry hilton thought was
that he had no ethics in photography at
all and the same went for max fer-
ron a gangling thin man with specs
who worked for the star-call max
was picking his teeth between drags on
a cigarette and also lou drake of
the dispatch a hairless man who
chewed constantly on a dead cigar

  perry frowned they were all rough-
necks at best no wonder news photog-
raphers had such a bad reputation you
couldnt blame a man like j p mor-
gan for carrying a bodyguard around
with him to take care of fotogs like
spudsy gill news fotogs needed
ethics that was the hitch-no decency

  over at the city desk the telephone
rang it sounded shrill and noisy in the
silence of the room and everyone
stirred expectantly at its voice spudsy
gill woke up and yawned broadly he
asked  whos it for chief

  perry straightened in his chair and
stretched the muscles of his back they
were cramped and cold he hadnt
changed his clothes in two days now
and he felt disreputable he knew he
shouldnt mind there was no way of
getting back to the hotel which was
now underwater up to the second floor
downtown and after all they said at
the circle of confusion club in chi-
cago that spudsy gill actually slept in
his clothes all the time with his camera
and his flash bulbs right at hand so
that he could rip out on a beat at a mo-

ments notice wearing the same
clothes for two days was small beer
compared to that

   still perry thought it was inelegant
hed always prided himself upon his
dressing immaculately now his shoes
were soaking wet and covered with
slime and his trouser legs would never
be clean again his tie was ruined and
his coat spotted and his gloves were a
mess it really was distasteful

   of course there was a flood in the
vicinity and if a man had gone out in
plain shorts hed probably been given
a medal for good common sense but
to perry hilton that made no differ-
ence

   the man at the city desk said chi-
cago calling perry hilton

   perry got up grunting a little be-
cause he was stiff and walked over to
the city desk with its luxurious kero-
sene lamp spudsy gill grinning owl-
ishly and showing his gold tooth which
caught the light of the candles eerily
sauntered after him

   perry picked up the phone and stared
at spudsy who was trying to get his
ear as close as possible to the receiver
the man said it was for me spudsy

  spudsy looked pained aw now
duke he said aint it ethical for me
to drop an ear in and he grinned

  perry shrugged and said hello it
was mr blaine hello perry blaine
said his voice was miles distant and
the wire crackled as though it would
burn up

   i cant hear you perry said

   i said hello mr blaine replied in
a louder voice its the connection
very bad wonder i can reach you at
all    listen perry

  okay now perry said

   you  have to figure a new way of
shooting any more pictures up mr
blaine said phil just got in with the
hell and high water



last batch and says he cant get through
again he cant get back weve had
word from the c c c  st louis
that the right of way has washed out
ten miles north of burbank no more
trains going in there

  no more trains perry snapped
and the roads are gone how are we
fixed mr blaine

  youre absolutely cut off mr
blaine said the last ap flash said
that the wabash had gone across the
valley north of burbank and has met
the ohio on the other side burbank is
out on a limb the levees are holding
and thats the only thing thats saving
the city and cheoke valley red cross
trying to get supplies in but may have
to drop em by plane when the weather
lets up

  but how about film perry asked
worried ive only got about two
dozen negatives left film packs thats
no film for this setup i need more and

i	cant get it

   well get supplies to you as soon as
we can why dont you try the stores
there any open  no well do
your best perry make your negatives
count its a jam we cant do anything
on either side were lucky the wires
are still up theyll probably go before
dawn perry wait a second wait a
second just got a flash-

  perry held the phone and took a
couple of breaths spudsy gill snick-
ered and shook his head youre down
to a pair of film packs duke he said
max ferron is down to five negatives
and lou drake and me were out al-
together and you should kick
burbanks cut off from the rest of
illinois perry told him this town
is in a tough spot

   hello hello perry mr blaine cut
in get this now another ap flash
army engineers fear that the wabashs

crest may endanger the whole city
down there if worst comes to worst
theyll dynamite the levees in the east
and divert the wabash into cheoke
valley theyre putting it on the air
now to warn the citizens in the valley
to go up for higher grounds and
heres an assignment ive just been
tipped off that old man beard-you
know-jonathan beard the steel
man-

  you mean the millionaire perry
asked

  one and the same hes at his coun-
try place in the cheoke valley he
went there two weeks ago for seclu-
sion with his six-year-old grand-daugh-
ter after the kid was threatened with
kidnapping hes still there listen
perry youve got a chance for a beau-
tiful job get down into the valley and
see jonathan beard and the kid and
get me some pictures get me some-

mr blaine suddenly stopped
speaking perry hammered the
telephone hook and said hello three
times no answer then a terrific
crackling ear-splitting in its din took
over the wires followed by a metallic
explosion

  spudsy gill shook his dirty face and
stopped grinning he said that wire
is shot perry ill bet you five fish we
dont get any more outside calls

  but he was just talking- perry
began but the operator cut him off
with im sorry your party has been
disconnected the trunk lines are down
you can still make local calls

  never mind said perry call it
a night and he hung up

  i heard the crack from here said
spudsy aint this a nice pickle
marooned in a marooned burg no out-
side phone no railroad the weather too
dirty for flying and swell for ducks


argosy

only there aint no ducks what are
you going to do perry spudsy
grinned broadly then i mean what is
the ethical thing to do duke

   ive got to get out of here perry
said what time is it anyhow 

  four g m said spudsy gill he
yawned and stretched his arms he re-
minded perry of a picture of a gorilla
he had once seen its arms strung up
on poles making the dead figure look
as though it were alive and stretching
only the gorilla had had a better look-
ing face than spudsys mashed one

   perry went back to his chair but he
didnt sit down he opened his black
oblong equipment case and had a look

  his precious speed graphic was in
there with its kalart speedgun attached
and synchronized to the shutter a
number two photoflash bulb was sitting
tightly in the speedgun socket all
ready to burst into its three thousand
lumens of light there were two car-
tons of photoflash bulbs beside each
carton carrying six bulbs that meant
twelve possible pictures in blackness
there were the two film packs enough
negative for twenty-four pictures
there was a tripod which he hadnt
been able to use at all and there was
-he didnt know why on earth it was
there-some velox printing paper
sensitized paper for contact printing
making the actual picture from a nega-
tive in a darkroom after the negative
had been developed and dried

   he checked through it all then slung
the case on his shoulder and put on his
gloves spudsy gill watched him sharp-
ly max ferron stared at him and said
whats up

  dont ask him lou drake said
that guy is ethical he wouldnt tip
off a couple of his fotog pals if he lost
an arm besides its a lousy night and
not worth the trouble and negatives

are low and if i take any more shots
of this high water itll be by day
ill see you all later perry said
spudsy gill rubbing his chin fol-
lowed perry to the window past the
city desk look my ethical chum he
clowned the water outside that win-
dow is about ten feet deep you cant
get out of this shebang without a boat
i know perry said im hoping
somebody goes by

   i can do better than that

  what do you mean spudsy
look duke spudsy said serious-
ly youre a funny guy you think a
guy can be a news photographer and
still be polite ive been in the racket
for twelve years see  and i know you
gotta be a roughneck to deliver the
goods never trust another guy cut
his throat before he cuts yours thats
the way to get pictures

   perry said well

  well   spudsy stopped to light
a cigarette heres one spot your
ethics dont work i can get a boat
you need a boat you got to get to
cheoke valley i could take you there
you dont know the way-

  how did you-

  i heard blaine on the phone
spudsy said i got a big ear duke
whefi it comes to exclusiveness so how
about it 

  about what

   ill get the boat and ferry you to
cheoke valley and you split that film
pack with me i aint got a negative
left in the camera no negatives for
spudsy no boat for the duke

   perry hesitated the tip from blaine
was exclusive but even an exclusive
wasnt worth anything if you didnt
get to the subject to shoot it what
were the ethics here  spudsys proposi-
tion was fair enough not that he
trusted spudsy farther than he could
hell and high water



throw a piano ill give you half a
dozen negatives perry said and its
a deal

  sure said spudsy a good man
like me dont need more than six gela-
tins only a guy with ethics-an ama-
choor so to speak-needs a reserve
he stopped grinning lets lam
weve got a trip

ii

rpihe night was filled with a deafen-
ing roar and the weight of a river
gone mad the flying scud thick and
sooty and wet whipped down on them
as perry hilton and spudsy gill
clambered from the evening standard
building to the top of a theatre
marquee deserted and dark the wind
was roaring almost as much as the run-
ning waters which flooded the street
and carried its cargo of twisted wreck-
age and-sometimes-human bodies to
and fro in a swirling aimlessness   

  it was a dark dead city burbank
no electric lights to stud the stygian
gloom no moon no stars no sign of
life only the wind-whipped waters
and the stinging bullets of rain
which splattered down with fecundity
drenching the drowning metropolis

  from the top of the marquee-the
foul waters barely washing the last
letters of its dead electric sign double
feature today-perry peered through
the mists which clung to his eyes he
tried to look down town to see the city
which had so busily fought to
strengthen its levees and keep its thriv-
ing centers free from high water that
had been days before

  now the place was a raucous tomb
the megaphone of many voices the lap-
ping waters and crying wind and thud-
ding wreckage

he could see nothing downtown

southward all of it was gone swal-
lowed alive by the rapacious night

  spudsy hit his shoulder and yelled
they got twenty-two feet of water
down there and still rising

  perry shuddered blaine said the
army might dynamite the levees and let
the wabash go through cheoke he
yelled back that would ease the pres-
sure at the fork and let the waters re-
cede some it might keep the crest from
breaking over the levees

  theyll have to do it spudsy
cried theyll have to do it or the crest
of the wabash will wash right in and
you wont ever see this burg again
wheres the boat

  right here on the marquee ill
show you

  spudsy gill his dirty trench coat
thrust between his legs by the battering
wind stumbled across the marquee to
the opposite side perry followed
fighting to keep his balance as the gale
caught his equipment case behind his
shoulder and tried to spin it around
when he reached spudsy spudsy was
kneeling down perry knelt too

   it was the corner of the marquee and
there was some slight respite from the
needle-like rain right here said
spudsy hoarsely right under this tar-
paulin

  your own  perry gasped

  paid a guy a hundred bucks for it
day before yesterday spudsy said
five sawbucks for a scow like this
i hope it floats i locked it to the
marquee cables here duck a tin pail
came flying by them and crashed into
the theatre front with a terrific smash
it fell into the eddying water below
wrong side up and immediately sank
from sight

  spudsy gill sighed i dunno i
think were nuts no rag is worth
shooting pictures for on a night like


argosy

this were crazy we oughta go back
to the office and keep our tootsies
warm

  i cant perry said soberly mr
blaine asked me to get these pictures
if humanly possible

  spudsy looked disgusted you and
your ethics he snapped its all right
for your mr blaine to ask for pictures
he dont have to risk his neck for a
couple of shots of a millionaire and his
granddaughter which wont be remem-
bered more than a day if you get them
at all old johnathan beardll pose for
you maybe and youll take a shot
then blaine will caption it millionaire
evacuating home in flood area and
thatll be that    remember perry
the readers aint gonna see this skiff
and this wind and rain and this hell
and high water and you getting your
gams wet and catching cold and damn
near drowning

  perry smiled i thought you were
the hard-boiled guy spudsy who got
the foto at any price

  i am spudsy snarled but i also
got brains enough to know when to
stop trying if i werent afraid that
you might catch something big and
show me up- he cursed underbreath
all right lets launch the queen mary
here and get under way

  right

  they pulled the tarpaulin off the
boat it was a small job and perry felt
a little colder when he saw it and his
stomach got very numb it couldnt
have taken more than two people being
no more than eight feet long it was
flat-bottomed low-sided and had a pair
of oars which were badly splintered on
the blades it needed a paint job badly
and perry wondered at the moment
how long it would float

  spudsy gill unlocked the chain
which fastened the craft to the marquee

cable and fixed an open hitch you
row duke he said you got the old
muscle me i aint been living right
he coughed in a bad imitation be-
sides you were the guy who crewed at
collitch no

  okay perry said grimly lets
get the scow in the water and make a
try

tach took an end spudsy got the
 bow which was lighter and they
slid the skiff up over the marquee edge
careful when you drop her perry
snapped we dont want any water in
her shes bad enough as is

   right

  all together-drop

   they let go the skiff fell about three
feet and when it struck the water it
made a hollow plop and pushed two
combs of water out on either side of
the beam

  come on spudsy yelled leaping
from the marquee he landed in the
stern and for a second perry wondered
whether or not the bottom might fall
out of the dory from the shock there
was a swish of water again from under
the hull and spudsy quickly fell down
to the seat dragging his covered
camera with him throw me my
bulbs

  perry tossed down spudsys half-a-
dozen flash bulbs then lowered his own
gleaming wet equipment case into the
bottom and stepped down from the
marquee to the rowers thwart spudsy
cast loose the chain perry picked up
the right oar braced it against the mar-
quee and shoved them out into the in-
undated street then he got both oars
in the locks and steadied the skiff in
the current mindful of the sodden
thuds against the sides of the boat
where jetsam struck now and then
which way he yelled at spudsy
hell and high water



on the rear thwart out in the street
the current was swift and the wind got
in its work and sound and carried his
voice back into his throat as he faced
its stiffness and slanting rain which
way spudsy

  spudsy leaned forward cupping his
hands around his mouth head the
way she stands now north i can see
torches way up there-must be on dry
ground-or even wet ground in this
rain up on the hill where the water
hasnt reached yet torches can you
make it

  perry didnt know the answer to that
one he began to row aware that his
trousers were definitely ruined he
glanced at the soaked and grimy legs
in regret and wondered whether or not
mr kennebonk in the bookkeeping de-
partment would allow him a new suit
on the expense account it seemed the
ethical thing to do for him after all
he had spoiled this one on behalf of the
chronicle

  he rowed in long strong sweeping
pulls feathering his oars on the thrust
and clicking the blades over vertically
when he dipped them the little boat
jerked ahead rythmically with his
strokes spudsys head rocking on his
shoulders with each quick spurt
spudsy kept saying little to the
right   hold it   straight ahead my
fine tar anchors a weigh    hold it   
to the left   big oil barrel    watch
it  heave ho my hearty    come on
you lazy salt give it the works  

   perry let the little ape rave on the
sound of spudsy gills voice made the
night seem less tangible gave the skiff
something of the air of a backroom
spudsy was taut enough in the gloom
to sound soberly tight even if he hadnt
had a drink in two days

  they moved northward with star-
tling speed and perry knew his

prowess at the oars was hardly respon-
sible it was something like having a
tail wind in a plane and a lucky break
they could see barrels and wagons
float by now and then and once they
hit the submerged top of a stranded
car perry felt the hair rise on his neck
as the bow went up then slid off

  whew spudsy whistled close
but no cee-gar take it easy duke
were almost there i can see high
ground and men-soldiers up there-
keep on a-rowing tar keep on a-row-
in

  perry gritted his teeth his arms
were aching a little and he felt cold
he flexed his fingers a little and kept
straining his face hurt where the
spears of rain lanced against his cheeks
and sometimes stung his eyes beneath
the brim of his dismal hat all this for
a snapshot-thats what it would
amount to-of a millionaire who prob-
ably wouldnt be found

   oh well   

tt took a long time an awfully
long time perry was panting when
they finally grounded the crunch of
the boats bow against the gritty wet
dirt-ground above water-was the
sweetest music his ears had ever heard

  hop out spudsy called out and
beach her

  perry picked up his equipment case
and put it out on the ground and then
raised up the bow and pulled the boat
far up on land in the stern spudsy
began to let go a display of verbal fire-
works he came out of that boat like
an athlete clinging to his camera and
flash bulbs

   you dirty so and so he told perry
you raised her nose up so high you
let water in over the back seat and wet
my fanny a fine thing people will
think im in my second childhood or


argosy

something look here comes the
army

  they plodded up the knoll to meet
the two soldiers who ran down to see
them there were bright torches on the
hill and a sign across the road block-
ing it perry saw one of the soldiers
was a lieutenant the other who car-
ried a rifle was a private the lieuten-
ant called to them

  you men he said did you come
up from the city

  were news cameramen perry
hilton explained yes we just came
up from vine street in the boat

  the lieutenant frowned bad down
there

  it aint good exactly said spudsy
waters getting higher uptown all the
time i guess most of the people are
out huh

  the lieutenant nodded all gone up
to the hotel on pike hill over there
thatll probably be the only dry spot
around here for a day or two this is
a helluva thing we need more men
in here but they cant get through now
you didnt see any looting

  brother said spudsy theres
nothing to loot its all under water if
id found a film store id have looted
it and damned your wet bullets-i need
film that bad no mister the rivers
have the situation well in hand down-
town  

  look perry said which way to
cheoke valley

  straight ahead said the lieu-
tenant it begins after pike hill there
you can look down into the valley
from the hill    hey you guys arent
going down into cheoke valley are
you why ive got my men down in
there now evacuating the place were
going to dynamite the north levee at
six this morning and fill that valley
with the wabash river you keep out

  wait a second perry said you
dont understand this weve got to go
down into the valley well get out of
it before six this is an assignment for
our papers we understand your warn-
ing and well get out in time

  yeah spudsy said fervently
you dont have to worry about that
none mister

  youre both crazy said the
soldier dont know when youre well
off well go ahead but dont say i
didnt tell you up she goes at six bells
and that valley will be a river fastern
johnstown became wet on your way
they left the lieutenant and his rifle-
man and plodded up the muddy road
toward pike hill the road was lighted
by torches along the way every now
and then and it wasnt so bad the
lightning began to scissor the sky now
too sheet lightning glary flaring
across heaven without the benefit of
thunder when it detonated sound-
lessly they could see the white skin of
the hotel on the crest of the hill with
its leafless trees standing out against
the horizon like black skeletons be-
seeching the sky

   the rain stopped its intensified fall
and changed to a mizzling curtain like
opaque fog it felt a little better but
just about killed visibility when they
reached the summit of pike hill they
avoided the turn into the hotel grounds
and started on down the other side into
cheoke valley itself

  this spudsy gill grunted as they
plodded on is just like stepping down
into your own grave and knowing ex-
actly what youre doing

  dont lose your nerve perry said
well get out of here before six
lose my nerve spudsy laughed
harshly i never lost my nerve in my
life he laughed again it wouldnt
be ethical for a fotog to lose his nerve
hell and high water



would it duke but i dont have to
like this setup one bit and brother
rat i dont

  a nother soldier loomed up out
of the scud and perry choked
back an ejaculation of surprise the
fellow came out of the gloom like a
risen corpse and looked very white
when he bumped into them being just
as scared

hey you guys he gasped get
outa here getn the hell outa here
so we were told previously perry
said well get out in time soldier
how is the evacuation going

  bad said the soldier boy you
try finding houses in this soup and
telling people to scram they just wont
do it they just wont believe were
really gonna blast

  but you are spudsy said making
it a query

  doggone right we are said the
soldier you newsguys thought so
well get this i was up on the north
levee about two this morning when it
was pouring cats and dogs and there
was major renot of the th
engineers says he if we dont blast
this levee soon the wabash is gonna
meet the ohio and back right up to
lake michigan and you wont save a
soul if we do blast well ease the pres-
sure and save the city so another guy
-a shavetail-he says but major
what about the people in the valley
and the major just spits once and
says theres thirty thousand people in
that city and theres maybe a thousand
in the valley evacuate the valley and
well blow this levee out at dawn 
the soldier paused and drew long
breaths but the doggone fools just
wont get out theyll drown sure
look said perry which way to
the jonathan beard estate soldier

  that the big castle down there
asked the soldier

  doubtless spudsy remarked
doubtless general

  funny guy huh anyway you go
down this road until you come to a
sign says millstone turnpike then
go left the castle is up on the other
side of the hill aint in the valley floor
its up a little higher than most youll
find it

  thanks perry said

  and remember six bells and bam 
how asked spudsy with a sigh
could we forget

   they left the soldier and plodded on
the farther they went the darker it
got but the sheet lightning showed
them the road intermittently and the
going wasnt hard at all as they pro-
gressed into the valley hollow the
ground began to get soft and marshy

  finally they reached the signpost-
millstone turnpike they kept to the
left and started across the valley floor
itself it began to rain again first in
sweeping gusts and then in a sudden
and breathtaking downpour which
soaked through their coats and
drenched them to the skin with its cold
penetration

  the wind wasnt strong down here
though perry hilton in the lead sud-
denly stopped walking and snapped
wait a second

  for cryin out loud said spudsy
gasping dont do that my nerves
arent so hot and this hole is a ban-
shee stamping ground if its anything
at all

  keep quiet perry said i heard
something

  wh-what

  listen

  they stood stockstill listening at
first there was nothing except the si-
lence of many noises the falling rain


argosy

the whistling wind the faint distant
ranting of the angry rivers and the re-
mote grumbling of faraway thunder

  spudsy gill shivered and swung his
free arm flexing his fingers i hear
plenty and i dont hear nothing
listen

   they both heard it then as the wind
dropped for a second the cry weak
and tremulous reached them on its
faintest volume barely audible above
the conglomeration of other sounds
the word was help- it sent an
electric tingle coursing down perrys
back so that he twitched sharply as
though from a violent chill

  spudsy he said sharply come
on its over here it came from this
way

  i heard it- spudsy replied go
ahead ill follow you

   they ran as fast as they could in the
dark presently they stopped perry
called hello anybody there
yes replied a voice in the gloom
right here hurry please straight
ahead-i think i can see you please
hurry

  they ran they hadnt gone twenty
feet when spudsy fell flat on his face
cussed like a trooper then fell strangely
still for a few seconds and finally
screeched perry

  perry went back to him where are
you spudsy

  right at your f-f-feet spudsy
choked duke-listen-i tripped on
something-i think-

  what

   i-uh-i think its a stiff spudsy
chattered you got a light

  your own matches perry said
how about them

  soaking wet

   perry heard spudsys teeth chatter-
ing ive got my storm lighter he
said wait a second he reached into

his wet clothes and pulled the lighter
out he stooped down beside spudsy
and spun the flint wheel the lighter
ignited on the first try

gawd spudsy breathed in horror
in the xanthic light they saw a
corpse it was a soldier a non-com
with a rifle strung across his back and
a  caliber colt pistol in his hand

 his tin hat was next to his head its
turtle-back down so that it looked like
a rain bowl there was a bullet hole in
the soldiers head and there were blood
stains all over his rain-drenched chest
he had blue eyes which were wide
open like his mouth

  gawd spudsy said again some-
body bumped him

   please please    the helpless
voice cried again so close now that
perry hilton and spudsy both spun
around

  the lighter illumined the owner of
the voice it was a girl young and
good-looking she was lying on her
back her head raised up to spot them
she wasnt more than ten feet from
the soldiers corpse she looked scared

ill

the cigarette lighter was weaken-
ing perry walked over to the girl
and knelt down beside her what is
it he asked whats wrong this
lighters fading

  my foot she gasped i was run-
ning i stepped in a hole-cant get my
foot out

  ankle sprained do you think
  no at least the foot doesnt hurt

i think its just stuck if you could dig
around-

  perry got a better look it was a
fox hole the foot was wedged in
tightly and there wasnt much the girl
could do about it perry found a thin
hell and high water



sharp rock and began to pound the
earth around the hole until it finally
gave away still the shoe remained
wedged he had to yank on her leg
before she made it

   the lighter went out the girl didnt
get right up she waited a minute
while circulation went back into the
foot she said briefly thanks loads
ill be all right in a second and then
fell silent perry heard spudsy rum-
maging in the equipment case

  whats on your mind

   i gotta get a foto of that stiff
spudsy said gimme the film you
promised

   wait a second perry reached in
and pulled out one of the packs and
handed it to spudsy only six of
those that was the deal

  did i say no

  and look perry said load my
graphic and grab me a shot too -will
you ive got to help this girl

   sure duke said spudsy with un-
natural spontaneity anything for an
ethical pal

  perry went back and knelt beside
her it was dark of course and he
couldnt see her face but he could re-
member its soft white oval and the
clean trim features flanked by wet
brown hair her eyes had been blue
he recalled blue and big x-re you bet-
ter now he asked im perry hil-
ton news photographer for the chi-
cago chronicle the anthropoid with
me is named spudsy gill

   he felt her hand grasp his arm in
the dark as she got to her feet my
name is sherwood she said quietly
ann sherwood its coincidental but
im a newspaperwoman

  ann sherwood said perry of
course you are youre on the new
york planet ive seen your stuff-a
good colyum

  thanks he saw her smiling
wryly as one of spudsys flashes went
off painting the dead man in its blue-
white light which came and went at
one-fiftieth of a second ive got to
find a telegraph office

  nerts spudsy called over in the
dark there aint no wtire service outa
burbank now lady what you want
is a radio thats the only connection
there was another flash and theres
your picture perry and i hope it aint
as good as mine a pause ill stick
your camera back in the case

  thanks perry said he found the
girl in the dark i think youd better
come along with us miss sherwood
were trying to reach the jonathan
beard estate weve got to get out of
this valley soon you knew they were
going to dynamite the levee and flood
all this didnt you

  good lord-no she gasped i
might have been-well-its all right
now if you hadnt come along
though-

  come on spudsy said i dont
hanker to get wetted down with the
wabash lets go

  they went back to the road and
across the valley they talked what
about that dead man perry asked
her

  sorry ann sherwood replied
thats my story

  thats what i like said spudsy
dryly gratitude   

   shut up perry said shes right
it is her yarn she covered it and its
hers thats ethical

   the devil it is you saved her life
didnt you she wouldnt report any-
thing if you hadnt heard her then
she chisels you out of a yarn-ethics
besides she might have bumped that
guy herself how do we know
dont mind him perry said he


argosy

wants the yarn for his own paper at
my expense

  no she said suddenly hes
right mr hilton

  perry ill call you ann saves
time

  right but ill talk you two-well
its not so exclusive at that rogue
donaven killed that soldier but that
isnt new rogue donavens killed
three men in the last twelve hours
rogue donaven perry exclaimed
did you hear that spudsy

  rogue donaven spudsy sounded
awed but he broke prison at crown
hill indiana last week that wras be-
fore we even came down to this under-
water town

rphats right ann sherwood
said he kept undercover until
thursday then a pair of federal men
recognized him and hes been on the
lam ever since when my managing
editor sent me on here to cover the
flood i came into a nice tip from one
of the g-men up at roseville ten miles
north he said rogue donaven was in
that section hiding out yesterday they
flushed him and he came south i-
my friend tipped me again and i came
too donaven left a red trail behind
him all the way to burbank killed
three policemen-

  burbank cried spudsy as if a
flood wasnt bad enough we have to
have a nice cold killer loose at the same
time i know i took a picture of that
rat once when he was nabbed in chi
he just looked at me and said  i croak
guys who take pictures of me and he
meant it what happened tonight

  they trailed him into cheoke val-
ley around midnight but the fog came
down then and they lost him for
awhile about two hours ago they ran
into him down at the turnpike there

was a gunfight they all chased him
into the dark and i came along in the
rear that soldier-i guess he heard
the shots and came to have a look
anyway rogue donaven doubled back
on his own trail and ran right into the
soldier-his name was dugan-and
me he shot dugan three times and i
ran and he fired once at me just after
i fell i kept quiet and he went off
gosh spudsy said

  which way did he go asked
perry

  her voice was steady this way
the way were going

  simultaneously in the quick radium-
like luminescence of a brilliant sheet of
lightning the castle of jonathan beard
formed itself out of the fog and night
the thunder spoke more abruptly and
more boldly now and the rain came
down in sheeted torrents id offer
you my coat perry said to ann sher-
wood but its as dry as a piece of
seaweed and would only weigh you
down

  she laughed and touched his arm
thanks perry but i couldnt be any
wetter is that the place

  looks like it perry replied
squinting through the rain i dont
see any lights at all do you 

  i think- spudsy started to say
the earth shook under their feet
a curious lull followed during which
they all stood transfixed the wind
seemed to have died and they did not
feel the rain then they heard the
sound so much slower finally reach-
ing them across the valley boom hol-
low and yet heavy with a peculiar
cadence and concussion twice more
then that shudder and the awful
booms

  ann clung to perrys arm while
spudsy shouted for gods sake you
dont think-
hell and high water



  from the north perry yelled
the north levee

  instinctively they looked back the
way they had come slate dawn dirty
wet with the falling rain was slowly
tiptoeing across the footbridge of the
east long delayed and very reluctant

  from die north levee a voice began
to speak first in an ominous mutter
which reached their ears plainly then
rising up into a fierce roar and finally
reaching a thunderous crescendo of un-
abated fury which shamed the honest
thunder of the storm

  gawd spudsy screamed theyve
dynamited the levee

  perry yelled they cant have it
isnt time what time is it anyway
we couldnt have made such a mis-
take

  the lightning flared and ann sher-
wood saw her watch she said shrilly
its five oclock its only five
oclock

  daylight saving spudsy shrieked
dont you see those soldiers are
from fort monmouth and theyre on
daylight saving time theyre going
by their own watches on the whole
thing and were an hour out of the
way

  perry heard the panic in spudsy
gills voice and he fought it down in
his own heart all right he said
lets get going we cant make it
back to pike hill only thing to do is
take refuge in jonathan beards castle
up on the hill there and pray to md
the water doesnt go higher than the
towers come on

iv

the front door of the great stone
house of jonathan beard was wide
open none of them-perry ann
spudsy-stopped to question why

they dashed in spudsy gill slamming
the door hard behind him and think-
ing at the same time that it would hold
back the muddy waters for a few
minutes and give him some time he
never considered the windows

  in the center hall of the mansion
where it was black as pitch when the
lightnings died they came to a halt
halloo perry called anybody
here 

  upstairs came a voice gruff and
excited for heavens sake dont
stand down there come up stairs and
hurry

  they skipped up the stairs spudsy
taking a quick lead and perry pushing
ann sherwood along they couldnt
see a thing and the sky remained dark
without flashes for a long time they
reached the top of the stairs and stood
on the landing

  cant see spudsy said hoarsely

  perry tried the lighter it wouldnt
work he said try a photoflash
spudsy itll give us bearings

  spudsy stuck a bulb in his speedgun
and flashed the lighter flared and died
quickly but perry spotted the next
staircase and dragged them over to it
they climbed again

  and now outside the house the
earth was gripped in a roaring rush of
mad water they could not see it but
they could feel it feel its vibrations
throagh the stone of the house
charging the air itself and filling them
up with a tense expectancy

  gotta get a shot spudsy groaned
half the wabash river tearing
through this valley    gotta get a
picture    hurry up hurry up-

  there were lights at the top of the
second landing they rushed toward
them and reached a circular room in
the north tower of the huge house
the light was the emanation of four


argosy

long tallow candles mounted on a table
in sterling silver candelabras

  there were two people in the tower
room an elderly white-haired man of
about sixty-five a six-year-old girl
with a pretty moon face and short
blonde curls perry recognized them
both the man was jonathan beard
worth forty-two million dollars re-
tired steel magnate as grizzled an old
warrior as industry had ever spawned
the child was cynthia beard heir ap-
parent to the forty-two million dollars
less income tax

  she sat in her grandfathersjap not
very frightened really her eyes wide
with surprise as she stared out the win-
dow into the maelstrom which had
eaten up cheoke valley in her left
arm she had clenched a duck it was
apparent that his name was donald
and that he was the progeny of a mr
disney he was dressed like a sailor
and had his head cocked to one side as
if to say iz zat so in her other
hand cynthia beard was clenching a
big old-fashioned brownie camera an
eastman-kodak product vintage of
 taking a  roll film it was a
battered job perry could see that it
had put thousands of snapshots behind
its fixed lens he smiled the child
looked so small for such a big box
camera and he wondered why-of all
her toys-she had chosen to save the
brownie along with donald duck

  hello jonathan beard said in a
husky voice glad you made it you
did just about you know we watched
you from the window here saw you
come across the field there was an-
other man too where is he 

  perry said no there wasnt any-
one else not as far as we know

  oh but there was said beard
earnestly perhaps-i presume he
didnt make it who are you

 aty name is hilton perry said

   j- a this is gill were press pho-
 tographers had an assignment to get
 out here and take some pictures of you
 but we got caught short this is miss
 sherwood a new york newspaper-
 woman covering the flood

   beard smiled the flood seems to
 have the upper hand with you miss
 sherwood do sit down you gentle-
 men are saying you came all the way
 from burbank risking your lives for
 pictures of me

 with the granddaughter spudsy
 said look pretty now and he
 flashed a bulb and startled the child
 perry wheeled on him and snapped
 whats the matter with you anyhow 
 cant you wait until mr beard says
 all right

   not me duke spudsy snarled
 im a fotog see i dont have ethics
 but i get the pictures go lay an egg
 never mind hilton beard said
 frowning at spudsy go ahead and
 take your picture it seems little enough
 after your trip here

   but sir perry asked why on
 earth are you still here  didnt you
 get a warning werent you asked to
 go to higher ground at pikes hill 
 the servants are all gone beard
 explained quietly all in panic im
 an elderly man mr hilton not built
 for running around at night in such
 a storm and this child-as a matter
 of fact i thought and still think that
 the house here is the safest place this
 side of the valley the water will reach
 the house yes but i dont think it will
 ever inundate the lace to any extent
 and this house will easily withstand
 the rush of water it was built to with-
 stand anything

  yeah spudsy gill was at the
 other window hed leveled his speed
 graphic and left the lens open on time

                	a-
hell and high water



a lightning flash had made a picture
for him and he closed the lens listen
mister it may have been built right
but it wouldnt withstand that stuff if
the water gets high enough take a
look when the lightning breaks

  they all crowded to the windows
the lightning flared they saw the
valley below them saw it all in every
bit of its terrifying aspect they saw
the huge wall of filthy black water
which came down the valley like an
express train cushioning itself up on
the slopes on either side and sweeping
everything in its path they saw four
white clapboard houses one upside
down being hurled down the torrent
with splintering crushing force they
saw the three empty tank cars the
empty tanks having made the steel cars
buoyant floating down on the wash
like little corks their road insignias
quite plain csw lines

  they saw all that and the room grew
still as they watched the water crawl
up and up the slope reaching out its
watery fringe for the beard estate and
nearing the level of the houses base
all the time once-in a flash-they
saw the big hotel atop pike hill across
the valley it looked so safe no river
could ever reach it

  perry broke the grim silence per-
haps id better get my pictures now-
if you dont mind mr beard and i
really shouldnt miss that torrent al-
though it will never reproduce as it is
with its sound

  thats what is frightening  ai
sherwood whispered the uproar and
the madness of it all  

  spudsy had been taking quite a few
pictures and perry suddenly recalled
that he had given only six negatives
to the little ape-man with the gold
tooth his face clouded spudsy saw
the look and began to fade into the

 	a-

shadows perry crossed the room and
went for his equipment case before
he reached it he was stopped

  hold it you muggs said the
voice we got to get a couple of
things straight hold it

t t was not a nice voice it was sharp
coarse dangerous perry turned
slowly and saw the man in the door-
way the candles illumined his fea-
tures very plainly it was a harsh gaunt
face with a long purplish scar quite
colorful from the cold rain on it down
the side of the mans right cheek no
hat no tie his clothes a complete
wreck the stranger stood in the door-
way motionless as a statue a glisten-
ing nickel-plated revolver in his right
hand

  gawd spudsy gill said sharply
the first to break the cold spell its
him-rogue donaven

  rogue donavens scar jerked and he
snapped his head and gun around
spudsy meanwhile had instinctively
sighted his graphic and he pressed the
release which flashed the bulb and took
the picture

  rogue donavens eyes disappeared
under his brows he said briefly i
croak guys what take pictures of me
and he raised the revolver and fired
once

  the slug went clean through the
graphics valuable lens punctured the
film in the back of the camera broke
through the back itself and pinked into
spudsy gills chest knocking the cam-
era from his hands and thrusting him
down to the floor on his knees from
where he fell headlong to his face

  perry took two quick steps toward
donaven but stopped when the gun
hit a line with his stomach you want
some too  rogue donaven asked

  perry ajin sherwood gasped


argosy

for gods sake perry dont-

  the ladys right hilton said
jonathan beard dont be foolish
cynthia beard startled by the ear-
splitting crack of the gun and the flame
which had jumped at spudsy was cry-
ing beard tried to comfort her

  perry halted his arms hanging
loosely at his sides this certainly he
figured was the hour for ethics he
asked quietly have you any objec-
tion to my examining my ffjnd
rogue donaven laughed not me
buddy your friendll never be deader
go have a look  and as perry
walked over and knelt down beside
spudsy don a ven turned back and
pointed a finger and said you there
-youre old man beard aint you
never mind lyin i know you are
the guy with all the bucks he
laughed but youre gonna pay out
some of them millions soon mister
to me youll buy back a little package
im gonna hold for you

  ann sherwood put her hand to her
mouth hes going to take the
child-

  sure he is rogue dona ven said
evenly sure he is and why not huh
ive had bulls on my tail for the last
week bulls and g-heat and im sick
o it im gettin myself protection
this flood was a break for me it killed
my trail and it led me right into an
insurance policy    sure im takin
that kid see and you can tell the gs
that she gets bumped if a single one
of em makes a pass at me from now
on

  beard groaned  you-you wouldnt
be that low-

  keep your shirt on grandpop
rogue donaven snapped youll get
your innins later on when i get clear r
with the kid you can buy her back   
now send her over here and if yout

 dont i put the slug on her where she
 stands

   perry meanwhile had been examin-
 ing spudsy who was alive and breath-
 ing hard unconscious the camera was
 a wreck so were the negatives the
 speedgun was okay perry lifted it off
 screwed a fresh bulb into the socket
 while the rogue talked spudsys
 wound didnt bleed much but he looked
 sick perry reached in spudsys pocket
 for a handkerchief and found the
 blackjack

   he should have remembered spudsy
 always had carried the blackjack for
 protection when a guy got nasty about
 a picture

   perry slipped the blackjack into his
 right hand and took up the speedgun
 in his left

   he faced rogue donaven not ten
 feet away

  come on donaven growled
 send the little brat over here if i
 go get her myself i slap you silly-
 wait a minute rogue perry said
 rogue donaven had taken a step or
 two forward he halted abruptly and
 faced perry with the leveled gun
 youre askin for it big boy dont
 say i didnt-

   wait a minute perry said quietly

 doth were poised the one with
 the gun the other with the speed-
 gun both men were taut wound up

   perry said slowly you see this
 bulb in this socket

   rogue donavens eyes flicked down
to the bulb perrys eyes watched the
split second when donavens focused
on the photo-flash he pressed the but-
ton eight feet from rogue donavens
face and squarely in his eyes the bulb
flashed brilliantly as perry stepped
aside the revolver crashed and
missed
hell and high water



  perry stepped outside the gun
muzzle swinging the blackjack in his
right hand with everything he had

  rogue donaven couldnt see any-
thing but black bursting circles three
thousand lumens of light against a
wide open iris did that sort of thing
it took the better part of half a minute
for the irises to readjust themselves
too

  perry only needed two seconds the
blackjack crashed across rogue dona-
vens forehead perry felt the bone
give under the impact of the lead
frankfurter donaven pitched forward
on his face without a sound and laid
still

  no pictures spudsy gill whis-
pered damn it-he-he broke-that
camera-no pictures-of a scene-like
that-

  spudsy perry exclaimed

  i-i feel pretty good said
spudsy fluttering his eyes dont
hurt much-and i-i aint weak so
much dont hurt none-to breathe-
so i guess the slug-didnt hit-my
lung    listen duke was-was it
ethical-to fracture that muggs-
skull cause i think you did

  ann sherwood ran from the win-
dow the waters rising she said
im afraid well have to leave-
jonathan beards face was white
but we cant leave he replied with
grim finality look down the crest
is already over our entrance

  duke whispered spudsy i gotta
tell you something

   yes perry said

  i played you dirt no-no ethics
me all over

  dont get you spudsy

  when they dynamited-lost my
nerve-dropped my camera back there
   when we got here i lifted your
camera stole your film-

  you dont know what youre say-
ing spudsy

   sure i do i figured you were a nice
guy but that a scoop in pix was a
scoop i lifted your camera and your
film rogue busted your camera
mine is down in the valley sorry
duke thats-the game-

  listen you sawed-off ape perry
said youre spilling this because
youre afraid youll die but you wont
and when youre well again im going
to give you a going over

  spudsy sighed and i wont blame
you a bit pal

  perry hilton stood up all this
struggling all this risk plodding and
running and rowing through hell and
high water to get a picture-and when
he got there the cupboard was bare

  he went to the equipment case and
opened it spudsy had told the truth
there was no camera inside there
were flash bulbs and the half gross of
sensitized velox printing paper four
inches by five glossy normal

  wait a second perry said half-
aloud

  he stared at the child in jonathan
beards lap the child who still clung
to the  o kodak brownie an idea
hit him he smiled thinly and whis-
pered oh spudsy im going to
show you  im going to show you
what a fotog misses and what a techni-
cian doesnt  

  the great stone house was trem-
bling perry went to the window and
put his arm around ann and said
dont be frightened

  but look she said softly the
walls wont stand that theyre
crumbling below look down

   he did he could see but faintly yet
he saw enough three csw crude oil
cars had been caught in a water trap
under their window and were pound-


argosy

ing their steel tonnage against the side
of the house aided and abetted by the
terrific force of the maelstrom in the
valley their blows struck shivers
through the house

  jonathan beard nodded looking
older and more haggard they
smashed the garage like tinder he
said hollowly and it was made of
granite stone

  perry nodded he turned ann
around whatever happens he said
dont be afraid i think we can live
through this but not in this house in
any case- he suddenly bent down
and kissed her i wanted to do that
later he said but perhaps there
might not be the chance

  she clung to him without speaking

a few seconds later he disengaged
himself and said wait

he went to the child cynthia and
knelt down beside her hello honey
he said youre not afraid are you
no she replied not with my
granddaddy

  look honey he said i take pic-
tures and my camera is broken would
you loan me yours until i get another
one i promise to take good care of it
cynthia thought it over and then
looked at her grandfather id like to
lend it to the man granddaddy

  its quite all right dear said
beard gently of course you must
help mr hilton he is helping you

  she gave perry the old brownie
no film in it of course as he had ex-
pected perry thanked her gravely and
stood up it was dawn now yet the
sky remained dark he asked ann
what time it was and she said six-ten
he took a reading with his weston
meter and found he couldnt get the
light value needle to move that was
good

  now he took out his pen knife and
cut a thin slit in the top of the brownie
at the back he opened the box of sen-
sitized paper praying that it was as
dark as it looked so that the paper
would not fog he loaded the speed-
gun he had salvaged from the camera
wreckage and then set the brownie on
time he sighted jonathan beard and
the child in the reflex view finder
opened the shutter flashed the bulb
after having thrust a four-by-five con-
tact printing paper down in the slit
where film would normally have been
the picture taken he withdrew the
paper and quickly placed it in the black
envelope which came with the paper

  it seemed to work perry thought
he loaded again slipping sensitized
paper into the camera flashing a bulb
this time he shot roguf donaven on
the floor along with spudsy wounded

  you so and so making paper nega-
tives youre scooping me on my own
shooting oh you dog this is tragic
irony if i ever heard the words and
itll work itll work

  how can it work ann cried

  hes making a negative image on
paper instead of a positive spudsy
explained thats what comes of
being ethical and smart instead of just
smart like me   

   the house trembled as the tank cars
walloped the stones and churned them
into powder

  perry said can we have rope mr
beard

  yes he said in the closets
why

  were all roping together perry
said were leaving here i dont think
the house will stand were going to
have a wild ride everybody were
going to have a tank car for a bronco
itll float right side up because of the
weighted bottom
hell and high water



  the trucks

  they must have dropped off long
ago said perry but those tankers
still float upright itll be a matter of
hanging on and hoping we dont hit
anything weve got to do it-

  i cant said beard hopelessly
im an old man

  hell spudsy said i can and im
shot so you can

  perry went for the rope

v

rphat was a wild ride they saw
cheoke valley in all its muddy
horror-filled wreckage filled water-
filled desolation as they shot down the
valley five of them all roped together
astride the top of a floating tank car
roped too to the hand grabs atop the
tankers twin-valved dome and to the
handrailing around the plump body of
the car they were lucky the car they
had been fortunate enough to make
was bigger than the others a sixteen
thousand gallon job which floated high
and was big enough to be a protection
if they hit anything but they didnt
hit anything

  down the valley they bobbed and
tossed that morning and perry took
thirty-eight of the most wonderful
flood pictures that the chicago
chronicle was ever to publish some
he took by the numerous lightning
flashes which shot down the valley
some he took of closer scenes with the
kalart speedgun

  but finally the sky began to lose its
black-leaden hue and really took on
a sooty gray color as it started to
lighten and perry knew that his pic-
ture taking was nearly over

  he had one paper left in the camera
and he sought frantically for some-
thing to shoot and it occurred to him

that he had missed the most dramatic
picture of them all five people a mil-
lionaire a child a woman a wounded
man himself riding a storm-tossed
tank car down a flooded valley toward
the ohio river

  since he took the picture there were
only four in it he could not put him-
self before the camera on a tank car
but he did take it with a flash bulb
and when he saw their faces in the
momentary glare of the bulb he knew
he had taken something priceless

  that was the last paper negative he
could make it stopped raining and in
half an hour a weak sun thrust itself
out through a veil of mist below the
sodden clouds

  at eleven oclock tired from cling-
ing to the battered tank car they all
noticed suddenly that the terrible pitch-
ing and rolling had stopped they
found themselves floating with breath-
less speed in a broad waterway which
looked as though it were a mile across
and might have been at that

  they clung in toward shore through
no fault of their own perry said i
think were in the ohio river we
must have gone clean through the val-
ley and out into the river the way the
army engineers wanted the wabash to
go that means the pressure must have
eased up on burbank

  spudsy groaned and where will
we wind up in new orleans i could
be seasick

  you sound pretty good perry
said

  i cant understand it said spudsy
and me shot

  its only a flesh wound said
perry i looked you over when you
fell the bullet must have lost all its
umph after going through the camera
it hit your breastbone and richocheted
out again youve really got two holes


argosy

in you but they dont mean anything
well get you fixed up soon the slug
never did get in more than an inch
pal said spudsy gulping you
relieve my mind

  at noon the tank car caught in a
whirlpool of floating wreckage was
forced into a river bank and jammed
hard into the mud there it clung
quick perry said ropes off get
ashore before this thing loses its grip
and goes off again

  he untied himself and leaped to the
river bank beard passed him the child
first and he sat her down ann sher-
wood came next then beard helped
spudsy off he finally came himself
two minutes later the car jerked loose
from the mud bank and went riding
off down the river headed for the gulf
of mexico fifteen hundred miles
away   

  they found they were in shawnee-
town a place of a little more than a
thousand inhabitants but the red
cross had made shawneetown a base
for burbank and there were hundreds
of soldiers all over the place all mov-
ing up into the flood area

  they got spudsy to a jammed hos-
pital for treatment and left him there
jonathan beard asked to go to chi-
cago so did ann perry scouted
around and found a lieutenant

  listen he said can i get a plane
for chicago a plane or a train
you can get a train said the lieu-
tenant theres one shooting back to
chicago in twenty minutes the depot
is three blocks over that way brother
you look damp were you caught up-
river

caught isnt the word perry
grinned thanks for the information
whats the latest on burbank
theyre coming out all right said
the lieutenant the engineers flooded

cheoke valley early this morning the
pressure eased on burbank and any-
way the crest of the wabash has
passed they say the water is receding
already up in burbank theyll be
cleaned out by tomorrow cairo is
the town to have a headache now the
crest has gone downstream
thanks perry said

       thursday afternoon two days
later spudsy gill was lying in
a white bed in the shawneetown hos-
pital feeling too darn good to be in
a hospital and complaining about the
service and the looks of his nurses
when there was a knock at his door
and it opened perry hilton and ann
sherwood walked in each carrying a
newspaper

  hello spudsy perry waved
how do you feel 

  spudsy groaned i feel terrible a
lot you care going off and leaving me
marooned in this one-horse town  
his eyes gleamed what you got
perry handed over a copy of the
chicago chronicle spudsy stared at
the headlines saw the story by ann
sherwood exclusive to the chronicle
and the new york planet he opened
it up saw the flood pictures the paper
negatives had worked perfectly not
only that but the very texture of the
paper had imparted to the positives
made therefrom a canvas-like grain
which made the fotos look almost like
paintings

  gorsh spudsy breathed perry
-you got something there- he
peered through them muttering
finally he came to the one which the
chronicle had printed in eight by ten
inches the last picture the four on
the tank car spudsy sighed that
he said is a gem i suppose its ex-
clusively the chronicles
hell and high water



  yes

  youre a sap you could have made
a grand or more out of the sale and
resale of that particular shot

  that wouldnt have been ethical
perry said

  spudsy groaned ethics again and
when you get all through with ethics
whatve you got fifty bucks a week

  more than that sometimes said
perry show him ann

  ann sherwood went over to the bed
i came down to say goodby spudsy
im flying back to new york tomor-
row so is perry the planet has of-
fered him a better job you see we
split i wrote the story for both papers
and perry gave the pictures to both
it worked out fine but perry thought
of you here

  	she handed him a newspaper
spudsy opened it saw it was the
clarion the most blatant tabloid in the

entire fourth estate and the clarion
believe it or not had flood pictures
six of them and all darn good spudsy
stared duke he whispered you-

  i told your managing editor youd
been hurt and youd sent those shots
up with me he was pleased to get
them hes going to give you a
bonus  

  spudsy was flabbergasted after a
while he said all right perry so
ive been a heel just the same you
were a sap to hand my rag pictures
like these-

  uh-uh ann cautioned smiling at
him

  aw nuts spudsy said all
right he braced himself as if he were
about to undergo a thing of great pain
he closed his eyes clenched his fists
gritted his teeth

  how he asked plaintively does
a guy go about getting ethical

pigeon eggs from oysters

tn the early sixteenth century when cortez in a home-made galleon
anchored in the gulf of lower california the inhabitants of those hot
desolate shores were pearl divers it was in fact some of their pearls that gave
impetus to the exploration of the california coast it is quite probable that
those pearls-big as pigeon eggs-found in the indian tomb opened at
monte alban in  were taken from the same waters and were like those
that cortez took with him when he sailed back to mexico

  today descendants of those divers who fled at the approach of cortez are
still carrying on at the same old stand and in the same old way most of them
are skin divers descending to the lair of the wily oyster unprotected by a
diving suit armed only with a knife some fall prey to the man-eating sharks
that roam those waters and others succumb to paralysis but offsetting these
risks is the possibility of sudden wealth for no diver knows what nacreous
plum may lie cancerous within the viscera of the next oyster

trouble is brewing in the big falcon
motor car plant at industrial city
the falcon company turns out the finest
car in america-and falcon himself is as
solid and honest as the machine that has
been his lifes work until the depression
falcons workers were the most contented
and decently treated in the whole industry
but an efficiency expert was brought to
the plant when the dollars started pinch-
ing an iron-willed martinet j d vick
instituted the speed-up cut salaries drove
the men at top speed and fired them when
they fell behind with the bad feeling
growing among the men labor-racketeers
saw their chance

  they formed a crooked union talked
the malcontents into joining and one way
or another dragged the rest of the men
into line until they could boast a hundred
percent membership now the union con-
trols the plant as some of the older
wiser workers realize a crooked union
from the outside looks much the same
as an honest one and even if falcon
should one day realize the sort of organi-
zation that is burning the heart out of his

plant hed be pretty helpless to combat it

  any move he made to disband the union
and encourage the formation of an honest
one would result in the leaders calling a
strike their control of the plant is un-
challenged   

   his is the situation when duncan
mccann arrives in industrial city to
seek employment at the falcon works and
theres a story behind that too a story
of misunderstanding between father and
son  a story of two prides in conflict

  involved in a hit-and-run smash-up that
threatens to become a front-page sensa-
tion duncan mccann had come to the
long-threatened parting of the ways with
his father for to james mccann the gov-
ernor of the state his son was a no-good
wastrel who was constantly compromising
the integrity of the mccann name and po-
sition and to young duncan his father
was a stiff-necked tyrant who refused to

understand duncans ambition to become
a mechanical engineer and who offered
him a mausoleum instead of a home to live
in he was glad when the break finally
came

  so duncan mccann changed his name
to john duncan and started out for in-
dustrial city

on the way he encounters two girls
both of them destined to play a part
in his new and suddenly altered existence
the first is marcia dubois who seems to
know a good deal about strikes and who
after begging duncan not to try to get
work at the falcon plant tricks him into
missing the bus both of them are riding on

  the other is a pert-nosed smartly
dressed young woman who gives duncan a
lift who lectures him about capital and
labor and the new freedom and whose en-
thusiasm for the cause she preaches is
matched only by her misconception of the
whole situation dropping duncan at the
gates of the plant she promises to put him
in touch with people who will enlighten his
ignorance she tells him her name it is
helen falcon

  duncan manages to get work as a day
laborer in the plant and almost immedi-
ately encounters the tyranny of the union
organizers an irishman named omalley
with a red-headed temper to match his fiery
hair refuses to join the union he has
worked in plants all over the country and
he knows an honest union when he sees
one he also can recognize on sight a
bunch of racketeers and extortionists dis-
guised as union bosses john robb the
union leader gives omalley three hours
to think it over

  late in the afternoon there is a sudden
outcry of accident and duncan is told
that omalley has been killed-six inches
of hand-drill steel have gone into his
stomach

  when robb approaches duncan only
mack saddler duncans new-found friend
can keep him from flying at robbs throat

  omalley called you a rat duncan
blazes out but that isnt strong enough
for you murderer is what you are and ill

see you swing before i put my name on
your list

   robb only smiles a little better be
careful sonny you might get what omal-
ley got  

chapter v

mike finn

mccanns lean body jerked
taut anger beat in his
temples grew until robbs
broad face was the only thing left in
the world until his shoulders ached
with the desire to drive his fist full into
those grinning lips he leaned forward
his hands jerking up and said flatly
try it guy and youll be starting a
union on the under side of a tomb-
stone you want to be sure you dont
miss not any or-

  steel fingers dug into mccanns
shoulder and mack saddlers even
voice pierced his rage steady lad
youll accomplish nothing this way
the job-setterll have you drawing
your check if he sees you

  thanks mccann jerked away
finished ramming the body bolts into
place he stepped back and saddler
squeezed past him into the car

  mccann shot a glance at robb as
they bent over the chassis that was
moving into position under the body
drop the squat mans face was dark
but the leering smile clung to his lips
as though frozen there ugly lights
showd in his muddy eyes as they
flicked over mccanns face then he
was staring up

   the electric crane crawled into posi-
tion over the square hole in the floor
above a sedan body swayed below the
crane robb waved it down the hoist
man dropped it smoothly until it
swung only an inch or so above the
four guide punches set in each corner
of the chassis


argosy

  the rest was simple mccann had
already done it many times in his short
day on the assembly line he and robb
swung the body gently until the corner
holes in the floor of the body were
exactly above the four punches robb
would signal then and the crane man
would drop the body that remaining
foot the punches would guide it into
place assured perfect matching of the
bolt holes drilled in the body and
chassis

  they did that now mccanns gloved
hands were flat against the side of the
car holding it steady when robb
yelled

  hey fix that punch

  mccanns eyes jerked around saw
robbs pointing hand saw that the
front punch on his side of the car was
leaning at a sharp angle he dropped
to one knee and jerked the punch
squarely upright at that precise second
the body came down

  a flicker of unexpected movement
was mccanns only warning he
dropped suddenly whipped his hand
away from the punch something
brushed his fingertips and steel jarred
against steel then mccann was star-
ing at his bare hand-at his glove
which was pinned between the body
and chassis if hed been a fraction of
a second slower his fingers would have
been sheared off as cleanly as though a
giant ax had sliced through them

  he was on his knees when feet
scuffed the floor beside him and
robbs harsh voice asked you hurt
jack i thought-

  mccann tipped his head up no
you werent fast enough i had time
to- his voice trailed away as the
sharp-faced foreman elbowed close to
shout

  whats wrong why aint you
guys on your job

  duncan got his glove caught when
the body come down robb explained
i was afraid he lost a couple of fin-
gers his hand came up hes new
here so i was doin the signalin but
the crane guy cant see me so good an
he let her down

  the foreman nodded at mccann
you do th signalin from now on
an watch what youre doin we had
enough accidents around here for one
day

  mccann choked down angry words
robb slapped his shoulder and said
hell be all right soons he gets wise
then the squat man spun crossed the
assembly line and seconds later was
leaning inside the car dropping bolts
in place

qphe foreman left and mccann
went back to work what had hap-
pened had been no accident robb had
deliberately intended to catch his hand
he was sure of that but robb had cov-
ered himself neatly and there was no
proof mccanns brow furrowed he
couldnt prove it was anything but an
accident the thing had happened too
fast robbs dropping hand had been
all that was necessary just a gesture
easily mistaken easily denied

  nor could he prove that the drill
that had torn omalleys insides to
jelly had not slipped by accident he
knew it every man in the plant knew
it and yet  it was murder-perfect
murder-occurring in the sight of a
hundred men

   mccanns teeth vised little ridges of
muscle stood out along the clean line
of his jaw something had to be done
but what-and how

  the remaining hours of the after-
noon brought no answer when the
line stopped robb waited only long
enough to say that was close guy
strike



  you want to watch your mitts before
 he swung away toward the ramp

   mack saddlers eyes were thought-
ful his voice low you shouldnt have
done that lad hes a bad enemy that
one hes tricky and smooth and dead-
ly youd best change your mind about
joining the union its the safest thing
to do

   mccann swore and his eyes found
saddlers face i ought to-

   it can wait lad kim saddlers
lips were close to mccanns ear wait
till were away from the plant before
you talk

  mccann shrugged lapsed into
silence nor did the brothers speak
until they were outside the plant gate
then it was kim saddler who asked
wherere you living lad

   place called the arlington hotel
 kim nodded you can ride with us
 we go past there our cars in the park-
 ing lot down the street

   mccann hesitated and then fell in
step with the brothers he was bone-
tired every muscle of his legs ached
in separate protest at each step his
shoulders throbbed and the palms of
his hands were raw and blistered all
the springiness had gone out of his
stride

   they had covered a full block when
the sight of a white hat in a parked car
brought mccanns head up there was
something about that pert turban
something about the half-glimpsed pro-
file and dark hair that struck a familiar
chord his lips thinned as they drew
abreast of the big sedan the girl in it
was marcia dubois

   she was alone in the car and she
didnt see mccann approach she
didnt move till he put one hand on
the door and said hello miss du-
bois

  she looked up then her eyes widen-

 ing in surprise faint color darkened
 her cheeks her lips moved but no
 sound came from them

   mccanns voice was cold youre
still very beautiful beautiful enough to
get away with murder this cars
pretty flashy for a giri who has to ride
around the country is busses did you
send the owner after cigarettes too
she said please-

   tell me he went on what it was
that i did or said why did you make
me miss that bus why did you want
me stranded in the mountains over-
night 

   im sorry i did that she tried to
smile but didnt quite succeed i had a
reason of course but now it doesnt
seem like a very good one i cant tell
you what it was and id rather you
didnt ask but-she fumbled in her
purse-you must let me pay for your
bus ticket

   mccann shook his head a service
station attendant got me a ride in it
didnt cost me anything but my time
i was lucky

   you- she looked up at him and
then pulled her eyes away youre
working at the falcon plant 

   yes

   she didnt speak right away and in
the moment of silence mccann studied
the side of her face he could see only
the long drooping lashes the curve of
her cheek and the corner of her mouth

  she spoke rapidly then without
looking up spoke in a low murmur-
ing voice that mccann had to strain to
hear i will tell you this much i tried
to warn you i really did dont work
in the falcon plant quit you can get
a job somewhere else and even if you
couldnt it would be- she stopped
then her slim hands lax in her lap
maybe wed better forget the whole
thing just act as if i hadnt said any-


argosy

thing she looked up and the bright-
ness had gone out of her eyes her
voice was cool distant its been nice
seeing you perhaps ill run into you
again goodbye

  but why-

  goodbye

tte was still standing on the walk
when the big man brushed past
him to open the car door he said
you drive marcia and dropped into
the seat as the girl slipped under the
wrheel

  mccann eyed him narrowly he was
big with a hard sure bigness that ex-
tended to his long-fingered hands to
his massive well-shaped head his
clothes were expensive but in perfect
taste his close-cropped hair was red
and when he turned mccann could see
the tiny crescent-shaped scar across
the bridge of his nose

  he grinned up at mccann as marcia
jockeyed the car away from the curb
hey jack all done for today
yes mccann said shortly
nothing left now but a hot dinner
and a bath huh  the big mans voice
was pleasant and deep there was
laughter in his eyes laughter and
something else    something very like
the glitter of gun steel under light

  the big sedan was gone then slip-
ping smoothly out into the traffic
stream mccann wheeled continued
down the block kim saddler hailed
him and he saw the small sedan
double-parked only a few feet away

  friends of yours kim inquired
as mccann climbed into the car

  mccann said no and then real-
ized that both brothers were watching
him he saw that there was an odd
strained look around their mouths

  youre sure it was kims bitter
drawd

  of course ive seen the woman be-
fore i met her on the bus a week ago
but shes not what youd call a friend
of mine he told them what had hap-
pened

  a questioning look passed between
the brothers and then mack asked soft-
ly you wouldnt know who her
friend was the big red-headed man

  no i wouldnt mccanns temper
flared and while this third degree is
going on you might tell me just
what-

  kims mouth pulled down but
macks voice carried the same easy
tone gently lad gently if you didnt
know who you were talking to theres
nothing to get worked up about does
the name mike finn mean anything to
you 

  no

   saddler started the car swung it out
into the traffic it will lad mike finn
is the union boss he is the union he
holds it together with his two big hands
and without him thered be no union-
at least no crooked union now do you
see why we wondered 

  of course mccann leaned for-
ward

  the woman is his secretary

  mccann fell silent marcia dubois
the union boss secretary for a mo-
ment thought held him silent

  he looked up then to find kim
watching him deep lines framed the
tall mans mouth youve had a plenty
busy day little man he said writh a
wry grin robbs a bad man to have
for an enemy youve declared yourself
on the wrong side of the fence you
cant do anything alone id hate-
his eyes became bleak id hate to see
you go out of the plant on a stretcher
and you will lad there are too many
ways they can get you not right away
they wont try anything so soon after
strike



the last-accident he spat the last
word out as though it had a bitter taste
but sooner or later youll get it-just
like omalley

  what good would it do if i joined
the union

  kim saddler looked away none
maybe this union aint the big national
kind not by a long pull there isnt
one man in ten who joined because he
wanted to join but every man in the
plant would jump at the chance to join
an honest union

  then-

  most of us joined because we had
to and because we knew we could do
more good on the inside than on the
out there might be a chance to blast
finns machine wide open there might
be a chance to get an honest union
here-

  kim mack saddler cut in you
talk too much let the lad alone

  kim shrugged youve got the pic-
ture anyway he told mccann and
the rest of it is up to you

  right mccanns voice was even
i think i might take your advice but
even if i dont saddler i didnt hear

a word vou said
t

  a slow grin pulled at kims mouth
mack turned to say thanks lad as
he pulled up in front of mccanns
hotel he was smiling too

chapter vi

counterweight

duncan mccann spent many
hours in thought before he slept
that night kims words had been rea-
sonable after all there wasnt any
sense getting himself killed off and
maybe he could do something from the
inside he found that he wanted very
much to help the men at the plant with
a kind of stubborn angry idealism that

surprised him good old mccann blood
coming out in him he guessed wearily
it would be a tough fight

  he knew too what the penalty for
failure would be he could still hear
omalleys scream as six inches of drill
steel ripped through his insides and
omalley had only refused to join the
union they had murdered him quickly
efficiently what would they do to a
man who tried to wreck the union a
new grimness framed mccanns mouth
as he stared into the darkness once
discovered hed be taken care of-
plenty thered be another messy job
for the first-aid crew

  that mccann told himself
would fill even the governors specifi-
cations for making points the hard
way

   he grinned then realizing that as a
union member he would have a chance
to see marcia dubois again he was
still wondering how much that knowl-
edge had affected his decision when he
fell asleep

  the next morning he tucked one of
his remaining ten dollar bills into his
watch pocket before he left for the
plant he found robb already at his
station under the body drop

  here mccann dropped the folded
bill into robbs hand ive changed
my mind as long as the plants a hun-
dred per cent union id better join

  the squat mans muddy eyes showed
no surprise he merely said okay
guy ill write you a receipt at noon

  the work seemed easier that morn-
ing after the stiffness worked out of
mccanns back the line was still run-
ning forty-five cars an hour but mc-
cann had caught the swing of his job
and was able to maintain the swift
pace he even found time to watch
kim saddler the tall man worked
with effortless speed his big hands


argosy

never wasting a motion he put the
strip of insulation upon which the
body rested in place around the chassis
and shellacked it there

  the morning was two hours old
when the foreman touched mccanns
shoulder said this guyll relieve
you

  mccann stepped back wonderingly
as another man took his place the
foreman said youre wanted in the
office and led the way across the
floor

  they went down a single flight of
stairs past a row of lettered doors and
stopped in front of one bearing the
words  d vick efficiency

  in there the foreman said hes
waiting for you

  mccann asked but what-

  the sharp-faced foreman said ask
him pivoted and stalked away

mccann went through the door
into a windowless white walled
office a pale shirt-sleeved young man
danced up from a small desk whats
years

  i understood that i was wanted
down here-

 name

  duncan john duncan

  the youth consulted a sheet of paper
on his desk looked up said go on in
hes waiting

 j d vick didnt move when
mccann came through the door he
was small an egg-bald little man with
jumpy eyes and thin bloodless lips he
nodded toward a straight-backed chair
and built a neat temple of his fingers
while he watched mccann sit down

  i sent for you his voice wras sur-
prisingly deep after id seen your
card according to this youve a col-
lege degree in mechanical engineering
is that right

  mccann said yes

  vick consulted the card in front of
him there are always opportunities
for men with a technical education in
the falcon plant we want trained
men and we make every effort to give
them all possible opportunity for ad-
vancement

  mccann waited

  you understand of course that it
is impossible to offer every technical
graduate a position in our drafting
room but there are other ways other
jobs that offer a substantial salary as
well as a chance to show loyalty to the
company he inspected his finger-tips
needless to say the men who do
prove their loyalty are first in line for
the openings in the laboratory or
draughting room

  go on please mccann said

  vick cleared his throat and leaned
forward you may or may not know
that most of the workmen in this plant
are members of a newly formed union
this union is working against our in-
terests and against the interests of the
men themselves we already pay the
highest wages inthe industry and have
the best working conditions this union
is simply breeding discontent

  mr falcon vick went on has
always had the welfare of his em-
ployees at heart and now he fears that
they are in the grip of an unscrupulous
group of racketeers he wants to cor-
rect that condition

  a quizzical light grew in mccanns
eyes yes

  this position i mentioned is along
that line you will of course have to
continue to work at your present job
and you will have to join the union
and then-then you will attend all the
meetings and whatever other gather-
ings the workmen may have you will
keep an accurate record of all labor
strike



activities and report to me for this
small service you will receive double
your present wage

  wait a minute mccann inter-
rupted are you trying to hire me for
a labor spy

  vick swallowed wet his lips if you
insist upon using the baldest interpreta-
tion you might call it that

  mccann was silent for a moment
this meant there would be other spies
-twenty or thirty of them-scattered
throughout the plant one more
couldnt make any difference and-
a thought ticked through his head it
would be safer faster to work alone

  im sure if you consider it fully
vicks deep voice broke the silence
that you will-

  sorry mccann shook his head
sorry but i cant agree with you a
labor spy is my idea of something
pretty low its a job i wouldnt want
-at any price

  vicks bloodless lips pressed into a
thin line youre sure you wont re-
consider

  positive

  i regret that indeed i regret it
verv much i was sare that a person of
your ability and training would see his
way celar to- his voice died then
and he bent again to inspect the card in
front of him i should i suppose dis-
charge you but i imagine that the em-
ployees already suspect that there are
ah-informers among them so- he
tipped his head back i will have to
transfer you to another department
he scribbled something on a small
card passed it across the desk take
this to douglass youll find him on the
second floor

  mccann tucked the card into his shirt
pocket and stood up he was nearly
to the door when vick spoke again

  if you should-ah-change your

mind you can notify me at any time
the offer will hold good for the bal-
ance of the week

  okay but dont expect it mccann
went out and up the stairs to the sec-
ond floor one of the workmen pointed
douglas out a grav-haired long-faced
man who glanced at the card mccann
handed him and said hmmm well

i	can always use a good man up here
his dark eyes probed mccanns face
heat bother you

  i dont know ive never worked
where it was very hot

  a small grin pulled at douglass lips
you will from now on

tie led the way down a narrow
- - aisle through a large double door
into a room that was heavy with the
smell of fresh paint it was hot here
too with a damp cloying heat that
started the sweat springing from every
pore on mccanns body

  douglas stopped beside a tank that
reared to shoulder height above the
floor youll work here he jerked
a thumb at a man who stood on a wide
metal bench halfway up the side of the
tank hell show you what to do
douglass left and the workmen ges-
tured at a locker against the wall said
get an apron

  mccann obeyed and then came back
to watch a hooded oven-like a tunnel
about six feet wide and eight feet high
-ran the length of the room and then
curved along the wall there was an
opening in the oven beside the metal
bench and the workman was dipping
bundles of parts into the tank of paint
and hanging them on hooks suspended
at intervals below an endless chain in-
side the oven

  mccann climbed up on the bench
the hot breath of the oven licked out
to meet him heavy with paint fumes


argosy

  the workman grinned you can
quit worrying guy it cant get any
worse than this you got the worst job
in the whole plant right now

  mccann worked a smile on his lips
okay whats first

  the workman showed him showed
him how to slosh a fifty-pound bundle
of fender braces back and forth in the
tank how to wait until the endless
chain brought the hook into position
and how to heave that dripping bundle
up over the tank edge finally how to
get it at arms length and hold it there
while his feet slipped on the paint
splashed bench until the moving hook
yanked the load out of his hands

  mccann worked in grim silence a
half dozen times that morning he was
ready to quit and a half dozen times
the memory of his fathers bitter voice
held him there youve never had the
guts to stick to any job

  his gloves were slippery and paint-
sodden by the end of the first ten min-
utes he tried working without them
and burned his hands on the hot metal
of the endless chain the paint dripped
off the apron soaked through his
trouser legs got into his shoes

  and the heat    the fumes that
swept out of that oven door were like
hells own breath sweat trickled off
the point of his chin ran into his eyes

  he was an hour cleaning up that
night before he left the plant later at
the hotel he pushed away from the
table and left his dinner almost un-
touched he was asleep almost before
he could push his aching legs flat
against the sheet

  the next day was a continuation of
the same frenzied inferno always the
grinning giant who shared the bench
with him held to the same killing pace
up down up down the heat seemed
to increase with each passing hour

quitting time found mccann barely
able to climb down off the bench that
night he didnt even try to eat

  two other days mccann spent on
that bench before he looked down to
find douglas standing beside him the
gray-haired man was smiling the as-
sembly line cant get along without
you mccann youre to report back
there for your old job in the morning
the paint-smeared giant laughed
after douglas had gone i was think-
in youd make a good pardner one of
these days these other guys never
last

  mister mccann said heartily i
can understand that

t obbs muddy eyes narrowed for
just a second when mccann
stopped at the body drop the next
morning what are you doin here
he demanded

  i was transferred back here mc-
cann replied

  stool pigeon huh

  mccanns lips flattened his hands
came up doubled he had taken two
steps toward the squat man when a
hand touched his arm and an easy
voice asked whereve you been lad 
mccann spun to find the saddler
brothers standing behind him paint
shop he said tersely

  kims eyes hardened and his voice
was raw paint shop huh its funny
but they only transfer one kind of guy
out of the paint shop

  youre wrong mack saddler cut
in the lads no spy

  maybe not kim drawled but itll
take a lot to convince the other men
mack saddler drew mccann aside
theres a meeting tonight lad howd
you like to go down there with us  you
could come out to the house for supper
and well all ride together

 a-
strike



  this wont get you in bad

  mack shook his head it couldnt
not any more than we already are

  thanks ill be glad to come

  work under the body drop seemed
easy after the blistering blasts of the
paint shop not once during the morn-
ing hours did robb speak to him and
not once was it necessary for mccann
to leave his task unfinished

  at noon he ate with the saddler
brothers at the long table against the
wall he had finished before he realized
that they were alone at the big table-
though every other table in the room
was crowded coventry   

  kim saw his puzzled look one
thing about eating with you he
drawled its a cinch to get elbow
room

  mack said lay off kim it isnt
his fault they think hes a spy

  no and it wasnt omalleys fault
he didnt like the union kims voice
was loud raw but he couldnt be any
deader

  the voices at the tables around them
died abruptly there was only a shuf-
fling rustling murmur as the men
twisted to face them the silence thick-
ened grew spreading like a wave
across the room it held thick and taut
until robbs bull voice rang out

  we gotta clean these damn spotters
out we gotta be sure theres no stool
pigeons sittin in on the meetings

  macks husky whisper brought mc-
canns head around the tall mans
face was suddenly strangely old

  kim he said kim you-you
fool

  kims mouth was a hard line he
made a disdainful noise with his flat
lips-a little explosion of disgust and
stiff-necked defiance

  mccann had a chance to speak to
mack as they filed past the time clock

  a-

maybe wed better call the dinner off
ive caused you enough trouble-

  afraid the tall man asked

   it isnt that but-

  then we wont change it

  low-voiced comment followed them
across the floor to the body drop
heads averted quickly as they ap-
proached and tight voices buzzed in
their wake saddlers expression never
changed

  mccann watched robb narrowly all
afternoon but the squat man was un-
usually good-humored once or twice
he grinned thickly at mccann but he
didnt speak

  quitting time found mccann still
puzzled still wondering the thunder-
ous clamor of the line had died away
and he was racking his tools when
kims harsh duck lad burst in his
ears

  mccann crouched then threw up his
arms an end-wrench clanged viciously
against the post beside him spun away
mccann whirled fifty pairs of eves
met his stare there were a hundred
men within easy throwing distance and
any one of them might have hurled the
wrench

  mccann turned to kim did vou

see-
it

   not a thing lad forget it

tvtark and kim saddler waited
outside mccanns hotel while he
shaved and got into a dark suit kim
looked at him sharply when he got into
the car but didnt speak during the
rest of the ride kim was slouched far
down on the seat his chin on his chest
staring moodily in front of him

  once mccann tried to start a con-
versation but drew only monosyllabic
answers kim didnt speak until after
mack had stopped in front of a low
frame house


argosy

  listen duncan you say youre not
a spy thats okay with us we believe
you he laughed harshly maybe
were suckers but thats the way were
made anyway even a spy wouldnt be
dumb enough to do what youre do-
ing

  mccann only stared

  dont go into the hall in those
clothes that suit is tailor made and it
cost two hundred if it cost a dime
same with the overcoat one look at
those duds and youll never be able to
make the other guys believe you arent
on two payrolls

  mack said ill lend him a jacket
and he can leave his clothes in the car
he raced the motor well be back for
you at a quarter to eight kim

  mrs mack saddler was a full-
checked smiling woman who made
mccann feel at home from the moment
she met them at the door

  youll be john duncan she
greeted him and wouldnt you think
after all these years a husband would
know enough to warn the cook when
he was bringing company for supper
then she was taking his hat and coat
while mack laughed thats a woman
even a weeks notice isnt enough
shes been plannin on this mind you
for two days and if you dont praise
her pie shell hate you forever

  it was a friendly house more than
that it was a warm wholesome home
that had known much living the rugs
and furniture were old and worn but
spotless a well filled bookcase stood
against one wall of the living room
and there was a stack of magazines on
the center table that had seen much
reading

  they ate in a white-walled kitchen
off shining oilcloth mrs saddler kept
his coffee cup full and tried twice to
make him eat a third slice of apple pie

mack saddler stuffed his pipe and
smoked thoughtfully for some minutes
before he said wed best be moving
lad he turned to his wife if youll
hunt up that old leather jacket of mine
ann

  she hesitated for just a moment be-
fore she left the table and mccann
could have sworn that it was fear that
looked out of her eyes clouded her
voice

  you - youll be home earlv
mack

  right after the meeting

  she brought the jacket and accom-
panied them to the door well be
seeing a lot of you she told mccann
i know mack will want you to come
back often

  five minutes later mack ran the car
into the driveway beside his brother
kims house and sounded the horn he
was bending forward to shut off the
motor when a slender figure slipped
away from the deep shadow of the
garage and ran to the side of the car

  mack mack    it was a
womans rushing breathless voice
hes-hes drinking again and hes
fretting about the union ive tried to
persuade him to stay home but he
wont listen

  she was leaning against the car door
then her hand on macks arm the
glow of the dashlight showed her finely
cut features-her twitching mouth her
frantic eyes

  dont worry elsie mack said
evenly well take care of him

  but he might lose his temper mack
he might hes so upset he might do
anything i couldnt stand it if he
should be    her voice dropped
hes all i have mack he might for-
get me and the kids for a minute but
hed be sorry when it was too late its
his temper mack youll have to watch
strike



him she made a little moaning cry
her hand leaped to cover her mouth
what would we do if they killed
him

   steady elsie youre being foolish
now nothings going to happen to
kim mack patted her shoulder clum-
sily well take care of him hell be
home in a couple of hours

   youre-youre sure

   i promise

   the woman raised her head her im-
ploring eyes clung to mccanns face
you will you help watch him

   of course

   there was a step on the concrete be-
hind them and the woman whirled
melted back into the darkness the
grinding whir of the starter drowned
the sound of her footsteps kim sad-
dler heaved himself into the back seat
said lets go his lean face was
dark and a somber bitterness smol-
dered in his eyes

   mack backed the car out into the
street

chapter vii

strike meeting

union headquarters occupied a
ramshackle building on the edge
of the factory district the auditorium
had once been a theater and the floor
sloped sharply to the flag-draped stage
a wide balcony ran around three walls
of the big room

   the hall was already crowded when
mack led the way to a bench against
the back wall under the balcony tight
groups gathered in a dozen places on
the floor harsh voices blurred over-
lapped beat ceaselessly at their ears
trailing plumes of tobacco smoke
drifted under the hot lights

   every seat in the hall was filled long
before the meeting was called to order

a thin dark man in a rumpled suit
acted as presiding officer mack whis-
pered a terse explanation hes the
president the men elected him finns
the acting secretary

   mccanns restless eyes searched the
room for the big red-headed man he
wasnt among those on the platform
nor was he anywhere in the crowd

   a reedy-voiced secretary read a list
of names of new members mccanns
name was among them someone from
the floor made a motion that flowers
be sent to three sick members and it
was passed by a hearty chorus of ayes

   an uneasy tension gripped the hall
then the sharp clatter of voices in-
terrupted the presidents toneless drone
and the speaker who followed him got
even less attention

   hes here 

  the voice came from high in the
balcony and was instantly taken up by
a hundred other throats a splatter of
applause ran through the crowd as
mike finn led a tight group of men
through the side door a smiling giant
his red head towered above those
around him

   he paused in the center of the room
held up his hand for quiet his rich
deep voice reached every corner

   theres news for you tonight men
good news

   someone cheered and the thunder-
ous pound of stamping feet rose above
the calls of speech speech

   finns white teeth shone in laughter
save the cheers he shouted time
enough for that later he swung
stalked down the aisle to the platform
the group that had come with him
broke up scattered among the crowd
two of them found seats on the
benches just ahead of mccann one of
them was slim and small no bigger
than a boy his full-cheeked face was


argosy

smooth except for the two deep harsh
lines that fjracketed his mouth a
bottle-neck protruded from his coat
pocket and when he spoke to the man
beside him his speech was thick
blurred

  the other was almost as big as finn
himself his high cheek-boned face
was flat scarred and his brows were
only pale glints above lidded eyes

  mike finn had crossed the stage
turned to face the crowd kim saddler
leaned close to mccann as waves of
sound swept over the floor they
work for finn he whispered the
big guy is montana fells hes finns
bodyguard and number-one gunman
the other ones ryan

  mccann nodded and turned his eyes
toward the platform finn had begun
to speak and the crowd grew still 
six months ago he said i talked
to forty or fifty of you from this plat-
form i promised you certain things if
you would help me form an organiza-
tion you did that and tonight i can
tell you that the things i promised are
within reach

  i promised you higher wages i
promised you better working condi-
tions i promised you a share in the
profits and a closed shop

  finn paused then allowing the ex-
pectant tension to build up before he
went on and tonight i can tell you
that those things are within our
reach

  a salvo of cheers rocked the hall

  we can get those things finn
roared and we will why should the
general manager of the falcon plants
draw a hundred and fifty thousand dol-
lars a year in salary alone why should
he receive a bonus of seventy-five thou-
sand dollars

  a bull voice from the balcony roared
yah an he wouldnt know an end-

wrench from a paint brush laughter
and cheers swept over fhe floor the
rumble of stamping feet choked the
room with sound

t he short man in front of mccann

was tugging at the flask in his

pocket i knew it mccann heard
him say i knew thatd put em in the

aisles

  the big man twisted his head
growled shut up ryan

  no man can earn that much finn
was speaking again that money
should go to the workmen who build 
the falcon cars the silence came
bck to the big room and the union
is in a position to demand that the
profits be split up among the workmen
our membership in the falcon plant is
a hundred per cent they have to listen
to us now or well shut their plant up
tighter than a drum if they dont meet
our terms they cant turn a wheel

  heres the program tomorrow
morning falcon will get a list of our
demands union recognition a boost
in wages shorter hours if he doesnt
meet those demands well close his
plant we want union recognition and
well get it your jobs will be safe
then they wont be able to fire any
man without-

  a low-voiced murmur ran through
the crowd strike a half hundred
voices caught the word repeated it
until it echoed from every corner of
the room strike the muttering
died but the air was electric

  wait finns head was thrown
back his hands held up for silence
dont get the wrong idea we dont
want a strike-except as a last resort-
and there isnt one chance in a hundred
that well have to strike but weve
got to be prepared weve got to build
up the strike fund
strike



  kims long fingers dug deeply in mc-
canns arm

  mr president finn was address-
ing the thin man at the speakers table
i move that a special assessment of
ten dollars be levied on each member
this to be effective at once the money
to be added to the general strike fund
the thin man was getting out of
his chair when big-shouldered mon-
tana fells bellowed i second that
finn was smiling when he faced the
crowd the motions before the house
and all in favor may signify by the
usual method

  the electric mutter ran through the
crowd again then faintly someone
high in the balcony said aye other
voices came in and the chorus grew to
a mighty roar

  finn smiled and nodded as the noise
abated mccanns head jerked around
as sudden movement exploded beside
him

  kim saddler was on his feet he
said let go curse you and shook
his brothers hand off his arm then he
faced the platform and shouted

  wheres the rest of our money
why dont you tell us that before you
bleed us for more

  awed silence hit the smoky room
silence that stretched thin before finn
said will you repeat that question
please

  you can be darned sure i will
kims lean face was paper-white his
hands were knotted into fists at his
sides i want to know whats happened
to the rest of our money the unions
had two thousand members for the last
four months the dues are three dol-
lars a month what happened to that
twenty-four thousand dollars why
cant that go in the strike fund 
someone yelled throw him out
other voices joined the clamor and

then finn was shouting for silence

  this hall costs you fifty or a hun-
dred a month kims harsh voice rang
out and once or twice weve had free
beer and this is the third special as-
sessment who gets the rest of the
money you the general manager
of the falcon plant is a piker along-
side of you

  finns expression didnt change
you can come to my office at any time
and the books will be opened for your
inspection

  mack was pulling at kims arm say-
ing sit down you fool sit down
while you can still-

  again finn had to wait for quiet
before he spoke i can do this i can
bring a statement to the next meeting
showing where every penny of the
money was spent and why those ex-
penses were necessary

  kim saddler twisted away from
macks grip tried to speak but a storm
of protest blotted out his words

  quiet quiet finns great voice
brought a semblance of order again
he has a right to question me any of
you have this is your union im just
one of the officers ill be glad to an-
swer any question

  all right kim saddler roared
tell us what part murder has in union
activity tell us why you had omalley
killed tell us why-

nphe quiet lasted for just a clock
tick and then exploded into roar-
ing chaos all over the hall men were
coming to their feet yelling mccann
got a glimpse of kims face as he
twisted off the bench it was white set
and he was staring straight ahead with
the startled eyes of a sleep-walker who
has been suddenly awakened

  then montana fells was lurching
toward kim his big hands leaping for


argosy

the tall mans throat ryan was beside
montana his lips tight across his teeth
the bottle still clutched in his hand

  mack shouted this way kim
theres a door-

  but montana fells had kim before
he could move-had his thick-fingered
hands locked around his throat was
pushing his head back kim rained
blows on the big mans face but he
didnt seem to notice an unholy light
flamed in his eyes and the cords in his
neck stood out his terrible grip never
lessened kims blows were weaker and
his legs wilted suddenly

  mccann pushed forward slammed
into ryan who turned open-mouthed
mccann swept the bottle out of his
hand swung it in a savage arc at a spot
just above montanas ear broken glass
and whisky sprayed over the big man
he stood for just a second unmoving
and then fell like a dropped coat

  mack stooped got his hands under
kims arms mccann bent to help the
angry mutter grew to full-throated
roar kim was on his feet swaying
toward the aisle that was blocked by a
solid wall of bodies mccann was
swinging to follow when a shoulder
bumped his and a low cool voice said
the gun fella youll never get
out without it montanas gun its
under his arm

  mccann dropped to one knee
fumbled under the big mans coat he
looked up as his fingers found gun
metal ryan was standing behind him
his head was bent his hands thrust
deep in his pockets

take that guy out of town take
him clear to the coast an dont
slop on the way

  mccann came to his feet lunged to-
ward the saddler brothers

  look out a fat man squawked

hes got a gun he pressed back
away from the aisle others took one
look at mccanns face and the black
automatic in his hand and they too
jammed away from the aisle a lane
to the rear door opened as if by magic
mccann could hear finns big voice
above the roar of the crowd as he fol-
lowed the saddler brothers through the
door he turned to look back the lane
was still open and at the far end of
that lane ryan was starting after him
frail short his eyes were shadowed
by a down-turned hat brim his face
might have been a boys face save for
the two deep harsh lines that bracketed
his mouth

rphen the cool night wind was in
their faces as they hurried through
the dark streets to the car mccann
stayed a little distance behind the
others watching the lighted square that
was the union hall door for any sign
of pursuit there was none

  saddler whipped the car over the
fifth street ramp then west on rose-
more ten minutes later he parked in
front of a dine-and-dance place and
said ill be right back he slipped out
of the car when he returned he was
stripping the foil off the neck of a pint
bottle he thrust it into his brothers
hands said here kim you need a
drink

  the tall man shuddered said
thanks in a flat dead voice and
reached for the flask he drank and
then turned to mccann lad you got
me out of a bad spot

  forget it

  mack said out of that one yes
but this isnt over yet

  why dont you say what youre
thinking kim demanded why
dont you tell me what a crazy fool i
was why dont you ask me why i
strike



didnt keep my mouth shut his voice
broke then rasped on i tried mack
i tried but i had a bellyful of finns
lies and then-

  stop it man thats all behind us
now weve got to think mack got
his pipe out of his pocket loaded it
slowly they wont dare kill you at
least not the way they killed omalley
not when every man in the union heard
you thats the thing thatll stop them
there are too many men in the plant
who didnt want to join the union one
more killing and theyll bolt finn
knows that did you see the way the
grinning devil sensed the pulse of them
tonight- hed not take a chance thatd
wreck his plans itll be a different way
thats certain an automobile accident
or a-

  he couldnt mccann cut in
even finn cant get away with mur-
der

  youre wrong lad hes done it
before and he will do it again

  then why dont you leave the

city

  the tall man turned money lad
it costs money to feed and clothe a
family you didnt meet my two boys
they were at a scout meeting tonight
and theres three small ones in kims
family our homes are here and weve
worked in the falcon plant for years
then-a rawness came into his voice
-the saddlers have never been good
at running

  but theres nothing to hold you
here kim said to mccann youd
be better off if you-

  hes right lad mack said softly
not only do you have to watch finns
killers but the rest of the men as well
they think youre a spy they know
you were in vicks office before you
went to the paint shop and they know
that you were transferred back to the

line they think voure working for

vick

  but-

   cant you see lad that bald-headed
little apes clever you wouldnt work
for him but if he can make the men
think you are working for him he can
cover his real spies

  so thats what hes doing sur-
prise rode mccanns hot words i
cant see a dimes worth of difference
between us were all in bad he
paused thoughtfully then went on
two weeks ago i spent an afternoon
listening to a grand old man tell me
that our family had never known
enough to quit a fight if its all right
with you ill stick

   its foolish lad

  mccann passed the heavy automatic
into the front seat this should take
care of anything they try outside the
factory and-

  and inside the plant kim said
bleakly theyll find me hard to kill
ive spent too many years there

  mack got the car under way again
it will be safer if we stay together as
much as possible well pick you up at
your hotel in the morning lad
mccann didnt answrer he was re-
membering his fathers voice his
words a word i didnt think id
have to use on my son yelloiv and
there was a sudden tightness in his
chest his throat was dry

chapter viii

storm warning

the morning paper carried a head-
line which read wage tilt
announced at falcon
plant mccanns eyes leaped to the
story below

   a wage raise that will affect every man
   employed by the falcon motor company


argosy

   was announced here today the new scale
   which goes into effect at once sets a new
   high for wages in the motor industry and
   is expected to end all labor trouble among
   the falcon employees 

  mccann was carrying the newspaper
when he walked to the corner to wait
for the saddler brothers he grinned
cheerfully as he climbed into the car
asked did you see it this means
the wars over and-

  mack shook his head it means
trouble lad black trouble finn will
have to find another reason now for
calling a strike falcon beat him to the
punch and by raising the wages he
sidestepped the question of union
recognition finn isnt interested in
wages he wants closed shop he wants
it badly enough to force a strike to get
it

  but he cant now mccann inter-
rupted the men got the higher pay
they wanted theyve-

  kim growled the men finn isnt
thinking about the men he wants
recognition wants it because then hed
be a little tin god and falcon would
have to ask his permission to breathe
then-

  watch yourself lad theres bad
trouble brewing

  the other workmen looked away
when the three of them came up the
walk to the plant gate again hostile
eyes and the electric hum of angry
voices followed them past the time
clocks and up the ramp to the assem-
bly line

  there was an ominous pressure in
the big room a real terrible pressure
that stretched mccanns nerves wire-
tight and turned kims face into a
white twitching mask

  nor did that pressure vanish when
the line began to move and the
strident machine-gun clatter of the air-

hammers choked the room with throb-
bing sound it showed in robbs sullen
thinly lidded eyes in the stiff set of
macks shoulders

  kim showed it in other ways too
his flashing hands had lost some of
their deftness they were old hands
now-stumbling groping hands once
the shellac brush slipped from his fin-
gers and a raw curse spilled from his
lips as he stooped to pick it up

  an hour dragged past two the
threat of impending disaster gradually
slipped away from mccanns mind he
had more than enough to do kim was
slow in finishing each time and mc-
cann had to wait until the strip of in-
sulation was in place before he could
start his task and each second counted
when there was only little more than a
minute allotted to each car

  sweat crawled on mccanns back
robb snarled curses from the other
side of the line and twice mccann saw
the sharp-faced foreman hovering in
the background

  mccann spoke to kim as he
shellacked the insulation in place on the
next chassis dont let it get you-
kims sweat-streaked face twisted to
face mccann its not me he panted
its the guy behind me he cant keep
up and he keeps cornin over on me
theyll have to put a relief man in-
the strip was in place kim stepped
back and away

  mccann dropped the punches in
place and signalled the hoist man to
lower the body that hung above them
his face was thoughtful as he rammed
the body bolts home this might have
been planned they might force the
foreman to transfer kim to another
job if he delayed the line to a job
where they could-

   he finished his task stepped back to
let mack saddler crowd past him the
strike



next chassis was crawling into position
under the body drop kim was only
half done

  mccann placed one punch and
stepped back waited kim grooved the
insulating strip in place leaned for-
ward to pick up the brush

  the hoist man was leaning half out
of his cab lowering the sedan body an
inch at a time mccanns eyes flicked
from robbs face to the yellowish fea-
tures and knife-thin lips of the crane
man he froze there staring for just
a clock tick while an uneasy warning
churned in his brain

  he shouted wildly kim watch
out

kims eyes jerked toward him
mccann had a split-second
glimpse of wide frantic eyes of parted
lips and then the sedan body crashed
down mccann heard a scream and
knew suddenly that the hideous sound
came from his own throat for a full
thirty seconds he swayed there unable
to move his eyes clung to the car in
front of him to the sagging figure  

  the dropping body might as well
have been the blade of a guillotine
kim had been trapped his long body
bent over the chassis he wouldnt have
-couldnt have known any pain there
hadnt been time just a frantic shout
-and death catching him crushing
him there

  one of kims hands was close to his
side blood dripped from his finger-
ends to join the spreading redness on
the floor the toes of his shoes left
a wide double mark as the moving
assembly line pulled him down the
floor

  bellowing shouts rang loud above
the clamor of the air hammers the
line stopped and yammering voices re-
placed the noise of the machines

  mccann found himself beside the
car pulling mack saddler away from
the body

  curse you mack roared let go
of me he might be alive he might
be-

  there were other men there then
fifty or a hundred of them swirling
around the body drop eager hands
reattached the hoist cables there was
a grinding whir and the sedan body
was jerked clear

  taut silence exploded into a welter
of horrified murmurs

  mack stared at the pitifully crushed
thing that had been his brother stared
while his hands came up and knotted
into fists then he turned blindly away
his eyes were glazed fixed the white
pain lines around his mouth looked as
though theyd always been there he
pressed his hands against his temples
pushed a single sentence through gray
lips god be good to kim he tried
you know he tried

  mccanns throat was dry he tried
to speak but the words were only a
meaningless blur saddler brushed past
him to drop on a box and bury his face
in his hands

  the white-jacketed first-aid men
were jamming their way into the open
space around the body one of them
dropped the stretcher and looked sud-
denly away his face greenish his
mouth working

  the other man cursed him and
worked swiftly with a gray blanket
a moment later the blanket-swathed
body was being carried through a nar-
row lane in the crowd

  a big man in a rumpled suit was
talking to the sharp-faced foreman he
turned eyes searching the crowd and
then yelled wheres the man who
was acting as signal man here 

  mccann stopped in front of the big


argosy

man i was the signal man he said

  the big mans face was screwed up
in an angry scowl his eyes flamed
under bristling brows you were
huh well howd this happen

  he delayed in his job and had to
stay with the chassis until it came
under the body drop the crane man
dropped the body on him

  did you signal for him to lower
it

  no

  well  the big man swung to face
the foreman come on come on
whats your version  we cant shut the
line forever

  i didnt see it sir i had noticed
that he was behind a couple of times
this morning but not enough to war-
rant a relief man

  robbs squat body edged through the
fringe of the crowd stopped beside
mccann the big man growled and
who are you

  robb sir i work on the other side
of the body drop he and i-he
nodded at mccann-have the same
operation

  did you see the accident

   yes sir

  get it out what happened
saddler the man who was killed
was behind sir robbs voice was
even low he couldnt keep up and
he had to come under the body drop
with each car in order to finish his
job he was there this time and i
guess the kid here thought hed fin-
ished when he waved the body
down-

  what are you saying that this
man signaled

  it was a mistake sir he didnt
look and then when he saw saddler
was still under the body drop he tried
to stop the hoist man but i guess they
got mixed up then and-

  why you- black anger beat in
mccanns head you dirty liar that
crane man dropped the body without
signal unless you waved him down
robbs expression didnt change as
he looked at the big man but his voice
became low hesitant i-i hate to say
it sir but he did signal you can ask
the hoist man

mccanns anger flamed grew
until in all the world there was
only one face-the flat thick-lipped
face of robb robb had done this
robb had killed kim saddler and now
he was sidestepping the blame

  mccanns shoulders hunched and
his gloved hands clenched robbs
startled eyes jerked to mccanns face
and he tried to step back mccann
threw the punch from his hips straight
at robbs sneering mouth with all the
weight and skill of his shoulders glove
leather splatted soddenly on flesh robb
went back his mouth a crimson smear
mccann was lunging after him when
the big voice shouted

  grab him grab him

  hands clawed at mccanns shoul-
ders threw him off-balance a foot
was thrust suddenly between his legs
and he crashed heavily to the floor he
twisted instantly surged up blows
rained in his face a fist smashed his
head back a boot thudded into his ribs

  the dull taste of blood was in his
mouth then he could feel smooth con-
crete under his hands knew that he
had to get up then a dozen hands
were pulling him erect darkness
crowded in on his brain dully he could
hear the big man saying thats right
hold him the policell be here

  a moment later uniform blue
showed in the crowed and the big man
said over here officer arrest this
man for murder
strike



   whats this

  i want this man arrested for
murder

   the words smashed through the fog
burned in mccanns brain murder
didnt the fool know that it was robb
and the crane man  didnt-

   this was just an ugly dream hed
wake in a minute and find   

   but the shining steel that clicked
over his wrists was real and so was
the voice that said i warn you that
anything you say now will be used
against you

chapter xi

intercession

there was no hot light this time
the small office on the second floor
of police headquarters was lighted
only by the shaded glow of a green
desk lamp there wras  violence-
only a uniformed cop in the chair be-
side the door and a soft-voiced gray-
mustached sergeant behind a flat-
topped desk

   mccanns shoulders ached his back
was numb from hours in the straight-
backed chair his throat was raw hed
lost count of the number of times hed
said as he was saying now but i
didnt kill saddler i didnt signal the
hoist man and if he says i did hes
lying robbs behind this robb and
that-

   the sergeants eyes never left mc-
canns face wait a minute fella i
been here a long time and since i been
here theres been a lot of guys sit in
that chair i seen em come in here for
everything from petty larceny to mur-
der tough guys an punks an they
all say the same thing they got an
alibi thats the first thing then they
say were framin em that they aint
guilty not to hear em tell it they all

start out that way but sooner or later
we get the truth

  but i didnt kill saddler

  you were there you were the sig-
nal man and theres a couple of wit-
nesses that saw you tell the crane man
to drop that sedan body

  youre wrong mccann said des-
perately i-i was framed i told you
who did it

  the sergeant grunted disgustedly
okay he swung spoke to the cop
beside the door hey give black a
yell will you this guys goin down-
stairs an meet the wreckin crew hell
give-an it wont be nice

  the cop went out

  see the sergeant planted both
elbows on the scarred desk-top
youre goin to have to talk sooner or
later you might as well get it over
maybe you can get the da to let
you cop a manslaughter plea that
wont get you the chair an he can
clean the case up in a hurry

  mccann didnt answer he was
trapped the frantic realization grew
in his mind as thoroughly trapped as
kim saddler had been when the sedan
body hurtled down to crush him ruth-
lessly perfectly hed have to face the
reporters soon and one of them would
recognize him every paper in the
state would carry banner headlines

governors son faces
murder charge

   thered be pictures pictures of hin
in a cell of his grim-mouthed iron-
backed father behind the desk in the
governors mansion suddenly his
fathers hard unrelenting voice seemed
to ring in his ears

  my son will receive exactly the
same treatment that any other man
facing a similar charge would receive


argosy

should the courts find him guilty there
will be no mercy shown

   the cop came back through the door
and the sergeant wheeled around to
ask well wheres black

   he aint cornin sarge i met the
captain in the hall an he wants the
kid in his office right away they got
everybody an his brother in there old
man falcons there an the chief an
a-

   okay the sergeant settled back
heavily in his chair youre gettin
important now fella the big shots
want to see you he prodded the air
with a stiff thumb on your feet hell
show you where to go

  mccann got up silently and pre-
ceded the big cop out the door and
down the hall

  in here the cop stepped past
mccann to open a door

   mccann was well into the room be-
fore he saw the familiar blocky figure
in the chair beside the window stan-
ley  had the news of his arrest already
got to the state capitol or-

   mccann stiffened as stanleys eyes
raked over his face

rpheir eyes locked held there
was quick tightening around stan-
leys mouth then almost imper-
ceptibly he shook his head he was
looking away carefully stripping the
wrapper from a slender cigar when the
red-faced police captain spoke

   duncan weve uncovered some in-
formation that makes it necessary for
you to-

   better do this right stanley cut
in evenly tell him he has a right to
a lawyer he doesnt have to talk to us
unless he wants to

   yes mr stanley the captains
face twisted into an annoyed scowl he
leaned forward said heavily duncan

you have the right to wait and consult
an attorney before you answer any
questions but these gentlemen would
like to talk to you now

  mccann said thanks ill be glad
to tell them anything i can

   fine a lean dark man left a chair
near the wall and came to the desk
mccann stifled a gasp of surprise he
didnt have to be told who this man
was j n falcons picture was in print
too often the dark eyes the shaggy
brows and the jutting crag of a nose
were unmistakable j n falcon head
of the falcon automobile company

  falcon put one hand on the desk
this gentleman and i his flat ges-
ture indicated stanleys bulk have
been investigating this accident since
the time the report of your arrest
reached my office were here because
were convinced of your innocence
thank you sir i-

  we checked back falcon went on
and found that the hoist man had
vanished the police have found no
trace of him so far it might have been
possible for you and the hoist man
to have planned this but im inclined
to doubt it the hoist man was trans-
ferred this morning from a different
part of the plant you would have had
no way of knowing that he would be
and no way of arranging this so
quickly he waited a moment and
then added wed like to hear your
story

  surely words crowded mccanns
tongue this was the chance hed been
waiting for this-

  and then he knew that he could say
none of those words the union could
still reach mack saddler could still kill
him as ruthlessly as theyd killed his
brother any accusation he made would
sign macks death warrant besides he
had no proof he knew-every man
strike



in the plant knew-but that wasnt evi-
dence that would stand in court

  well falcon was leaning for-
ward waiting

   just a second stanley got to his
feet maybe id better tell him whom
i represent im investigating the
rumors of labor trouble for governor
mccann

   mccann wet his lips swallowed
stanley went on before he could
speak his narrowed eyes an icy gray
what we want to know is this was
this accident the result of trouble with
this new union

  no mccann said quietly as far
as i know it wasnt

  youre sure

  yes

   then falcon said the only thing
that remains is that the hoist man got
mixed up in his signals and dropped
the sedan body at the wrong time he
kept quiet fearing arrest then ran
but mr falcon the captain
asked how about this wouldnt it
have been possible for duncan here to
have signaled the hoist man to drop
that-

  no falcon turned away from the
desk if you had taken the trouble
to send one of your men up into that
crane cab you would have known bet-
ter the operator can not help but see
the chassis and the men around it if
he can see the hand signals his voice
was tired thin your job will be wait-
ing for you lad ive never yet fired an
employee of mine for something he
didnt do

  mccann said thanks and
watched the door close behind falcons
gaunt figure

there was a moment of silence
after falcon had gone and then
the captain shrugged saying that

puts you in the clear guy if falcon
dont want you we dont

  stanley spoke then his voice a soft
purr id like a chance to talk to dun-
can before he leaves if youve got an
office i could use  

  sure the captain got to his feet
use this one im overdue at home
now anyway ill clear duncan at the
desk he can leave whenever youre
through with him

  the captain left and stanley
grinned at mccann i was afraid you
wouldnt get the idea duncan he
dropped in a chair sit down ive a
couple of questions to ask

  mccann waited silently davork
and i are investigating labor conditions
for your father youve been working
in the falcon plant maybe you can
help

  i know a little about it

  swell davork and i arent getting
along any too well hes been your
fathers secretary too long he insists
on working alone

  i know mccann said bleakly
davorks like that ill tell you what
i know if youll give me your word
not to tell the governor that im here
stanley nodded slowly i thought
it might be like that

  okay this unions big bigger than
anything ive ever seen theyve got
a hundred per cent membership in the
falcon plant swiftly mccann
sketched in details of the method of
organization stanleys cigar went out
in his hand as the big man hunched
forward listened intently

  theyve killed two men that i know
of mccann finished and it looks
like theyre going to get away with it
stanley whistled this is big

  too big to operate without protec-
tion of some kind theres someone
higher up than finn there has to be


argosy

he couldnt order men killed if he
didnt know hed get away with it
that means the city officials are in his
pay or-

  or stanley cut in harshly one
of the state police officials hes cov-
ered thats a cinch but well find out
whos covering him he struck flame
from his lighter relit his cigar what
are you going to do

  go right on working here
stanley frowned it sounds like it
might be dangerous kid but i guess
you can take care of yourself listen
ill give you my phone number and
if anything comes up you can call me
ill see that your father gets the in-
formation give us warning before
finn calls a strike thatll tie up the
whole city stanley penciled a num-
ber on the back of his card there
thatll get me any time

  mccann got to his feet ill be
going then

   stanley said okay im just wait-
ing for davork and then were driv-
ing back to the capitol

mccann left stanley rode down
in an elevator and collected his
belongings from an impersonal desk
sergeant a couple of minutes later he
was pushing through a swinging door
and out into the street

   he went east striding full into the
face of the raw wind he had nearly
reached the center of the block when
the big sedan swung in ahead of him
and rolled across the walk to stop just
a car length down the narrow-walled
alley

  mccann paused eyes shiny with
thought finns car hed have known
that blue and silver paint job anywhere
mccann waited a full half minute
scowling in taut indecision before he

moved close to the building front and
flattened hard against the brick at the
corner of the alley

   he could hear the indistinct rumble
of finns big voice above the low mur-
mur of the engine another man spoke
then and the sound put ridges of
muscle along mccanns jaw hed
heard that harsh nasal twang before

  the car door opened then and
finns voice was plain ill keep in
touch with vou

   do that

  the sedans motor snarled gears
snicked and it was gone mccann
waited footsteps rang hollowly on the
damp concrete came toward him mc-
cann moved as the short figure loomed
in the alley mouth he lowered his
head took two quick steps and
rammed solidly into the short man

   the short man cursed as he stumbled
backward his hat bounced off rolled
toward the gutter why dont you
watch where youre goin 

  mccann mumbled sorry and
scooped up the short mans hat they
were close together when he straight-
ened close enough for mccann to see
a thin mustache thick glasses full lips
and a long pointed chin then the
short man snatched his hat from mc-
canns hand wheeled away

   mccann stared after him said so
long davork in a low bitter voice

author of the quest of the golden lie battle piece etc

back in the old days in san fran-
cisco-this was quite a long while
ago-there was a runner named
linipy who worked for a crimp named mc-
mahon they were a queer outfit artists
in their way if you know what i mean
limpys job as a runner of course was to
go sailing out and meet incoming ships
hed carry his pockets full of bottles and
pass drinks around on a ship hed boarded
while he told what a swell saloon and rest
house mcmahon ran for sailors ashore
according to limpy mcmahon was a reg-
ular mother to land-bound lonely seamen
and the liquor in the bottles limpy passed
around was a sinister janus-faced brew
that caused strong tars to become babes in
limpys arms

  even the biggest and toughest brawlers
who sailed the seven seas wouldnt do a
thing against limpys never-failing drops
they were sure-fire

  by the time the ship was anchored and
tidy the forecastle hands were raging to
get on shore if they didnt go with linipy
theyd go in some other crimps boat and
to some other place since they hadnt
drawn all their pay their skipper was satis-
fied all that they did draw the crimp got
then one morning theyd wake up in a
strange forecastle at sea-with bad head-
aches-and find that the crimp had col-
lected the maximum legal advance on each
man

  so the crimp was satisfied and the
captains were satisfied nobody was an-
noyed except the sailors

  that was the regular trick but limpy
and mcmahon were artists in their line
also mcmahon was an economical soul
it irked him to have a bunch of drunken
forecastle hands around his place break-
ing things and carousing so limpy and

  limpy wasnt very bright about most
things-but his drops were sheer perfec-
tion

mcmahon-being artists-evolved a sim-
pler and more efficient way of doing busi-
ness mcmahon had a place that looked
like a saloon and he had a very special
kind of knock-out drops they were
limpys drops limpy had perfected them
and they were a creation worthy of an
artist

  limpy still acted as runner and met the
ships he described the imaginary delights
to be had in the imaginary saloon-the
non-existent music the mythical dance-
hall girls he got the forecastle hands so
interested that they would jump into his
boat and theyd go to mcmahons and
mcmahon would greet them heartily and
say the first drink was on the house and
theyd drink it limpyd take one too of
course but his never had his drops in it
hed drink his drink and grin at the
others waiting

  the peculiar thing about limpys drops




argosy

was that they hit a mans legs first not
his head

  he couldnt get up

  so limpyd sit there grinning while
mcmahon went off-ostensibly to summon
entertainment and limpyd grin and grin
until one of the sailors tried to get up
and he couldnt and the others would try
and find that they couldnt then limpy
would begin to laugh and hed keep on
laughing in spite of the sailors cursing
him horribly until the drops finished their
work and the men fell bitterly to sleep
and just before theyd go off limpy would
give them a grin and jeer at them have
a nice trip boys hed say and see the
world then limpy would help mcmahon
clean their pockets and carry them out
back-often right into waiting horse-drawn
cabs that took them to another ship that
needed a crew mcmahon never had any
trouble shipping men hed crimped they
werent all soft and groggy from two or
three weeks of drinking they were hard
and ready for duty

  limpy enjoyed his work laughing at
men whod swallowed knock-out drops in
their first drink ashore was just his style
of humor and besides he took inordinate
pride in his artistry he thought nobody
else could do the job with exactly the
finesse with which he did it he even
got uppish to mcmahon he demanded
more money and when mcmahon re-
fused limpy held out on what he took
from the pockets of the unconscious sailors
he felt that the whole business depended
on him

  you see hed perfected the drops

  but mcmahon couldnt see it that way
although there were never any words be-
tween them-mcmahon was too old and
smart a hand to argue with the smartest
crimp that the golden coast had ever seen
-limpy knew that mcmahon was watch-
ing him-and waiting but he wasnt afraid
limpy was smart he knew all the angles-
although they didnt call them angles in
those days-and he knew that mcmahon
wouldnt dare start anything oh sure
limpy was riding high-making pretty

good money and enjoying his joke watch-
ing his drops work on the poor chumps
limpy wouldnt have had his life changed
for anything on this earth

one day limpy sailed out and met a
ship coming in and presently led ri
motley thirsty uproarious mob of fore-
castle hands into mcmahons place and
the first drink was on the house limpy
drank one too but he knew his didnt
have his special drops in it the peculiar
thing about limpys drops-you will re-
call-was that they hit a mans legs first
not his head

  he couldnt get up

  so limpy sat there grinning the joke
for limpy never got stale these men
were looking forward to two or three weeks
of soft uproarious living but limpy knew
that the cabs were already waiting out in
back to carry them to the vestra and the
vestras captain was so tough that even
crimps made him pay extra for his crews
one trip on the vestra was enough for any
sailor

  one trip on the vestra most seafaring
men said was more than enough for any
sailor on any coast

  limpy grinned at them until one of the
sailors tried to get up and couldnt and
then limpy laughed outright then the
rest tried their legs and found them like
sponge and they knew what was the mat-
ter they cursed limpy horribly some of
them tried to crawl toward him to kill
him but their movement just made the
drops work faster

  limpy didnt even bother to move when
they tried to crawl toward him he knew
his drops he laughed until he nearly fell
out of his chair as the cursing men went
one by one to sleep

  then mcmahon appeared at the back
door he grinned at limpy then limpy
started to get up to clean out the mens
pockets and help carry them to the waiting
cabs

 but-

  limpy found that he couldnt get up

  his drops were perfect werent they

at the note pinned

king colt

by luke short

somebody is getting worried two attempts
are made on johnnys life-and as a final
blow a little juggling of the election returns
pushes johnny out of office and blue is
legally declared sheriff once more no sooner
has that happened than johnny and his two
deputies are framed for a bank robbery and
forced to skip town but they dont go far
for johnny is still determined to find picket-
stakes murderer

johnny hendry was perfectly con-
tent to be the easy-goin deputy of an
even easier-goin sheriff in a county that
seemed to be run solely for the benefit of
hard-cases wanted men cattle thieves and
killers johnnys idea was that no real man
ever ran to the law in trouble anyway

 but when old picket-stake hendry
johnnys foster father was reported dead
johnnys mood abruptly changed he wasnt
going to rest until picket-stakes killer had
been brought to the gallows

  johnnys first move is to get himself
elected sheriff nosing out baily blue his
former boss by a scant margin choosing
hank b render and ex-badman turk hebron
for his deputies johnny begins to clean up
the town in grim earnest

  apparently hes a little too successful

this story began in

 a-	

 jdut picket-stake isnt dead at all he
 - shot faster than the man who attacked
 him and has let himself be thought dead just
 to see what johnny would do about it
 picket-stake has found a rich claim but the
 money doesnt matter if young johnny is
 nothing but an amiable neer-do-well

    meanwhile a clue is provided to picket-
  stakes slayer when sample ore turns up
  at the assay office-ore that could only have
  come from picket-stakes saddlebags at-
  tempting to ferret out the mystery hugo
  miller the assayer discovers that the man
  who had brought in the ore and the claim
  papers was merely a more or less innocent
  pawn in this game of gold and death but
  before he can learn any more the man is
  killed and the claim papers stolen miller
  disappointed that the ore hadnt been very
  rich has falsified the assayers report to

the argosy for july 


argosy

make the killer think hed struck it rich
then when he went to the claim miller in-
tended to nab him but now the chase seems
hopeless   

hief among johnnys supporters is
major fitz the manager of the big
syndicate-owned bar  fitzs fellow cat-
tlemen put his name on the list of undesir-
ables they gave to johnny but even so
johnny cant believe that fitz is dishonest

  and yet fitz is the clever spider in the
web of cosmos county crime through
leach wigrans band of desperadoes fitz
has been behind all the robbing and the
rustling it was one of fitzs men who tried
to kill picket-stake and it was another of
fitzs men who found the body of the slain
gunman stole from it the ore that picket-
stake had left for him to find-and died
before fitzs gun when he was no longer
useful to the major it is fitz who has
framed johnny    fitz who worked the elec-
tion swindle that cheated johnny of his star
   and it is fitz who falling into picket-
stakes bandit trap now thinks himself in
possession of the claim papers to a phenom-
enally rich mine

  anxious to maintain the friendship of
johnnys supporters who are the law-abiding
element of the town fitz offers a reward
for the discovery of the real bandits or
for evidence tending to prove johnny inno-
cent of the bank robbery charge

  it is a smart move and completely wins
over people who were beginning to have
doubts of the majors honesty nora the
girl who loves johnny is surer than ever
that fitz is johnnys friend and commis-
sioner bledsoe watching fitz ride away
after posting the reward notice calls the
major the finest man in the whole of cos-
mos county her eyes shining nora agrees
with major fitz on his side how can
johnny hendry lose

chapter xiii

stubborn johnny

johnny remembered a little-known
water hole high in the foothills of
of the calicos that pick had told
him about long ago and it was here they
decided to make their camp it was a
long silent ride for all of them were dis-
heartened at the news johnny had brought
from hugo it meant that every clue they
had to picks killer had vanished and of
the three johnny was the most downcast

outlawry would have meant nothing so
long as he had a chance to even picks
score but now that this was gone these
long and aimless days on the dodge would
be intolerable he resolved grimly not to
remain idle waiting for chance to free
him of these outcast bonds and he had the
wisdom to sense that turk and hank good
men that they were would fret at idle-
ness until one or the other of them would
decide to pull out he must have a plan
something to keep them all busy until they
could pick up again the trail of picks
killer

  the camp did not suit him but in the
circumstances it was the safest tucked
in a fold of a gaunt and up-ended field
of malpais the trail to it was devious and
rocky to cross the malpais would have
meant that the horses hooves would be
cut to ribbons so that it was necesary
to follow a thin ribbon of arroyo which
angled down through the malpais field to
strew its pebbles over the glass-sharp ter-
rain wood had to be hauled there was
no grass but there was a tiny spring of
good water seeping out of a crack in the
black rock and the jagged up-thrust sides
of a canyon afforded them the shelter they
needed if it was hard to get to then it
was all the safer johnny reasoned

  they spent the first day making the
camp livable they raked the sand and
stones out of the arroyo into a small pocket
of the canyon so their horses would have
a place to move around wood was hauled

  in mid-afternoon the work was done
and it was now johnny knew that the
tedium of passive waiting would begin
turk had looked at him several times to-
day with a question in his eyes hank was
more phlegmatic but johnny knew they
were both thinking the same thing

  squatting on his haunches against the
steep side of the canyon johnny rolled a
smoke and contemplated the camp to
turk who was sitting beside him he said
well it aint much turk but then we
wont have to be in it much

  turk looked at him swiftly how come
were hidin aint we
king colt



  hank strolled across to join them now
johnny waited until he too was seated
then said hidin maybe you could call
it that but if you keep movin youre
harder to find than if you sat still arent
you

  but what can we do hank growled
hunt the whole calicos for that claim
jumper that killed pick

  remember the proposition i made you
when i thought i was goin to be sheriff
johnny countered well that still holds
were goin to clean up this county
how

  rustle from rustlers johnny declared
he paused waiting for them to comment
when they didnt he said me im not
goin to let anybody drive me out of this
county i aim to live here also i aim to
be sheriff of it some day and when i am
im goin to drive these hard-cases out
just like i promised well maybe that
days far off but i reckon i can start in
to work right now he grinned also
since i aint sheriff yet i wont be both-
ered by all the laws a sheriff is bothered
with ill fight these jaspers their way
turk looked fondly at him and laughed
i could show you some tricks fella
good thats what i want and hank
can learn em too-just in case hes hard
up for a job some day how about it
hank

  hank grinned and nodded they were
with him johnny knew

  when i thought i was goin to be
sheriff he went on i went to major
fitz with a proposition it was this and
he told them about the lists the ranchers
had given him of the men they believed
should be driven out of the county

  i got the answers johnny finished
who do you think got voted the most
unwanted man in cosmos county
me turk queried

  johnny grinned and shook his head
major fitz

turk was surprised but hank re-
membering things hed seen while
working under fitz on the bar  was

not and johnny seizing on hanks lack
of surprise questioned him youre not
surprised hank why not

  i dunno hank said after a moments
thought there was a time when i thought
fitz was a broad-gauge hombre a man
to ride the river with now i dunno i
think he puts up a good front but some-
thin goes on in his head that we dont
see

   you think he could be a rustler

  t dont see how hank murmured i
worked on the bar  for a long time
none of them boys was doin any con-
siderable night ridin on the other hand
they wasnt a good crew about what you
could expect in a company outfit

   then if fitz doesnt steal cattle howd
his name get at the head of this ranchers
list

  maybe they just got a feelin like i
have hank replied remember that
jasper that tried to get away with the
esmerella gold i cant prove it but i
feel like fitz had somethin to do with
that

  turk said reminiscently i knowed a
bank president once he was the most
pious son of a gun in the world he prayed
longer and louder than anybody in church
come to find out he was makin too much
money out of the bank he was tied up
with a cattle-stealin ring hed pass on
the word to the rustlers about who was
borrowin money to save their places and
their cattle then those folks would be
stole blind and the bank would foreclose
on the place he had a good thing out of
it-and he never wore a gun he looked
at johnny thats what youre hintin
about fitz aint it

  about johnny said

  presently hank said then if some-
bodys doin his rustlin for him who is
it

  what do you say turk johnny
asked you know all those boys
theres only one man doin a real busi-
ness cattle-stealin turk replied thats
leach wigran the rest of them-me too
-wasnt swingin an awful wide loop


argosy

wed take a dozen head here and a dozen
there and then quit for a month until
wed drunk it up once in a while some
of usd get together but leach was the
only broad-gauge cow thief

  then fitz would be backin him
johnny asked

   i never said so

  hed have to be if not these honest
ranchers wouldnt put him ahead of leach
wigran on those lists would they

  why dont you ask emr turk
drawled grinning

  johnnys lean face showed disgust ask
em if theyre scared to sign a name to
those lists theyre scared to say it out
loud arent they

  turk and hank nodded

  all right my plan is danged simple
johnny said grimly i think fitz is be-
hind leach i aim to get proof

  how

  i dunno but im goin to saddle up
in an hour and try to find out you ridin
with me

they were it was decided they would
ride over to leach wigrans spread
perhaps by watching leachs movements
observing as well as they could whom he
talked to who his visitors were and how
he worked they might turn up a clue to
his tie-up with fitz johnny doubted it
however it would be too easy for leach to
ride into town and receive his orders either
from fitz or more likely from some-
body sent by fitz even by letter never-
theless he couldnt afford to pass up any
bets

  but first johnny had another errand
hugo had promised to deliver johnnys
message to nora last night she was to
meet him east of town tonight above the
road to the esmerella mine just after
dark this would be on their way to wig-
rans and johnny timed their ride so that
they approached cosmos just as dusk was
settling into night

  the meeting place was a huge old cedar
on a sloping butte from whose top the
lights of cosmos could plainly be seen

   johnny approached the place cautiously
he saw a horse tied under the tree and
dismounted and walked slowly over

  a voice said johnny and in another
moment nora was in his arms

  johnny laughed huskily as she buried
her face against his chest im a better
outlaw than you think honey he said
gently they havent got me yet

  oh when will this be over johnny
nora asked despairingly today baily
blue got a posse out hunting for you
thats queer johnny murmured try-
ing to see noras face in the dark he
never bothered to do that before

  tip rogers insisted

  tip johnny asked softly so hes
leadin the pack now

  he was responsible for that gold that
was stolen

   does he think i took it

  nora only nodded and johnnys jaw
set a little more grimly in that darkness
this was the way things went then your
friends like a pack of snarling dogs only
waited until you were down to jump on
you

  he led nora over to the tree and they
sat down and johnny asked for more new
from cosmos

  yesterday major fitz posted a thou-
sand dollar reward for the bank robbers
nora said quietly with this provision
that the reward should not apply to the
capture of you or turk or hank she
paused you see he does believe in you
johnny

  johnny said dryly does he

  why do you say that nora asked
swiftly

  remember the ranchers list

  thats foolish nora said vehemently
do you still believe that

  eight men out of ten-all honest-
cant be that far off

  but what evidence have you nora
cried are you going to believe all the
gossip you hear about a friend youre
bitter at tip i know because he believes
the worst of you and now youre doing
the same cruel thing to major fitz
king colt



   johnny had no answer to that still he
couldnt change his convictions it was
useless to tell nora anything his judgment
was based upon it wouldnt convince her
either so he remained silent feeling her
anger against him but stubbornly refus-
ing to try to justify himself

nora was stubborn too id like you
to explain a little johnny you seem to
doubt that major fitz believes in you
he may believe in my ability johnny
said carefully but i doubt if he believes
in the same thing i do-and you do-that
this county deserves to be cleaned up
what cause have you to say that
nora demanded angrily just because
eight sneaking ranchers who hadnt the
courage to accuse a man to his face did
have the courage to do it behind his back
among other things

   what other things

   johnny said wearily darlin you wear
long spurs let it go lets talk about the
weather

   what other things nora insisted
they dont matter johnny said stub-
bornly this vote of the ranchers is good
enough for me

   nora got to her feet and johnny rose to
face her major fitz is my friend nora
said coldly he is yours too

   johnny did not trust himself to speak
first he offered you the foremanship of
the bar  last year nora went on ac-
cusingly then he advised you to run for
sheriff his men all voted for you he was
the first man to approve your scheme of
this poll of undesirables he gave you his
best man to act as your deputy he tore
up heaven and earth for you when he
heard youd been framed and to top
that johnny he has offered a thousand
dollars reward for the real bank robbers
she paused and johnny could almost feel
her contempt and now in your deep
gratitude you believe what eight cowardly
ranchers have to say against him without
giving the least bit of proof she paused
waiting for johnny to speak he didnt
havent you anything to say for yourself
johnny

   youve said it all i reckon johnny
replied huskily stubbornly

   then-then i dont want to see you
again-not until youve changed your
mind nora said haltingly i-i hate-
yes hate-ingratitude more than crook-
edness or stealing or lying or- her voice
broke and she turned away

johnny standing motionless under
the tree watched her mount and ride
off and he could do nothing but deep
inside him he felt a wave of bitterness
and anger and unhappiness that was al-
most blinding automatically he reached
in his pocket and brought out his tobacco
and rolled his cigarette the smoke helped
to calm him but his hands were shaking
so that he could scarcely hold the cigarette

   it was many moments before he could
trust himself to turn and walk over to
where hank and turk were waiting and
he reflected the heart gone out of him
all excuse for his staying here had van-
ished-except one pick when that score
was wiped off the slate he would ride away
even now he couldnt blame nora but
he couldnt understand either why she had
forced herself to choose between their love
and the casual friendship of major fitz
for a moment panic almost seized him
and he was ready to mount his pony and
overtake nora and apologize but even
while he thought it he knew that honesty
would not allow him to do it and that
he was forever a slave-and a willing one
-to that conscience pick hendry had bred
into him

  when he was mounted again turk said
any news

  johnny told him of what nora had said
about fitzs offer turk and hank did not
comment until they had put their horses
up the slope and headed north toward
wigrans

  that makes us look like three prime
saddle-tramps dont it turk observed

  look whats behind it hank said
and johnny saw that hank agreed with
him

  what


argosy

  if hes goin to play out this hand hes
dealt himself hes got to have a front
dont he hank argued sanely he knew
nora would bring this news to us and that
wed think he was our friend hank spat

chapter xiv

bar  steers

leach wigrans running w out-
fit was placed deep in the timbered
foothills of the calicos johnny remem-
bered that it was a big frame place built
in the dead center of a grassy valley so
that no one could approach it without
being seen while leach had not built it
it seemed as if this place was designed
for a man of his shady business remote
inaccessible in the heart of a wide good
range with a thousand canyons behind it
it was a perfect headquarters for a cattle
thief

  they had left the road long since and
were now making their slow way through
the tall lodgepoles when johnny spotted
a light off to the right and below them

thats the runnin w turk said

  we cant move till daylight johnny
said so we might as well pick a com-
fortable spot

  it was just breaking dawn when they
had settled on their place of observation
it was on a high wooded ridge which af-
forded perfect cover yet allowed them a
good view down through the tall avenue
of trees to the valley below

  while they were not close enough to
identify individual riders going into the
running w they were near enough to
the road to ride dowti for a closer view

  slowly color began to bloom over the
gray landscape and day marched forward
smoke began to rise from the chimneys of
the running w and johnny settled down
to watch while turk and hank rolled
up in their blankets for an hour of sleep

  soon a strange and distant noise came
riding down from the south on the faint
wind johnny listened head cocked in an-
other moment he identified it the sound
of a herd of bawling cattle cannot be mis-

taken for long they were being driven
up the narrow valley to the running w

  johnny moved over to hank and turk
about to wake them and then decided tc
let them sleep he could do this job alone
and they were in no danger of discovery

   so putting the bridle back on his horse
which was grazing with its saddle still on
he mounted and worked his way down the
slope he hurried for the sound of the
driven cattle was becoming plainer every
minute when he came to a sprawling
thicket of scrub oak he raised up in his
saddle and looked down through the trees
here he could get a good view of the
road he tied his horse in the screening
oak then went forward and down the slope
a way and hid himself in the brush

  presently the point rider appeared the
cattle strung out in a long bawling line be-
hind him johnny caught the brand on
this riders horse and it was a running
w

  then through the cloud of dust that
the shuffling herd was kicking up johnny
tried to read the brands on the cattle he
saw one he thought was a bar  but
knew he might be mistaken he could not
be sure because these cattle were branded
on the right hip and he was on their left
side but he was patient knowing that
sooner or later he would have the chance
to make sure

  and he did one of the weary steers
angled out of the herd and began to graze
turning back to get some fresh bunchgrass
and johnny saw with amazement that he
had been right these were bar  steers
still he could not believe it for this did
not fit in with his theory but when a
calf pushed ahead in the crush finally
broke loose and turned around and started
bawling for its mother johnny was cer-
tain bar  cattle

  when they were past he walked back
to his horse mounted and turned up the
slope his face thoughtful hank and turk
had been awakened by the noise of the
herd and they had guessed where johnny
had gone

  whose were they turk asked sleepily
king colt



   bar  believe it or not johnny said
grimly hank sat bolt upright in his
blankets

  well til be sunk in sheep dip he
said slowly looking at johnny leach is
sposed to be workin for fitz where does
that put us

  in the wrong turk ventured
johnny squatted on his haunches and
sifted gravel through his fingers staring
thoughtfully at the ground does leach
bring all his rustled stuff up to this place
johnny asked turk

  mostly he drives it over to warms
its too easy to track up to here he aint
got enough rock and rough weather and
wind and rain and hard goin here and
thats what you need to steal cattle
then why is he doin it

  turk shrugged johnny was silent for a
full minute and then he rose and savagely
threw down his handful of gravel

  this dont make no sense at all he
looked up at hank you reckon fitz sold
or give him those cattle

  might be-in payment for a job or
somethin

   im goin to find out

  how

  backtrack and see if the boys even
tried to hide the tracks of this herd if
they did it might be they stole the beef
if they didnt itd mean fitz knew about
them bein moved

an hour later the three of them rode
down off the slopes to the valley bot-
tom and picked up the sign of the cattle
an hour of following the tracks showed
them that the running w men had taken
no pains to cover up cattle signs a two-
hour drive to the east in the rocky moun-
tain going would have afforded the run-
ning w men a terrain which would make
the tracking of the beef less easy ap-
parently then they were making no at-
tempt to conceal the drive although they
had been careful to avoid the roads

  it was only when they did not find a
bed ground or place where the riders had
camped that johnny became suspicious

again if they were drivin bought beef
theydve stopped to make a camp
wouldnt they and rest the stuff

  sure turk said its a two-day
drive from fitzs place if they didnt push
em

   lets go on johnny said grimly they
looked pushed

   in mid-afternoon hank riding ahead as
a sort of scout wheeled his horse and rode
back pull off in the brush he said
somebody else has the same idea as us

   they turned off behind a ridge into the
brush and dismounted johnny mounted
the ridge and bellied down to see who
was coming

   a lone rider came into sight-kennicott
one of the ranchers johnny had seen some
days ago he was riding at a fast walk
eyes on the ground

  it wasnt his beef johnny mused
why is he cuttin sign for it

   when kennicott came to the place where
johnny and turk and hank had pulled
off the trail of the cattle he reined up
for a moment he stared at their tracks
then up at the ridge and suddenly whirled
and spurred his horse off into the brush
a minute later johnny caught sight of
kennicotts horse heading back in the di-
rection from which he had come

   johnny returned to the horses and told
what he had seen

   kennicott hank exclaimed it aint
his beef

  maybe he was as curious as we was
turk offered

  johnny remembered that kennicott
might be one of the eight who accused
fitz more evidence he turned a thought-
ful face to the south its about time i
talked to hugo wilks he murmured
ive got to find out whats goin on in
town

  they stopped on the outskirts of cos-
mos just after midnight the town as in
the days before johnny hendrys brief
spell of sheriffin was roaring wide open
the saloons were a bedlam of noise oc-
casional gunshots racketed down the
street a ranny dead drunk in his saddle


argosy

galloped past without even seeing them

  johnny made his way carefully down
the back alleys until he arrived at hugos
a pencil of light lay under the rear door
johnny moved over to the window and
looked in before he knocked hugo his
feet tilted on his desk was deep in a book

  at johnnys entrance he rose and
frowned ive been worried hugo said
regarding johnny with fond seriousness
blue was out this morning lookin for
you with a posse

  johnny grinned and sat down hell
never find us weve got a safe hide-out
thats what he said when he came
back hugo observed dryly

  came back johnny echoed you
mean he only looked for us one morn-
ing

  oh tip rogers is still out but blue
was called back to town by business
major fitz had a herd of beef stolen
ah johnny said did he

  he and his men rode into town this
morning and started yelling for blue it
seems a herd of his just vanished hugo
shook his head the hard-cases will start
working on fitz now since he put up that
reward money fitz thinks thats whats
behind the rustling

  does he now johnny murmured
hugo looked sharply at him his
curiosity awakened by the tone of johnnys
voice for a moment johnny was tempted
to tell hugo what he suspected of major
fitz but he refrained if he was wrong
in his guess-and he was sure he wasnt
-it would not be fair to fitz besides a
secret can be kept only by a few he
said quickly to hugo did blue go out
with fitz

  out and back the rustlers drove the
stuff into the mountains blue said and
didnt leave a sign hugo smiled wryly
its the old excuse

  into the mountains johnny mur-
mured smiling privately so blue give
up

  he did fitz was helpless

johnny looked at hugo with some
curiosity has anyone claimed that it was

me and turk and johnny that stole fitzs
stuff

hugo shook his head fitz killed that
story right off he said it was five men
besides he said youd be the last man in
the world to touch a head of bar  cattle
well well johnny drawled

  again hugo looked at him sharply he
said suddenly impulsively whats got
into you johnny youre changed

  a slow flush darkened johnnys lean
and browned cheeks he cuffed his stetson
back on his forehead changed

   are you lettin this frame-up sour you
boy

  no johnny said stubbornly why
just a look in your eyes like you
dont give a tinkers curse any more he
paused as if wondering how what he was
about to say would be received this is
none of my business johnny but have
you had a row with nora

  have you asked her

  again hugo shook his head no but
shes got the same look in her eyes that
youve got-a nothing-matters-now look
besides when i asked her what you
planned to do after she saw you last night
she didnt say a word hugo grinned dis-
armingly maybe thats all right but ive
got an interest in your career too boy
maybe you better ask her hugo as
for me johnny said slowly you know
how i feel about nora-how i always will
feel no that hasnt changed he rose
and hiked up his levis nothin new
about picks claim

  hugo only shook his head at the door
johnny turned and said briefly itll be
some time before you see me again hugo
take care of nora will you

  and with that he slipped out into the
night back at the horses he said to turk
and johnny fitz had a herd of beef
stole blue went out to take a look and
come back with the story that the herd
got clean away

  aint that too bad turk murmured
sarcastically a jasper that couldnt track
a ten-horse freight hitch across an alkali
flat could have followed that herd
king colt



paused turk waited for hank to say
something

  hank said only well dont that prove
that fitz wanted leach wigran to get
away with the stuff

  so it would look to the town like the
hard-cases was fightin fitz now johnny
put in grimly thats what he wants
and-here his voice took on a tone of
quiet savagery-thats whats goin to
happen

  us bein the hard-cases turk mur-
mured

  right johnny said and when we
end up fitz wont know whether he can
trust his own mother

chapter xv

trail drive

just after dark two nights later
johnny was sitting in the dark door-
way of one of the bar  line camps smok-
ing the night was quiet about him the
only sounds were those his saddled pony
made cropping the grass out in the dark
johnny had been there an hour during
which he had smoked eight cigarettes
lately he had found himself restless and
impatient and time and again he had to
put a check on his temper which had
always been quick deep within him he
knew why he was edgy but he wouldnt
admit it right now he was fuming in-
wardly at turk and hanks tardiness for-
getting the fact that the running w was
many miles from here and that they
would have to be careful in covering their
movements

  when he heard the sound of approach-
ing riders he faded back into the doorway
drawing his gun then hanks low and
cautious whistle came to him and he
stepped out to meet them

  get it he asked hank

  turk answered instead sure and hes
lame now what luck did you have

  theyre spread out below us right now
without a man ridin herd

  then lets get to work hank said
briefly

  it was a horse branded running w that
johnny had referred to the three of them
mounted hazed the extra horses and the
lame one ahead of them and rode the short
distance down to the flat over the rolling
tilting upland of grass a big herd of bar
 cattle were grazing some of them
bedded down

  out of this bunch they cut a hundred
and fifty head and then turned and pushed
east toward the mountains the lame run-
ning w gelding along with the three other
ponies was pushed in with the cattle

  it was turk giving orders now for he
knew every one of these devious trails and
could pick out the few water holes they
would need on their way over the calicos
at dawn next morning they paused to let
the herd drink at one of the high moun-
tain springs

  before they pushed on toward the pass
in the gaunt peaks the gelding was cut
out and left behind he seemed willing
to drop out for he was limping badly
johnny reasoned that he would rest here
by the spring until hunger drove him down
on the flats

  all that day they prodded the cattle
into the face of a gathering storm that
broke in mid-afternoon half blinding them
with sleet and hail and rain for an hour
they worked furiously to keep the cattle
headed up the mountains into the storm
and just when the exhaustion of their
ponies was ready to defeat them the rain
slacked off into a steady drizzle

  his eyes red-rimmed and bloodshot
turk rode back to johnny who was riding
drag both of them were drenched even
through their slickers and the cold driv-
ing wind that poured down from the peaks
had their lips blue

  itll be dark before we make the pass
you want to try it

  if we let these critters stop dynamite
couldnt keep em from goin back johnny
said he raised his eyes to the sky which
seemed almost low enough to touch they
were far above timberline now in the boul-
der fields of the peaks and all nature here
seemed merciless bent on breaking them


argosy

he shouted into the wind can we do it
turk

  sure youll lose some of the stuff
likely and be pretty doggoned miserable
but we can do it

   all right lets change ponies

  they took turns cutting fresh mounts
out and dropping back to saddle the herd
was not allowed to stop

as night settled down on them they
knew they were in for it the rain
held on increasing the misery of man and
beast a dozen times that night the cattle
were on the verge of stampeding every
time they rounded a fresh bend in this
tortuous trail and the wind drove at them
with the force of padded hammers johnny
and hank were driven to a fury of ac-
tivity johnny never knew where they were
going what the country looked like or
if turk was lost it was his job and hanks
to keep the herd moving    and some-
how they did it

  toward morning the wind died down
and the rain lifted a little so that johnny
almost drowsed off in the saddle he could
tell by the ease with which his horse
walked and by the increased pace of the
cattle that they were through the pass and
on the gentle down-slope of the eastern side
of the calicos

  dawn broke cold and clear and in an-
other hour they reached timberline al-
ready behind them the thunderheads were
gathering for a new downpour when they
got to the green belt of trees they conferred
and decided to rest the cattle and let them
graze on the hardy upland bunchgrass if
they could pursuit was hardly probable
since a fresh storm would be almost cer-
tain to blot out the tracks

   a half day of sleep and dry clothes lifted
their spirits at noon after a quick lunch
they got the cattle moving again turk
with the experience of many such drives
behind him took them down the slope
through the thick timber until when dark
fell they were in the foothills

  warms turk said was off several miles
to the right they were heading for the

railway station and stock pens that turk
had used in his rustling days a crooked
agent no brand inspector and a split of
the rustled beef would allow them to dis-
pose of it without so much as a trace to
indicate where it had gone

   close to midnight they saw the lights
of the way station turk had ridden ahead
to confer with the agent when johnny and
hank arrived with the beef the pens were
open ready to receive it

   therell be a train out of warms to-
morrow morning turk informed them
itll pick the stuff up he grinned up at
johnny i signed leach wigrans name
on the waybill that all right

  johnny nodded next morning in the
mining town of warms johnny opened an
account at the warms bank in the name
of leach wigran he arranged for the
deposit of the money from the sale of
the cattle shipment if fitz got curious
and searched for his herd leach wigrans
name would be dark with guilt

  a few moments later he joined hank
and turk on the main four corners they
looked at each other and smiled they
each needed a shave clean clothes and
rest johnny in spite of his bone-weari-
ness felt something driving in him that
would not let him rest his eyes were hard
and mocking as he said to turk you
work for what you get in this rustling
business turk i didnt know that

  where now hank asked

  cosmos this has only begun

in place of barney who had been
segundo under carmody fitz had ap-
pointed a silent surly puncher named art
bodan who was years younger than he
looked fitz didnt know much about him
except that carmody said he was to be
trusted

  so that morning when bodan had fin-
ished his story in fitzs office the major
regarded him with some curiosity and a
little suspicion

  you say you found the horse down on
the flat grazing how do you know he
was the one whose track you saw
king colt



  i know bodan said stubbornly rain
or no rain thats the same horse hes not
only crippled in the same foot but the
other tracks tally he paused his dark
smooth-shaven face sullen you cant
track an animal for ten miles without you
learn somethin about his tracks major
fitz said nothing for the moment his
face scowling and unpleasant to look at
running w it couldnt be a changed
brand could it

  come out and look for yourself

  ill do that fitz said and rose
outside he paused at the corral while
bodan cut out the lame gelding and led
him over to fitz turning him so that fitz
could investigate the brand

  thats real all right fitz said he
straightened up youre not to say any-
thing about this of course

  three of the men know it aready
saddle up my bay fitz said and
turned to the house

  an hour later he rode into the main
street of cosmos and dismounted at baily
blues office he did not need to cover up
his visits now since it was known that
as a victim of rustlers he had legitimate
business with the sheriff blue was not in
but fitz sat down and smoked his pipe
staring thoughtfully out the window

  when baily finally did come in is
leach in town fitz asked when bailey
nodded fitz said bring him here

  blues eyebrows lifted that aint very
cautious fitz

  bring him here and do it in a hurry
blue vanished ten minutes later he was
back with the hulking wigran in tow
leach wigran seldom talked to the major
never recognized him in public and that
blue should call him to an open conference
with fitz was a surprise to him his face
almost hidden by that thick shovel beard
showed a surprise which he could not en-
tirely disguise

  sit down fitz said abruptly when the
door was shut

  leach sat down facing him holding his
hat in his hand blue leaned on the desk
watchi ng

  this morning bodan my segundo
came in with the news that ive been
rustled of a hundred and fifty head of
cattle he cut for sign and found where
theyd been driven np the calicos the
rain had washed away the sign there but
he saw enough to know that whoever stole
those cattle had a lame horse that horse
was finally turned loose up by a spring
in the calicos and it drifted down to my
range he leaned forward and regarded
leach with careful eyes we found the
horse it was branded running w leach
leach stopped fiddling with his hat his
great hands still running w he echoed
theres some mistake were missin no
horses

  i saw it and its branded running w
fitz said sharply

  then somebody stole it

  whereve you been these last four
nights fitz asked him coldly

  why-a couple of em i reckon i was
here in cosmos

  your men were-where

  slowly leach heaved himself to his feet
and regarded fitz with hot eyes so you
think i took em fitz

  i didnt say so i want to know who
did

  i dunno but i know i didnt and none
of my men did i can account for the whole

crew

  fitz said nothing and leach after hold-
ing his gaze for several seconds turned to
baily blue as if for help blue however
kept his face carefully blank

  and then leach started to get red
fitz he said hotly ive danced to your
tune for two years now ive had many a
chance to hang the deadwood on you but
ive not been a hog ive kept in line and
taken your orders and i aim to from now
on

  then whered the horse come from
fitz asked gently he was being ridden
by the men who took that beef

i tell you he could have been stole
by whom then fitz drawled now
his voice got ugly when i hired you
leach you promised me that youd keep


argosy

these small rustlers in order and have
them let me alone apparently-and here
his voice was dry thrusting-youre los-
ing your ability to keep on top in this
county leach maybe somebody has an
idea that youve got a little soft a little
easy what do you think

  id like to see em claim it leach
said uglily

  what do you call this then they
stole a herd of my cattle and put the blame
on you either that or your men think
youre soft too do they

  leach took a shuffling step toward fitz
his face dark with anger they do what
i tell em he said thickly they arent
crossin me they know itd be worth their
life if they did

  then who is these small time rustlers
you thought you could kick around

   i still can

fitz rose now he came scarcely to
leachs shoulder but there was a look
of hard and implacable command in his
eyes and on his face that told blue that
fitz was the stronger man always had
been always would be

  leach fitz said mildly i cant use
a second-rater ive made money for you
and ill make more but not if you cant
keep your men in line if youre through
get out while you still have a chance if
you arent licked then straighten this out
get back my cattle for me and see that
the man responsible is punished he
paused and leach if youre considering
stepping into my shoes dont ive taken
care of a dozen like you in my day and
it wasnt any trouble-only a little messy
he stepped past leach and out the door
closing it gently behind him for a long
minute leach stood in the middle of the
floor clenching and unclenching his fists
his face hard and savage and entirely
readable

  blue shifted his weight on the desk and
cleared his throat

  dont get any ideas leach he said
softly

  leach looked at him now and there

was bewilderment in his eyes but i aint
i know when im well off but i dont
have any idea who took them cattle not

a one

  find out

  i aim to

  blue smiled faintly but dont ever get
any ideas about fitz leach he goes with
good people here his credit is good hes
polite the decent women like him and
he acts considerable like a dude sometimes
but dont let that fool you he jerked
a thumb over his shoulder out there at
the bar  he hasnt got what youd
rightly call a crew of punchers once just
for fun i added up how much reward
money id collect if id take that bar 
crew nail em up in a boxcar and ship em
back to where they were wanted the re-
ward money came to over a hundred thou-
sand dollars

  leach was listening his eyes veiled
fitz sends for them he gives them
protection work and good wages until
things have cooled off for them nobody
knows their right names except him-and
sometimes me they aint common gun-
fighters leach-theyre killers tested
wanted gunslick hair-trigger killers so
dont get any ideas and if i was you
id see that them cattle was back at the
bar  in pretty short order

  i will

  when leach stepped out onto the street
he was considerably chastened-and he
was angry too he knew that what baily
blue told him about fitz was true with-
out ever raising his voice fitz could put
more genuine fear into leach than an army
of ordinary men with guns

  leach went into the bar at princes keno
parlor and downed a stiff drink then he
walked to the gambling tables where four
of his men were playing an idle hand ol
poker

  come along he told them

  one puncher young tall with several
days growth of reddish stubble on his face
threw down his cards and looked up at
leach more work

  leach nodded grimly plenty mick

chapter xvi

rustlers war

once on the road to the running w
leach motioned mickey hogan to
drop behind the other two mickey was
leachs foreman his top hand and gun-
fighter it was mickey who enabled leach
to keep peace among his twenty hands-
saddle-bums and saloon riffraff

  how much time did fitz give us
mickey asked when leach had finished
he never said

  ill need a couple of days anyway
you got any ideas

  well theres them winkler brothers
up in that old ophir mine theyre a tough
crew and they dont like us much

  mickey shook his head maybe not but
theyre plumb scared of us theyre out
leach named a list of men known as
rustlers but at each name mickey shook
his head nevertheless when they reached
the running w mickey took only the time
to change horses before he rode off with
five of his men for leach the rest of that
day and the next was intolerable the
longer mickey stayed away the more cer-
tain leach grew that he was having no luck
in tracking down the rustlers

  and that was true in the beginning
mickeys first visit was to the winkler boys
up in the old abandoned ophir mine they
were insolent but they offered an alibi
which mickey had to accept three of them
were down sick with their blankets pulled
around them rifles slacked in their arms
they stood in the doorway and faced
mickey and his five riders

  all right mickey said i reckon
youre tellin the truth but if i thought
you wasnt   

  youd blow our heads off winkler
said well ride on hogan youve come
to the wrong place when we steal any-
thing you want well admit it and be ready
to scrap for it you can tell that to your
boss

  i believe you mickey said mildly and
wheeled his horse out

  so mickey made the rounds on the aft-
ernoon of the second day he and his riders
pulled up at cass briggs place in the bot-
tomlands of a creek over on the west edge
of the county

  cass was drunk and belligerent steal
fitzs stuff he said thickly why why
shouldnt a man his beef will walk just
as good as another mans wont it
mickey regarded him thoughtfully
take a pasear around the corrals boys
he said to his men

  cass straightened up wait a minute
he said loudly youll find tracks over
there but no beef i had five head here
until last night

  whose beef

  kennicotts cass answered sullenly
  mickey said look around boys

while they were gone mickey
watched cass whose increasingly
furtive air he could not quite understand
mickey in the course of his business was
pretty well acquainted with these shifty
close-mouthed men who practiced on a
small scale what leach wigran did on a
large one he knew their hideout their
markets their methods their needs and
their characters it was another world re-
mote from the brisk and businesslike air
of cosmos but one in which mickey was
thoroughly versed

  the running w riders returned
theres been cattle out there all right
how many

  i dunno

  mickey returned his attention to cass
i havent seen you in town much lately
cass

  i been here

  you couldnt have been somewhere else
-say over on bar  range-with george
winkler could you

   i tell you i been here cass said irri-
tably

  or over the calicos in warms mickey
went on idly maybe these bad rains up
in the calicos is what stove up those
winkler boys mickey was talking idly
hit or miss giving little attention to what


argosy

he said but he saw now that something
he had said had touched cass cass tried
to look him in the eye but failed

   i was here cass said sullenly

  but with the winkler boys though
cass spat all right what if they was
over

  so they were

  cass straightened up defiantly any-
thing wrong with asking your friends over
to have a few drinks when mickey said
nothing he added they got drunk and
slept outside i couldnt help that could
i

  mickey didnt answer immediately
presently he said thats funny cass
that you five should have been together
just for a parley he paused so you did
drive the beef over to warms

  we did not cass said hotly i sold
em my share for the price of a couple of
bottles

  mickey said quickly your share of
what beef

   kennicotts

  i thought you said you only got five
head

  that was my share i said we worked
it together

  i hadnt heard anything about it in
town mickey said gently usually ken-
nicott squawks the loudest

  he dont know it cass mumbled
mickey let his hand fall to his gun
cass he said gently youre lyin
what did you do with that bar  beef
drive it over to warms

  i dunno what youre talkin about
cass said earnestly dont get so quick
mickey come in and have a drink i tell
you it wasnt no bar  beef i dunno
whose it was i was drunk and so was
they we just took it from over west of
town and drove it down here in the breaks
and then we come home and we was drunk
for a couple of days i sold em my share
mickey drew his gun raised it cass
you and the winklers took that bar 
beef none of youve been around cosmos
for a week now the winkler boys are
stove up from that mountain rain no-

bodys missin beef except fitz are you
goin to tell me you stole it

  i didnt cass cried

  mickey smiled and leveled his gun cass
made a lunge to get inside the house but
mickeys gun roared before cass could
make a move

slowly cass started to claw at his
chest and then he sat down abruptly
and his head sagged down on his chest

  mickey regarded him coldly i never
thought hed have the nerve he said
mildly he shrugged well the beefs
gone lets go back to the winklers

  it was midnight before mickey rode into
the running w he and his riders had a
little trouble with the winklers had had
to burn them out which took a little time
however mickey had a feeling of a job
well done as he lifted his saddle on the
corral poles and walked toward the house

  the front room of the running w was
bare and cluttered with gear and filthy
with dust and papers at mickeys en-
trance leach jumped to his feet his hand
traveling toward his gun by the light of
the single lamp leach looked deathly pale

  mickey puzzled closed the door behind
him whats the matter leach youre
spooky

  leach regarded him with red-rimmed
bloodshot eyes an hour after you left
one of the boys rode in with word that
the herd of beef we was holdin for fitz
is stole too

  mickey said softly stole

  drove over the calicos i been out
trackin it but it was took to warms sure
as hell

  how long had it been gone

  a couple of days

  mickey sank into a chair and he and
leach looked at each other then i
mustve made a mistake mickey said
quietly and he told leach about cass and
the winklers leach didnt even show in-
terest he sat there his head sunk on his
chest staring at the table presently he
said mickey i can make this good with
fitz i mean i got the money to do it
king colt



but-and he raised harried eyes to re-
gard mickey-what am i goin to tell
him that theyve got us on the run

 who

  i wish i knew leach said savagely
fitz aint pleasant to face this time hes
going to be wild

  mickey thought a long moment tell
him you found cass and the winkler boys
with the beef high up in the calicos you
took care of them all right and then you
got to thinkin and you decided to drive
the stuff over to warms-all of it so long
as you was close as you was then give
him the money what can he say
hell know im lyin

  hed never know i was lyin mickey
said quietly

  leach seemed not to hear this for sev-
eral moments and then he raised his head
with a jerk thats it mickey you tell
him can you do it

  i never seen the lie i couldnt tell with
a straight face mickey boasted quietly
sure ill tell him

  right now you ride over right now
wait till tomorrow mickey drawled
thatll give us time enough to have drove
the beef over and come back

  mickey started out at sunup for the bar
 at dark he was not back he did not
return that night nor the next day at
midnight he was still not back leach his
eyes frantic paced up and down the room
listening occasionally

  some time that night as leach lay on
the rough and soiled sofa staring at the
ceiling a thunderous knock on the door
brought him to his feet with a leap gun
out

  he waited a moment and then crossed
to the door listening his hand on the knob
then gathering himself he yanked the
door open

  something was standing there on the
sill instinctively protectively wildly
leach fired but the body did not move
it simply toppled into the room at leachs
feet

  leach looked down at it it was mickey
he was dead and stiff on his chest was

pinned a note and stooping slowly leach
read it

this was a mistake leach get that

  beef back or get out

  and leach trembling there in the gut-
tering flame of the lamp knew that war
was declared and he was afraid

chapter xvii

gunfire by night

when tip rogers wakened and
struck a match to look at his watch
it was seven oclock he knew that if he
was to get down to the dining room and
eat supper before it closed he would have
to hurry with his shave two days and one
night in the saddle heading a posse had
left him stiff and sore but he was refreshed
after fourteen hours of sleep

  down in the lobby and heading for the
dining room he thought of nora inside
and his face settled into gravity he knew
that she must hate him now for the stand
he had taken against johnny and he hated
it too but the honesty in him would not
let him do otherwise

  the dining room was almost empty
major fitz and bledsoe were seated at a
side table in the corner and major fitzs
harsh and dogmatic voice could be heard
the length of the dining room

  tip took a table and nora who had
been standing listening to major fitz came
over to take his order surprisingly she
smiled at him and tip smiled warmly in
return too late to get anything to eat
nora

  nora shook her head no i had the
cook save something for you tip
hungry

  watch me

  when she returned with his food and
sat down opposite him he observed her
carefully she was a little pale but her
eyes looked bright almost feverish and her
talk and even her actions were animated
tip made a vow that he would not bring
into the conversation any mention of


argosy

things that might upset her such as his
activities of the last few days

  nora however spoiled this resolution
with her first question

  did you have any luck with the posse
tip she asked

  tip looked up at her his face coloring
of course not if i had id have brought
them in

  not shot them

  tip shook his head why should i i
liked johnny hendry maybe he didnt do
what he was accused of but hell never
prove his innocence by running away
there was a quizzically probing expres-
sion in her eyes she said

  youd have brought him back to stand
trial then-for his own good

  tip grinned and shook his head no
ill be honest not for his good but for
mine i wont pass up a chance to find out
who robbed the bank and got the gold
nora didnt answer for a moment and
then she said quietly perhaps thats what
he needs tip somebody ought to scare
him to make him prove his innocence even
if he didnt take the gold

  tip laid down a fork and stared at her
as if he had not heard rightly nora
laughed a little self-consciously and said
why not johnny treats other people that
way why should he expect more in re-
turn

  her voice shook a little with anger
but tip was too much in love to see
that noras displeasure with johnny
hendry was dictated by her mind
it was something she felt-and tried
to feel-because she thought she
should

  treats them how

  oh he makes snap judgments believes
the worst of people hes unfair and un-
just

  you think thats the kind of treatment
ive given him

  nora nodded and said a little but i
cant blame you tip youre only doing
your job

   and one i dont like tip said quietly
nora did not answer tip ate in silence

frowning at his plate suddenly he raised
his eyes to noras face believe me nora
i dont like this i know how you feel about
johnny and i could understand why youd
hate me for what im doing

  how do i feel about johnny nora
asked bluntly looking him in the eye

  why-why-ive been seeing you for
over a year nora even since i came here
-when i ask you to marry me you just
laugh and youve been just as nice even
nicer to johnny hendry but when he
walks in the room youre different hes
the one my name could be ted or jim
or bob and youd treat me the same dont
you see i may be one in a hundred but
johnny is one in a million-to you maybe
he always will be

  all the while tip was speaking the flush
on noras face was deepening when he
was finished nora said swiftly tip thats
not true youve been imagining it i-i
dont love johnny hendry maybe for a
while i was infatuated with him but i
dont love him and ive tried to treat
you both the same-because i really do
feel the same about you

  her eyes blazed

  tips mouth sagged open and he could
not speak for a moment

  i know but-

  and thats not because johnny is in
trouble nora said defiantly im just
as loyal to him as i ever was tip ive
talked to him since he was framed if i
wanted to i could take you to his hideout
but i wont so you see im not desert-
ing him in his hard luck only i dont
want you or anybody else tip rogers to
think i love him i dont

wisely tip held his silence but he
allowed himself a broad grin and as
nora watched him the fire died out in
her eyes and she began to smile suddenly
they both laughed together

  finish your eating tip nora said
im almost ashamed of myself

  tip lifted his plate off to one side and
leaned both hands on the table and he
began to speak in utter seriousness

  today nora when i got in from the
mountains i went up to the esmerella
sammons the manager had some news for
me he paused watching her he said
the esmerella will have to close im out
of a job he offered me one with the same
company down near the mexican border
im not going

  but tip why not

  because i found out something tonight
if you like me as well as you do johnny
hendry then im going to stay here until
you like me better and the only time ill
take that job down there is when i can
write the manager and tell him that hell
have to provide quarters for a new superin-
tendent-and wife her name will be
nora

  nora smiled shyly youre nice tip
  nora will you marry me

  i-i dont know tip nora said
everything has happened so quickly tip
give me time please

  tip reached out for her hand and spread
her fingers out in his palm on his own
little finger was a ring its band of silver
its stone of deep blue turquoise he took
it off and slipped it quickly on her middle
finger

  tip said gently the indian who gave
that to me nora told me that as soon as
my greatest luck had come to pass the
ring on to somebody else i wished luck
for if you take it my luck has come will
you wear it

  his hand relinquished hers as if he
didnt want to put the slightest pressure
on her

  slowly nora raised her eyes to his is

this an engagement ring tip

  its for you to name tip said gravely
 want it to be that

  nora looked down at the ring it was
beautiful its stone cool and smooth and
deep but she was thinking of what this
ring symbolized what she could make it
symbolize-a new life with a man she
liked a man who was steady and honest
and patient whom she could depend on
who would not change over the years who
while he would not make her laugh and
 a-

cry and be angry with him would be as
predictable as a calendar as steady as
the sun in its course it would be refuge
and security something she sorely needed
and wanted now but did she love him
she looked up at his face and saw tips
quiet love for her shining out of eyes that
were honest and very grave for a mo-
ment she remembered johnnys eyes care-
less- mocking affectionate light-hearted
quick as mercury-

  lets call it an engagement tip she
said softly stubbornly and she hardly
realized she had said it until she felt tips
kiss on her lips she laughed then and
pushed tip back in his seat

  your supper is cold and youve got
to eat tip she told him but tip was
only looking at her filling his eyes with
the beauty of her nora rose and went out
into the kitchen

while she was gone a man entered
the dining room and looked around
him waved to tip and went over to fitz
and bledsoes table it was les mac-
mahon a tall slim young man in careful
black clothes who studied law at nights
and waited on customers at bledsoes store
in the daytime tip was friendly with him
and liked him macmahon talked quietly
with fitz and bledsoe for some minutes
and nora returned with hot food for tip
she sat down by him again and made
tip eat

  presently macmahon left bledsoes
table and came over to speak to tip and
nora is it true the esmerella has closed
down tip he asked his sharp face was
inquisitive amiable tip nodded what
are you going to do leave town

  tip looked at nora and smiled slightly
no chance ill do something around
here

  macmahon leaned down and talked
quietly i just had a funny experience
tip six men-i dont know who they were
-came in the store and started buying
supplies-mining tools blankets grub
black powder and such one of them the
man doing the buying was drunk he


argosy

started talking to me about their claims
said they were the richest hed ever seen
he told me quite a bit about them before
the boss came over and shut him up
tip leaned forward his eyes intent and
excited

  did he say where they were
macmahon flushed i know this sounds
silly tip but to begin with they bought
about a thousand dollars worth of sup-
plies this drunk was bragging around that
their assay showed higher than any mine
that was being operated around here i
thought it was bluff but when theyd gone
out i went over to the claim-recording
office sure enough six men had just filed
claims together there furthermore they
just bought a dozen pack mules from mc-
grew down at the feed stable does that
sound like its a bluff they paid cash for
everything

  it doesnt tip conceded were they
mining men

  looked it

  what do you want me to do tip
asked interested now

  youre free now you know minerals
get their locations at the recorders office
and go out and if it looks good file on
some claims i just told bledsoe and fitz
they said if i could get a good man to
look it over to put their names down ill
want one too he indicated nora so
will nora wont you

  whatever tip thinks nora answered
tip scowled he had been around min-
ing camps long enough to understand that
fabulous mines had been discovered on just
such thin rumors a drunken boast an in-
cautious poker bet a brag on a street
corner had been the start of many a pay-
ing mine he was free now with no job to
hold him in town besides that he hoped
he wrould soon have a wife to support and
it had been tips dream that some day he
would own a small paying mine perhaps
this was the chance he had been waiting
for

  ill do it he said slowly only dont
be disappointed when i come back and
tell you its phoney

  macmahon drew up a chair and soon
they were deep in mining talk macmahon
had copied out the claim locations and
now he gave them to tip they discussed
tips outfit his expenses and such and
while they talked nora listened content
only to watch tip she liked his quiet
gravity the slow and careful way that he
arrived at decisions the temperance of his
speech and the dry humor that crept into
much he said and she knew too that he
would never change that this was the way
he was made and the way he would always
be moreover she knew deep within her
that if her life with him would be dull at
times it would be a generous life with re-
wards and riches at the end

  bledsoe and fitz came over and nora
rose and went about her business of clear-
ing off the dishes later when she returned
to the dining room tip was at the door
waiting for her he drew her out into the
dark lobby and said how does it sound
darling

  i dont know tip wtiat do you
think

  i think id be willing to gamble any-
thing to get money and presents and things
to give you tip said quietly

  nora squeezed his hand not for that
alone tip you want to get ahead you
always would why dont you take a
chance

  i am he folded her in his arms and
kissed her and it was so strange that nora
almost protested then smiled and tip
vanished up the stairs back in the dining
room macmahon and bledsoe were taking
leave of fitz they were going to go down
to the store to assemble tips outfit

major fitz beckoned to nora and
she came back to the table sit
down he said i want to talk to you   
have i been drinking too much or did
i see that young scalawag kiss you nora
you did nora admitted blushing i
like him major fitz

  hmm so do i but i dont kiss him
  i mean i like him awfully well
  better than johnny
king colt



  nora looked him steadily in the eye
better than johnny she said quietly
its-its just that tip is steadier and
more considerate than johnny

  remember johnny was an orphan
raised in a rough town and with rough
people nora fitz pointed out gently

  nora patted his hand she could not help
but compare major fitzs tolerance and
justice to johnnys hot-headedness and his
quick anger here while johnny was hunt-
ing ways to prove major fitz a crook
fitz was pleading johnnys case with her
and a deep wave of bitterness passed
through her whatever doubts she had had
as to preferring tip to johnny-and they
were few and dim she thought-were van-
ished now she felt anger toward johnny
and pity and quiet affection for this loyal
man across from her

  i understand all that major fitz but
it isnt as if i liked a man for his man-
ners or for his polish

  i know that you like me fitz said
and smiled a little and im just a rough-
neck

  and i was raised on a ranch nora
said maybe i wouldnt know good man-
ners if i saw them

  nonsense youre a lady because you
cant help it

  nora squeezed his hand and there were
almost tears in her eyes dont be hard on
me old friend im just trying to do what
i think is best

  i know you are they are both fine
boys he shook his head slowly i
wouldnt undertake to say which youd
be the happiest with nora-if you can be
happy with any of us men tip is steady
maybe a little bit dull and johnny is wild
and a hellion but more to my taste but
youre the one thats choosing you stick
to what you like and you-

  fitz stopped speaking and his eyes
shuttled quickly to the lamp overhead its
flame was guttering as if a sudden draft
had struck it

  and then explosively major fitz
shoved hard on the table so that it

slammed against nora and carried her over
backwards to the floor he dodged aside
snaking out of the chair just as the blast
of a shotgun filled the room with terrible
noise

  major fitz lying on the floor whipped
a hand to his shoulder holster flicked out
his gun and in one snap shot at the lamp
overhead plunged the room in darkness

  then on his knees he swiveled his gun
to one of the back windows and emptied it
in thundering peroration filling the room
with the savage hammering of his gun-
fire

  when the gun was empty he paused
and waited there was no movement not
a sound from that partially opened win-
dow

  fitz pulled himself slowly to his feet
his knees were shaky and he was
angry at himself for the sickness deep
in his belly that he recognized as
fear

  nora fitz whispered are you
hurt

  im all right nora said weakly wthat
happened

  fitz walked over to her and lifted her
to her feet in the darkness if theyd hit
you id never have forgiven myself

  but who was it

  i dont know fitz answered simply
evidently i have my enemies like every
other man

  the dining room door opened and the
clerk came running in with a lamp by its
light fitz looked at the table its cloth
was tattered its top channeled with the
blast of buckshot and the lines it had
drilled in the table top told their own story
by shoving the table against nora and up-
setting her fitz had saved her from taking
the full charge of the buckshot in her body

  she looked at him her eyes still wild
with fright and he folded her in his arms
trying to quiet her hysterical sobs while
the clerk looked on in bewildered silence

  and looking at that scarred table top
major fitz knew that leach wigran had
taken up the gauntlet

samaritan

by

     kenneth l
      sinclair

the weather was thickening
fast skookum bad news
that to any bristol bay
skipper but to kindly ken-
nards way of thinking even a
williwaw was only a minor irrita-
tion when stacked up against the
presence of the togiaks owner
aboard

  in the estimation of many a
seagoin man an owner is a
sort of two-legged monster who
crouches in a warm office some-
where ashore navigates a swivel chair with
the greatest of skill and pours endless
clouds of cigar smoke from his funnel an
ideal owner is one seldom seen and even
less often heard

  but oscar pattler was far from being an
ideal owner pudgy pompous he kept
thrusting his sharp little jib into matters
that were none of his proper business and
as any alaska man knows a bristol bay
skipper has a tough enough proposition on
his hands without having owner trouble
added to his worries on these treacherous
shoaling shores lie the bleaching bones of
many a fine ship-and many a seagoing
mans career

  right now though in spite of the howl-
ing gale pattler was coming up the iron
ladder to the tugs little bridge he barged
into the wheelhouse without so much as
a by-your-leave

  kennard what do you think youre
doin now the little owner shrilled shak-
ing the seas honest spray from his coat

whyd you slack speed and swing off
your course

  calmly the skipper put the helm over
a bit more peered through the rain-swept
windows as the togiak swung some-
bodys piled up on that shoal off cape
chichagof he stated hes making dis-
tress signals-hear that foghorn

  pattler snorted youve cost me enough
with your yen for rescuing people this is
a tugboat business-and from now on
youre letting the coast guard take care
of those fools that get themselves into
trouble the sharp-nosed owner squinted
through the windows thats a tugboat
he yelled must be burkun man
kennard grinned nodded yeah its
his boat

   pattler lifted himself on tiptoe and yelled
up at the lank calm master now you
listen kennard ive stood enough youve
lost time and money by chasing into the
craziest places risked my vessel and my
business to pull blundering fools off the
sea-goin samaritan



rocks youve wasted my oil-you went
out to seal island in a howling williwaw
to pick up a flyer who landed in the water
you yanked a fisheries department boat
off protection point last fall in ice that
strained the togiaks frames so bad that i
had to send you clear down to ketchikan
to have her hauled out and repaired
youve pulled so many rescues that theyre
callin you the seagoin samaritan an im
tellin you right now-orderin you-to let
burkan set he got himself into this-
it happens to be the law of the sea to
help those in distress kennard stated
pointedly competitors not excepted
pattler bristled im the owner of this
boat and im ordering you to take no
more chances with her right now we got
a tow waiting for us at egegik and were
goin in after it on this high tide youll
do as i tell you or ill put you on the
beach without a job so quick youll wonder
what hit you

   im the master of this vessel kennard
stated at sea im the boss burkuns
broadside-to on that shoal in this blow
thats making hell pound to pieces in a
few hours so im going after him now
if youll get off my bridge mr pattler  

  pattlers sharp little jaw sagged he
pulled a noisy breath between his teeth
rose on the balls of his feet to yell an an-
swer and then suddenly closed his mouth
with a click and backed out of the wheel-
house kennard was calm and kindly in
manner-but years of battling the sea in
treacherous aleutian waters and in equally
dangerous bristol bay had given him hard-
ness and force

kennard eased the togiak carefully
toward the shoal now as he came
nearer to it he could see that burkuns red
bacharoj was rolling heavily under the im-
pacts of the howling combers which were
going right over her a man was clinging
to the stricken tugs bridge frantically
waving what seemed to be a red undershirt
from the giant build of him the man
would be blaze burkun himself and
kennards lips moved in a grin

  burkun on the shoal burkun the up-
start who had given boasting unwanted
advice to almost every skipper on the bay
burkun who freely admitted that after
four months experience he knew every-
thing there was to know about these waters

  for kennard there was a smile in this
but there was some mighty ticklish work
ahead too he knew these waters as well as
he knew the back of his own right hand-
knew just how close he could approach this
shoal in safety but in this thick weather
he couldnt see cape chichagof and so he
had no guide to his position none that is
except burkuns squat red tugboat which
naturally showed the location of the shoal
upon which it was grounded

  true enough kennard had charts and
the usual pilot books and he knew just
how reticent they were in describing this
shoal the pilot book had it this way a
dangerous obstruction is reported to exist
about four miles off cape chichagof
nothing more than that and chart 
confined itself to an indefinite x fol-
lowed by one of those position doubtful
notations that many a seaman has had rea-
son to curse

  no help there nothing to do but depend
upon the becharof for a marker approach
as closely as possible then come about and
try to hold position and float a line down-
wind to burkun it was quite possible that
before the tide fell the togiaks powerful
diesels could pull burkun off the sandy
shoal

  kennard rang the engineer vince waldo
for full speed and got set to bring the tug
about and then with the smoke of her
engines flung low over her stubby bows by
the gale the togiak struck

   turning as she struck the tug heeled far
over to port the sand laid hold of her keel
and brought her to a wrenching groaning
stop pattler on the foredeck went asprawl
and rolled into the scuppers and when he
bounded back to his feet he was yelling
like mad

  kennard rang full astern he got it
promptly-but it was no use with her own
speed and the thrust of the storm to drive


argosy

her onto the shoal the togiak was hung
up for sure-and on a falling tide at that

  with a cold gleam in his eyes kennard
flipped the engine-room telegraph to fin-
ished with engines lashed the wheel to
keep the rudder from banging itself loose
and went out onto the little bridge

  blaze burkuns huge figure was plain to
be seen now on the becharojs bridge the
mans red thatch was being whipped by the
gale and he was grinning with triumph
the becharojs foghorn was stopped
now and burkuns stentorian yell rose
above the hollow crashing of the breaking
seas

  whats the matter samaritan i
thought you knowed these waters how
come you grounded

  scum kennard retorted whats the
idea of faking distress

  why whaddayuh mean burkun
yelled innocently wre jus dropped the
hooks for a little rest thats all no law
against that we anchored fore-an-aft
because were tough babies an like tuh roll
our foghorn stuck-maybe well fix it at
egegik an i was shakin my laundry out
in the wind cant hang a man for that
can yuh burkun pulled his greasy sea
cap over his touseled red hair tilted it to
a cocky angle and grinned wickedly

  well he went on we gotta be goin
now kennard i guess you wont be able
to handle that cannery tow now that youre
roostin on the shoal well jus sort of
pinch-hit for yuh 

  a couple of burkuns men started the
fore and aft winches and lifted the hooks
which had held the becharoj in position
behind the shoal smoke spurted from the
crafts rust-eaten funnel burkun let loose
a series of derisive toots with his whistle
as he swung away and headed toward
egegik

vince waldo came out of his en-
gine-room just as kennard reached the
deck waldo was a frail-looking precise
man addicted to stiff white collars and a
scholarly manner not a man made to the
mold of an engineer a good many would

say-and right there theyd be wrong
waldo kept his diesels unning like jeweled
watches and his engine-room was cleaner
than most galleys

  were on chichagof shoal kennard
informed him

  then pattler elbowed waldo aside
why didnt you look where you were go-
ing the owner demanded with a lands-
mans disregard of the simple facts of
seamanship why didnt you look down
into the water-see how deep it was why
didnt you take soundings why couldnt
you tell by the breakers that-

  burkun put one over on me kennard
admitted as dirty a trick as i ever heard
of too i took it for granted that he was
on the shoal-broadside-to as he was he
sure made the thing look real i didnt think
that with burkuns tub marking the shoal
for us there was any need for the lead-
and short-handed as you keep us there was
nobody aboard to use it anyway and this
water is so murky with volcanic ash that
you cant see a foot down and if youll
take a look around youll see that in this
shallow water the breakers extend for miles
satisfied

  satisfied pattler yelled with my
boat aground and burkun going in to
egegik to grab our tow- satisfied bur-
kun put it over on you all right all he
had to do was play on your fool yen for
rescuing people if we ever get outta this
im goin straight to the marshal at pawik
ill see burkun behind bars before im
through with him

  not likely mister kennard stated
burkuns lied himself out of worse deals
than this one and hes got a crew of ac-
complished liars with him on that tub to
back his yarn

   that put pattler back a notch for a mo-
ment his sharp-fronted mouth kept open-
ing and closing like that of a fish out of
water kennard could well understand
pattlers rage for years pattler had en-
joyed a monopoly in the towboat business
on the bay but now burkun had horned in
-and with both his pride and his profits
caught in the squeeze pattler was wild
sea-goin samaritan



  well anyway ill settle your hash for
you he shrilled kennard ill put you
on the beach and ill see that you stay
there now work this boat offa here use
your engine wiggle back an forth or some-
thing 

  kennard gave the owner a frosty smile
this mister is a boat and a boat doesnt
answer her helm unless shes going ahead
and to run the engines forward would just
drive us harder onto the shoal weve got
to sit here until a higher tide comes along
-or until somebody gives us some help
our job now is to keep the ship from
breaking up

  a vicious sea slammed against the tug
with an impact that wrenched a groan out
of her and flung spray high into the air
pattler slammed against the deckhouse by
the murky water came up gasping weakly
call for help somehow he ordered

  that said kennard will be easy
well just send a message to the coast
guard with that radio transmitter that you
never bought us

  quivering pattler retreated aft toward
his cabin

  kennard watched him go

  vince waldo looked very solemn i told
you splinterpuss would bring us bad luck
when he came aboard i worked it out by
numbers-

  come on aft kennard interrupted

  on the tugs broad fan-tail deluged by
spray and buffeted by the gale the skipper
and the engineer made things fast as best
they could nothing much we can do
vince kennard said the old togmks
due to take a beating but she can take it
while burkuns tub would fall apart keep
a close watch below though if we start
taking water let me know

  and when we get off waldo asked
primly what do we do to burkun

  the engineers gentle manner might have
fooled those who did not know him into
overlooking the hard and joyous gleam
which lurked behind his gold-rimmed
glasses

  kennard gave the engineer a slow grin
well see vince

pattler spent the afternoon in his
cabin locked in with his worries and
his profit-ledgers he emerged along about
sundown cornered kennard in the fore-
peak and went at the skipper like an ex-
cited little terrier

  kennard now you lissen to me- ive
been figurin up the losses youve caused
me by your fool rescue acts an- hey
there goes burkun-with our tow
pattler was right for once in the murky
gray mixture of sea and sky a man could
just make out the  ton cannery ship
with burkuns squat tug wallowing ahead
of it this was one of the off-years when
the egegik salmon run dropped to zero-
and the cannery people were anxious to get
their vessel an old bark which had been
converted to a floating cannery to work
on the nushagak bay run as soon as possi-
ble knowing kennard for a towboat man
who knew his business they had given the
job to the togiak but when burkun
showed up with word that kennard was in
trouble it was only natural for them to
give the becharoj the nod a salmon run
waits for no man

  vince waldo came out of the engine-
room companion i been listening to my
short-wave radio the prim little engineer
reported the egegik cannery station sent
a call to the coast guard told em we
were hung up on this shoal 

  kennard clenched his fists this was a
sock on the jaw and no mistake word
would go the rounds that kennard had to
be pulled off a shoal by the coast guard
and the towage business from then on
would go to the competitor who knew these
treacherous waters and their currents well
enough to keep himself-and the tows
placed in his charge-out of trouble mean-
ing burkun

  blaze didnt know bristol bay nearly so
well as he pretended but he did make a
lot of noise and hed make a mighty good
thing out of this

   pattler realized all this too and without
a word now the owner went stamping back
to his cabin and there he stayed until the
togiak was pulled off the shoal just after


argosy

dark by a coast guarder who bellowed
questions through a megaphone and got
some very unsatisfactory answers

  free of the reef kennard headed the
powerful tug northeast by east driven by
the steady pulse of her diesels the togiak
smashed along belligerently shouldering
through the seas there was something
mighty businesslike about the tug and
there was an unwavering purpose in the
eyes of her skipper as he peered through
the rain-lashed windows of the wheelhouse

  after a while vince waldo came up with
a tray of food that he had prepared the
togiak far under-manned because extra
hands cost money which pattler couldnt
bear to subtract from his profit column
had no cook

  kennard gave the engineer the wheel
put the tray on the chart-table and con-
sulted page  of his pilot book while
he munched absently

  on his face there was a shadowy smile
when he took over the wheel again and
let waldo go below to the engines

after hours of zigzagging in the
nasty cross-sea born of a conflict be-
tween storm and tide kennard picked up
the lights of the becharof and her tow
against the northwesterly blow burkun
was making scant headway

  and as he passed close-to kennard
blinked his lights in mocking salute

  from that moment on in the wheel-
house of the staggering plunging togiak
the skipper was mighty busy he fought
the wheel consulted charts  and 
kept minute track of his position and
speed and made allowances for the tide-
current and the drift caused by the gale

  the sea wenched at the tug as if de-
termined to tear the keel out of her out-
side the little wheelhouse there was only
the blackness of night crammed with the
roar and the crashing of the water inside
kennards face wore an expression of
frosty amusement as gently he altered
the course a bit to port

  after a few minutes he lashed the wheel
and went out onto the little bridge and

clung there looking back toward the dimly-
seen lights of burkuns tug burkun was
swinging to follow the togiak burkun
who made a lot of noise about knowing
these water intimately was relying on ken-
nards judgment now that the going was
tough

  the master of the togiak altered his
course a trifle more then held to it the
seas suddenly became more savage took
on a suspicious resemblance to breakers
but soon however they slacked off and
the motion of the togiak eased

  kennard went out onto the bridge again
it was hard now to make out the dim
lights of the becharof and its tow but
after a few minutes kennard perceived
burkuns lights brighten in intensity
while those of the cannery hulk gradually
disappeared

  kennard returned to his wheel and rang
waldo for half speed

  after fifteen minutes or so burkuns
squat tug drew alongside hauling danger-
ously close to the togiak burkun let loose
a series of frantic toots with his whistle

  kennard rang his engines to stop-
stand by and went out onto the bridge
again across the narrow strip of water
which separated the two plunging rolling
tugs he looked down at burkuns giant
figure on the becharofs deck plain against
the vessels lights

  whatll you have kennard asked
camly leaning against the rusty iron-pipe
railing of his bridge

  yuh know well what ill have burkun
roared you led us across a shoal the
cannery hulks aground-our line carried
away the hulkll bust up any minute an
you gotta help us get her off bfore she
does you got a line heavy enough-

  you think the pounding we took on
chichagof shoal did us any good ken-
nard retorted we strained some frames
bent our rudder and had some ports stove
in you got us into that with as low a
trick as ever was pulled by anything on
two legs then you went off and left us
now im heading for dillingham-and if
i choose to take a short-cut through shal-
sea-goin samaritan



low water thats my business im sure
surprised that a man who claims to know
as much about these waters as you do
should have to follow someone else in thick
weather

  burkun shook spray from his eyes and
glared up at kennard with the malevolence
of a cornered kodiak bear you aint
gettin away with this he roared that
cannery hulks worth a couple hundred
thousand with the machinery thats in her
you knew she drawed more water than
either your tug or mine-you knew shed
strike on that shoal everybody knows
youre one of them wise guys that uses
charts an such an keeps track of his po-
sition all the time you went an deliber-
ately led me-

  youll never make that stick ken-
nard cut in your tow is your responsi-
bility not mine you knew how much
water she draws why didnt you use your
lead

  i did it showed eleven fathom a min-
ute before the hulk struck i seen some
breakers but by then it was too late

  well kennard said easily looking
over the men who crowded the becharofs
deck behind burkun your tow is roost-
ing on ustiugof shoal if youll look at a
chart some time youll see that ustiugof
has two fathoms at mean lower low water
which is just about the stage now and if
youll look at a pilot book youll find it
says ustiugof is steep on the offshore side
-i see youve taken off the crew of the
hulk well- kennard turned opened the
door of his wheelhouse and started to go
inside

  hey burkuns bull voice was as near
to pleading as he could bring it this
is a case of distress see do i get some
help or dont i

  why kennard said-grinning when
he saw that pattler had come pussyfoot-
ing out onto the deck and was listening
intently-sure you do blaze always glad
to help a man out

  burkuns heavy jaw sagged pattlers
head swiveled and his sharp face pointed
up at the skipper

   kennard went back into his wheelhouse
and rang for half-speed the togiak got
under way

  and with the storm lashing at their
broad fan-tails and the smoke of their
diesels swirling low over their bows the
two tugs raced back to the stranded tow

the cannery people had done wrong
by the susan m-any seagoing man
would tell you that profanely the old
barks proud masts had been stubbed her
hold crammed with iron chinks dehydra-
tors and steam chests to make her a float-
ing salmon cannery

   and now she lay heavily on the shoal
her stubbed bowsprit pointed defiantly
into the storm

  kennard eased the togiak close past
the bark and the becharof followed closely

   ill send a man or two aboard  burkun
megaphoned to kennard well haveta
use your line

   kennard agreed to that burkun sidled
close to the togiak close enough for two
of his hands to jump across to kennards
vessel and bent a light line onto the end
of his galvanized wire-rope tow cable
that was the only cable of its kind on
bristol bay burkun used manila line and
pattler if a man could judge from the
way he was stamping around on the fore-
deck of the togiak down there didnt like
this idea of helping burkun not any

   but it wasnt pattlers way to do his
objecting now hed wait until burkun
wasnt around-not good business to let
the competition know that there was dis-
sension aboard the togiak

  burkuns two men returned to the
becharof carrying with them their light
line burkun swung the red tug away and
sidled it up to the cannery bark his men
made the precarious jump to the low plat-
form that had been built out fromthe
barks hull to serve as a landing-stage for
the aleut fishermens small boats from
there aided by the glare of the searchlight
beam which burkun threw against the
bark they made their way easily to the
deck


argosy

   with the help of their light line they
drew kennards steel towing-line aboard
made it fast to the bits at the barks stern
then they signaled with a flashlight

   burkun responded to the signal with a
blast of his whistle swung back to the
togiak and had a man throw a short
manila line across the togiaks bow patt-
ler made the line fast the other end of
it was fast to the winches on the beckarofs
fan-tail so that burkuns craft could add
its pull to that of the togiak

   then with diesels snorting and lines
creaking the two tugs threw their stub-
born might against the sands grip on the
cannery hulks keel

   for several minutes nothing happened
but then kennard felt the bark stir felt
her come reluctantly free

   he grinned in the dim glow of his bin-
nacle had burkun been a better seaman
he would have waited for the rising tide
and the storm to help him rather than
chase frantically after the togiak for as-
sistance but it was just as well that he
had done it this way this way a neat
share of the towage fee would go to patt-
ler and perhaps then the owner of the
togiak would come down off his high-horse
for a while

   for himself kennard would be willing
to let it go at that fighting bristol bay
was job enough for a man-and kennard
liked to be at peace with his fellow men
competitors not excepted

the susan m was running free now
and one of burkuns hands came aft
on the becharof and cut the manila line
which had coupled the two tugs together
burkun let go a series of blasts with his
whistle

   and as if in answer the togiak bounded
forward the laboring beat of her diesels
lifted running free she smashed wildly
through the seas until kennard rang down
the engines and darted out onto his little
bridge to look back

   it wasnt hard to see what had happened
those burkun men who were aboard the
bark had cut kennards steel tow-cablel

  and now burkuns squat tug was
circling grazing past the bow of the bark
his men had broken out another line
aboard the cannery vessel-were throwing
it down to his tug

  by the time kennard had circled to
come alongside the becharof they had the
line fast and burkuns craft was swinging
the tow getting under way

  the sky was lightening some now and
kennard as he ranged close could see
burkuns gleeful face on the becharofs
bridge

   whatll yuh have kennard the red-
headed giant hooted

   kennard went out onto his own bridge
whats the idea trying to gyp us out
of our share of the tow we pulled the
bark off that shoal for you and if you
think-

   dont know what youre talkin about 
burkun taunted i aint seen yuh since
you was roostin on chichagof

   you fool those cannery workers youve
got aboard there will testify-

  now aint that too bad burkun re-
torted accidental-like they went an got
intuh my private stock of fire-water
theyve passed out on me to a man
kennard moved with an odd stiff care-
fulness as he lashed his wheel and went
down to the togiaks deck vince waldo
was sticking his head out of the engine-
room pattler his sharp face white under
the dripping brim of his hat was pacing
the deck

  the togiak though running at slow
speed was drawing away from burkuns
craft burkun yelled hey kennard-
want tuh come over an argue

  kennard looked speculatively at the
choice collection of bruisers who crowded
the becharofs deck vince waldo lugging
a huge wrench came scurrying forward
anything you say skipper-

   no pattler interrupted well put
this thing before the commissioner at dill-
ingham well-

  thatll buy you nothing kennard
stated burkuns all set to lie himself
out of this-beat us out of our claim he
sea-goin samaritan



fed those cannery men some of that de-
horn he peddles to the indians so theyll
be no help to us a man has to have proof

  pattler said well were not going to
get our heads smashed start for dilling-
ham-and when we get there youre fired
twice in one day you let that red devil put
it over on you seagoin samaritan- the
little owner swelled up phooey he
snorted

  vince waldo squinted up at the skipper
what say kindly

  not a word vince it wont be words
that will settle this thing

the togiak lay peacefully at anchor
in the nushagak river just off dilling-
ham in his cabin kindly kennard was
busy with the melancholy task of packing
his duffle

  not an easy job this a man becomes
attached to a ship which has gamely seen
him through as many adventures as are
inevitable in four years of bristol bay
tow-boating and though a tug may be a
blunt and unlovely specimen of sea-craft
she has a persistent individuality which no
other type of vessel can equal

  vince waldo stuck his head into the
skippers cabin kennard swung around
saw that the engineer had his own sea-bag
slung over one shoulder

  now look here vince the skipper
began just because im canned-

  im sick of this tub anyway the prim
little engineer retorted sick of pattler
im-

  youre a poor liar kennard retorted
youd leave those engines of yours just
because i pulled one rescue too many
youre a fool

  they were still arguing that point when
they reached the deck but their argument
stopped when they saw a gas-boat carry-
ing the u s commissioner and pattler
come threading through the maze of indian
outboard boats which were plying nets on
the river

  pattler was white quivering with help-
less fury

  burkuns brought the cannery hulk to

anchor off nushagak he said wildly ges-
turing when he reached the tugs deck
the commissioner staged a hearing-
burkuns gang of thugs lied their heads
off the commissioner says ive got no
proof-cant do a thing do you realize
what this means to my business if i cant
get the goods on burkun hes set to get
ail the towing business-

  too bad kennard sympathized

  too bad is it pattler yelled how
about the investment ive got tied up here
what am i gonna do about that what
about the guff ive had to take from that
red devil

  i wouldnt know kennard said gently
i dont work here any more im just
waiting to go ashore and having helped
myself out of a job ive sworn off helping
other folks

  pattler squinted kennard what are
you so all-fired cagey about

  the skipper moved toward the rail
business is business you said so your-
self so im keeping what i know to my-
self from now on maybe the commissioner
will give vince and me a ride to dilling-
ham

  but pattler grabbed kennards jacket
listen kennard whatve you got up
your sleeve can you prove-

  i might prove that we pulled burkuns
tow off a shoal last night but-

  how pattler yelled how cn you
prove that

  that kennard stated calmly is my
own business now if you want me to work
for you again well talk business but its
going to cost you ten bucks a month extra
on my pay for every time you told me i
was fired-about six times i think or sixty
dollars

  pattlers mouth sagged open closed with
a click sagged again at last he managed
to wheeze all right-if you prove it
and if you dont ill see that you never
get a job so help me

the commissioners boat carrying
pattler and kennard and vince waldo
now in addition to the commissioner


argosy

crossed the broad reach of the river and
came alongside the cannery hulk the four
went aboard

  they were met by burkun the giant
glared at them and spread his feet de-
fiantly you guys whinin around here
again

  kennard grinned like to have a look
at those stern towing bits blaze if you
dont mind

  burkuns bushy red eyebrows lowered
suspiciously but then he pulled air into
his barrel chest and let out a derisive snort
go ahead if you think you cn make
anybody believe that yarn of yours go
to it trouble with you guys is you got
grounded on chichagof shoal lost a towin
job-an now youre tryin tuh get even

  he followed them aft though and he
scowled when kennard knelt at the towing-
bits

  burkun had of course removed the end
of the togiaks cable from the bits
but kennard pointed to the weathered
wood

  there you are commissioner this
hulk hasnt been moved for years-and
ours is the only steel-cable towing line of
its particular size on bristol bay burkuns
manila line would never have bit into the

wood as our line did our steel line left
its fingerprints here so to speak and you
can check them any time with a section
of our cable which proves burkun was
lying and when the hearing about a cer-
tain dirty deal that was pulled on chicha-
gof shoal comes up the fact that burkun
lied about this wont help him any will
it

  pattler chuckled as pleased as a little
boy but burkun let out a roar of fury
he crouched with his nostrils flaring

  smiling vince waldo drew a big wrench
out of his pocket take it easy burkun
the red-headed giant blinked looked
from wraldo to the commissioner and then
back to kennard awright he grumbled
but you guys got nothin on me see
you cant-

  if you come out of this with your ticket
still in its frame ill sure be surprised
kennard said mister pattler shall we go
back to our vessel

  kennard the sharp-nosed little owner
complained what with that extra pay
youre makin me kick in youll damn
soon be part owner of the boat

  not a bad idea kennard commented
grinning id say its a good way of
handling an owner who wont stay ashore 
mutiny seizes us this morning

	unrest has us in its grip its
probably merely a symptom of
delayed spring fever but we are conscious
of accelerated mutations of a sense of life
rushing giddily ahead without much direc-
tion but with a great speed and gusto on
our own private and figurative merry-go-
round there is no reward but the exhilara-
tion of the ride-not even a brass ring
and we are content that this be so

  it is a dangerous mood prompting us
to inaugurate all sorts of changes to fill
wastebaskets with those perfectly useless
scraps of hieroglyphic-covered notepaper
that have been kicking around our desk
to rip pages off calendars even to wince
at the sight of a face familiar to us for
more than a day or two and to abandon
old philosophies with shattering reckless-
ness we knew perfectly well that we must
sternly hold ourselves in check any im-
pulse obeyed today will be regretted for-
ever after our only hope of muddling
through this treacherous seizure is to sit
perfectly still and say nothing whatever
to anyone repression is the keynote

  be that as it may our comparatively
antic frame of mind leaves us wide open
for the kind of letter that popped at us
out of the mailbag the very first thing
all you have to do to get your letter in
featured position apparently is to guess
in advance what weird frame of mind the
editor is going to be in when he opens it
simple really

robert essig

  may i dare say i hope to be different can
i dart from the beaten path like a tangent

  first of all-i have not read the akgosy for
twenty thirty or-alas not even forty years
hardly i say for this is the first copy ive

ever read i havent sailed on your brilliantly
golden ship before it was merged with all-story
and i didnt live throughout the war for it you
see my dear editor i am young yes painfully
so perhaps my ears need a toweling and i
can use a razor blade almost a month without
changing

  i like the argonotes more than most of the
stories i think they are very hypocritical and
sycophantish i pride myself on my ability to
be fourth dimensional and read between those
so well known lines

  needless to say i do like your stories they
are different and what excitement they do
carry-certainly not harmful to my so innocent
ears

  gbless you

  pottstown penna

thanks mr essig for falling in so
beautifully with our mood there was
a place though in your third paragraph
where we werent exactly sure of your in-
tention you like the argonotes better than
the stories-but when you say they are
very hypocritical and sycophantish do
you mean the argonotes or the stories
and if the argonotes are you being slight-
ly ironic or do you really like things be-
cause they are hypocritical and syco-
phantish or what exactly were not
trying to be picky but you do leave us
deep in a fine mist of bewilderment

t scott offutt jr

  i	was delighted to see that illustrious ex-
ponent of the formula yarn-mr lester dent-
appear in your pages i have followed his doc
savage with much pleasure and consider deni
a veritable one-man factory

  also delighted to see my old friend joe
townsley rogers appear see if you cant per-
suade him to tackle a novel in the fine frenzj
of hurly-burly that characterized once in a
red moon but possibly too many years ol
the blue pencil have sobered his diction

  to you and to preceding editors-congratu-
lations i doubt if theres a pulp in existence




argosy

which can claim as many devoted followers and
i attribute that to a most gifted and aggressive
line of editors i wont pick favorites-all your
writers are a-l and i notice that not only
have a host of your contributors graduated to
the slicks but that a few appear simultaneously
in the argosy and the slicks to-day

  im collecting argosies and would like to
contact any readers willing to part with old
ones-the older the better

  towson maryland

just to reassure mr offutt we hasten
to say that the work of joel towns-
ley rogers and the editorial blue pencil
are almost utter strangers in fact mr
rogers blissfully untrammeled condition
on our pages is practically an office scan-
dal

  for weeks weve been howling for let-
ters from new or newish argosy read-
ers so when we find them somewhat less
restful than the roseate reminiscences from
old-time argonauts its probably nobodys
fault but our own anyhow mr offutt
wants more rogers while the next gentle-
man wants a good deal less of him and
apparently none at all of jtrs contro-
versial colleague theodore roscoe

john e potter

  i am a rather new argosy fan ive always
liked your magazine but until recently felt
satisfied with any pulp of the higher class for
several months now ive been sticking to
argosy and am very well satisfied except for
your pet theodore roscoe whose stories i am
astonished to see included with those of brand
challis and bedford-jones roscoes characters
lurch about the stage with aching muscles and
tortured lungs until my tongue hangs out and
sweat beads my brow i read for pleasure so
i must skip roscoe who leaves me exhausted

  but my purpose in writing is to cheer your
magazine each issue brings me new thrills
new glimpses of far off lands and ancient times
the farther back you go the better i like it

i hereby order some crusaders phoenicians
norsemen and romans i am yours unless you
find too many roscoes and townsley rogers

  darien conn

its been a pretty much stag affair so
far today so immediately to the south
youll find two members of the distaff side
in full cry first an elusive correspondent

who gives us no clue to identity except in

the superscription

from the hills o maine

  have been reading numerous references to
republishing some of your older stories in an
argosy quarterly fine idea but when do you
begin may i mention a few i should enjoy
again the black butterfly a semi-dual story
which first attracted my attention over  years
ago-all your semi-duals are worth repeating
the argus pheasant that interesting story of
borneo and the dutch east indies the master
of the hour by achmed abdullah the story of
the man who would be ruler of all africa
the three hostages a fine detective story
how often i have recalled it by the cryptic
meaning of on the side of jordan in the
green fields of eden-remember it the moon
pool and its sequel both by a merritt were
eerie enough for anyone that winter of 
and  was full of splendid stories the ship
of ishtar was another good one these in my
opinion are much preferable to some of your
recent gangster stories madame storey-whats
become of her gillian hazeltine was always
good and burroughs has always delighted boys

  why not print stories of aneient egypt
babylon the gobi desert and persia  even
historical novels or novelets are better than
gangster stories i skip the latter-but have
always enjoyed argosy a good interesting
magazine is to be enjoyed during the long win-
ters ive tried many but like best the argosy
because it is different

mrs harry w walker

  the argosy has a new cover long live the
argosy

  we did not begin with the early readers of
the argosy we began with the cavalier de-
cember  later on the cavalier was mar-
ried to all-story and later all-story became
the argosy

  we liked the early stories so much that we
have home-bound copies of george allan eng-
lands trilogy-darkness and dawn beyond the
great oblivion and the afterglozv also jacob
fishers cradle of the deep-august -
and wm brown meloneys golden gate pub-
lished in december 

  we like nearly all the stories but do not
miss any

  we would like to see more semi-dual tales
also madam storey jimmie cordie and the
mr solomon stories the fantastics scientific
or futuristic are our particular favorites but
we read them all

  so i say good luck and you have our wishes
for a long and prosperous run

argonotes



for many months we have been aware
of the fact that the one thing which
argosy does not need is a poets corner
why should we clutter our pages with non-
sensical jingles who gives a hoot about
moons in june and goons in tune nobody
of course a fig for that would be the viva-
voce vote of our argonote legions

  therefore with the fine logic for which
we are truly infamous we herewith inaugu-
rate our poets corner

  this sub-department we are certain
will loom large in the literary history of
this century we plan to conduct it under
rules which are most unique it will ap-
pear for example only at such obscure
times as we happen to be in the mood for
it we shall pay not one penny for contri-
butions in fact each contribution must
be accompanied by a penny or an unrea-
sonable facsimile thereof all professional
and all amateur poets are barred not one
word do we want from edna st vincent

millay or robert frost hush all you ed-
gar guests only the editors and authors
of argosy plus bonafide argonotes stal-
warts are eligible to this holy of holies
in certain moods we will bar all poems
that rhyme in others we will reject all
verse except that of most intricate rhym-
ing

we inaugurate our epoch-making revo-
lutionary super-streamlined innovation to
wit and as follows

 a-
after

athletes

    foot

       iwkmj according to the govern-
       nient health bulletin no
       mw e- at least  of the
       adult population of the
       - j united states are being
       jf attacked by the disease
       w known as athletes foot

       w usually the disease starts be-
       r tween the toes little watery
       blisters form and the skin
       cracks and peels after a while
       the itching becomes intense and
       you feel as though you would like
       to scratch off all the skin

w the germ that causes the disease is known
v as tinea trichophyton it buries itself deep in
r the tissues of the skin and is very hard to kill

   a test made shows it takes  minutes of boiling
  to kill the germ so you can see why the ordi-
  nary remedies are unsuccessful

  h f was developed solely for the purpose of
treating athletes foot it is a liquid that pene-
trates and dries quickly you just paint the af-
fected parts it peels off the tissues of the skin
where the germ breeds

beware of
it spreading

  often the disease travels all over the bottom of the
feet the soles of your feet become red and swollen
the skin also cracks and peels and the itching be-
comes worse and worse

  get rid of this disease as quickly as possible be-
cause it is very contagious and it may go to your
hands or even to the under arm or crotch of the legs

  most people who have athletes foot have tried all
kinds of remedies to cure it without success ordi-
nary germicides antiseptics salve or ointments
seldom do any good

  as soon as you apply h f you will find that the
itching is immediately relieved you should paint
the infected parts with h f night and morning
until your feet are well usually this takes from
three to ten days although in severe cases it may
take longer or in mild cases less time

 h f will leave the skin soft and smooth you
will marvel at the quick way it brings you relief
especially if you are one of those who have tried
for years to get rid of athletes foot without
success
