         know two cousins whose names might be
joan and elsie their incomes are equal
both have long been accustomed to the best that life
affords- bur joan s hats which cost all the way from
nothing to five dollars apiece are always as smart as
elsies at twenty-five dollars joans complexion
smooth and pink as peach blossoms happens to cost
her only a few cents a week whereas elsie positively
refuses to tell how many dollars she spends on beauty-
treatments lotions creams and imported soaps

  joans soap for instance is just as fine just as pure
just as gentle as ekies costly treasures white too
moreover-joan prefers a white soap because she con-

siders it daintier and because it leaves no colored stains
on her washstand

  yet this smartly-turned-out soap of hers in its crisp
blue wrapping is just as distinctive as her quite sophis-
ticated five-dollar hats and it costs the enormous sum
of five cents

  its name guest ivory white pure gentle honest
as ivory has been for nearly half a century and-with
its delicate modeling its smoothly-rounded edges its
rich cleansing lather-fit for a princess

  joan always buys three cakes of guest ivory at a
time so as to have a fresh cake on hand whenever a
princess arrives unexpectedly

barbary blood

by george e holt

from a dinner table fate pitched brandon grey chief of the sultans secret
service into an adventure on which hung the throne of morocco-and in which
cold steel or a swift bullet was the penalty for failure

chapter i

i prove game

he key of chance un-
locks the door of ad-
venture i had left
new york city for a
conference in singa-
pore with benjamin
lownde s of the
lowndes concessions
ltd at gibraltar i learned that as the re-
sult of blood poisoning induced by the bite
of a tiny red spider the plans which had
been formulating between the englishman
and me would never come to a head ben-
jamin lowndes was dead

  upon the heels of this news a cablegram
flashed across the straits from morocco a
message from my old friend and sometime
fellow-adventurer brandon grey suggest-
ing i come over

  you might find it interesting the wire
ended

  interesting

  wherefore on a certain june evening
instead of being on shipboard bound for
singapore i was plunged abruptly into
the whirlpool of violence and intrigue
which swirled beneath the lazy oriental
life of the land of the moors

  are you game brandon grey had
asked ajid to that challenge there was
of course but one answer

  i had been no more than six hours in
tangier before  had begun to feel a cer-
tain tension from the atmosphere which
hung about brandon grey it had begun
when we had clasped hands on the wooden
pier and had looked into each others eyes
i realized at that moment that grey was
no longer the careless adventurer i had
known in years gone by who had faced
with me the assegais of meneliks war-
tnit

frontier stories

riors in abyssinia and the multiple dan-
gers of india and thibet i suspected that
he had become a man with a purpose
there was beneath the gay smile and ban-
tering tone of the pal of former days a
solidity of which words and smile and
laughter were only ganneuts of conceal-
ment

  more and more i felt this as the hours
passed during which we sat at ease in the
patio of his house and chatted about past
adventures but what his new purpose in
life might be he did not then divulge and
i did not press for information he was
one in whom i had entire confidence-
through strenuous experience

  but when in the evening i sat down at
his dining table as one of four guests 
was convinced that his mission was deeply
concerned with moroccan affairs which
are always dangerous

  morocco offered adventures offered
danger offered high achievement even to
a foreigner an american i knew the
country somewhat having lived there once
for a year or more but grey knew it in-
timately so intimately that he spoke cas-
ually of matters strange to me

  the other three guests at his dining ta-
ble were native gentlemen arrayed in the
white swathing robes of formality dark
eyed dark bearded and except for one
fair skinned this one was brown skin-
ned and yet with no trace in his features
of the negroid mixture of the two white
moors i need say nothing further they
were high officials from the office of the
sultans representative in tangier friends
it seemed of brandon grey they talked
of everything except politics but the
third man sidi achmed lahya spoke lit-
tle and when he did speak referred al-
most invariably to the disturbed condition
of the country to the efforts being made
by france and germany to seize control
and to oust the reigning sultan or to the
attempts of unpatriotic moors to create
rebellion and to place another sultan upon
the throne

  we had gotten i judged almost through
the somewhat elaborate meal when a ser-
vant entered and whispered something to
brandon grey excusing himself our
host rose and left the room in a moment
he returned to the doorway and beckoned
me to him

  are you he asked when i reached
him game for a night ride-and probably
a fight

  i told him that i was if it was not too
long a ride nor too big a fight i was

rather soft for the last few years my
exercise and my adventures had been few
and far between

  he nodded and smiled left me standing
there while he spoke to his guests explain-
ing as i understood that he had been ur-
gently summoned to the home of a friend
who had been taken ill he begged them
to make themselves comfortable and com-
mand the servants as though they were in
their own homes

losing the door upon
them brandon grey
hurried me to his sleep-
ing quarters from a
bureau drawer he took
hea-y automatic pistols
with holsters and belts
he handed one to me
and strapped the other around his waist
handed me clips of cartridges

  but look here brandon i said
arent we going to change clothes these
things- the idea of going into a fight
in evening dress struck me as grotesque

  not a moment to cliange old man he
flashed back at me lets go

  where i managed to ask as i fol-
lowed him

  tell you on the way he said lets
get going

  we reached the cobbled patio into which
at that moment a native groom led two
saddled horses i was relieved to note that
they bore texas saddles were powerful
beasts brandon grey beat me to sad-
dle but not much he swung his horse
toward the gate and i followed

  in the open road which ran past the
house and from which the courtyard
opened a lantern gleamed in the hands of
another groom and by its feeble lights i
perceived brown robed bare legged native
horsemen and although i could not see
their faces because the hoods of their
djellabas were dropped i could see those
points on the left shoulders which tell
clearly as words that rifles are slung across
the backs of the riders under their gar-
ments 

  ride commanded grey and galloped
off

  as i followed i could not help smiling
at the picture or rather at the two pic-
tures of brandon grey and myself for i
knew that my own aspect resembled that
of the figure ahead of me-a man in eve-
ning clothes the trousers already crawling
up the legs and revealing the white of an
undergarment the feet in patent leather
barbary blood



pumps thrust into wooden stirrups the
silly short dinner jacket blowing back the
glazed white shirt bosotn and high collar
gleaming phosphorescently in the starlight
and panama hat topping it all followed by
a similar apparition who in turn had at his
heels galloping brown shrouded native
mountaineers with their ritles across their
backs and the lord only knew what inten-
tions in their hearts

  now knowing something of the tangier
district it was not long before i became
surprised at the route we were following
we had skirted the main part of town
and had reached the beach which here
curves around tangier bay for a dozen
miles but in the middle of the crescent is
the river halle a tidal river while we
had been skirting the town i had been sure
that we must be headed for one of the two
only roads out of town that is the fez
road which runs south or the tetuan
road which runs east we passed the fez
road however and i decided it was to be
tetuan but in turn we passed the tetuan
road and reached the beach and started for
the halk river as we were crossing the
sand dunes which lie above the beach i
became conscious of a peculiar warm wind
coming from the east with almost every
leap of my horse it seemed to increase in
strength by the time we had reached the
beach it had grown stiff was throwing up
whitecaps in the bay the mutter of which
reached my ears

  once upon the beach there was no need
longer to ride in single file i spurred my
horse and overtook brandon grey by
the time i had done so we had covered an
arc of the beach crescent bringing the
wind more into our faces i felt the
sharp sting of beach sand it liad picked up

  shurgy  i shouted as i raced along-
side of brandon grey he did not an-
swer we raced on curving along the
beach more and more the wind in our
faces now it was a gale upon it came
not only blinding sand but little pebbles
which cut there was a booming across
the bay the waves broke angrily our
horses shook their heads in the fusillade of
pebbles i drew my hat down over ray
eyes to protect them

  where i shouted are we going
not i admit that it made very much dif-
ference but i knew this there was no road
off the beach between where we were and
the halk river nor was there anything be-
tween where we were and the river except
beach and sand dunes manifestly then

    awhrcfftr

we were heading for the halk river-and
i noted that the tide was in

  to anghera brandon grey shouted
back at me his voice came unevenly the
wind seemed to twist it to tear the words
to pieces i caught two more words
wait-river-

  we raced on the pressure of the wind
grew greater and greater i felt myself
pushed backward in the saddle by its force
it became a miniature sandstorm my
eyes my nose my mouth were full of
sand my face and hands and wrists
burned with the sting of pebbles even
through my clothing i could feel their im-
pact and my horse felt them too now
and then he would swerve abruptly and
snort angrily thus like devils unchained
we galloped through that constantly in-
creasing hail of sand that constantly hard-
ening wail of wind until abruptly i almost
crashed into brandon grey who drew his
horse to his haunches on the bank of the
river halk he turned as i reached him

  now where i shouted ill swear
he grinned

  is this anghera he shouted

  i knew it wasnt of course i knew that
anghera lay on the other side of the
river

  brandon grey drew his horse nearer to
me

  we are going he shouted-i knew he
was shouting although his voice was little
louder than a whisper in the bellow of the
wind and the hiss of the sand-we are go-
ing to the village of el-menar where i
hope to capture a man i want you said
you were game

  i looked at the disturbed water of the
river which it was his apparent intention
to cross

 i am i declared and i almost
added but this is a hell of a night for a
party how come i added as an after-
thought you want a man

  all proper he said i hereby depu-
tize you secret service of the sultan
lets go

  he spurred his horse into the water was
immediately up to his knees in the stream
i followed after watching him a moment
and when i felt the presence of the three
native riders behind me waiting for me to
move the water reached my knees i
saw that it was up to brandon greys sad-
dle i laughed at the picture we must have
made then two gentlemen in evening
dress in texas saddles in the middle of the
halk river in a sandstorm the river
was deepest on the side we had entered


frontier stories

brandon grey began to emerge trom the
water i felt it receding down my legs
the horses snorted and splashed i cast a
look behind me and saw the nearest native
riding with a rifle held over his head in one
hand and his djellaba pulled up around his
shoulders by the other he waved his gun
at me and shouted words which the wind
swept away from me

  shortly  heard the hoofs of brandon
greys horse thudding on solid ground and
my own beast lurched up the river bank
we raced away again over the beach until
we were within perhaps a mile of the little
round tower torre blanquillo which
squats sentinel-like upon a point overlook-
ing the bay there we turned sharply to-
ward the hills and in a few moments had
left the roar of the shurgy and the bom-
bardment of the sand and pebbles behind us

chapter ii

belabbas makes a dash

dont know just
where we were joined
by other riders sud-
denly i perceived that
our group of five had
been augmented t o
twice that number i
did not see them but i
could feel their presence could hear the
increased thudding of horses hoofs the
increased clanking of metal accoutrements
the increased creaking of leather and i
knew that the rifles had now been unslung
from brown backs and were carried across
the saddle bows

  we mounted the western slope of the
hills and tumbled down into the valley be-
yond at this moment the first rays of
the moon began to throw their silver light
into the valley we topped the elevation in
the east beyond which i knew lay the
village of el-menar our destination

  as we crossed the valley  could see that
my perception of the increase in the num-
ber of our followers had been correct
the rocky path of the hills gave way in
the valley to silent earth ve crossed with
little noise and drew to a halt within the
shadow of the somewhat precipitous east-
ern hills there brandon grey halted
swung from his saddle and gave the order
to dismount one of the natives seized
the bridle reins of his horse and my own
and led them to where the horses of the
other riders were being picketed

on foot from here brands grey told

me and as we waited apparently un-
til the horses should all be properly se-
cured he explained a little further

  this man belabbas he told me who
i understand is lying in hiding tonight in
el-menar is a bad egg a son-of-a-gun
its my job to catch him because as i told
you i am of the sultans secret service
more than that amigo im the head of it
but dont pass tliat word on and this
belabbas has a cute little game by which
he hopes to put upon the throne in place of
the present sultan a fellow who is known
as mulai mohammed mulai mohammed
claims to be the elder brother of the sul-
tan and the rightful heir to the throne
he isnt and my job is to protect the
present monarch mulai abd-el-aziz this
man belabbas is engineering the thing for
mulai mohammed he is here in the
north now trying to stir up anghera and
the rest of the district i have been watch-
ing some of his agents in tangier  have
had my own spies out and one of them
brought the news that belabbas was in el-
menar he may be

  he wont be taken  suggested with-
out a fight naturally

  i dont think that he has any of his
own followers with him answered grey
if he is in el-menar it means that he has
converted the village to his way of think-
ing and is relying upon the e-menaris
for protection there wont be more than
forty or fifty men to contend with the
surprise attack is the equal of treble
forces

  all is ready sidi a native announced
in a husky voice

  mzien answered grey let us go
lead the way idrees

  the native barefooted now i observed
started off up the hill at a smart pace
brandon grey followed and i followed
him we went very quietly following the
well marked path and as i was walking
almost in the footsteps of my fellow-coun-
tryman the road needed little of my at-
tention i had time to think

  it was rather amazing to find myself
here bent upon such a mission at noon
of this day i had been in very much civil-
ized and very much governed gibraltar
where people did only the things that they
were permitted to do day by day in ac-
cordance with the official government bulle-
tin now at moonrise of this sameday i
was climbing across an african hill be-
hind the chief of the sultans secret ser-
vice and a file of dark faced berber fight-
ing men all of us intent upon raiding a
barbary blood



native village and carrying off from its
protection a man who plotted the creation
of a new sultan

  within the next hour other strange
things would happen some of these feet
which now toiled up the hill might not go
down the hill again the rifles upon these
brown backs behind me would speak and
would be answered by other rifles and per-
haps on one of the shrieking bullets my
own name would be written in an hour
perhaps history would be written for i
could easily perceive through my knowl-
edge of the temperament of the moroccan
people that belabbas in death or captivity
might eliminate a real menace to the throne
that belabbas at liberty might reorganize
the empire for the hold of the present
sultan upon his people was not strong

  but strangest of all it seemed to me
was that my old friend brandon grey
should be the man to hold the fate of em-
pire in his hands again i had to smile
at the mental picture of this ambassador
of fate with the water of the wad-el-halk
dripping from his shapeless trousers and
mingling with the yellow dust of the an-
ghera hills making his way insouciantly in
a boiled shirt to attack a native village
and wrest from half a hundred fighting
men the person of as grey had put it that
son-of-a-gun belabbas

  i have found that adventure always
comes in smiling guise never as a terri-
fying phantom one goes singing a little
trick of fate and the dark wings are heard
above they pass and one goes again upon
ones way singing and i have noted too
that those who seek for adventure are those
who find the least of it whereas those who
want none of it upon them is it thrust by
perverse destiny truly as i have writ-
ten at the start of my narrative it is the
key of chance that opens the door to ad-
venture-the key of chance and never the
jimmy of intention

  we camethen to the top of the hill and
halted i perceived that a sort of plateau
or mesa spread before us and that at a
distance which i judged to be less than a
quarter of a mile a single yellow light
shone about it was a sort of silver sheen
which i knew to be caused by the moon-
light shining upon the great flat cactus
leaves of the wall which surrounds almost
every native village

  the moonlight was unfortunate for us
but this evil was overcome by the fact that
upon our right was a chain of minor hills
and at the foot of this ran a shallow can-
yon

  the native addressed by brandon grey
as idrees called attention to this gully and
to the fact that it ran from where we had
halted to a point far beyond the village of
el-menar all we had to do to escape the
revealing moonlight was to reach this gully
and then to follow it to our destination

  we did this idrees in the lead i was
amazed at the silence with which we trav-
eled until i realized that the natives had
removed their slippers and were carrying
them on their backs in the hoods of their
djellabas the only sound seemed to come
from the contact upon the stones of the
gully of the evening slippers worn by
brandon grey and myself and before
we reached the village i reflected grimly
we would both be as barefooted as those 
brown men who followed us

  the wind was from the east so that our
little noise was held back from the village
and more important still our scent was not
carried to the noses of the village dogs

he yellow light drew
closer and closer we
drew near enough to
see that it was a lantern
hanging on a post at the
entrance to rhe village
passed it and halted
v again now brandon
grey took the lead from idrees gave a
brief command to follow and climbing out
of the gully led swiftly toward the gate
where hung the light i followed gained
his side noted that he had drawn his pis-
tol and drew mine

  there is only one gate of course he
flung at me as we strode along wre
reached the gate

  two men on guard here snapped
greyr the others come with me

  now a dog barked and another dog and
a dozen voices called there was the
sound of movement within the dozen
thatched roof huts ranged around a central
opening sort of a public square necessar-
ily small because the entire village was
contained within walls of cactus which did
not enclose more than three or four acres
of land

  grey led swiftly to the center of this
opening a match flared in his hand and
i saw him applying it to a thing that re-
minded me of a roman candle such as we
use on the fourth of july the thing
sputtered and bending over grey thrust ii
into the ground suddenly it burst forth
in a glaring blue light which illuminated
the village from end to end as this liht
frontier stories

burst forth the man idrees shouted an or-
der and the dozen natives formed a hollow
square facing toward the four sides of the
village thus every house and whoever
came from them was under the sights of
their rihes

  it requires no effort of the imagination
to conceive tliat the simple natives of el-
menar must have been startled half out of
their wits by the sudden glare which
flooded the village and which must have
penetrated many a crack and cranny of
their houses with its ghastly light nor
that when tumbling out of bed to seek the
cause of this magical illumination they
should sec against the infernal glare the
black silhouettes of the riflemen facing
them wherever they might be doors
were thrown open and half clad village men
stood in the doorways blinking and open
mouthed here and there a wide eyed wo-
man peered over her mans shoulder and
then ducked back with a shriek children
began to cry and the multitude of village
dogs apparently startled into a momentary
silence voiced their objections

  to the headmans house brandon
grey called over his shoulder to idrees

  this house easily distinguishable be-
cause it was a little larger than the others
and had a little more space about it stood
on the east side of the square we went
swiftly toward it but before brandon
greys upraised pistol muzzle had time to
fall upon the door it was opened and a big
brown man stood scowling at us a man
becomes headman because he is less easily
disturbed or because he has quicker per-
ceptions than the others djellali this
headman must have observed us from
within the house now he addressed us
hoarsely

  who are you and what do you want
he demanded

  brandon grey lowered the pistol until
it covered the headman

  who i am does not matter snapped
grey what i want does matter i
want your guest beabbas

  it must have seemed strange to djellali
to have a foreigner in evening dress
backed by fireworks demanding the per-
son of belabbas in very forcible and cor-
rect arabic his scowl deepened

  you are a dog of a christian he said
go away

  those men whom you see there with
rifles are not dogs of christians returned
grey nor are the bullets in their guns
christians	i

  in whose name growled djellali do

you thus descend upon my village at night
with armed men 

   in the name djellali answered grey
of his majesty the sultan-and the pis-
tol you perceive in my hand bring forth
belabbas

  who is this belabbas that you talk
about belabbas-belabbas-i know no
belabbas

  ignore the name then demanded
grey but bring forth your guest

   i have no guest denied djellali
come forward then that i may en-
ter said grey

   the big fellow looked from greys eyes
to the pistol to me to idrees standing with
rifle ready beside me

  as you wish he said then and took
one step forward

  guard him idrees ordered grey

and be-

  just what happened in the next thirty
seconds it is hard to tell in that length of
time i think that djellali swept his huge
arms together throwing grey and me
against each other and then against idrees
i know there was a breath in which i felt
myself thrown into contact with others in
which i inadvertently pulled the trigger of
my automatic i know that from the dark-
ness of the doorway behind djellali there
leaped a man clad only in shirt and draw-
ers who as he leaped thrust djellali up
against us again djellali recoiled and
threw himself backward into his house as
grey fired toward the fugitive

  belabbas shouted grey he moved
his pistol a little-cursed and lowered the
gun for belabbas had done an unlooked
for thing he had dashed straight toward
the muzzles of the rifles of the men held
upon him from the hollow square in which
the light still flared quick witted he was
apparently for in keeping in a line be-
tween us and the riflemen he rendered it
impossible for either side to fire at him
we could not shoot because had we
missed we should assuredly have struck
the men forming the square and they in
turn did not dare to fire upon liim because
we were directly in their line of fire
i almost before i had fully comprehended
the strategy of his action i saw two rifles
raised in the air like clubs and then saw
the two holders of the rifles go spinning as
belabbas dashed between them and the
next thing i saw was belabbas tooping in
his run to pick up the blazing torch in the
center of the square holding it aloft for a
moment while lie grinned about him he
had reason to grin because in the center of
barbarv blood

ihat square he was again perfectly safe
from the rifles which surrounded him
then he thrust the lighted end of the
torch against the ground and darkness
came like a thunderclap upon the village

chapter iii
the black magician

n the sudden dark-
ness doubly dense be-
cause of the vast bril-
liance of the flare the
man we sought made
his escape the ex-
planation of the guards
we had left at the gate
was that they had been staring at the light
and that when it ceased to be they were
suddenly smitten blind so blind that they
could not even perceive the light of the lan-
tern near them let alone the figure of the
being which they heard rush past them
brandon grey was more philosophical
about belabbas escape from his hands than
i had expected he would be

  elsewhere if not here he said shrug-
ging his shoulders either at nashipur
or babylon he paraphrased

  this was after lanterns had been brought
and our riflemen stationed around the
headmans house of which grey had taken
possession

  with that he dismissed the matter and
turned his attention to the headman djel-
lali who was lying groaning upon his pal-
let with one hand clutching a brown leg-
through which a bullet-my own i judged
-had passed

  my friend stared coldly for a little while
at the groaning man who avoided return-
ing the look then he called idrees and
commanded that three riflemen be brought
in they crowded through the door al-
most before the order was given

  now commanded grey stand that
man up against the wall

  obediently idrees bent over djellali
seized the big man by the arm and com-
manded him to stand for a moment it
looked as though the headman was going to
put up a fight but after he had looked
into the cold eyes of brandon grey and at
the three rifles which were now leveled at
him he rose with a grunt and idrees
slioved him back against the wall the
riflemen understanding raised their rifles
the hammers clicked as they were pulled
back by brown thumbs

now a mohammedan does not fear
death especially at the hands of a chris-



tian because paradise awaits him but
wirhout fearing death he may greatly crave
life in other words if death must be
met let it be met without fear but if it
does not have to be met so much the bet-
ter i observed that brandon grey un-
derstood this difference this trick of the
native mind because he did not threaten
djellali with death but spoke to him of
the pleasure of living of eating and drink-
ing and breathing and watching his chil-
dren grow up and tilling his farm- and
hunting and the undoubted opportunity of
gaining more and more favor in the eyes
of allah by acts of grace in short by
emphasizing life he put a terrible emphasis
upon death and so at last it was djel-
lali who asked brandon grey what he
wanted instead of brandon grey demand-
ing a thing from djellali

  a trifle of information answered
grey one word which you know from
belabbas one word only in exchange for
all the pleasure of living

  and that word djellali looked now
at grey puzzlement crinkling his brow
and forehead

  the name of the place where the one
called mulai mohammed lies in hiding

  djellali stared defiantly valiantly in si-
lence but he lowered his eyes at last

  i am of course aware that belabbas
had told you grey said in reply to that
movement

  but djellali shook his head trying to
raise his eyes again to meet greys stare
and failing stared at the ground

  well it is too bad brandon grey
murmured because in that case- ab-
ruptly a childish voice cried out in the
doorway and a little boy of perhaps five
years owlish eyed under the hood of a little
white djcuaba pushed past the riflemen
ran to djellali and seized the big mans
hand

  what are you doing father he asked

  the eyes of djellali looked down into
the eyes of the boy his face hardened with
resolution then softened with something
else he flung back his head returned
brandon greys look

  arzila he muttered

  brandon grey nodded and with a motion
of his hand sent the riflemen away

  you are wise djellali he told the
headman wise because you at last came
to see that the child there is more impor-
tant than the aspirations of mulai moham-
med his voice grew sterner but do
not shelter belabbas again-nor any other
of his kind
io

frontier stories

  that is understood sidi said djellali
nevertheless i do believe that mulai mo-
hammed should be sultan

  the opinion hurts no one grey told
him think as you will-but do not shel-
ter traitors he turned looked at me
and we went outside idrees stood by the
doorway awaiting orders

  your house idrees is it not near the
fez gate in tangier grey asked the na-
tive

  yes sidi responded idrees

  summon your men then and let us
ride for there at once and swiftly

he shurgy had died
down somewhat and it
was now at our backs
so that the ride back to
tangier was made more
swiftly and with less
discomfort also the
river was lower now so
that we did not get so wet and so within
an hour we drew rein at a little isolated
house in the suani south of tangier
where idrees lived our riflemen sought
rest in a big courtyard idrees threw open
the door of the house and bade us enter
and then excused himself to go and see
what food was available i took advan-
tage of this opportunity to question grey

  what now i asked

  not that i didnt think i knew i judged
that we would have some refreshment and
a little rest at idrees then return to greys
house on the marshan probably on the
morrow i reflected my friend would start
out for arzila forty miles down the coast
and that i should probably ride with him
but he had a different idea

  why he said as soon as we have
something to eat and attend to another
little matter or two we shall start for ar-
zila

  a forty-mile ride at night-after our
ride to el-menar and back

  you are joking i said although i
knew he was not

  not on your life the chances are that
belabbas is already  his way-or rather
that he will be on his way as soon as he can
walk in from anghcra and get a horse
and i propose to reach there first not only
to prevent him from warning mulai mo-
hammed but to try again to catch him

  but i objected would he believe that
djellali would divulge mulai mohammeds
hiding place that seemed to me im-
probable

  he might not think he would an-

swered grey but he might fear he would
at any rate that would be the only thing
he would have to fear

  i dont think myself tkat djellali
would have told you if the child had not
entered when he did

  nor i agreed grey sheer luck
again i thought the key of chance had
opened another door

  and so we ride to arzila-now-and
in these clothes

  brandon grey laughed as he surveyed
my bedraggled figure and no doubt woe-
begone face

  not so he answered in half an
hour two beggars with ragged djellabas
will be on their way to arzila those
beggars will be philip dale and brandon
grey

  matters eventuated as he had said we
ate of idrees kesksoo and baked chicken
and luscious grapes drank many cupfuls
of sweet tea and then discarding the gar-
ments of super-civilization donned beg-
gars rags dirt from the roadway on our
hands and arms and faces ashes from the
fire-pots rubbed into our tousled hair
filthy bandages w-rapped around his neck
and both my forearms dilapidated slippers
upon our feet we looked like two rem-
nants of misery

  why i asked don these things here
why not wait until we get to arzila
one can ride as well in these as in
any other garments grey explained
moreover we must pass on foot through
the city horses will be waiting for us on
the other side

  and so it came about that we were
passed through the eastern gate by a night
watchman who grumbled at being aroused
by a couple of beggars but who let us
through nevertheless and we took up our
journey through the sleeping city

  just after we passed the mosque of
hulai hassan brandon grey pointed to a
barred and shuttered window in the sec-
ond story of a house upon our right hand

  that he said is where lives the
famous el habib the black magician
master of innumerable djinns quite a
character he chuckled

  as if in answer to his whispered words
as we reached a door set deeply into the
wall of the house he had pointed out the
door opened and the moonlight fell upon
a vast figure standing on the threshold
a vast black figure of a sudanese negro
swathed in black garments his chin and
forehead and cheeks and nose seemed of
silver where the moonlight struck them
barbary blood

  here a moment beggars he said
softly i have alms for you

  it struck me that this was not so good
and that grey would probably ignore the
summons wherefore i shuffled steadily
along the cobbles until my companion stop-
ped me with a hand upon my arm and
pulled me toward the doorway

  you are dumb say nothing he
whispered under his breath and then in
arabic he whined in the voice of the beg-
gar the world over alms sidi alms in
the name of allah the compassionate
and went up to the big negro i tagging
at his heels he thrust out a dirty paw
and repeated his solicitation

  i was watching the magician i saw the
moonlight shatter on his face as it wrinkled
into a grin showing his white teeth the
change startled me but even more start-
ling was the deep guffaw of laughter which
followed the grin

  so so he said having rid himself
of the guffaw so we have two beggars
who are going on a journey a long jour-
ney as far i think as-let us say-ar-
zila  my knees nearly let me drop but
grey was of sterner stuff

  alms sidi he whined alms i
had to admire his nerve and while doing
so realized that i was standing with open
mouth staring at the black magician as at
a ghost

  yes he continued to arzila i think
good and instead of alms i will give
you something worth more than alms yes
assuredly worth more than many alms i
mean advice and that advice is to take
note of the fifth house on the right hand
side of the street beyond the tangier gate
of arzila he guffawed again then
quieted as suddenly as he had laughed
and he went on being a magician
naturally i make charms of value i have
one for you it is better than alms

  into brandon greys still outstretched
hand he laid what appeared to be a little
square of folded paper bent the fingers
over to hold it

  this charm he said may bring good
fortune to two beggars in arzila guard
it and go your way with allah he
stepped back drew the door half closed
but wait i have forgotten to say-
there was a chuckle in his voice-i have
forgotten to tell you that that charm al-
though it is good against all evil should
be particularly good against- i heard
the concluding phrase through the swiftly
narrowing opening of the door-against
one calling himself mulai mohammed

  the door closed a bolt grated bran-
don grey looked at me and i looked at
brandon grey

  hmph uttered brandon grey

  it seemed to me that that did not cover
the situation

chapter iv

by the tangier gate

he uncanny knowledge
and mysterious words
of the black magician
were a jolt to grey i
think even more than
to me my astonish-
ment was due chiefly to
the mans apparent
knowledge of our mission to his weird
recognition of us in our beggars rags to
the fact that he appeared to have been
waiting in the doorway for us to pass in
short i was aghast that anyone should
have possessed such knowledge as he
seemed to possess that he had secured
it through magic and djinns i was almost
ready to believe

  the effect however upon grey-i had
to judge this from his occasional mutter-
ings addressed not to-me but to himself-
seemed to be different apparently he saw
behind the black magicians operations
something bigger than i was able to per-
ceive and when in a sheltering nook
he paused to light a match and inspect the
charm which el habib had given him i
was disappointed at what he did not say
he held the match and folded paper so i
might see-and all i saw was a tangle of
arabesque lines shaped roughly like an out-
spread hand-and then grunted something
unintelligible and started off

  nevertheless el habib did not change
our plans we found idrees waiting with
horses as he had been instructed and
morning found us squatting upon the cob-
bles at the side of the street just within the
tangier gate of arzila we had dis-
mounted before daybreak outside the walls
and idrees had led our horses to the south-
ern gate where upon its opening he was
to enter and put the beasts into some con-
venient fonda or caravanserai and when
the gate had been opened by the city guard
we had made our way through in a group
of countrymen gathered to attend market-
day and had taken up our seat by the side
of the road to raise our voices now and
then in a duet of alarbi-alarbi alms
-alms and to watch for belabbas

  i had visited arzila once some years


frontier stories

before and had thought then what a mag-
nificent sanctuary it would be for a bandit
gang or as the headquarters for a revolu-
tion it is a walled town several square
miles of massed buildings surrounded by
red sandstone walls fifty feet high in some
places and almost as thick these walls
 knew were honeycombed with secret
passages and forgotten rooms which the
superstitious natives had sealed up and
forgotten because of their fear and belief
that evil spirits dwelt therein

  time was when a hundred thousand peo-
ple had their homes in arzila now i knew
the population to he not over two thousand
which meant of course that thousands
and thousands of the residences-each one
of which joined  to others so that the
whole town it might be said was almost
under one flat roof-were deserted and
falling into decay

  i had thought to myself when in arzila
before that an army could be hidden in the
ruins and another army in the secret cham-
bers of the great wall did fear of spirits
not deter them from opening the passage-
ways it occurred to me now as i squat-
ted there beside brandon grey almost un-
der the feet of passing pedestrians and
beasts of burden that men like belabbas
and mulai mohammed were far less super-
stitious than the common citizen and i
suspected that what i had thought of the
advantages of arzila for revolutionary
purposes had also occurred to others
wise men i have noticed control the ig-
norant because they lack superstition
which is to say conventions

  i	had not forgotten the admonition of
el habib not to ignore the fifth house
on the right hand side of the street inside
the gate wre were seated in front of the
third house on the left hand side where-
fore the house in question was plainly vis-
ible perhaps i should say that the fifth
door was plainly visible for that was the
only indication of an individual residence
existing independently behind the solid
wall of the street there happened to be no
irregularity of roof heights here to indicate
different buildings only the blank yellow
wall with iron studded doors set deeply into
it and an occasional foot-square airhole
up near the roof line what was be-
hind the wall which surrounded the fifth
door i could not guess no inspiration
came from its blank lace it looked just
like all the rest of the street in this veil-
ing of house faces as well as of womens
faces is one of the mysteries of morocco
the door while i watched did not open

nor did anyone even pause before it

  we had sat there i judge almost two
hours and belabbas had not come

  he must have beaten us muttered
grey leaning toward me this was the
first word he had uttered for an hour and
the second time only that he had spoken
since we had sat there apparently he
thought that i needed no instruction and it
did seeun obvious that when belabbas rode
through the gate the thing to do was to
follow him but as i say no belabbas
came and i was mentally agreeing with
greys words when casting another look
at the fifth door  saw the figure of an as-
ftari a native soldier leaning against it

  now askaris infest all the towns of
morocco they are no more uncommon
than policemen in an american town and
like policemen they have a right to lean
up against things as they are inclined
nevertheless i watched this fellow who
was quite typical of his caste he was
brown wore the red fez red coat and
baggy yellow pantaloons of the askaris
was bare legged with his feet in worn yel-
low slippers and he carried a rifle i
started to call greys attention to him
stopped because it seemed useless then
did so suddenly because the door had
opened a little ways and the askari had
slipped inside

  i saw him answered grey just as
he disappeared did you see his face
was it belabbas

  but i had to confess that on the preced-
ing night belabbas face had passed me too
rapidly in a scene of too much confusion
for me to take note of it except for the
fact that it bore if my impression was
correct a short but thick black beard

  the askari had a short beard i told
grey belabbas did also didnt he
yes answered grey there is no
question hut what belabbas would have ar-
rived by this time and no question but that
he would come therefore the askari i
think is belabbas let us go

chapter v

the fifth house

ltns for the lion a
snare for the birds
said grey we had
left the gate and the
fifth house behind us
had turned off the main
thoroughfare into a lit-

	e canyon-like side
street scarcely four feet wide and half
barbary blood



covered bv the second stories of houses
projecting over it had come to a door-
way which had opened almost instantly
upon receiving a repeated series of taps
from greys knuckles and had entered to
be greeted by an old white whiskered man-
servant who manifestly recognized my
friend in spite of his disguise this was
one of the houses which grey explained
later he kept in almost all the important
towns ready to receive him at any hour
and in any guise in which he might ap-
pear now he was engaged in changing
his clothes during which operation he
talked to me more than he had talked
since the beginning of our adventure

  yes he repeated guns for the lion
a snare for the birds in el-menar be-
labbas was a lion to be captured if possible
by force here he is a bird as is also
mulai mohammed his master to be
snared allah only knows the extent of
mulai mohammeds organization here the
number of his followers i have a sus-
picion true-enough of a suspicion to em-
phasize the need of guile instead of force
-although it is also true i might raise
some little force of my own in case of
need

  while he spoke we were exchanging the
rags we had worn for the uniforms of as-
karis government soldiers there was
this difference greys uniform was that
of captain of askaris whereas mine was
that of the common soldier

  this mulai mohammed he continued
who desires to become sultan is without
question not mulai mohammed at all who
he is i do not know-at least not definitely
but i do know that mulai mohammed in-
dubitably was executed five or six years
ago by the then regent for fomenting an
uprising

  how then i asked does this pre-
tender manage to get by  certainly there
must be many people who know mulai
mohammed

  he is clever answered grey he
uses two stunts to protect himself on this
point one is that his face is never seen
except i imagine by those who are his
chief co-plotters always when he appears
before his lesser followers or those whom
he would convert to his cause his face is
covered like a womans in this way he
keeps from being recognized as not being
mulai mohammed secondly as it must
be believed that he is mulai mohammed
despite the covering of his face he exposes
his breast and shows thereupon a strange
birthmark which it is common knowledge

defaced the breast of mtilai mohammed
faked of course but it serves its pur-
pose well it is a birthmark about the size
of a childs hand and so shaped

  like the shape of the charm the black
magician- i began

  grey swung around to stare for a mo-
ment

  by george that hadnt struck me
he exclaimed now i wonder- he
continued his dressing

  but how is it i asked that if mulai
mohammed was executed this charlatan
can find people who believe him to be what
he claims

  easily enough in this country eas-
ily enough i dont know of a single pre-
tender who has been executed who has
not been followed by another pretender
claiming to be him take bu-hamed for
example he died at the point of a rifle
in the hands of the sultan himself never-
theless within six months a large num-
ber of people had been convinced either
that he had never been captured or that
the sultans bullet had not been fatal and
that he had managed to make his escape

  after all the moroccans are not very
much different from us americans phil
with us the newspapers and demagogues
tell us an untrue thing until we believe it
in this country pretenders and holy men
and plotters take advantage of the same
gullibility of the public mind and another
thing to be thought of is that it doesnt
really make any difference whether or not
a pretender actually is who he claims to
be so long as he is what he is namely a
leader of revolution against the sultan
the fact that a man must be a shareef a
member of the sultans family in order to
be eligible to the throne is the reason that
the pretenders appear as brothers or uncles
or other relatives of the reigning monarch
instead of under their own names

  we had finished donning our uniforms
now grey adjusted various details of
mine and then with a grin suggested that
i might like to know what the next step
was

  if it is the hcaven-borns wish i an-
swered adjusting the shoulder holster be-
neath my arm a little better

  it is then grey told me this i am
a captain of askaris supported by you we
shall now call at the fifth door on the right
hand side of the street of the tangier gate
and there in the name of the government
enter in search of an askari who has com-
mitted a crime and who i have reason to


frontier stories

believe has sought refuge within the
house

   belabbas i said nodding provid-
 ing he is still an askari

   it will at least gain us entrance-per-
 haps answered grey and if belabbas
 is there- he broke off but belabbas
 may not be by any means the biggest bird
 for our snare

   at this moment the old servant returned
 a rifle in one hand a saber in the other
 at greys motion he handed the rifle to
 me and fastened the sword around his mas-
 ters waist

  we marched forth i two paces behind
my captain and very quickly came to the
house of the fifth door

  upon this door was an iron knocker
which grey operated raising echoes within

  we waited no answer again he used
the iron ring and again we waited

   i hear slippers whispered grey and
 raised his voice open for the captain of
 askaris

  no answer now a little crowd had
begun to assemble

p e n again called
grey o r i summon
the populace to break
the door

   ay we will help you
 sidi kaid spoke up a
 brown farmer who by
 the assagai in the back
 of his camel-hair djcllaba was a berber
 mountaineer ready for a fight at any time
 on any side what has he done whom
 you seek

   grey took advantage of this inquiry i
 judge that he suspected as i did that there
 were listeners on the other side of the
 door

   i seek the arrest of an askari who has
 committed a crime and who has taken shel-
 ter here will you help me break down
 the door

  ay that we will sidi kaid that wc
will

   here are cobbles to beat upon it with

  i have a stout club here cried an-
other

  and then the door stopped by a chain
within opened some six inches an evil
brown pockmarked face peeked out

   what do you desire sidi  it asked

  entrance snapped brandon grey
shortly

  but for what purpose

  you have heard i seek an askari who
has hidden himself here open

  there is no askari here sidi kaid
said evil-face

  with a swift motion my friend seized
the rifle from my hand swung it overhead
and brought it down upon the chain
stretched from door to door-jamb it tore
out of the rotten wood the man behind
the dgor tried in vain to close the portal
but could not because the gun-stock pre-
vented we threw ourselves against the
door and forced it open the crowd be-
hind us set up a cheer grey closed the
door and bolted it we found ourselves in
a long dimly lighted hall at the end of
which a large light room was distinguish-
able grey handed the rifle back to me
with a motion to guard the man we drove
ahead of us and drew his saber we
heard a door slam as we strode toward the
room ahead there was nobody in the
room but two doorways opened from it
in one the door was open showing another
door at the end of a hall in the rear of the
house grey threw open the other door
it was unoccupied i looked about the
main room saw in front of one of the big
floor cushions a little table gaudily painted
on which lay paper bamboo pen and a bot-
tle of ink grey picked up a sheet of the
paper studied it

  mulai mohammed he said was here
i think here is a letter he might have
written his signature is not on it but
the ink is not yet dry it was not finished
let us try the other door

  even as we turned toward it a velvet
hanging on the side of the hall leading to
the door in question was thrown aside a
figure sprang into view threw open the
door and disappeared it was the man in
the askari costume

  we ran to the door tried to pull it open
could not do so a bolt on the other side
held it we were stopped brandon
grey growled and studied the door then
again took the rifle from my hands and
stepping back began to pump the heavy
bullets into the oak the gun was a -
 throwing a bullet which would stop a
lion before its attack a hole appeared in
the splintered oaken barrier brandon
grey returned the gun to me reached a
hand through the hole he had made and
pulled the bolt which held the door he
swung it open  a draught of cold damp air
struck us we passed through the door-
way and found ourselves in a stone walled
and stone roofed and stone paved passage-
way damp and fungus-grown

  we were inside the great wall of arzila
with its unknown secret corridors and hid-
barbary blood

t

den chambers the wall had swallowed
up belabbas and his master the false mu-
lai mohammed

  suddenly we were in darkness darkness
following a loud crash i turned to see
the light behind through the hole which my
rifle had splintered in the woodwork of
the door the door was closed i heard
a bolt thrown as i sprang toward it i
heard additional crashes against the door
realized that the man we had left in the
room was piling against it any object which
might prevent our opening it even though
we again used the rifle as a key but the
use of the rifle was unnecessary i re-
membered that the bolt on that side of the
door was located just below the hole we
had created i reached through it pulled
the bolt and threw mjself against the door
but there was no give to it grey came to
my aid but our shoulders were of no avail
and even as we pushed only managing to
move the door a little at the top that mo-
tion was stopped by a timber which was
thrown against the portal

  not only were belabbas and mulai mo-
hammed and the lord knew who else
within the city wall but we two were also
prisoners there without food without wa-
ter and without light

chapter vi

the cry in the dark

hat there was a way
out a way out which
the men we sought had
taken was clear but it
was equally clear that
we did not know that
way and that should
we happen to stumble
upon it we might find ourselves blocked
by barred and immovable doors it
seemed to me highly probable however
that if we wandered about in the darkness
we would become completely lost i could
not help thinking that if this happened our
world would never know of our fate

  it was true that many people had seen
us enter the house but it was probable
that yery few of them would await
our coming out and eventually those who
waited the longest would go on their way
either because their affairs pressed or be-
cause they feared that some event had oc-
curred within the house which might get
them into the hands of the law as witnesses
 could not help remembering the blank
dead look of the fifth door in the wall 

imagined it still turning that same cold
frown upon all passersby hiding what
went on behind it as a mask hides the
features of a chinese actor

  my thoughts had taken scarcely the time
of two breaths were interrupted by the
voice of grandon grey asking if i had
matches there was no need to look i
remembered that i had none i told him
so

  i have one only he told me i re-
membered to slip my match box into my
pocket but there is only one match in it
were out of luck that one we will have
to keep for an emergency now the prob-
lem is not to get lost is your memory
good

  i told him it was and asked why
because he explained we have got
to remember every turn and the number of
paces we take between each if we had a
light we could make note of them and it
would be simple but as it is we have to
remember them and if we want to re-
trace our steps we will have to remember
them backwards

  that will serve for a little while i
agreed but not for long an idea oc-
curred to me what say we find a w-ord
or phrase which will have the same num-
ber of letters as there are paces between
the turns words are more easily re-
membered than figures

  excellent approved grey we can
make up a sentence which will have some
meaning and thus easily remember it
lets start you trail your hand along
the left hand wall and i will follow the
right no telling on which side the turn
will be so we started counting paces to-
gether-one-two-three-

  we were i realized walking in a line
across the wall not following it longitud-
inally and therefore we could not take
many paces without finding a turn  as
we had counted nine my hand slipped from
the wall into space

  nine paces i repeated and heres
a turn is there one on that side

  grey proceeded a few steps and felt
around and said there was not

  a nine letter word or phrase then to
begin with he said i suggested the
word traveling

  correct endorsed grey and we
make a left turn therefore we have to
remember the words traveling left now
lets proceed

  following the same method we passed
down the longitudinal corridor until simul-
taneously the two of us said stop we
frontier stories

 

had gone forty paces and at the same time
had reached a cross passage

  a phrase of forty words or letters
then began grey-and fell silent with a
pressure on my arm which i understood
slight as the sound was i had heard it
also the sound of men breathing of
men trying to breathe noiselessly

  we stood it was clear at an intersec-
tion of a passageway which ran parallel to
the length of the wall and one which cut
across it so that on each side of us in the
lateral passageway was a short corridor
and in one of these corridors were human
beings belabbas the one calling himself
mulai mohammed-proably others but
the strange part of it was that because of
some peculiar acoustic property of the
passageway  could not determine on
which side of us they were the slight hiss
of breathing seemed to come from both
sides the same

  no doubt the men pursued knew that
we were only two there was no doubt in
my mind that they intended to attack but
from which direction standing there
with drawn pistol i seemed to hear their
breathing behind me and before me as well
as on either side it was confusing at
this moment greys lips approached my
ear  am going to use our only match
he whispered be ready and watch the
corridor on your left

  i heard the sound of a match striking
saw nothing in the corridor down which i
was looking and turned my head just as
greys pistol roared the two of us went
down in a heap beneath our assailants
vhose number i could not determine which
in fact i liad no time to think about my
pistol had been knocked from my hand as
i fell and i felt strong fingers seeking for
my neck

  i fought lack rolled over crawled a
ways with the man on my back twisted
again then i felt a hard lump beneath
my shoulder reached for it and clutched
my pistol the hands were now at my
throat it was difficult to breathe and i
realized that the man was much more
powerful than myself therefore with-
out any other movement i laid the barrel
of my pistol upon my neck pointing back-
ward and fired three shots as quickly as
i could pull the trigger the hands upon
my neck relaxed a great silence fell

  i scrambled to my feet and called to
grey no answer no motion no
sound i took a step and my foot came in
contact with a body i felt for its heart-
beat there was none but the man had

a beard and so was not brandon grey
probably he was the man i had shot

  i walked around in a circle as i thought
but there were no more bodies living or
dead i was alone in the passageway and
besides that i realized with a sickening
sensation that i was utterly lost as tu di-
rection i could determine the cross pass-
ageway all right but i would not be able
to tell which way we had come along the
main corridor what had become of grey
of our assailants the answer seemed ob-
vious the latter had taken grey dead
or alive into some other part of the great
wall

  i am not ashamed to admit that my knees
grew weak that i sat down upon the cold
damp stones and regretted that the key of
chance had ever opened for me this par-
ticular door of adventure death by hun-
ger or by thirst is bad enough when it oc-
curs in company with a fellow-being when
it occurs in such a place as permits one to
see the sun or the stars but to be buried
alive in a city wall to starve and thirst in
darkness and alone until death should re-
lieve ones sufferings was a thought which
sapped such little courage as i had better
the quick death which might be facing
brandon grey at the hands of his enemies
than this

  but after a little i rose and in sheer des-
peration started off leaving the question
of route in the hands of fate when i
had gone some thirty steps i knew that i
was in the longitudinal passageway but
did not know nor care whether it was
leading me back toward the house by the
tangier gate or away from it

  i continued on in utter blackness until
a sharp cry brought me to a sudden halt
the cry seemed to come from a little dis-
tance ahead of me but it was not a mans
cry it was the cry of a woman or a girl

  i went forward listening intently again
came the cry a cry of pain or fear this
time seemingly from the wall beside me
i passed my hands over the wall thinking
that possibly there was a door which i
could not see they came in contact with
a heavy wooden framework in which were
jagged projections of rusty metal at
first i thought i had found the door i had
visioned there but feeling over it a little
more i realized that it was a window once
protected by an iron grill which had rusted
away also i discovered that it was now
closed by wooden shutters which gave
slightly beneath the light pressure of my
fingers

  and now the ciy came again followed
barbary blood



by a womans frightened voice pleading in
spanish

  no cs vcrdad francisco no cs ver-
dad-it is not true francisco it is not
true i swear that it is not true do
not kill me francisco do not- the
words rose to another scream of terror
i pushed against the window shutters and
they gave beneath the pressure but no
light came through them and i realized that
a curtain or wall hanging concealed the old
window the womans scream had died
to a gurgle and i pictured unpleasant
things gun in hand i swung through the
window flung aside the curtain and stood
up within the room

girl with loosened
long black hair was
bent backward over a
mans knee liis fingers
were on her throat her
mouth was open and
her eyes were staring
the man was a span-
iard  dark villainous looking with a
blood-red sash around his waist

  he had not heard me did not know i
was there until the barrel of my pistol der
scended upon his head probably he did
not know i was there even then because he
fell unconscious to the floor the girl roll-
ing from his suddenly limp knee to lie be-
side him

  it was the work of a moment to unwrap
the long red sash from the spaniards waist
and to truss him up with it but by the
time i had done this the girl was on her
feet and i turned to meet her stare of
amazement-and something else-to see
her amazement turn to fear as she looked
upon the man who had tried to kill her
the look of fear turned to curiosity as she
asked in spanish holding her swollen
throat whence i had come

  in answer i pointed to the window
which was visible because the shutters had
remained open

  i entered senorita i told her in her
own language through a fortunate win-
dow a window fortunate i think for both
of s

  this reminded me that belabbas and his
men might still be in the passageway and
i went to the window closed the shutters
and sought for a lock there was none
so i let the curtain drop into place again
and turned back to the girl

  i thank you a thousand times senor
she began hesitantly but-but-

  i saw her eyes scrutinize me up and

down realized that i still appeared to be a
native askari and that for one of these
stupid fellows to rescue a woman from
danger was rightly a matter of surprise
not that they are cowardly but they have
a very deep-seated belief in tending to
their own affairs only and that allah with-
out their assistance will rescue from dan-
ger those whom he desires to be rescued

  while i was thinking thus i had time
to notice that the girl was strikingly hand-
some in a spanish way she was i
judged about eighteen years old an age
when a spanish woman is in full blossom
her long black hair fell disarrayed about
her shoulders and i noticed a perceptible
curl in it her eyes were as black as her
hair wrhich was utterly so her features
were well formed although unduly flushed
now by her recent experience and more
than this there was a look of intelligence
in her eyes which many a handsome span-
ish woman lacks

  i was in doubt as to my course of ac-
tion i realized that through the window
i had entered a house built up against the
city wall that i was out of that dread dark
dungeon but i had to go back in search
of brandon grey that had been my
thought before i had found the window
before i had heard the cry to get out of
the wall secure a lantern or candles and
go back in search of my friend but fate
had ordained that i should gain my free-
dom by passing through the quarrel of an-
other man and a woman of the man i
had made a mortal enemy or i did not
know spaniards of the woman--yes
that was true too-of the woman i had
made a mortal friend or i did not know
spanish women even though i was only
a moorish askarifilthy from the dirt of
the city wall clothes torn by the fight
therein even thus the woman looked upon
me with eyes of gratitude i sought her
eyes again to verify this and saw her star-
ing wide eyed not at my face but at my
shoulder

  you-you are white senor she said
and- her eyes searched my face now-
your face is not the face of an askari
the color stops at your neck

  i drew my blouse together understand-
ing then that in my struggle some of the
buttons had been torn off and thus the un-
stained flesh had been exposed  re-
solved then not to attempt to carry the de-
ceit further resolved to trust this wo-
man to have her aid me as every moment
was precious

  you are right senora i began

a


frontier stories

  senorita she corrected me senor-
ita mona valdez

  i did not reciprocate with my name i
bowed

   it is true i am no askari  i told her
thanking the gods that i knew spanish
what i am does not matter what does
matter is that a friend of mine who with
me sought certain criminals in the pass-
ageways of the city wall has been taken
captive by them and carried off i know
not where i myself was lost having no
light until i heard your scream and found
the window now if the sefiorita will be
so kind as to supply me with light of some
sort a lantern or candles i will go out of
the window again and continue my search
for my friend i was suddenly reminded
of the spaniard by a groan which came
from him

  as for this man i continued no
doubt the senorita valdez has friends who
will take care of him-and of her

   but at this the senorita shook her head
no senor no i have no one this
pig here- she looked with disgust upon
the spaniard-he is my second cousin
he manages to rob me of the little property
my dead father left me he comes to ar-
zila from spain  some business of which
he tells me nothing he brings me with
him to keep house for him he installs
me here in this house he goes about his
private affairs leaving me alone day and
night suddenly he flies into a rage and
accuses me of-of-i know not what but
among many things of encouraging the at-
tentions of some native swine i think
the fool is jealous anyhow he tries as
you have seen to kill me and now i
like you must make my escape from the
city wall or assuredly i shall die-after
what has happened

  unless- she paused and turned a
look upon me which made me gasp-un-
less you have a bullet in your pistol or a
knife in your belt which will put a com-
plete finish to my cousins jealousy
amazing that the warmest blooded wo-
men in the world can also be the coldest
blooded

  or the girl continued when i had
shaken my head positively in refusal to
carry out her plan or perhaps i had bet-
ter do it myself except that you will have
to lend me a weapon as my own knife
was broken up by my cousin

   but this also i refused to do flatly i
had as soon have killed the man myself as
to have had her do it

   in that case then saicl the senorita

shrugging her slim shoulders in that case

senor i must go away at once and you
must help me

  i had to point out to her that much as i
would like to do so that cheerfully as i
would do so if it were not for other mat-
ters-that i would do so later-there were
matters which now demanded my instant
attention namely the search for brandon
grey

  you will be safe i told her as long
as he is tied up you can watch him can
lie him more tighdy if you wish and
no doubt you can make arrangements to
be carried to tangier and then to spain

if it is a question of money-

  i have money enough the girl an-
swered but i am afraid to stay with
him look you she raised her voice
you go in search of your friend you
need lights very well i will supply
the lights i will go with you and carry
them leaving you free to fight that is
what i shall do and then when your
friend is found - will see that i get
safely out of arzila

  i repelled this suggestion she insisted
but it is impossible i said at last ex-
asperated i cannot take you into such
danger

  no lights then she said passionately
am i afraid of danger after having
lived with-that try me and see more-
over if you do not let me go with you i
will follow you

  i was forced to cease protesting the
valuable minutes were flying and what af-
ter all was this girl to me in comparison
with brandon grey if she insisted upon
running into danger against my desires let
her do it

 all right i told her then get ready
speedily and let us begone while you
are getting lights i will more securely tie
up your cousin

  this i did while she went into another
room and incidentally i took from his
pocket a small spanish automatic which i
handed to the girl when she returned with
two native lanterns and a supply of
matches and candles for them

  i opened the window and helped her
through into the corridor i followed
closing the shutters behind me and then i
struck a match to ignite the lanterns which
she held

  while doing so i asked a question out
of mere curiosity or perhaps only because
i was thinking of brandon grey

  who i asked was the native of
whom your cousin was jealous
barbary blood

 her answer came like a thunderclap in
the passageway

 a man named belabbas she said

           chapter vii
            

the hole in the wall

he square candle lan-
terns we carried illum-
inated the passageway
which i now really saw
for the first time it
was a corridor some six
feet wide i judged and
a third again as high
damp and mouldy in spots dry and dusty
in others the floor of it was of stone
slabs and the walls seemed to have been at
one time covered with plaster judging
from the heaps of white dust which lay
along their bases

  our lanterns gave but little light threw
their yellow beams a distance of only a few
yards hence i moved forward slowly
watching the distant darkness for what
might materialize out of it i judged that
i had gone thirty-five or forty paces when
something did materialize namely a wall
in front of which a corridor turned off on
each hand warning the senorita i ap-
proached cautiously similar lateral corri-
dors had not long since held an ambush
gun in hand i peeked cautiously around
the corner but the corridors were quite
empty  thereupon faced by the blank
wall i investigated

 there was this peculiarity however-
that the passageway we were in came to an
end in the lateral corridors and the height
of these and of the opposing wall seemed
to be treble that of the passageway behind
me in other words the cross-wall which
confronted me was like the side of a house
built into the city wall-or the side of
some big room which stretched completely
across the barrier we came out of our
tunnel into an open space and ahead was
a wall some twenty-five feet high and it
appeared to me almost the width of the
city wall itself in it i could perceive no
door or opening of any sort in my first
examination tliat was as i walked along
it the second time in one corner i saw a
glittering disc lying half imbedded in the
crumbled mortar

  i fished it out and stared at it startled
it was an american silver dollar that it
had fallen from above was apparent
therefore i looked up lifting my lantern
as high as i could and a dozen feet above



  my head i distinguished a hole in the wall
  a couple of feet square

   two and two combined with a click
 brandon grey had passed here and the sil-
 ver dollar had either fallen from his pocket
 or had been dropped from him with the
 thought that it might serve as a guide for
 me if i should search for him and as i
 had found it in a corner of one of the lat-
 eral corridors directly beneath the open-
 ing above my head it seemed reasonable to
 suppose that my friend had passed through
 that opening to the other side of the wall

   but how

   i could conceive of several ways in
 which he and his captors-for i had no
 doubt that he was a captive-could have
 gained the opening but these ways were
 closed to me at the moment a rope
 might have been let down to them from
 the room beyond or a rope ladder lowered
 but i had neither rope nor ladder and if
 i had possessed either one of these instru-
 ments i failed to see how i could have at-
 tached it to the opening above perplexed
 yet vowing to pass that wall i leaned back
 against the side of the corridor and raised
 my lantern in order to see as far into the
 hole as possible to determine if i could
  how thick the wall before me was for-
 tune favored me from this angle i saw
 a yellow curve maybe a handsbreadth in
 length which was undoubtedly a segment
 of rope so i thought the rope or the
 ladder by which they ascend or descend is
 kept in that hole remained then for me
 to devise a scheme by which i could get
 hold of the piece of rope which i saw
 not a difficult task providing i could find
 a pole and a bit of wire to fashion a hook
 out of and naturally the only place thee
 things were to be secured was in the house
 we had just left

    come i said to the senorita we must
  go back to your house i explained what
  i needed

    this was the first time i had spoken
 since we had reached the spot my voice
 seemed strangely suppressed thrown back
 upon my ears by the surrounding walls
 the girl turned toward the passageway
 and i started to follow when i heard mv
 name called as from a far distance i
 recognized the voice and in fact there
 could be no one else who would so call my
 name

   grey i shouted where are you

    the other side the wall came the an-
  swer

    i moved back to my former position be-
  neath the hole in the wall


frontier stories

  are you all right i asked him

  the answer floated back through the
hole above my head

   not all right he said but still alive
get to me if you can

  i am going to i told him i am go-
ing now after the means wherewith to
reach this hole in the wall are you tied
up

  worse than that lie answered i
am not only tied up but i am chained into
a stone tub into which they have turned
the water its some ancient torture cham-
ber i think

  i shuddered the picture was vivid

  but there is only a little water coming
in grey continued its intended to
drip slowly

  how long wilt it take- i began but
could not finish but grey understood
me

  i have been trying to figure it he
called back i dont think it will reach
my neck for twenty hours perhaps more
perhaps less i can only guess at it pro-
viding of course the water doesnt come
any faster than it does now better bring a
file or a saw when you come and be
careful too when you return they may
be here and i may be unable to warn you

am going i told him
and with the word i set
off quivering with hor-
ror at the thought of
my friends danger to
make it worse if that
were possible i had
read of this form of
punishment and torture and death it was
psychological torture a torture of the
mind more even than of the body in a
stone basin the sides rising higher than
the victims head a man was shackled by
chains fastened to the bottom of the tub
two short chains held his hands down two
others passed over his knees thus the
victim could not rise could not move ex-
cept perhaps to sway his body three or
four inches

  then the water was permitted to drip
into the tub after a little the pain of
cramped muscles of water-soaked flesh
of perception of the water rising with such
terrible slowness gave way to the horror
of counting the drops as they fell and
at last after the mind had been torn by the
inescapable count it had to face that awful
moment in which each globule of water
became more and more deadly

  yes it was in haste that i led the way

back to the senoritas house the girl kept
at my heels followed me through the win-
dow and then gave a cry looking at her
i saw her pointing to the comer of the
room where i had left the spaniard

  there was no spaniard there even
though i had tied him with no gentleness
whatsoever he was gone

  oh cried the girl he lias escaped
he will return and-and- let us go 
quickly i am afraid

  the quicker the better i told her i
thinking of brandon grey and not of the j
spaniard he was unimportant the i
tiling to do with all speed was to gain ac- i
cess to the torture chamber where water
dripped on brandon grey

  a pole of some sort girl i told her
and quickly a bit of wire i looked j
about the room and could see nothing that
would serve realizing that i still held
the lantern i set it down upon the floor
then noticed the wire handle by which l
had carried it good that would doj
for the wire perfectly i tore it loose from
the tin case

  look you senor the girl cried fromj
another room into which she had gone
will this serve the purpose

  i entered and found her holding a good j
sized bundle of what at first i took to be
brass curtain rods

  yes i answered yes we can make
them serve and took them from her hand
then i discovered that they were not cur-
tain rods but cleaning rods for rifles

  hmph this is queer i said these
lelong to your cousin 

  the girl nodded

  where there are cleaning rods for rifles
there must be rifles i told her does
your cousin by any chance sell rifles
the girl seemed embarrassed hesitated
yes senor i-i think he does she
said at last i think that he has a con-
nection with a factory in barcelona

  i began to understand the presence of
these two spaniards in arzila where there
were not so far as i knew half a dozen
europeans all told that was what sur-
prised me when i had come upon the girl
now it seemed fairly certain that her cou-
sin was selling contraband arms and it
suddenly flashed into my mind that con-
traband arms went very well with the re-
volution being planned by mulai moham-
med and belabbas particularly as the
spaniard was sojourning foi the town
which was apparently mulai mohammeds
headquarters i decided on the moment
that the spaniard was of some importance
barbary blood



after all that the next time he fell into my
hands i would see to it that lie didnt es-
cape

  well i had the wire necessary to make
the hook and cleaning rods could be lashed
together to form a pole this would give
me access to the torture chamber but
one thing more i needed a file or a saw
which would cut metal little chance to
find such a thing here the girl when i
told her of my need shook her head

  i am certain senor she said that
there is no such thing in the house i will
look-we will search-but- senor there
is nearby a shop of a vorker in brass-a
man who makes cups and trays and such
things he would have such an instru-
ment would he not

  nearby you say

  oh very near senor she answered
i think it is but the third or fourth house
beyond here

  good i said i will go and get that
which i need close the door and bolt it
and be ready to let me in quickly when i
return i went to the door and laid my
hand upon the latch as i did so it was
flung open and the spaniard plunged into
the room with two scowling natives at his
heels

  i jumped back and reached for the pis-
tol which i had returned to the holster in-
side my jacket but before i could grasp it
the spaniard was upon me like a tiger he
had a knife in his hand and i had imme-
diately to abandon the attempt to reach my
pistol in order to grasp the hand that held
the knife fortunately i got the spaniard
by the wrist with my left hand and de-
flected his blow then i sent an uppercut
to his chin which had all the strength i
could transmit to it but it failed of its
objective the spaniard saw it coming
moved his head quickly but not quickly
enough to keep my fist from landing upon
his jaw he staggered even as i had
struck with my right i twisted his wrist
sharply with my left and heard the knife
tinkle on the floor but before i could
even think of picking it up the spaniard
leaped upon me taking another blow as he
did so and overcoming my balance bore
me to the floor

  as we fell i remember seeing the two
natives standing inactive just inside the
door and the senorita with the backs of
her hands placed to her lips staring horri-
fied then the blows which the spaniard
was raining upon my face prevented fur-
ther attention to anything except them and
the thought of the knife which lay some-

where near us i saw him glancing about
even as he rained blows upon my head
knew what he was looking for summon-
ing all my strength i managed to throw
him off of me away from the knife roll-
ing over then before he could recover i
seized the weapon turned to meet him on
my knees heard a cry from the senorita-
and then a great blaze exploded in my
head

  i regained con-
sness realization
rhat had happened
slowly my eyes
d me so that i
l scarcely raise the
but when i did so
aw the place where
i was i remembered unconsciously i
tried to move consciously i perceived
that i was bound so tightly that i could
move nothing but my head it seemed
dark in the room my eyes sought the
windows saw that it was darkening out-
side and then remembrance of brandon
grey crashed down upon me like a thun-
derclap my fight with the spaniard had
taken place shortly after midday i judged
it would soon be dark and darkness did
not fall early i guessed it to be fully
eight oclock six precious hours at least
had passed-for six hours brandon grey
had been expecting aid that had not come
-for more than six hours the interminable
drip drip of water in his tub had been go-
ing on

  a wave of rage succeeded the wave of
despair which shook me i strained at
my bonds twisted and turned-and failed
to accomplish any loosening of them what-
soever my head spun lights flashed be-
fore my eyes at the effort i lay quiet
then for a moment thinking that it did no
good to lose control of myself no the
thing to do was to try to ascertain how my
hands were tied and with what and if
possible to set them free unless i could
do so brandon grey would die the
spanish girl had probably been carried
away perhaps killed the ropes which
bound my wrists spelled either life or death
for my friend

  and so i concentrated upon those ropes
but i grew sick again when i discovered
by raising my head sufficiently to see that
each wrist was twice encircled by a stout
rope doubly knotted and that the two
wrists were connected by a rope which
passed completely around my body thus
making it impossible for me to bring my


frontier stories

hands closely enough together so that one
might fuss at the knots which held the
other there were ropes around my knees
and around my ankles these i saw but
did not feel because my legs were numb
and finally  discovered that the rope
which connected my wrists and encircled
my body was so fastened to the floor as to
prevent my turning

  i recalled the manner in which i had
roped the spaniard and of how he had
apparently escaped with ease and i re-
membered too that the bony structure of
some mens hands is such that they cannot
be manacled that they may withdraw their
hands through a manacle no larger than
their wrist i knew the trick of expand-
ing ones muscles when one is being bound
so that when the muscles are relaxed the
bonds wall be loose but of this knowl-
edge i had had no opportunity to make use

  i also remembered bitterly that my
hands were none too small even for a man
and after all these considerations i would
not have given a chinese cash for my
chance of escape-or for brandon greys
chance for life i am something of a fat-
alist but never until that moment did i
realize the shallowness of fatalism the
impossibility of it when every particle of
body mind and spirit cries out that a thing
shall not be

   wondered that the spaniard had not
killed me outright that assuredly had
been his intention when he had attacked me
with the knife what had happened af-
ter that attack could not so far as i could
see make him desire to be more lenient
perhaps he had some use he intended to
make of me perhaps he had discovered the
white skin beneath the shirt and jacket and
had held his hand in order to try to unravel
that mystery or perhaps if the white
skin had not been discovered the natives
had prevented the killing of one of their
own people

  however that might be i knew that un-
less i could secure my freedom before the
tub in the torture chamber should be filled
by that cursed dripping i would desire
with all my heart that the spaniard had
plunged the knife into my unconscious
body i should have been on guard every
moment at least so long as my friends life
lay in my hands i thought bitterly but
self-reproach gained nothing i turned my
attention again to my bonds

  but i made no further progress in the
ensuing hour than i had made before it
was entirely dark now and somewhere
there began a faint tap-tap-tap which took

on the sound of dripping water-although
i knew it wasnot it tried to drive me
mad my wrists had swollen now at
first i could turn them slightly in the rings
of rope which encircled them now they
were chafed and bleeding and swollen and
i could not at last setting my teeth
against the pain i tried to pull one hand
through the circle by main force at any ex-
pense even though the flesh should be
stripped from that hand but the effort
proved useless it hurt excruciatingly
but the hones of the hand were too big to
permit its passage i had to give up at
last to admit that the thing i had to do
was impossible if only i could have
reached the rope anywhere with two fin-
gers only i could have plucked it apart in
time fiber by fiber but i could not
and so giving up the effort i lay there in
the darkness trying to think of some
miracle i might perform but no inspira-
tion came and no miracle and the hours
passed

  i judged that it was near midnight when
i heard the sound of slippers proceeding
along the street they stopped there
came a gentle knocking upon the door
startling me for in all of my thoughts it
had not occurred to me that anyone ex-
cept perhaps the spaniard would come to
tliis house it was not the spaniard now
for he would not have knocked the sum-
mons was repeated well i thought
whatever comes can not be as bad as what
is wherefore i called in arabic for the
visitor to enter

  i heard the door swung open heard foot-
steps in the room but the darkness was so
complete that i could not even perceive
the outline of the figure

  senor francisco questioned my un-
seen visitor he spoke in spanish but i
knew from the guttural tones of his voice
that he was a native and his question sug-
gested to me a plan of escape

  sidi francisco is not here i replied
in arabic if you have matches will you
not make a light my friend sidi fran-
cisco and i were attacked he was car-
ried away and i was left here bound i
will be grateful if you will release me

  i heard a grunt of surprise a fumbling
and then a match sputtered illuminating
the face and figure of a black bearded na-
tive who was looking curiously at me
then gazing about the room his eyes fell
upon one of the candle lanterns we had
left he picked it up lighted it and ap-
proached the corner wherein i lay to stare
down at me
garbary blood



  hmph he grunted again they did
their work well

  too well sidi i replied these
ropes are growing very painful will you
not cut them he rubbed his chin
thoughtfully and i began to wonder if my
ruse would succeed

  it is strange he said i wonder
who would attack the spaniard but i
was ready for this question

  i think sidi that it was some friends
of the sultan he cried out something to
that effect when they seized him and
one said to me that what had happened to
us would happen- i hesitated a moment
then fairly well assured that any night
visitor to the spanish gun-runner would
probably be a friend of the revolutionist
who called himself mulai mohammed i
continued-would happen to all friends
of mulai mohammed	

he native scowled i
realized that my fabri-
cation had been fortun-
ate and my relief may
have been imagined
when he reached within
his cloak pulled a long
curved knife from its
sheath and bending over cut the ropes
which held me i sat up chafing my
wrists and arms and made the surprising
discovery that my automatic was still in its
holster beneath my arm slowly i got to
my feet unsteadily and i was thinking
fast the lies i had told this man had
set me at liberty i had in mind to tell
other lies which might set at liberty bran-
don grey the tap-tap-tap which i had
heard i had finally identified as that of a
hammer upon metal and not far away i
suspected that the brass worker was work-
ing during the night as well as during the
day to get some job finished on time and
i now had it in mind to get from him the
file i needed and to inveigle this native into
helping me get brandon grey out of the
torture chamber

  earlier in the day i would have needed
no help but now i knew that he would be
so weakened from emersion in the water
to say nothing of the effect upon his nerves
of the continual dripping that i would
need help to get him up to the hole in the
wall on one side and down from it on the
other and with this in mind i spoke
again to my unknown rescuer

  i think sidi i told him that i know
where they have taken senor francisco
and if you will accompany me perhaps we

can recover him will you do so

  why not he said i desire to see
him therefore let us go

  but i said i have one matter to at-
tend to first wait here for me for a mo-
ment  left the house and hurried to-
ward the place whence came the tapping
noises there sure enough although the
door of his shop was closed i found the
brass-smith working he opened the door
at my request and was very glad to ex-
change an old file for a spanish peseta
piece in a moment i was back in fran-
ciscos house and found the native stand-
ing as i had left him

  come sidi i said then picking up
the bundle of rods and the hook i had
made now we will go to see if we can
find our friend francisco at my re-
quest he lighted another lantern imper-
turbably he watched me go through the
shuttered window into the passageway of
the city wall and silently he followed me
in due course we came to the transverse
wall beyond which i had left brandon
grey swiftly while the moor watched
with expressionless face i jointed and tied
together the cleaning rods until i had a pole
sufficiently long on the end i fastened
the hook i had fashioned from the lantern
handle when this was completed i
raised the pole carefully got the hook up
to the hole in the wall and over the piece
of rope i knew to be there and pulled
the rope ladder i had visioned came un-
rolling down

  hniph grunted the native is it in
there you expect to find sidi francisco

  yes i lied i think he is here i
gave no time for further embarrassing
questions but called to him to follow me
and hooking a lantern over my arm i as-
cended the ladder reached the hole in the
wall and crawled in my lantern showed
me that the ladder was hooked over a short
iron pin set into the stonework and i was
surprised and pleased indeed that it had
not slipped off of this short pin when i had
pulled it down

  are you coming i shouted down to
the moor then peering over i saw him
put his hands upon the ladder without
waiting for him i slid through the hole and
sat down my legs hanging over the edge
as soon as the moor came up we would
pull up the ladder and use it to descend on
the inside of the wall in the meantime i
called to grey

  are you all right old man i asked
if you are say yes-but dont talk


frontier stories

   righto came back from him but in a
strained weak tone

  the moor should have been up by now
i turned to see what was the matter with
him

  the ladder was no longer hanging over
the book  leaned forward quickly and
peered over thinking that jerhais it had
come unfastened while the moor was as-
cending

   now by the light of the lantern sitting
at his feet i saw the moor holding the lad-
der in his hands saw him throw it into a
corner and then look up at me with a grin
which seemed horrible

  why dont you come up i asked
did the ladder fall down

   no lie answered me i took it down
-in order that you may have a pleasant
visit with your friend senor francisco

  but-but- i could say no more

  the moor then enlightened me

  you will understand better perhaps
he said if  introduce myself to you
whose name i do not know i trust you
will have a pleasant night my name is
belabbas

chapter viii

stacked arms

ell i set brandon
grey more dead than
alive at liberty at last
at liberty that is so
far as the deadly tub
w a s concerned a t
liberty i might say to
enjoy captivity with me
and i felt cheered thereby-mightily
cheered together we could face what
was to come two heads had not been
better than one when i had unknowingly
asked belabbas to aid me but i felt sure
that now they would be

  i must admit that i felt cheap indeed
at the way belabbas had tricked me even
the fact that i had tricked him first into re-
leasing me from my bonds when he had
believed what i had said and had not
known me did not entirely offset in my
mind the chagrin arising from the way
he had fooled me when at last he did learn
what i was up to he had not known me

i had not known him-but he had been the
first to learn there was one thing at
least for which brandon grey and i had
to be thankful belabbas apparently had
forgotten in his undoubted surprise when
i had led him to the hole in the wall my

short absence from the house when  went
to the shop of the brass worker as a con-
sequence of this oversight i had retained
the file which i had procured

  besides this we had a light now the
lantern contained a fairly large candle
which by careful usage would last a con-
siderable time or which if we extinguished
it now and then to conserve it could be re-
lighted with the matches which i had se-
cured from the senorita valdez

  brandon grey was in sorry plight and
i worked feverishly to cut the chains which
held him not because of the height of the
water which was but little above his mid-
dle but because of his physical condition
as the result of being unable to move and
of the icy cold water which had numbed
and paralyzed him but he was a strong
man with a reserve of strength which came
to his rescue as soon as i had dragged him
from the tub partially stripped him and
given him a brisk rubbing in a quarter
of an hour perhaps he was able to walk
about the chamber and something of the
look of a live man had returned to him
then he picked up the lantern and began
to make a careful examination of the dun-
geon wherein we were

  the examination served to cheer us lit-
tle two w-alls of the room were solid
stone as was the floor and apparently the
ceiling a third side was solid save for
the hole through which we had entered
the fourth side bore the outline of a large
doorway which had been filled in with cut
stones cemented together seemingly it
was as solid as the rest of the wall bran-
don grey summed up the situation in a
few words

  cut a hole through this old doorway
with the file he said or tear up our
clothing and so make a rope which we may
be able to cast over the iron peg in the
hole to cut through the wall means days
of work to toss a rope into that hole so
that it will catch on the peg means incon-
ceivable luck which shall we attempt

  belabbas i pointed out will prob-
ably be returning with his friends before
long he knows we have clothing prob-
ably guesses that we would try to make a
rope from it of course it is practically
impossible to get the rope fastened in the
hole even an expert with a lariat and the
best sort of a rope would find difficulty in
casting a noose over a peg set within a
tvvo-foot-square hole a dozen feet above
his head having to make the cast at an an-
gle of perhaps sixty degrees

  grey nodded his head in agreement
barbary blood

looked at the sealed up doorway shook his
head again doubtfully

   we dont know how thick that wall is
he pointed out and we have only the one
tool the file and as you say belabbas
will probably be returning

  here i suddenly bethought myself of
the automatic pistol in the holster under
my arm i drew it forth

  this i offered will hold belabbas
and his friends for a while i think they
will have to come through the hole one
at a time

   i dont think they will try to enter
said grey more probably they will just
put a man on guard outside so that if we
should manage to get a rope fastened it
would not do us any good his idea i
imagine would be just to leave us here-
forever

   in that case i said and i agree with
you its up to us to begin cutting through
the wall

   we selected a stone big enough were it
removed to permit the passage of our
bodies but low enough down to make our
labors at it most efficient a stone waist
high a few jabs of the pointed end of
the file which fortunately for us was large
and heavy revealed that the mortar in
which the stone had been set was nearly
an inch thick this fact was in our favor
as age and dampness had softened it and
its thickness gave us room in which to
work the file had the stone been set in
with the usual quarter-inch of cement our
task would have been almost or entirely
impossible but the walling up of the gate
had apparently been done in haste and
much mortar used to save time of squar-
ing off the stones

  once we had made a little impression
upon the mortar grey extinguished the
candle in the lantern and we worked in
darkness this was unpleasant dark-
ness has a way of illuminating the images
in ones mind and the image which per-
sisted in mine was of the picture in this
stone chamber some days later in case the
wall we were attacking was as thick as
that through which we had passed be-
cause of the apparent haste in its con-
struction we had a right i felt to hope that
it was but one layer of stone in that
case we could break through it but when
we removed the stone on which we were
working would there be other thicknesses
through which we would have no time to
penetrate and suddenly i felt a sicken-
ing sensation as the thought came to me
that even if we did penetrate this wall

what would we find on the other side
perhaps-probably in fact-a dungeon
similar to this one but i kept this cheer-
less thought to myself and in fact we
talked not at all as we worked when
brandon greys hands grew numb from
prodding with the file i relieved him and
thus we continued through the hours

  what is there to say concerning these
hours  what does a man think as he
chips bits of mortar hour after hour with
sure death at his back and only possible
liberty ahead it is true i thought now
and then of belabbas of mulai moham-
med of the spaniard and of the senorita
valdez but to tell the truth they occu-
pied a surprisingly small amount of my at-
tention no in such a situation when
the efforts are being exerted and continued
at a monotonous rate of physical action
the mind rides its own horse and mine
insisted upon ignoring the present situa-
tion and in carrying me back through the
years to re-picture a thousand and one
scenes of no importance whatsoever i
almost laughed aloud when i found myself
thinking of the stupendous bustle that my
grandmother used to wear

  we could not judge the passage of time
-time for us had become only the length-
ening crack between the stones no light
had shown in the hole in the wall no sound
had come to indicate that belabbas or any
of his men had returned only the sharp
grating of the file point against the mortar
and our loud breathing could be heard
these and the infernal drip drip of water
from the pipe above the tub it might
have been six hours we had worked or it
might have been sixteen but at last we had
removed all the mortar the file would reach
on two sides and the top of the big stone
then we thrust our fingers into the crevice
we had created and strove to break the rock
from the mortar beneath it

  it did not move despite our efforts it
was solid as it had been before all our la-
bor nothing remained save to continue
our work upon the mortar which lay be-
neath it

  more hours passed and at length grey
laid down the file i relighted the lantern
and we again seized the stone pressing
downward upon it with all our weight
this time it toppled forward a little and
now we fell to working it from side to
side pulling it forward it came a hairs-
breadth at a time it seemed but it came
and at last it projected so far from the
wall that we got our shoulders under it
lifted it and threw it clear thereafter
 

frontier stories

for some moments we stood there both of
us staring in the hole i was waiting for
grey to lift the lantern and reveal our
fate i suspect that he was waiting for
me likewise suddenly he raised the light
and thrust it into the hole we had made

  at die far end of the hole was a smooth
wall of rock

  or was it rock moving the lantern
closer i thrust the file against the seeming
rock and cried out in relief the file pene-
trated it it was only a coating of stucco
which had loosened from the end of the
stone we had removed a half dozen
pokes from the file and it fell away

  through this hole i crawled took the
lantern from grey and watched him wrig-
gle through then i raised the lantern to
reveal the room we looked about both
of us i think shouted in amazement

                      candlelight showed
jim filp that we had gained ac-
if i i iip cess to an armory
hit ft ill tfi against the walls crude
wooden racks had been
built which bore stands
of arms long narrow
-boxes were stacked in
the center of the room and a glance suf-
ficed to show that they contained guns a
lantern squatted upon one pile of boxes
and several others hung from wires which
had been fixed to the ceiling this room
for some reason was perfectly dry dusty
brandon grey expressed my thoughts
when he said the spaniards storehouse
or mulai mohammeds armory

  but together with this question there
had come into my mind another regard-
less of whose guns these were it was mani-
festly necessary that there should be a
method of ingress and egress to this arse-
nal the house wherein i had found the
senorita valdez connected with the city
wall it seemed almost certain that the
chamber in the city wall wherein we now
stood served as a back room for some
house which abutted the city barrier
whether this arsenal belonged to the span-
iard francisco or to belabbas or to mu-
lai mohammed-and so far as we were
concerned they were all the same-it was
certain that from it was an exit which
would lead us into someones domicile
whose would it be

let us said grey first find the way
out of this place i cannot see any door
i gave a quick scrutiny to the walls it
was true there seemed to be no doorway
this was strange strange enough to set us

both upon a careful inspection of the walls
particularly of that which we knew divided
this room from the house to which it must
be attached but beyond any question
whatsoever that wall was solid stone this
being definitely established we turned to
the other walls but as i have said they
were almost covered with racks holding
rifles of course a rifle rack may be so
built against a door that it will swing with
it but our most careful efforts failed to
locate any such portal a space in the 
center of the wall through which we had j
burrowed contained no racks but to this
wall of course there was no need of giv-
ing attention

  brandon grey and i looked at each other 
with some astonishment and a little amaze- i
ment i began to make a remark when a
sound came to my ears and i stopped
grey heard it too stepped quickly over
to the hole we had cut and poked his head
into it i joined him voices came to us i
somewhat faintly but still clearly enough i
so the words might be distinguished talk 
in arabic concerning what very shortly j
was going to happen to the twro masquerad- 
ing askoris in the torture chamber

  belabbas and his friends brandon
grey backed up a little and whispered

  that was obvious they were return-
ing to make sure that brandon grey and i
were eliminated from opposition to their
plot sounds were perceptible scrapings
upon the floor of the passageway and
against the wall which indicated that they
had brought a wooden ladder very
shortly they would have the rope ladder
in place inside the chamber and would be
descending it was scarcely probable i
thought that the light would be strong
enough to reveal the absence of grey from
the tub or the absence of both of us from
the chamber until they had reached the
floor but then it would require but an
instant for them to perceive that the tub
was empty to find the hole in the wall
that they would be fully armed was a
certainty this thought reminded me of
our own defense

  i had my automatic but brandon greys

i knew had been taken from him how-
ever i chuckled inwardly at the thought
that we had several hundred stands of guns
at our backs

  we had better get some rifles ready

i said to grey because it looks to me as
though there was going to be a fight and
how shall we manage it

  it would have been a simple thing of
course for us with the rifles to have pot
barbary blood

ted belabbas -and his friends as they de-
scended the ladder or after they were in
the room with but little chance of them
injuring us in return i was capable of
the thought but incapable of the execu-
tion of it it would be rotten sportsman-
ship and i knew brandon grey would feel
the same way the suggestion which he
made was more acceptable

  once they are down into the room we
can hold them there with a rifle one of us
while the other tries to find a way out of
this confounded armory there must be
a way he reached over and took a rifle
from one of the racks did you see any
ammunition  he whispered to me sharply

  i had not but i set about looking for
it at first i had expected easily to la
hand upon cartridges then i began to
search in earnest and finally faced the fact
that so far as i could see there was no am-
munition in the place

  anyhow they wont know it grey
grinned and here they come he
poked a rifle through the hole let it rest
upon the stone now he said go
ahead and see if you can find an exit

  i started upon the renewed search

  stay where you are brandon greys
voice snapped out abruptly in arabic

  i saw him smiling sweetly over the sights
of his rifle putting my head alongside
his i saw through the hole the figure of
belabbas and two other natives huddled
in the corner at the foot of the rope lad-
der staring with wide eyes and surprised
mouths at the orifice from which the voice
had sounded and through which a gun
covered them

  suddenly it occurred to me that if i
could but find the exit an excellent piece
of strategy might be executed i could
gain the street return to the house of the
senorita valdez then re-enter the city
wall and returning to the hole through
which the moors had climbed pull up the
rope ladder and take it away with me
leaving them to the same condition of cap-
tivity in which they thought they had left
us no doubt we could find some method
of barricading the hole we had cut through
the wall into the arsenal but i could not
find the confounded exit

  quite unexpectedly however i learned
where it was the rough low pine table
in the middle of the floor was suddenly
tipped over a square opening was revealed
and through this opening appeared the
head and shoulders of francisco valdez
beneath him i saw in that first startled
glance the faces of two moors it must



have been that valdez was as startled as
i we stared at each other while one
might have counted five perhaps then i
reached for my gun and called a warning
to brandon grey quick as i was the
spaniard was quicker his pistol spat
flame and i felt a numbing pain in my
right arm saw that my hand dropped the
pistol i reached for it quickly with my
left hand only to have it leap from beneath
my fingers as a bullet from the spaniards
pistol struck it

ow confusion reigned
the spaniard leaped
into the room bran-
don grey met him us-
ing his rifle as a club
the moors behind the
spaniard joined the
fray brandon greys
rifle had knocked the spaniards pistol
from his hand and it had fallen through the
trap door in the floor quickly valdez
replaced it with a knife i managed to
recover my own pistol only to find that it
had been rendered useless by valdezs bul-
let so in imitation of grey i seized a rifle
and managed to lay out one of the attack-
ing moors i now duelled with the other
one rifle butt against knife and out of the
corner of my eye saw brandon grey en-
gaged in a similar struggle with the cursing
valdez it was a rather even match so
long as we could wield the rifles it was
difficult for our opponents to use their
knives but there was one disadvantage i
did not and neither i judged did bran-
don grey dare to raise my rifle for a blow
which would knock out my opponent that
would have given him an opportunity to
get home with his knife all i could do
was to keep thudding at him using my rifle
much as a billiard player uses a cue and
then i saw the head and shoulders of be-
labbas coming through the wall

  very shortly i realized we would have
five opponents against us

  as i shouted a warning to grey the
moor whom i was opposing having his
back to the trap door sidestepped to avoid
faling into it as i pressed him back then
surprisingly a thing happened which
changed the situation i saw the figure of
the spanish girl rise swiftly from the
trap door saw her hand and arm flick for-
ward saw the glitter of a long knife-and
my opponent screeching from a horrid
cut in his leg jumped forward stumbled
and fell when i looked again the span-
ish girl had disappeared as quickly as i


frontier stories

could do so i jumped to my fallen foe and
with a swing of my rifle gave him a tap
on his head which laid him out i hoped
that i had not killed him but spent little
time considering the matter the span-
iard whom brandon grey was holding off
had little chance now between the two
guns he saw me coming used the fatal
moment to glance at the silent form of liis
ally and then fell beneath a blow from
grev

  belabbas seeing how things were going
pulled himself back into the hole even as i
rushed at him thereupon  seized greys
arm and pulled him to the trap door and
we leaped in i had remembered seeing
a bolt on the other side of the door and
now swinging it down i slid the bolt into
the bolt hole we found ourselves in a
low passageway at the far end of which
was an oblong of light and silhouetted in
this oblong was a girls figure

  we wasted no time there i had noted
that there was a ring on the upper side of
the trap door although the table had at
first concealed it and in fact had scarcely
bolted it before i heard fingers fumbling
at it nor was the door very solid-i sus-
pected that if belabbas and his friends
were to slide a rifle barrel through the
ring and two or three of them pull upward
on it they would tear the door loose from
its fastenings hence it behooved us to
get elsewhere in haste

  i explained this to grey as we hurried
along the passageway

  then said grey we had better bar-
ricade the door ahead of us if we can at
least we ought to be able to hold them for
a while passing through the low door-
way we found ourselves in a room some-
what similar to that room in the span-
iards house where i had lain prisoner
another room ahead of it separated from
it by a big archway contained windows
which i imagined opened onto the street
i looked at the spanish girl after we had
closed and bolted the door found her
disheveled clothes tom and a rope still
upon one arm

  they brought me here and tied me up
senor she explained and i-i knew
that you were also a captive i could not
help thinking about your poor friend in the
water therefore i made every effort to
escape in order that i might aid you or aid
him both perhaps but it was only af-
ter francisco and the moors had gone into
the passageway and after i heard sounds
of fighting that i was able to free myself

  we assured her that she had come to our

aid in the nick of time but she brushed
aside the compliments we would have paid
her

  it is nothing she averred noth-
ing to speak about and now what shall
you do

  we told her then of our plan for barri-
cading the door that was a good idea
she thought and helped us carry chests of
drawers and other articles of furniture
which we piled against the door so that it
would have taken a great force indeed to
break it open in fact i was satisfied
that there would be no exit for belabbas
and his friends in this direction and
that reminded me of my previous plan

  come i said to the girl come and
show me the house of your cousin fran-
cisco

  grey understood my intention the girl
did not need to although i explained it to
her later she led us quickly out of the
house which as i suspected opened onto
a street and down the street a short dis-
tance she paused before a door which she
flung open for us

  again she found and lighted lanterns
for our use as i threw open the wooden
shutters of the window through which i
had already passed more than once swiftly
we passed through the aperture found ouf-
selves in the passageway of the city wall
sped along it until we came to the wall of
the torture chamber

  there sure enough was a wooden lad-
der standing under the hole

  brandon grey sprang ahead of me
mounted the ladder and thrust his hands
forward

  its here he cried looking down at
us and began swiftly to haul up the rope
ladder which hung suspended inside the
room then grinning he came down to
us again and between us we bore back to
franciscos house the rope ladder and the
wooden one

  it seemed to me and it seemed to my
friend that we had neatly captured belab-
bas and his men as well as the spaniard
and his native followers that we had
changed places with them most satisfac-
torily i could not see nor could grey
that they had any more means of making
an escape than we had had perhaps not
so much for luck had been with us in
giving us only a thin wall to penetrate into
the arsenal most anywhere else now we
should have been confronted by thicknesses
of wall which would require weeks to dig
through

  yes it seemed as though we had elim-
barbary blood



inated from the equation the two men who
had thus far given us the most trouble
and that the path was dear now for a
while at least to seek our real game-he
who called himsdf mulai mohammed and
claimed to be the rightful sultan of mor-
occo

chapter ix

i find a sentinel

here was one thing to
be done at once how-
ever and the senorita
reminded us of it that
was to get her safely
out of arzila to get her
feet set with those who
would protect her on
the way to tangier what would happen
to her if her cousin francisco were to
make his escape did not make pleasant
thinking i knew that if he did not know
he would at least suspect and with a span-
iard suspicion is usually as compelling a
force as certainty we must make use of
the time while francisco was a captive to
get the girl to safety

  this at first seemed to be a simple mat-
ter but on further consideration certain
dangers became perceptible

  we do not know brandon grey
pointed out the extent of this plot in ar-
zila nor the number of men who may be
involved i think it would be extremely
hazardous to attempt to send the senorita
to tangier at the present moment its
quite true thac wrapped in a native haik
she might pass through the streets any-
where without being recognized-but that
differs from making a fifty-mile journey
in company with men whose curiosity
would naturally be somewhat aroused
idrees and some of his men are in town
and i could send them with the senorita
but i fancy that in the near future we are
going to have use for them

  but i objected after what the sen-
orita valdez has done for us we cannot let
her remain here in danger

  quite true agreed grey but there
is an alternative we can let her remain
here if she is not in danger what i had
in mind is this there is a house on the
other side of town-where idrees is at
present i suppose-which as you know is
at my service if the senorita has no ob-
jections she could remain there until we
get our business cleaned up and then she
could proceed with us to tangier she
would be in no danger in the house i speak

of because i will see to it that it is al-
ways guarded but i am very much
afraid of setting her feet upon the road to
tangier in company with anyone whom i
do not know

  i will do as the senor suggests said
the girl i am sure he will let no harm
come to me

  in that case we had better travel said
grey i want to get into some different
clothes both you and i dale had better
change our appearance merely as a matter
of precaution now if the senorita will
follow us taking care to hold her haik up
in front of her face the distance is not
long

  we set off across the town and just
when the south gate came into view we
turned off the main road into a by-street
and at greys summons were admitted
into the courtyard of a dwelling house
brandon grey held a rapid conversation
with idrees who had opened the door for
us arranging that the spanish girl be taken
in charge by old fatma the cook idrees
led the girl away and grey led into the
house where came shortly idrees bearing
arms full of native clothing for our use

  the stain we had put on our faces was
quickly removed by a preparation which
grey applied and then after bathing we
donned the apparel of the town moor-
the baggy trousers fine white linen shirt
colored broadcloth vest and over this the
lightweight white sulham and heavyweight
colored one fez and turban white wool
stockings and yellow slippers completed the
outfit-except for the shoulder bag whidi
took the place of pockets and the auto-
matics which were concealed by our robes
scarcely was this change effected when
fatma came bringing an immense tray
laden with food which we ate with gusto
it had been a long time since we had eaten
but in the excitement we had noticed no
hunger pains then a couple of whiskey-
and-sodas and cigarettes while we lay at
ease on floor cushions and discussed plans
for the immediate future

  the house of the fifth door from the
tangier gate said grey was i believe
occupied by mulai mohammed as head-
quarters now either he wtill go back
there which is doubtful or he will find
another house which is probable i do
not think that he knows or will be able to
guess what has become of belabbas but
unquestionably belabbas would have told
him of having imprisoned me in the room
with the tub that is why i think he
would not return to the place where he was


frontier stories

   before the problem then is for us to
locate him

   dont you think i asked that he was
probably in the house of the fifth door
when we entered and that he made his es-
cape with the others into the city wall
if he did where did he go

   that is still another question agreed
grey maybe he was there-maybe he
wasnt if he was he went where belab-
bas and the others went after they had
chained me up which of course means
that there is an exit from the city wall
which we have not yet found

   wouldnt it i suggested be a good
idea for us to go back to the house of the
fifth door remove the barricade and
search for the exit which they must have
known of grey shook his head doubt-
fully 

   i dont like that city wall stuff he said
there are more passages than you would
imagine it is a mighty easy thing to get
lost in the wall we have had a couple
of narrow squeaks and im not looking
for any more of them unless its neces-
sary there is one fact which i dont
believe has occurred to you its this we
entered the fifth house from the city gate
the gate was on our left we turned to
the right now it is obvious that al-
though the passageway on the left led up
to the gate it did not pass it it must
come to an end there consequently
either mulai mohammed and belabbas
went to one of the four houses between
the city gate and the fifth door or there
must be a passageway which we did not
see which leads in the other direction past
the room where i was a prisoner past the
arsenal and the good lord only knows
how much farther if they have also one
of the four houses next the city gate it will
not be difficult to find it out but if they
have not then there is the entire four or
five miles of city wall to explore-an im-
possible feat

   what is your suggestion i asked

   first grey replied to ascertain who
occupies the four houses between the city
gate and the fifth door if they are not
open to suspicion-well then i have a plan
which we wont discuss at present par-
ticularly as i havent got it worked out
quite to my own satisfaction the first
thing to do is to find out about the four
houses

  to the people we passed as we made
our way through the town we appeared
to be two town moors i knew that we
wore our clothing properly that our heel-

less slippers betrayed no awkwardness
one must learn to curl ones toes at pre-
cisely the right moment in the step our
skins were now as white as those of the
average native merchant our beards were
of sufficient growth to serve the conven-
tions and we conversed with each other in
arabic as we walked

  we shall poe brandon grey ex-
plained as two merchants from tangier
who desire to open a carpet shop in arzila
and who desire to rent a house in which
to live we desire moreover a house
as near as possible to the tangier gate be-
cause the mosque of mulai idrees is near
there and because the nearer we live to
the mosque the greater grace shall we ac-
quire in the eyes of saint idrees hence
there will be nothing strange in our in-
quiring about the four houses in which we
are particularly interested

  but who i wondered aloud can tell
us about these houses isnt there an
cimin mustafed or some real estate official
who is in charge of the tax rolls

  thats the man we are going to see
said grey he used to have a little office
not far from the mosque not far from the
tangier gate and i believe he still is
there

e found the official
a fat lazy moor with
heavy lidded eyes and
pudgy hands squatting
in the cubicle which
served him as an office
checking over tax lists
to him we made proper
greeting and grey explained our desires

  as you know sidi he added when
this was done on this side of the street
there are only shops so that the only resi-
dences are on the other side it is one of
those that we should like to obtain if it is
possible

  the arnin mustafed leaned over ponder-
ously cast his eye down the street toward
the houses we had indicated although he
must have known them as well as he knew
his own hand he leaned back again shak-
ing his head slowly

  the fifth house you could have rented
a month ago he said but even that is
now occupied there was some trouble
there yesterday-but never mind we were
speaking of houses the other four-
there is no chance his fat hand lifted
a bulky roll of paper heavy as parchment
unrolled it

  the first house is the property of his
barbary blood

excellency hadj salem terhouni he
droned the second house belongs to the
merchant sidi bushta the third house is
owned by his excellency the basha and is
leased for a term of years to musa zauda
the fourth house was sold during the cur-
rent year to and is occupied by the grain
merchant suliman of fez

  they are all of them known to you
sidi questioned grey the official
looked at him quickly so i mean that
you know they would not be willing to
rent grey hastened to add

  all are known to me pronounced the
amin mustafed heavily they would not
consider rental

  in that case sidi we beg to thank you
for your information we shall look
about perhaps you will permit us to call
again upon you tomorrow in the mean-
time you might recall some other house
which would be suitable for us

  you may call of course said the arnin
and we bade him adieu i realized that
grey had brought the inquiry to an end
very cleverly by failing to pass a few coins
to the arnin to purchase his continued in-
terest in a house for us but we had
found out what we wanted to know ex-
cept for the very slight chance that the
amin was a follower of mulai mohammed
a colleague of belabbas and therefore had
lied to us about the occupancy of the
houses in question-a contingency which
seemed extremely remote-we could rest
assured that mulai mohammed was not
utilizing any of these houses as his head-
quarters

  thus observed grey we can forget
them it now remains to perfect and
carry out my other plan lets go some-
where and think it over

  we returned to the house we had left
not long before to brandon greys ar-
zilan domicile the sun had set and it
was already beginning to grow dark as
we entered the house the fragrant smell of
steaming kcsksoo came to me and shortly
afterward with the senorita valdez as a
guest we were disposing of an excellent
meal prepared by the ancient fatma the
talk did not hang upon the momentous
events through which we had recently
passed grey appeared not to want to dis-
cuss them and neither did i once or
twice the senorita asked questions but
brandon grey cleverly led her thoughts
into other channels she withdrew as
soon as the meal was finished and then my
friend took up the business in hand

  i am going to leave you for a while



he said i am going with idrees to see a
cousin of his who may know something
of value to us concerning mulai moham-
med i would take you with me except
that idrees must go and i do not think we
should leave the house unguarded so long
as the senorita is here

  no one knows of her presence outside
the household i pointed out but bran-
don grey shook his head

  in this country amigo things are
known where it is least to be expected they
would be known i do not know nor does
the senorita how many people francisco is
doing business with we think that we
came to this house unnoticed but we
cant take a chance besides how do we
know how long the city wall is going to
hold francisco and belabbas and the
others 

  you dont think there is any probability
of them escaping do you

  no he agreed i dont think they will
get out until we let them out but they
might there were passages and trap
doors and things of which we did not sus-
pect the existence there may be others
so you be a good chap and stand guard
until i get back i shant be long barring
accidents

  about how long i asked dissatisfied
feeling that i should be with him

  an hour i should say he answered
but dont start worrying for two hours
and then dont worry

  that was easy for him to say neverthe-
less when he had gone i pictured unneces-
sarily perhaps but vividly grey and idrees
encountering belabbas and his men or
francisco or both grey had explained
at my request that he and idrees were go-
ing to a cousins of the latter who lived
near the south gate

  how i asked prompted by misgiv-
ings should i recognize the house if-if
necessary 

  idrees says grey told him that it is
the only house in arzila which has a round
window in the front of it by window
of course i mean an airhole up near the
roof

sat and smoked and
read in the utterly quiet
house until an hour had
passed contentedly
enough but the fol-
lowing hour as it wan-
ed grew more a n d
more disturbing i tried
to laugh at myself for my fears but made


frontier stories

  a failure of it how i asked myself
  could i look back over the events of the last
  two or three days without feeling that dan-
  ger still lurked at our elbows i knew
  morocco well enough to be aware that a
  man a foreigner attendingto his own open
  and aboveboard business could come and
  go where he would day or night without
  mishap but i was also vividly aware of
  the fact that a man cannot mix himself in
  plots or intrigue without drawing danger
  as a magnet draws steel

    i knew the moor and i knew the span-
  iard i knew that having nothing to do
  with their affairs no interest in them i
  could mingle with either or both of them
  on most friendly terms would no doubt
  find them agreeable casual companions
  this would be true of almost every moor
  of almost every spaniard but i also
  knew that to run counter to their interests
  meant making unscrupulous enemies of
  them as it would of their fellows

    hence had brandon grey and i been in
  arzila for mere pleasure i would have
  thought nothing of him going alone even
  to wander through the streets at night
  would unhesitatingly have gone myself
  but now i felt that every native was a po-
  tential enemy and with mulai moham-
  med having his headquarters in arzila it
  stood to reason that he must have many
  followers in the town and all of them
  were enemies of brandon grey and my-
  self

    it occurred to me unpleasantly enough
  that if belabbas were to be fortunate
  enough to make his escape from the wall
  where we had him penned the morrow
  would see a chase of hare and hounds in
  which we would be the hares but we
  could not go and slaughter belabbas and
  the others in cold blood and brandon grey
  did not dare to call upon the local basha
  for soldiers to seize them and imprison
  them in the arzila prison in fact he sus-
  pected that the basha himself was support-
  ing mulai mohammed

    the last minutes of the second hour
  dragged themselves away on heavy feet
  my friend had given permission for me
  to worry when this time had elapsed and
  worry i did and at last after half of
  the third hour had passed i flung my sid-
  ham over my shoulders drew the hood of
  it over my head and went into the court-
  yard thinking that perhaps the night air
  would calm my nerves the courtyard
  adjoined the house and was surrounded by
   a wall seven or eight feet high along one
  side of this wall ran a back street there

were flowers and bushes and a few small
trees in the courtyard which was now
more of a garden than court as the gate
in the wall had been boarded up i slip-
pered around for a few minutes in the
darkness then out of curiosity climbed
upon a big packing case which i noticed
lying by the wall and looked over into
the street beyond as i did so i saw a
dark figure move back against the wall
across the road

  this gave me something to think about
i had made some noise in mounting the
box and no doubt the watcher had heard
me that the man was watching the house
i had no doubt watching or reconnoiter-
ing i hesitated for a moment as to what
to do then drawing my pistol i climbed
the wall dropped to the road and ran to-
ward the spot where i had seen tlie shadow
disappear he ran before i could reach
him paid no attention to my command to
halt ran only the more swiftly when i
fired at him he came to a side street
veered into it and disappeared into the
darkness

  i climbed back over the wall with a good
deal of effort and re-entered the house i
was determined now to go in search of
grey at first after seeing the nun
whom i had tried to kill i had felt that
grey was right that the house should not
be left unprotected but now i reflected
the place would not be molested anyone
who had intended to try to enter or to at-
tack would have been warned that the place
was well guarded i sought old fatma
in the kitchen she had heard the shot but
was not disturbed by it the noise of
gunfire was common because of the pres-
ence of a garrison of native troops but
i was also surprised to see squatting in
the corner an old whiskered man smoking
a long stemmed keef pipe

  i am going out i told her and you
are not to open the door to anyone except
when you hear the voice of sidi grey or
myself moreover- i looked at the
old man-can your man here handle a
gun

  this is my brother she said get
up you lazy fool and listen to the gentle-
man

  the old man grunted laid aside his pipe
and rose

  can you handle a gun i asked him

  of course sidi of course was i
not a soldier for many years his pres-
ent appearance was no affirmative proof
of this still i went into the other room
secured a rifle and gave it to him
barbary blood

  you two will guard the spanish sefior-
ita while i am gone

  there is no need for a gun sidi said
the old man no one will disturb us
nevertheless- he set the gun in a cor-
ner-nevertheless if anyone does as-
suredly i shall slay him

  thus it came about that three hours af-
ter brandon grey had left me i was shuf-
fling through the dark streets of arzila
toward the south gate in search of the
house with the circular window

chapter x

the sultans seal

he african stars il-
luminated things faint-
ly so that i was able
without difficulty to
make my way across
the town and upon
drawing near to the fez
gate discernible for
quite a distance because of the lanterns of
the night guards stationed there i was able
to locate the house of idrees cousin the
dwelling with the circular window so-
called near the rcof it appeared as a
disc of blackness against the white wall of
the house beneath it was a door and
upon this door i lost no time in knocking
there was no answer to my summons and
i hammered again more loudly still no
answer and there was that peculiar seem-
ingly audible silence which pertains to
houses empty of humans nevertheless
after a due interval i rapped again and
no answer being forthcoming to the third
summons i turned away and was debating
what to do when three figures which i had
not seen before approached the house not
to be caught unaware i half drew my pis-
tol from the holster beneath my shoulder
and waited probably the trio were only
passing along the street but i wras not to
be caught off guard i was glad of this
precaution when one of them stepped to-
ward me

  schoon hnaya who is here he
queried i was about to reply that i
sought a certain man named somebody or
other when another voice spoke that of
brandon grey

  i am glad youre here he said i
was going back to the house now to reas-
sure you i suppose you worried

  the man whom i took to be idrees
cousin was now engaged in fitting a huge
iron key into the keyhole of the door it
swung open and he begged us to enter then



urged us to make ourselves comfortable
upon the floor cushions and suggested
coffee an idea with which i was in full ac-
cord  his left grey and me alone while
the two natives made a fire and brewed
coffee in the kitchen and after we had
lighted cigarettes i looked at grey and saw
the gleam of adventurous reminiscence in
his eye well shoot i said what
have you been up to 

  oh nothing much only-i have seen
mulai mohammed and become one of his
followers

  you have what are you joking

  no he affirmed its the truth you
see when idrees and i got here to the
house of his cousin his cousin told about
having noticed quite a number of strangers
coming and going from a house just off the
market-place observant sort of chap he
seems to be at any rate it struck him as
queer that these fellows were all stran-
gers he claims to know everybody in
arzila and most of the country round
about it looked to me as though this
were worth looking into and consequently
we took a walk up to the market-place the
three of us

  there i left idrees and his cousin and
sat myself down upon the matting of a
coffee house from where i could see those
who entered and left the place idrees
cousin had indicated i figured that pretty-
soon some one of them would want some
coffee-you know the cafe here is like the
english pub or the american saloon-and
i guessed right i had not been sitting
there long when a fellow came out shuf-
fled over to the cafe squatted dowm and or-
dered coffee i sized him up as a country
moor not very intelligent and it was not
difficult to get into conversation with him
no use going into that you know how
you would go about it

  the upshot of it was that i convinced
him that i was a kaid just arrived in ar-
zila for the purpose of offering the support
of myself and the men of my village to the
noble mulai mohammed the fool did
not even question me merely assured me
that mulai mohammed was the rightful
sultan and that no doubt he would shortly
be on the throne then i had him but
just for luck i tried out on him the charm
which the black magician gave us in tan-
gier-just showed it to him in the palm of
my hand very secretly

  allah he exclaimed allah kenm
it is the mark of the true sultan so
you were right in your guess you see that
the birthmark which mulai mohammed


frontier stories

sports is the shape roughly of a five-
fingered hand this made me solid with
him and-oh yes i paid for more coffee
for him-and then i became very friendly

  i told him that although i had been
told where to find mulai mohammed i
had gone to the fifth house from the tan-
gier gate but no one was there some-
thing i suspected had caused him to move
his headquarters yes the fellow said
something had happened he did not know
just what but he could now be found at
a house across the street

 i am going back there myself soon he
said you can go with me if you wish
naturally i wished so he led me across
the street gave a couple of raps thrice re-
peated upon the door we were admitted

  brandon grey stopped and i could not
help exclaiming at his luck

  and you really saw mulai moham-
med-or the man who claims to be he

  i actually did grey answered grin-
ning sure enough this bird from the
country-who by the way was going to be
basha of el ksar he told me when mu-
lai mohammed became sultan--this bird
took me into the presence mulai mo-
hammed was sitting in an arm chair while
a dozen natives sat around him in a semi-
circle cross-legged upon the floor

   another follower for you sidna my
countryman said loudly as we entered
yes he gave the impostor the royal title
of sidna a kaid who comes to offer
himself and his village

  the pretender was masked his face
was covered from the edge of his turban
to his chin with a crimson cloth in which
were two eyeholes

   it is well said mulai mohammed
assuredly allah will smile upon those who
support justice verily i am the rightful
sultan in proof of which behold the sa-
cred mark with that-i had a hard time
to keep a straight face old man it was al-
most like initiation into a lodge-with that
he stripped away the clothing from his left
breast and revealed a red birthmark shaped
like a human hand

ell i did the neces-
sary i prostrated my-
self and bumped the
floor with my forehead
and invited allah to
smile upon this worthy
descendant of the
prophet and our right-
ful sultan personally i think that allah
was not only smiling but laughing as well

but to get on with the story we appar-
ently had entered in the middle of a dis-
cussion or a giving of orders for now mu-
lai mohammed continued the giving of
them

  ill cut it short at four oclock tomor-
rom morning-yes thats right it isnt
midnight yet-at four oclock tomorrow
morning all of his followers are to gather
at the house and in the market-place
thence to launch an attack upon the garri-
son its the idea of mulai mohammed 
first to seize the garrison with its arms
and ammunition-and i take it that some
of the soldiers themselves have been se-
duced to his cause-and then to seize the 
town in the belief that most of the towns-
people will then rally to him they might i
at that because one of the birds i saw sit-j
ting at mulai mohammeds feet was our
well known basha and thats that

  so i said the revolution breaks at
four a m

  according to mulai mohammed it
will said grey but according to bran-
don grey it wont not if i can help it
but how the deuce can you i de-t
manded you and i and idrees and his
cousin cant very well fight the whole town
of arzila including the basha and the gar-
rison

  no said grey thats true but
you have no doubt heard the local proverb
which says that little by little the camel
goes into the stewpan very shortly we
are going to begin to make stew

  t await orders then i told him and
by the way wasnt there any curiosity
about the missing belabbas

  mulai mohammed mentioned him and
i judge from what he said that belabbas
had been intending to leave arzila on some
mission or other on the very day we locked
him up so they are not worrying about
him

  well i asked him then whats your
program i am perfectly at your service
to carve the camel

  the first thing we are going to do
answered grey is to make you basha of
arzila

  when grey told me that i thought he
was joking then seeing that he wasnt
wondered whether he had gone slightly in-
sane the idea was bizarre but he was
perfectly in earnest and very shortly we
set forth upon the first of our missions

  the basha he explained as we went
along left the meeting for some purpose
which i did not discover but he was to
report back to mulai mohammed within

r  	-is  	-uul  -
an hour or two his business of course
was concerned with the arrangements for
the intended seizure of the town in the
morning he went to his own residence
and that is where we are going

  the bashas house i found when we
reached it was not a very pretentious place
but enough so to serve as the abode of the
basha of a small town like arzila there
was a big and fancy doorway in the front
of the place which i knew must enter into
the garden in which the house was set
this gate was unlighted and so far as we
could determine unguarded the nar-
row street which approached it came to
an end at a broad cross street which ran
past the residence and in this dark canyon
like passageway we waited

  i dont think whispered grey that
he has left his house yet to return to mu-
lai mohammed but we will catch him
either coming or going

  we had not long to wait the gate
creaked as it swung back and was drawn to
again a portly figure hastened toward
us across the street apparently the basha
was keeping this business a secret at least
he was not running around the town this
night with a bunch of guards it would
have been better for him if he had been
as it was he walked into our arms and
before he could do more than grunt in
surprise brandon grey had seized him
and i had wrapped the hood of his sulham
around his face and neck choking off any
noise i heard a tinkle of metal a click
and saw that grey had handcuffed the
bashas hands behind him and now my
friend addressed the man in no uncertain
terms

  that which you feel poking you in the
ribs sidi traitor he said in arabic is
a pitol of large caliber which will make a
most unsightly hole you desire to know
who i am of course i shall tell you i
am the man authorized by our sultan mu-
lai abd-el-aziz to execute without trial
any man whom i suspect of rebellion and
more specifically any man whom i sus-
pect to be a follower of one who calls
himself mulai mohammed i not only
suspect you  i know you are guilty your
life is in my hands you may buy it for a
price

  i-i am no follower of mulai moham-
med the man gasped the words as i
loosened the throttling cloth a little

  you lie grey told him bluntly i
have just come from a meeting where i
saw you at the feet of mulai mohammed
where i heard you accept instructions from



you were returning to him now
i felt the big figure grow limp

  what-what is your price sidi he
asked

  you do not wish to die then-for your
sultan mulai mohammed

  no sidi quavered the man

  in that case rasped grey you will
lead us into your house into your office
where we will discuss the price of your
life lead on then but do not forget that
at the first sign of treachery a bullet will
tear your heart to pieces

he big gate swung open
again under the hand
of the basha closed un-
der mine i bolted it
behind us the basha
led us through a dark
garden to a little side
door of the house we
entered that and found ourselves in a large
room fitted up as an office in the native
style the basha obeyed greys motion
and seated himself upon the cushions
then grey examined the doors and locked
them pulled aside every hanging with
which the walls were covered to make sure
that there were no hidden doors through
which we might be surprised there were
no windows to bother us two huge can-
dles in floor candlesticks lighted the room
but there were half a dozen others standing
around and these grey also lighted

  at his suggestion i picked up a round
table perhaps a yard in diameter but not
more than eight inches high on which were
paper bamboo pens ink and a dish of
sand for blotting purposes and set it down
within the bashas reach while i wras do-
ing this grey searched the moor relieving
him of the long curved knife called kum-
iah which almost every native carries re-
lieving him also of a small caliber pistol
then he unlocked the handcuff from the
bashas left wrist but snapped it around
the mans left ankle the position this
caused did not seem comfortable but it
fairly well precluded any rash actions on
the part of the native official

  these things being attended to grey
stood in front of the basha staring down
at him coldly and stated his desires

  have you a khalifa he asked a
khalifa is a vice-basha

  no sidi i have not at the moment
replied the moor

  strange commented grey but i sup-
pose you were waiting to see who would
pay the largest amount for the job it is

barbary blood

             him


frontier stories

well however in that case there will be
no conflict of authority then my friend
squatted cross-legged before the little ta-
ble reflectively lighted a cigarette and
took several deep draughts of smoke then
began to write

  i watched him wonderingly writing
arabic swiftly is a rare accomplishment
for a foreigner but greys hand moved
swiftly from right to left across the jage
and in a surprisingly short time he had
written half a dozen lines then he made
a tangle of lines which i knew to be a sig-
nature although i could not read it and
finally he fished around in his bosom drew
out a thin chain at the end of which dan-
gled a metallic obect this came apart in
his hands and i saw that it was a rubber
stamp he impressed it above the signa-
ture

  do you know- he held out the paper
for the inspection of the baslia-that
seal

  the moors eyes bulged and he made an
instinctive bow of reverence

  that he said is the seal of our lord
and master sultan mulai abd-el-aziz
upon whom be peace

  i thought you would recognize it said
grey dryly and this document upon
which i have just placed the seal appoints
in the name of the sultan a new basha of
arzila i present him he looked at me
with a twinkle in his eyes sidi alarbi
ben hassan he said extending me the
paper here is your commission as basha
of our city

  i was amazed too at the native name he
had bestowed upon me but at the same
time i perceived that this thing was serious
and in order and i also perceived that
my friend brandon grey had a standing
with the sultan of morocco which few men
have ever possessed possession of a du-
plicate of the sultans seal gave him the
power of an autocrat and while it was
not a power that could be used too freely
too openly he possessed the power of in-
flicting death at his pleasure the seal was
full proof of that

  and now commanded grey to the
basha whom i had superceded write you
a message to the captain of the garrison
informing him that you have been ab-
ruptly summoned to fez by the sultan and
that you have been relieved by your suc-
cessor who bears appointment from his
majesty also that the bearer of your mes-
sage will exhibit this appointment in proof
of his identity

  the moor obeyed writing industriously

for a few minutes and then passing the
paper over for brandon greys inspection
it was satisfactory it appeared and grey
folded it and passed it to me

  and now he addressed the moor
again one more message i will tell you
what to write write to the sidna mo-
hammed ben el-kewak-which i believe is
the full name claimed by your mulai mo-
hammed-write thus

  while engaged upon a certain matter in
accordance with the instructions of your
majesty i had the misfortune to fall and
break my leg as the result of which it is
impossible for me to return to you this
night to inform you of what i have done

i am sending you this by the captain of my
guards to act as your escort and beg that
in view of the importance of the matters 
had in hand on your behalf you will pay
me the great honor of coming to me so
that i may explain to you what arrange-
ments i have made

  once while he was writing this the pen
of the basha stopped he looked up with
grim face into the still grimmer face of
brandon grey-then went on with his j
writing

  treason to mulai mohammed he j
muttered

  loyalty to mulai abd-el-aziz coun- 
tered brandon grey write

  and when the message was finished and i
sanded and folded in the peculiar manner 
of moroccan correspondence grey un- j
fastened the handcuff from the bashas an-
kle then turned and unlocked the door

  rise now and summon the captain of
your guards bid him deliver this mes-
sage with all speed to mulai mohammed j
and to escort him hither but do not for- j
get the pistol which will watch you from i
beneath my sulham

  with that grey squatted down upon the
cushions near the door so that- his back i
was almost toward it while he fad the
basha the basha crossed the room to a
cord which hung from the wall pulled it 
in the distance a bell tinkled presently
there came a sound of footsteps the door
was thrown open and a tall dark native
stood there in the uniform which indicated
that he was captain of the household
guards for a moment i thought the
basha hesitated i saw a little motion be-
neath the folds of the sulham which lay
across greys lap and perhaps the basha
saw it also because drawing a deep breath
he handed the message to the captain
barbary blood

  carry this to the house where dwells
the sidna mulai mohammed he ordered
and escort hint back to us if it is his plea-
sure to come

  the captain saluted and withdrew clos-
ing the door grey rose swiftly and slid
the bolt into place again and then we sat
in silence and waited for the coming of
the man who claimed the moorish throne

chapter xi

behind the mask

hen at last we heard
the awaited tapping at
the door it was grey
who slid the bolt and
permitted it to swing
open i n accordance
with his suggestion i
had taken up a position
upon the cushions beside the basha-in
case of contingencies i did not have the
slightest idea nor do i think that he did
that the basha would make any false
moves but we did not intend to give him a
chance

  we rose of course as the man called
mulai mohammed entered

  dismiss the captain i muttered to the
basha and at a word from him the captain
of the guards closed the door and went
away then brandon grey again slid the
bolt fastening the door

  at that sound the masked man who
stood before us turned quicldy only to re-
coil from the muzzle of the pistol grey had
unholstered

  watching this tableau i noted that the
pretender to the moorish throne was a man
apparently of greys own build the same
height and breadth of shoulder but if one
could judge by his clothing somewhat
heavier set

  for what seemed to me minutes the
mask stared at the pistol in my friends
hand then raised to search his face i
thought that the man must be shaken with
surprise overcome by his apparent betrayal
at the hands of the basha but i was to
learn that surprised and angered as he un-
doubtedly was he had been doing some
swift thinking in that brief interval

  with admirable nerve he proceeded to
turn his back squarely to the gun in greys
hand and to stride without a word toward
the basha

  obviously this reaction puzzled grey as
it did me but the explanation came with
lightning-like quickness the half dozen
paces across the room had given him time



to thrust his hand inside his sulham now
he swung about and leaped upon grey
who was close behind him it was a des-
perately brave action he could not
know as i did that grey did not dare to
fire because a shot would bring the whole
household running and if grey had been
willing to shoot mulai mohammed would
have met quick death as it was i saw
grey parry the upward stroke of the ter-
rible curved kumiah with a downward
sweep of the pistol i saw him toss his
gun onto the cushion behind me and as a
continuation of the same motion seize the
wrist which held the knife i took two
steps forward to his assistance he saw
the action shook his head

  i can handle him he said you
watch the basha

  i had known that grey was strong but i
could see that the big native was no weak-
ling nevertheless under greys grip the
hand which held the knife turned slowly
against its will while greys other hand
and arm was locked around his antagonist
slowly the wrist turned the tendons stood
out like small ropes and at last the knife
clinked upon the floor and slid toward me
i picked it up and thrust it into my belt
grey would not want it would not need it

  for man to man the moor offers but
poor resistance the art of boxing is al-
most unknown to them although they do
know something of jiu-jitsu and i knew
that grey was an expert with the gloves
i had scarcely time to think of this before
i saw him release his hold upon the moors
arm feint with his left and as the moor
instinctively guarded his masked face gave
an uppercut to his jaw the pretender to
the moorish throne dropped as though he
had been pole-axed

  allah kcrim i heard the basha grunt
as for me i think i applauded but i am
not sure

  and now said grey grimly lets see
the face of this gentleman with the political
aspirations

  mulai mohammed lay stretched upon his
back and bending over grey tore from his
face the silken mask

  it was a face of no distinction its
complexion was dark enough to intimate
the presence of mixed blood and it was
flecked with white where smallpox had
left its scars a close-cut and somewhat
sparse black stubble ran over cheeks and
chin and upper lip the lips were coarse
and heavy drawn back now to show a few
yellow teeth and above them a large nose
had negroid characteristics there was
frontier stories

good reason i thought as i looked at this
face for him to keep it masked the
mother and father from whom he pre-
tended to have sprung mulai el-hassan
and his sultana were white

  grey turned from a study of the face
to look at the basha with a quizzical smile

  you have seen this face before sidi
it was a statement rather than a question

  the basha nodded

  you of course did not believe that he
was the son of mulai el-hassan con-
tinued grey the face of the basha de-
spite his predicament grinned faintly

  it was necessary that he should be
he answered

  do you know who he is-really ques-
tioned grey the basha shook his head

  nor care he said

  nevertheless i shall tell you in-
formed grey this man is a native of
algeria not of morocco two years ago
he was condemned in algeria for murder
-or for three murders to be explicit-
and sentenced to death he managed to
escape into the mountains and came across
them into morocco a year ago his
name is bu-hamara and- whats that

  the basha jiad made a peculiar sound
i had been looking as had grey at the
algerian now we both looked at the
basha who was purple faced and bulging
eyed

  you say he gasped you say-that
is bu-hamara

  beyond a doubt grey assured him
i have a photograph to prove it why

  the basha came toward us staring at
the prostrate algerian then before we
could guess his intention threw himself
upon him in a frenzy of rage lacking
the use of his hands he bit at the exposed
neck like a beast of prey we pulled him
away as soon as we had recovered our mo-
mentary surprise then upon his knees
at our feet he begged for gun or knife or
even that his hands be unshackled that he
might kill this man whom he had plotted
to make sultan

  if he is as you say he is the dog that
killed my father a year ago in fez let
me avenge my father let me kill the
dg

  no grey denied him even though it
is indeed as you say this man a year ago
killed hadj malek abderaman of fez
was he indeed your father

  aiwa yes sidi hadj malek yes
will you not permit me to kill this man
but again grey denied him drew him to
his feet and led him back to his cushion

where with head bowed to his knees he
sat and groaned i could not blame him
it was a queer and malicious trick o fate
that he should have turned traitor to the
sultan should have fallen into the hands
of brandon grey probably would lose his
bashalik and perhaps be imprisoned by the
sultan in the dungeons of fez all for the
man who had killed his father

  it was unfortunate but we had no time
to waste upon the basha it occurred to
me that he might be of use to us now but
a moments thought sufficed to reject this
suggestion even though the moor might
revenge upon his fathers slayer he would
also acutely desire his own freedom es-
cape from well deserved punishment
wherefore we could not rely upon him in
any way

  well i was basha of arzila a truly in-
credible fact and i wondered what grey
had planned for me to do in that capacity

  i was soon to learn we made short
work of tying up the pretender and of
making assurance doubly sure by using
another pair of liandcuffs wliich grey pro-
duced to shackle his wrist to an ankle i
felt that we did not consider his comfort
very much but it seemed to me we had
made sure that he would not get loose
this being done we chucked him into a
corner and withdrew into an alcove out of
earshot of the others for a consultation
and the upshot of this conversation was
that a quarter of an hour later i had
learned the part i was to play and had left
the bashas residence to make various
preparations and to ascertain if all was
as it should be at greys house grey
elected to remain with his natives assuring
me that he intended to snatch a couple of
hours sleep and advised me to do the same
but as i had to be on foot again an hour
before the meeting scheduled for four
oclock in the morning i had little rime for

rmed with my docu-
ment of appointment i
sought the small mili-
tary garrison and more
particularly its captain
my authority was su-
preme in arzila except
for brandon grey-
and except for that situation which modi-
fies all authority even the highest namely
willingness on the part of ones subjects
to obey or force enough to make them
obey discontent was rife in morocco
principally as the result of the machina-
barbary blood

tions of european powers thus the time
was propitious for the arising of pretend-
ers and other disturbers of the nations
iieaee and disloyalty to his majesty abd-
el-aziz was to be encountered in many
quarters where change of sultans might
react to the gain of the individual

  i knew from brandon grey that there
were traitors among the little force of
seventy-five or a hundred soldiers in the
arzila garrison that some of them were
known to be looking with favor upon the
claims of the pretender mulai moham-
med the former captain of this garri-
son had been involved in this movement
grey had told me but either by accident
or intention a rifle had gone off in his
vicinity with results fatal to him grey
understood the new captain to be one kaid
xattar and had little confidence in his loy-
alty but loyal or disloyal the document i
carried should serve to bring the captain to
order-particularly as i had been author-
ized by grey to tender him for his sup-
port in this matter not only a better posi-
tion but certain english banknotes which
i carried money talks a universal lan-
guage

  i came eventually to the garrison gate
was carelessly halted by a slovenly and
sleepy guard who shook his head when i
demanded admittance to the captain stat-
ing that the chief was asleep it would
have been useless to have made any ex-
planations as to my identity to this stupid
fellow but i knew of the astonishing fear
they have of documents with official seals
and with good reason because there are
extremely few of them who can read but
many who know by sad experience that
an officially sealed paper often carries
grief letters from high officials are
therefore met with great reverence in
many cases amounting to kowtowing or
prostration as though the letter were the
person of the writer himself

  in the light of the lantern hanging on
the gate i showed the guard the document
i carried-pointed to the official seal of
the sultan the fellow came out of his
sleepiness most abruptly and after pay-
ing due reverence to the symbol of the
lord and master of the country made haste
to unlock the gate and to lead me through
the garrison straight to the one individual
domicile the house of the captain there
another sleepy sentry halted us staring
stupidly at me

  this excellency said the guard from
the gate bears a letter from the sidna
mulai abd-el-aziz present arms and in-

form his excellency the captain

  the second guard came to life abruptly
as the first had done letters from the
sultan are usually received in a city only
to the accompaniment of the thunder of
twenty-one guns from the local battery

  but before the guard had applied his
knuckles to the portal of the captains
house the door swung open and a man
stood framed in the doorway his face il-
lumined by the lanterns hanging on either
side of him

  what is this he demanded what
do you say concerning a letter from his
majesty

  the guards looked at me and i looked at
the captain i stepped forward quickly
and spoke

  hadj wazzani i exclaimed calling
him by name so you are captain of the
garrison let us enter your house then
and i will explain the business i was
relieved for this was not the unknown
kaid attar but one whom i had met and
known fairly well in tangier a man i
liked and who i believed was loyal to the
sultan

  my words startled him he leaned for-
ward to peer into my face and i took ad-
vantage of this to whisper my name at
that his face cleared he drew me into the
house and closed the door

  and so he said after i had explained
the situation and my desires and so this
boil comes to a head shortly eh well
high time high time i was planning
i may tell you to have a few private exe-
cutions here in the garrison in the near
future yes i have known that things
were stirring in arzila but i arrived only
a few days since and one cannot be too
hasty in handling such a situation espe-
cially as the basha- he hesitated

  particularly as the basha was mixed up
in it i completed for him well the
basha is out now

  that is well he commented never-
theless the basha i believe was really
forced into his position he is greatly in
debt and his debtors were supporting mu-
lai mohammed notably one called belab-
bas

  yes i said and belabbas must be
placed where he can support no other pre-
tenders

  hadj wazzani agreed with me heartily
but i did not tell him then of where i be-
lieved belabbas to be at the moment an
omission which i was later to regret

  time was passing swiftly and there were
other matters needing my attention


frontier stories

   you can then i asked pick out two
score honest fellows of your garrison upon
whom you can depend 

  assuredly my friend assuredly he
said in fact practically all that i have
done in the few days i have been at this
post is to discover what kind of an army
- he laughed at the word-i have
and you are acquainted with the man
who owns the coffee house across the street
from the place where the meeting is to be
held

   i know him well the captain assured
me we come from the same town and
he is loyal i rose

   then at four oclock you will have ar-
ranged to be concealed with your men in
the coffee house awaiting the signal from
me which will be two pistol shots

   it is already arranged sidi have no
fear on that score there is a rear en-
trance to the coffee house on a back street
through which i can send my men without
being seen a few at a time i will begin
the business at once

  and then i had the pleasure of using
as reward that which i had thought to use
as a weapon

   i am authorized to tell you i said
in the name of his majesty that a better
post will be yours as the result of your
work tonight but i did not mention the
banknotes i carried hadj wazzani was
not that kind of a man

  thereupon i went away from the garri-
son and started for brandon greys house
where i had left the senorita the street
i followed passed very near the house
where we had barricaded the door against
the egress of francisco and belabbas

  time pressed i knew it had been two
oclock when i had started for the cap-
tains house it must now be three or
later nevertheless the impulse seized me
to take a look at the barricade then i
felt that the impulse was silly caused by
my curiosity and started on my way again
but it would require only live minutes and
the impulse was there so i turned re-
traced my steps and covered the short dis-
tance down a side street to where the house
was

   i was startled when i reached it to see
that the door was open startled and put
on my guard i listened carefully for
any sound which might indicate people
within heard none and struck a match
there was no one in the room i ad-
vanced into the passageway the match
burned out and i struck another its yel-
low gleam showed me that the barricade

had been removed that the door into the
city wall was ajar

ery quickly i made my
exit from that house
and outside i drew
my pistol and held it
ready belabbas and the
others might now be at
liberty or so far as i
knew the man who had
moved the barricade might just have fin-
ished doing it and be still within the wall
himself it occurred to me to re-enter the
house and replace the barricade but i had
to reject the plan at once i had not the
time for this labor which after all would
be useless in case the escape had already
been made as seemed probable more-
over i could not afford to risk being at-
tacked and overpowered by belabbas or
the spaniard or both leaving brandon
grey unaided and the captain of the garri-
son without anyone to give him the signal
as arranged my first duty it seemed was
to protect myself in order that greys plans
might be carried out therefore i went
swiftly away from that place of danger

  i had not gone far however when i re-
called the man whom i had seen watching
the house at whom i had fired unsuccess-
fully had that man been belabbas or
the spaniard as grey had said we
could not tell in such a place as this who
might know or suspect our actions was
the man i had tried to kill one of our en-
emies reconnoitering the house previous to
an attack in force if belabbas or the
spaniard were at liberty it was beyond me
to guess what they would do we had
sent idrees and his cousin to guard the
house it was true but it was quite on the
cards that belabbas could take with him
enough force to overcome all the resis-
tance they could put up

  it was therefore with hurried and per-
turbed feet that i hastened toward the
house of brandon grey as i swung
around a corner pistol in hand into the
street running by the house i heard
sounds sounds which speedily resolved
themselves into the noise of combat i ap-
proached and saw figures struggling in the
darkness then a pistol shot was fired
and another and another

  even though my principal duty might be
to brandon grey and his plans i could not
let idrees and his cousin wage unequal
warfare against an undetermined number
of men who i felt certain included be-
labbas and the spaniard that they were
barbary blood

fighting furiously was evident

  idrees idrees i shouted as loudly
as i could and plunged across the street
toward the twisting shadows

  idrees i called again i could not
shoot not knowing friend from foe

  here sidi said a voice as a crouch-
ing figure approached and rose

  call your cousin i commanded to
come here to us

  he is wounded lying beside the wall
panted idrees there were five one i
killed

  and then the coast being clear i began
shooting a black figure plunged toward
me and i let him have it bringing him to
a heap at my feet the others followed
idrees swung a rifle as a club and i heard
its impact upon a head and then my
automatic clicked failed to fire was ex-
hausted of ammunition i did not need it
however for now our two opponents who
were able to do so turned and lied into
the darkness

  i fished in my pocket for matches failed
to find them and was about to ask idrees
for some when i heard shouts from within
the house the door swung open and lan-
tern in one hand rifle in the other fatmas
ancient brother stood in the doorway wag-
gling his beard and demanding what in the
name of mulai idrees people thought they
were doing shooting in the streets and
keeping honest folk awake he baa-ed
there like a nanny goat until i took the
lantern from his hand and with idrees
turned to see what the light would show

  almost at the gateway of the house lay
idrees cousin

  it is only a bullet through the shoul-
der sidi nothing serious he greeted

u

  we lifted him to his feet found that he
could stand and took him to the gate
where the old man stood and let him rest
there then returned to see wliat of the
foes had fallen the first we came upon
was a native unknown to either idrees or
myself a vicious looking fellow and very
dead

  at a little distance lay another i low-
ered the lantern and saw that it was fran-
cisco the spaniard and a purple hole in
his forehead indicated that he would run
no more guns i guess i hoped that the
third man would be belabbas he was
groaning and groaned worse when we
turned him over to see who he might be
it was not belabbas and at first i thought
i did not know who it was then remem-
brance came this was the man sidi

achmed lahya who had sat across the
table from me at brandon greys home the
night i rode to el-menar in the attempt
to capture belabbas

  now i saw in a flash why grey later
had asked me what i thought of him and
i saw too how the black magician had ac-
quired his eerie knowledge of our plans
apparently brandon grey doubting this
man had let fall in his hearing something
which would lead him eventually to reveal
himself and without any particular harm
to greys own plans even as i was think-
ing this the fellow opened his eyes stared
at me

  how do you do sidi dale he said
and with a convulsion died

  we carried the bodies into the courtyard
and closed the door and then idrees set
about attending to the injuries of his cou-
sin my thought now wfas to get word to
brandon grey to warn him that belabbas
was at liberty no telling what the man
might do-grey in going to mulai mo-
hammeds house at four oclock might walk
into a fatal trap was there yet time to
go to the bashas house and wrarn him i
looked at my watch stared at it-it seemed
incredible that so much time had passed
it now lacked only twenty minutes of four
oclock what the devil should i do if
i went to the bashas house to warn grey
i might not find him there i probably
would not already perhaps he had gone to
the meeting mulai mohammed had called
perhaps had walked into a trap set for him
by belabbas or he might be on his
way no i resolved my job was to get
to that meeting in a hurry to be there
when grey arrived if possible so that in
case of danger i could summon the captain
and his men from their hiding place across
the street

  but if belabbas were already there he
would recognize me-and i had no doubt
as to what he would try to do in that case
a disguise of some sort was necessary
with only a moment in which to make it
however i must do the best i could and
trust to luck that the little alteration in my
appearance would serve wherefore i
borrowed a piece of idrees turban cloth
and wrapped it around my neck and the
lower part of my face as though i suf-
fered from some ailment also i dosed
it liberally with a strong smelling liniment
i found at hand and over one eye i
suspended by a string around my head be-
neath my turban a little flap such as is
used by the semi-blind to cover the bad eye

  then with dirt from the garden i

smeared myself a little as to face and hands
and turban exchanged my sulham of blue
broadcloth for one of brown homespun be-
longing to idrees i slipped another clip
of cartridges into my pistol put several
other clips into my shakarah thus ar-
rayed i started off for the meeting

chapter xii
the masked sultan

t was yet dark no
lightening in the east in
presage of that false
dawn which would for
a moment light the
world as a match flick-
ers in a darkened room
before a lamp is lit
mulai mohammed had chosen well the
time to place his fortune to the test the
sleeping town would have awakened to find
itself possessed by a new regime there
would have been no struggle because while
the moroccan natives out of sheer love of
fighting would have united to repel an in-
vading force their sense of fatalism de-
prived them of the desire and the energy
to overthrow a usurper who had already es-
tablished himself

  in other words they would contend
against a thing not yet accomplished even
though that thing might be best for them
but they would not oppose a change al-
ready executed even though it might be
bad for them there is merit in this view-
point if the usurper maintains his posi-
tion he has no cause for grudge against you
who did not oppose him if he is ousted
one can always say that at least nothing
had been done in active support of the
fallen usurper non-action has merits
when dawn should come with the crow-
ing of the roosters and the barking of
the dogs and the odors of the steeping
coffee and bubbling breakfast pots in the
air the populace of arzila would have
learned the news

  nevertheless this must not interfere
with breakfast it would have said to it-
self and during the breakfast interval
would inevitably reach the conclusion that
what had taken place must have been or-
dained by allah or it would not have hap-
pened wherefore it would be manifest
sacrilege to dispute the matter
i hence it was still in the darkness that i
made my way to the house where the fate-
ful meeting was to be held other pedes-
trians passed me in silence hastening i
supposed t the same destination and

when at last i reached the place  found
the big front room well filled and half a
dozen or more natives standing about out-
side discussing in low voices the matter
in hand i paused outside to observe what
was going on the door of the house was
half open and although the room was
only dimly lighted by a couple of lanterns
i could see that the floor space was pretty
well covered by squatting natives

  mulai mohammed has not yet arrived
i heard the question put by a native who
had just come up

  not yet came the answer all is
in readiness however now we merely
await the coming of the sidna no doubt
he will come with belabbas

  hmph i grunted to myself belab-
bas might come it was true but nothing
short of a miracle would permit the masked
figure of the pretender to appear in that
crowded room i thought of entering
then to ascertain if brandon grey load yet
arrived and yet also i wanted to stroll
casually across the street to the coffee
house to make sure that the captain and his
men were there in readiness i had de-
cided to do the latter had already taken a
few steps in that direction when someone
called from the doorway for us all to en-
ter

  i desired a station at the door where-
fore i permitted the others who had been
outside to enter ahead of me they
crowded into the room and lacking seating
space took up positions along the walls
nowhere could i see the face or figure of
my friend as i stepped across the thresh-
old a man with whose face i was unfa-
miliar entered from a little door and
paused just within it

  homage to our sidna mulai moham-
med he announced

  instantly those who were seated rose to
their feet silence fell i saw only the
backs of heads the faces were all toward
the open door behind the man who had
made the announcement for a brief mo-
ment i think i failed to comprehend what
had been said i must have stared stu-
pidly at the door i remember wonder-
ing what kind of a joke the fellow was
playing upon us

  and then into the room strode the
masked figure there was a mutter of
blessing from the throng and deep obei-
sance i gasped consternation seized
and shook me it was unbelievable but
true unless my eyes lied to me for a
breath or two i was panic stricken some-
thing untoward had happened and fears
barbary blood

came tumbling upon me if mulai mo-
hammed had made his escape from the
bashas residence where was grey he
must have been overcome the basha
might even now be approaching with a
force of followers was grey alive and
if so where was he dead were the
captain of the garrison and his men really
in the coffee house ready to come to my as-
sistance at my signal and when should
i give it the word as to the time was
to have been given me by grey the right
hand raised with first and second fingers
extended should i take my chances now
give the signal which would bring the sol-
diers or-

  i had been so occupied in my problem
that i had not heard the sound of hurriedly
approaching footsteps but now i real-
ized that two men pushed past me that
they were breathing deeply as from run-
ning i darted a glance at them and saw
that one of them was belabbas even as
i perceived this-realized the added dan-
ger- heard the voice of the masked man

  all are here it questioned the
twenty-nine chiefs have come

  all sidna all are here replied some-
one

  and the followers continued the
masked man they are gathered outside
the fahssi gate as was arranged

  yes sidna yes--yes a dozen
voices answered

  that is well said mulai mohammed
it required only a moment for this to
take place during that moment i stared at
the masked figure my thoughts in tur-
moil the crisis had arrived but bran-
don grey had not i must give the signal
which would summon the captain and his
men i moved my hand stealthily under
my djcllaba to grasp the pistol with which
to signal the voice of the masked man
continued

  the first thing to be done of course
is to overpower the guard at the gate and
let your men enter after that-

t that moment my
uncovered eye must
have popped for the
masked pretender a s
he spoke and apparent-
ly merely as a gesture
of emphasis had raised
his right hand with the
first and second fingers extended the oth-
ers folded into the palm there are some
things which the mind at first flatly re-
fuses despite the senses



  a coincidence something shouted in
my head but impossible came another
mental shout and then i saw that the
masked man having lowered his right arm
but speaking still had again raised it with
the fingers as before

   i desire oh sidna boomed the voice
of belabbas then to see again the sacred
birthmark upon your breast

   it is permitted for you to look again
upon the mark he bared his left breast
exposing the hand shaped crimson symbol

  a mutter of awe tittilated through the
crowd

  art satisfied sidi belabbas there
was a lash in the question

  yes sidna i-i meant not that
stammered belabbas thou art indeed
the son of mulai el-hassan and our right-
ful lord and master he made obei-
sance

  and then again the masked mans right
hand rose with two fingers outstretched-
and he laughed

   i am glad of that belabbas he said
glad indeed that you are satisfied

  with his left hand he tore away the
mask-my forefinger sent two shots crash-
ing into the night-while i stared at the
laughing face of brandon grey

  as the two shots from my pistol echoed
through the deserted streets i became
aware of two activities the coffee house
faintly discernible now in the quickening
false dawn began to spew forth running
men within the room brandon grey had
drawn a pistol and before the paralyzed
crowd had sensed the turn of events he
had leaped past belabbas and to me

  there is no way out the back he
said hold them here and so side by
side with level pistols we held the now en-
lightened and angry crowd at bay even
against the wild urgings of belabbas

   the captain now added his pistol to ours
and looking over my shoulder i perceived
that his men three score of them at least
i judged had formed a double ranked line
from the doorway to the coffee house

  let them come now as they will he
said to grey

  but i should prefer that you handle
this matter now captain said grey

   good then returned the officer and
raising his voice commanded those within
the room to come out the game was up
and most of the conspirators were aware
of that fact one or two at a time they
came out meekly enough were passed
through the lane of soldiers to the coffee
house


frontier stories

   there are those who will see that they
are securely tied explained the captain
our prison will be full tonight that
makes twenty-live so far

  there are a few others then said
grey in the back room including bel-
abbas

   let us go after them suggested the
captain and  the suggestion we moved
into the now empty front room but we
had not taken half a dozen steps before
the little door was hung open and four
men belabbas at their head with a knife
in either hand rushed forth it came as
a surprise to us took us off our guard in a
way just as will the sudden opening of a
door when one is near to it i chanced to
be between grey and the captain and it
was therefore i who met the force of bel-
abbas charge i fired even as the big bulk
struck me then i felt myself toppled over
saw belabbas leap through the doorway
one man i saw lay sprawled at the feet
of the captain the two others were
wheeling about trying to use their knives
grey and the captain called upon them to
surrender

  never they cried better to die
here

   very well then growled the captain
you shall have what you want his
pistol crashed twice the two natives spun
about unsteadily like tops running down
and fell

  on the instant grey turned and leaped
through the door after belabbas i fol-
lowed him there came the sound of
rifles soldiers were firing at a white figure
fleeing down the street but their bullets
went wild

  take your men now to the fez gate
grey called to the captain and disperse
those ignorant fools who are gathered
there do not harm them they have
been misled he set off at a run after
belabbas and i with him i heard the
captain giving swift orders to his men
heard them falling into ranks and march-
ing off as we ran

  where i wondered was belabbas mak-
ing for he was leading toward the fez
gate i noticed possibly he thought to be
able to escape through the guards to have
the door opened to find sanctuary among
the foolish followers of the false mulai
mohammed outside the gates and surely
enough we drew closer and closer to the
portal but abruptly belabbas who had a
hundred yards start of us dodged off into
a side street when we reached and en-
tered it we saw at a little distance an open

double doorway saw the cobbles of a
courtyard within and on the instant
there came the sudden crash of horses
hoofs and belabbas dashed forth swung
his horse about and made off the sparks
flying from the animals iron shoes both
of us fired at the fleeing figure but the
devil himself seemed to be protecting bel-
abbas this day wherefore we ceased
shooting and ran to the counyard

  we are in luck cried grey here
are other horses

wiftly wc mounted
and followed the sound
made by the feet of
 belabbas horse upon
the cobbled streets it
was a mad chase and a
dangerous one t h e
streets of arzila were
not made for rapid travel it led us across 
the town to the big north gate the doors
of the gate were closed i saw as we came 
within seeing distance but i could also see j
the white mounted figure of belabbas and
the darker figures of the guards

   stop that man shouted grey in the j
name of the sultan 

   but even as he shouted the gates swung j
open i saw the scatter of sparks as belab- j
has horse responded to the spur the i
man we pursued had gained the long white 
beach which stretches from arzila north- j
ward

   as we raced through the gate i saw die j
stupid faces of the guards with open 
mouths and eyes distended but they of-
fered no impediment to our passage and j
so we too gained the beach and saw ahead 
of us less than a hundred yards now the 
fleeing horseman

  it was a contest now between horse-
flesh the mount which grey bestrode j
was bigger and swifter than mine i ne-
cessarily fell behind a little i maintained
my distance with belabbas but grey
gained somewhat and continued to gain

a quarter of a mile was flung behind us
and he had cut in half the distance from
belabbas another quarter of a mile and
although i was yet almost a hundred yards
behind i saw that grey was riding scarce
a dozen feet behind the moor why i
wondered did he not shoot he could
scarcely miss at that short distance i did
not know then as i learned later that my
friend had determined to capture belabbas
alive but in a few moments more i wit-
nessed a startling thing
barbary blood

  the head of greys horse was at the tail
of belabbas the moor was hunched
forward over the saddle i saw grey
strike home the spurs saw his horse leap
alongside that of the moor on the right
side and then i saw grey kick his right
foot free of the stirrup throw that leg over
the horses neck and leap through the air
to descend upon the crouching figure of
belabbas the next moment the two of
them plunged from the beast as it reared
at the impact and fell upon the sand

  i watched the struggle as i raced toward
it grey had fallen underneath but in-
stantly had thrown the moor from on top
of him and reversed the position i saw
a knife go flashing through the air i saw
brandon greys right arm throw back and
i was near enough now to hear the impact
of a blow when i swung from saddle
brandon grey had risen and belabbas was
lying unconscious at his feet

  a noon sun saw kaid wazzani captain
of the garrison marching off toward fez
with his prisoners under heavy guard saw
us riding forth for tangier with the sen-
orita valdez between us the town was
quiet it had awakened to find its revolu-
tion fizzled took the matter philosophi-
cally as an affair passed and done for and
went about its business the ignorant
countrymen who had gathered at their
headmens orders outside the city gates to
wait until the portal should be thrown open
to them for the seizure of the town had
had the real identity of the so-called mu-
lai mohammed revealed to them by the
basha himself at greys orders and there-
upon had faded swiftly away across the
plains sunset saw us in tangier with-
out untoward incident saw the senorita
placed in the hands of the spanish consul-
ate after which with sighs of relief we
reached greys house on the marshan and
sought much needed rest and rest well
deserved also perhaps the plot would
not have hurled the sultan from his throne
but still i think it had a reasonable chance
of success and so i felt that we might
properly take unto ourselves a little credit
for the making of history

  or was the history really made by the
little red spider not much bigger than a
pinhead which had bitten benjamin

by eugene cunningham

author of beginners luck the hermit of tigerhead butte etc

a bullet six inches from his head learned wares kid that he was warmer in
his search for the killer of eph carson but even then he did not suspect how
soon he was to reach the surprising end of the long trail

  readiness of sleek brown winchester stock
  to his hand was not readily apparent too
  he was obviously no more than eighteen or
  nineteen years old

    on the main street wares kid pulled
  up this time to stare broodingly up the
  shallow canyon of brick and wooden build-
  ings almost as if he expected to see dell
  spreen-a small deadly figure of smooth
  fierce brown face and murderous black
  eyes-step from a doorway

    a drowsy idler upon a saloon porch
  leaning comfortably against a post with
  feet in the dust of the street promised in-
  formation wares kid spurred over and
  at sound of the stallions feet the lank one
  opened his eyes lazily

    sherfts office inquired wares kid
  politely

  git to hell out o here an find out if
  you-alls so curus snarled the loafer
  sherffs office repeated wares kid
  finding icy greenish eyes boring into his
  face eyes lit by an uncanny electric sparkl-
  ing the loafer sat suddenly stiff-backed

     scuse me he cried shakily but i
  -i shore thought you-all was a greaser

  yo clothes an yo-yo-

    wares kid ignored the profuse flow of
  apologies having received his directions
  he rode on the lounger mopped damp
  brow with a sleeve and peered after the tall
  black and its small rider

	j

ares kid jogged into
dallas coming from
austin pursuant to spe-
cial orders of the adju-
tant general which cov-
ered the proposed cap-
ture or burial of one
dell spreen who was
charged with murder and robbery down
el paso way

  horsemen passed him farmers in wag-
ons with their families about them all
gave the smallish figure on the black stal-
lion a more than usually curious glance
he was dressed like a mexican dandy-a
huge black sombrero heavy with silver
bullion shading a lean brown face and
sun-narrowed gray-green eyes a waist-
length jumper of soft tanned goatskin
fringed from shoulder to elbow and with
a bouquet of scarlet roses embroidered
upon the back pantaloncs of blue with
rows of twinkling silver buttons on each
side of the crimson insert in the outer
seam some of those who passed him
would have instantly recognized his name
for he had wiped out black alec rawless
gang two years before and so had marked
his entry into the rangers the tale was
a classic over a wide land

  but the crowd passed on unwittingly
for his white-handled colt hung awk-
wardly high upon his belt and the canny
wanted

  gawd hes a mean n i bet you 
he said gent what packs a six-shooter
but reaches fer his carbeen when hes riled
-i bet you hes a wolf v	i

  wares kid swung down before the
sheriffs office and hitched the stallion to
a splintered post with carbine cuddled in
his arm he crossed to stand in the door-
way of the office his roving eyes made
out in the duskiest corner a small figure
squatting against the wall	

  wares kid went inside the squatting
one was a boy of fifteen barefooted in
faded overalls gingham shirt and ragged
hat upon towv hair his round eyes were
of the palest blue and he had neither brows
nor lashes so that his gaze seemed un-
winking like a snakes

  sherff grunted wares kid

  the boy jerked his head toward the
street door and shrugged silently wares
kid after a long stare lounged over to
another corner and himself squatted upon
his heels	i

  presently he forgot the boy in the op-
posite corner slowly he produced dur-
ham and brown papers and methodically
built a cigarette this he laid upon the
floor before him and rolled another then a
third fourth fifth sixth they laid in a
neat row he picked up one from the end
of the row and lit it

  he wondered if he were really to find
dell spreen here in dallas he had not
been in carwell with sergeant ames on
the day three months past when simeon
rutter and two o-bar riders had spurred
into the tiny sleepy village with the word
of the murder and robbery of eph car-
son rutters partner

  but the sour-faced ranger sergeant had
told him of the crime and of his investiga-
tions at el castillo the long low rock-
wall from behind which eph carson had
been shot

iecing together the
testimony of rutter
and the punchers and
adding the result of his
own observation ames
had made a fairly com-
plete story carson had
been on his way back
to the o-bar with about seven thousand
dollars of his and rutters money during
his absence up crow point way this gun-
man spreen had ridden up to the o-bar
and asked for carson told that he was
absent spreen had said grimly that he
would wait

-r	

  but shortly after breakfast on the day
of the murder while the ranch house was
deserted except for two mex cooks
spreen had disappeared none had since
seen him spreen knew that carson was
to return with a large sum of money the
whole ranch had known it

 evidently said ames spreen had rid-
den up the crow point trail to ambush
himself where it ran along the rock wall
in the desert-el castillo he had not
waited long-there were but two cigarette
stubs in the trampled sand eph carson
had come squarely into range of the
steadied rifle then-two shots and the
wizened little cowman had side-slipped
from the saddle to sprawl face downward
dead having robbed the body spreen
had vanished as if the ground had swal-
lowed him

  wares kid went over the details of his
own investigation he had located the
niche in the wall which had held the mur-
derers  rifle he had re-created the
murder had interviewed rutter and the
o-bar boys

  the dark bitter-tongued rancher had
told how he had ridden with the punchers
up the trail toward crow point when
carsons failure to return had alarmed
him told how they had found carson
sprawled upon the sand found his horse
a quarter-mile away with bridle reins
caught in the ocotillos

  two weeks after the murder a peremp-
tory summons had come to wares kid
from headquarters in austin he had
found the adjutant general determined to
stamp out the wave of crime then sweep-
ing the border country he wanted this
spreen killed or taken preferably the
latter that he might be hanged upon the
scene of his crime

  you wiped out black alecs gang the
adjutant general had said to wares kid
so im giving you this commission get
dell spreen  i dont care where you have
to go to get him either

  wares kid who was now smoking the
fifth cigarette from his layout was aroused
from his thoughts by footsteps a stocky
man clumped inside the office and sat down
at the battered desk

  mawnin nodded the stocky man the
rigidity of his angubr face was broken up
by curiosity as wiue alert brown eyes
roved over the mexican finery some-
thin

  do know shrugged wares kid

  he noted that the man wore a deputy
sheriffs badge upon his open vest he

was perhaps twenty-nine or thirty though
dark mustache and tiny goatee made him
seem older he was dusty as from long
riding now he reached down stiffly and
took off his spurs

  do know repeated wares kid
sherff

  sheriffs up to austin a-powwowin

chief depty-hes ramblin round the el-

bass

  mention of the notorious outlaw who
was just then keeping rangers and peace
officers frantic solved a part of wares
kids puzzle he had been wondering
whether or not to take the local officers
into his confidence tell them frankly whom
he sought

  he decided to forego any help these
easterners could give in locating spreen-
an east texas man and perhaps one
known to them-to gain the greater ad-
vantage of working without danger of
warning being passed to spreen by some
friend

  kind o interested in bass he told the
deputy thoughtfully ranger head-
quarters troop names ware

  ware cried the deputy staring hard
and somewhat unbelievingly heerd
about you-ali glad to meet you

  he shook hands and sat down again
still eyeing wrares kid doubtfully then
the boy in the corner came silently to the
desk the deputy nodded to him hesi-
tated and turned to wares kid

  mind if i talk to him private he
asked apologetically

  wares kid went outside to lean against
the wall he could hear the boys excited
whispering an occasional explosive grunt
from the deputy then he was called in-
side the boy was gone

  the deputy sat scowling down at the
desk tap-tapping the curving black butt
of the long-barreled colt at his hip he
glanced up at wares kid with the odd
appraising stare he had given the small
figure at first mention of his name

  my names bos johnson he remarked
abruptly you-all make yosef to home
here ill be back right soon

  he was gone fifteen or twenty minutes
and when he came in again his face wore
that expression of grim rigidity which
wares kid had marked upon him when
first he had come into the office

  aright he grunted les git yo
hawse to the stable then ill buy you-all
a drink

  they saw to the stallions stabling then
crossed the street to a low brick saloon
there were not many in it-a cowboy or
two a knot of farmers standing together
far down the bar but drinking alone
was a huge man with sullen red face and
close-set black eyes he turned at the
pairs entrance staring

  whisky said bos johnson tonelessly
wares kid nodded agreement

he big man watched
tugging at long mus-
taches and snorting
loudly as if at his pri-
vate thoughts he
watched belligerently
while the bartender
poured the drinks for
wares kid and bos johnson

  bartender he bellowed suddenly and
crashed a huge fist upon the polished bar

  yes sir replied the bartender his
pastv face was gray-hued yes sir
you-all know who i am bartender
i ask you-all-don you-all know what i
am huh

  yes sir mr branch course i do
everybody knows bull branch so do
bull branch continued to glare menac-
ingly at him

  bartender he growled since when
is mexicans lowed to come a-shovin in
yere a-drinkin with white men you-all
git down there an take that-ere drink
away from that mex then you-all chase
him outn here fore i git mad

  slowly the bartender inched toward
wares kid-who had not yet seemed
even to glance in bull branchs direction
when he was still six feet away the
ranger turned his head a trifle-and re-
garded the bartender the unhappy man
stopped instantly shrinking back before
the uncanny electric sparkling in the gray-
green eyes slowly then wares kid
wheeled to face bull branch

  where i come from- thus the ran-
ger in a soft drawl-ever gent kills his
own snakes

  what roared bull branch lowering
big head on bull neck and glaring feroc-
iously ivhut

  pop yo whip fella wares kid in-
vited him still in the bored drawl

  bull branch gaped amazedly deliber-
ately he pushed back his coat flaps and put
huge hands upon his hips the pearl-
gripped butts of two colts showed almost
under his fingers then he bore slowly
down upon the ranger who stood sideway
wanted

to the bar with left elbow resting on its
edge bos johnson moved unobtrusively
away from the bar and out ot possible line
of fire but bull branch made no move
to draw his guns merely came on ponder-
ously

  what followed was blurred like the ac-
tion of a rattlers head as it strikes the
left hand of wares kid moved-so rap-
idly that none there actually saw it move

it caught up the whisky glass from the bar
and flipped the stinging liquor squarely
into bull branchs face

  as the huge figure reeled hands going
to tortured eyes wares kid shot forward
he twitched branchs colts from their
holsters and hurled them into a corner
he rained blows upon bull branchs face
-leaping clear off the floor to reach that
height

  it was cat-and-mastiff blindly bull
branch tried to push him off but those
hard fists landing with force terrifically
out of proportion to the small body behind
them cut his face to ribbons closed his
eves to puffy-lidded slits drove sicken-
ingly into his mid-section he staggered
about the barroom grunting whining
helpless at last some instinct seemed to
show him the door he broke for it at
a staggering run and wares kid with a
comanche yell leaped upon his back and
spurred him through it catching hold of
the lintel and swinging down to the floor
as bull branch lurched through and fell
sprawling upon the veranda floor outside

  when he came back the bartender was
half-crouched against the back-bar with
eyes bulging bos johnson and the other
patrons were clinging to the bar some
whooping feebly others too weak to do
more than shed happy tears bos johnson
waggled a hand at the bartender

  set em up bartender he gasped
this ns on the house ware mebbe
they wont neveh hist no monument to
you-all here but bull branch-hell re-
membeh you-all plenty

ack in the sheriffs
office johnson turned
suddenly serious again
he sat staring at the
wall his harsh face
rigid as if set in bronze

  i got you-all into
that trouble with bull
branch johnson said suddenly done
it a-purpose

  wares kid merely waited brown face

gray-green eyes revealing nothing of his
thoughts

  wondered if you-all really was ware
an if you was how much o thetalk was
so because-i shore do need some help
fer what

  lto go out with me tonight an stand up
to sam basss gang

  wares kid studied the grimly earnest
face from the beginning he had sensed
something unusual about him he thought
that johnson was usually a happy-go-lucky
cowpuncher and a man efficient with either
hands or weapons he was used to judg-
ing men quickly and he began to like this
stocky deputy

  a right he grunted curtly

  you-all willin cried johnson then
here s the layout theyre goin to stick
up the east-bound t c p agin at eagle
ford figger folks wont be expectin
lightnin to hit twict in the same place

texan blood understood his willingness to
take a hundred-to-one chance to face his
enemy more and more he liked bos
johnson

  a right well hunt em up he

frontier stories

   wares kid stared silently at johnson

  whats name that other little station-
east o here  he asked

   mesquite 

  didnt even know there was one
shrugged wares kid with a ghost of a
grin johnson well be at mesquite not
eagle ford tonight boys lyin in with
bass likely feelin i got an mostly my
feelins is right

  johnson was won over to acceptance of
the altered plan if but half-willingly he
admitted that he knew nothing much of
the boy who had appeared in the office a
month before offering to spy upon the bass
gang

  in with bass repeated the ranger
hell he couldve brought yuh lots o
news fore this

hey waited until nearly
dark then ate at a
chinese restaurant it
was pitch-dark when
they went swiftly to
the stable where john-
sons horse with the
big stallion had been
fed an hour before they saddled talk-
ing a little for the benefit of any ears that
might be stretched toward them of the
western road that toward eagle ford

  for a couple of miles they rode swiftly
eastward then turned south on the road
to mesquite they were close to the rail-
road always riding through woodland
johnson led because of his knowledge of
the country soon he checked his mount
and jerked the winchester from its scab-
bard wares kid already cuddled his car-
bine in the crook of his arm they rode
on again slower now

  suddenly not fifty yards ahead a man
scratched a match the ranger jerked his
carbine up gently he kneed the stallion
around feeling rather than seeing that
johnson was doing likewise there was
no alarm while they moved back a hundred
yards and slipped off their animals

  lets hitch the hawses an sneak up
whispered johnson

  they returned to the point from which
they had seen the flare of that match the
stocky deputy making no more sound than
a shadow-than the ranger himself then
they halted squatting on their heels to
listen there was the sound of men mov-
ing of horses the hum of low-voiced
jerky conversation

   late again a boyish voice complained
hell youd think we were passengers

sarn way the dam railroads treating us
don t ye fret bub a harsh voice an-
swered the youngster shell be a-rambl-
in along right soon ingineer hell see
that log an hell jerk her back onto her
tail right suddent

  everbody lined up inquired a pleas-
ant voice-basss wares kid surmised
yuh-all know where yuh work

  as the voices answered in affirmative
grunts the ranger began moving sound-
lessly to circle them to get nearer to the 
point where the train would stop john- 
son followed until they were squatting in
a little open perhaps fifty feet from the 
track sheltered by a fallen tree

  you-all was shore right breathed 
johnson wouldnt be nowheres else in i
the world

  minutes ticked off then there was the f
sound of the train far away the rails j
before them began to hum the train j
was upon robbers and officers with a roar i
came a frantic squealing of brakes and j
the scream of the whistle

  the train had barely halted when there 
was a rattle of shots along the track it 
was so dark that there was no clue to the j
robbers positions save the orange flames 
that stab-stabbed the night wares kid j
was conscious that johnson was gone from i
beside him he wasted no time thinking 
of that but ran crouched over up to the j
track where he could fire at the robbers
shot-flashes from here he went into ac-
tion with coldly precise fire from the car- 
bine

  whos that dam jughead someone
roared evidently thought wares kid 
he was believed to be some misguided
member of the gang firing into his own
people

  from between the cars came shots to j
answer the gang now it was pandem- j
monium there in the pitchy night with the
heavy roar of colts and the sharp whip-
like reports of rifles a man could but j
guess by the relative positions of the
flashes at whom he shot

  the ranger hardly expected to do much 
execution-his position made that a matter
of chance but he was worrying the bass
men

suddenly a tiigh clear voice rang out
crying a name over and over again pene- 
trating even the staccato din of the firing j
simp dunbar where you-all  simp

dunbar-

a voice answered but there was no
diminution in the firing wares kid
crawled down the track having reloaded
wanted

his carbinc with his first shot a man
cried out shrilly he pumped the lever
and-his carbine jammed he spat a bit-
ter curse he knew instantly what had
happened-he had slipped a  pistol cart-
ridge into a  carbine

  a huge shape hurled itself at him me-
chanically he threw up his carbine and the
oncoming man ran into it then wares
kid tugging at the butt of his seldom-
used colt leaped aside a roar sounded
almost in his ear then a hand caught his
shoulder instinctively he stepped close to
his assailant turned like a flash when a
pistol brushed him dropped his colt and
caught the fellows gtmhand with both of
his and hung on grimly

  somethins wrong boys lets git out
o yere a cool hrif-laughing voice was
shouting down the track-not the voice
which had called simp dunbars name

  the fellow with whom wares kid
grappled was swinging terrific blows at
his lighter opponent but the rangers
head was against his chest the big fel-
lows fists but grazed their mark but he
was tiring with his bulldog grip on the
others gunhand suddenly he released his
hold and tried to leap backward a heel
caught on a bunch of grass and he stum-
bled a flash and roar from in front of
him a stinging pain across his head he
crashed flat

e came to conscious
of a dull headache and
next of a dim light
over his head after a
moment of blinking he
perceived that he was
sitting in a chair of a
railway coach next
he realized that the train was moving

  how d you-all feel now inquired
an anxious voice

  painfully he turned his head and saw
bos johnsons worried face opposite him

  right puny he grunted truthfully

  johnson grinned widely relief in his
brown eyes

  what happened demanded wares
kid

  bullet creased you-all you-all been
pickin daisies might nigh a hour

  the hell where we goin gang git

  goin into dallas yeh gang high-
tailed it-all but simp dunbar said john-

right up i snuck up onto him an told

nel of his shirt beneath it showed a great
hole with charred edges

  might nigh got me first crack but
i worked buttonholes up an down his
front fore he could shoot agin

pin right on top me-an me with an empty
gun  i yelled like a comanche an damned

  wares kid eyed him steadily he knew
that only johnsons arrival had kept his
assailant from putting another bullet into
him as he lay unconscious

  he leaned back wearily in the seat john-
son stretched his bowed legs comfortably
and took off his stetson

  wisht i had a chaw he grumbled
got the makins wares kid fum-
bled in his jumper pocket

  dont use her thet-a-wav i neveh
could learn to smoke some way

  he threw his head back and closed his
eyes and the ranger watching him
turned suddenly cold all over for upon
the brown sinewy neck that had been al-
ways hidden heretofore by the silken neck-
erchief shone a long white scar that
stretched evenly three quarters of the way
around it

  a stocky dark-faced dark-ej-ed man
with a white scar circling evenly around
his neck-so simeon rutter and the o-bar
hands had described dell spreen true
they had seen him clean-shaven and be-
lieving him guilty of murder they remem-
bered his features and eyes as murderous
but there was no doubt about it-dell
spreen sat there across from him with
closed eyes and to dell spreen he owed
his life that night

  dell spreen he call in a low voice
bos johnson moved like a cat to half-
draw his colt then he saw the derringer
that covered him with twin barrels for
an instant he hesitated then shoved the
colt back into its holster and slumped

  so you-all come afteh me he said
i been lookin fer somebody to show up
thats why i got me a job as depty fig-
gered whoever comed spill his tale in the
office an seein me wearin a badge

  then the old surge of hope died of
course johnson would say that

  slowly the ranger shook his head

high cloud o dust

  wares kid slumped lower in the seat

  going over and over his mental picture of
the scene of the crime

  bos johnson rose to cup his hands
against the window glass and jeer out into
the night missing no slightest movement
of hisprisoner the ranger studied again
the wide powerful shoulders the bandy
legs of the man who has ridden almost
since birth johnson turned slowly

    dallas be in soon he said then
-i aint blamin you-all none ware but
just-well sort o between us i wisht i
could make you believe i never done it i

sor  j yua from the beginnin
an-

   t aint a bit o use interrupted
wares kid

  a tiny smile was born far back in the
gray-green eyes seemed to spread over
the habitually blank brown face and come
finally to rest upon the thin-lipped mouth

  t aint a bit o use he repeated
 cause-i know yuh never done it
ostentatiously he returned the derringer
to his jumper pocket

   s all right bos yuh got to go down
to austin with me got to ex-hibit yuh
some to the adjtant ginral to make him
sabe but thatll be all listen i went
snoopin around some myself down at

tant ginral then im goin to ask him
to let me go back to carwell to find the
fella that really done the killin hell let
me go an-
wanted -



  ft he docs cried bos johnson very
earnestly man thes shore some six-
footehs down in that carwell country asll y
be up in the air two ways to onct

p out of the glaring
yellow sand the long 
low narrow barrier of
black rock jutted ab-
ruptly el castillo
-the castle the mex- 
icans had named it 
long ago the name
fitted as well as such names usually do 
actually it more resembled a stone fence
fifty yards long which in height varied 
from three to ten feet and in thickness
from a foot to four even five feet the 
top was jagged-sharp saw teeth of slick
inky rock a sinister pile even in the
white sunlight of a desert forenoon

  wares kid squatted -on spurred heels
at the castles western end where the trail
forked to run on either side of the wall
not much of a trail this--the deep loose
perpetually-drifting sand soon effaced im-
pressions  but generations of travel had
made a lane between walls of greasewood
and cat-claw and cactus

  it was near the rangers position on
this dimly-marked track that eph carson
had died-shot from the saddle without a
chance to return the murderers fire

  having left dell spreen in the care of
the adjutant general in austin and re-
turned swiftly to carwell wares kid had
come without being observed to the scene
of the murder now that he knew spreen
had not committed the killing he must de-
cide who did

  satisfied the adjtant ginral spreen
neveh done it reflected the ranger but
i got to figure out who did spreens too
little good-size hombre plugged eph
carson

  he got up and the great black stallion
which had stood behind him as he squatted
now followed like a dog to the spot where
eph carsons murderer had lain in wait
wares kid knew the place well

  fella leaned up aginst the rock right
here he re-enacted the scene mentally
lined his sights on carson carson was
cornin up t other side from over crow
point way fella drilled him plumb cen-
ter went out an took seven thousand
out o carsons saddle bags stood right
here standin on the ground no hawss-
tracks closern that cat-claw yonder good
size fella had to be to rest his rifle in
that crotch

  mechanically he studied the rock wall
and the sand that swept away from its
foot something bright in the sand in
he very spot where they had found the
murderers tracks he stooped but it
was only a glassy bit of rock he held it
staring absently his mind upon the mys-
tery from the little sand dunes behind
him to northward came the flat vicious
report of a rifle a bullet slapped the
rock wall almost in his face it had passed
within six inches of his head instantly
another followed

  wares kid moved like a rattler strik-
ing he moved automatically but with a
precision an economy of movement that
could not have been bettered by rehearsals
times without number he was sheltered
from the bullets within two steps stand-
ing behind his stallions bulk his hand
slapped the saddle horn he was in the
saddle without touching stirrups and lying
flat upon the blacks neck the great
rowels dug the stallions flanks he
surged forward magnificently within two
strides he was galloping the ranger
chased by bullets that buzzed spitefully
about his ears swung the black around the
end of the castle

  half-way down the length of the stone
wall he slid the stallion to a halt here
was a place where he could peer across the
top between two teeth of rock his great
sombrero hung down his back bv the chin-
strap from the scabbard beneath the left
fender had leaped a sleek winchester car-
bine he cuddled the carbine in the crook
of his arm as with green-gray eyes squint-
ing coldly he studied the sand dunes be-
hind which his antagonist lay hidden

  a thin smoke-cloud was drifting upward
above the dunes wares kid rested the
carbine in the crotch of the wall-top he
sighted carefully and drove three -s to
dust along the crest of the dunes some
fifteen inches apart instantly the other
rifleman replied with a rolling quartette of
bullets that bunched most efficiently be-
neath the rangers carbine-muzzle

  he watched narrowly without replying
in kind at last he shrugged and whirled
the stallion to ride off south and east to-
ward the o-bar ranch-house

  he could have stalked the sand dunes
from which the unknown bushwhacker had
fired there was cover of a sort up to the
very base of the dunes but the ambush-
ers fire had been entirely too craftsman-
like too nearly deadly to make the pros-
pect of scaling the low slope before him
seem anything but the brief prebminary


frontier stories

to a funeral wares kid preferred to
ride off with a whole skin and calculate
upon another meeting under conditions
more equal they said of him in the
rangers that for a youngster no more
than nineteen he had a mighty level head

  a half-mile perhaps he galloped with-
out turning then reaching for the field
glasses he checked the stallion far be-
hind him a horseman streaked it eastward
the ranger studied rider and brown horse
through the glasses

  mebbe hes tall he grunted at last
but-mebbe hes just a-forkin a little
pony

or ten miles he kept the
stallion at a mile-eating
running walk he had
never been at the o-bar
house but he knew its
location from hearsay
and so when the black
began climbing a steady
incline studded by boulders and covered
with taller-than-ordinary mesquite he nod-
ded to himself this was the way all
right

  the stallion made the inclines top and
paused for a moment expelling its breath
in a great spiort at the sound the flaxen-
haired girl  the lookout rock turned
sharply she and wares kid stared one
at another her great dark eyes meeting his
narrowed gaze levelly

  howdy he drawled after a-to him
-long and uncomfortable silence he
was always ill at ease with women they
usually wanted a man to make some sort
of damned fool of himself to suit a fem-
inine whim

  good morning she replied still exam-
ining him calmly

  trail to the o-bar he grunted awk-
wardly after another silence

  yes the house is a mile away but
theres nobody there except the cook and
his helper do you want to see my father
sim rutter

  wares kid stared he recalled noth-
ing about a daughter on the o-bar and
that simeon rutter huge gaunt black-
haired black-eyed black-bearded grim and
taciturn should have such a daughter as
this slim fair-skinned creature seemed
somehow unbelievable she seemed to
read his thoughts

  ive been away at school-las cruces
-convent you know she enlightened
but im not going back-i hope

  stay here huh 

  i hope not this is just as bad oh
i hate this bare desolate country dont

you

  dont know shrugged wares kid
lie had never thought about the matter
one way or the other dont know-as i

do

  i want to go back east to new york
-philadelphia-boston-oh all the places
ive read about europe too im trying
to get my father to sell the ranch and go
traveling with me all over the world
ive been trying to persuade him for two
years but i think hell do it now-may-
be his partner was killed you know
hes all broken up over that he doesnt
say much but it was an awful blow just
the same i think hell sell out

  got to be goin grunted wares kid
all this talk of travel was over his head
nor had it anything to do with his partic-
ular business-the capture of eph car-
sons murderer

  ill ride with you will you get my
horse hes tied to a cat-claw over yon-
der

  the ranger got the ponv and brought it
back he sat his stallion holding her ani-
mals reins she waited for an instant
but he was blind to her expectation that he
would help her into the caddie so she
swung up unaided and jerked the reins
from his hand

  as they rode almost stirrup-to-stlrrup
toward the ranch-house wares kid stud-
ied her covertly from beneath half-lowered
sombrero brim it dawned upon him sud-
denly that not yet had he seen her smile
the large blue eves were somber always
she seemed to brood upon something they
rode in silence until a half-mile or so
ahead the clutter of buildings with con-
stituted the o-bar holding showed against
the desert shrubbery

  i hate it she burst out oh how i
hate it

  then they rode on silently again the
creak of saddle-leather the scuffing of the
animals hoofs the only sound until they
dismounted in the ranch yard

  there was but one horse in the cotton-
wood-log corral a black gelding as large
as the mount of wares kid the girl
glanced at it then toward the house

  my fathers home she said tonelessly
come in

  they went around the house and upon
the rough veranda that shaded its front
found simeon rutter with feet cocked
upon the rail big shaggy head upon his
chest he looked up at the sound of their
wanted -f



footsteps and sun-narrowed black eyes
softened amazingly as he saw his daughter

  hello baby he rumbled wonder-
in where yuh was then to wares kid
howdy kid whatre yuh doin down
here agin  thought they sent yuh up to
austin or some vs

  did but sent me back i got dell
spreen

  yuh did thats shore good hearin
kid he came swiftly to his feet with
great hands hard-clenched

  the girl had gone indoors and bitterly
yet with a certain grim repression simeon
rutter cursed dell spreen

  wheres spreen now he demanded
creaking off suddenly carwell el
paso

  austin lookin up more evidence

  simeon rutter cursed the laws dawdl-
ing ways its coddling of an assassin
wares kid but half-listened he was
thinking of the efficient rifleman of the
morning who had bushwhacked him from
the sand dunes

  how many big men in this country
he asked abruptly big men

  rutter stopped short to stare at him
then he considered the question eyes nar-
rowed thoughtfully

  dont know me o course an curly
gonzales over crow point way lamson
-that crazy puncher on the d--an slim
nichols on the flvin a all i think of
why

  the ranger hesitated knowing rutters
bitterness toward dell spreen he won-
dered if the dour ranchman could be made
to believe his own theory that spreen had
not could not have committed the mur-
der wondered too if rutter would be
silent about the theory

  spreen says he never killed carson
he said slowly

  yeh an what

  an if he did-well i dont know how
he done it

  whatre yuh drivin at yut got the
name o bein leveb-headed kid but-
whatre yuh drivin at

  how could a little fella-littern me-
shoot carson restin his gun in a crotch
near as high as he could reach

  scowling simeon rutter considered this
problem

  that was a high crotch-one that we
found his tracks under he admitted but
hell he was siltin on a hawss or else
standin on somethin not good enough
kid by god not half good enough ix

make me believe dell spreen never shot old
eph carson from hidin o course he de-
nies it spect him to own right up
yeh course hed say he never but
i been thinkin wasnt no hawss-tracks
under the crotch nothin to stand on
nothin we could see anyhow so won-
dered whod be tall enough to shoot out o
that crotch standin on the sand an
too-

  he hesitated for an instant before he
decided to tell of the morning

  an too somebody bushwhacked me
out at the castle today

  bushwhacked yuh what for whod
be a-bushwhackin yuh

  dont know fella on a dun good
shot too purty good that is

  here cried rutter suddenly too
much funny business about this i want
to see that place agin git yo hawss kid
lets take a pasear out to the castle an
look around

  he went swiftly down to the corral and
got the lariat from his saddle the black
gelding retreated to a corner snorting
whirling rutter sent the loop spinning
over its head and hauled the animal to him
by sheer brute force

  so dam many hawsses none gits rid
enough  he rumbled irritably wilder n
antelope all of em

  he saddled swiftly and swung up
wares kid was already mounted they
turned past the front veranda and rutter
waved to his daughter who had come out-
side again he seemed another person
when near her the grim shell of him
cracked and a tenderness odd in a man so
aparently harsh-grained showed for a mo-
ment

  goin out to el castillo he shouted
at the girl back when i git back baby

hey rode silently for
miles rutter was one
after the rangers own
heart taciturn efficient
in his business star-
ing at his companions
broad back wares kid
nodded approval he
thought of what the girl had said-of her
fathers repressed sorrow over his part-
ners death he could understand rutters
vengefulness toward dell spreen but he
hoped before the days end to show the
o-bar ownfer his error to prove that
spreen could not have murdered eph car-

son	 

  if yuhre right about this height busi-
frontier stories

ness rutter growled suddenly i dont
know what were goin to do about it too
long ago now not that im admittm
yuhre right but just in case yuh are
how can we find out where these fellas-
curly gonzales an lamson an nichols-
was that day fella dont always recollect
just what he was doin three months ago

  he whirled sideway in the saddle
that mornin me an august koenig
-one o ray hands-was ridin nawth o

son headin for elizario recollect now
august an lamson come near mixin it
count august he was askin about some
widder that lives in elizario an lamson

  what kind o fellas lamson in-
quired wares kid

  oh sames most gits kind o crazy

time ago by a bronc an once in a while he
flies up but hes a good puncher an i
dont know why anybodyd think hed

ble-seen it fair an square through the
smoke no-o i wouldnt put him down

  yuh found carson right after noon

  yeh i got fidgety him not cornin in
the day i figgered so when me an
august got back to the house an eph

yavapai wiggins an we rode out found
eph long about two oclock lyin in the
trail seven thousand about he was pack-
in all gone

  mostly yos they say

   bout four thousand rutter nodded
gloomily but t wasnt the money riled
me so old eph he never knowed what
hit him never had a chanct nary chanct
to git his six-shooter out like t told yuh
then right after it happened i figgered
dell spreen cause hed hung around the
ranch three days waitin for eph would-
nt tell nobody what he wanted just
looked mean an packed his cantinas an
hightailed it that very mawnin i geth-
ered yuh never found the money on him
fo dollars bout shrugged wares
kid

  they came to the castle and reined in
the animals on the spot where the mur-
derer of eph carson had waited si-
lently simeon rutters stared at the crotch
in the rock wall in which the assassin had
rested his rifle-barrel slowly as unwill-

ing even now to concede weight to the
theory the ranger had advanced tenta-
tively he nodded

   the wasnt no hawss-tracks closern
that cat-claw yonder he admitted

  he swung down and pulled his win-
chester from its scabbard then moved over j
to the crotch in the wall even for one of
his height it was a strain to level the bar- 
rel with butt at shoulder he nodded 
again and set the rifle down from a shirt
pocket he brought durham and papers and
shook tolacco onto the brown leaf somber
black eyes roving

  w ares kid slipped from the saddle and i
came swiftly over to where rutter stood i
he stopped and dug into the sand at the i
ranchers feet then straightened

  whats it asked rutter

  it was a large pearl-handled pocket- 
knife tarnished from much carrying with i
four good blades and one broken blade- i
stump rutter licked his cigarette jam- i
bed it into his mouth and took the knife i
from the rangers hand staring thought- i
fully

  see it before asked wares kid rut- i
ter shook his head

  umm-no reckon not not many like j
that carried in this country but some- j
body ought to know it well ride into j
carwell pretty soon see but right now j
i want to ride eph carsons back-trail 
got a idee mebbe she wont pan out

  they could only guess that eph carson
had come along the regular trail and follow t
through the dim lane between the grease-
wood and cacti they rode silently with 
eyes roving from trail to skyline and back 
again the afternoon wore on evening 
came to westward up-thrusting hills 
jagged fantastic drew nearer

  huecos grunted rutter and wares 
kid nodded he knew this ancient water-
ing place of the desert people red and
brown and white a good many times with
a ranger detachment from ysleta hunting
apache sign he had camped there

  guess we better hole up there t night
rutter grunted staring across the flat to
the beginning of that welter of arroyo-cut
hillocks mawnin we can head back to
carwell an see bout that frogsticker or
we can look over some more trail

  yo idee queried wares kid yuh
said yuh had one

  tell yuh about it come mawnin said
rutter far back in the grim black eyes
lurked a shadowy amusement aint
quite ready to back her up clean to the tail-
ate got anything to eat
wanted 

  dried beef tortillas coffee can o
plums

  dried beef an tortillas is a meal grin-
ned rutter les head for the tanks an
camp

  better hole up in the old butterfield
station counseled wares kid health-
iern sleepin longside the main tinaja 
apaches dont stick no closer to the reser-
vation than ever i reckon

  not so close by god swore rutter
yuhre right kid them dam feather
dusters stops here or at crow springs or
the comudas reglar cornin from mcs-
calero to chihuahua stage station she is
well make it

  they nodded mutual agreement and
spurred the horses on through the dark

at the deserted stage station-a rude
dwelling made by walling in the mouth of
a natural cavern-they swung down the
ranger sniffed like a hunting dog

  some seep water up the canyon a
piece he muttered good enough for
the hawsses but ill take the canteen an
git some real water at the tank for us

e unsaddled the
black scallion and swift-
ly rutter followed his
example rutter got
out the food and coffee
pot from the rangers
saddle bags while the
latter bearing a can-
teen started up the canyon to the main
tank

  wares kid moved silently for all his
high-heeled boots the canyon floor was
of hard-packed earth but studded with
loose stones and he placed his feet care-
fully one never knew who might be
using the tanks from time immemorial
it had been one of the favorite watering
places of this region wild animals and
wild men red and brown and white came
there furtively

  he passed close along the left-hand wall
decorated with indian pictographs and the
names of pioneers and so came to the low
cavern in which was the spring-fed well
or tank more cautiously than ever he
moved now the rock apron before the
cavern was pitted with rxcar-holes where
prehistoric tribes had ground their corn
rude mortars still used by the apaches who
camped there it was tricky footing and
trickier still inside where one approached
the well-lip over a stone floor worn slick
as glass by countless feet

   tnv

  inside the cavern-piouth he squatted for
a moment and listened he heard nothing
from without or within and slid his feet
carefully forward balancing himself with
left hand upon a rounded slab that divided
the cavern in two sections

  so he was awkwardly balanced when a
sinewy arm shot around his throat from
behind and a hough sounded in his ear

  a smallish rather insignificant-seeming
figure was wares kid but all whale-
bone and whang-leather as the rangers
who had wrestled with him remarked
amazedly a hundred and ten pounds of
wiry flashingly quick steel-strong body

  now he moved automatically fairly
shouting indians sideways he whirled
and so the apaches knife went wide in its
downward drive back shot the rangers
head to smash into the indians face it
broke his strangling hold and wares kid
turning half in air his feet were sliding
so shot a vicious fist into the apaches
midriff then had the buck by the throat
and was gripping him about the body with
legs closing like scissor-blades and fending
off flailing arms with elbows spread

  the apache was powerful but before
he had much opportunity to struggle
wares kid had banged his back-head
against the rock he managed a long
loud gasping groan feebly his knife-
hand rose the ranger loosed the throat
for an instant and fumbled fer the wea-
pon it sliced his palm then he seized it
and buried it in the indians body

  when the apache was limp-wise men
made very sure that apaches were really
dead-the ranger stood up shakily and
groped for the entrance a stone slid
down into the canyon and he hurled him-
self forward out of the cavern as he
gained the middle of the canyon running
like a quarter-horse there was thud after
thud of feet dropping from the rocks to
the hard ground

  he ran on his toes hoping that he could
make camp sufficiently ahead of these fleet
indians to warn rutter hoping too that
rutter had the horses together had not
taken them out onto the flat to graze he
ran as he never had run in his life

  at last he sensed the camp just ahead
and from it came a rifle-shot then an-
other the bullets sang past him peril-
ously close

  its-wares kid he gasped in-
juns-cornin

  thought ytih was one of em  grunted
rutter with no particular alarm evident in
his heavy voice how close


frontier stories

  right behind no time to saddle
  fork em bareback

   he paused only to snatch his precious
carbine from its scabbard on the saddle
then scooped up the bight of the lariat
with which the stallion was picketed he
vaulted upon the stallions back muffled
sound in the darkness nearby told that
rutter was following his example

  up the canyon the darkness was sud-
denly punctuated in a half-dozen places by
orange flames bullets thudded into the
ground into rock walls around the white
men the firing was a continuous roll its
rumbling multiplied by the canyon walls
as usual the apaches had rifles as good
as any in that country better than those
of the army rutter swore venomously

   wares kid had slashed the lariat with
his belt knife rutter apparently had
done the same for when the black stal-
lion surged ahead toward the safety of
the open land rutter was close behind
they galloped furiously for perhaps half
an hour the moon came out and flooded
the desert with a white light that re-
minded the ranger of billy conants new
fashion saloon in el paso when the elec-
tric lightsxvere turned on

   being tighter and perhaps the better
rider wares kid led he had lost a hun-
dred dollar saddle but he was phlegmatic
about that it was all in the game they
were lucky-he especially-to be riding
away with their hair a sudden groan
from rutter aroused him from his thoughts
and he looked backward under his arm in
time to see the big man slide sideways off
his gelding and roll over upon his side

echanically
wares kid whirled the
stallion and glared half-
a-dozen ways at once
in search of the assas-
sin but the broad ex-
panse of greasewood
and cacti lay quiet in
the incandenscent moonlight so he rode
back to rutter and slid to the sand

  got me rutter gasped back yon-
der thought i-could make it-back to
the ranch-see-my girl-but-

  lets see grunted wares kid prac-
tically

   he explored the blood-caked shirt-front
and lifted a shoulder-point in a little ges-
ture of fatalistic resignation there was
a  hole in rutters chest how he had
ridden this far was the marvel the
ranger squatted there broodingly watch-

ing mechanically along the back-trail in
case the indians appeared

  want me to-sign a paper

  at the painful whisper wares kid
looked down curiously into rutters grim-
lined face

  shore he nodded after a moment
thinking to humor a delirious man if
itll ease yuh

  knowed yuh-had the dead wood on
me-when yuh-found my knife but i
-wasnt goin to-let yuh see carwell
ag in-ever  yuh tried to-make out yuh
never-suspidoned but i knowed idve
got yuh-fore mawnin dam near got
yuh-yesteday mawnin-at the castle
seen yuh-pokin round-pick up some-
thin-skeered me an-i whanged away
hadnt missed-wouldnt be here twas
on the-cards-i reckon

  he stopped wearily breathing in la-
bored wheezes wares kid squatted be-
side him staring down with expressionless
face suddenly rutters wheezes became
louder quicker after a moment the
ranger understood that it was horrible
laughter

  reckon my gal-will do her travelin
-now always after me-to sell out i
done for eph carson-count o that
none o that-money was mine all hisn
i wanted it i-

  his voice trailed off into incoherent
mumbling wares kid bethought him-
self suddenly of what rutter had said
about signing a paper he fumbled in his
jumper pocket and found a letter of the
adjutant general the letter which had sum-
moned him to austin three months ago and
so had brought him indirectly to sit here
tonight a stub of pencil was there too

  a right he snapped sign the pa-
per 

  he supported the murderers head and
shoulders and crooked his knee so that
rutter could lay the paper upon it it was
slow painful work but at last he held the
curt scrawl up in the moonlight and pain-
fully spelled it out

  dell spreen never killed eph carson i
done it and robbed him-simeon rutter

   presently rutter died-without pain ap-
parently wares kid rolled a cigarette
and lit it staring blankly straight ahead

  he shore fooled me he grunted ad-
miringly he shore did an like to
killed me twict at the castle an to-
night he never took me for no injun
he was aimin to down me just fools
wanted

luck im here alive an kickin an with
this-here paper

  he got up thinking to ride for carwell
and tell his story show the confession
suddenly he thought of the girl the wist-
ful-eyed sad-faced girl at the o-bar
ranch-house he squatted again and made
another cigarette

  slowly but surely he mulled the busi-
ness over it came to him finally that
there were really but two persons to be
considered-dell spreen sitting around
the adjutant generals office up at austin
and that girl of rutters absolute vindi-
cation of spreen was easy the means lay
in his hand here but that would mean
a blow at a girl who had had no part in
her fathers cold-blooded deed he pond-
ered the problem at last he nodded

  he would ride back to carwell but the
paper would remain in his jumper pocket
he would tell of rutters death lead a
posse after the apaches he would also
show the townsfolk the spot from which 

eph carson had been shot and explain the
impossibility of dell spreen-a man
shorter even than himself-committing
the murder this might not clear up the
mystery to everyones satisfaction but dell
spreen had no intention of coming back
to this part of the country anyway when
the adjutant general saw the confession it
would clear spreen officially

  then the girl would not be branded-
openly at least-as the daughter of a
brutal callous murderer she would have
no ordeal to face while the o-bar was be-
ing sold she would carry away no bitter
memories to mark her in after-years

  something like this wares kid thought
out he got up again and snapped his
fingers to the black stallion caught the
trailing lariat and again threw a hacka-
more around the blacks nose then vaulted
upon it with carbine across his arm

  reckon shes poor lawr-this way he
reflected but shes shore as hell good

a first-class race horse

by clarence e mulford

at an army post on the plains in the
fearly days the officers of the garrison
hacl some good horses knew it and were
proud of them the best was a thorough-
bred noted locally for its speed one day
a band of indians stopped at the post and
managed with difficulty to get the talk
turned to racing and it was not long before
a race was arranged they had with them
a big buck and his disreputable pony its
forelegs looked to be about three inches
thick its coat was rough long dirty and
filled with burrs the distance was to
be two hundred yards and neither side
had grave doubts regarding the issue
which materially helped along the bet-
ting

  when the word was given the big buck-
let out a yell plied his whip and was yards
down the course before the thoroughbred
knew it was in a race the pony won by
a very scant margin the officers paid
believed they had two horses that could get

away quicker and they proposed another
race there was more betting during the
hour allowed for the pony to rest and the
second race was run with the same result
as the first a third was proposed ac-
cepted by the indians and another hours

rest given the pony

  again the pony got away like a cat but
this time its big rider turned around fac-
ing its rump and made uncomplimentary
signs with his hands while he really let
the pony out winning by a large margin
the band collected its winnings and rode
laughingly away later it was learned
that the big buck and his miserable pony
had been around a six-months circuit of
indian tribes and bands running against
the best animals the other indians could
bring against him and had returned with
over four hundred ponies as his winnings
in that short distance the thoroughbred
was beaten before it could get the tuu
benefit of its longer stride
the son of a sea cook

                      by s b h hurst

 the cook wasnt a cook the son wasnt a son and the rat had two leys ship-
 mates the shipper was tough but before they finished with him the old man

was talking in whispers

he haley on leaving
san francisco had
dropped the pilot and
the decks were being
cleared up a small and
very nervou s man
peeped out of the gal-
ley door he was the
ships cook he looked aft and forward
watching the men at work he looked at
many men carefully sizing them up shak-
ing his head mournfully as his gaze left
one to linger on another but when at last
his eyes rested upon a man who bore the
earmarks of a prizefighter  the heavy-
weight division the cook while still nerv-
ous looked less like a man about to be
hanged he beckoned the big man who
lurched to the galley door the husky
sailor was in a nasty mood and glared at
the scared cook

   finding it difficult to begin the interview
the cook remembered his polite bringing
up this terrible looking man must have
relatives

  hows your father stammered the
cook

  oh you know the old man do you  i
dont suppose he left a bottle with you for
me the big mans eyes roamed about
the galley as if looking for something

  the cook sighed

  i wish i had a son like you he said

sadly id be a proud man

  why didnt you ask father to let you
adopt me then  grinned the big man
whats your name asked the cook
jones

  no i mean your first name said the
cook insistent for all his timidity i like
you and would like to call you by your first
name-like you was my son

  the mystified jones opened his mouth to
make impolite retort then he thought bet-
ter of it a cook can be a good friend to a
hungry sailor

  my name is epictetus he said simply
what the cook leaned feebly against
the galley door did you say epictetus
yes the big man shook his head
mournfully but it aint my fault father
forgot what he wanted to name me so he
left it to the minister and epictetus is
what the minister did 

  too bad said the cook sympatheti-
cally

  whats the matter with epictetus for a
name the big man growled ominously

  oh nothing placated the cook its
the fanciest name i ever heard

  there was a king or something named
epictetus once the big man seemed to
muse upon past glories

  no said the cook respectfully

  dont you dare say there wasnt

  i didnt
the son of a sea cook



  youd better not but what did you
beckon me here for

  the cook became nervously confidential
he leaned close to epictetus jones

  you see im the cook

  of course i can see it epictetus
glared what would you be doing in the
galley if you wasnt

  but i aint a cook the little man shiv-
ered

  youre a cook but you aint a cook
dont you dare talk like that to me

  t mean i aint a cook-i dont know
how to cook

  oh said epictetus sternly then
what are you doing in there-cooking un-
der false pretenses you ought to be ar-
rested  think of the poor hungry sailors
expecting supper but you wont be ar-
rested youll wish you was youll be
hung at the yard arm ill get the rope
ready myself

  the big man turned his head away then
he turned it back again and stared with ju-
dicious solemnity at the unhappy imposter

  maybe youre a murderer in disguise
a poisoner epictetus resumed ill go
aft and tell the old man that i recognize
your picture in the paper-the escaped
poisoner-and you come aboard this decent
ship to practice your dirty poisoning on us
innocent sailors  ill tell the old man
but epictetus lingered his thirsty eyes
roving brightly about the galley

  wait a minute the cook pleaded
thats what i wanted you for-because i
cant cook

  well i cant neither

  i dont want you to- want ycu to be
my son

  epictetus jones spat expressively then
he spoke to himself very gravely

  no the poor feller aint no murderer
-leastwise he was crazy when he done it
he must have escaped from some insane
asylum its my duty to go and tell the
old man immediate

  the cook gripped his arm

  no i aint listen he urged its
money in your pocket and a bottle
epictetus leaned over the galley half-
door the past life of the cook no longer
troubling him

  where is it ne asked almost gently
only if you promise to say youre my
son-tell everybody that im your father
id tell them you was my grandmother
for a bottle of booze epictetus answered
kindly now actually believing that the cook
was not quite right in the head but you
must have married young

  i dont look my age said the cook
proudly

  all right daddy but lets see the
bottle-quick the mate will see me and
holler at me for loafing here

  youll say that i got into a bit of trou-
ble and that you brought me here along of
you so as you could take care of me ill
maybe need protection when the men try
to eat supper said the cook and ill
give you the bottle now and ten dollars
when we get to new york-if you dont
let anybody hit me

  ill see to that grinned epictetus
what did you do to get into trouble
what was you working at before you ran
away

  i sold ladies fancy wear confessed
the sea cook

  you ought to be ashamed of yourself
replied epictetus severely but ill for-
give you-for a bottle but you never met
my old dad in that business

  the cook flushed shaking his head
when i wanted you for a son i-i
imagined about your father he declared
lamely

  hell kill you if he ever finds out
grinned epictetus bit of a liar aint
you are you lying about that bottle

  his expression made the cook produce
the bottle in some haste

  you wont let them hit me he im-
plored as he handed it over

  id like to see them try said epictetus
fiercely

  but i dont want them to try the cook
shivered

  all right dont bother me now i
want to slip into the forecastle and get this
into me answered epictetus hiding this
under his shirt

  and youll say youre my son-then
they wont know i paid you to take care of
me the cook implored

  sure even if they do think im a son
of a sea cook epictetus seemed proud of
his pleasantry but theyd better not call
me anything worse thats bad enough
and epictetus hugging pleasant anticipa-
tions left the galley door

n old-time sailing
ship a fine fair wind
afternoon sunlight mel-
lowing toward sunset
a joyous picture but
the cook did not notice
it he was ahnost a
nervous wreck his view
of things distorted like a scared kid who


frontier stories

had tried to bribe the school bully to pro-
tect him from the other kids he had
never cooked he had never been to sea
before it was nearing supper time the
cook looked at his truly awful efforts in
that direction and groaned

  if i could only get the fire to burn
maybe it would be better i wish id stayed
and faced it instead of running away but
no i darent do that they cant do more
than hit me here and epictetus may stop
them doing that

  the steward came forward to the gal-
ley

  the old man says hes hungry-hurry
supper along will you he said stepping
inside

  then he gave one startled look at the
havoc he surveyed for several seconds the
ex-dealer in ladies fancy wear he passed
a hand over the cold or at least tepid
stove his outraged feelings choked him
while a chill fear of a hungry captains
wrath gripped his vitals

  what-what-what-what the stew-
ard gasped

  i cant cook-i never did cook the
cook screamed like a man under the knife
then he sat down weeping

  the steward who was not a strong man
saw one weaker than himself-one who
could be offered as a sacrifice to an
offended captain he leaped at the cook
yelling bravely

  you would come aboard here would
you spoiling good food ill teach you
you mangy half-size dock rat he shrilled

  a huge shadow blotted out the glow of
the setting sun it was epictetus so
bathed in alcohol that he emitted a radi-
ance or it may have been the sun trying
to shine around him his well-warmed
mind had dreamed of another bottle in the
galley he had come to seek it and his
mood told him that all the world could not
prevent his getting that other bottle he
saw the steward leaping at the cook and
his mood told him that all the rest of the
world also wanted that other bottle

  i might have known it he whispered
then he leaped shouting into battle-and
all the ship hearing that shout came run-
ning to enjoy as they came they heard
noises

  whats all that damned row about for-
rard there shouted the captain who was
standing aft

  a blokes killin the bleedin steward
sir thats all a cockney yelled back
not turning his head lest he miss some-
thing

  this to a hungry captain waiting impa-
tiently for the steward to bring his supper
aft he ran forward and pushed through
the crowd milling around the galley

  why dont you stop it mister he
shouted at the mate

  the mate remained discreetly silent

  a large copper lxiler whizzed past the
captains head he ducked but he was
brave and charged again determined to get
into the galley he saw epictetus-who
apparently had successfully murdered the
steward-engaged in wrecking the place
a vague memory of a dog tearing up the
earth trying to find a rat flashed through
the mind of the captain but it did not in-
form him that the huge epictetus was seek-
ing a bottle still dodging flying utensils
the captain observed a small man huddled
trembling into a comer this the captain
correctly deduced was the cook

  when there was nothing left to throw
out of the door except the stove which
would have stuck epictetus oblivious to
captain officers and crew turned upon the
cook and shook him-but not dangerously
while doing this he placed a thoughtful
foot upon the steward as if to prevent a
possible resurrection

  wheres the bottle he panted

  the unfortunate cook made inarticulate
sounds while the captain backed by both
mates the carpenter and sailmaker rushed
into the galley stepping upon the steward
who gave signs of life with five men at-
tacking him epictetus really began to
fight the cockney and others favored
with ringside places crooned in ecstasy
for all that epictetus had done before had
been as a mere zephyr to a howling hur-
ricane but finally numbers prevailed-in
the sense that epictetus somewhat out of
condition got out of breath leaving his
four assistants to anchor epictetus the
captain his nose bleeding turned savagely
upon the cook

  whats this maniac doing in here who
is he he demanded

  hes my son sir the cook answered
with the utmost affection and not without
pride

he captain stared in-
credulously from the
nervous little man to
epictetus who resem-
bled most curiously the
blood-sweating behe-
moth of holy writ as
depicted by circus post-
ers therefore the cook who was an ex-
the son of a sea cook

cellent salesman hastened to explain

  he takes after his mother sir v

  thats why he wrecked the galley
muttered the steward stirring painfully

  dont try to be clever steward said
the captain severely whats your name
im going to log you for this he de-
manded of the disturber

  the son of a sea cook scowled like a
crocodile

  epictetus he replied unpleasantly

 what

  it wasnt his fault sir the cook
pleaded soothingly it wfas the minister
his full name is epictetus jones

  so the captain condescended to be-
come facetious thai i suppose your
name is davy well davy jones your
offspring with the fancy name will be log-
ged and have his pay stopped until this
mess is paid for and ill put him in irons
till he gets sober

  thats why he wrecked the galley
moaned the steward as if it were the bur-
den of a song

  what do you mean steward  the cap-
tain inquired

  he knows his father cant cook and he
wrecked the galley so as to hide the awful
mess his father had made of the supper
sir

  epictetus grinned filially

  and i cant get you any supper sir
went on the steward not because the
cook aint a cook because im a better
cook than any ships cook but because
there aint no galley sir he seemed to
discuss the matter with himself only a
mechanic would have a chance and he
would have to be a wonderful mechanic

  get up and shut up growled the hun-
grv captain youre mechanic enough to
handle a can-opener arent you he
turned and relieved the carpenter who was
clinging manfully to the right arm of
epictetus go and get the irons chips
well iron this animal to a stanchion if
he breaks away from that ill shoot him
and in spite of the valiant struggles of
epictetus this was done

  with the son helpless the captain turned
upon the father

  what do you mean-signing on as cook
when youre not a cook lie accused

  the cook blushed but did not answer

  why did you run away to sea asked
the captain in the voice of one who de-
mands the truth

  just a bit of trouble about a lady sir
the cook smirked



  the crowd peered neither did any
man believe the cook

  lady snorted the captain well
maybe a lady mistook you for a cockroach
and stepped on you and slipped and hurt
herself captains of sailing ships were
seldom polite and this was a very impolite
captain get into the forecastle youre
disrated-no longer cook but ordinary sea-
man and may the lord have mercy upon
your soul if you have one when the second
mate chases around the deck what the men
leave alive

he shades of night fell
upon the scene with
can-openers and other
implements the stew-
ard managed to feed
the ships company
from the forecastle
came a sound of rev-
elry but this was not caused by the food
but by the ex-cook-who was entertaining

  the second mate came casually to where
the rapidly sobering epictetus embraced an
iron stanchion the second mate lit his
pipe and contemplated the prisoner

  kind of cold and skinny thing for a
man to have his arms around eh he said

  yes sir epictetus grinned when
sober he was that magnificent thing a first
class sailor

  the captain was saying just now that
he thought you might be a good man at
your work went on the second mate

  other captains have said so sir an-
swered epictetus respectfully

  well ill let you go then you can
go forward and get your supper and if
some man has eaten your whack ill not
say a word if you take it out of him but
if you start any trouble with the after-
guard or wreck any more galleys youll be
shot see neither the mate or myself are
elephant men so be reasonable

  ill do my work sir thank you said
epictetus as the welcome key was inserted
into the handcuffs but you know how
it is yourself sir when youve been drunk
for a month and the stuffs dying out of
you and you think someone is hiding a
bottle sir

  i do said the second mate feelingly
now go forrard-well be picking watches
in a little while

  epictetus went forward at the fore-
castle door he paused surveying the per-
formance the men appeared to be visit-
ing the sin of the son upon the father
they had made him wait upon them and
frontier stories

 

do all the forecastle work and now they
were playing the ring a circle of men
formed around the ex-cook were pushing
and buffeting him from one to the other
the ex-cook was weeping and pleading for
mercy-as many other and stronger men
have done in a similar situation a sudden
sympathy for the poor little chap came over
epictetus

  stop it he commanded stepping over
the door combing

  they stopped suddenly awed by his size
and his recent exploits but the cockney
shrilled them into action

  aw hes not so much what if e did
old the old man and the weedin after-
guard theres twenty of us ere

  pass him around boys shouted an-
other giving the ex-cook a push to start
him on his way

  epictetus said nothing but he acted
and the noise of his acting floated aft

  is that fellow at it again  bellowed the
captain grabbing a gun and running for-
ward the mates at his heels

  this time he was not bombarded by boil-
ers or cooking utensils but by sailors
epictetus was throwing them out of the
forecastle that is some of them but as
the captain dodged a flying sailors feet he
saw that no more dodging would be neces-
sary epictetus had disappeared under a
squirming mass he was being suffocated
killed but he made no outcry the ex-
cook in an ecstasy of agony had crawled
for safety into an upper bunk this fight
was serious the captain fired at the fore-
castle roof as he dashed in

  stop it he shouted or ill empty this
gun into you

  the squirming stopped and under the
threat of the gun the mates went into the
forecastle and disentangled epictetus he
breathed heavily for a moment and then
addressed the captain with much respect

  thank you sir if you and the mates
hadnt come along these fellers might have
made my nose bleed or something and
blooded my shore-going shirt now sir
to show you i appreciate what you did 
fight all hands-two at a time-and you
can look on and enjoy yourself

  the captain grinned but regretfully de-
clined this magnificent offer

  im not saying that you started this
more for love of fight than for love of
your father he said but i will say
that this crew is signed on to work not to
be experimented upon for the benefit of
doctors and hospitals now i want no
more of it get aft the lot of you and

the mates will pick watches and remem-
ber if theres any more trouble ill keep
all hands up in their watches below until
they get tame

atches were picked
and the routine of ship- j
board set in but the 
last state of the ex-cook
was worse than the j
first for now the sec- 
ond mate-who having i
the last pick had been 
compelled to take him in his watch-rode 
him for a no-sailor smothered him in 
dirty work and harried him for fun the
hard life of the sailing ships made hard
men epictetus who was in the mates
watch could do little to protect his father i
for epictetus was on deck when the watch
below experimented in persecution-he
could neither leave the wheel or his job to i
see to his fathers comfort in the fore- j
castle

  finally the cook could stand it no longer i
one quiet night he left his bunk and went 
to where epictetus reclined against a coil
of rope with a more or less meditative pipe

  epictetus he began brokenly i cant
stand any more of this id rather be dead j
and in hell im going to jump overboard i
and drown myself

  epictetus who was physically incapable 
of understanding such a state of nerves j
and inability to protect oneself spoke 
gruffly

  dont be a damned fool

  you dont know what it means 
moaned the cook ill jump over the side j
-unless i can find a place to hide where
can i hide on a ship so that nobody can
find me

  epictetus grinned as would any sailor
at this extraordinary question

  no place a man can hide but he
added reminiscently i had a monkey once
in a ship where the old man hated mon-
keys so i hid it in the fore peak but
they found it in the end

  the ex-cook was a nervous man but he
had more nimble wits than epictetus a
wonderful idea came to him

  im going to jump overboard and hide
afterward he announced

  epictetus leaned forward and shook him
gently

  youre crazy he said briefly

  im not said the cook animatedly
listen ill scream in the middle of the
night then ill throw something over-
board that will make a splash youll be
the son of a sea cook



at the wheel and you can shout man over-
board and while all hands is yelling and
backing the yards ill hide down the fore
peak after that you can pass food down
to me-i aint a big eater-or i can creep
out at night and steal it when we get to
new york i can slip on shore

  crazy epictetus said laughing it
cant be done even if i was fool enough to
help you you might make them think
you was over the side and drowned but
you couldnt live down in the fore peak
because the hatch is kept on and youd
smother and you cant steal food-unless
you can get into the stewards pantry or
the lazarette and thats too hard for an
ordinary thief you cant steal any of the
mens allowance you know epictetus
concluded sternly alluding to the greatest
of shipboard sins

  i wont im a better thief than you
think i am said the ex-cook and you
can take the hatch off the fore peak enough
to give me air

  epictetus shook his head

  if a bit of wind comes that cant be
done he said the water coming over
the bows would fill the fore peak and then
there would be hell

  maybe in bad weather i could find
some other place suggested the ex-cook
hopefully

  the captains cabin i suppose grin-
ned epictetus nice and warm in there
too

  well im going to do it anyhow ex-
claimed the ex-cook with unusual deter-
mination whether you help me or not
the hell said epictetus with some ad-
miration oh say what did you do ashore
that you had to run tell me right now
no fooling

  youll never tell anybody

  ill kiss the book i wont

  so the ex-cook told epictetus laughed
but he never revealed the secret

  and im going overboard in an hour
said the ex-cook

  go and turn in advised epictetus
its your watch below its my wheel in
half an hour

  thats why im going overboard to
drown when i am-when youre at the
wheel said the ex-cook emphatically

  the sailors sometimes inhuman delight
in skylarking was exceedingly well devel-
oped in epictetus he forgot the acces-
ories he forgot the fore peak hatch he
forgot the food he forgot everything ex-
cept a delightful vision of the watch be-
low being roused on deck-a watch for

whom he had no affection-and of all
hands working frantically to save an
imagined drowning man while all he would
have to do would be to twist the spokes of
the wheel occasionally he answered the
ex-cook with the utmost kindness

   go ahead and drown yourself he said

t was the middle
watch and a fine night
with the halcyon mak-
ing about five knots an
hour  a wind epic-
tetus took the wheel at
two oclock as happy
as a boy going to a cir-
cus the lookout was relieved the mate
walked the weather side of the poop and
the ship grew quiet as the watch on deck
found soft planks it was very dark sud-
denly the quiet was broken by a ghastly
howl

  good-by cruel world good-by
followed by a tremendous splash

  it was done so naturally-not to say
dramatically-that even epictetus joined
in the cry man overboard

   so naturally was it done that epictetus
obeying the order to keep her up in the
wind wondered if his father had not after
all committed suicide

  i think it was the handle of the deck
pump he muttered but i can find out
at eight bells

  meanwhile the ship was seething with
well-directed activity

  see anything of the man the captain
who had rushed on deck demanded of a
hand sent to the mizzen top

   not a sign sir shouted the sailor i
think i saw the life buoy the mate threw
over a minute ago but nothing of a man
near it

  it was the pump handle thought epic-
tetus relieved

  they brought the ship back and close
alongside the floating buoy but not a
sign of the man overboard and by this
time it had been established that the ex-
cook was the victim the captain called
the hands together

  you may put a boat over if you wish
men he said gravely but were right
alongside the life buoy and theres no sign
of the poor fellow anybody see him fall 

  no man had seen the ex-cook go over-
board an old sailor named evans spoke
up in answer to the captain

   we can all see the buoy alongside sir
and no man anywhere near it he must
have sunk like a piece of iron-


frontier stories

   he did thought epictetus jones

  -and it aint no use getting the boat
over sir the man in the mizzen top can
see farther than we could in the boat and
he sees nothing i guess the poor little
fellers gone sir

   im afraid so said the captain sadly
poor little chap he wasnt used to ships
and likely got up on the rail for something
and slipped

  but he shouted good-by or something
sir said the mate

   lets forget that part of it said the
old man its kinder

  the hush and solemnity of death settled
upon the halcyon the men who had bul-
lied the ex-cook overwhelmed with honest
remorse they filled the yards again and
changed watches epictetus was relieved
and went forward to investigate it was
the pump handle the other men spoke
softly and regarded him with extreme sym-
pathy epictetus was enjoying himself

  he scared me though mused the big
man he saw the fore peak hatch was off
and knew where his father lay hidden
hes all right for tonight anyway

  but he went to his bunk with a dawning
realization of the trouble likely to be in
store he had some difficulty stifling his
chuckles as he lay in his bunk smoking a
final pipe

  the trouble began next morning the
fore peak was the storehouse below decks
for rope paint and boatswains gear need-
ing new rope for a main royal brace the
second mate went forward he found the
fore peak hatch off and swore but as he
might have left it that way himself he
made no outcry he went down the lad-
der into the dark recesses of the place
armed with a lantern presently he came
up again with the rope he carefully re-
placed the hatch and went aft to the stew-
ard

  let me have the rat trap steward he
said i heard a rat down in the fore
peak put a hunk of cheese in it

  the steward produced the trap duly
baited rats are never poisoned on board
ship as they would only die below and
become unpleasant instead a large wire
cage trap is used and the captured rats
furnish amusement for the sailors the
second mate carried the trap forward and
deposited it down in the fore peak where
he thought it would do most good but he
had no idea of the good it would do the
drowned man was very hungry he had
had no opportunity to steal anything an
hour later the second mate investigated the

trap he found the cheese gone but no
rat

  thats a clever rat he mused and he
went on deck again intending to get more
cheese and secure it with twine so the rat
could not take it without getting caught
as he merged from below lie ran into
epictetus who hastily concealed a ships
biscuit which had he arrived five seconds
earlier he would have thrown down the
fore peak probably hitting the second
mate

  theres a hell of a rat down there
jones said the second mate

  a-a what sir  asked epictetus star-
tled

  a rat a darned clever old bird too
took the cheese out of the trap and never
got caught but he wont do it again
what are you going to bait it with now
sir asked epictetus a trifle anxiously

  what do you think asked the second
mate

  bread might be good it goes well
with cheese sir answered epictetus ab-
sently

  bread say jones you must think
thats a pet rat i have down there

  i thought the bread might tempt him
sir stammered epictetus

  tempt that rat doesnt need tempt-
ing hes an old tough bird i tell you
and dangerous if we dont get him and
he gets real hungry hes liable to come out
at nights and eat anything he can get ive
seen sleeping sailors bitten by rats and
they got bad blood poisoning-so have
you

  yes sir i have answered epictetus
truly but this may not be that sort of
a rat sir-not a man-eating rat i mean
oh see said the second mate sarcas-
tically i suppose you would suggest i
bait the trap with pea soup eh

  he might-it might entice him into the
trap sir epictetus was a bit rattled
you can never tell sir

  and a spoon for him to eat it with
eh

  no no sir he wouldnt need a spoon
said epictetus

  no he wont-because he wont get
soup laughed the second mate cheese
is the best rat food and ill fix the next
piece so no rat on earth can get it without
springing the trap

  he did this to the best of his ability he
looked at the trap in an hour or so the
cheese was still there as the drowned man
had had enough cheese but in the first
dog watch when the second mate again in 
the son of a sea cook

 

vestigated the cheese was missing he
went aft and annoyed the captain by asking
that gentleman if he had a book in his
cabin which told about the habits of rats

hat night a cake the
steward had prepared
for the captains special
use was taken from the
pantry leaving no clue
the steward did say
though that lying half
asleep he had heard
heavy breathing the second mate of
course blamed the rat and carefully bat-
tened down the fore peak hatch so the rat
would be kept prisoner until he could dis-
cover a way of catching it

  the next night the second mate roused
the poor steward roughly out of bed the
officers midnight supper always laid out
at the end of the cabin table was missing
why didnt the steward remember his
duty in vain the steward protested that
he had laid out a specially nice supper the
second mate would not believe him and he
would not believe the rat had done it be-
cause there were no crumbs scattered
around

  but he stormed some fellow is do-
ing this for spite i battened down the
fore peak hatch and now its off again
theres a man aboard this ship that likes
rats better than he does me but ill get
him

  the next night the steward carefully
locked up all food asking the second mate
to wake him at midnight when he would
arise and get the supper it was one of
those peculiar nights known only to the sea
-a meteorological freak a ghastly night
a night that got under the skins of sailors
and fed their superstitions

  there was no wind it was very dark
muggily warm the atmosphere full of elec-
tricity making men uneasy uncomforta-
ble pale and seemingly slow flashes of
lightning came suddenly out of the dark
from nowhere making the ship loom like
the spectral ornament of a deserted ceme-
tery corpse lights-balls of electric fire
of the size and shape of skulls-floated
along the yards men shivered and prayed
for wind they spoke in whispers ex-
pecting sudden and perhaps dangerous
wind from any quarter the sails had
mostly been clewed up which caused a
weird skeleton effect when the lightning
came

  the drowned man crept from his lair-
epictetus having removed the fore peak

hatch at some risk to himself along the
dark bulwarks the hungry one made his
way stealthily he reached the cabin al-
leyway and slipped in but nowhere could
he find food he could smell food but this
only made things worse finally his bare
toes stubbed against the medicine chest
lashed to the mizzenmast near the cabin
table not knowing the ways of ships the
drowned man hoped for a food locker and
raised the lid of the chest

  he found only bottles and bandages he
fingered the bottles and smelled castor oil
he groaned silently then his eager fin-
gers clutched on another bottle it was
the sacred medicine chest bottle of brandy
kept for accidents to touch which is sac-
rilege but the cook did not know that
he did know that he was hungry and weak
and he knew brandy when he smelled it
he took a large drink he found it grate-
ful and comforting he took another
drink and felt as strong and brave as
epictetus himself but he did not want
to be caught and left the cabin quietly

  going forward to enjoy himself in the
fore peak he saw the watch coming aft
pie could not get past them with no-
where else to turn he slipped up the main
rigging-the darkness hiding him nor-
mally wild horses could not have coaxed
him up the rigging but the brandy was
more powerful

n the main top-a
small platform about
forty feet above the
deck which spreads the
topmast rigging-t h e
ex-cook rested panting
heavily he relieved
himself with another
drink and felt very sociable he wanted
to talk to someone to share his good feel-
ings with friends there was still some
brandy left in the bottle and who better
than epictetus who was no teetotaler the
brandy had stolen the drowned mans cau-
tion he opened his mouth to call epic-
tetus he told himself that he must not
call too loud or the other men would hear
him he opened his mouth but a fearful
peal of thunder drowned what came out of
it

  startled the ex-cook dropped the bottle
it fell with an awful noise in the quiet
following the thunder men shivered and
clutched at one another as the glass scat-
tered with a sound like mens bones break-
ing and then to raise the horror of the
night beyond human ability to endure a
frontier stories

 rhin voice swept the silent ship

   epictetus epictetus

  there was no answer the crew was
 stricken dumb with fear

  and then-meaning but to identify
 himself to his son-the drowned man try-
 ing to whisper moaned corroboration of
 the sailors dread

  epictetus epictetus i am your
 fathers ghost

   he was answered by shrieks of dismay
 from certain of the sailors who actually
 groveled on the deck

   answer it answer it jones trem-
 bled the usually tough second mate who
 recollecting that he was an officer and a
 gentleman strove to keep his head

   epictetus could not obey for two rea-
 sons the first was that he had never
 spoken to a ghost and he did not know
 how the second that he darent open his
 mouth because he knew he would laugh
 his laughter would have been mistaken for
 hysteria-so far was the crew from laugh-
 ter-but epictetus did not know this

   speak to it repeated the second mate
 manfully

   the captain saved the situation

   no ghosts going to run my ship he
 declared loudly but without assurance

   epictetus epictetus where are you
 wailed the ghost

   ill shoot the beast exclaimed the cap-
 tain taking a wavering aim in the general
 direction of the main top

   no no sir you mustnt epictetus
 grasped the captain by his pistol arm

   why not demanded the captain stif-
 fened by the touch of real flesh and bone

  its unlucky sir stammered epic-
tetus yes sir thats what it is no
good ever came of shooting a ghost sir

   thats right came the unhappy chorus j
of the crew

  a great flash of lightning lighted the
spectral scene it showed to the horrified
sailors a replica of the dead ex-cook cling-
ing precariously to the main backstay- f
clinging apparently to nothing after the
manner of ghosts but it showed epic-
tetus something else he saw that his
father was falling and leaped to a feat 
that while it lias been done has been done 
seldom the cook fell through a deluge of i
thunder and epictetus caught him just j
before he would have broken himself on 
the deck

  all the world went dark for epictetus 
jones he became aware of things of ly- 
ing on the main hatch gently tended

  get that bottle of brandy out of the 
medicine chest steward and hurry v he 
heard the captain order and decided that 
atching ghosts was a worth while occupa- 
tion-not knowing what had happened to 
the cherished brandy

  ive only heard of that being done once i
before exclaimed the captain ill for- i
give this man for hiding his father on us j
the tone of the captains voice became i
both admiring and affectionate id for-
give him anything-the darned old son-of- i
a-gun

  and then epictetus heard the voice of
his father as one who speaks through an
alcoholic fog yet desires to be understood 

  no not shon-of-a-gunish-no no hes j
darned old son of a sea cook

no quarter

by william crump rush

   in days of old when knights were bold-they did not have to crouch unpro-
   tected behind a meager patch of prickly pear and face a storm of well aimed

lead

ee carter was six
foot one in his socks
and weighed a hun-
dred and eighty pounds
with an acre or two of
shirt showing between
his short vest and his
belt and his sleeves
half way to his elbows he looked
as if he had just jumped out of a
comic strip in a dress suit he would have
been a panic in a roomful of particular
women for he was handsome and didnt
know it there was not a chance that zee
ever would put on a dress suit he was
just a top hand on the y bar ranch down
in the cactus country still women have
a way of knowing how a man would look
in a dress suit whether he ever wears one
or not-but that was another matter

  this young giant was the most timid
man in the world in the presence of wo-
men and the best natured fellow alive
around menfolks just one time in all his
twenty-six years had he reared up and said
no good and loud that was when
he got old enough to realize what his
parents had done to him in the matter of a
name he wasnt a greek philosopher or
any other kind of a philosopher they
had named the poor boy zeno and to make
the crime stick had given him  other
name he changed it to zee and for fear

someone would ask what the z stood for
he always wrote it z-e-e zee as soon as
he could decently leave home he drifted to
texas and became a cow-prodder in the
hope of living down his name

  like any other honest puncher in that
wild and unpeopled country zee had a side
partner his name was gid stewart gid
wasnt six foot and as one of the ranch
hands said he would have looked like old
man satan m hell no matter what he
wore the more clothes he put on the
worse he looked his hair was subdued
carrot in color his face was blotched with
freckles and painful to look at except for
his happy blue eyes his legs looked as if
they had been tied around a barrel and left
to dry that way gids outstanding char-
acteristic was near-worship for zee carter
and a determination to keep anyone from
finding it out the result was that the
partners quarreled incessantly to the
amusement of the rest of the outfit

  it was august and there had been no
rain since the spring roundup the whole
world was crackling singeing hot hav-
ing eaten the noon meal the hands were
loafing in the bunkhouse waiting for it to
get a little cooler before they rode out to
the range

  i reckn them old chaps histry tells
about were the bravest men that ever lived
on earth opined zee as he dropped a
frontier stories

 jo

dog-eared book and rolled a smoke it
was a book that he never tired of reading
-when he wasnt looking at pictures of
knignts in armor moats draw-bridges and
the like

  huh looks to me like them fellows
liad a cinch growled gid contrary as
usual they didnt pack nothin but a
sharp stick and a butcher kuife a feller
had to ketch one of them before he could
kill him all a rider needed to be brave in
them times was a little better braunk or a
better pair of laigs than the other fellow
had then he could lope up and look the
other gent over if he wasnt too rough
he could kill him take his braunk and
chawin tobacco and look for another one
if the gent looked like sam bass-or
some other real bad hombre-he could
just let his braunk get skeered or over-
work his laigs a little while and hed be
safe it was a whole lot different from
here in this chaparral where the other fel-
low can squat behind a pear thicket and
pump you so full of lead you wobble be-
fore you ever even see him why-

  hey wait a minute yelled zee
you aint got no appointment to just
plumb preach here today have you let
me talk some when them old-timers fit
they fit to a final deecision when the
fight was over they wasnt but one of em
left he taken both braunks and saddles
and went on about his business thout
no modem weepons they just taken their
fighting dry so yelled no quarter
and hopped to it

  yeah no quarter who wants a
quarter id as soon be plumb bust and
be done with it as to have only but two
bits you listen to sense a minute when
one of them knight boys is riding the range
and jumps three of a kind or two pair or
something what does he do why he
throws the leather to his braunk lopes
acrost a bridge pulls the string and there
he is safe in his hole and the hole pulled
in after him old scratch couldnt get him
in a week with a new crowbar what hap-
pens to a pore lone y bar puncher if he
gets acrost the range line and rides outer
four-five dimunt l cutthroats hazin a
bunch of y bar stuff to market what
happens then

huh tends on who the pore lone

puncher happens to be now me-

  yeah a brave man like you that takes
book lessons from the knight boys might
do right smart but me now-suppose i
bucks a deal like that if i see em in time
to turn and run do i make it to ary cas-

tle not me i make it to the ranch
bandons my braunk and crawls under the 
bunk shacks up comes them dimunt l
rustlers shoots my braunk sets the shack i
afire and where am i pretty hot aint 
it 

  a roar of laughter followed this the 
thought of gid stewart or zee carter i
eidier running from anything on earth was 
hilariously funny they alf knew that if 
gid met the devil carrying a pot of blazing 
pitch hed roll a smoke and say gimme a 
light podner

he y bar was in the
cactus country on the
lower rio grande not i
pincushion cactus in i
a bow for show pur-
poses but every kind of j
cactus known to the
world and some uncat-j
aloged varieties prickly pear higher than
the head of a mounted man spanish dag-
gers that would have made fair lances for i
the knight boys and every thorny bush i
known to botany

  old gabe young had located the y bar i
in that country because he didnt want to 
be crowded and because he knew the value i
of tallow weed range he never had
been crowded until now and the ranch that i
was crowding him was thirty miles away 
gabe young had known from the first 
that there was something wrong with the 
diamond l outfit but he worked cattle 
with them the first year also the hand- j
some foreman of the diamond l dave
wait was often a visitor at the y bar 
ranch-house

  about the time he discovered that the
diamond l outfit was a gang of rustlers i
and severed friendly relations with them j
old man gabe discovered something else 
he could and did break off relations with 
the diamond l by the simple statement to
waite that he knew they were a gang of 
damned rustlers and hed shoot the next
diamond l man he found on his range
that was easy all he had to do was to 
tell his men to back up his edict but sever-
ing relations between the handsome dave 
waite and gabes equally handsome
daughter and only child jenny young 
was another matter

  with due regard for his handsome per j
son dave waite stayed away from the y j
bar but twice a week rain shine storm 
or tempest jenny rode to palo alto it i
was fifteen miles south of the y bar
ranch-house and twenty from the dia-
no quarter

 mond l there was nothing there but a
 little store and postoffice it stood on a
 round knob that was covered with live-
 oak timber hence the name american
 punchers called it timber hill old man
 gabe knew jenny got letters from dave
 waite and he was morally certain that she
 sometimes met waite at the little store

   ah he could do was curse and tell him-
 self hed have to kill dave waite jenny
 was a girl that couldnt be talked to mrs
 young who worshipped her and relied
 on her for company there on the lonely
 ranch could never deny her anything
 rough old gabe just gave her all the
 money she wanted and kept out of it

   whats the matter with jenny he
 speculated has she gone clean crazy
 why dont she marry some decent puncher
 and have it over with 

   oh gabe replied his wife youre
 so rough jenny is just like any other
 young girl she wants men company
 might be some of our boys shed like but
 they wouldnt never offer to keep her com-
 pany if you make such a fuss about the
 foreman of a big ranch paying attention to
 her theyd expect you to shoot a common
 hand if he even looked at her

   oh they would 

  yes they would everybody thinks
 you picked that quarrel with the diamond
 l just to stop dave from coming here and

   oh they do well now you listen to
 me letty i aint got nothin agin any
 honest man that jenny wants but i dont
 aim for my daughter to tie up with a thief
 i want you to talk to jenny shes gone to

 palo alto today hot as it is and-

   you talk to her gabe youre the one

that wants-

   in order to keep from swearing in the
 presence of his wife which was the one
 concession that old man gabe made to the
 conventions he stepped out the door
 passed through the grove of big mesquites
 in the yard through the gate in the palis-
 ade fence and trundled his spurs along the
 sun-cooked trail that led to the bunkhouse
 he was so mad the smoke was coming out
 of his ears and eyes and he hoped to find
 a diversion

   in the bunk shack the boys were laugh-

 ing at the quarrel between zee and gid

i but another diversion was coming it came
 tearing through the pear thickets looking
back from time to time as if a whole bat-
 talion of demons were after it this di-

t version was nothing more than old simone
a mexican vaquero his horse slid to a



stop and he fairly fell into the bunkhouse
door

  hey whats the matter with you si-
mone yelled gid stewart bustin in
thout knockin thataway might been
ladies present

  as a matter of fact simone hadnt in-
tended to enter the house social lines on
the y bar were very closely drawn the
mexican hands lived with their families in
a little village of jacales a quarter of a mile
from the ranch-house

  mucho ftiego senores sputtered the
mexican when he caught his breath

  whats that roared old man gabe
who came up just as simones fuse quit
sputtering and he went off

  no quiera dios el rancho se quema
senor

  the ranch is burning what do you
mean  spit it out before you choke

t that a flood of
spanish escaped si-
mone to the effect that
ten or twelve miles to
the southwest the y
bar range was burning
he had seen men set-
ting it he had gone to
them they had shot at him blood drip-
ping from the fingers of his right hand and
a bullet hole in the sleeve of his shirt cor-
roborated his story asked who was set-
ting the fire he said he saw only two of
them and they were diamond l punchers

  before simone had finished his story
old man gabs had whipped out bis knife
and cut away the mexicans shirt sleeve
exposing a bleeding flesh wound just above
the elbow

  go to the house simone and let mrs
young doctor that arm said old man
gabe his voice suddenly gone soft and low
and humming like a tight wire

  that was his way he blustered and
roared about a pair of lost hobbles but be-
came a silent seething volcano before a
real eruption

  by the time simone had finished his
story the men had come tumbling out of
the bunkhouse inside of five minutes
with old man gabe at their head they
were tearing through the pear thickets
toward the fire in all civilized countries
arson has long been considered a crime in
the class with murder firing a mans
range at a time like that was arson of the
worst sort dry as it was with that strong
hot wind blowing from the southwest the
fire would soon sweep the best part of
frontier stories

 

youngs range and leave his cattle to die

  fighting fire in open prairie or even in
timber is possible of success fighting
lire in pear thickets just cant be done ac-
cording to simones story the fire had
been started in open country about a mile
from the chaparral if they could reach it
before it struck the cactus there was hope
if not there was none so on they rode at
top speed in spite of the heat half-way
to the fire the speed and the heat were be-
ginning to tell on their mounts already
some were dropping behind in the lead
were old man gabe zee and gid

  before they reached the fire they realized
it was too late suddenly the red smoke of
the prairie fire changed to the thick steamy
pall of the chaparral from such glimpses
as they could get through the smoke they
knew tliat the fire had been set well to the
west and carried in a line due south

  aim to burn me clean out i reckn
said old man gabe in soft vibrant tones
as he stopped and waited for the others to
come up all right well go talk to
em about it

  the others came up and stopped their
horses heaving from running in the chok-
ing heat and smoke-filled air

  boy said gabe sweetly i reckn we
got to clean up that diamond l outfit
well just turn south go to the end of the
fire and see what we can find the mex-
icans will keep it away from the house and
the pens dont crowd your horses too
much or some of youll be afoot

  keeping back from the smoke cloud
they rode steadily south for two miles un-
til they came to the worn trail that led to
palo alto just as they reached the trail
a stocking-footed roan came storming
along the stirrups of the empty saddle
flapping the bushes by the trail and the
ponys scorched mane waving in the wind

  good god cried young theres
jennys mount coming from palo alto
he had barely finished speaking when
zee whirled into the trail with gid at his
heels and stormed straight into the fire
which was burning across the trail

  come back you damned fools
shouted old gabe youll be burned to
death but iris voice merely bounded back
from the wall of smoke and heat zee
and gid were gone right into the heart of
the inferno and the frightened roan had
turned and followed them

  oh hell said old gabe as if he were
about to cry four of you fellows go
back to the ranch and direct the mexicans
fire against this and try to save a little

j-atch of grass for the saddle stock the
rest of us will go on

hen zee and gid broke
through the wall of
smoke and flame they
came out gasping for
breath their eyes filled
with tears and their
clothing on fire in a
dozen places a mile
farther across the black desolate burned
over ground they came to where the fire
was burning slowly back against the wind
just beyond the fire stood jenny young
waving desperately at them they passed
through the slight fire and gulped a few
breaths of fresh air

  why why-howd yo braunk get
away miss jenny zee asked bashfully- j
aipt hurt are you

  no im not hurt but-

  better mount and go back to the store
were in a hurry and you cant get home
through this

  i-i dont want to go back to the store

i want to go with you

  but its going to be rough where were
goin 

  i dont care im going with you
  wellm i reckn youre the boss

  as they thundered along the open prai-
rie following the backfire steadily south
the way the firebugs had gone zee was
wondering how tlie blazes did that roan
get away from jenny she could ride
anything on the ranch she wasnt hurt
there was no indication that she had been
thrown why wouldnt she go back to the
store instead of following them into the
middle of hell they rounded a grove of
mesquite trees and pear and saw ten men
coming from the head of the fire and still
half a mile away

  that cant be old man gabe and
them zee muttered as they pulled up

  hell no replied the keen-eyed gid
thats dimunt l riders wonder where
theyre goin

  cornin for us replied zee grimly

  it was too late to turn and run for the
little grove they had just passed any-
way they couldnt have gotten into it for
it was grown up with pear and chaparral
between them and the oncoming horsemen
was a deep arroyo the race was now for
it and the three had the advantage they
rode down into the ravine while the dia-
mond l men were yet two hundred yards
away but already firing at them in the
bottom of the ravine they sprang from
no quarter

their horses zee helper jenny from her
stocking-footed roan

  sit down on the ground right against
the bank miss jenny and stay there no
matter what happens he rapped out

  there was no time for formalities the
partners had jerked their carbines from
their saddles as they dismounted and now
they turned to the bitter business in hand
they didnt know just why the diamond l
boys had opened on them but they had
and there was  time to ask questions
they were less than a hundred yards from
the ravine when zees rifle spat viciously
and the foremost one of the gang pitched
from his horse while the others slid to a
stop and gave back a bit

  fire on a woman would you grated
zee as he threw another cartridge into the
barrel get meat when you shoot gid
they wont give us time to reload

  as a matter of fact the diamond l men
had been unable to tell that there was a
woman with the partners but it would
have made little difference the fight was
on shoulder to shoulder under the bank
with nothing but a little cluster of pear at
the top to shield them when they crept up
to shoot zee and gid faced the odds of
five to one gid got one and the odds
were reduced to four to one but the dia-
mond l men had  notion of quitting the
fight they merely drew back a little and
substituted rifles for six-shooters they
were trying to cover their tracks they
thought they had gotten old simone and
now they were going to kill these three so
that no charge of firing the y bar range
could be sustained against them there
was little law in the cactus country but
there was enough and of a very sudden
and dangerous kind to make short work
of range burners it the charge was proved
on them as zee raised up to fire a per-
fect hail of bullets swept across the ravine
gid heard a soft thud and and saw a bul-
let hole in the lower part of zees right
shoulder zee didnt even flinch but kept
his gun working until another horseman
slid from his saddle

  some of that no two-bits stuff
growled gid as cartridges clicked through
the loading gate of his carbine look
out theyll get you if you stand up that
way

  too late zee was standing up with
half of his body exposed and two more of
the attackers went down under his level
shooting then a bullet cut across the top
of his right hip his leg went numb and
tailing he rolled to the bottom o the



resaca with a yell the remaining six
swept forward to the final charge

  come on and go with me chortled
gid stewart as he laid his gun to the
cheek and at short range toppled two from
their horses but the end was near the
four were sending a storm of lead over and
through the little gulch of pear and tear-
ing loose the dirt on the other side of the
ravine suddenly the attackers were swept
by a flank attack old gabe young and
his men had torn through the fire when
they heard the first shots another min-
ute and those ten would never fire an-
other range old man gabe rode up and
peered down into the deep ravine

  thank god he cried theres

jenny but-

  oh daddy daddy do something

quick hes-hes-

  the last thing zee knew his head was
resting on a funny sort of pillow it was
jenny youngs lap it seemed to him that
it had been but about five minutes when
he woke again but things were not right
he was in a bed and he had whiskers all
over his face he tried to raise his hand
and it wouldnt come up he looked around
and decided that he wasnt in the bunk-
house where the devil was everybody
he wanted to know some things was the
range all burned did they lose any cat-
tle and-oh a lot of things he tried to
call and found that his voice w-asnt work-
ing so he shut his eyes and went to sleep
again

  zee had no knowledge of old man gabe
and the boys bringing him to the y bar
across the black smoking choking burned
range thinking they would bury him when
they got him there he didnt know that
gid had killed a good horse getting a doc-
tor to the ranch and had almost killed the
doctor for not hurrying beyond human en-
durance there was also anotiier little mat-
ter-in fact the thing that had caused all
the trouble that zee didnt know a thing
about

ne evening after the
doctor had said that
zee would live old
gabe young and liis
daughter were sitting
on the gallery at the old
dobe ranch-house wrhile
gid took a turn at the
bedside old man gabe was smoking and
there was a deep wrinkle between his eyes
finally he turned to jenny


frontier stories

  how come you to be afoot that day of
the fire jenny he asked

  daddy ive been wanting to tell you
about it but ive been afraid to

   afraid  what are you afraid of 
   you

  huh first time i ever heard you be-
ing afraid of me must be something
wrong about that

   yes there was a whole lot wrong about
it but i didnt think so at the time  was
the cause of all the trouble

  how come

   i kept writing to dave waite and meet-
ing him at palo alto when i knew you
didnt want me to meet him then that
day he-he wanted me to run away and

marry him and--

  why didnt you do it

  daddy you didnt want me to did
you

  oh no id have hunted him up and
shot him if you had i was just wonder-
ing why you didnt

  why it was because i never did care
anything about dave waite i didnt be-
lieve he was crooked then but i just
didnt care for him like a woman cares for
a man she marries i was just trying to-
trying to-you understand

   sure i understand perfectly i dont
reckon but the point is what was you
doing afoot that day

  well when dave waite got insistent
and ugly he accused me of encouraging
him and i got mad and said some things
to him after that i went into the store
while i was in there dave and his men
turned stockings loose and threw a scare
into him that they thought would last him
until he got to the y bar the last thing
dave said to me was your pap thinks my
outfits bad all light well give him
something to make him keep on thinking
it i didnt have any idea what he meant
then i couldnt get a horse at palo alto
so i started on to the ranch on foot think-
ing id find stockings grazing along the
trail somewhere when i saw the fire i
knew they were burning you out and i-
i cried i could see then where i had
done wrong and-and- jenny choked
up and hung her head in shame

   thats all right jenny soothed old
gabe it had to come sometime and we
got out of it pretty cheap in fact im a
whole lot ahead of the game account of
something i learned

  cheap cheap oh daddy how can
you say that when-when- and with a
sob jenny rose and went into the house

  now what the hell have i done mut-
tered old gabe to himself she said she
didnt care anything about dave waite i
dont make any difference if she does now
for the diamond l outfit wont never
bother anybody again a woman is a
damneder curiosity than one of these here
newfangled phonygrafts

iien zee carter woke
again things looked bet-
ter and he felt better
mrs young fed him
some broth and he
went to sleep again
came a day when he
could eat a man-size
meal of beef and biscuits then he rolled
a smoke as he sat up in bed and old man
gabe came in to talk to him

  well you decided to stay on this side
of the divide a while longer did you
greeted young

  looks like it mighty glad you came
in lot of things ive been wanting to
know did the range all burn what did
you do with the cattle

  well son the range in this cactus
country is curiouser than a woman or an
alarm clock and they are two of the most
onnatural and ondependable fool tilings in
the world the night after the fire we
had the dangedest rain that has fell in this
country in the twenty year that i been
ranching here and what do you suppose
happens 

  ground was so hot that the grass was
knee high by next morning grinned zee

  worsen that i learned something that
id orter knowed all them twenty years
the fire burned the stickers all offn the
pear and the rain washed em clean i
just knowed we had to move to grass for
all the range we had left was about a sec-
tion here around the ranch-house that the
mexicans saved in a day or two we
started out to gather and drive and dang
my hide if the cattle wasnt eating them
singed pear they kept on eating them
and now theyre seal fat first time i ever
knowed wrhat godamighty made the stuff
for the grass came all right and lots of
tallow weed winter range is going to be
better than for years im feeling fine
dimond l gone this discovery made you
getting well and everything to the good
they talked on a while and then old
man gabe went on about his business it
was late afternoon when the old man re-
turned to the ratich-house he hung his
belt and gun on the bed post as usual then
no quarter

crept softly to the door of zees room if
the boy was still asleep he didnt want to
wake him the door stood partly open
and old gabe heard voices coming from the
room he peered in and saw jenny sit-
ting by the bedside she was leaning over
with her head on zees breast and he was
stroking her hair with one of his white
hands

  but honey i knew all the time you
loved me and you ought to have known
that i loved you she told him softly
how could i help it

  i dunno but what about dave waite
asked zee doubtingly didnt you love
me none until after he was dead

  oh you silly boy i never did care
anything about dave waite or anybody
else but you i just noticed dave to-to
make you jealous and it made me furious
because you wouldnt be jealous

  old man gabe crept silently away from
the door with a broad grin on his wrinkled
leathery face

  well ill be just about half-way
damned he muttered when he was back
in his room with the door shut a woman
is one hell of an institution jennys got
right good sense after all

  half an hour later when gid crept to
the door to see if his partner was still
asleep conditions hadnt changed percep-
tibly in the sick room gid peeped in

growled under his breath pore feller

boys and this is some more of that no
quarter stuff reckn it aint so bad at
that zee seems to like it

the range calf

by clarence e mulford

a calf is a calf until it is weaned
it is assertive around meal time which
is all day long mischievous playful and
lias a vast conceit an hour after it is
born it can walk on shaky knees and buck-
ling forelegs nearly around its proud
mother and finds great comfort in leaning
against its maternal parent for support
in appearance it is mostly legs and wobbly
legs at that when it is five or six days
old it is tough and begins to cavort a lit-
tle not always successfully and sticks its
velvety nose into business which does not
always concern it

  when its mother goes off to a distant
waterhole she hides it in a clump of grass
or weeds with an injunction to stay put
until she returns and stay put is one of
the things the calf does to perfection if
lifted up by some curious cowboy it tries
to flatten and to assume the limpness of
jelly and if annoyed too much it bawls
for help when that bawl sounds across
the range the curious puncher knows just
exactly what his next step should be-he
hustles to his horse and he hustles pronto

a cow of the old spanish strain is nothing
for a man on foot to fool with when her
calf calls for help she will fight an-
thing for it and the calf knows it not
only the mother is to be considered am
other mother or any bull within sound of
the pleading cry is due to arrive as a res-
cuer and without loss of time

  this worthless gluttonous imp of satan
is the light of its mothers life especially
if it should be her first-born its chief
accupation is to eat until it can hold no
more and the filling shrinks amazingly
fast with the rapid growth of its mus-
cles comes a greater radius for raising
cain and a greater ambition which results
in many family quarrels before the calf is
weaned branded when two or three
months old and perhaps in the shuffle lost
from its mother for hours it begins to
find that life is not all joy a week later
finds it healed and well ready to disturb
the peace of the range the next roundup
finds the bumptious youth weaned and no
longer a calf but a swaggering sport of a
yearling the bane of herd life

three wise men of the
north

by august eberhardt

author of sitka red the fox-poacher ctc

  wresting a fortune from the northern gold fields need not at all be a back-
  breaking proposition slippery wilson instructed his willing partners-but
  before he was finished he was to find that there was a lot about easy money

making of which he knew nothing

    during half a lifetime devoted mainly
  to the uninspiring task of polishing the
  decks of unde sams coast guard cutters
  dutch henry the third member of the trio
  had nursed a secret and unsated yearning
  for a permanent vacation that would be
  unmarred by the disgusting presence of
  holystones or any other reminder of sordid
  drudgery

   being thus eminently suited to each
 other by common sympathies it was only
 natural that when fate threw them to-
 gether at the lonely yukon trading post
 they should join forces in their endeavor
 to see their dominant ambition realized

    slippery wilsons claim to his ability
  to make a white mans living under all cir-
  cumstances was demonstrated when he suc-
  ceeded in inducing a hard-boiled store
  keeper to advance the necessary grubstake
  to the three eager but impecunious stam-
  peders with an allowance of grub suffi-
  cient to last them during the eight months
  of winter-in exchange for their signed
  promise of a fourth share in all the trea-
  sure they might wrest from the frozen
  bosom of the earth-the happy argonauts
  had turned their heavily loaded poling boat
  

f the three tardy
argonauts who arrived
at the newly discovered
gold fields of ophir in
the wake of the stam-
pede slippery wilson
represented the guiding
genius by reason of his
experience acquired through many years
of sojourn in the north and also because
of his proven ability to make what he called
a white mans living under circumstances
wheae others less cunning than he were
forced to earn their daily flapjacks and
beans by the sweat of their brows ex-
cept for the distinction of being the only
sourdough among the three slippery
shared with his two partners most of their
outstanding qualities and principal among
these a deep-rooted ambition to reap where
he had not sown

  it was this same happy dream of an ef-
fortless existence that had sundered the
cockney kid from the cruelly revolving
wheels of industry and had shaped his
path toward the north star where he had
heard one could amass a fortune in gold
by the simple expedient of stooping to pick
the nuggets from the ground
three wise men of the north

up-stream and set out gallantly upon the
arduous voyage to distant ophir

  by the time they had turned the first
bend of the river their effervescent ardor
had considerably subsided while they
rested the nose of their boat on shore and
took a breathing spell in the shade of some
cottonwood trees slippery wilson grasped
the occasion to dilate upon the pernicious
consequences of undue haste their re-
spected leaders words emanating as he
assured them from a store of bitterly ac-
quired experience struck his cheechako
partners with the force of their logic and
during their further progress against the
swift current of the river the part which
the argonauts played in the great ophir
stampede was scarcely calculated to serve
as an example of the dynamic energy of
that mad rush

  thus when the partners beached their
boat some weeks later in front of the
swarming center of activities that was new-
blown ophir city they found that all the
creeks and gullies for miles around had
been staked by the hurrying throng that
had overtaken them on their leisurely voy-
age up-river also they were told no
new strike of any prominence had been re-
corded since the event of the original dis-
covery which had started the rush

  this last bit of news caused a superior
smile to disarrange the freckles on slip-
perys cunning face

  it seems we aint lost nothin so far by
refusin ter sacrifice our dignity as sensible
humans an rushin for them diggins like
hogs for the feedin trough gold is where
yuh find it yuh know he declared in an
effort to cheer up his partners an i figger
weve jess as good a chance ter strike pay
ten miles from discovery as on the claim
next to it

  it turned out that the partners had to
ascend the river just about the distance in-
dicated by slippery before they reached
the mouth of a creek that was not yet en-
tirely preempted by eager goldseekers
there were some men on the ground how-
ever and from them the partners gathered
that the creek bed contained black sand
and an abundance of colors which was a
promising sign

  as there were still more prospectors ex-
pected to arrive the partners hastened to
stake out their lawful share of the ground
in the valley above the locations already
claimed which brought the situation of
their claim about midway up the length of
the creek the lateness of the season
made it peremptory for the weary trio to



start immediately upon the heartbreaking
work of building their cabin

  when finally the partners threw the last
shovelful of dirt upon the flat roof of the
cabin which they had built upon the center
claim of the three they had staked other
stragglers had staked the remaining ground
to the head of the creek and the sound of
their busy ax strokes rang through the
clear frosty air of the valley from morn-
ing to night

ith a foot of snow cov-
ering the ground it was
evident even to the
cockney kid that the
gathering in of the
golden treasure de-
manded something
more than the mere mo-
tion of stooping down in company of
dutch henry he set out the next morning
to watch the process followed by the ex-
perienced sourdoughs whose claims were
above and below his own

  it was upon this trip of investigation
that the two cheechakoes realized a great
many painful truths with regard to placer
mining upon every claim they found
men busily engaged stripping the surface
of the ground of snow and moss steel
steam-points were being driven in the
frozen soil the dumpy little prospecting
boilers hissed clouds of steam pipes
clanked and sputtered while in some
places where the work was considerably
advanced men were straining their backs
at moaning windlasses heaving heavy buc-
kets of steaming soil from dark shafts

  all about them was bustle and commo-
tion a feverish excitement seemed to
drive the busy prospectors in their ardu-
ous task they had little time to answer
the innumerable questions put to them by
the two unhappy students of mining meth-
ods however the latter acquired enough
enlightenment from their brief course of
investigation to rob them forever of the
happy delusion that a fortune in raw gold
could be acquired by lazy methods

  it was a very discouraged pair of em-
bryo prospectors who entered the cabin in
the gloam of the early evening slippery
wilson who had devoted the day to nu-
merous successful attempts at beating the
chinaman looked up from his cards and
greeted his crestfallen partriers with a
knowing smile

  well did yuh see anybody diggin up a
fortune today he asked cheerfully

  fowtune the little cockney exploded


frontier stories

with disgust fairly flashing from his beady
black eyes blyme if i believe theres
any gowld in this ere valley all we seen
take out was mud an gravel an never a
single nugget as big as a pea

  ach i wish i had stayed by my ship 
dutch henry voiced his profound grief
with a dolorous expression on his flappy
fat cheeks at sea we work too but
nefer so hart as those crazy brosbectors 
bet you

  slippery slowly gathered his cards rose
and stepped up to his partners who were
warming themselves by the roaring yukon

stove

  it does seem tough ter go a-diggin in
this here frozen soil fer weeks an perhaps
months only ter find in the end that the
ground doesnt contain any gold he ad-
mitted myself now i have always been
able ter live like a white man an so far i
havn t found it necessary ter dirty my
hands on a muckstick at that i dont see
that weve anything ter complain of the
way we re fixed this here stampede has
already earned us a grubstake thatll last
us fer the rest o the winter i feel that
we owe it to ourselfs ter make the most o
the good luck this stampede has already
brought us an eat up that grubstake with
as much comfort as the situation affords

  slipperys plea for comfort found a
ready response in his partners passionate
devotion to calm repose their faces lit
up immediately

   pon my word yer hidea aint arf bad
the cockney kid commented approvingly
meself i likes me bit o comfort afore
everything but- his sly gargoyle of a
face suddenly sobered while he scratched
his curly black hair- ow are we goin ter
find out then if theres any gowld in our
ground 

   slippery completed the final touches on a
cigarette in the making

  well let them other fellers tend to
that part of the job he calmly assured
the questioner

  haw-haw the kid appeared to find
a great deal of fun in his partners state-
ment hi can jolly well see them fellows
a-takin pity on us sinkin prospect oles
in our claims so we get more time fer
playin cards

  the kids ridicule did not disturb slip-
pery calmly he bent to the tamped earth
floor and picked up a piece of charcoal
from in front of the stove them fellers
wont need to dig in our ground ter show
us wether theres any gold in our claims
an whereabouts the paystreak runs ef

 v vik-vlid      - 			 -v

there is sech a thing as a paystreak in this
valley

  til explain this for yuh fellers he
offered as he stepped to the table upon
whose freshly hewn planks he began to
draw an undulating line down the middle
of the oblong plane

his line stands fer the
creek were on-squaw
creek as them fellows
who came here first
have named it he in-
formed his partners

  next slippery drew
two parallel lines along
the edges of the table which he explained
signified the benches framing the valley
across the longitudinal lines marking the
course of the creek he drew eighteen lat-
eral lines and the rectangles thus created
he marked from the bottom upward with
the numbers one to seventeen

  now he said here we got squaw
creek as it is terday each o them rec-
tangles means a claim yuli see the claims
marked frum one ter seven them is the
claims that was staked afore we come here
numbers eight nine an ten is our own
claims the claims marked frum leven
ter seventeen is the ground staked by the
fellers that come after us yuh got me so
far

  the two cheechakoes nodded under-
standing

  well then continued their experi-
enced leader yuh notice that each claim
runs thirteen hundred and twenty feet
across the valley frum bench to bench up
an down the creek each claim measures six
hundred an sixty feet if they is a pay-
streak buried along that creek itll nash-
rally run in the direction o the valley
where glaciers or some eroshum as they
calls it has left it that paystreak if its
there might be as much as a hundred feet
wide an again it might be no more
broader n a deer trail likewise it may
happen ter be located in the middle o the
valley or it might run anywheres between
them two benches

  now always considerin that they is
sech a thing as a paystreak yuh fellers can
figger it out fer yerself that itll take an
uncommon streak o luck fer them muck-
stick maniplaters that yuh been watchin
terday ter run on to it at the bottom o one
o their first holes howsomever four-
teen men a-diggin fer all theyre worth
are bound ter find it sooner or later an
once they has struck it at the bottom of a

azi	 li- af
 i  -

three wise men of the north

hole itll be much easier to select the place
where the next hole ought ter be sunk
with three or four shafts down to pay
theyll have a line on the pay streak an
after that it wont be no trouble ter trace
the paystreak down the length of the val-
ley

  slippery looked up from his improvised
chart and swung a didactic finger under
his partners noses

  now supposin them busy muckstick
artists above an below our claims has
traced the paystreak right down to the up-
per an lower limit of our location-wont
it be jess a cinch fer us lucky guys ter
trace a line in the snow across our claims
an say along this line we must dig an
be sure ter strike pay at the bottom of
every hole

  the two disciples in the art of making
a white mans living had listened to the
masters dissertation with ever increasing
interest dutch henrys satisfaction at the
pleasing prospect expressed itself in a sil-
ent chuckle that caused a protracted quake
in the region of his equator his watery
pale blue eyes closed to mere slits his
round cheeks puffed out beyond the tip
of his stubby little nose while his mouth
extended in a gash that threatened self-
decapitation but suddenly a thought
seemd to have struck him that caused all
signs of merriment to vanish from his
face

  und ven of der baystreak der is nod-
dings in der creek  he inquired

  slippery was not the least taken aback
by this unexpected question indeed he
seemed to rise several inches in answer to
the problem thus put to his genius to solve
laying a fatherly hand upon the well-
nourished shoulders of his rotund partner
he calmed the latters fears

  my dear dutch in case theres no pay-
streak in this valley he replied with lofty
confidence then well still have a trump
card ter play that none o them deluded
muckstick artists will be able ter beat
so-o how you make dot oud
listen the news o this here ophir
gold strike has traveled all over the united
states by this time thousands o people
outside will want ter come here ter try
their fortune wken river navigation
opens in the spring this here diggins 
be flooded with gold-hungry cheechakoes
theyll stake every foot o ground in the
district an them that cant find any ground
ter stake will be glad ter buy ground
slippery paused to roll a cigarette mean-
while allowing the facts of his argument to



become absorbed by his partners after
leisurely sending a few artistic ringlets of
smoke toward the cabin roof he continued
with sublime assurance

  we all know that cheechakoes is fond
o takin a good deal fer granted that is
told them about this wonderful country
but my business o makin a white mans
livin has nashrally brought me a good
deal in contact with that sort o people an
accordin to my observations most o them
is putty well able ter tell black from white
now with the claims above an below ours
all pitted with holes like the pox had gone
over the ground even a cheechako try in
ter buy a claim will come ter reckon that
if the men who dug them holes had found
anything at the bottom theyd not offer
their claims fer sale but when they
comes ter look at our ground itll be a
different thing here theyll see what
theyll call perfectly virgin ground not
marred by a single scratch o the pick
theres mystery an promise in sech a plot
o unworked ground in the middle of a
gold bearin district itll get up their
curiosity the ground might hold gold an
ill eat my boots if one or another o them
wont buy our ground fer enough money
ter pay us at least wages fer the time an
trouble we spent in locatin an watchin
the claims

  slipperys ingenious scheme as revealed
to his partners relieved the latter of the
last trace of the gloom that the foreboding
of work had engendered when their en-
thusiasm calmed down slippery once more
produced the deck of cards

  come on fellers he invited take a
hand in this solo game we have ter find
out whos ter cook the supper tonight

ith a plentiful supply
of grub in their cache
with the yukon stove
roaring merrily the
three partners felt per-
fectly comfortable in
their cozy cabin and
were scarcely aware of
the passing of the short days and the in-
creasing cold of the long and dreary winter
night

  most of their time was dedicated to the
important task of conserving dieir health
and strength by a plentiful indulgence in
sleep while their waking hours were al-
most entirely engaged by ihe serious busi-
ness of playing solo	

  thus the days passed for the trio in
o	frontier stories

passionless quiescence rarely did they
wander far from their retreat and months
after their arrival some of the miners
operating along squaw creek had never
seen their faces

  one day shortly before christmas when
the brief two hours of half-hearted day-
light had once more begun to dwindle into
the gloam of an arctic afternoon there
was a knock at their cabin door which
roused the partners out of their beauty
sleep

  come in  called dutch henry whose
bunk was nearest the door and at the
same time he reached out a hairy leg from
under his blankets and lifted the wooden
doorlatch with his big toe upon this two
men entered the one in the drill parka
partly covered by a great grizzled and ice-
encrusted beard was dad hobson who
owned the claim just above them in his
companion they recognized dick tate a
younger man with an aggressive face
sporting a little black mustache his claim
joined the property of the partners on the
lower limit

  the faces of the two visitors expressed
some surprise when they saw the occupants
of the cabin still comfortably ensconced in
their bunks at a time when night was ap-
proaching

  howdy boys greeted tate hope
there aint nothin the matter with yore
health seem you keep to yer bunks this
time o day	f

  thanks fer the hinquiry about our
ealdi the cockney reported with a long-
drawn yawn but as ye see were just in
the hact o preservin it

  hm-i suppose a fire wouldnt come
amiss tate suggested as he applied him-
self to the task of cutting shavings from a
pile of dry spruce wood behind the stove
in a few moments he had the little tin
stove roaring and sitting down at the
table he addressed the occupants of the
cabin

  dad here an i come over to see how
yuh boys was gettin along he said we
been noticin yuh aint showed up much in
the open an we thought that perhaps yuh
had some good reason why yuh havent
started diggin this far we know that
often people start out on a stampede with-
out bein properly outfitted to spend the
winter so hobson an me comes to the
conclusion that if this is the case with yuh
-why we two might be able to spare some
grub or if its tools yuh need to work
yore claims i have no doubt we can scrape
up some picks an shovels to give yuh fel-

lows a chanct to find out whats in yore
ground

  vuh see tate went on unperturbed
by the partners apparent lack of interest
yuh see our idea is that if every man that 
owns a claim along this creek does his part 

in the prospectin the sooner we all know 
what the ground holds there is pay along
this creek someplace colors have been 
taken from every hole so far dug as i
said each mans work helps out the rest o i
the miners along the creek so if they is
anything we can do for yuh fellows to put
yuh in position to work them here claims-
o yours why jess say so an there wont
be a man in this valley as wont gladly help
yuh along

  the partners had listened in silence
when tate finished slippery rose in his
upper bunk stretched himself and replied
with a yawn like a dying codfish gasping
for air

  ho-hm-thanks boys for yer generous
offer its sure pleasant ter have sech
kindly disposed neighbors but the fact is
the three o us has joined ter form a sas-
siety fer the preservation o the nash-ral
beauties o the ground an our statutesf
ferbid us ter mar or in any way violate the
virgin surface of our holdins exceptin
always the case where circumstances offers
the proof that sech violation of our rules
is bound ter lead us smack onto the pay-
streak

  with that slippery reached for the little
shelf above his bunk from which he took
the butt of a cigarette which he lighted
and began to smoke with silent relish

  for a moment after slippery had ceased
speaking the two neighbors stared at each
other across the table in perplexed wonder
then suddenly the veiled mockery of slip-
perys reply seemed to grip young tates
mind for his handsome face turned scarlet
with anger and he was about to leap from
his seat in an angry retort when his
bearded partner laid a detaining hand on
his shoulder

  no use gittin sore dick old dads
deep booming voice rolled from out of his
forest of whiskers

  we see now what you fellows is after
he accused the occupants of the bunks j
oh yes its a right smart scheme he
added bitterly but not the sort of game
that an honest sourdough would attempt

  the two visitors had risen and moved 
toward the door standing in its open i
frame dick tate turned and shot a glance j
of utter contempt at the weary trio

  well i wish you luck he snapped as 
three wise men of the north

r

 he slammed the door behind him

   same to yuh pardner slipperys
 cheerful voice rang after him

   now eferybody along der greek will be
 sore ad us afder disdutch henry re-
 marked after their visitors had departed

   well let em was slipperys uncon-
 cerned reply as he leaped from his upper
 bunk and donned his clothes by the warmth
 of the roaring stove what difference
 does it make to us they cant take our
 claims from us them is staked an re-
 corded accordin to law an by the same
 law we has a whole years time ter do our
 assessment work in long afore that year
 is over well either know where ter dig or
 avhether its worth diggin at all

hat dutch henry was
 not so far off the mark
 when he predicted that
 the rest of the miners
 would resent their
 shirking their share of
 the work in prospecting
 squaw creek was eas-
 ily perceptible in the unfriendly attitude
 of the workers on the rare occasions when
 the partners ventured beyond the bounds
 of their holdings the hostile attitude did
 not however prevent the trio from gather-
 ing all the necessary information concern-
 ing the new diggings as a whole and their
 own creek in particular

   it appeared that of the many creeks
 which had been staked since the start of
 the stampede a few had already proven
 rich in pay dirt however a still greater
 number had not panned out so well
 among the latter group belonged squaw
 creek though colors had been found in
 every claim along squaw creek and even
 nuggets in quantities that would have made
 the digging a paying proposition in any
 region more easily accessible than ophir
 the pay did not run in quantities to meet
 the great expense of working the ground

   the news that squaw creek had proven
 a hopeless proposition caused the three
 partners a feeling of mild regret tt was
 too bad they admitted that their present
 venture had not brought them the fortune
 that would have meant to them permanent
 j surcease from all sordid toil still there
 was consolation in the fact that they had
 arrived at the melancholy knowledge at
 far less expense than the broken and dis-
 couraged figures whom they watched to-
 ward spring leaving the creek with their
 belongings packed on their sleds to locate
 new ground before the avalanche of chee-

 chakoes should inundate the district

  not all of the disappointed prospectors
on squaw creek were able to set out for
pastures new some there were who had
spent their all in last winters venture and
were unable to produce the necessary grub-
stake for a new attempt these unlucky
few stuck to their cabins that for the time
being must remain their home until with
the coming of summer they could hire out
their labor in an endeavor to gather an-
other grubstake or to await the rush of the
newcomers and perhaps gain a hundred
dollars or so by selling to them their doubt-
ful claims

  blyme if i dont believe them pore
blokess hactually opin ter sell their pock-
marked claims to some newcomer arter
break-up the kid remarked as he watched
hobson and tate sitting in front of the
formers cabin smoking their pipes in the
warm spring air they were often seen
together of late idly passing the time and
everything pointed to the fact that they
were waiting for the time when the claim-
hungry cheechakoes would overrun the
country

  a bally chanct theyll ave o sellin
their claims alongside o ourn was the
little cockneys final comment as he took
a hand in the solo game that was to reveal
the fall-guy for the job of cooking the
supper

  finally even the last vestige of snow
had disappeared from the hillsides the
ruffed grouse began to drum in the willow
thickets by the creek while the wild geese
sailed in great and noise wedges toward
the arctic slopes the ice had left the
river some time ago and the arrival of
the first up-river steamer was expected any
day

  berhabs we bedder go dowp to ophir
city to be ready ven der cheechackers
come dutch suggested as he carefully
measured out a mess of beans from the
small remnant in the sack purty soon
we got no more eats left und we ought to
make shure und pilot some of the claim
buyers to our blace up

  slippery who had been lying on his
bunk all morning absorbed in quiet medi-
tations of his own emerged from his
trance at dutch henrys words

  itll be a dickens of a trail to ophir
at this time o year where everythin is
mud an swamp an i should hate ter go
besides taint necessary he remarked
jerking his thumb in the direction of hob-
sons cabin hobson an tate left fer
town this momin all we got ter do is
m

frontier stories



ter sit tight until our neighbors tows in
some o them cheechakoes when well find
some means ter let them know that were
willin ter sacrifice our claims

  dutch henry nodded his fat head in
token of approval

  you sure are a smart guy slippery
he lauded always you find somebody
else vat does der tough work for us
jess a matter o usin yer brains slip-
pery drawled widi becoming modesty

hat slippery had been
right in his surmise
concerning their neigh-
bors trip to town was
evidenced the very next
day when the partners
saw them returning in
company of a man
whose new and outlandishly cut clothing
easily marked him as a man just arrived
from the states

  a real genniwine come-on a hinnocent
lamb as was ever born the cockney kid
voiced the impression which the prospect
made upon his hopeful mind look at
im vs still a-wearin of the first fleece
hi say he turned to his partners you
blokes leave im to me i knows just ow
ter lure the candy from this bloomin hin-
fant

  from the concealment of a thicket the
trio watched tate showing the prospective
buyer over the claim the two men stop-
ped here and there at the different dumps
and washed a pan now and then an opera-
tion which seemed to attract the undivided
interest of the stranger finally tate re-
turned to his cabin leaving his guest to
prosecute his investigation by himself
without apparently being aware of the
fact the cheechako had gradually extended
his investigation of the ground beyond the
limit of hobsons claim and was now en-
gaged in carefully examining a pan of
coarse gravel which he had taken from a
bar that lay directly in front of the thicket
where the three partners were concealed

  nows yore time suggested slippery
as he shoved the little man out in the open

  thus started the little cockney with
his hands in his pockets strolled casually
toward the stranger who seemed unaware
of his approach

  ullo ows she pannin out

  the busy embryo prospector looked up
in surprise and surveyed the intruder with
guileless brown eyes that narrowed in a
mystified way behind large horn-rimmed
glasses

  i am not at all certain of that myself
the stranger replied as he fell to studying-
again the gravel in his gold pan i am
just trying to determine which of the rocks-r
in my pan here are the famous bedrocks
that i have heard so much about jolly
name by the way-bedrock-dont you 
think so  never saw the sort of rocks yet
that i would care to make a bed of j
if its bedrocks yer lookin for mr-
er-

  lilypond-dulcius lilypond of seat-
tle the stranger introduced himself with a
smile that showed perfect well-kept teeth
behind a brown van dyke beard

  glad to meet yer mr lilypond the
kid acknowledged if its bedrock yer
lookin for yer ave done well ter come up
this far along the creek cause yell never-
find it on ole obsons claim im an tate
as been diggin it up all winter as yer
can see by the oles they left all over the
claim i as no doubt them coves is tryin j
ter sell ye their claims after they has
cleaned them out

  why-eh-its for the purpose of buy-j
ing a parcel of gold-bearing ground that
i came here

  in that case yer struck it lucky ter meet
me mister lilypond ere you beoldsj
a parcel o ground offered fer sale hexactly
as bountiful nature as left it thousands o
years ago not a scratch of pick nor
shovel ter mar the surface an all the gold-
bearin bedrock still in place in each o the
three claims as is owned by meself an me
twro partners yer hexperience as a gold
miner  no doubt elp yer to happreciate
the difference between our virgin ground
an the cleaned-out claims that obson an
tate is offerin you

  there is a difference no doubt mr
lilypond admitted thoughtfully but to be
right frank with you sir i must confess
that my experience as a prospector has up
to now been confined to what i have read
of this most romantic of all callings for
years it has been my secret ambition to
follow the call of the stampede to feel the
thrill of the prospector when he sees the
paystreak spreading out before him but
until lately my business has kept me
chained to an unromantic existence in the
city

  an whats yer business if i map make
so bowld ter arsk

  why i am an expert in ladies hats i
mr dulcius lilypond acknowledged bash-
fully while he wiped his glasses on a silk j
handkerchief

  oh was all the little cockney was 
able to reply when he was interrupted by
a violent tit of coughing that necessitated
the use of a large printed and not overly
clean pocket handkerchief which he em-
ployed ostentatiously while standing with
his back to his new acquaintance

  i has me spells o hasthma now an
then he explained apologetically they
comes on me sudden-like when i least hex-
pect em a hexpert in lydies ats ye
say another slight fit of coughing in-
terrupted the little man at this juncture
why now i kin jolly well see where yer
gift fer judgin gold-bearin ground is
come from its the hartistic sense in yer
i dont esitate ter sye that ye ave devel-
oped quite an appy himpression of the
possibilities of ground along this ere
creek

  it doesnt look bad to me i must con-
fess mr lilypond acknowledged evi-
dently a little flattered besides years
ago a gypsy woman told me that some day
i should reap a fortune from out of the

ground she was very definite-

  praps the woman mentioned as jow
yed ave ter dig fer it ter get to that for-
tune o yours the kid broke in

  yes yes to be sure she mentioned
that i would have to dig my fortune out
of the ground

  this last admission by mr lilypond
seemed to settle the question for the kid
beyond all possibility of doubt

  ha he exclaimed enthusiastically
him jolly well satisfied now this ere is
the very ground the gypsy ad in mind
right ere ye got more bloomin hoppor-
t unity ter dig than on any other claim in
ophir district

  hows that

  dontsher see all them other claims
is dug chuck full o oles leavin this ere
the only property where ye can muddle
an dig to yer hearts content

  hm-it does strike me as somewhat
curious that you and your partners havent
given the ground a try seeing that you feel
so confident that it contains gold

  good lor mister hits just because
we as confidence that there is gowld in
this ground that we dasnt stick a pick into
it

  the stranger looked blandly question-
ing the kid approached closer and fam-
iliarly took hold of a button on mr lily-
ponds fancy belted jacket

  you bein a hexpert in lydies ats makes
it doubtful whether youll grasp the view-
point of real old-type sourdoughs as ye
see in me an me two partners he volun-

three wise men of the north	

owever ill do me best to hex-

 teered
 plain it

e see when we comes
ere to size up the lay
o the land our hex-
perience as prospectors
tells us right orf that
this ere is the mos
promisin ground we
has so far come acrost
as if that werent enough the first night
we sleeps on this ground dutch enry
which is the oldest of us three e as a
dream an in it e sees the ground we been
sleepin on all plastered with large nuggets
two more nights dutch as the same
dream but it is not until were about fin-
ished buildin the cabin that e busts on us
with the question whether itd be proper
to wear moccasins with a tuxedo an what
sort o joolry it would best match an au-
burn-aired lady

  mr wilson an meself natrally gets to
proddin ol dutch as to what got them
forrin hideas in is ead now quite
shamfaced-like the ol fool confesses to us
that e asnt told us all of what e as seen
in is dreams that the space above the
gowlden floor ad not been quite so hempty
as it seemed from is first tellin of is
dream no the first night e dreamt that
e saw a red-eaded young woman a-dancin
on the gowlden floor in is second dream
dutch beolds the same scene again but
this time the woman seems to take a good
deal o notice o poor ol enry inwitin im
with er smiles to dance with er the
third night e dreamt e ad given in to the
womans wiles and was a-oppin it all over
the gowlden floor with er

  now it might seem ridiculous to you to
think of a bald-eaded fat ol johnny like
dutch a-oppin it around with a red-eaded
young siren but to meself an mr wilson
the hidea was no laughin matter we
knew that there was somethin id away
in the make-up of good ol dutch of which
probably even isself warnt aware but
which was bount to break out if the right
hopportunity offered

  all of them years that the three of us
ad been partners wed been as appy an
content as a litter o pup malemutes we
ad come to like prospectin so well that
we were hactually scared o strikin it rich
for then we wouldnt ave ad no longer
an excuse fer roamin around the ills
which was the only life that kept us appy
an ealthy

  but now avin eard dutch tell of is
frontier stories

and accomplished the business of searching
their pockets without the aid of the owners
with a reproachful look toward his part-
ners he added their combined fortunes to
his own capital and sallied forth from the
place jingling a half dollar and two quar-
ters in his breeches pocket

  thoroughly sobered now as he was the
stout sailors empty stomach clamored in-
sistently for the solids which dutch had
failed to provide during the garish days
just passed the man made his way
through the stir and agitation of the busy
mining center until he arrived at a tent-
roofed board frame whose sign flared
forth the claim of the cheapest eating place
in the city

  dutch entered the shack which was
empty save for the shirt-sleeved cook
working at the range behind the counter
dutch produced his entire fortune and laid
it on the table before him

  here he told the cook dis is all i
got gif me der most vat dis will buy
the proprietor of the modest culinary
establishment cast a scornful glance at the
three silver coins

  well brother your chicken feed wont
buy much of a banquet in this corner of
the world but ill see to it that you wont
leave here hungry he replied not un-
kindly how would a nice tonic of flop-
jacks an bacon affect your constitution
fine so long dere is blenty i have
such a hunger i could eat a boot

  no need for any healthy man to go
hungry in these diggins there is plenty
of work for everybody and good wages
too the cook suggested while he beat the
sourdough into a creamy batter

  he did not notice the slight shudder that
went through the sailors frame at his
mention of work but went on with his talk

  yep plenty work only last night the
owners of the three easy men claim was
in town lookin for fifty miners to work
on their new property

  three easy men is it called dot vay
a mine dutch inquired with mild interest
while his eyes appraised the size of the
flapjacks the cook poured upon the hot
griddle

   ep that s the name of whats goin
to be the greatest producer in ophir dis-
trict	

  i dink dot is a funy name i vunder
for vy dcy call it so

t	fimny s righte cok chuc-

kled y ou should have been at the pay-
streak hotel last night and heard the own-
ers of three easy men tell the story of

howthey got a hold of their rich squaw
creek property and you would know why
they named it that way

  squaw creek the customer asked
with a sudden show of interest but dere
is no gold in squaw creek

  thats what everybody thought except
hobson and tate

  dutch henrys face had become very
white now

  i know dis fellows haf they anyding
to do mith dot rich mine you speak of
he asked breathlessly

  sure hobson tate and lilypond is
the name of the company that owns claims
seven to eleven on squaw creek which
today is recognized as the richest piece of
ground in the whole ophir diggins

  ach der shipsy was right groaned
the worried looking customer

  what did you say

  noddings

  apparently unaware of his guests sud-
den discomfiture the loquacious cook con-
tinued to entertain him with the news that
had just begun to rouse the district in
laughter and the funniest part of the
thing is that the three former owners lived
on that rich ground all winter without
ever taking the trouble of stickin a pick
into the ground if they had dug just a
few feet into the floor of their cabin they
would have found more gold in the space
that was covered by their roof than the
three thousand dollars a cheechako paid
them for their claims a few weeks ago
he was lucky dutch groaned in re-
sponse

  lucky nothin that man lilypond
had reasons to suspect that their ground
was worth a good deal more than they
would ever dare to ask for it you see
the cook enlarged on his report as he put
a heaping plate of golden brown flapjacks
in front of his customer you see early
last winter hobson an tate who owned
the claims seven and eleven discovered in
each of their claims what at first looked to
them like the beginnin of a regular pay-
streak in each of their claims the pay
broadened and became richer as it ap-
proached the limits of the three claims that
lay in between them gradually as they
followed it with their drifts they began
to suspect that squaw creek did not con-
tain the usual paystreak running down the
length of the valley but they figured that
because of some volcanic displacement of
the ground whatever paystreak there once
was had all been heaped into a spot about
a fraction of their own property and
three wise men of the north

mainly the three claims that ky m between
them

  now hobson an tate are two honest
old-time prospectors an they concluded
among themselves that it would be no
more n right to give the owners of the
claims between theirs a hint that it would
pay them to do some digging but when
they comes to see the owners of these
claims they found them a worthless lot o
vagabonds not willin to do anything for
themselves an just waitin for other hard-
working miners along the creek to discover
the paystreak for them

  later they hears that the three scamps
is eager to sell their claims the two old-
timers figures that they might as well own
the ground as some stranger who has done
nothin to help discover it but they had to
go easy about the deal because if they
themselves had offered to buy the claims
the owners would naturally have become
suspicious but hobson an tate are rela-
tives you see hobson had a nephew who
was at that time holdin down a fancy job
as a buyer for the millinery department of
the bon marche in seattle this nephews
name is lilypond and he is also the
brother-in-law of tate

  spite of his funny occupation this
lilypond is quite a regular fellow hed
been grubstakin the two relatives of his
on several occasions and when they had a



chance to pick up a good thing like them
claims on squaw creek hobson an tate
were glad to have their relative join them
so they sends him a cable message tellin
him to chuck up his funny job an come to
ophir on the first boat after the breakup
of course when he got here neither hob-
son nor tate considered it necessary to in-
troduce lilypond as their joint relative
posin as a cheechako lilypond had no
trouble at all in gettin hold of the ground
owned by the three worthless scamps
fact is them fellows almost sandbagged
him into buyin their million dollar prop-
erty as soon as they caught sight of him
perhaps its for that reason hobson tate
and lilypond named their new property
three easy men because them smarties
sure proved themselves the easiest simps
that ever walked on snowshoes

  but look here stranger the talkative
cook added a moment later when he be-
held his customer with his head resting
heavily betwen his hands and staring with
a mournful countenance beyond the heaped
plate which the cook had set before him
i thougnt you said you was hungry
why your flapjacks is gettin plumb cold
if you dont fall to purty soon

  with a weary gesture the man shoved
the plate away from him and rose to go

  no danks he groaned dolefully all
of a once i got a stomach ache
king of the thundering
bar

                            by robert v carr

                            author of the seven gay riders restless guns etc

            when boisterous jovial old jake ender made a strike on thundering bar the
            old-timers of driftwood rejoiced with him-but in the crowd were some new-
            comers of a different stripe who saw in his good fortune a promise of easy

                                        money for themselves

ake ender was en-
tertaining his numerous
friends and acquaint-
ances in the white
front mike holsoms
saloon in driftwood a
mining town strung
down a long canyon
and more often called old drift or
slim town	-

  the big prospector pounded on the
mahogany bar hauled into the camp by
bull train during the placer boom and de-
manded action of the bartenders

  take notice everybody he yelled
 my grub and stable bills are paid room
meals and barber paid in advance mike
there has a sack of my good money in his
safe im good for two weeks jamboree
if i use fair judgment

  and it s all clean money boys right
ctm hand of old mother nature
shovel it into the sluice and pan it down
out comes the clean hard gold with no
skullduggery about it at all a placer
miner i claim is the straightest man on
earth unless its mike there theres none
squarer than him

  one on the house  called mike from

his post between the end of the bar and tiie
big safe i appreciate the compliment
 tis no compliment mike laughed
the happy jake its the bedrock truth
he tossed off a drink move down this
way ive a surprise for you

  he plucked a nugget from his vest
pocket and laid it on the bar it was heart-
shaped and the size of a dollar

  for you mike he said simply

  mikes hobby was odd-shaped nuggets
this one was a beauty he picked it up
examined it closely and then looked about
him rather helplessly what could he do
for jake

  never mind laughed the big man
 tis only part payment for what youve
done for me all these years he turned
to the crowd boys mike here has taken
care of my money since the placer boom
grub-staked me more times than i can re-
member and been one of the best friends
i ever had now hes worryin about do-
in something for me because i make him
a little gift thinks i when i found that
nugget that goes to mike a touch of
sentiment in it boys  tis a gold heart
thinks i and mike has a heart of gold and
so it belongs to him 
king of the thundering bar



  mike was unable to speak he could
only reach across the bar and pat the arm
of his friend

  what a grand thing roared jake to
relieve the emotional tension it is to be
a placer miner boys im king of the
thunderin bar-a group of claims strung
down the crick  found it and its mine
ive the finest cabin in the country the
biggest cellar the best of everything i
live like a fightin cock three hours a
day shovelin into the sluice-just enough
to keep me in trim-gives me all i need
i know there is a ton or two of gold in the
thunderin bar but why worry about it
its safe there as good a bank as i know
of ive enough to do me why try to dig
it all out at once

  there are men who wouldnt rest till
theyd a flume and a hydraulic outfit
theyd fret till they had the last color
but thats not my way and never will be
one hundred days of light work and then
into old drift for a jamboree and the
first place i strike is mike s here a man
is treated like a prince heres what i like
to look forward to here i find friends
to warm my heart and good licker to warm
my belly

  jake knew what he was talking about
the white front had a distinctive atmos-
phere to the prospectors it represented
good feeling comfort and security it was
cool and inviting in summer warm and
comfortable in winter along the wall op-
posite the bar was a line of big chairs and
no tobacco chewer was forced to go to the
door or the stove to unload when the
winter wind howled down the canyon the
big stove fed with sound pine glowed
redly day and night if a prospector
wanted to doze in one of the big chairs
that was his sacred right it was strictly
a saloon with women and games barred

  while the red shirts had stripped the
canyon of its placer gold and passed on
driftwood was still a mans camp a trad-
ing point for quartz miners and prospec-
tors it had lost some of the pictur-
esqueness of the roaring seventies having
laid aside its buckskins and hidden its six-
shooters under its coat-tails and acquired
those invariable adjuncts of civilization
church jail and courthouse but it still re-
tained its old frontier liberality and free-
dom all night long its lights burned
brightly like a jeweled necklace it lay
vi the canyon whose gold had brought it
iuto being it was still affectionately
called the long slim wicked city

  a town for independent quick-tempered

generous hard healthy masculinity the
stores kept extra big sizes in suits boots
shoes and gloves restaurant and hotel
proprietors served man-sized meals they
put it all on the table and each trencherman
was expected to eat all he could hold the
doors were made to clear the hats of men
over six feet tall there was little a man
could buy for less than twenty-five cents
dimes were in circulation but nickels and
pennies were curiosities the day and
night marshals were selected for their
judgment and steadiness they were
careful not to make any blatant announce-
ment of their authority for there were
still hundreds of men in the camp who
were far from gun-shy and who were
ready and eager to fight at the slightest in-
fringement on what they considered their
rights and liberties

  jake ender liked to sing and he was no
mean chantysmith some of his songs were
not for sensitive ears or for the shrinking
violet type but in the main they were
what a normal healthy free man would
roar as he shoveled gravel into the sluice

  jake never became helplessly drunk a
jamboree to him was no slobbering affair
or sodden prostration in some back alley

  just enough to keep an edge he would
say  never get down is my motto i
want to enjoy my stay in this mans camp
and if i go paralyzed drunk all enjoyment
is at an end just nicely jingled boys a
visit here and there with friends and then
home to the cabin and never a drop till i
come again

  now hat on bar head thrown back and
hand waving like a bandmasters he roared
in basso profundo

im king of the thunderin bar by cripes
  with none to say me nay

i	do as i will an drink my fill

  an always pay my way

  hows that he laughed his great
hand smacking on the bar

  there came a crashing chorus of ap-
proval

thin slightly stooped
rat-nosed man wearing
a derby hat a four-in-
hand tie and a starched
shirt had been listening
to jakes account of the
riches of the thunder-
ing bar he was a new
arrival in the camp a lawyer of the jack-


frontier stories

leg variety his name was peter trim-
mer but the camp after one penetrating
look had dubbed him tricky trimmer

  tricky maneuvered until he gained a
position near jakes elbow

  thats a big holding you have he re-
marked in his oily voice

  take turned slowly like a bull elk he
would talk freely of his affairs to those
he considered his friends but he disliked
comment or question from a stranger

  for several moments he somberly re-
garded the rat face under the derby hat
tricky had the appearance of a man who
needed to be dipped in some strong disin-
fectant he was not jakes kind

  who told you to shove in demanded
the prospector a shade of anger in his
voice

   beg your pardon said tricky
smoothly i couldnt help hearing what
you said and naturally thought you for-
tunate in owning so much valuable prop-
erty no offense meant i assure you

  there couldnt be rumbled jake if
there was you wouldnt be standin on
your feet then his natural good nature
asserting itself he seized trickys bony
hand and ground it in his iron grip

  tricky strained rose to his tiptoes grin-
ning like a chimpanzee at the excruciating
pain when jake released his hand he
wondered if he would ever be able to use
it again he put it back of him fearful
of another joint-grinding

  whats the matter with you  growled
jake have a drink and pull yourself
together

  tricky took his drink in his left hand
and swallowed it in one gulp it seemed to
stun him momentarily his heady eyes
glistened and his neck expanded like a
lizards

  ill give you my card he finally
gasped you may want some iegal ad-
vice

  he handed the somewhat puzzled jake
a bit of pasteboard the prospector held
the card at arms length and read aloud

  peter trimmer attorney-at-law

  with a throaty grunt he tossed the card
over his shoulder swung out a huge arm
and flung tricky back

  dont need you he bellowed waving
a hand at trickys reflection in the back
bar mirror ive got all the lawyer i
need in a shoulder holster it speaks all
languages and never lost a case

  he whirled suddenly and with eger-
demain quickness jammed trickys hat
down over his eyes and ears yanked his

tie to hangmans noose tightness and

jerked out his shirt tail

  the crowd roared its delight as tricky
blindly struggled with his hat when he
could see he looked about him wildly and
then charged out on the sidewalk he dis-
covered that his lengthy shirt tail was out
frantically he stuffed it into his trousers
while the crowd in the saloon stamped
and roared then with thin lips tightly
compressed and eyes rolling wildly he
slunk away

  jake had merely stared with feigned
wonderment at the much-dishevelled vic-
tim of his horseplay

  never saw a feller he remarked with
mock solemnity with too much shirt tail
who was on the square want to find out
a mans true nature yank out his shirt
if hes wearin a young sheet chalk him
down as either crazy or crooked well
whats next on the program

  another song suggested a crony

  this time jake made careful prepara-
tion he unbuttoned his vest and loosened
his collar then with a hand on the
shoulder of a friend and the other free
to thump on the bar he threw back his
head and blared

theres just three reasons vuhy i think-
why a jigger wants c drink

  because hes dry

  a pard is nigh

or-any other reason why

  now boys give me a hand in the
chorus here we go

so line em up an drink em down

  this one is on me

yes line em up an drink em down

  to this jamboree

  they smashed into the refrain their
rough voices making the old saloon ring
even mike joined in it pleased him to
see men happy

ricky trimmer
his bony hands locked
behind him was pacing
to and fro in his little
office vainly trying to
conjure up some plan
for the trapping and
ruination of jake ender
the exhibition of the heart-shaped nug-
king of the thundering bar



get and jakes account of the wealth of
die thundering bar had roused the jack-
lcgs envy and greed and set him to sort-
ing over his collection of tricks with the
hope of finding one that would secure him
possession of the rich placer ground with-
out risk to his own precious hide

  but the shameful memory of the snatch-
ing out of his shirt tail had filled him so
full of animosity that he wobbled and
lurched mentally the sudden exposure
of the nether end of his voluminous gar-
ment had been a terrible blow to his shabby
genteel dignity he had been a justice of
the peace in a small town in the east and
was still laboring under the delusion that
his person was sacrosanct to him the
shirt tail jerking was as frightful an of-
fense against civilization as the twigging
of the nose of a supreme court judge

  he secured some relief by visioning him-
self on the bench with jake ender before
him loaded with chains awaiting sentence
for some heinous crime

  he paused and looked sternly at the im-
aginary criminal

  to be hanged by the neck until dead
dead dead he muttered

  but that sentence failed to satisfy him
when a man was dead his troubles were
over he changed it to imprisonment for
the balance of your natural life-at hard
labor that would give the big brute
time to think over all the evil he had done

  he returned to reality with a jerk he
w-asnt a judge he was a lawyer without
diploma or clients in a town that seemed
to be entirely unaware of his existence
and he had little money-mighty little

  he yearned to punish the town for its
indifference to peter trimmer attorney-
at-law he panted for power that he might
make its carefree citizens suffer he vis-
ioned himself suddenly elevated to dicta-
torship one of his first moves would be
to close mike holsoms place he filled
his glass to the brim when some one
treated him but he felt a glow of self-
righteousness now he saw himself
sternly cleaning up the town

  all places of amusement would be
closed such dangerous men as jake
ender he would put in jail such menaces
to the morals of the community as mike
holsom would be banished his officers
would be busy arresting men and bringing
them before him for sentence each ar-
rest would symbolize the power and im-
portance of mayor peter trimmer

  again he returned to reality with a jerk
how could he secure possession of en-

ders claims and thus gain wealth and re-
venge in one swroop he had been in the
camp only a few weeks and his knowledge
of mining law was as limited as his com-
prehension of the frontier spirit he did
not know that driftwood though possess-
ing all the trappings of the law was still
a frontier town and that it still regarded
possession of a mining claim as good and
sufficient title especially when the same
was backed by a determined occupant with
a cocked rifle in his hands

  then in his mental scurryings he
thought of bird t wippet a man from
his home town bird had been in drift-
wood several months and would know all
about mining law he had some money
too

  bird was contemplating unloading a
trunkful of mining stock on the farmers
in his home state but the ender proposi-
tion would offer greater inducements than
the peddling of specimens of the printers
art once they were in possession of the
property birds money would erect a flume
and install a hydraulic outfit in a few
months driftwood would look up to peter
trimmer with plenty of money to oil the
way he would then launch his political
career first mayor of driftwood that
he might find some excuse for the closing
of mike holsoms place and the placing of
jake ender behind jail bars

  it would not be a personal matter with
him he told himself smugly it would be
for the improvement of the morals of the
community men would say mayor
trimmer is a clean man he could drink
in secret and slip down to some eastern
city when he desired to relax from the
cares of office then circuit judge one
term after that supreme judge of the
state lastly a federal judge a life job
with autocratic powers once a federal
judge he could do as he pleased

  once more he returned to reality with a
jerk he must stop toying with the fu-
ture and stick to the present

ird t wippet was
a pony-sized man with
red curls and a cheru-
bic face but his lead-
colored eyes small and
expressionless i n d i-
cated his ability to look
out for his own inter-
ests he used many startling expressions
and was given to cannon cracker explosions
of mirthless laughter he was extremely
frank with those he considered his in-
 

frontier stories

feriors and smooth and ingratiating with
those he considered his superiors he
measured all men by the money they pos-
sessed

  but trimmer found him seemingly dub-
ious about the ender proposition

  chances are pete you dont know what
youre heading into he said you al-
ways were hammer-headed looking at
you now i see your head does look like a
hammer tie your legs together and a
man could drive nails with your nose
but thats neither here nor there

  mr wippet it was plain considered
tricky his inferior the jackleg beyond
a sickly grin betrayed no resentment he
knew if he secured the cooperation of the
little trickster he would have to swallow
his insults later on he promised him-
self he would trim birds claws

  you come to me wippet went on
with a deal and nothing in your head to
put it over suppose i take hold whats
your idea about the split 

  we would share equally tricky re-
plied solemnly i furnish the legal ad-
vice  you furnish the money

  legal advice mr whippet released
his cannon cracker laugh i furnish the
money-and brains you furnish legal ad-
vice  thats certainly rich-rich as an old
maids dream

  mr wrippets features had suffered no
displacement his lead-colored eyes held no
gleam of mirth his laugh was purely
mechanical he could touch it off at will

  how do you think youd go about get-
ting hold of the property he demanded
contemptuously go out and shake a
feather at ender i suppose say his
claims are jumpable what do you think
you can do about it

  i dont know admitted tricky tamely
thats why i come to you whats the
legal procedure

  wrell my poor half-witted friend
mr wippet condescended to explain you
first find out if ender has done his assess-
ment work if he has not you slap loca-
tion notices over his old ones and record
the claims and- here he paused impress-
ively-leave word with the undertaker
tricky shuddered inwardly

  but theres the law he managed to
point out  we would be within our rights
the law would protect us

  dont get no leaping idea about the
law protecting you chided mr wippet
ive been in this country a lot longer than
you pete and i see you got a barrel of
want n von to a pinch of know-how -

will be no light sashay to grab them claims
such men as that jake ender are as hard
as a keg of nails in an ice house they
think nothing of trimming out a mans
liver and feeding it to a setter dog

  but we would have the sheriff back of
us persisted tricky obsessed with the
might and majesty of the law if end-
ers offered any resistance after we had
taken over the claims the officers would
shoot him down like a dog he recalled
the shirt-snatching an incident he had
neglected to mention to mr wippet and
ground his teeth and twould serve him
just right

  mr wippet scratched his nose deli-
cately

  you see pete you got no brains he
explained i always knowed you had no
brains you got a place to put them and
look human and all that but theres noth-
ing there he tapped his forehead sig-
nificantly nothing there no more than
in a chickens you dont seem to realize
that this jake ender would give both of
us a pair of angel wings as quick as a cat
could lick its left paw heaven is paved
with gold but you cant ship it get my
idea pete of course you dont but try
to think how youd look down on the cold
cold ground with four or five hunks of
chilled lead in your warm quivering pur-
ple personal in-test-tines

  tricky trimmer blenched at the little
promoters ghastly realism and patted his
stomach tenderly

  that got you didnt it wippet
roared he had a tremendous bark for so
small a dog but while ive been sitting
here ive been using my brain ill have
my boys give me a quit-claim deed to the
ender claims i know a justice of the
peace wholl date it up to january second
the time all good claim-jumping is done in
this country my boys are good rough
men whod knock their grandmothers on
the head for a hundred dollars i brought
them in with me and know how far theyll

s-	

  theyll do the posting of the notices
and the notices will carry their names v
after ive recorded the claims and the
deed ill sweeten them up so they can skip
the country well then stand as straight
purchasers of the property and no man
can find any fault with that well be in
good shape to call on the sheriff to oust
ender and to protect us you spoke of
ender showing a big nugget and bragging
how rich the ground was what didhe
hink it would show under hydraulic
king of the thundering bar



aid he was sure there
was between one and
two tons of gold in it
but that he was satis-
fied with what he could
shovel out in a few
hours work a day
tricky was now jubi-
lant bird had found a way to secure the
property without any risk it was a per-
fect plan he attempted a bland smile
but it only evoked insulting comment from
his fellow conspirator

  never try to smile pete mr wippet
advised you look bad enough as it is
but when you try to smile anybody can
see how crooked you be

  but lets get down to business the
quit-daim deed from my men will convey
a four-fifth interest in the claims to me
and one-fifth to you im putting up the
money for the initial expense and twenty
per cent is five times what youre entitled
to youve furnished nothing but a va-
cant stare

  the legal advice squealed tricky
dry-washing his hands furiously the
legal advice

  legal advice hell barked wippet
contemptuously you dont suppose im
going to gamble my good clean money and
let you lie back on your shoulder blades on
a bed of roses and draw half the profits
pete you may have met me several times
but you only recognize my body when
you see it twenty per cent and no more
is what you get

  ender may have just been blowing
but im gambling that the ground is rich
if theres say a ton of gold in the bar
that means around four hundred thousand
dollars with eighty to you you cant
pronounce eighty thousand dollars let alone
think about it and another little point
every chance i take with my in-test-tines
you puts yours up equal get that through
what you use to keep your hat off your
shoulders my boys will do the rough
work but it may be necessary for us to
join in for a spell you wont hang back
and hide under the sidewalk with your
legal advice youll expose your liver to
the same chances as beat down on mine
whats the first move tricky asked
faintly

  to get the lay of the land well take

a trip out to the ender place-

  trickys hands flopped like dying fish
i couldnt do that he objected weakly
ender and i had some words today i
dont -dont care to meet him

  mr wippet leaned back in his chair
and closed one eye

  ah i see he murmured sweetly
then he straightened up and planned
briskly he dont need to see you nor
me neither well take the boys along
and they can spot his discovery notices
if they run against ender they can say
theyre on a deer hunt we can get some-
where and look over the land from a dis-
tance the boys can circle around and
come back to us well make a map of the
ground and then back to town

  i may say now that at first i didnt
think much of the proposition but after
i got my head to work it all straightened
out as clear as a rich widows future but
dont forget in this deal i take the lead
and you follow on january first well
drive out to enders place and see whether
or no hes done his assessment work

  if not on january second around ten
minutes after midnight my boys will put
up location notices come back to town
with us and record the daims and then
with my good money rattling in their pants
skip the country well set back with the
quit-daim deed to the property all prop-
erly signed sealed and recorded

  by and by well notify ender to va-
cate if he shows fight well call on the
law simple as grease on a flys foot
providing you keep your blab shut and
dont try to think if it ever got out our
middle names would be mud

  if one cheep gets to ender youll hear
the report of a rifle right following said
report or maybe said reports youll fall
in seven different directions on examin-
ation of the body as hereinbefore men-
tioned theyll find four or five hunks of
chilled lead in the warm quivering pur-
ple personal ir-test-tines set thsat to
music pete so you wont forget it do
you gather the magnitude of my remarks

  yes gulped tricky

  human murmured mr wippet as
human as if he had good sense

  ill

ake had enjoyed every
red moment of his jam-
boree but contempla-
tion of his return to his
own comfortable cabin
brought him greater
happiness

  he was on the home
trail now with his wagon piled high with
supplies his big horses nig and joe


frontier stories

  walked briskly they knew a warm stable
and good oat hay awaited them at the end
of the road clipper jakes roan saddle
horse trailed behind he too had horse-
thoughts of the warm stable and the good
oat hav and the kindly being who gave
him a handful of sugar now and then

   the prospector after the fashion of men
who lived much alone talked to his horses

   were all set for winter boys he told
them happily and we got money left
thought id spent it all but come to find
out mike had held out half of it said he
thought id gone far enough gave me my
money and sent me home yes siree
boys mike sent me home man thats
your banker you cant fool with him got
to obey orders

   you fellers wont have no troubles this
winter nothin to do but eat your fool
heads off maybe get down a little wood
but thats all clipper back there will be
with you and with nothin to do but take
me over to silver crick now and then or
pack in a deer lucky horses you three

   and im a lucky man as sure as i set
here on this seat cellar will be packed
and jammed with grub two or three deer
hangin up plenty of readin matter
wood piled up high now and then some
pard comes in-dave strong or somebody
no woman to bother or tell me wrhat to
do conscience clear as a bell devil-
ment worked out of me with two weeks o
coltin round in old drift calm as you
please now

  finest cabin in this country snug
warm and handy richest diggins-plenty
for the rest of my life fifty years 
and not an ache nor a pain big as a mule
and as healthy record clear never beat
a man out of a dollar what i got i made
with my own hands king of the thund-
erin bar and wouldnt trade places with
no other king not if hed throw in four
queens to boot

  the shirt-snatching incident had made
no dent in jakes memory thirty years
on the frontier with countless adventures
and jamborees back of him made such in-
cidents unworthy of mind-room in his
twenties and thirties he had wandered from
camp to camp a gamboling giant rough
as a playful grizzly indifferent to hard-
ship careless of the future he had fought
more men and loved more women than he
could remember and there were no gray
hairs in his brown thatch or the long mus-
tache that swept his bronzed jaw his
teeth were as sound as any youths and
he had never known a day of sickness

back of him was a long line of fighting
men and pioneers

  his jamborees had in no way depleted
his vitality storing up energy in the open
with wholesome food and rough work a
two weeks jamboree had no more effect
on him than spending five hundred dollars
wrould have on the financial resources of
a multi-millionaire

   nights gettin frosty now he went on
but ill have a month or so of shovelin
into the sluice it will be right pleasant
boys after all that racket in town sweet
music to hear the swish of the gravel in
the sluice throw her in and let the water
do the rest i like the smell of fresh water
old horses and the pines have a sniff that
cheers me we know the thunderin bar
we do every inch of it rich as mud and
all our own a few shovelfuls a smoke
and if the head is workin right a song
cabin never locked anybody welcome a
big easy life im sayin boys well now
you scamps giddap i want a good meal
from my own stove i want to set at my
own fireplace and lay down in my own bed
nothin like home sweet home

  nig and joe tossed their heads and
quickened their pace clipper feeling a
sudden urge of coltishness ran ahead and
kicked up his heels

  by cripes laughed jake clippers
showin off look at the son-of-a-gun
 ou d think he was a two-year-old instead
of ten cornin next spring

  the man looked around him benignly
this was his country and he loved every
open park every canyon every hill

 the sumach flamed amid aspen gold
a ellow-hammers dipped across the inter-
vales the red squirrel gathering his win-
ter provender scolded impudently as the
wagon rumbled through the pines deer
sped up the sunlight-dappled aisles and
pheasants whirred across the road over
all the haze of indian summer

  and it was given to jake ender to ap-
preciate all the beauty spread before him
for with all his rough exterior his was the
nature of a dreamer

  shes a world of glory he murmured
contentedly im certainly glad im alive
this day

  the nighthawks were booming when
nig and joe turned into the canyon of the
thundering bar clipper the impatient
galloped on ahead head high tail proudly
elevated

   of their own accord the team halted in
the clear cold water of thundering creek
and with much bit-champing drank their
king of the thundering bar

fill then eagerly they forded the stream
and pressed on up the canyon

  jake was not surprised when he saw that
his cabin windows were gleaming like
squares of gold in the purple dusk he
never locked his cabin no doubt dave
strong or some other friend was awaiting
his coming he hoped it was old dave
theyd have a good long visit dave was
a wise old he-coon and an easy man to
have around he knew how to make a
venison pie that would make a man fight
a silvertip barehanded always had a lot
of good stories to tell and was well-in-
formed read everything and never for-
got what he read a loyal friend and hon-
est as the day was long always showed
up about every so often

  but no dave came forth to give him
hearty greeting with a feeling of disap-
pointment not untouched by loneliness he
drove into the yard between his cabin and
the big cellar and swung down from the
seat then hope blossomed in his heart
maybe dave had heard him coming and
was hurrying to get supper for him

  in his buffalo overcoat he looked like a
big grizzly as he strode across the yard

  dave you old scoundrel he bellowed
as he flung open the door how the-

-tt-bruptly he halted

                 mouth agape eyes wide
with surprise and won-
	jlpl derment near his big

 dpwh	cookstove stood three

fjprm	an a

wssffl irlsili k-v ragged forlorn
and a little fearful
before them like a captain in front of his
company stood a boy about twelves years
of age suffering and responsibility had
aged him but on his thin face was the
stamp of nobility his clear gray eyes held
no shadow of fear

  we used some of your flour sir he
explained before jake could speak and
some syrup but that was all ill work to
pay for it

  frankness and honesty rang in his young
voice he was a child with the heart and
soul of a fearless honest man

  jakes great heart melted these were
children ragged dirty forlorn and for-
saken this thin-faced boy had suffered
much and it was plain that he considered
himself responsible for the welfare of the
other children a young brave

  the prospector jerked off his mittens
strode across the cabin and took the boys
thin hand in his great warm palm

  lord bless you son youre welcome to
anything in jake enders cabin whats
your name boy

  diamond neemer answered the
youngster di for short

  jake dropped on his knees before the
little company and spread out his arms
the baby boy came to him fearlessly the
little girls shyly his great arms dosed
about them all

  whats your names

  ruby answered the eldest girl
  pearl murmured the next

  opal the youngest informed him she
patted the baby boys head his name is
emerald but we call him little raldy
she volunteered eagerly

  a collection of precious jewels
laughed jake but what am i thinkin
of  fie sprang to his feet first thing
a good hot supper we can visit after-
ward now lets see wrell have some
beefsteak and gravy fried taters and on-
ions bread and butter gingersnaps and
sweet crackers and canned peaches how
does that hit you

  they smiled but made no- comment
they were quiet children

  i guess that will do grinned jake
now girls you can set the table and you
get the fire boomin di better put raldy
where he can take a nap poor youngun
looks wore out it wont be long

  never before had jake shown so much
speed in preparing a meal soon appetiz-
ing odors filled the cabin little raldys
lips moved and a little dribble ran out of
the corner of his mouth jake gave him
a piece of beefsteak to take the edge off his
hunger a strange happiness thrilled the
big prospector the cabin had never
seemed more cheerful when the smok-
ing meal was on the table he called the
children to him

  what say everybody give us a kiss be-
fore we eat it will help make the grub
taste better he dropped to his knees

  raldy seemed to know what was ex-
pected for he put his arms around jakes
neck grunted and gave him a hug followed
by a wet smack the little girls kissed him
shyly di reserved and regarding kiss-
ing as somewhat effeminate took the mans
hand and patted it he was so full of
gratitude he could not speak

  they were soon seated at the table
raldy was at jakes left with a spoon to
shovel meat potatoes and gravy into a face
that was soon to be daubed to the ears

  it was plain to the man that the chil-
dren were half-starved they ate like
frontier stories

famished wolf cubs pausing for breath
they looked at him adoringly to them
he meant food shelter protection and love
to them he was a god

  jake thought of his team standing in
the cold

  go right on and eat kids he told them
help yourselves di open up more
peaches if you want em plenty more on
the wagon eat all you want of every-
thing ill be back as soon as i put up the
horses

  ill go with you mister ender the
boy volunteered in his manly way i
put our horse and cow in your barn and i
guess theyll be in your way i gave them
some of your hay too they were hungry
and-

  now young feller growled jake
with mock fierceness i dont want to hear
nothin about that anything on the
thunderin bar is yours as for that
mister ender that dont sound good
what say you call me daddy jake for a
spell yes sir and no sir sounds
fine and shows youre well raised but if
were goin to love one another we cant
have no mister around this camp what
is it di mister ender or daddy jake

  daddy jake murmured the boy softly

  all right son and just you set there
and eat little raldys about ready to fall
over when hes through eatin put him
on one of the beds back of the curtain

  he lighted a lantern and rushed out

  you got some visitors tonight-that
wore-out horse and that old muley cow
he confided to nig and joe while he was
stuffing the manger with fragrant oat hay
dont think the cow disgraces you boys
for she fed five of the finest kids that ever
lived the youngsters are all up to my
cabin stuffed full of grub and snug and
warm theyll sleep under blankets and
buffalo robes tonight ill soon have them
fat and sassy nothin goes hungry round
jakes place as you two lazy old fat scoun-
drels know those youngsters will come
out in the spring as slick as cub hears

  oh yes im goin to keep them dont
know who they belong to or what and
dont care i look at the bedrock facts
boys and pay no attention to the trimmins
the thunderin bar will take care of a
dozen sets of kids and why shouldnt i
keep them anybody who will bring five
children into the world when theyve noth-
in to give them hasnt got a claim on them
to beat jake enders jake will feed and
clothe em love em and protect em and
thats the claim that counts you fellers

will get a square deal as usual but youll
have to take a back seat you and clipper
a family man cant give too much pettin

to horses

  iv

ittle raldy and
his three sisters were
asleep in one of jakes
big beds back of the
rather gorgeous curtain
that divided the twenty-
hy-forty room jake
had hauled the other
bed into the kitchen now in his favorite
homemade rocker his pipe drawing freely
he bade di tell the story of his wanderings
and how he came to thundering bar

  i know youre wore out son but tell
me all about it so after you turn in i can
set here and figger a little  what im
goin to do for you

  it was this way began the boy in his
calm voice father was sick so much
that mother said he wasnt any good she
said she was tired of wandering around in
an old covered wagon and having children
one day she went away we waited for
her but she did not come back father
then said he would have to he both father
and mother to us and that i would have to
help him

  he drove and drove father did he
wanted to find a home for us a farm with
trees and running water on it he was a
school teacher and he taught us things as
we looked for the farm but it was so
hard for him to work i guess he didnt
know how sometimes hed get lost and
didnt know where he was once the
wagon wheel broke and he didnt know how
to fix it i remembered seeing a black-
smith fix a wagon wheel and so i told
father but he couldnt fix it good he
had needles and thread but he couldnt
sew good

  mother couldnt sew either she hated
sewing and cooking once a woman in a
wagon we met sewed for us and she could
sew and cook good but she had children
and couldnt look after us

  father said to me di your mother
was not to blame for leaving us i am to
blame for it all i have no right to chil-
dren as i have no ability to work for
them thats just what my father said
i remember every word he said and what
they meant he was a school teacher and
taught us words but it was hard for him
to get us something to eat and wear all
the time i thought when i get big enough
king of the thundering bar

ill get the girls and little raldy all they
want to eat and father too

  we all slept in the wagon to keep
warm as we didnt have many covers one
morning i got up to build a fire and to get
some water the girls got up and took
care of raldv but father didnt get up
we waited for him to get up because he
was sick i got breakfast-pancakes and
grease-and then climbed into the wagon
and touched father he didnt say any-
thing and i took hold of his arm i dont
know how i knew about it but pretty soon
i knew he was dead i wondered what i
would do you see daddy jake it wasnt
so much that my father was dead as it was
that there was so little to eat for the girls
and little raldy and i had to look after
them

  i thought i wouldnt say anything to
pearl and opal about father being dead
but i told ruby she cried but i told her
to hush as we had to look after pearl and
opal and little raldy so we covered
father up in the wagon and took the good
horse and the cow and what grub we had
and started out you see one of the
horses was crippled up and father didnt
knowt what to do for him so we left him
i put the girls and little raldy on the
horse with the grub and something to cook
with and started out toward the moun-
tains

  at night we camped we got pretty
cold as id left the covers for father i
would sleep a little and wake up and put
wood on the fire we didnt see anything
but wild cattle on the prairies and some
deer when we got in the mountains i
wished for a gun so i could kill some cat-
tle or deer and give the girls and little
raldy some meat to eat

  when we got in the mountains we only
had a little flour left and a piece of salt
pork the cow didnt give much milk and
little raldy needed it i didnt know what
to do when i made pancakes out of the last
of the flour and fried the last of the pork
and gave it to the girls

  how about yourself son asked jake
softly his hand on the boys thin shoulder
werent you eatin any of the flapjacks
and pork

  di looked at him as if wondering how a
man could ask such a foolish question

  why i was taking my fathers place
dont you see if youre a man you cant
eat when your sisters and little brother
need it dont you see how it was daddy
jake

  i sure do smiled jake affectionately



i sure see how it was young pard you
did the right thing and youre a man im
proud of you di then what did you
do

ell we saw the road
and followed it up to
this cabin i didnt
want to touch anything
as father had always
told us not to touch
anything that did not
belong to us he taught
us things father did told us we must
say no sir and yes sir tell the truth
and never touch anything that did not be-
long to us and he said you must al-
ways love one another

  but the girls were so hungry that i
thought it would be all right if i made
some pancakes out of your flour we ate
the pancakes and slept a little and then
you came

  and how would you like to stay with
me di you and your sisters and little
raldy plenty to eat and good clothes
and helpin daddy jake shovel into the
sluice no more trouble no more goin
hungry no more wanderin around what
say you son

  the boy sighed his relief it was plain
that he was used to repressing his emo-
tions he leaned against jake evidently
experiencing great difficulty in finding
words to express his gratitude

  ill work for you when i grow up and
pay for my grub and my sisters and little
raldys he said finally

  jake shook his head and drew the boy
down on his knee

  thats not it di he rumbled what
jake wants to know is whether you and
your sisters and little raldy can learn to
love him and be his children

  all the repressed emotion in the boys
heart now broke he had been under a
terrible strain here was a big warm-
hearted man who fairly radiated security
after all twelves years is no advanced age
his head drooped against jakes broad
chest he did not cry but the man could
feel him shiver

  never you fret son soothed the pros-
pector rocking a little jake will fight
for you to the last ditch everything in
the cabin is yours wrant a gun there is
a dozen to pick from want a pony
theres clipper to ride or ill get you an-
other wrant books jake will get em for
you all you have to do in return for all
that is just to love me and come christ-
frontier stoprr

mas night son well have one of the big-
gest trees in this country with a dance and
plenty to eat and all the kids in the coun-
try here for a big frolic

   dis masculine stoicism broke he put
his arms around jakes neck and actually
kissed him blindly and awkwardly

  jake gave him a mighty hug rose and
swung him up in the air and dropped him
on the bed

  di laughed now he could see a lot of
fun ahead with daddy jake it was pleas-
ant to be tossed in the air even if he was
tired and sleepy

   get undressed young feller growled
the man with mock fierceness or ill give
you a cuff on the ear get under them
covers never mind if its cold and windy
outside everybodys snug and warm in
this cabin and theres plenty of grub
well have a big breakfast bacon and eggs
and hot biscuits get to sleep now

  when the boy was asleep jake rested
his huge feet on the stove hearth and pon-
dered the future

  he could take the children to drift-
wood and turn them over to the authorities
but he wasnt going to do that not by a
long shot a hell of a note to turn over
a game young rooster like di to the county
like he was a stray colt or some such thing

  might get a woman to come and care
for them no he wouldnt do that wo-
man or two over to silver creek who
would fix up clothes for them and do
their washing but hed have no woman
raising them didnt need no woman to
raise his children there was di to con-
sider a woman made a boy soft he
would raise di like a man boy was game
and honest and would grow up to be as
fine a rnan as ever lived wouldnt have
no woman around filling di full of her
notions and fears di was a man and would
get a mans deal as for the little girls he
might send them now and then to some
woman in driftwood to go to school but
he would have them during the summers
but hed have no woman around the cabin
the girls could look after raldy and
theyd all get along in good shape hed
adopt them legally as quick as he could
get to it

  he was glad now that he was a handy
man there was not a shade of effeminacy
in his nature but he could cook and sew
better than the average woman he could
use a broad ax or a needle with equal skill

 here were cupboards and shelves in his
cabin and places for everything he posses-
sed his guns were always clean andw

oiled ins books and papers where they be-
longed his lamps filled and their chim-
neys spotless

  the children would acquire no slapdash
habits from him they would learn sys-
tem and order he would build an addi-
tion on the cabin and every youngster
would have a place for his or her belong-
ings and keep them there he would have
three good meals a day and each child
would have so much work to do eve-
nings they would read or study he would
get them books and a blackboard next
winter he would send them to school at
silver creek they would have a team of
ponies and a buckboard and their dinner
pails would be full of good grub no man
or woman could say that jake ender didnt
look out for his children

v

rr- m bjake and di shoveled
             the rich dirt into the
             murmuring sluice-the
             murmuring sluice that
             the imitative little

                   mimi the little girls
i	built playhouses of

sticks and stone or made doll dresses
their soft voices blended sweetly with the
voice of the hurrying water

  many songs came to jake as he shoveled
into the sluice but they were not jam-
boree chanties they were songs with such
refrains as

  i got strong arms j got rich dirt
  to feed the gulpin waters

   i got a cellar full of grub

two sons and three fine daughters

  never before had he had a more appre-
ciative audience never before had he sung
so happily the children had not only
brought him love but luck in the shape of
many thumping nuggets in the clean-up
the king of the thundering bar would
not have traded places with any man on
earth

  he had taken his family to the town at
the terminus of the railroad since the
stores there carried bigger stocks than
driftwoods with a greater variety from
which to select winter outfits for the girls
each youngster had been outfitted from
head to foot he had bought another horse
and another wagon for one wagon would
not hold his purchases it was his plan to
build an addition on the cabin as soon as
he could get time to ride over to dave
king of the thundering bar



strongs camp and ask his old friend to
help him raise the logs he had bought
furniture for the girls room and warm
blankets and quilts then there had been
a great assortment of christmas presents
not only for his own brood but for every
child he knew in the district

  and finally through an accommodating
judge adoption proceedings had been
started

  jake had no trouble with his fosterlings
they were quiet obedient children with
good wholesome food they soon blossomed
into red-cheecked lusty happy youngsters
their love for their foster father was ador-
ation itself calm thoughtful gray-eyed
di would have given his life for the big
prospector as quickly as he would have
ijiven him a smile

  when jake showed him the discovery
lotices of the eight claims that formed the
leart of the thundering bar he resolved
f ever daddy jake needed his help to
lght to the last gasp to defend those sym-
ols of possession

  these claims di are as much yours as
nine now jake told him youre my
on and pard and if you ever see a man
oolin with our notices you take down one
f my rifles and cut loose at him bounce
-ome lead near him di and if he dont
 nove bounce some more a little nearer
this is your ground and dont you forget
t always be ready di to fight for what
s rightfully yours be square with every-
ody give when you can but for what is
ightfully yours fight to the last ditch

  the children never tired of the clean-
up when they saw the dull gleam of the
rold they always laughed now and then
fake put some quicksilver in the sluice
ft was always a wonder to the children to
ee him put the pan on the stove to cook
he gold they watched until the gold
ippeared it seemed like magic to them

  rich days in the morning the frag-
rance of frying hacon and boiling coffee
drifting through the half-open cabin door
little raldy in his high chair by the stove
the girls setting the table di bringing in
wood jake the ever-benign fresh-shaven
and clear-eyed preparing breakfast
i after the clean-up supper perhaps a
chunk of venison that had been roasting
for hours in a dutch oven with some
bacon onions and potatoes to enrich it
jake had bought another cow and there
vas plenty of rich sweet milk for the
children he took one day a week for
taking he baked rich cookies and packed

them into big jars he thought nothing of
making a dozen apple pies jakes arith-
metic had been sadly neglected he never
could learn to divide a pie into more than
three pieces

  when he gave one of his youngsters a
piece of apple pie it was a wedge nearly
as big as his hand he sprinkled it liber-
ally with sugar poured pure rich cream
over it and handed it to the child

  get outside of that theres plenty
more where it come from would be his
admonition

  after supper he always romped with the
youngsters or devised some game to play
after the romp he read to them or had
them read their lessons to him

n the end wall of the
bedroom was a big fire-
place jake would draw
the curtain back and
put a back log in the
fireplace soon the big
room would be warm
and cheerful on the
table a pan of apples and nuts little
raldy poddy w-ith bread and milk his
head against jakes chest staring content-
edly at the leaping flames di sprawrled
out on the bearskin before the fireplace
but always in a position that enabled him
to see his foster father he never tired
of looking at that big bronzed face

  bedtime one by one the little girls
would come to the man whom they adored
and kiss him goodnight but di always
liked to stay up a little while when the
other children were asleep he liked to sit
at the side of his foster father and look
at the fire

  i just like to be with him he would
have said had he expressed his feelings

  the five were soon convinced that there
was nothing in the world that their foster
father feared and no obstacle he could not
overcome they never disobeyed him for
it was too great a privilege to be asked to
do something for him his frown was a
calamity too great even to be considered
even little raidy wanted to do something
for daddy jake he brought in wood
grunting loudly jake made him a little
wooden shovel and he toiled manfully
throwing a spoonful into the sluice now
and then

  misfortune and hardship had disciplined
them the memories of their parents were
dim but they did not forget that once they
had been hungry ragged forlorn and for-
ioo

saken when they thought of their days
of poverty their love for their foster
father became more intense he was their
protector never again would they have
to eat pancakes and grease three times a
day never again would they be dirty and
ragged daddy jake would take care of
them

 vi

idafternoon of
new years day a
foot of snow had cov-
ered all the scars that
jakes pick and shovel
had made in the heart
of the thundering bar
and reduced the string
of sluice boxes to a thin dark line the
boxed discovery notice looked like a dark
goblet laden with white flowers

  near the back door of the cabin stood
clipper pawing at the hard ground on
his back was a roomy saddle on his shapely
head a hackamore jake discarded bits
during the cold weather he wanted his
horses to be comfortable nig and joe
were so well-trained that they seldom
needed reining a word would turn them
or halt them

  i wouldnt want a chunk of iron in my
mouth to have to keep warmed up jake
explained to di so when it turns off
cold no horse of mine is bothered with a
bit treat your horses right di and
theyll serve you well

  from the back door of the cabin to the
comer projected a shed room beneath
this shelter was piled stove wood in orderly
cords

  dead trees that have seasoned in the
air jack told di make the best fire-
wood cut em into splittin lengths
when you hit a chunk of that kind of
wood it will go twong that means it is
sound stuff

  between the shed and the cellar or root
house ran a shoulder-high line of sound
chunks for the fireplace back of the line
of chunks w-as a great pile of seasoned
logs ready for the saw and ax

  come what will jake told the children
were goin to keep warm and snug this
winter we dont have to pinch down on
wood

  for that matter they did not have to
pinch down on anything the cellar
was piled to the ceiling with provisions
from a nearby pine hung the carcasses of
two deer on a stout shelf between the

big cupboard and the cook stove a company
of squat bottlesstood at parade rest in
them was placer gold-about fifty ounces
of the precious metal jake had struck
one pocket out of which he had taken over
thirty ounces in three days

  younguns luck he called it

  the children were getting their foster
father ready for a ride to dave strongs
place dave would return with him and
help build the girls room di brought his
buffalo overcoat cap and mittens the
girls brought him his heaviest boots his
overshoes and an extra pair of thick
woolen socks they would not permit him
to touch those articles they worked like
little trojans pulling and tugging at the
socks and boots grunting in their strugglei
with the overshoes to be of service to
him was a great privilege when he re-
turned they would pull off his overshoes
and boots and scamper for his slippers di
would take his overcoat cap and mittens
and put them away

  now came raldy with an old pipe
jakes favorite pipe was in his pocket but
he thanked the little fellow elaborately and
put the old discarded pipe into his
pocket

  i swear he laughed i never would
get started if i didnt have such good
helpers how i ever got along without
you kids i dunno

  now di everythings in shape you
can fry some venison and taters for sup-
per and make some taffy if you want be
sure and turn off the molasses barrel spout
ou know how to get breakfast and that
beef pie i made yesterday will do for din-
ner tomorrow warm it up in the oven
look out for fire and be careful with the
lamps i figger on gettin back tomorrow
night with old dave with me im de-
pendin on you and ruby di to look after
things anybody calls invite them in anc
give them something to eat

  any of mv friends tell them to help
themselves strangers do the best you
can for them tell them ill be back in a
little while but he added with a laugh
if you see anybody tryin to carry off the
thunderin bar just take down my big-
gest rifle raise the window shove it
through and cut close enough to him to
see how high he can jump if he dont
jump cut a little closer

  he put on his shaggy overcoat and
dropped to his knees each little girl
gave him a hug and a kiss raldy kissed
him and then drew back and stared at him
fondly di pounded his back the boy way

king of the thundering bar

ior

 of showing love they followed him out
 to clipper and waved as long as they could
 see him

   when jake was out of sight of the
 thundering bar he thought of singing
 the song he had sung with such spirit in
 mikes place came to him once more

 theres just three reasons why i think-
 why a jigger wants a drink

   because hes dry

   a pard is nigh

 or-any other reason why

   but he found himself unable to sing the
 refrain somehow the words brought him
 no happiness nor did he care for the vi-
 sion they prompted in fact the vision of
 the swimming-eyed men at the bar was
 very dim it seemed to merge into a vi-
 sion of children those faces near his
 own were not the flushed faces of pardners
 they were the faces of the children-his
 j children

   that life he told clipper happily is
 all behind me i had my fill old horse
 i raised hell for thirty years or more and
 have no regrets but ive got something
 better now move up clip we cant
 fool along when weve five younguns wait-
 in for us to get back

now certain small fears intruded may-
be he should have taken the children over
to silver creek and left them with the
t woman who did their sewing and washing
r for them di was as reliable as any man
i but then something might happen this
was the first night he had been away from
 them since they came to him fully now
he realized how tightly their little hands
had gripped his heart

   they have grown into me he mur-
 mured become a part of me cripes
 what a man has to pay for love when it
 comes always does it bring the dread of
 loss

   he was half-minded to return to them
 still that was a foolish thought they
 had plenty of wood plenty of grub and
 were wise little rascals di was reliable
 and dependable with a mans mind under
 his shock of glinting hair ruby was a
 little mother to her sisters and raldy and
 there was no human being in the country
 who would harm a child they were snug
 and safe enough

   but when he reached bill oaks cabin
 he was happily surprised dave was there
 with his heavy rifle and a bundle of

vii

he morning of the sec-
ond of january di was
up early a man could
not lie abed when there
was work to do noise-
lessly he moved about
the cabin lest he awaken
the girls and little
raldy snug and warm in the big bed back
of the curtain a man always let children
sleep in the morning with meticulous
care he observed his foster fathers admon-
itions concerning matches lamps and fire

  repressing the desire to give voice to
the shivers the cold water roused he
washed his face and hands and combed his
tangled locks then he drew on his over-
shoes and donned a high-collared sheep-
skin-lined jacket that jake had given him
a fur cap and thick mittens completed his
comfortable garb milk bucket on arm
he extinguished the lamp and picked up
the lantern he stole out on tiptoe and
closed the door softly

  at the barn in imitation of jake he as-
sured the horses and cows that it was a
fine large morning he fed them liber-
ally and milked the cow jake had bought

  hurrying back to the cabin he strained
the milk into crocks and set them in the
lower part of the cupboard he was un-
aware that two men lurking back of the
barn had heard him talking to the horses
the plans of mr bird wippet were un-
known to him the great question before
him now was what to have for breakfast
he decided that corn meal mush would be
welcomed by all concerned

  soon the stove was glowing and the tea
kettle singing now the girls and little
raldy were stirring in their warm nest
di as he prepared the mush smiled at
raldys impatient grunts the little rascal
always grunted that way when the girls
were dressing him presently he charged
full-tilt into the kitchen followed by his
three little mothers di filled the wash
basin with hot water girls and babies had
to have warm water to wash in they
couldnt stand cold water men dont
bother about such things but girls and
babies had to be cared for

  ruby set the table while pearl scrubbed
raldys face and hands and combed the
tangles out of his linty hair

  di dished out the mush and warmed
raldys milk the children poured pure
rich cream over their mush little won-
der they were plump and red-cheeked


frontier stories

  in the barn hairlip pike and scratchy
brown two of mr wippets imported
hirelings considered the posting of the
last location notice that would give their
employer title to the eight placer claims
that formed the thundering bar

  they had expected to jump tlie claims
by moonlight but a cloudy sky and a light
fall of snow had brought such intense
darkness that they had refused to risk life
and limb in carrying out the plans of the
clever little promoter

  wippet didnt say anything about a
boy said pike ender must be away
or the boy wouldnt be doin the work

  i dont know so much about that
growled scratchy he may have the kid
for to do the work while he snoozes
scratchy measured the characters of other
men by his own had he had a boy he
would have kicked him out in the morn-
ing made a slave of him

  guess wed better go up to the cabin
and see whats what suggested pike if
enders is asleep or just gettin up we
can say were lost that last claim wont
make much difference wippet has the
whole she-bang quit-claimed over to him
and location notices all ready to be re-
corded by a friend of hisn first thing this
mornin besides he aint done so well by
us two hundred dollars apiece for this
job aint no money im not goin to take
no chances on bein plugged for two hun-
dred dollars well ask for directions and
move on

  what if he asks us to stay for break-
fast

  well take a swig or two of coffee
replied pike and let on were in a hurry
i can tell you if hes there im goin to
be movin but if the kid is alone we can
take our own time id pass up the whole
layout right now but for the other hun-
dred and expense money we got cornin
from wippet hell be watchin up there
on the rim of the canyon and he wont
pay us off if we dont jump the claim the
sluice is on hes got an idee that its the
richest of the whole group recollect he
said he wanted that special

  well go ahead grumbled scratchy
but i dont aim to do no dyin for wippet
i don t know why i went into this deal for
peanut money and expenses to get out of
the country but here i be and i spose i
might as well go through with it

  di the fearless receied the two bullies
with calm politeness but the little girls
and raldy shrank back from them in-
tuition told them that their two visitors

were not to be trusted ruby shooed
raldy into the bedroom pearl and opal

slowly sidled after her

  shall i make you some coffee di
asked

  sure thing grunted pike and some
o that mush and milk would help out

is little green eyes sud-
denly widened he
nudged scratchy and
covertly jerked a
stubby thumb at the
squat bottles on the
stout shelf

  purty gold you got
there he remarked to di with assumed
casualness

  di filled the coffee pot with water be-
fore he answered

  thats what daddy jake got out of the
thundering bar he explained he could
get out lots more than that but we dont 
need it

  youre purty young to be running this i
place alone aint you

  i guess so but it wont be long daddy
take will be back tonight you can eat
your mush now theres plenty of cream
in the pitcher there

  they drew up to the table and gobbled
down what was left of the mush pike
tilted the big pitcher and drank deeply of
the cream

  good stuff that he grunted licking
his harelip scratchy took a swig from
the pitcher and licked his scraggly mus-
tache

  di began to feel a vague antagonism to-
ward the two daddy jake did not act
that way daddy jake did not drink from
the pitcher and lick his mustache daddy
jake always said that a visitor should wait
to be invited before he touched anything
he had not invited these men to drink
from the pitcher if daddy jake caught
them drinking from the pitcher he would
tell them to behave themselves if they
didnt behave themselves daddy jake
would make them

  the two drained the coffee pot and
shoved back their chairs

  again pike jerked his stubby thumb at
the gold

  must be around a thousand dollars
worth of the stuff he said ignoring di
wemight as well fill our hands since
were movin out anyway neednt say
anything to wippet about it let him set-
tle his own affairs

  a good idee agreed scratchy enthu-
siastically
while

  but they underestimated the intelligence
of the boy

  you mustnt touch daddy jakes gold
he told them softly but there was a glint
of cold determination in his gray eyes he
backed toward the shelf you cant have
it he added valiantly i wont let you
have it

  pike heaved himself erect grinning
mirthlessly he thrust the boy aside but
di was not the sort to submit tamely si-
lently as a wolf he flung himself at the
bully clawing and pounding scratchy
began dropping the heavy bottles into his
capacious coat pockets pike held di off
with one hand and pocketed his share of
the treasure

  the desperate boy wild with rage at the
abuse of his hospitality snached up a
chunk of wrood from the box near the
stove and hurled it at pike the bully
dodged but the end of the billet scratched
his jaw in a sudden surge of rage he
swung his fist against the boys cheek di
went down as though struck with a sledge
the little girls peering around the curtain
began crying raldy raised a doleful howl

  well stick up the notice grumbled
pike and hit the trail danged young
wildcat i just had to hit him come on
well split even when we get clear of this
place

  they ran from the cabin their pockets
sagging with the weight of the gold and
headed for the boxed location notice

  di was on his feet lurching toward
jakes gun closet when the two thieves
reached the discovery notice the claim-
jumpers had noticed the closet but had
supposed it to be merely another cupboard
the boys head was ringing and he could
scarcely see but he managed to drag the
heaviest repeater to the window with
little whimpers of desperation he raised
the window and rested the rifle on the sill
dropping to his knees he aimed at the
little dark figures near the sluice boxes
and pulled the trigged but no explosion
followed he had forgotten to load with
some difficulty he threw a shell into the
barrel this time the gun bellowed like
a cannon the recoil threw him back but
did not diminish his cold determination
he threw in another shell and pulled the
trigger his shoulder was numb he was
sick and faint his face was bruised and
bloody but he was doing his best to defend
the property of the man who loved and
trusted him



the little figures were now moving down
the canyon he swung the rifle and fired
rapidly he could see his bullets raise
spurts of snow

 enders slipped back panted
scratchy

  but pike only wheezed being solely con
cerned with throwing his feet

  di had no idea of the wild panic in the
hearts of hairlip pike and scratchy
brown nor did he know that bird t
wippet and tricky trimmer watching the
field of operations from the rim of the
canyon were now on their way they
had seen the lantern bobbing to and from
the barn and had supposed the big pros-
pector wras at home they could not un-
derstand why pike and scratchy would
have so little sense as to put up a notice
under the very nose of jake ender

  crazy fools panted wippet as he
wallowed through the snow toward his
team enderll follow us now it means
a killing-it means a killing

  tricky trimmer threw his long shanks
with wild abandonment what a fool he
had been to permit wippet to intimidate
to force him into this terrible situation
ender would kill them all he recalled
birds remark about hunks of chilled
lead in warm quivering purple personal
in-test-tines

  he would fall in the merciless snow
kick a little and then no more would peter
trimmer walk the earth and there were
so many tilings he could do if permitted
to live still there might be a chance
he flung himself forward throwing snow
like a galloping ostrich he was soon far
ahead of the short-legged wippet he
thanked his lucky stars now that he was
thinly dressed he had envied wippet
his wolfskin overcoat and felt boots but
now the little red hogs encumbering garb
was an invitation to a funeral

  shooting shooting shooting the
blasts of the heavy gun evoked from the
pines long lingering reverberations that
made wippet and tricky strain for more
speed

o	intent were they
on throwing their feet
clear of the snow that
they did not see the
three horsemen circling
through the pines sud-
denly there came the
withering crack of a
rifle from the pines at trickys left
snow whiffed up a few feet ahead of him

     king of the thundering bar
itll make the job worth


frontier stories

  that was not right he thought it was
dangerous to shoot so close to a man
again the snow whiffed up in front of him
it dawned on tiim that the sensible thing
to do was to halt mr wippet also fa-
vored the idea of halting he was armed
with a sixshooter but in no mood to lead
a forlorn hope three riders rode out
from the pines jake dave strong and
bill oak dave was responsible for the
spurts of snow that had halted tricky
the three prospectors had witnessed dis
defense of the thundering bar and had
circled to cut off the retreat of the two
schemers

  mf wippet was not without a certain
gameness now that he was caught he
resolved to lay his cards on the table
the claims had been jumped and recorded
he held the high cards enders would
not dare to shoot him down in cold blood
he would bargain with the prospector
he would return him a fifth interest for
the sake of peace

  he would get rid of tricky and give
ender the interest he had promised the
jackleg lawyer tricky did not know that
his name had been omitted from one of
the quit-claim deeds pike and scratchy had
signed mr wippet had made out two
deeds one to show to tricky and one to
be recorded always a thoughtful little
man bird when it come to looking out
for himself

  move along you two snarled jake
youre goin to my cabin well hear
what my boy has to say about this affair
bill you stick with this pair and me and
dave will see what them runners have to
say

  easily the two prospectors followed the
trail of their captives to the team sequest-
ered amid some jackpines there they
waited for the fleeing pike and scratchy

  well let em get close planned jake
as the two claim-jumpers came out of the
canyon and slogged toward them if
they make a false move plug em i figger
they were tryin to jump my claims and di
opened on them with my forty-five seventy
id know the beller of that old gun any-
where

  it was plain to the prospectors that the
two men approaching them were close to
exhaustion they stumbled frequently
and their movements were slow and
clumsy

  dave cocked his rifle jake drew his
six-shooter and pressed the hammer back
the two thieves could not see them and
wippet and tricky guarded by bill oak

were not yet visible from the road pike
was within twenty paces of the wagon ere

he saw the two prospectors

  hands up yelled dave strong pike
thought of reaching for his six-shooter
but promptly changed his mind there
was something in the voice of the man with
the rifle that told of sudden death he
elevated his paws scratchy followed suit

  ill search em for guns jake told
dave you keep the iron on em if
they get funny let em have it

  well well commented the king of the
thundering bar when he found his gold
in the pockets of the two bullies you
boys have been havin a good time while i
was away he relieved them of their wea-
pons you can carry the dust back

  bill oak came up with the panting wip-
pet and the wild-eyed tricky

  what you want done with these two
jake he asked pleasantly seems to me
we better knock em on the head and leave
em lay

  jake stared at tricky where had he
seen that graveyard face before oh yes
this was the jackleg lawyer whose shirt
he had snatched out ages ago

  get m your wagon he ordered the
four head for my cabin make any
breaks and well make a hearse out of it
jake seemed pleasant enough but
tricky sensed a certain deadliness about
the big prospector he was half-frozen
outwardly and now he felt a spiritual chill
mr wippet however was nursing his
bluff when they reached the cabin he
would make his play he would show
ender that he held the high cards and
that brute force would accomplish-well
nothing simply nothing

  jake rode ahead the children came
from the cabin di trembling and shak-
ing from the strain of battle lurched into
his foster fathers arms

  whats the matter with your cheek
son 

  that man hit me and took your gold
quavered the boy pointing at pike oh
daddy jake i tried to stop him but i was
no good i wasnt strong enough i hit
him with a stick of wood and he hit me

tice down there

rifle for this now take the children in the
house and have ruby wash your face and

king of the thundering bar

  he turned to bill oak as the children
scampered away

  ride down to that notice by the sluice
and see if these fellers have jumped my
claims then and dave while bill is
gettin the news well take our friends
down to the barn and have a talk with
them

  relieving pike and scratchy of the gold
he set the squat bottles in the snow

  turn that team you little red-headed
squirt and drive down to my barn he
roared at mr wippet when you get
there get down were goin to have a
heart to heart talk

  bill oak returned with the new location
notices

hey jumped em all
r i g h t lie reported
looks kin da bad
jake with your assess-
ment not done

  mr wippet descend-
ed from the wagon
now was the time to
launch his bluff

  ender you might as well know now
that i hold the high cards he said calmly
enough these two men are within the
law you failed to do your assessment
work and they located the claims they
have given me a quit-claim deed to the
property and the same together with the
location notices is duly recorded before
now but i want to be fair with you let
by-gones be by-gones and ill give you a
fifth interest in the property ill put in
a hydraulic and make you more money
than you ever heard of as for these two
men taking your gold im not responsible
for that you saw i had no part in that
matter

  youre a kind-hearted little man
smiled jake but his eyes were cold ill
think over your proposition but before i
give it much thought i want to talk with
this hair-lipped gorilla here come on
you into the barn with me

  pike was young and far above the aver-
age in strength but a child in the grip of
the mighty jake the prospectors iron
fingers closed about his wrist he at-
tempted some resistance against jakes two
hundred and forty pounds of bone and
muscle but was jerked from his feet as
though he were a straw-stuffed dummy

  pike was a tough bird but what jake
gave him took all the toughness out of him
it was a plain spanking with a pickhandle
he struggled but remorselessly the pick-



handle smacked against his back terrible
blows that soon brought the whimper of
surrender from him but jake was not
satisfied when he had administered the
frightful spanking he placed the bully ex-
actly where he wanted him and drove a
sledge hammer fist against his jaw it was
a perfect knockout he came from the
barn dragging the plug-ugly as he would
a dead hog

  well load this meat he told his
friends after i finish up the rest i gave
him a little extra on account of him hit-
tin my boy

  mr wrippet was tempted to run but the
cold gaze of dave strong was upon him
and he was afraid even to bat an eye
tricky was almost ready to swoon
scratchys frazzly mustache uras twitch-
ing he glanced about him wildly but
could see no avenue of escape better to
endure a pickhandle whacking than be shot
down

  jake jerked scratchy off his feet seized
him by the leg and dragged him into the
barn there was something humorous
about his taking the claim-jumper into the
stable he had the air of a father taking
his bad boy to the woodshed

  mr wippet felt a great nausea over-
whelm him an awful bawling issued from
the barn smack smack smack deep
groans from the innermost depths of
scratchys being and lastly the thin whine
of abject surrender jake returned drag-
ging spankee number two by the leg

  theres one little gentleman he re-
marked wholl take his grub standin up
for quite a spell and now little cute
redhead with them scrub bull curls youre
next come with papa

  mr wippet only stared he tried to
speak but only steam issued from his lips

  jake stripped off the little mans over-
coat as a farm boy husks an ear of com
seized his wrist and jerked him from his
feet mr wippet began a frantic squeal-
ing there is something in the claim that
every man resembles some animal bird
t wippet was a little red boar

  his squealing was continuous like a pig
caught under a gate at the first whack
his squeal rose to a piercing intensity it
sawed raggedly through tricky trimmers
frozen soul he was next

  jake worked mr wippet over thor-
oughly he gave every vertebra individ-
ual treatment and added several whacks
to make sure he hadnt overlooked any
tender spots at last the thin whimper

  jake deposited mr wippet with his col-
io

frontier stories

lection of spankees mr trimmer at the
prospectors growled order followed him
into the stable like a hypnotized half-wit

  get off that overcoat commanded
jake tricky tried to obey but the
strength was gone from his hands the
prospector tore the garment from the jack-
legs bony frame

  dont mr ender chattered the fear
ful trickster please dont

ut there was no mercy
in jakes heart these
men had jumped his
claims and struck at
the welfare of his chil-
dren this jackleg
lawyer had gone
through life without re-
ceiving a sound beating such men al-
ways dodged a beating but this one was
going to remember the second day of jan-
uary he would impress on him that there
was no profit or pleasure in trying to steal
what an honest man possessed

  he grabbed trickys arm and slammed
him down on the stable floor tricky tried
to keep his back on the floor but jake
turned him over whack whack whack
shrill yells

  you sound like a woman grunted
jake i swear if you didnt have whis-
kers id think i was heatin a squaw
turn over there whack whack
whack

  im sorry screamed tricky ill
make amends i had nothing to do with
it

  jake finished up with what to him were
a few light whacks however they stuck
trickys undergarments to his flesh the
prospector dragged the whimpering jack-
leg into the sunlight

  now dave if you and bill will help
me load this stuff well soon be shut of
it and turn our thoughts to pleasanter
things

  they threw the half-conscious pike into
the wagon as they would a beef carcass
jake set mr whippet on the seat as he
might a trick monkey scratchy and
tricky were heaved up as though they
were sacks of meal jake tossed wippets
and trickys overcoats into the wagon
placed the lines in the little promoters
helpless hands and turned the team

  good-by and dont come back he
roared tell everybody in driftwood
what jake ender gave you for a new
years gift

  but jake remonstrated dave strong

youre let tin those jumpers go without
signin your claims hack to you better
make them come hack we can take them
over to silver creek and make em sign
up before old judge gary what say i
stop em

  jake waved a huge hand carelessly

  oh they didnt do me any harm bar-
rin hittin di he grinned when i was
down to the railroad i thought bein that
i had a family i d better start gettin an
a- title to the thunderin bar so 
slapped a homestead filin on it that
means a mile of placer all snug and tight
under a homestead filin on top of that
i relocated the claims in dis name two
months ago but didnt get to stick up the
notices when those gents look up the
records theyll find that di ender my
adopted son has the mineral rights and
paw jake the homestead rights if that
dont hold the thunderin bar praver

  dave laughed softly

  having a family makes a man far-
sighted jake well lets have a look at
your babies

he canyon of the thun-
dering bar lay a-dream
in the sunlight of radi-
ant june above the
murmur of the pines
and the subdued laugh-
ter of the stream rose
the clear sweet voices
of the children they had been gathering
violets and shooting stars in the shady
dells now they were straying from a
sarvis berry thicket their lips stained with
juice the girls had woven garlands for
their glinting hair raldy full of berries
looked like some jovial little comus with
his garland of flowers and his juice-stained
face

  di smiled at him indulgently the quiet
lad was supremely happy this was their
canyon this their world-their beautiful
clean healthy world

  jake was shoveling into the sluice with
his rhythmic swing clunk and the shovel
hit the board and turned suns-s-sh and
the impatient hungry sluice mouthed the
gravel tasted it lingeringly ejected the
worthless and retained the gold in its riffles

  jake paused in his work and looked
about him in lordly fashion his domain
his-all his he emitted a vast sigh of
content then came a vision of the lights
of old drift to ruffle his calm a long
king of the thundering bar

long time since he had roared his way
through a red night in that camp a long
long time since he had bellowed his im-
promptu ditties in mikes place

he closed his eyes what was that

ditty he had sung so long ago ah yes

he remembered now leaning on his
shovel handle he sang softly

theres just three reasons why i think-
why a jigger wants a drink 

because hes dry

a pard is nighf
or-any other reason why

so line em up an drink-

but he could not finish the refrain the
far fant laughter of the children silenced
him he opened his eyes there they
were wading the crystal stream calling-
sweetly to him soon di would be shovel-
ing into the sluice at his side soon little
raldy would be spooning gravel with his
tiny wooden shovel soon the girls would
be making playhouses of sticks and stones

io 

 he shook his great head and heaved a
sigh for the passing of the wild reckless
days no more the red nights no more
the reckless jamborees

but there was a recompense that more
than paid for the loss of his old freedom

 i stand winner he murmured happily
 winner a thousand times over

but the song he smiled half-humor-
ously his eyes warm with sentiment there
were plenty of other songs rich in happi-
ness as the thundering bar in gold al-
ready one had formed in his mind while
the children scampered toward him he
threw back his head and in pipe-organ bass
boomed forth

 i do not care for what is gone

for love has coinc and found me

 as long as this old heart beats on

 ill have my babes around me

 now wash the gold sweet stream and sing
 good-by to drunk and bender

 for love has made a first-class saint

explosive gold

by arthur woodward

it was in the early part of march
 shortly after the battle of buena
vista that a supply train bearing some for-
age and munitions for its escort set out
for the town of camargo the chief depot
of supplies at the time from general
taylors camp on the battlefield

  accompanying the train was the usual
escort of cavalry and infantry composed
of ohio volunteers and kentucky rifle-
men the country was infested with rov-
ing bands of guerrilla lancers who made
life miserable for slow baggage trains

  nearing the town of cerrallo scouts
brought word that large bodies of lancers
were in evidence on either side of the
road ahead but before the officer in com-
mand of the detachment could concen-
trate his men the mexicans launched an
attack upon the center of the train cutting
off the rear guard and preventing it from
assisting the feeble force of men in the
center in holding off the mexican trooi
ers

  as intimated the wagons bore many
different brands of supplies now it so
happened that the specie used in paying
off the troops- was packed in boxes similar
in shape size and color to those carrying
ammunition for muskets and pistols

  one of the forty wagons of the central

portion of the train that was cut out by
the guerrillas was loaded with such boxes
these vehicles were immediately driven
out of the road into the thickets where an
eager throng of looters swarmed over
them in so doing one lancer discovered
the boxes of gold

  miradl mirad he shouted look
look dinero money money

  in an instant the gang had all gathered
about that wagon failing to note in their
anxiety to unload the precious money that
some of the boxes had opened and the wa-
gon bed was covered with shiny black
grains

  it was presumed by the americans who
examined the scene a few minutes later
that some hasty caballero had left his ever
present lighted cigar illo fall from his lips
and when the gold blew up it scattered
the remains of some thirty of the lancers
over the surrounding landscape

  as might be expected the word was
passed among the mexicans so the ycn-
gees learned later that the accursed grin-
goes had allowed that particular wagon to
be captured because it was nothing more
nor less than an infernal machine it was
decidedly unsportsmanlike and to show
their resentment they left the train strictly
alone for the rest of the journey

 dayong gets mislaid

 by warren hastings miller

 author of states evidence the ten missing enfields etc

 until the last moment dayong was confident that his chief bruce romney of
 the burma secret service would come to the rescue-but at last death loomed
 and even faithful dayong gave up hope

    bruce wondered what he was making of
  it and moved up alongside the fence the
  babu turned to him thirsty for informa-
  tion

     sahib please he asked did it really
  shed that skull 

    bruce stifled forcibly the whoop of mer-
  riment that arose

    quite like the deer yknow he then
  answered gravely

    thanks sar said the babu satisfied
  and went on to examine the bear-cats cage
  bruce hastened to hide himself in the bam-
  boos where he laughed till he choked

    the blighter he gasped wiping the
  tears from his eyes what creatures of
  theories based on half-remembered facts
  some babus were blind even when a fact
  stared them in the face so long as it failed
  to fit in with the theory-yet the babus
  furnished many of the sivaraj agitators in
  india this one for instance with his
  priceless skull theory based on a hazy rec-
  ollection that deer did shed their antlers
  he was perfectly satisfied in spite of the
  obvious fact that that skull was as big as
  the entire baby hippo

    surely this credulous simpleton couldnt
  be the babu of dayongs message and the
  calcutta cablegram thought bruce as his
  gray eyes sought the man again the wire
  said 

ioo

babu stood leaning
with an air of intense
concentration over the
guard rail of the out-
door hippo tank in the
park of rangoons zoo
he was being watched
with equal concentra-
tion by bruce romney inspector in the
burma secret service who stood under
the shade of a clump of blue bamboos a
short distance down the path for bruce
had an urgent message from dayong vila
his native assistant that might concern this
one

  the babu like all the hindoo pettifog-
gers of his caste was intensely curious
greedy for western knowledge he stud-
ied absorbedly the baby hippo disporting
himself within the enclosure his swarthy
face under a black polo cap embroidered
with gold was furrowed with thought his
slim body in tight cotton jacket and flow-
ery skirt twisted and swayed as the babu s
bulgy eyes traveled alternately from the
live baby hippo in the tank to the bleached
skull of a full-grown one hanging in a
shade tree over it the zoo had hung it
there to show what the hippo would be like
when full grown for they had no adult
specimen but it was causing the babu
much intense thought

  babu bugwan dass dangerous agitator
escaped on ss poona tonight look out

   the india secret service had also wire-
lessed the poonas officers at sea and they
had done their best but who can pick out
one disguised babu among two thousand
skinny rice-coolies bruce and dayong
vila his native assistant who was known
on the books as s  had done their
best too when the poona docked it was
exasperating that inspection if the babu
had only been a trifle fat as most of them
were but the shipload of coolies was
like the three negroes crambo mumbo
and jumbo-all berry much alike espe-
cially jumbo and the pestilent babu no-
torious as a sworaj agitator in calcutta
had got loose in burma

  bruce was not long in hearing about
him rumors vapored up out of the ba-
zaars of a great hindoo buddhist who was
preaching mighty words in the kyaungs
monasteries of rangoon bruce wanted
keenly to know what the mighty words
were so he sent dayong disguised as a
buddhist pyit-shin disciple around the
monasteries to see and hear the preacher
and let him know what he looked like and
what sort of doctrine he was preaching
bruce had had some priceless messages
from dayong at the seat of war he treas-
ured the following

  i here with much glaa therefore with
humble begging that you no can do re-
gressions without hesitation i beg to
have a pause dayong

   it was written on a strip of talipot palm
leaf the crude letters scratched with a steel
stylus that argued that dayong had ac-
cess to the pongyis writing materials was
perhaps a sort of secretary for the babu
bugwan dass already since he knew hin-
dustani he seemed to be getting on well
the regressions part of it meant that he
was not to be recalled just yet

  this morning had come another mes-
sage brief and enigmatical it was

  rangoon zoo seven oclock must be

  bruce had come to the zoo expecting
both their babu and dayong the latter per-
haps having evidence valid for his sum-
mary arrest a crisis of some sort had ar-
rived he was sure but there was only
this ass of the hippo skull-no dayong

ruce followed the park

lanes under nicobar
palms and enormous
banyans to a bench
commanding the zoo
gate where he could
watch for dayong and
another babu he laid
his white topee on the bench exposing his
thick black locks to the fresh monsoon
breeze he threw open his khaki norfolk
jacket the coo morning air felt good on
his bare knees and his sunburned thighs
in the loose khaki running shorts his
swagger-stick tapped idly against his golf
hose as he watched alternately the gate and
that wandering babu now studying the
cagtes of mewing leopards complaining
tigers whooping burma gibbons he could
not believe that that simpleton could be the
notorious agitator bugwan dass

  the park was already full of gay bur-
mese little ladies like walking flowers with
their gossamer scarfs blowing out before
them in two wisps of color laughing bur-
mans in silken skirts and jackets and head-
gear and carrying parasols that were
luminous discs of color hindoos seldom
came here bruce wondered why even this
babu should be visiting the zoo certainly
not to look at the animals to meet some-
one exchange a message with some
pongyi he could swear that the babu
was never near any of the three yellow
robed priests that had entered and of
dayong and the really important babu of
the calcutta cable not a sign

  bruce was worried there had been a
miscarriage somewhere and as the only
babu who had come was now hurrying out
the gate he got up and followed

  up along victoria road and past the
cantonments of the european troops on the
hill the babu hurried his slender skirted
figure reminding bruce of those terrible
styles of the nineties when ladies dressed
like emaciated hatracks he crossed ah-
lone road presently the massive golden
pagoda of shwe dagon rising high out of
its hill of greenery to the left and piercing
the brazen blue of the sky the babu kept
on under the shade now of the great trees
that overhung the pongyi kyaung daik
the head monastery of the priests of shwe
dagon itself

  bruce closed up his heart quickening
was he going in there if so this had
really been his man-and where was day-
ong all this time it was intensely exas-
perating  without dayong and some tan-
gible written evidence it would have been
dayong gets mislaid

impossible anyhow to arrest this babu a
ripe plot of dayongs to nab him at the
zoo had evidently fizzled out

  bruce watched the babu turn in at the
gate in the compound wall that enclosed the
monastery and stamped his foot with vexa-
tion that babu zvas bugwan dass and he
had not been able to lay a finger on him
he noted long lines of gharries parked un-
der the shade of the trees some budd-
hist ceremony downtown was evidently
coming off this day and the whole monas-
tery was going to it-in closed gharries of
course they would march back to this
kyaung with the image or relic or what-
ever it was

  the air of a crisis hung over all this
thing dayong was in that monastery in
the thick of it the babu had brought
about some sort of climax to his preachings
here dayong had got him over to the
zoo on some pretext right at the apex of
things but had missed out himself some-
how aggravating

  bruce had hardly got back to his office
in the big police building on phayre street
before the purpose of the gharries was ex-
plained the telephone rang

  derwent talking old chap i say rum
show starting down here thought you
might like to see it meet me on sule pa-
goda wharf

  thanks so much derwent five min-
utes so long

  bruces keen gray eyes snapped with
excitement things were coming to a
head

own on the wharf he
met derwent the
freightinaster a life
size bronze buddha had
already been taken out
of its crate and was be-
ing transferred to a
gaudy litter of red and
gold by four strong coolies bruce took
notes the buddha was weathered green
in color sitting cross-legged in the conven-
tional attitude his right hand in his lap
holding a lotus flower of carved moon-
stone his left curled over his knee his
eyes were closed and on his calm face
played the enigmatical smile of one who
has attained to supreme wisdom his head
was crowned with the usual cap of naga
scales and had a huge ruby glowing in the
peak of the crown

  consigned to us from calcutta said
derwent the pongyis have come for it
ysee and therell be no end of a parade

in

  from calcutta echoed bruce most
unusual what theres no love lost be-
tween the buddhists of india and ours in
burma

  thought youd like to know said
dement heres the shippers address
in calicut if you like hindoo firm that i
never heard of before

   bruce felt that the subtle hand of bug-
wan dass was in it and would have liked
to warn the pongyis to beware of greeks
bearing gifts instead he wired darwood
of the india secret service in calcutta to
trace up that buddha

   when he got out into the streets again
the parade was already passing up china
street it was headed by four naked
blacks garlanded with jasmine flowers who
danced a complicated shuffle across and
across china street playing on small flutes
after them marched a tall coolie carrying
a seven-storied chandelier glittering with
flashing crystals and then a burmese band
playing k-k-katy vigorously and all out
of tune

  followed a long line of yellow-robed
pongyis their shaven heads shaded by fans
then an equally jong double file of nov-
ices yellow-robed with stiff bootbrushes of
black hair not having yet attained to the
holiness of a shave bruce looked in vain
for dayong among them he clicked his
teeth with worry dayong was in trouble
recognized perhaps and now a prisoner up
in the pongyi kyaung daik

  on the red and gold litter carried by
four struggling coolies came next the
bronze buddha moving in triumph be-
hind him tottered two venerable sawdaws
high priests in the white robes of those
who have nearly attained to nirvana and
then the abbot of the monastery a stern
and shaven fanatic with a long scrawny
neck hooking up from his yellow cowl like
the neck of a vulture with him was step-
ping out the great hindoo babu bugwan
dass-and he was none other than bruces
imbecile of the zoo

   the blighter muttered bruce darent
touch him now and he knows it horrible
sacrilege to take him out of this religious
procession besides without dayong we
have no proof of anything against him if
dayong had only been there this morning
confound him i lay a quid hed intended
to

   he saw the parade as far as the foot of
pagoda road the gleaming golden shaft
of shwe dagon rose hazily into the blue
at the far end of it a long distance two
miles yet bruce did not care to walk that


frontier stories

far in the hot rangoon sun besides he was
consumed with anxiety over dayong he
hurried back to his office expecting a mes-
sage

  there was one a bit of palm leaf strip
and on it was scratched this pathetic ap-
peal

  i	am loosing humble life here shzoe
dagon moon if not having honorable
assistance dayong

  bruce snorted scratched the curly black
hair that was baldish and streaked with
gray over his temples and went into action
immediately

  shwe dagon moon that was to
be the time and the place of his execution
he had evidently been recognized ex-
posed somehow in the monastery the
buddhists would not kill him because of
their religion but bugwan dass would
find a way to once he knew that dayong
was an agent of the hated secret service
but how get into the sacred precincts of
shwe dagon it was forbidden to all
white men even to the prince of wales
when he was in rangoon on a royal visit
four long staircases led up to the great
golden pagoda each guarded day and
night by a pongyi you could not force
an entrance it would cause no end of a re-
ligious row

  bruce conjectured that the bronze
buddha would be installed there in one of
the hundreds of shrines around the base of
the pagoda it would be done secretly in
the dark of this night and next day the
presence of the image would be proclaimed
to the worshippers as a miracle by the
pongyis shwe dagon was crowded with
miraculous tis and images votive offerings
from wealthy princes all over the east
the temple was worth thirteen million dol-
lars when the moon came up there would
be installation rites on that lonely platform
-with dayong as a victim or a sacrifice
somehow trust bugwan dass for that
nor could bruce rescue him by force

niches its huge white plaster image of the
buddha occupying all one end of the mon-
astery dayong listened to doctrine joined
the novices in the evening lauds and that 
night he was rewarded by seeing the visit- 
ing babu enter accompanied by the head
pongyi

  dayong eyed the bengali with disfavor i

   im e cheap-pidgin feller he com- 
mented on the babus external character-
istics

  he listened while the head pongyi intro- i
duced the rao bugwan dass lama of the i
buddhists in india and the babu began a
discourse of all the hazy obscure un- 
intelligible distorted and ambiguous expo- 
sitions of the buddhist creed hopelessly i
garbled with brahminism that dayong had i
ever heard that was the pinnacle nebu i
lous talk about the all-in-all of the all-per- i
vadingness everything the good and the i
bad the fine and the base creeds and the i
lack of them all coming to the same thing i
in the end for they were all but manifes- i
tations of the same one

   im e wuzzy-wuzzy commented da- i
yong as the flow of high-pitched hindus- i
tani went on

  the babu could see by the stony faces i
that he was not getting anywhere with i
these austere pongyis and soon shifted to i
the grievances of the buddhists in india 
they had a thousand thousand of them all i
due to the white oppressors who would 
soon be thrown out of the country and i
back across the sea whence they came i
still a listless silence only dayong listen-
ing intently the pongyis hadnt any griev- j
ances here

  then the babu changed subtly his key-
note now was power a thing that no body 
of men gets enough of he spoke of the
recent edict forbidding all white persons to
enter kyaungs and pagoda temples the
british government had allowed that to
spare the buddhists the annoyance of gap- t
ing tourists in their holy places but bug- 
wan dass was careful to point out that it
was granted because the british raj was
afraid of the pongyis it had but few
troops in burma it dared not refuse any t
reasonable request

  there were murmurs of interest at that
everyone was thinking what else they
might want-and the babu was prompt
with his suggestion we should demand a
greater share in the government he cried
as in the old days of the burmese kings

  he touched the right note there growls
of assent answered him the old sawdaws
remembered the times when the priests

aong had indeed
been having a rather
dark-brown time of it
at first it had been
easy for him to enter
the lammadaw ky-
aung presenting him-
self as a candidate for
novice he was given a yellow robe ac-
customed himself to the dim dark interior
with its rows of tall teak columns its
dayong gets mislaid

word was law when pongyis managed the
throne itself behind the scenes the
younger men were eager to get that power
back there was a grievance indeed bug-
wan dass spoke on the whole monastery
with him the british raj he vociferated
ignored their power and why because
the english were selfish as in india
wanted the whole country for themselves
and cared nothing for the people and
who was closer to the life of the people
than the yellow-robed pongyi

  he did not point out the obvious fact
that the british raj gave no church any
special power mohammedan brahmin
buddhist nor christian he kept before
them the point that the pongyis taught all
the schools that burma was the most liter-
ate country in the world eighty-seven per
cent of its boys knowing how to read and
write and that all that was needed now
was to demand the vote for them-and
right soon the pongyis would control all
the power of the government

  bugwan dass had won he had given
them a new idea to work on and he was
sent up in triumph to the kyaung daik of
shwe dagon to preach the new idea there
and dayong as his most ardent disciple
went along

  dayong squatted on his hams malay-
fashion in the niche that had been allot-
ted him as the babus secretary consider-
ing to him as a malay and a wanderer
who had seen much of life all this talk of
ruling by the many was wuzzy-wuzzy
the many were fools they knew nothing
of government and would simply vote as
the pongyis told them give him a sul-
tan  one with a strong sword and that
sultan was the british raj a benign and
beneficent sultan as anyone could see
therefore this babu with his pestiferous
idea was a trouble maker and a dangerous
agitator even as tuan bruce had said
the thing to do was to get him out of the
kyaung alone somehow and with some
written evidence of sedition upon him
then he and tuan bruce could arrest the
foolish babu

  dayong noticed a pongyi looking at him
blackly from an alcove and made haste to
cross his legs in the attitude of the buddha
and go on with his work he belabored
himself mildly for forgetting that the com-
fortable malay squat was dangerous here
tt irked him this cross-legged posture of
the infidels the other was natural and he
could not help relaxing into it sometimes
however things were coming along the
babu was going to dictate a pronuncia-

lx

mento- soon to be sent out to all the forty
thousand monasteries of burma then it
was that dayong took steel stylus and a
strip of palm leaf from his writing ma-
terials and wrote his with much glad
message to tuan bruce he rubbed over
the scratches with an ink rag bringing out
the writing sharp and distinct folded it
into a packet tied it with a bit of leaf strip
and went out to throw it over the com-
pound wall where his shop boy would find
it thus simply had they arranged the de-
tails of communication

  he had hardly got back before the babu
entered the niche he was puffed up with
importance now breathing heavily with
the profundity of his thoughts his black
eyes with their yellow whites staring as
those of a seer

  take stylus and write disciple he
said grandiloquently i the rao bugwan
dass lama of the temple which is in mind-
napur do call on all monasteries of the
way in burma to rise against the oppres-
sor  put that in burmese disciple

  dayong scratched the round curlicue
burmese characters on the fine-ribbed tali-
pot palm leaf he looked up at the babu
inquiringly

  too long have the faithful remained in-
ert  since the days of the kings when
has any pongyi had a voice in the govern-
ment  followed a turgid diatribe against
the british raj the gist of which was a
command for all monasteries throughout
burma to unite in demanding the vote

  dayong hummed with unholy glee as he
wrote if the babu had simply confined
himself to the vote he would have been per-
fectly safe for there was no sedition in
that

  but he simply could not keep the szvaraj
jargon out of it incendiary and treasonable
talk that no government would tolerate
the pronunciamento took four long strips
to set forth when bugwan dass had
signed it dayong did the strips together
into a booklet an enigmatical smile play-
ing across his hard malay features he
had the babu now remained a way to get
him out of the kyaung just once and as
soon as possible

  the babu having got that weighty mat-
ter out of his system was in a mood for
conversation he liked this disciple who
could talk hindustani the language diffi-
culty had barred him from much discourse
with the pongyis dayong considered the
innate curiosity of all babus their greed
for miscellaneous knowledge and thought
upon how he could make this foible profit-


frontier stories

able well aside from the sea natural
history was the subject that he was most
up on babus were generally interested in
that too because most sahibs were and it
gave them excuse to air their learning
when talking with sahibs

  then dayong had a gorgeous idea he
bethought him of that baby hippo in the
zoo and the skull of a full-grown one hang-
ing in the tree over his tank why not
challenge the babus grasshopper mind with
that he led the conversation artfully
around to animals and from that to the
habit of some of them of shedding their
antlers

  the hippo sheds his skull you know
said dayong casually in corroboration

  sheds his skull the babu gasped
but how can an animal lose his head and
live disciple he demanded

  nay quite easily he grows a new
one underneath as does the snake re-
torted dayong

  nothing would do but the babu must see
that marvel to believe it dayong had but
to mention the evidence right here in the
rangoon zoo and he had him that night
it was that he had sent off the must be
message to tuan bruce

ut dayong was due for
an unpleasant surprise
next morning he was
going out the gate with
bugwan dass-with the
damning pronuncia-
mento in his pocket and
everything set for an
arrest-when the two novices on guard
stopped him peremptorily

  pass rao bugwan bass-but not the
novice they said

  the babu protested

  most interesting naturalistic phenome-
nons he explained but the guards were
obdurate

  the sawdaw wants to see you novice
said one of them

  dayong turned back with regrets wnth
exasperation he could not force his way
through without a scene that would arouse
suspicion he decided immediately to
jump the compound wall at the first chance
and join the babu outside he simply
could not let this chance be inst and lost
it would be if he did not go along for
tuan bruce could do nothing without him
but look over his man

  that chance was denied him

  come with me-novice who squats
snarled the bigger of the guards seizing

him firmly by the arm dayong had a
mad impulse to throw him off and make
good his escape for those last words were
ominous they had been watching him
suspecting him there is a peculiar but
unmistakable posture in the malay squat
an ease to it due to long usage

  he was led into the presence of the two
venerable sawdaws seated in the glory of
their white robes in an inner room be-
tween them was the hard-faced abbot mas-
ter of the monastery yellow-robed eyeing
him malignantly as the two guards brought
dayong before them and salaaming low
at one side was a wretched hindoo coolie
perhaps one of the sudras who worked
around the place

  it is dayong vila who keeps the animal
shop in china street o presences the
man declared after one look at dayong

  and what of it o greater glory
asked dayong unabashed though his heart
was pounding inwardly may not a poor
shopman become a novice in the way of
life

  true quavered the venerable one no
one is denied knowledge of the way

  well then said dayong brazenly

  only this broke in the abbot

  in his lap was a package of szlaraj tracts
printed on vile lucknow block type that
dayong recognized as belonging to bug
wan dass on the packet lay a small lea-
therbound notebook dirty and greasy from
the babus thumbs the abbot was tapping
it with a scrawny finger his eyes bent
menacingly on dayong

  in this book the learned babu has lists
of all saliibs in the kumpanie british
government and the third name on one
of those lists is dayong vila thou art
in the secret pay of the british raj nov-
ice he accused

  dayongs face set stonily he was neatly
caught he cursed all his malay gods
from iskhander back to the twin rulers
of the universe that he had not denied the
coolie stoutly it was too late now the
three shaven polls were looking at him fix-
edly and fear was growing in the slit
eyes of both the old sawdaws as the full
meaning of the abbots accusation came to
them they were all deeply implicated as
deeply as the rao bugwan dass himself
and this secret service man knew all

  dayong could see that before this fear
all the humane tenets of their religion
would be as wax here was something
real personal their necks already felt un-
comfortable with premonitions of the
hangmans noose he was not surprised
dayong gets mislaid

  when the abbot eyed him malevolently

    he must never leave this kyaung alive
  venerable ones came the sentence

    aye muttered the younger of the
  sawdaws but we cannot kill the lord
  buddha forbade the taking of life

    in truth and we kill not o greater
  glory but the rao those in india are-
  ahem-not so strict

    dayong felt as he would have put it
  belly blong him walk about a bit inside
  he could expect nothing but swift death
  once the babu learned who his private sec-
  retary really was

    the two old sawdaws rocked with agita-
  tion as they meditated on this crafty sug-
  gestion of their abbots on their words
   now hung dayongs fate both of them
  were trembling with fear it was their
  first contact in many years with the reali-
  ties of the outside world

    can we permit a man to be slain be-
  fore all the pongyis and the novices a
  pollution in the house of the lord buddha
  that would let in all the evil nats in the
  world quavered the younger sawdaw his
  mind torn between fear of this novice who
  knew too much and the fears of appalling
  consequences in the spirit world it might
  keep him out of nirvana this thing his
  conscience was telling him it was hard
  after so many holy lives leading to the saw-
  dawship and its chance for the buddhist
  heaven

    he could die secretly or accidentally
  leave that to the rao countered the ab-
  bot

    yet on all of us is his blood wept the
  younger sawdaw disconsolately

    a profound silence reigned after that
  dayong saw that it was going to be hard
  for this monastery of devout buddhists to
  bring themselves to putting him to death
  or even consenting to let the babu do it
  he took heart an imprisonment prob-
  ably and as they had no dungeon it
  would be some clumsy thing of chains
  which he could easily manage tuan bruce
  would rescue him once he knew of his
  predicament

    then the elder sawdaw spoke he was
  even more frightened than the younger for
  heavy would be the hand of the british
  raj upon him as head of this monastery
  for harboring and abetting a dangerous
  hindoo agitator

    there is a way he said and everyone
  breathed his relief and the abbot was all at-
  tention in the old days of the kings it
  was done i was but a young pongyi then
  at the consecration of the sule pagoda it

was in those days we sacrificed a male-
factor to appease the evil nats the lord
buddha approved doubtless for did not
the man end his evil days and begin on
earth again as a flea mayhap look you
iny children he went on more strongly
the rao is presenting to shwe dagon a
new image of the enlightened one the
niche for it is ready it arrives in state
today and then comes the moon and
our ritual of consecration during which

the rao-

  he ceased and waved a lean brown hand
in the direction of dayong

  the abbot immediately took charge of
the situation take him out you two
he directed the novices guarding dayong
see that he is securely chained and out
in the compound that he pollute our ky-
aung no longer it is a condemned male-
factor that false novice

  he waved dayong away with disgust

            egsjshe novices hustled him
i is out they called more
 to help for something
if in the very feel of day-
ongs rippling muscles
el under their hands
f warned them that the
  malay would be more
than a match for them both if he got the
least chance heavily guarded he was led
out to a tree in the compound chains ap-
peared were hammered solidly to his an-
kles his wrists they encircled the tree
so there was little hope of any escape by
himself then they left him for most of
the novices were due for the parade and
did not want to miss the glories of it

  dayong squatted on his hams in com-
fort at last and considered with the slow
patience of the east he needed tuan
bruce now and when certainly not
while these chains were on him and around
the tree somewhere between here and
the platform of shwe dagon then the
east steps to it led directly out of the ky-
aung it was all sacred ground forbid-
den by the british raj itself to all white
men still there if anywhere bruce tuan
could station himself and some sikhs for
a rescue

  dayong decided to give him the bare
facts of his execution and trust in his chief
to plan the rescue he got the babus pro-
nunciamento out of his girdle broke off a
blank end of a strip and wrote his honor-
able assistance message on it with a pin
out of his girdle he dug up a pebble with
his foes to give the thing weight watched

his chance and threw it over the compound
wall

  the sounds of the procession band had
reached his ears before dayong thought of
that pronunciainento the babu would
come hurrying out for it as soon as he got
back for by this time the abbot would have
told him the news and what was going to
be done about it the pronunciamento
would be priceless evidence if everything
came out all right after all dayong rea-
soned thinking as s  of the secret
service

  he had slipped up on his plan to nab
the babu at the zoo to be able to pro-
duce the pronunciamento at the right time
would retrieve his blur der he drew out
the packet again and buried it near by

  and none too soon for the parade of the
bronze buddha was entering the monas-
tery gate and no sooner had it disbanded
than bugwan dass came running out his
face dark and threatening

   so he piped in his high falsetto voice
speaking babu-english in his passion i
knock off your eyeballs and breaking your
tooth-jaws budmashl he squeaked and
did so brutally forthwith

  he was only stopped by a novice sent
out with a remonstrance from the sawdaw
dayong gathered what was left of himself
on his hams and waited impassively

  and where is my pronunciamento to
the kyaungs spy the babu hissed i
look in all writings and not finding-dung
of a toad

  it went by the pongyi mawng thit to
pegu this morning master lied dayong
injuredly why give thy servant so
much-much beatings

  the babu was taken aback at that for a
pongyi of the pegu kyaung had left that
morning and he had directed dayong to
give him the document himself nor could
he prove othenvise however he searched
the malay thoroughly and gave a ha
of discovery as his hand encountered a
leather charm bag hanging about dayongs
neck by a thong

  it contained a charm very potent in love
affairs nothing less than the pelt of an un-
born tiger cub and six bristles from the
mothers chops bugwan dass threw the
treasures on the ground and spat upon
them while dayong glowered but the
babu had not found his pronunciamento
presently he gave up and called dayong a
pig a mountain of cowdung the son of a
noseless mother and the father of a thou-
sand unclean worms

  may allah cut out your heart and poi-

  son a million snakes with it muttered
dayong in retort as the babu left him

  he gathered up his charms again and put
them back into the leather locket with
them went the pronunciamento tightly
folded

  the hot burma afternoon wore on eve-
ning lauds like a strong gregorian chant
in many male voices sounded from the
monastery it grew dark and the big stars
spangled overhead a velvet black sky later
came lanterns novices with hammers and
chisels the chains were cut where they
encircled dayongs tree dayong heard
the silent struggle and heavy breathing of
coolies carrying the bronze buddha on its
dais out of the monastery gate up under
the black roof of the stairway it would go
to be lodged in the pitchy darkness in a
niche up under the base of shwe dagon
and then the moon would rise-and his
time would come

con after dayong was
led to the gate sur-
rounded by eager and
excited novices all try-
ing to grip him fast
ahead in the darkness
the long procession of
pongyis had already
formed the novices filed out after them
two by two a dozen followed with him
in their midst two of the biggest holding
him the rest in lines on each side and be-
hind but they were amateur jailers at
best thought dayong with a subtle malay
smile as he slowly gathered chain links up
into his fists with his fingers they should
not have left those chains on him as it
was they made fine striking weapons a
sudden wrench both arms lashing out with
those chains flailing-he was tensed and
ready for it as soon as the first sign of
tuan bruce and his sikhs appeared

   but they passed up the steps without the
least hint of any rescue party dayong
kept peering right and left into the dark-
ness surely bruce tuan and the sihks
would be hidden in the bushes on either
side of the low brick walls that guarded
this staircase but the procession contin-
ued up and up

  baik very well then thought
dayong letter im e no find can do
alone must be

  he decided to use those chains the mo-
ment bugwan dass attempted to lay hands
on him a sudden leap striking right and
left with them then a dash for escape
there were three other staircases leading
dayong gets mislaid

down from shwe dagon and only one
pongyi guarded each at night

  the moon was a slender sickle in the
east when the procession came out on the
platform of shwe dagon dayong looked
around curiously it was empty and de-
serted of human beings now a vast space
of flat paving faced by the four archways
of the stairs it was planted thick with
tall poles of silver and gold with glittering
jewels hanging from the tis at their tops
they were votive offerings from wealthy
buddhists all over the east but dayong
regarded them as so much wondrous loot
and ruminated on how it would be to turn
dacoit and grow rich

  they passed shrine after shrine around
the base of the great golden pagoda in
each a buddha-image of marble alabaster
silver gold malachite all life size and
worth millions of rupees up above in the
night towered the gleaming gold shaft ris-
ing in huge rounded swelling curves to the
ti high in the sky nearly four hundred feet
above a continuous tinkle of silver bells
came floating down from the ti with it the
dusky flash of jewels sparkled down from
even the faint light of the moon dayong
merely noted that it was after midnight
for the electrics that outlined shwe dagon
had been turned off

  they reached the shrine of the bronze
buddha calm cross-legged it sat in the
depths of the niche eyes closed the enig-
matical smile of asia playing on the thin
lips the right hand holding a carved lotus
flower of white moonstone a single huge
ruby smouldered at the peak of the crown
of green bronze naga scales that covered
the head of the image

  as one man the whole procession went
flat on their faces before it the vener-
able sawdaw droned a chant there were
responses at intervals from all the kneeling
lines of yellow robes the moon rose
slowly higher as the ritual of installation
went on and on

  om-nrani-padnc-hum o in-mani
-padne-hum the old sawdaw con-
cluded the ceremony with the measured ac-
cents of an ancient sanscrit rune

  a stern command barked out from the
abbot all the worshippers sat up cross-
legged novices around dayong tore off
his yellow robe and stripped it to shreds
thus making him a nothing a less than an
animal dayong squatted back only in his
loin-cloth now-but ready with a fistful of
chain in either hand all this adoration
before the image of a mere man who had
claimed to have discovered the only way of

ii

life was to him but the foolishness of in-
fidels

   for allah he is god and there is none
like unto him that verse of the koran
kept ringing in his ears dayong was not
impressed rather scornful as only a
malay well fortified in the precepts of the
faith can be

   proceed rao ordered the abbott

   dayong eyed the babu disdainfully bug-
wan dass was now on his feet his hand
on the hilt of a small dagger at his belt

  may maggots consume your liver
muttered dayong

  the hindoo approached step by step
an invocation propitiary to the evil nats
was being raised by the abbots voice day-
ong gathered that he w-as now going to be
sacrificed by this babu and wras only curi-
ous as to just how he proposed to do it
with that dagger his muscles tensed like
steel under the grip of the two novices who
held him the babu had got behind him
dayong listened with junglewise ears at
the last and nearest footfall he was going
to-

  and then there was a general gasp for
the buddha had suddenly come to life

ayong saw that its
eyes were now open
and looking upon them
all sternly from the
depths of its niche he
heard low cries of awe
of fear of sheer terror
arise from all the pon-
gyis and novices heard the babu behind
him gibbering like a scared ape and felt
the novices that gripped him loosen their
holds slowly as the timeless movement
of an automaton the buddha swung out its
left arm ghastly green in the moonlight
it was its index finger pointing directly at
bugwan dass the whole monastery went
flat on their foreheads before it this mira-
cle this incarnation of the lord buddha in
one of his own statues

  they had convincing precedent for it-
that buddha in amarapura who shed tears
prophesying calamities the one in the
seyin temple who spake oracles hollowly
every one of them devoutly believed that
this one was miraculous and went pros-
trate in frightened prayer before it the
babus teeth were chattering before that ac-
cusing arm his knees knocking the ve-
neer of his western education had left him
like a rent veil and his hindoo elder gods
took possession of him like the others
he went to his knees

  instantly the buddhas placid face wrin-
kled to a stern frown of command his eyes
now on dayong his lips parted in a silent
word grim lines graven from nose to
mouth dayong recognized that face in-
stantly-bruce romneys-and smote
heavily upon the balms bowed head with
a welt of his chain obeying further signs
from the buddha he picked up the uncon-
scious babu and carried him behind the
prostrate lines of pongyis to join his chief
who had now leaped noiselessly down from
the niche together they hurried around
the base of shwe dagon where bruce
swiftly picked up a bundle slipped on the
yellow pongyi robe that made it and rip-
ped off his green crown crushing the paper
scales of it into a wad and thrusting it
within the robe

  he now made a very reverend pongyi
indeed and dayong grinned at the stiff
bootbrush of black hair that crowned his
chiefs dark face and was bursting with
delight over the cleverness of his rescue
without doubt it was a feather in the cap
of the secret service

  bruce laid finger on lips

  wvve not got much time he whis-
pered for those beggars will come out
of their prayers ck duin to have another
look comt

  they went on around into the deep
shadows of the western side of shwe
dagon the four coolies were there
standing beside the litter on which sat the
bronze buddha

  ye have my leave to go said bruce
walking up to them authoritatively has-
ten now to the shrine outcast ones for
the whole monastery waits should the
abbot demand why ye were late answer
him only this the lord buddha did not
approve 

  that ought to hold em said bruce to
dayong as the coolies salaamed and strug-
gled off around the vast curve of shwe
dagons base with their burden come
along with the babu out we go

  down the dark flight of the west stair-
case they hurried bruce in the lead day-
ong following half buried under the in-
sensible babu

  lo a hindoo sneak-thief that was
caught hiding among the sacred relics
brother said bruce to the pongyi on
guard at the foot of the stairs and indicat-
ing the babu with a jerk of his thumb over
shoulder call me a gharry and two sikh
policemen

  the pongyi nodded and blew on his

whistle he had evidently met this pongyi
with the black hair and the livid face be-
fore and was entirely obliging once driv-
ing off in the gharry with the sikhs seated
opposite and their unconscious prisoner be-
tween them bruce let out a sigh of relaxa-
tion

  went off rather well didnt it what
he said cheerily to dayong couldnt
force shwe dagon with the sikhs ysee
so i thought of impersonating that bronze
buddha which by the way was stolen
from the jaipur temple by swaraj agents
to stir up trouble i learn from calcutta

  to be buddha wasnt difficult at all-
tube of green stage paint and a paper
crown a chap once came to a gymkhana
ball as apollo y know to get in i just
put in the pongyi robe and got past that
blighter at the west stairs went up and
waited around a bit met the coolies com-
ing up with the real buddha and told them

lo	take it around to the west side and wait
until i came for them then disrobed put
on the crown and got in the niche myself
pretty good for a lone raid eh what day-
ong bruce laughed merrily and you
were right keen with your end of it-when
we left em all praying away like gooduns
by the way how did you come to get mis-
laid as it were this morning dayong

  the malay grinned maliciously

  wait tuan he said then kicked the
babu viciously in the shins

  the babu groaned and came shuddering
out of his stupor his eyes opened and he
looked just once at the turbaned sikhs
on either side and the handcuffs on his
wrists then began to blubber

  dayong kicked him once more

  you babu-feller you still tink litty
hippo him shedm skull he asked coyly

  bruce comprehending at once exploded
with laughter

  so that was it eh oh priceless day-
ong and you had evidence i suppose
but got held up yourself  he asked we
have nothing against him yet y know but
assault with intent to kill and will have
difficulty in proving that satisfactorily

  sure grinned dayong out of the
leather wallet on his neck he produced one
dried tiger-cub pelt that was a potent
charm against fear six bristles from the
mothers chops that were useful in love
affairs and the pronunciamento of one
bugwan dass-and with that last the case
against the babu stood complete

  good work s  said bruce fer-
vidly and gripped the malays hand

author of the master squatter oklahoma  etc

 into the rich long-leaf pine lands of east texas came sam smedley scornful
 of the squirrelrhunter natives and ruthlessly intent on snatching a fortune in
 timber surely his plans moved forxoard-until they snapped on the honesty

of a texas timber-cruiser

heres tom stone
out in the bunk-
shack sir

tell him to come
here

  after giving the or-
der mr sam smedley
eased himself into a
strong chair took off his hat and mopped
his brow it was only the first of may
but it was hot in east texas mr smed-
ley was a heavy man with hanging jowls
and a good-natured face it was spoiled
however by two dark pools of greed and
avarice that lay far back in his eyes

  originally the smedley lumber com-
pany were hardwood people operating in
southeast missouri and in northeast ar-
kansas when their holdings had been
worked out they drifted into the piney
woods of texas with the coming of a
railroad into the great pine forests mills
had sprung up and prospered while work-
ing timber that was close to the line as
good saw-timber became scarce a small
mill-owner by the name of frank thomp-
son conceived the idea of acquiring cheap
land at a distance of ten miles from the
main line of the railroad and hauling the
timber thompson was a visionary and
failed because of the condition of the ter-
rain over which he must route his teams
scouting for a new field sam smedleys
sharp nose for business smelled out the
mortgages on the silent thompson mill

 and almost before thompson knew it he
 was ousted and the smedley lumber com-
 pany was in possession

   it was freely predicted that smedley
 would fail but the shrewd lumberman had
 plenty of money to build a tap line of rail-
 way to the main line this tap would be
 on his own land half way and he was
 secretly acquiring right of way the rest
 of the ten miles he knew a private line
 hadnt the right of eminent domain and
 he didnt purpose being held up by some
 greedy land-owner

   tom stone whom the lumberman had
 ordered to his presence was a timber-
 cruiser he had been three years with
 t smedley and was a valuable man smed-
 ley had bought the stumpage on many a
 tract merely on stones estimate and never
 once had the young man been at fault

   a tall broad-shouldered young fellow
 collar open and neck rising from his mas-
 sive body like a young pine tree strode into
 the office his laced boots thumping on the
 floor there was a questioning look in his
 calm gray eyes as he ran his fingers
 through his crinkly brown hair

   send for me mr smedley he asked

   yes sit down you cruised that three
 sections of holderness land that lies just
 below us on the east side of the neches

    yes sir

    sure yo figgers are right specially on
 the long-leaf stuff and the cypress

    yes sir

rrr


frontier stories

   well theres a hitch in the trade for it
we cant buy the land outright as we have
from the rest of these poor squirrel-hunt-
ers in here it belongs to a non-resident
and theres minor heirs or something
yes sir

  its good timber and i want it but-

   yes sir

  shut up dont stand there and say
yes sir to me like a damned parrot im
trying to tell you something and i want
you to pay particular attention i found
a way to get the stumpage and thats all
i want the land wont be worth a damn
except to pay taxes on for two hundred
years after the saw-stock is offn it

  theres a lawyer joe nelms at the
county seat hes agent for the rental of
the little farm thats on the tract nelms
says that if i can get an affidavit of an ex-
pert as to the timber on the land hes sure
he can get an order to sell it to me at
current prices with a good discount for
cash

  that would be a fair way to handle it
sir said stone

  yes snarled smedley fair enough
but it aint handled yet  got yo figures
on that tract right here in my desk now
heres what i want you to do go into
town get nelms to write the affidavit like
he wants it you give him the figgers-
split exactly in the middle-and when its
ready you go before the county clcrk sign
the affidavit and swear to it

  why-why mr smedley you never
asked me to do a thing like that before
no snapped smedley because i
never wanted you to before im not ask-
ing you now im telling you maybe you
understand that

  an odd look came into tom stones
narrowed and unblinking eyes

  mr smedley youve been pretty white
to me the last three years he said quietly
for that reason alone youre the only
man on earth that could make that proposi-
tion to me and not get knocked kicking for
his trouble

  mean you dont want to do it

  i mean a little more than that i mean
id see you or any other man in hell far-
ther than a jaybird can fly by christmas
before id do it

  all right snapped smedley youre
fired

you cant fire me i quit the instant
you insulted me with your dirty proposal
get to hell out of my mill-yard
stormed smedley i dont want a man
jike you talking to my men

  i won t talk to them i dont do busi-
ness that way and turning on his heel
i om stone went to the boarding shack

  he packed his scant belongings in a
gunny-bag threw it over his shoulder and
trudged away toward the railroad over
foot-logs where moccasins slid into slimy
waters and alligators blinked in the sun-
shine on the edge of the swamps

  tom had tramped five miles and was
clear of smedleys land before he con-
sented to stop and rest he was now on
cut-over land within live miles of town
which was due north of where the smedley
mill was located

  stone took a blue-print map from his
pocket and began studying it the tract
of land that he was sitting on at that mo-
ment according to the map was four hun-
dred and eighty varas-about a quarter of
a mile-wide and about two miles long
it lay across the neches river and ex-
tended out a mile from the stream on each
side obviously it was a strip that had
jain between two old spanish grants that
intrigued mr stone as did also two
leagues of land that lay on the west side
of the river directly opposite smedleys
mill

  tom stone shouldered his pack and
started on toward town he had gone but
a little way when he came to a cabin that
stood on a hummock of rising ground in
the swamp tom walked up to the pole
fence around the cabin a man stood in
the door watching him as he approached
a rickety wagon with a woebegone team
hitched to it stood near in the wagon
were a handful of crude household goods

  climb over stranger called the man-
i would ast you to come in but im con-
in out

  hows that

  bandonin this old cabin and god for-
saken slice of land

  do vou own the land

  yep

  what did you pay for it

  nothin it was wished on me i
heired it from pap bawn in this here
cabin mister laish taylors my name

  stones mine why dont you sell the
land

  cant be did podner tried to onload
it with the timber but the mill wouldnt
buy nothin but the stumpage goin tods
town 

  tom stone admitted that he was going
toward town thanked mr taylor for the
proffered ride and they got into the wagon
and drove away
long-leaf lands



ld judge bindley
was gray and fat and
jolly- his eyes twin-
kled under his bushy
gray brows and he
shook like a mountain
of jelly when he
laughed which was
often the morning after tom stone was
discharged from the smedley lumber
company judge bindley sat in his dusty
office on the courthouse square fairly
trembling with suppressed laughter he
controled himself for the time but a few
minutes later when he saw a young fellow
in laced boots ride out of town on a hog-
backed plug he fairly roared with laughter
the young man was tom stone mr
stone didnt know judge bindley was
laughing at him if indeed so much man
on so little horse was the cause of the
jurists merriment tom at least was in
no laughing humor

  tom stone dont git mad but once a
year but when he do git mad hell shore
pops an old timber foreman had once
said there was nothing popping audibly
as tom rode his grotesque mount out of
town but he was seething with anger on
the inside he was telling himself that he
owed sam smedley a debt and had the rest
of his life in which to pay it-and he was
good pay he seemed now to be heading
for the smedley mills where he was
known to have been working a mile be-
low town he crossed to the west side of
the neches river and took his way through
the swamps and fallen timber of the cut-
over land at last he reached virgin pine
forest untouched by the hand of man
with the trained eye of an expert cruiser
he viewed the giant pine and cypress trees
as he picked his way through the dense
bottom

t was almost noon
old dad bynum was
sitting on the gallery of
his pine-log cabin wait-
ing for his dinner and
playing with the long
ears of his favorite
hound while he sucked
at a corn-cob pipe dad was a typical
squirrel-hunter his cabin which fronted
east toward the river stood on the point
of a little spit of the sandy uplands that
ran out into the swamps and marshes of
the river bottom

  light stranger and come in called
bynum as a man stopped at the fence

  stones my name tom stone said
the visitor extending a hand as he stepped
up on the gallery

  bynums mine tobe bynum mostly
called dad bynum best rifleshot fox-
hunter and fisherman in the neches bot-
toms take a chair

  fine timber here mr bynum com-
mented tom

  yup fine as they air in neches bot-
toms i split ten thousand two-foot boards
outn one tree in them bottoms about
twenty year ago just twenty year ago i
reckn it were viney was a baby then
seems that such timber should be
valuable

  hit do look like it mr stone but it
wont bring nothin i been dickerin some
with a sharp-nosed web-footed timber
lawyer named nelms he offers two dol-
lars an acre but he only wants to take the
land where the timber is that would
cut me plumb off from fishin and huntin
grounds nothin wont stay on cut-over
lands hits the godfersakenest place in
the whole world sides that hit would
leave me with a lot of sand ridges that
aint no count lessn a feller could live
on chinkapins and sand burrs pretty
rough grub for anything cept a hawg or
something

  yes i should thing it would be smiled
tom you didnt sell i suppose

  no sirree take all or none i says
i druther let it all go at a dollar an acre
than to sell the bottoms at two dollars and
have to keep the rest and pay tax on it
how much is there in the tract
why hits two leagues i heired it
from pap and he got it in a trade away
back yonder pap used to say to me
tobe he says them virtuous pine timber
will be worth a pile of money one of these
days he he he ef hed left me two
leagues of them black prairies out a ways
id dang nigh be a millionaire by this time
but they thought the prairies was no count
in them times yes theys two leagues-
bout nine thousand acres fronts six mile
on the river and runs three mile out into
the ridges never been surveyed fur as

  pap dinners ready

  the voice tinkled like a silver bell in
spite of the piney woods drawl tom stone
whose back was to the cabin door sprang
to his feet and turned facing a young girl
her hair which was the tawny color of
ripe com hung in a thick plait down her
back her eyes were as blue as the sea
while her dress was of faded calico but


frostier stories

nothing could disguise the fact that she

 was pretty

   my darter viney mr stone intro-
 duced bynum

 recovered from his surprise tom stone
 acknowledged the introduction gallantly

   walk in and sit mr stone invited
 viney

  why i-i dont wish to impose-

stammered tom

   aint imposin none if you can put up
 with the fare interrupted dad bynum
 pore folks has pore ways but youre wel-
 come to sech as it is

   they went in and sat down to corn pone
 bacon sour-dock greens young onions and
 clear amber coffee tom was an outdoor
 man and grub that would stick to the ribs
 met his hearty approval

   back on the gallery their pipes going
 tom stones mind turned to that virtu-
 ous pine timber dad bynum was long-
 winded and told things slowly but tom
 wanted to know more

   and the tract has never been surveyed
 he offered to start the old squirrel-shooter
 going

   no it never has been and hit wont
be if i have to pay fer it i told nelms
id take ten thousand dollars for the whole
shebang or i wouldnt do nothin

   he took it didnt he

   nope said hed have to see his prin-
 cipal i just told him he could see his
 principal and his interest too for all i
 keered but that was what id do and that
 was all id do

   did you sign a sale contract

   didnt sign anything and aint goin to
 ontel i get them ten thousand dollars
 the land is worth more than that mr
 bynum

   would you be willin to give more
 yes i certainly would -if i had enough
 money to buy it

   and yes again if i had that much
money i wouldnt sell it im broke and
owin and i dont like to he that way
atter i see nelms if he dont take what
i offered you can talk some more no
matter what you offered now id stick by
what i told nelms

   they smoked out their pipes in silence
 after that then dad bynum rose

   i -aim to take a round in the bottoms
 for squirrels he said young ones is
 just right for stewin now hits a pretty
 long way around the head of that arm of
 the swamp if you aim to go back to town
 but its the only road lessn you knowed
 the bottoms better than what you do

miling at bynums
adroit but unmistakable
dismissal tom stone
mounted hig old plug
and took his way
around the head of the
swamp which extended
back into the sandy
ridge he had come back into the road op-
posite the cabin when viney stepped out
and raised her hand as a signal for him
to stop

  mr stone i-i want to have speech
with you she said hesitantly

  why certainly miss bynum and
tom dismounted wondering what was to

come

  i heared you and pap talking about
the timber land said viney coming to the
business in hand at once youre a timber
man aint you

  yesm

   well i know you aint scoutin for that
sharp-nosed nelms feller cause i heared
you say the land was worth more than
what he offered sides that you look
square and honest

  thank you said tom simply and
waited for her to go on

  now me i aint had no schoolin ner
no chance but i know how big a acre of
ground is i stepped off a acre in them
bottoms and then i counted the trees on
it-just the big ones if one of them trees
is worth a dollar and it shorely ought to
be that acre is worth a hundred and fifty
dollars hit werent the thickest acre i
could find either but just middlin thick
i cant figger much but i got wild-hawg
sense enough to know that them bottoms
is worth a heap more than what pap has
agreed to take for em

  yes thats true replied tom but
the point is that mr bynum has agreed
on the price and he wont break his word
i know pap is that way hes a good
hunter and fisher and a powerful good
man he thinks a man cant go to heaven
onless he keeps his word and maybe he
cant he aint had no more schoolin than
i had and he aint got much more sense
than me keepin yo word is right-ifn
you got sense enough to know what youre

doin when you give it but-

  viney stopped and sat down on a fallen
tree by the roadside elbows on knees and
chin in hands there was a far away
troubled look in her blue eyes stone said
nothing because he didnt know anything
to say after a long minute viney sighed
mr stone i been plumb desprit ever
long-leaf lands

since pap told me what he greed to take
for the land she went on some men
could do a lot with ten thousand dollars
pap couldnt do nothin but spend it-or
let somebody take it away from him its
bad enough to live here in this bottom with
nothin but the cabin a little garden and
a few razor-back hawgs but we have got
that and a place for pap to hunt and fish
if he sells it wont be no time ontel we
wont have even that much when i
beared you talk you sounded like you
had timber sense and like you might be
sorter honest so when you and pap was
gone i just taken out acrost the swamp to
ast you if you couldnt help me some way
i dont see any way i can help tom
admitted reluctantly as i told your
father id give a good deal more for the
land if i had the money but i havent it
-now

 mebbe that big smedley mill acrost the
river would give more

  no nelms is their agent i cruised
every acre of your fathers good timber
land for smedley thats why i know it
is worth more than nelms offered for it
vineys blue eyes went dark and she
half rose from the log on which tom
stone had also seated himself

  then i kinder come to a goats house
for wool she said sharply you belong
to the same gang looks funny youd be
knockin nellums deal dont think much
of keepin yo word and playin square do
you and there was contempt in her tone

  just a minute before you pass judg-
ment miss bynum tom interrupted and
briefly he told this piney woods girl what
had happened at the smedley mill the day
before he went further and told her how
he had fought mosquitoes and taken chan-
ces with malaria in summer and had waded
snow and slush in winter for sam smed-
ley only to be insulted with a command
to steal at the end of that service

  i take it all back tom said viney
frankly so thems the kind of people
that paps so particler to keep his word
with i dont blame you none for wanting
to cut that smedley off from this bynum
bottom i wisht i could help you do it
on yo own account as well as on mine
and paps account

  maybe you can said tom who had
been thinking rapidly

  who me

yes if you have a good deal of nerve
huh i had nerve enough to beat a
alligator to death with a club what had
hold of our best sow by the hind laig i

sholy ought  have enough to chunk that
smedley outfit some when they got pap
and the bynum bottoms by both hind
laigs

  tom smiled at vineys way of putting
the proposition

  is your mother living he asked

  no died when i was twelve

  i see then your father cant give title
to this land unless you join him

 meanin-

  meaning that it was a community
estate and half of it your mothers half
belongs to you all you have to do is to
refuse to sign the deed refuse to sign
anything if they drive you too far em-
ploy a lawyer and sue for a partition of
the estate

  tom said viney rising i dont
know exactly what you mean but youve
helped me some i can understand that i
aint to sign nothin

  viney extended her small brown hand

  thankye tom goodby and with
that she disappeared into the swamp
springing from log to log like some wild
thing

  tom stone stood watching her until the
last flash of her faded calico dress dis-
appeared in the thick bottom then he
mounted his spavined plug and took the
road toward town when he left the byn-
um cabin his hopes lay in ruins about him
this interview with viney had raised them
again true their only support was the
nerve and staying qualities of a girl but
then-viney had beaten an alligator to
death with a club to protect her own a
broad grin spread over toms face as the
old plug splashed on through the swamp

  mentally tom weighed the situation
of course smedley would try to close the
deal for bynums land he knew all about
the millions of feet of fine pine and cypress
timber he had toms figures on it the
same as he had on the holderness land
he knew bynums land was worth at least
a hundred times what he had offered for
it he was a shrewd lumberman and that
one deal would make him a fortune with-
out the bynum forest even if smedley
could steal the holderness stumpage with
the aid of nelms he would have no great
field to work

  tom sighed as he came out into the cut-
over lands near town it looked like-a slim
chance just the will of a slender girl be-
tween him and the failure of a great idea
if he had a little money it would be dif-
ferent when he had paid the livery sta-
ble for the use of the old crow-bait that he


frontier stories

had ridden on that wild goose chase he
would have less than five dollars left fu-
ture events were on the knees of the gods
where he must leave them whether he would
or not

om stone had left
the smedley lumber
company on a monday
afternoon on tues-
day he had visited dad
bynum so rapidly had
events transpired that
b y wednesday morn-
ing tom had thrown his coat on a pile of
slabs at a little sawmill that was slabbing
cross-ties in a belt of hardwood timber a
mile north of town he had a job and was
proceeding to earn his keep while the game
went on old sam smedley president of
the smedley lumber company had been
figuring furiously with a stump of pencil
since it was light enough to see finally
convinced that two and two make four and
also that figures dont lie he turned to an
off-color underling in the office

  is bill boston here he asked

  yes sir hes out in the saw-yard
  tell him to come here

  a few minutes later a two-fisted giant
of a man with the eyes of a pig and the
neck of a bull entered the office

  sit down bill commanded smedley
reckn youd as soon go to town with me
today as to go with yo gang to the bot-
toms

  reckn i would grinned boston
guess you heard that i fired tom
stone hes been getting a hundred and
fifty and youve been getting a hundred
and twenty-five do you want his job as
timber-cruiser at a hundred and seventy-
five a month

  shore i want it

  all right you get it tust take up
where tom left off heres his figgers
on that holdcrness tract you and mell
go to town today i want you to make affi-
davit to these figgers just like they was yo
own theyd be just the same if you
made em

  all right sir said bill he knew he
didnt have the ability to take tom stones
place but it didnt worry him

  before starting to town smedley and
his new cruiser took a turn through the big
yards saws were whining and sawdust
flying everywhere there were cribs and
racks of lumber in every direction and
the stock was growing every day

  ef you dont move some of this lumber

pretty soon grinned bill boston hitll
be like carters oats-youll have to rent
ground to stack it on

  ill move it when the time comes lets
go snapped smedley

  another man had been appointed fore-
man of logging gang no i in bill bost-
ons place as he and smedley walked
away toward the buckboard that was to
take them to town there was a look of joy
in the eyes of the gang for bill boston
had a heavy hand everybody recognized
him as the best man in point of physical
strength and fighting courage in the log-
ging outfit-or anywhere else about the
smedley mills for that matter

  that same afternoon sam smedley sat
in joe nelms office while bill boston was
taking aboard a few drinks after making
the false affidavit as directed

  everythings ready then smedley
summed up you got the right of way
across the cut-over land all tied up

  y-e-s drawled nelms

  got that clause in all the contracts
a-here they agree not to give or sell a right-
of-way to any other road got the land
tied up for a yard at this end of the track

  yes

  fine that puts the bynum timber in
a pocket where itll stay for a thousand
years if he dont trade with me smed-
leys eyes fairly glittered with greed as he
went on ill teach these squirrel-shooters
something about business methods ill
start at once got to build sheds here and
put in a planing mill everythings ready
machinery all ordered ill put a big gang
at work at each end one working out
from here sos the rails can be laid as they
go and another one driving piling and
coming this way from the mill then ill
post a little prize for the gang that gets
to the half-way point first and theyll work
their heads off

  nelms grinned at the lumbermans
shrewdness

  theres just one little cliance for a
hitch and thats the bynum land contin-
ued smedley with that cinched im
settin jake you say you got it cinched
how

  why bynum wont sell half of it and
he wont sell it anyway except for cash
he offers to take ten thousand spot cash
for the whole tract said hed be here
saturday to see what we want to do about
it and hed die before hed break his
word

  but i dont want to buy it right now

 why
long-leaf lands

  well muttered smedley i reckn a
mans lawyer has got to know a right smart
about his business the situation is like
this when me and my brothers broke
up in the hardwood country i had just a
hundred and fifty thousand to my share
and part of that was in land ive sunk
a lot of money here and this narrow-gage
railroad through the swamp will cost a lot
more i got enough lumber already cut to
pay for it if it was on the market but it
aint on the market and wont be until the
roads finished i got to take care of my
payroll and its heavy just now every-
things goin out and nothin cornin in as
the feller said when the bottom bust out
of his barrel

  i see i see

  course you do now ill write you
a check for a thousand dollars you use
that to tie up bynums land until the first
of october by that time ill have lumber
on the market and be in the clear the
banks here might be willin to back me
but i dont ask favors and then i dont
have to grant em you ought to be able
to stall that trade along five months

  all right drawled nelms with his
eyes half closed gimme the check and
ill see what i can do

  smedley wrote the check and started
for the door

  this timber cruiser you got is a new
man aint he nelms ventured

  no been with me two-three year
i thought your cruisers name war
stone

  was but i fired him 

  can you depend on this fellow bos-
ton

  hell do anything i tell him to do
fine i thought stone knew a little
too much to make a real good cruiser

  a glance shot between the two men and
sam smedley went on about his business
well pleased with the situation

he next move in the
game was when dad
bynum clumped into
joe nelms office on
saturday pulling at his
old cob pipe

   w e -seen yo-
principal-an interest
-an things he asked between puffs
yes replied nelms well take the

land at your offer but-

  all right make out the papers an
give me the ten thousand dollars and ill
sign em



  but mr bynum as big a deal as that
cant be handled that way in the first
place well have to have an abstract
what for i heired that land from
pap pap bought it from the riginal
grantee that got it from the mexican gov-
ment it aint passed through no more
hands and hits been in our family moren
fifty year

  that may all be true but we must have
a record of it

  find a record at the cot-house i
reckn

  perhaps so but you dont understand

these things mr bynum now-

  i understand this much im broke
and owin and i don t like to be that way
only for that i wouldnt sell for no price
yvell now listen to me mr bynum
i think i can relieve your situation this
way you make a sale contract with us
agreeing to take ten thousand for the land
and give possession the fifteenth day of
october by that time we can have the
abstract made the title proved up and

everything in good shape and-

  yes an before that time id be sued
and in court where i aint never been and

dont want to be i got to have-

  how much do you owe

  dang night four hundred dollars in-
trust and all

 ah right we can take care of that
you sign a sale contract and ill pay a
housand down that will put you in the
clear and leave you six hundred then on
the fifteenth of october youll get the
ther nine thousand if theres no flaw in
the title and im sure there wont be
with a thousand dollars and freedom
irom owin  in sight dad bynums pur-
pose to sign nothing until he got the ten
thousand dollars weakened

  all right draw up yo paper and lets
took at it

  the lawyers long fingers swept over
the keys of his typewriter presently he
drew two copies of the contract out of the
machine and handed one to dad bynum

  youre representing sam smedley in
this deal aint you bynum asked

  yes replied nelms

  all right i reckn somebody ought to
represent me well take this down to old
judge bindley if he says its all right
you pay me the thousand and ill sign it
together they went to bindleys office
judge i got a job for you bynum
greeted the fat lawyer look at this
paper and tell me if its all right

  judge bindley adjusted his glasses and


frontier stories

read the contract with half closed eyes f
sellin that land pretty low aint you
bynum he growled

  mr bynum only asked you for advice
as to the validity of this contract snarled
nelms

  yes thats all i asked for interposed
dad bynum fact is it aint enough
judge but when you town fellers voted
them cout-house an jail bonds onto us
pore land-owuers you riz taxes ontel it
ruint us i got behind and im broke and

owin and-

  im in a hurry fidgeted nelms the
point is do you consider the contract valid
judge bindley

  are you satisfied with it asked the
old judge slowly veiling his thoughtful
eyes with heavy lids

  i will be when mr bynum affixes his
signature

  all right he ought to be satisfied
ill pass it

  good just sign here mr bynum and
ill sign for the lumber company

  wait a minute whined dad wheres
the money

  heres mr smedleys check ill en-
dorse it to you

  never min just bring the check and
the contract over to the bank gimme the
money and ill sign i can count money
right peart but i never could do much
countin checks ill come back and pay
you when i get the money judge

  thats all right tobe just bring me
a mess of young squirrels the next time
you come to town chuckled the judge

   shore do that had a mess stewed
the other day theyre just prime
when bynum and nelms were gone
judge bindley leaned back in his chair

  if tobe bynum had twice as much
sense as hes got hed be almost as smart
as a woodchuck he muttered to himself
if joe nelms had half as much sense as
he thinks hes got hed be the smartest
lawyer that ever was in texas

  then he took his pipe out of his mouth
and chuckled for five minutes after that
he took out his handkerchief wiped away
the tears of laughter and spreading it over
his face to keep the flies away went to
sleep thus was consummated the sale of
the wonderful long-leaf lands of the byn-
um bottoms where tom stone had vainly
hoped one day to hear the whine of his
own saw

  when dad bynum drove out of town
that evening he was happy he wasnt
broke and owin in his rattley old

wagon there was a keg of syrup bags of
flour coffee canned fruits and a liberal
stock of other supplies wrapped in an
old quilt was a bright new shotgun against
the coming of ducks in the fall in a big
bundle were nine gaudy calico dress pat-
terns two pairs of shoes and other items
for viney in a round bandbox beside
him on the seat was a hat trimmed with
flaming poppies a pair of cotton gloves a
feather fan and a silver tucking comb
trust dad to remember a good girl like
viney and to see that she got her share
of their prosperity

hat night after viney
had put the other things
away and had shoved
the box of finery under
her bed she went out
and sat on the gallery
in the moonlight she
had hoped for much
from tom stone but he had failed her
he had been mistaken and pap had sold
the land anyway she wished she could
see tom and talk to him about it all any-
way she had kept her promise she hadnt
signed anything true she hadnt been
asked to sign anything but she wouldnt
have if she had been asked shed made
a promise to tom stone far into the
night she sat pondering her problem and
wondering if shed ever see tom again

  the next day being sunday tom felt
that since he had a job he could afford to
pay a dollar for the old plug and take an-
other ride there was a strange attraction
for him in that virtuous pine forest of
dad bynums he wanted to go again and
look at it to hear the wind moan in its
branches he had no idea that it had al-
ready been sold

  well mr stone i told you if nelms
didnt take up my offer id dicker with you
about the land and i guess you come for
that bynum greeted him on the gallery
in front of the cabin facts is nelms
took me up

  there was a look of pained surprise
shot with flashes of anger on toms face
that dad didnt fail to notice

  that aint no reason why you and me

shouldnt be friendly-

  dinners ready pap a weary voice
said as he was about to go on

  tom greeted viney warmly and they
went in to dinner there was no corn
pone and sour-dock today no such vul-
gar dishes as that but food for gods
there were biscuits light and brown a
long-leaf lands	

 i just felt like i couldnt abide it here
 alone come in the house and let me show

great stack of russet fried chicken flanked
bv a bowl of cream gravy then there
was a generous dewberry pie while oc-
cupying the center of the rickety old table
was a blue bowl filled with canned apri-
cots not to mention other delicacies

  after doing full justice to the wonderful
dinner tom and old dad smoked on the
gallery and bynum discoursed on fishing
tackle while viney cleared away the dishes
finally she came out and sat silently list-
ening to the conversation at last dad
rose and refilled his pipe

  i seen some bees watering in a holler
stump the yuther day he said think
ill just prowl down the bottom and see
kin i locate it again

  with no further word he walked away
and left tom and viney sitting on the
gallery it was some minutes before the
silence between them was broken

  i reckn you see paps made a raise
viney said then in a halting sort of voice

  yes he told me he had sold the land
and there was a tiny note of accusation
in toms voice

  i didnt sign nothin tom denied
viney before she had been accused i
was plumb broken up when pap come
home last night and told me he had sold
he jes signed some kind of contract and
got a thousand dollars down the rest to be
paid in october when he makes the deeds
and gives up the land

  oh is that it there was hope in
toms tone

  yes thats the way it is tom but it
wont be no different papll soon squan-
der it all nobody dont understand what
it means to- me ive stayed here year
after year ive wore laced shoes that
werent even rights and lefts when i
knowed other women had shoes that but-
toned on the side-hopin that some day
a white man would put a mill in the big
bottom and pay pap what the trees was
worth sos i could have things and mebbe
be somebody b-but-flow the lands

sold and-and-

  viney stopped on a choking note and
looked off toward the emerald sea of wav-
ing pines there was such a tightness in
toms throat when he saw her brush away
a tear that it was a minute before he could
speak

  oh well i wouldnt worry miss
viney he comforted her youll get half

of the money and-

  dont mind me tom i feel better
since i told somebody and cried a little
about it im shore glad you come today

you what pap brung me from town

  the nine gaudy dress-patterns were laid
on the table then the gorgeous hat the
gloves and the feather fan came out of
the round box

  i think itll look right purty when i
get my hair did up and all said viney
her eyes still shining with tears mebbe
i could just quile it and suiting the action
to the word she coiled the great plait at
the back of her shapely head fastened it
with the silver tucking-comb and put on
the hat

uddenly the poppies
had lost their gaudy
tints there were rus-
set leaves on the hat to
match her hair and
sprays of tiny forget-
me-nots to match her
eyes then she caught
a look on tom stones face and the roses
in her cheeks put the poppies to open
shame it was only a fleeting moment

  its right handy tom to have plenty
in the house and not have to make a meals
vittles outn scraps viney went on in
matter-of-fact tones without removing the
hat paps awful good to me tom but
this wont last hell get them other nine
thousand and hitll go the same way this
has gone still and all i cant-i cant-
tears began to well in her eyes again but
she wiped them away and went on i
promised you i wouldnt sign nothin
tom and i aint but- i dont make many
promises and i low to keep most of em
but- tom when pap asks me to sign
them deeds i cant refuse him hes give
his word and give it square and honest
i know he aint never thought about half
of the land bein mine like you said hes
old hes allers kept his word and hit
would nigh about kill him to break it now
i want that you should let me off from that
promise i made about signin papers i-
i-

  viney dropped the feather fan that she
had held in her hand into the box with the
cotton gloves and wiped her eyes the
very poppies on the hat seemed to droop
in sympathy for her misery

  why miss viney you didnt make me
any promise particularly tom protested
you just said you wouldnt sign the
papers anyway if you had promised me
id release you from any promise you made
me that was making you unhappy


frontier stories

  thank you tom and there was relief
in viney s lone let me offm thisn and
you wont never have to let me off again
i wont never make you another promise
that i dont aim to keep-always

  toms heart skipped a beat but there
was no sign of coquetry in vineys teary
eyes nothing but straightforward inno-
cence

  get your horse and ill show you the
way to cross the swamp thout going so
far around she said when tom rose to
leave a little later then when you come
again you can get here a little sooner and
stay a little longer

  she still wore her hat as they walked
together down the trail tom leading his
horse she showed him where the trail
entered the swamp at the sweet gum tree
she showed him the blazes to follow and
the black bog under the leaning sycamore
that he must keep away from because it
had no bottom finally she brought him
out into the road on the other side of the
swamp under the big black walnut tree
then she extended her hand

  goodby tom she said come back
when you kin ill shore be glad to see
you

  as the old plug splashed through the
marshy bottom tom stone summed up
the situation the wonderful long-leaf
lands from which he had hoped so much
were now out of his reach smedley had
his filthy tentacles on a fortune there but
there was something else on the bynum
tract that i oin had decided was well worth
having besides virtuous pine timber
a warm comfortable feeling came to him
at thought of viney and the sacrifice she
was willing to make in order to save her
father from breaking his word

  then toms face flamed and his eyes
flashed with rage at the thought of sam
smedley robbing these innocent people
he thought how grateful viney had been
for that cheap tawdry hat and those calico
dresses and of the thousands of times
their value smedley and his hatchet-faced
lawyer were robbing her of suddenly he
stopped the old plug and shook his ham-
like fist at the heavens

  damn a man that will rob a woman
he roared

  this seemed to relieve him at least
he rode on thoughtfully across the cut-over
land and into town

  that was by no means toms last visit
to the bynum cabin outstanding among
other visits was the saturday night that he
and dad bynum spent togetlier on the

bayou when they put out set lines then
sat by the camp-fire smoking and talking
of many things at daylight they had
taken a forty-pound cat off one of the
looks and carried it to the cabin viney
ried a great dish of the white meat and
they feasted afterward tom and dad
spent most of that sunday morning walk-
ing in the wonderful bynum bottoms
tom explained how a timber-cruiser esti-
mated the value of a forest they stopped
under a giant cypress tree and after a mo-
ments calculation he told dad there was
three hundred dollars worth of lumber
in that one tree

  i shore sold this land a lot too low
tom accordin to yo tell and i dont
doubt it none the old man said if i
could a talked to you a little sooner it
might been different but hit air too late
now i done give my word

  that was when tom gave up all hope
of thwarting smedley in his steal of the
bynum lands

  an honest man may be the noblest
work of god but i dont see why he made
the honestest ones the damnedest fools
he muttered to himself as he rode home
that night

n the following mon-
day morning surveyors
began running the line
for the narrow gauge
road to smedleys mill
it was done in two
days and two gangs be-
gan work one at the
town and the other at the mill smedley
had hung up a prize of five hundred dol-
lars for the gang that reached the half-
way point first the surveyors ran the
line straight and in doing so ran within
fifty feet of laish taylors old cabin on
the bandoned land by chance the half-
way stake was right in front of the cabin
door

  bill boston was promoted again and put
in charge of construction work beginning
at the mill a mile would cover all the
grading on the route the rest and partic-
ularly on bills end was trestles through
the swamp steadily the two ends of the
road drew together through the long hot
summer months while the water was low
work at the smedley mill neer slackened
millions of feet from the holderness tract
were being sawed and stacked against the
opening of the road	f

  the first of august saw smedley s
money gone but he was in high feather
long-leaf lands

he borrowed fifty thousand dollars and
gave a blanket mortgage on his holdings
that he felt was not asking a favor it
was giving some idle money a job for the
collateral was worth ten times that much
he had nothing to worry about now
nothing to do but work and wait for the
harvest

  the big yards at the railroad were fin-
ished and the sign -smedley lumber
company was on roof and sides in let-
ters four feet long the planing mill was
finished and the new machinery installed
sam smedley was a keen business man
and he knew lumber from the stump to
market he was leaving nothing undone
in the yards at his mill were carloads of
the clear hard pine flooring that the whole
world was begging for he had advance
orders for all the lumber he could ship in
three months with the best of luck noth-
ing could stop him now

  came mid-september and cooler morn-
ings just a month now until every gap
would be closed the bynum tract would
be definitely the property of sam smedley
which assured timber of the finest for the
mills another week now at most and a
stream of lumber would be pouring over
the narrow-gauge road all in plenty of
time to take care of sam smedleys finan-
cial obligations

  the surveyors and construction gangs
had named laish taylors old cabin
swamp eagle and had dubbed it divis-
ion headquarters one evening bill bos-
ton whose gang was in the lead for the
prize money had his men throw some
tools and odds and ends into the cabin

  three more days and a little extra
work he cheered his weary men and
well win that five hundred

  bostons end of the trestle was then
within three hundred yards of the stake at
the cabin door while the other gang was
about half a mile away the next morn-
ing boston with some of his men went
to the cabin to get their tools as they ap-
proached the place they saw a thin spiral
of smoke issuing from the stick-and-dirt
chimney they also saw their tools and
other things in a ragged heap on the
ground outside standing in the door
the stem of his pipe clenched in his strong
even teeth stood tom stone

  what the hell are you doin here de-
manded boston

  i live here

  oh you do well what dye mean
throwin my tools around thataway

  what do you mean putting a lot of

junk in my house without permission
now see here stone a jokes all
right sometimes but we aint got no time
for jokes right now we got to bring our
end of the line up to that stake first in
order to win them five hundred dollars

prize money and-

  then youll never win it

  hell we wont why not

  because this land belongs to me and
i wont permit it your last piling is
within ten feet of my line dont drive
any more

   hen bill boston lost his head and said
things that he wished many times after-
ward he had not said finally in his rage
at the prospect of losing the prize he used
a fighting word fully intending to back it
-and back it he did

  in front of the old cabin was a little plot
of bermuda grass this became a battle
ground for two giants bill boston the
larger and stronger man went in a flame
with rage tom stone went in calmly on
the defensive and coolly alert for every
advantage he hadnt expected to fight
with boston whom he knew to be the
champion scrapper of the mills he had
thought the big foreman would listen to
reason he had no quarrel with boston
sam smedley was the man he was after

  boston was the aggressor from the start
of the fight back and forth they fought
across the plot of grass once boston
struck tom a staggering blow causing him
to reel backward a step his foot struck
the half-way stake and he fell his length
on the ground boston sprang forward
to jump in toms face with his boots but
two of his men caught him and told him he
had to fight fair

  thank you boys said tom getting to
his feet one eye half-closed and blood
dripping from his face

  from that on the fight was an attempt
to murder with bare fists weary and
panting the men fought on each growing
weaker it had begun to look like any-
bodys fight and if there had been betting
at the ringside there would have been no
odds in the midst of the dogged battling
when blows were coming slower and with
less force it occurred to tom that after
ail bill boston represented sam smedley
the mill owner had hired this man to do
his dirty work a surge of berserker rage
came up in toms throat his muscles
tensed again boston made a wild swing
at him and in that instant some terrific
force came up under bostons chin his
head snapped ack he measured his length


frontier stories

on the ground and lay quite still

  half an hour later bill boston sat up
on the grass and stared about him tom
stone was sitting in the cabin door bathing
his swollen face and hands in a bucket of
salt water the other men having revived
bill boston were standing by and looking
on ready for the next round

  do you want any more asked tom
through swollen lips

  hell no im whipped bill tried to
grin

  glad youve got sense enough to know
it thats one fight you could have got
along better without now take your
men and your tools get off my land and
stay off

   ill do that but you better get off too
growled boston old sam smedley aint
apt to take what ive took

  hes apt to take a whole lot worse if
he tries to build a railroad across my
land

  the construction gang took their tools
and departed when they reached the end
of their work they saw where tom had set
up a row of blazed stakes showing his line
doggedly they stacked their tools and
trudged off toward smedleys mills tom
went on bathing his bruises he expected
to have sam smedley on him within a few
hours but the day passed night came on
and still no one came from the mill in
the distance tom could see the other con-
struction gang pushing forward with their
work

  tom stone was not to be deceived by
this inactivity on smedleys part he knew
the mill-owner too well and he also knew
the vindictive spirit of bill boston bills
vanity could never survive the beating
he had taken unless he could in some way
make reprisal so a little while after dark
tom left the cabin and took refuge in a
thicket of alders that grew about fifty
yards north of the house here he
crouched and waited it had not occurred
to him to arm himself other than with his
two mighty fists but as he sat there wait-
ing developments he regretted that he had
not done so

  it was near midnight when tom saw
two bulky forms appearing almost too big
for men approaching from the opposite
direction they disappeared into the
shadow of the cabin moving noiselessly
a little later a match flared and in its red
glare stone recognized the battered face
of bill boston who held the match in his
hand and by the side of it the baggy jowls
of sam smedley boston stooped and

placed the lighted match then the two men
turned and walked rapidly away back to-
ward smedleys mill

   houghtlesslv fom sprang forward to
put out the fire and save the cabin just as
his foot struck into the pile of rich pine
that the two men had stacked against the
door and that had made them look so
bulk to tom a gun cracked a bullet
fanned by toms face and bedded itself
in the logs of the cabin the splinters
scattered and the blaze went out just as
two more bullets spattered against the wall
tom crouched to the ground and again
bullets whined over his head after that
he could hear the two men walking hur-
riedly away

  the months of suppressed rage at sam
smedley now flared to frenzy in tom
stones heart hell was really beginning
to pop as the old timber foreman had said
it would when tom got mad

ld judge bindley
had a habit of going to
his office very early in
the morning and after-
ward going back home
to his breakfast the
judge had just entered
his office when tom
stone came in

  good m awn in tom drawled the
judge why what the-

  tom sank into a chair by the battered
old table and told the judge of his fight
with bill boston

   id a give fifty dollars pore as i am
to have seen that fight-if the other fellow
looks any worse than you do ho ho
ho roared judge bindley

  then when tom told him of the later
outrage the judge didnt laugh

  why tom thats plumb serious he
said gravely arson and assault to mur-
der thats what it amounts to

  itll amount to more than that snap-
ped tom damn sam smedley he cant
put that kind of stuff over me im going
to get me a gun as soon as the stores open
and-

  just a minit tom the judge inter-
rupted sit still and cool some while i
talk a little first off i want to tell you
that the smartest man in the world is a
damn fool when hes mad sam smedley
has showed that right plain and if you
wasnt as crazy mad as he is youd see it
you just keep quiet and it wont be long
until smedley will see what hes done and
come making offers
long-leaf lands

  i dont want his offers damn him if
he wants to shoot it out ill accommodate
him

  just a minit tom soothed the judge
that evening when yon and laish taylor
came in here and you got me to write that
deedt and then when it was signed you
asked me to put it in my safe and keep it
until you called for it i took a right smart
likin to you then when laish was gone
and you told me about the dirty deal sam
smedley had given you told me you just
had six dollars left in the world after you
had paid laish three hundred for the land
told me the reason you didnt have no more
saved was because you been sending money
to yo old folks told me finally that you
was goin to whip hell out of sam smedley
at his own game just with yo two bare
hands why i just naturally fell for you
thats all

  tom began swallowing his wrath at this
and judge bindleys recital warmed him
to the old fellow

  now tom considering everything
youve done right well but all you have
done can be undone in about one little
minute just let you get a gun then
meet sam smedley who always carries
one and who is also right riled just now
smedley kills you and then wheres your
whipping you gave him you kill smed-
ley and what chance you got to punish
him the devil may be singeing him
but it wont give you much satisfaction
even if you dont get hung or sent to the
pen give smedley a chance and hell do
what-

  i tell you i dont want anything from
him flared tom again this is a fight
to a finish he started it and im going
to finish it my own way

  i know i know but listen tom if
you dont get killed in this mess you got
a long time to live and youd like to be
happy a young fellow like you ought to
have a home and things thataway now
you come on over to the house with me
eat some breakfast then let old aunt lucy
make a poultice of fresh beef and mederia
leaves for them eyes of yon she knows
how to do it shes made many a one for
me when i was a youngster then you
lie down and sleep a while you aint
slept a wink since god-knows-when come
on lets go son

  sullenly tom rose and followed the old
judge out the back door across the alley
and on to the rambling old house that
fronted on the next street

bout the time tom
with his eyes poulticed
was dropping off to
sleep a conference was
being held in the office
of joe nelms there
was no laughter and no
philosophy about that
discussion

  i thought you told me you had that
right-of-way all cinched stormed smed-
ley

  i told you about that strip of aban-
doned land replied nelms there was
nothing that could be done about it i
couldnt locate taylor and all i could learn
was that he said he was abandoning it
i have an idea this fellow just squatted on
it thinking abandoned land could be pre-
empted as it can in some states or that he
could plead squatter-rights all he wants
is a few hundred dollars hunt him up
and reason with him

  reason hell you cant reason with
him no way except with a shotgun loaded
with dynamite tom stone aint the dang
fool you think he is unless hes gone crazy
since he quit me and this dont look like it
lets go over to the clerks office and look
up the records on that land so well know
where were at

  five minutes later joe nelms stood
gasping in the clerks office on the day
before there had been recorded a deed
from laish taylor to tom stone the
deed bore date of may  last and set
forth that it conveyed to the said tom
stone a certain parcel of land four hun-
dred and eighty varas wide and two miles
long

  what do ou mean by not recording
this deed sooner snapped joe nelms

  the clerks eyebrows rose in surprise
as he looked over his glasses at the lawyer

  why mr nelms the deed was filed
for record three days ago as the records
show he said there is no law in texas
requiring deeds to be recorded didnt
you know that

  youve played hell nelms roared
smedley

  i tell you it dont amount to anything
insisted nelms all you have to do is
to see stone and pay him what you have to
for the right-of-way across his land
thats all i have to do eh well thats
going to be a plenty

  i reckon hes human offered nelms
yes thats the worst trouble hes too
damned human lets get out of here
where we can talk sense
frontier stories

  out in the court-house yard smedley
stood pawing the red sand with his feet
like an enraged bull

  what i need now is a lawyer instead
of a damned jack-in-the-box he bellowed
at nelms you aint got sense enough to
pack water to a crippled jackass

  that may be true said nelms com-
placently bur ive done considerable work
for you that few other lawyers would have
done in this connection i want to call
your attention to the fact that the bynum
sales contract matures october fifteenth
and you must pay nine thousand dollars at
that time or lose the thousand youve al-
ready paid also on october tenth there
is another thousand due on the holderness

stumpage and that must be paid or-

  oh go-to-hell roared smedley
stand there and tell me things i already
know instead of doing something to save
me from absolute ruin theres a mort-
gage on my plant and stock of lumber for
fifty thousand dollars and its due october
fifteenth too not only that but money
is tight as the hinges of hell and the bank
has already notified me that they wont
extend the note show me a way to get
my road across that four hundred and
eighty varas of land and ill put enough
lumber here in a week to pay everything
i told you one way see stone and pay
him what he wants another way would
be to go right ahead and build your road
then let him sue for damages that would

really be-

  you havent seen bill boston have
you 

  not lately why

you ought to take a look at him then
youd get an idea what the man would
look like who undertook to go right ahead
and build that road across stones land
i told you- began nelms

  yes and i told you to go to hell im
going to hunt up a lawyer thats got some
sense

 stone ate his
e a k f a s t and sub-
ted to aunt lucys
iltice when he had
le to sleep judge
idley went back to
office there was
laughter in the old
fellows eyes now he was confronted
with a serious problem he had only
staved off the promised tragedy tempor-
arily tom stones anger was deep and
relentless  the judge wondered that the

young fellow could harbor such a frightful
grudge against smedley just on account
of the crooked lumberman ordering him to
steal tom s was a rage that might sleep
while he slept but it would flare up again
as soon as he woke in his present state
of mind nothing but smedleys life would
satisfy him

  on the other hand smedley greedy to
the last extreme had almost had his hands
on a cold million and now he faced utter
ruin at tom stones hands if die two
men met one of them would be killed-
perhaps both of them there would be no
thought of compromise in toms mind
even if smedley came begging for it
nothing short of the utter crushing of
smedleys business even if he didnt take
the lumbermans life would ever satisfy
tom how to keep the men apart until
they cooled a little was the problem or
rather until smedley cooled-tom stone
never would

  the old judge was pondering these
things when sam sinedley stepped into his
office

  judge i need a good lawyer he said
without other greeting

  yes been needing one some time
aint you mr smedley

  yes but i didnt know it tom stone
has got my railroad tied up and i want to
employ you to get the matter settled
sorry but im counsel for the other
side of that controversy

  what other side

  why the other side theres always
two sides to a controversy

  ill pay you to represent me

  mr stone will pay me to represent
him

  whats he got to pay with whats
he got at stake anyway

  why everything hes got is at stake
same as everything you got is at stake
his all is the same to him as yo all is to
you

  oh hell i havent got time to listen
to such damned nonsense as that ill
give you five thousand dollars to settle
this mess with your client and let me go
on with my road

  and i wouldnt suggest it to him for
five million besides that he wouldnt
settle your way for five billions toms
sorter mad at you mr smedley

  oh dammit talk sense

  fine i been waiting for you to ask
me to do that just sit still and behave
yourself i think im in a position to do
you more good than any other lawyer on
long-leaf lands

earth could do you and still do no violence
to my own client

  well get to business snapped smed-
ley i cant wait all day

  all right in the first place i want
you to get two things fixed in your mind
one is that im going to tell you the truth
even if it bleeds the other is that all the
money you got and all you think youre
going to get dont make you look like no
booger to me

  smedley swallowed hard but he man-
aged to hold his tongue

  now then continued the judge
heres the statement of facts that you and
me have got to take as a basis for what-
ever we do us squirrel-hunters are
pretty good plain honest mill-run folks
we quarrel some among ourselves but
when an outsider jumps on one of us he
jumps on all of us youve jumped on
several-pretty hard in the first place
you and that jack-leg lawyer that you sent
on ahead of you to smell things out robbed
poor frank thompson out of his sawmill
in the next place you made a dishonorable
and dishonest proposal to the best timber-
cruiser in texas and he quit you just as
any other white man would have done
in the next place you brought a logging
foreman to town said he was a timber-
cruiser and had him swear a lie in making
an affidavit to falsified figures on the hold-
erness stumpage then-

  ill be damned if i stand for any more
of that roared smedley springing to his
feet

  theres just one more item you better
hear it it might save you a lot of trouble
and it doesnt cost you a cent

  go ahead growled smedley resuming
his seat

  last night you and bill boston went to
tom stones home and tried to set fire to
his house then when he went to put it
out you fired several shots at him that
constitutes assault to murder and arson

a pretty grave-

 i deny-

  it wont do no good to deny it tom
was within fifty yards of you and saw you
and bill both when the match was struck
besides that theres a man at the cabin
now keeping things in statu quo more
than that a man has just come back from
there and he says yon and bill bostons
tracks are plumb plain in the soft ground
at the edge of the bermuda grass where
you stopped to do the shooting couldnt
mistake them tracks bill boston has got
the biggest human foot in the neches bot-

tom and not many grown men have got as
small feet as you have thats all now
then maybe i can tell you how to settle it
i lost my head judge said smedley
ill admit that but who wouldnt have
lost his head a million dollars in sight
and have that fellow block the game that
way and try to ruin me ive worked like

a slave on this proposition and-

  yes youve worked pretty hard if
youd come in here and bought an interest
with frank thompson and furnished
frank some business brains thered have
been a fortune in it for both of you run
square and right but you didnt do that
i can see ive been a fool judge and
im willing to pay for my folly tell me
what to do if all these charges are
pressed against me now ill be ruined
oh youll be ruined anyway if losing
everything youve got will ruin you tom
stone set out to ruin you you took a few
shots at tom last night when he was un-
armed first sight he has of you hes go-
ing to pay them shots back and he aint
going to wait for you to begin you cant
blame him dont but four people know
about the arson and attempt to murder
besides you and bill boston i dont
reckn either of you is apt to talk and ill
manage to keep the others quiet for the
present if you do what i advise of

gins to investigate thats something else

manded smedley white to the lips

  why its this ill give you fifty thou-
sand dollars for all your holdings in this
county and ill pay the fifty thousand to
the lumbermens national bank and take

up your note that-

  like hell you will all youd have to
do would be to build four hundred and
eighty varas of road and youd have a
hundred thousand dollars worth of lumber
on the market

  yes thats true too but that lumber
is worth just exactly four-bits on the other
side of that swamp and you cant build
that four hundred and eighty varas of road
in four hundred and eighty years because
tom stone is going to kill you if you try
it-and hell come clear if he kills you
sweating from every pore smedley
crouched in his chair his greedy soul in
torment

call to expect him to be human in dealing


frontier stories

with you anyway was you human when
you broke poor frank thompson one of
the best men god ever made was you
human when you stole the stumpage off
the holderness land was you human

lawyer of yon tried to steal two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars worth of timber
from poor ignorant old tobe bynum and
his orphan daughter was you ever hu-
man ive made my talk its up to you
and a wasted minute may mean your life
for tom stone is going to hunt for you
but ill be broke ruined 

  yes but youll be alive if you hurry
if i was in your place id sign that deed
and then id get out of texas as quick
as a train traveled through here also
if you think anything of joe nelms youll
advise him to go with you

t was almost sunset
when judge bindley
wobbled across the alley
to his home tom
stone had just awak-
ened and was out on the
long gallery at the side
of the house splashing
cold water over his face and neck the
judge sat dowrn in a chair

  aunt lucy bring me a toddy and make
it stiff he called

  he drank the toddy slowly when it
came and then set the glass on the win-
dow ledge

  come here tom and sit down he
commanded then when tom stone was
by his side he went on ive played poker
some and ive bluffed a little but this has
been the hardest day of my life-i think
i won the pot but i was scared to death
all the time

  have you seen anything of sam smed-
ley  and rage flamed in toms eyes again

  yes i saw him and i dont reckn ill
ever see him again he left on the train
about an hour ago read them and he
handed tom a package of papers chief
among which was a deed from sam smed-
ley to the stone-thompson lumber com-
pany to all his holdings in that county

  but said tom when at last he un-
derstood what had happened and that
smedley was completely crushed where
do you come in on this

  oh ive been right mercenary-for
me ill collect ten thousand dollars that
i loaned frank thompson on a plain note
of hand and that he never could have paid

if it hadnt been for this

  then judge bindley began to laugh for
the first time since that morning

  tom said he between gales of
laughter he was the worst skeered man
ive seen since  tried old doc mcwhort-
ers nigger mage for stealing a gourdful
of soft soap then he grew serious
but now tom the funs all over and
you and frank thompson have got to
work like hell or well all be ruined i
aint got no fifty thousand to pay that note
on the fifteenth of october if it aint
paid the bank will foreclose on the whole
works and take it away from you you
got to slam up that gap in the road and get
that lumber moving i guess old tobe
bynum has had more fun out of this little
mess than anybody else hes had one hell
of a spree of spending on that thousand
dollars even if the contract wasnt worth
the paper it was written on i was to see
tobe the other day we went squirrel
hunting he spotted me three and beat
me five

  i dont know how im ever going to
thank you for this judge said tom if
it hadnt been for you id have had sam
smedleys blood on my hands by this time
and i dont want my hands bloody
no i reckn not you dont owe me
no thanks you worked four-five months
and done all the rough stuff i just worked
one day but theres one little thing id
like to say to you frank thompson
knows all about machinery and is a first
class mill-man but he aint got no business
sense thats why i put you at the head of
the firm when i organized it theres only

one trouble-

  whats that judge

  why being an old bachelor myself
ive come to the conclusion they aint
worth a damn for anything-hardly let
alone the head of a big lumber company
tom stone grinned until he cracked his
sore lip

  would saturday be soon enough he
asked

  shore

toms and can make the best squirrel stew

a cupid in sea boots

 by james k waterman

  author of the sea fox returns breachin bill etc

 a grand battle it was that capn bob heldare jumped into when he stepped
 up ter uphold the dignity of sperm whalers-a battle that was to have signifi-
 cance far beyond any of his roaring career

ith his hat perched
precariously over his
starboard ear the gristly
old mate of the whaling
bark stormy petrel
lurched unsteadily out
of the flying flukes
saloon about eight-
thirty on a wednesday night he stood
on the sidewalk of the main street of
jamestown island of st helena cursing
fervently under his breath and contemplat-
ing his bruised knuckles by the glowing
light of the south atlantic moon

  what the devils up now sam hock-
er inquired a familiar voice at his elbow
swinging around the mate found himself
looking into the keen hazel eyes of a de-
termined looking man about thirty as
straight as a lance and possessing a pair
of noticeably wide shoulders that prom-
ised physical power and endurance unusual
even for a new bedford whaling skipper

  a pleased grunt issued from the lean
throat of mr hocker as he recognized his
skipper capn bob heldare who as ill-
luck would have it happened to be passing
the mates weather-faded blue eyes bright-
ened

  scud me under a marlinspike cap-
pen lie exploded if ye aint come along
jest at the right time thars a sky-scrap-
in son of a dogfish in that- he jerked a
thumb at the saloon door-that tried to

ride me down like a main tack an bust
me ef he didnt come mighty nigh doin
it too

  he paused and holding his battered
hands before his face surveyed them rue-
fully capn bob well aware of his mates
belligerent inclinations when he had a few
horns under his belt regarded him with a
tolerant smile

  my flippers went to pieces agin that
cast-iron phiz o hisn supplemented the
mate ef my hands had beeirs good as
they was when me an you was afore the
mast together an we useter fight jest for
the fun o it id a-trimmed that thar sculp-
ins sheets to the queens taste i would
so cappen

  i should think mr hocker capn
bob admonished with assumed severity
that before you go looking for trouble
youd remember that your hands wont
stand the gaff like they did in those days
but what started you anyhow

  with an aggrieved look mr hocker
avowed that he hadnt been looking for
trouble no indeed far from it he
had merely drifted into the flying flukes
to have a quiet drink when his eyes had
happened to fall on a shaggy sea-bear of a
man whose feet were encased in a pair of
the thickest and largest sea boots he had
ever seen in all his bora days wearing
them in the tropics too mind you the
mate must have shown his surprise for the
frontier stories

 

wearer of thse tremendous footgear im-
mediately shot out the assertion tliat sperm
whalemen werent worth a damn the
tropic sun dried all the guts out of them
after a few voyages thereby rendering
them unfit for anything but mild home
duty such as spearing eels or digging
clams

  an blow trip fer a grampus stormed
the mate seein as how the cuss was look-
in at me when h said it like a sailor would
at a marine caught stealin his tobacker i
felt duty bound dye see cappen to show
my colors so i sailed inter him like a
baltimore clipper a-goin large but it
didnt take me more a leetle less than a
minnit to diskiver that id boarded a craft
that was all fists from clew to earrin so
i has to sheer off like a wounded porpoise
the customers all a-laffin an him a-holl-
erin arter me to bring on some more o my
sun-stewed sparm whalers aint that a
hell of a note cappen

  ever a man of quick impulses and de-
termined resolution the look of mild inter-
est in capn bob heldares eyes changed
gradually until by the time the mate had
finished they were snapping like sparks
from glowing iron

  h-mm so thats the way of it eh
snorted the skipper and he wore big
grain-leather sea boots did he must be
one of them south-of-the-horn sealers or
an arctic bowheader homeward bound
they think theyre a notch  two better
than sperm whalers by all accounts he
paused and stepped one side as two rollick-
ing boatsteerers came along each towing a
pretty giggling yamstock girl and stood
snapping the ball of his thumb over the
forefinger until they passed his brows
knitted into a black frown finally he
nodded with the air of a man who has
made up his mind to right a wrong

  come in and show me this man sam
he said in a tone of deadly calmness

s capn bob hel-
dare and his mate
strode into the bar-
room well lighted by
hanging lamps a whale-
man seated at one of
the tables near the door
took one amazed look
at the skipper and hastily gulping down
his drink rose to his feet

  hells riz now zack he leaned over
the table and whispered to his companion
thars that mate agin an damme ef he
aint brung capn heldare back with him

that hurricane cuss ye remember that lie i
the heavyweight champion of the whalin
heet to a forty round draw one fourth o
july the fiercest an bloodiest battle new
bedford ever see the papers said shake
a leg an lets blow this aint goin to be
no place for a parsons son and with
one apprehensive backward glance they
scuttled through the door

  the flurry among the dozen or so pat-
rons resulting from mr hockers brief
encounter with the unknown had died
down and they were seated at their respec-
tive tables sipping drinks and chatting
when of a sudden they too caught sight of
the mate and his tall rangy companion
words died suddenly on their lips and
awed expectancy was depicted on their
faces as they glanced first at the mate and
then at the unknown leaning against the
bar the latter a man about forty was
in all truth a regular bear of a man and
capn bob as he ranged up alongside with
his six feet of height and two hundred of
weight looked small in comparison

  however a man with heavy white mus-
taches and an unmistakable military bear-
ing a surgeon-major in mufti belonging to
the english regiment stationed on the
island studying the two men carefully de-
cided that the bigger man was muscle-
bound

  capn bob at a nudge from his mate and
a whispered thats him gave the un-
known a swift appraising glance he note l
that his clothes were of the best pilot cloth
the trousers of which an unusual tiling for
that climate were tucked into the tops of
the largest and heaviest sea boots capn
bobs eyes had ever rested on

  nodding familiarly to the bartender the
skipper called for a bottle of beer split
as the drinks were served the unknown
twirled his glass of rum and lime-juice be-
tween a carroty thumb and forefinger and
turning disclosed to capn bob a broad
weather-beaten visage the lower part of
which was shrouded in a heavy black
beard his eyes blue and cold as the jan-
uary ice on the north side of a pond bored
into the skippers for a long moment and
shifting over to mr hocker took on a
distinctly hostile gleam

  apparently capn bob paid no attention

  anyone out in the yard andy he ac-
costed the bartender after slowly drinking
his beer

  the yard was a small plot of ground in
the rear surrounded by a high stone wall
where whalemen frequenting the flying
flukes were wont to retire to settle their
a cupid in sea boots

disputes with a searching look at the
skipper the bartender went to a door in the
back and peered through

  theres no one there captain hel-
dare he said

  as he called the skipper by name the
eyes of the unknown flickered strangely
while the skin about his nostrils folded
into a wrinkle of surprise but capn bob
busy picking his change from the bar after
paying for the drinks appeared not to
notice it

  pocketing his change capn bob swung
suddenly so as to face the unknown whose
rugged features seemed to steel themselves
as if sensing that war was brewing

  my mate here mister began capn
bob his manner deliberate but his tone
vibrant with eager animosity tells me
youre looking for some sun-stewed sperm
whalers how about it the last three
words clashed like the links of a chain

he eyes of the un-
known lighted with two
flares of fierce joy he
smiled wickedly sur-
veyed the skipper from
head to foot with a
malignant gaze and
raising his glass to his
mouth emptied it in two gulps

  thats what i said mister blazed the
unknown slamming his glass down his
big sea boots ringing on the floor as he
sprang back clear of the bar his eyes
shooting blue flame perhaps youd like
some o what i gave your mate

  now gentlemen interposed the gray-
haired bartender placatingly what do you
say to a little drink on the house and for-
get the argument

  neither paid him the slightest attention
the tropics had met the arctic and there
was naturally bound to be a clash

  not here sir rejoined capn bob
calmly though the hairs on the back of his
neck bristled there aint hardly sea
room for them boots of yours theres a
back yard out there-

  three quid to ten bob on sea boots to
win piped a half-drunken cockney sec-
ond mate wholl tyke me  he looked
about over the tables

  ill take you snapped the surgeon-
major reaching for his purse with the
aid of a third party the bet was made

  that gives me an idea flashed capn
bob who had heard the wager

  digging down into his pockets be pro-
duced a handful of gold and silver which



he laid on the bar he looked at the little
heap a moment and unfastened his gold
chain and watch and placed them beside
the money

  put your pile against mine he chal-
lenged the sperm whaler and ill en-
deavor to prove to you that the tropics aint
taken the guts out of all of us by a damn
sight how does that suit ye sea boots 
im as tickled as an injun with a sack-
ful o scalps rumbled the unknown
heres mine he pulled out his money
and put it beside the other aint quite
as much value as yourn he debated ap-
praising the others money and watch but
i guess this here- he pulled out a mag-
nificent gold hunting-case watch looked at
it earnestly and with a hoarse chuckle un-
hooked the chain from his vest and placed
it on the bar will even things up but i
tell ye right now young feller i wouldnt
risk that turnip if i wasnt mighty sure of
gettin it back again an thats the truth
enough said that remains to be
seen countered capn bob crisply take
care of this stuff bartender and give it to
the one that comes back first out of the
yard come on sir

  in another half-minute the combatants
their faces set like flint went out into the
yard the bartender with a hopeless shrug
of the shoulders locked the door behind
them some of the patrons who had seen
how easily the man in the big sea boots had
defeated the mate began offering bets of
three to one that he would trim the other
in less than ten minutes the sporting
surgeon-major and mr hocker covered
them all

  ten minutes passed and the latter two
collected another ten passed and yet an-
other ten and the patrons began crowding
about the door straining their ears to catch
some sound that would indicate which way
the battle was going nine minutes more
and there came a fumbling knock at the
door everyone drew back in a fever of
expectancy as they watched the bartender
insert the key and swing the door open
a deep murmur of amazement followed
this movement

tumbling into the
room came capn bob
heldare one eye com-
pletely buried beneath
purple swollen lids the
other gleaming wildly
from the midst of his
bruised and bloody fea-
tures his shirt hung in strings about a


frontier stories

splendid torso the skin of which had been
pounded into the semblance of raw beef
steadying himself against the end of the
bar be dragged a decanter of brandy from
the shelf and holding it to his puffed lips
took a regular cape horn snifter and set
the decanter back with a steady hand

  never mind me he sputtered taking
the wet towel the bartender handed him
and beginning to mop his face see to
sea boots out there i tried to bring him
to sos we could shake hands and come in
together but i couldnt hes the best
i ever saw-nearly had me licked twice
tend to him quick

  mr hocker took the towel from the
skippers hand dipped it in water and
sponged the latters face for a minute or
two

  thatll do till we get aboard ship sam
he mumbled thanks lets see how our
friend is getting on 

  they followed the crowd out into the
yard

  sea boots was lying under die brilliant
rays of the full moon unconscious and
barely breathing huddled on the spot
where he had crashed after receiving a
sense-destroying uppercut to the jaw in
falling his head had come in contact with
the edge of a half-buried flower pot near
the wall and he had sustained a severe
scalp wound

  the surgeon-major bent over him for a
little while then rose and gave some order
to a soldier standing near the latter
saluted and vanished the surgeon-
major sidled up to capn bob who had
found his coat and was putting it on

i er-pardon me but you are a ship cap-
tain i presume lie said

  yes sir master of the whaling bark
stormy petrel 

  the surgeon-majors heavy mustache
lifted in a smile

  you seem to be a proper skipper for a
ship of that name by jove do you know
this man you fought

  dont know him from adams off ox
replied the skipper who is he any-
how

  nobody seems to know the bartender
says he never saw him until two hours ago
some captain whose ship got in late this
afternoon probably the surgeon-major
looked around and stepped closer to the big
whaleman and lowered his voice i say
captain this might get you into a rather
nasty mess court proceedings and all
that yknow this man has the appear-
ance of being severely injured ive sent

for the stretcher to take him to the hos-
pital he may be there for some time
which means that your ship will be de-
tained here indefinitely very awkward
yknow

  awkward as hell sir agreed capn
bob who had been listening with ever in-
creasing dismay as the surgeon summed
up the situation

  now continued the surgeon-major
im not advising you or interfering in
any way merely suggesting that all in-
conveniences arising from this situation
could be avoided by leaving port instantly
up anchor and away well take care of
the man

  yes sir acquiesced the skipper rub-
bing his aching jaw i guess thats the
best way out of it damn the luck he
added mentally here ive only arrived
in port from a cruise on the - grounds
latitude n longitude w three
hours ago and now i got to go to sea
again

  what was even worse he reflected was
to be compelled to leave port without get-
ting his letter from rose russell the
letter due on the schooner lottie beard a
whaling tender running between new bed-
ford and st helena would tell whether
her father had consented to let her marry
capn bob and if so whether she could
come to cape town-at which port the
stormy petrel would call in five months
there the ceremony could be performed
the lottie beard was expected to arrive
any hour now yet he could not wait for
her to sail meant five months more of
torturing suspense before he learned the
outcome of roses letter written from
new bedford to her father in kamchat-
kan waters telling of her engagement to
capn bob and asking the consent to their
marriage

  heres some of my orderlies coming to
take this man to the hospital whispered
the surgeon-major goodby and a pleas-
ant voyage

  thanking him heartily capn bob and
hit mate slipped through the nearly de-
serted barroom and hurried down to the
landing place where the skipper engaged
a boatman to take them off to the vessel

  with his broad shoulders bowed capn
bob sat in the stern sheets and gloomed
at the bottom-boards as the boat went
skimming over the moonlit water it was
plain hell he reflected over and over again
to have to sail without hearing a word
from rose but if he stayed and the ship
was delayed on account of this mess as it
a cupid in sea boots

undoubtedly would be he would lose his
command no owner would tolerate a
skipper blameless or not who had been the
means of keeping his ship from pursuing
her voyage and this was his first com-
mand

  when nearly to his ship he was roused
by the noise of an anchor chain roaring
through a hawsepipe which echoed over
the quiet harbor as the sound waves re-
bounded from the granite head a little
exclamation of joy escaped from his
puffed lips as he saw that a three masted
schooner had come to anchor about a
cables length outside of the stormy petrel

  the lottie beards in sir announced
mr hocker

see theres a chance
to get our mail yet ill
go aboard my ship and
then you take the boat
and go over to the
schooner for our let-
ters said bob eagerly
in a few minutes they
were alongside the gangway capn bob
was about to grasp the manropes when the
mate shoved a cigar box into his hand

  careful ye dont drop it sir he cau-
tioned

  what the devils in it rasped the
skipper his nerves worn to a frazzle by
the events of the evening

  yer winnins the bartender put em
in the box an give it to me for ye

  damnation id clean forgot it all
right hurry over to the schooner now
give my compliments to captain markand
but say nothing about whats happened
you understand

  he clambered up the ships side and the
boat shoved off capn bob watched it for
a little lamenting the fact that his battered
condition prevented him from going him-
self and having a talk with captain mark-
and for rose had lived in new bedford
with the marklands since her mothers
death five years ago

  drawing a deep breath capn bob went
below pausing outside the second mates
door to instruct him to call all hands and
heave short on the chain as they would get
under way as soon as mr hocker re-
turned going into his own cabin the skip-
per surveyed himself in the glass

  holy mackerel he ejaculated im
mighty glad rose isnt here to see me now
the next twenty minutes he was busily oc-
cupied in bathing and dressing his numer-
ous injuries



  this done and arrayed in a clean suit
of white duck he left the room and glanced
up at the clock under the skylight it was
ten-twenty he saw the cigar box lying
on the table and was about to open it when
he heard the boat bump against the gang-
way and the next moment there came
floating down to his ears a musical and
distinctly feminine laugh

  puzzled capn bob stepped to the open
door leading into the forward cabin and
stood listening a sudden apprehension
tightening the strings of his heart he
heard mr hocker talking to someone and
the mate was answered by a voice which
the skipper considering his present condi-
tion knew only too well it was the voice
of his betrothed-rose russell

  please dont bother mr hocker ill
run down and take him by surprise

  capn bob had no chance to recover
from his amazement for the next moment
a slim willowy brown-haired girl whose
blue eyes mirrored such a wealth of kindli-
ness that no one even noticed her nose was
a little irregular came bounding into the
cabin with a little gurgle of joy she was
about to throw herself into his arms when
she caught sight of the numerous patches
of court plaster on his face and his livid
swollen eye

  o-h-h-h she gasped recoiling with
a shudder bob bob what have you
been doing recovering she stepped up
to him and laid a hand on his arm you
promised me bob dear that after that ter-
rible battle with the champion that youd
never fight again she added in a voice
of mingled commiseration and dismay
and now- a tear glistened on the
thick lashes

  i-i dont think youll blame me rose
dear he stammered when you hear the
circumstances but tell me first how you
come to be here he led her to the tran-
som sofa and stood looking down on her
his back to the swinging center light

  i came out on the lottie beard with
captain markand and his wife theyre
in the boat alongside now ther wouldnt
come aboard with me said two were com-
pany and gracious im glad now they
didnt she took one of his big hands
and laid her soft cheek against it ive a
wonderful surprise for you dear but ill
say no more till you tell me what hap-
pened did you-did you beat him bob

  her fathers consented to our mar-
riage  capn bob told himself his pulses
leaping for how otherwise could her
presence be accounted


frontier stories

  yes i got a little the best of him but
i had a mighty hard time doing it as you
can judge he told her about it how
a stranger had beaten his mate and insulted
all sperm whalemen by asserting that they
were some degrees lower than a clamdig-
ger how he had merely followed the un-
written law that a skipper must stand by
his officers under any and all circumstan-
ces rose knowing how dearly capn bob
loved a fight smiled to herself as she went
to the rack against the mizzen mast and
poured a glass of water from the carafe
after drinking it she stood with one hand
resting on the table a half-proud half-
pitying look in her eyes

  but capn bob went on seems this
man is hurt pretty bad so bad they took
him to the hospital and to prevent the
ship from being held here a month or more
i must sail immediately theyre heaving
short now

  you mean youre going to sail right
away cried rose

  i must dear theres no other way
out of it if im to keep command of the
ship the owners would never stand for
the delay

  she was a whalemans daughter and she
understood she nodded mutely her hand
straying absently to the cigar box and lift-
ing the cover nervously up and down while
her distressed eyes roved about the cabin
as if seeking some other solution to the
difficulty

  come rose make up your mind im-
plored capn bob come with me your
father must have given his consent or you
wouldnt be here now that was your
wonderful surprise wasnt it ill take
the ship to the south of the island and
well have the minister at sandy bay
marry us and were oft we can write
your father about it when we go into cape
town five months from now will you
marry me now rose dear

  she wavered blushed and lowered her
gaze to the table he was advancing his
arms outstretched when he saw her sud-
denly go white as she held the cigar box
open and stared down at the watch capn
bob had won from sea boots he heard
the quick intake of her breath as she picked
it up stared at the case for a long moment
and then opened the back

  where did you get this watch she
asked suddenly turning to him her eyes
steadily accusing

  capn bobs big frame squirmed visibly
rose had forgiven him for fighting but
with her abhorrence of gambling would

she forgive this betting transaction but
resolving to make a clean breast of the
whole miserable episode he told her just

how the watch came into his possession

  her eyes were fixed on him in horror as

he finished

  you-you took this watch from the
man-tlie man you beat so-so that he had
to be sent to the hospital oh gracious

god

  i he watch slipped from her nerveless
grasp and would have fallen to the carpet
had not the skipper adroitly caught it and
placed it on the table

  yes but rose it was a square deal i
know i oughtnt done it but-

  he made a step toward her utterly at
a loss to account for her taking the matter
so hard

  dont-dont touch me please bob
she quavered

  she retreated her slim body swaying
like a flower in a gale to the sofa and
burying her face in her hands burst into
a flood of tears

  oh bob bob bob she sobbed
that is dads watch

or some minutes an un-
canny stillness per-
vaded the cabin save
for the faint clank-
clank of the windlass as
the chain came in and
the slap of the tide
against the ships coun-
ter rose offered a broken sob now and
then capn bob himself had been struck
speechless had the heel of the mizzen
mast suddenly left the keelson and come
soaring up through the cabin he could not
have been more thunderstruck

  finally shaking himself he found his
voice

  your fathers watch

  ye-es i knew it at once-the harpoon
and lance crossed over the whales head en-
graved on the case-his name in the back
oh its dad youve nearly killed  she
started up wildly hes in the hospital-
and i waste time herel

  without a look at him widiout so much
as a farewell rose snatched up the watch
darted through the forward cabin and up
the companionway to the deck

  capn bob made no attempt to stop her
or go with her what was the use  mr
hocker would show her over the rail
with her thoughts on her father in the
hospital capn bob felt that his presence
would only serve to aggravate her feelings
a cupid tn sea boots

  after a little while capn bob shook
his head sadly going on deck he stood by
the rail watching the boat by then a hun-
dred yards or more away he could see
plainly however in the milky moonlight a
pathetic little figure huddled with bowed
head between the bulky forms of captain
markand and his wife the bowed head
never raised as he gazed she never looked
back

  walking the poop with long nervous
strides capn bob tried to piece together
some of the segments of his world which
had come crashing so suddenly about his
ears how the devil did capn ben russ-
ell happen to be in st helena when rose
had told capn bob five months ago that
her father was in kamchatkan waters
nearly fifteen thousand good sea miles
from home was this the wonderful sur-
prise rose talked of and anyway if
capn ben russell had already consented to
roses marriage he must have known that
he was fighting his prospective son-in-law
for the bartender had called the stormy
petrels skipper by name loud enough for
the whole roomful to hear what was
capn ben russell up to

  chams up an down sir roared mr
hocker for the third time from the focsle
head

  right set topsls then break her out
fill away on the port tack mr hocker
and send a man to the wheel

  twenty minutes later the stormy petrel
her sails contoured into rounded canvas
shells by a smashing southeast breeze was
cutting through the long irregular shadow
cast over the harbor by that huge sombre
pile of rock known as ladder hill

  the breeze steadily increased until by
eight bells midnight it was blowing half
a gale the second mate coming on deck
to relieve mr hocker found the ship
swinging tgallant-sls and tearing along
like a racehorse with three feet of green
water in her lee scuppers her decks slanted
like the roof of a barn and the spray flying
over her knightheads clear to the rovings
of the fore lower topsl

  whatn hells the old man tryin to
do turn the ole gal over growled the
second mate working his way up to the
binnacle and casting his eyes aloft at the
straining canvas and the sullen clouds rac-
ing across the face of the moon

  damn if i know grated mr hocker
looking at the tall figure leaning against
the weather topmast backstay but ive
an idee this here suits the skippers mood
he lowered his voice to a confidential tone

t

him an his gal must a had a row she
had both eye-pumps a-goin in great shape
when i showed her over the rail an he
never come up to see her off the ship he
never told me nothin but i guess miss
russell tore inter him about fightin he
sure looked a sight an no mistake

  ah thell rumbled the tough second
theres plenty o gals but ships like this
is hard to find hope he dont run the ole
gal under he added as she scooped in
the top of a foaming green one over her
lee cat-head

  no fear the old man knows his ship
been second mate an mate o her afore he
was made skipper he knows what she
can stan dye see course is souwest by
west mr knolls an the orders is not to
take in no sail without consulting the skip-
per

  mr hocker went below and turned in
when he came on deck at four oclock he
found that the wind had moderated a little
and in the pale light of the descending
moon he saw the form of his skipper still
leaning against the backstay

  had a hell of a ripsnorter o a squall
shortly after four bells the second in-
formed the mate i asked the old man
should i take in the tgallant-sls an he
never even looked at me jest waved me
away an about that time the squall hit us
holy jiggers i never see such carryin on
sence tar an oakum come into fashion
my hair fair riz but by godfrey dinged
if the ole gal didnt seem to like it lay
down to that squall as steadys a church an
never parted so much as a ropeyam shes
a sweet ship an no mistake but the old
man must be all shot to pieces about his
gal or hed never sail the ship like that
mr hocker crammed a wad of tobacco
into his lean cheek and looked at capn
bob who was staring out across the waste
of waters in the direction of st helena

  yep hes in trouble an looks like
the ship knows it shes tryin to help
him all she can in her way dye see arter
alls said an done mr knolls the best
friend a sailor has is his ship aint it the
truth

n the next thirty days
the stormy petrel had
taken seven hundred
and fifty barrels of oil
making in all from the
time they had left new
bedford six months
and a half ago one
thousand and fifty-one barrels a splen-

did record for a new skipper to put in his
log-book for a delighted owners perusal
but though all this served to help capn
bobs troubled spirit to sustain its load
his grim face showed no elation as mr
hocker commented on their unusual luck
while they finished cleaning ship after
stowing down the oil from their last whale
at about eleven oclock the next morn-
ing friday the mastheads reported a sail
broad on the starboard quarter and coming
down before the wind

  the st army petrel was jogging along
under all plain sail her exact position by
observation that morning being lat 
 s lon   w  with the wind about
a point free and capn bob held his course
until he could make out the other vessel
as the whaling bark two sisters of new
bedford

  her skipper was undoubtedly bent on
having a gam for he had set all his muslin
and was heading so as to intercept the
stormy petrel also in a few minutes
more he ran the code flag over h up to his
peak signalling

  heave to i have something important
to communicate

  capn bob smiled grimly as he read the
signal through his glasses

  i suppose that old busybody of a hi
tibbits is still in command of her mr
hocker he observed he probably
called into st helena before coming down
here and got an earful of my doings there
well i dont want to hear it and i dont
want that rheumy-eyed pest aboard no-
how you there bill to the man at the
wheel keep her off seven points brace
in your yards mr hocker and well put a
stretch of blue water between us and that
babbler as quickly as possible

 with the wind on her quarter the
stormy petrel was soon showing a clean
wake to the slightly slower vessel astern
and capn bob was congratulating himself
on having avoided an awkward meeting
when there came a sudden bellow from the
main masthead

  ar-r-r bl-o-o-ow-bl-o-o-o-w-thar he
whitewaters sparm whales sir a bull
an two cows looks like

  where away yelled capn bob his
eyes kindling all else forgotten for the mo-
ment

  two pints on the port bow an bout
a mile away sir came the answer

  damnation ejaculated the skipper in
vexation suddenly mindful of the fact that
if he stopped to lower he would be over-
taken by the two sisters but whaling

was the game and he must play it though
the heavens fell and so with a sort of
premonition that this day would disclose
some remarkable events capn bob gave
the order to square yards and head for the
whales

  after a short time a light squall struck
the ship taking the wind with it as it
passed over and leaving the stormy petrel
lifting to a glassy sea the two sisters
still held a breeze but soon ran down into
the calm belt where she lay tossing with
slatting sails about a quarter mile away

  the spirit of the chase now sperm
whales were spouting less than a half mile
away fired capn bobs blood and he cared
not at all if that other skipper knew what
had happened in st helena his sole ob-
session was to get his boats into the water
and be the first into that pod of whales

  but though his men worked with a fury
of haste the two sisters was equally quick
in lowering it now developed into a race
between the rival boats as to which should
get fast first and in consequence officers
and men strained every nerve the light
cedar crafts flying over the water like so
many gulls

  with his nostrils expanded to inhale the
exhilarating saline odor emanating from
the immense creatures capn bob steered
his boat between the flukes of the two cow
whales making for the big one hundred
barrel bull that was about fifty feet ahead
out of the clew of his eye the skipper
caught a glimpse of a rival boat steered by
a clean-shaven giant who was urging his
men  in a hissing whisper

tand up ike capn
bob ordered his boat-
steerer in a low tense
tone as the great shin-
ing hump of the mon-
ster bull broke water a
half boats length awav
ike peaked his oar in a
flash and springing up snatched an iron
from the crotch and fitted his knee into
die arch of the clumsy-cleat

  capn bob gave a sudden swing off on
his twenty-two foot steering-oar and
blackskinned the head of the boat onto
the whale at the same time shouting to his
boatsteerer to dart the latter immedi-
ately planted two irons to the service in
the bull just forward of the hump a
second or two later an iron from the rival
boat whizzed through the air and also
toggled solidly in the whale
a cupid in sea boots

  stern-stern for your lives bellowed
capn bob

  as soon as his boat was clear of those
lethal flukes which were threshing the sea
to foam he turned a face red with wrath
upon the officer in the rival boat

  what d ye mean damn you fastening
to my whale he bawled i aint going
to halve the chances cut line and get the

hell out of this you know-

  he never finished the sentence for the
whale suddenly settled in the water like
so much lead and the next instant came up
under the keel of the two sisters boat
lifting it bodily into the air and spilling out
everybody but the boatheader the latter
was stooping for a knife to cut the line
when to capji bobs horror one of the fly-
ing coils whisked about the officers legs
and he disappeared like a flash over the
bow of the boat as the whale started off
on a mad career

  pull ahead men roared capn bob
noticing that the whale had stopped sud-
denly and was about to mill around well
get that fellow

  the boat shot ahead a couple of lengths
and capn bob yelling way enough
grabbed the boat-knife and plunged over-
board a dive of three feet under water
and a few powerful strokes brought him
to the taut line which he severed with one
stroke of his knife with the free end of
the line in his hand he broke water close
to his boat passed the line to the boat-
steerer and telling his crew to haul in on
it climbed back into the boat

  the men hauled with a will and in a
minute or so to their inexpressible amaze-
ment up popped an immense pair of sea
boots but they lost no time in speculating
what kind of a whaleman it was that wore
such unusual foot gear for tropic whaling
for they immediately perceived that the
owners feet were still in them and that he
was hanging head down in the water
whereupon with no little mirth they drag-
ged him into the boat

  the rescued whaleman slumped in a
dazed way into the stern sheets spat out
a mouthful of salt water squilgeed his face
with a lumpy forefinger and then turned
a pair of strangely familiar blue eyes on
the skipper of the stormy petrel

  as capn bob met their amused gaze he
started and gave a snort of surprise

   well im damned he spurted out
if it aint capn ben russell i thought
i knew those boots

  before he could find anything further
to say the mate of the two sisters laid his



boat alongside and capn ben jumped
into it

  ill be aboard an gam ye tonight capn
heldare he sung out across the inter-
vening water for the bull had started to
iun again and was rapidly towing capn
bobs boat away an be kind enough to
wait for me this time cussed if i aint
been lookin for ye all over the south at-
lantic 

eviathan mad clear
through and looking
for fight gave capn
bob no time to analyze
his feelings at being
thus abruptly confront-
ed by his st helena
antagonist for hardly
had he changed ends with the boatsteerer
when the bull snapping his spout-hole in
an excess of rage made a dash for his en-
emy his eighteen-foot lower jaw dropped
to its fullest extent in readiness to be
throwm over the boat

  quick as winking capn bob snatched
up the loaded brass bombgun and slapped
the butt to his shoulder

  steady now ike he cautioned the
boatsteerer while he eyed the oncoming
monster when i fire low the heasjkof
the boat to port as fars you can otand
by now everybody

  came a half-minute or so of nerve-
racking suspense just as it looked as if
boat and men would surely be engulfed
in that cavern of a maw the whale rolled
partly over at full speed checked himself
and threw his great lower jaw armed with
forty-nine eight-inch ivory tusks out of
water so close to the whalemen that its
shadow fell across the boat this was the
moment the skipper had been looking for
and with a steady finger he pulled trigger
sending an eighteen-inch bomb slap down
the whales gullet into his vitals

  with the report of the gun the alert
boatsteerer gave a mighty heave on his oar
and the boat spun clear of the half-breach
which leviathan gave as the exploding
bomb tore his throat to fragments then
the boats crew gave an exultant cheer for
after this fling of agony the giant bull
milled partly round and began spouting
thick blood in another minute he went
into a short flurry rolled partly over his
junk to the sun his jaw hanging down
loosely one finstuck out at right angles
to his body and rising and falling with
the motion of the waves leviathan was
fin out-dead

  and all this time a slim willowy girl
with tender blue eyes had been watching
the combat through her glasses from the
poop of the tuo sisters

wreathed in smiles
capn ben russell

  over a glass of old medford capn ben
told how he happened to be in st helena
at the same time as capn bob anxious
to see the man his girl had chosen for a
husband he had accepted a good offer for
his vessel and sold her to a firm in hako-
date japan he had come home from
there by steamer and rail arriving in new
bedford two weeks after capn bob had
sailed not caring to remain idle capn
ben had bought out capn hi tibbies in
the two sisters and sailed for a cruise in
the gulf of guinea after arranging for
rose to come out oti the lottie beard to
st helena at which port capn bob was
scheduled to call to meet the schooner

 dakota territory aug-
 ust   a young
 civil war veteran el-
 lis taylor peirce whose knack for dress-
 ing gunshot wounds had given him the title
 of doc volunteered to prepare the body
 for burial

   doc found bill lying on the floor of
 jerry lewis saloon with his right arm
 twisted under him and his legs drawn up
 mccall had slipped through a back door
 and shot bill in the back of the head

   the miners loaded the dead man into a
 wagon and dragged it up the gulch to his
 camp

   doc washed the blood off the fourteen-
 inch golden-brown hair and cut off a few
 locks for mementoes

    charlie utter bills partner appropri-
 ated the gunfighters cap-and-ball six-
 shooters the guns formed the bulk of
 the hickok estate

   a curious crowd watched docs under-
 taking operations noting the many bullet
 scars on the long white body there was
 a fascination about the remains of the man
 who had placed so many gun-throwers in
 the position his body was occupying but
 there was not much comment when a
  man is dead there isnt much left to talk
 about

   mccall was tried by a miners jury and
 acquitted he declared bill had killed his
 brother doc said the murderer lied mc-
 call lost  time in leaving deadwoud

later the killer was picked up in laramie
wyoming by a u s deputy marshal
taken to yankton dakota territory and
there hanged by the neck until extremely
dead doc said there were neither flowers
nor regrets and that the only feature of
the job that displeased him was that it had
been so long neglected

when what is now north and south
dakota was dakota territory the
governor had the right to appoint county
officers but the black hillers of the roar-
ing seventies were like the americans of
 they resented long-distance govern-
ment by some political jacksnipes in
s the men of custer exercising their
anglo-saxon rights organized a county
and elected officers the town of custer
was then a cluster of cabins in a beautiful
patk in the southern black hills

  doc was elected sheriff his office
was a mud-chinked log cabin he was
thirty-one years of age a heavy-set full-
faced man with a droopy mustache a
straight well-formed nose hair inclined to
waviness grayish eyes and a high fore-
head

  the governor sent in some sneaking car-
pet-baggers who managed to steal the rec-
ords of the new county and move them to
hayward a log cabin camp in penning-
ton county where they had a townsite
erabbed


frontier stories

  pennington already had a county seat
doc couldnt see whv it needed two he
told me that he thought it wasnt right for
pennington to go round collecting county
seats that way

   so he put on his buckskins oiled up his
six-shooter and started out to recover his
county seat he had a posse with him but
one of his followers feeling that there
might be a leetle shootin acquired a bad
case of cold feet and took his chilled
dogs into the brush to nurse some
warmth into them

  but there was no shooting the carpet-
baggers lay down and turned up all fours
doc put his county seat in a cigar box and
took it back to custer but later the carpet-
baggers proved too strong for him

  first thing he knew he was in jail in
pennington county a friend fred ev-
ans the freighter put up his bond money
and he was released but destiny was
waiting around the corner to give doc his
revenge he was later elected sheriff of
pennington county and presided over the
jail in which he had once been confined

a grumble in one of his letters to
me about the inaccuracies in ac-
counts of early days in deadwood

    i see they now have calamity jane
  the sweetheart of wild bill actually i
  never saw them speak to each other
  next thing i suppose theyll have jane
  married to sitting bull

  doc knew jane in her palmy days he
never had much to say about her alleged
scouting and indian fighting when id
ask him about her scouting and indian
fighting hed sidestep with some outrage-
ous yarn like the following

    i was bedded down in my camp in
  some jack pines above deadwood
  dreaming i was being tortured by in-
  juns all of a sudden i woke to find
  calamity jane had part of my blankets
  she had spurs on and being restless
  had been rowel ing me

     i sat up and she sat up with me she
  came with a full hand-two sixes

     dont git sentimental she snaps
  her thumbs on the hammers or ill
  fill you so full of lead theyll have to as-

   say you to tell who you lie and where to

  send you

     boy theres no romance in a woman
  with a high temper who sleeps with her
  spurs on i let her have the blankets
  scat

  i talked with calamity jane in dead-
wood when she was old and broken and
ready to die she was worrying childishly
about an old liat she had left in mac the
saddlers place i could get nothing out
of her about the old days i gave her a
piece of money and let it go at that she
died a few weeks later and the black hills
pioneers buried her near wild bill

  doc sent me a photograph of jane in her
prime

  a sturdy full-faced young woman with
a strong straight nose small deep-set eyes
a generous mouth with drooping corners
and dark hair there is little feminine
softness in her face her jaw and chin
show a masculine heaviness

  im not inclined to believe the stories
about janes scouting and indian fighting
i always regarded her as a rough-neck hen
who was trying to develop spurs and a
crow

  here in part is what doc wrote on the
back of janes picture

    jane canary born in old fort lar-
  amie wyoming mother a laundress
  father u s teamster she died in the
  black hills april  good-hearted
  but a very hard formation

a little yarn from one of docs
letters to me

    when i came to the black hills in
  the first days of  there wrere still
  some of those french canadian trappers
  on the different streams they called
  themselves hudson bay men but they
  were all from montreal originally

     one of those old ducks told me about
  finding another trapper years before
  over on the belle fourche river he
  and his partner had just arrived and
  were looking for a good place on the
  lower belle for winter headquarters
  they found a place that suited them
  and went up-stream with some beaver
  traps
random shadows of theold frontier

h 

    it had been deadly cold the river was
  frozen over solid they noticed what
  at first looked like the butt of a log on
  the bank they went up to it to drag it
  down for firewood but when they got
  to it they discovered it was a man
  lying on his stomach partly on the
  bank and with both hands frozen in the
  ice

   they chopped him loose in drag-
 ging him out they found that both his
 hands had been caught in a beaver trap

    in setting traps for beaver after a
  freeze-up bob they cut two holes in
  the ice that not only lets in the air to
  bring the beaver but it helps in placing
  the trap just right to catch the beaver
  when he comes to the hole for air

    the trapper said the poor fellow must
  have set his trap and then while feeling
  around the pan to see that there was
  nothing under it to prevent it springing
  he accidentally sprung it and was caught
  by both hands and held there for keeps

    they had no way to bury him while
  the ground was frozen so they dragged
  the body down to their camp and kept
  it a few days thinking the dead man
  might have a partner in that vicinity

    but no partner came looking for him
  they laid him on the ground and piled
  large stones over him until spring came
  and to keep the wolves occupied they
  scattered poisoned bait around the
  grave

    on the body was one of those little
  tricks catholics wear around their
  necks emblems of their religion his
  passbook showed his name to be an-
  tonie deteinne montreal canada

    the cold and snow kept the body in
  good condition until the spring thaw
  when they gave it decent burial and
  placed a marker over it

some comments and recollections
prompted by reading an army yarn of
mine

               pa-ha-sap-pa full moon
  my dear bob

    i have read your story it is a good
  one but bob how many can grab it
  except those who have seen service or
  one who has been under a dummy of-
  ficer 

    a man never knows what he will do
  under fire i have seen damn fools go
  in laughing and others crying and all
  stick

     we had a first lieutenant who would
   jump into a fist fight but whenever we
   went under fire the big chawbacon
   would      

   i had to delete here this is a different
world from the old plain-spoken frontier
and doc sometimes forgets that sad fact
he continues

     it was a lot harder for me to stand
  waiting to get into action than action
  itself for the excitement steadied my
  nerves after the old gun got wanned up

    bob i was just thinking i would
  leave you my old pearl-handled six-gun
  shes a smith and wesson  cal if
  you hold her right shes sure to commit
  some depredation

     i dont remember how you hold a gun
   bob but i learned something from my
   former captain in the civil war who
   was made a major on the field after
   major johnston was killed in the cen-
   tralia massacre september  my
   old captain always threw his gun over
   his left arm and grabbed his right shoul-
   der with his left hand which gave him
   a perfect brace draw your gun back
   but not so the end will drop down and
   nip your arm like mine once did when
   my horse jumped

    i thought last evening that squaw
  winter was coming but the thunder did
  not bring any rain and were in the clear
  today gee how i would like to go
  out in the open again and have a taste
  of sage and ashes once more but im
  hamstrung by age and have to play old
  red cloud and stick to the tepee

     ill send the old six by express as i
   hear they wont let us send guns by
   parcel post strange isnt it might
   make some of those sleepers in die post-
   office wake up to have a gun go off oc-
   casionally under their bills

     the old hills are more beautiful this
   fall than i have ever seen them the
   grass stayed green all summer on ac-
   count of the changing climate and so
   much rain frost has painted the vines
   and trees

    im getting pretty wabbly and my
  trailer doesnt seem to track any more
  im like an old wagon wheel after the
  boxing is worn out but from the chest
  up im all right well i would much

  rather it would he that way than to
  commence at the top like an old oak
  so many of these old soldier boys die
  at the top and go around drooling like

     well bob my tank is about dry and
   i think it a good time to hang up

     adios and good luck to you boy

doc

in the following doc packs the hist-
ory of a frontier town into a handful
of type

     bob they moved the bodies in the old
   cemetery at sidney nebraska the other
   day ill give you a partial list of what
   they found

     army officers buried in steel caskets
   with glass windows they were so well
   preserved-theyd been embalmed-that
   their red faces shining through the glass
   gave even the undertakers a start

     some of the skeletons had their boots
   on and several had baling wire around
   their ankles wrists and necks making
   it easy to guess how they had died

     one woman had a baby in her arms
  and her skull riddled with bullets-most
  likely ambushed by indians

     a big regular soldier had on his blue
   army overcoat the same being well pre-
   served

     one person had evidently been buried
   alive for the skeleton was on its face

    an old man and his son who were
  murdered fifty years ago were recog-
  nized by the marks of the ax on their
  skulls the man who killed them was
  there too and while they were digging
  him up the sheriff who had executed
  him died going and coming bob go-
  ing and coming

     many men were found with their hats
   covering their faces the sign of violent
   death and hasty burial

    was thinking last night bob of
mcdaniels joint in cheyenne a gam-
bling house and tough theater under one

roof

   in bull train days mcdaniels got most
of the bullwhackers money and his
girls got the rest

   one evening clays outfit got through
loading late so cal ayers brother to
george of deadwood told the bull-
whackers they could spend the night in
cheyenne

  dirty jake and mexican joe were
pards they hurried down to mc-
daniels got a table near the stage and
called for beer the show was one that
ran on forever jake with his tonsils
floating on beer finally laid his tired
head on the table and dreamed i sup-
pose of chuck holes on the black hills
trail

  they were playing what the bull-
whackers called meller-drammer sud-
denly an old battle-ax came rushing
down to the footlights showing the two
teeth she had left and screeching like
a mountain lion my reputation is
ruined ruined ruined

  her squawking awoke dirty jake
he raised his head up slowly like a
land turtle looked her up and down and
then bawled

   serves you right you shouldnt a
gone in the ark with noah

d

oc was always writing me about old-
timers some extracts

i invested twenty-five bucks in a his-
tory of south dakota in five volumes
by my old friend george w kings-
bury of yankton s d who started a
newspaper in dakota territory in the
early sixties

a glimpse of a raw night in old
cheyenne

   i sent for a book by captain gilette
who spent six years as a texas ranger
talk about dare-devil work  pre-
sented the book to old jesse brown
sturgis s d who was a shotgun guard
on the gold-dust coach running out of
the black hills in the early days hell
lap up the texans book like a kitten
licking sweet cream
random shadows of the old frontier

     jesse and cap willard have written
  a book on stagecoach days cap died
  very suddenly so jesse got a man to
  edit the manuscript i wrote a few
  pieces for the book and dick hughes
  threw in some as jesse and cap had
  asked us to help out a little

     old uriah gilette of slate creek is
  here in the soldiers hospital   

  let me cut in here doc

  i was placer ing on slate creek before
my sixteenth birthday and knew old uriah
and a lot more like him

  i remember slate creek mighty well be-
cause one morning nearly out of grub
and with my boots stiff from working in
the water i put a frying pan full of grease
on the fire and ran down to the creek bare-
footed to get coffee water

  returning i saw the grease was blazing
it was precious stuff and i grabbed the
handle of the frying pan it was hot and
turned in my hand the panful of flaming
grease struck my bare foot

  the agony was intolerable i ran down
to the stream and plunged my foot into
the ice-cold water that solidified the
grease when i removed the grease a
good deal of the flesh came off with it

   i lay in a lean-to three days and nights
on the fourth day i wrapped my burned
foot in flour sacks and walked forty miles
yes i remember slate creek

  doc rambles on about his old slate
creek pard

     old uriah is about ready to cash in
  i put my old carcass into a car and went
  up to see him i asked him if he re-
  membered the man who with clark e
  stocking and himself pursued the road
  agents after the cold springs robbery
  it was some time before he recognized
  me and remembered our ride after the
  bandits who by the way failed to get
  away with the gold

    at last his memory got out of the
  gumbo he grabbed my hand with both
  of his and cried like a child

     doc he said you dont know how
  glad i am that you come up to see me

    poor old boy teeth gone eyes
  glazed dying at the top like an old oak

    one veteran of the mexican war
  died here recently he was in the nd
  dragoons he was a giant in size and

  was close to the century mark when he
  let go hed been a u s scout and
  had lived in the open so much that he
  was as tough as shagbark hickory
  theyve stopped raising his kind all
  they want now is something that knows
  enough to read a sign and is just strong
  enough to press a button

    just got a letter from dick hughes
  the old-time black hills journalist one
  of the finest characters i have ever
  known and whom you i know will re-
  call with pleasure poor dick is all
  drawn out of shape with rheumatism
  of the joints and has to be handled like
  a baby but hes game-game as they
  make em he ties a pencil to a long
  stick and uses his shoulder in writing-
  the swinging motion a hard job for
  poor dick bob when we start to grunt
  about our own ailments we should re-
  member there is always some man suf-
  fering far more and that too without
  squealing

    jim brennan charlie ham and john
  spayde called on me the other day how
  old we all have grown yet it seems
  like yesterday when we were young full
  of hope looking toward the rising in-
  stead of the setting sun i looked around
  at the old crowd white-haired and
  headed for the boneyard wrinkled up
  like egyptian mummies with the wrap-
  pers off i knew i was in the same fix
  i dont want to look in a mirror again
  bob

his seventy-nine years are crowding
doc to the wall he writes

    bob theyve shut off my licker and
  tobacco they claim the stomach cant
  handle the redeye and that the tobacco
  makes the old heart get out of step
  what then is there left nothing ex-
  cept to look at the scenery and bother
  my friends with my letters couldnt
  sleep tonight so thought id write a let-
  ter to bob dont mind me boy or let
  me interfere with your work you get
  paid for what you write and i dont so
frontier stories

dont bother about answering until
youve nothing else to do

before we lope on again with doc
let me unwind a few paragraphs about
the black hills

   the early paradise of the sioux his last
hunting ground for wild romantic beauty
there was in my day no country in the
world to equal the black hills of south
dakota as a boy wandering with an in-
dian pony i dreamed along their singing
streams loafed in their tiger-lily-spangled
parks built my campfires in their deep can-
yons and in the depths of their pine for-
ests

   i loved and still love those mystic moun-
tains and have tried to tell of their charm
and beauty in song and story but when i
knew them there were no forest officers
no cement highways no signs to tell about
such and so breakfast food no coughing
consumptive jitneys none of this mess
called civilization there were mountain
ranches with lazy cows straying through
the timber there were spring houses
with the milk crocks standing in cold pure
water there were wild raspberries to
throw in a dish and drench with pure rich
cream there were deer jumping tip in
droves here and there one would find an
old prospector sitting in a shady nook
smoking placidly and working a rocker
there were carefree men shoveling gravel
into roaring sluices in canyons where al-
ways was the smell of fresh water and the
tang of pine there were dusty roads and
trails winding through the canyons across
the lovely parks and into the deep woods
the great spirit created a masterpiece
when he made the black hills

  doc is thinking of the old free days
when a man only needed his rifle a bag
of salt and some tobacco to be independent
and happy he takes his pen in hand and
throws this loose

    my mouth has been watering lately
  for a taste of wild meat roast buffalo
  hump would go good or some venison
  steaks fried with bacon maybe some
  of my friends will knock over a deer
  when the season opens and remember
  old doc ive plenty of yaller-legged
  diickens but once in a while i get a

  hankering for wild meat i would sure
  like to break out in the open again and
  broil a piece of venison or flip a flapjack
  or two

i never could get doc to take dinner
with me at the evans then the biggest
and most pretentious hotel in hot springs
south dakota he had some sort of preju-
dice against the evans dining-room i im-
agined that it was because some gourdhead
newly arrived in the black hills had at-
tempted to impress the old-timers with a
dinner jacket bought second-hand in sioux
city or omaha

  however doc would sit with me on
the big porch during the pleasant summer
evenings and watch the hotel guests dance

  the leader of the orchestra was a hair-
tossing jumping jack for some time doc
regarded him sadly as if wondering why
he was permitted to live

  then he turned to me and after some
smoky comment on the violinist told me a
little story of a night in the roaring camp
of dead wood in the red red long ago

  there was something in the yam that
touclicd my then youthful fancy-some-
thing that lingered i put it into verse and
here it is

doc peirces choice

the injuns claim a bear is wise
as anything beneath the skies

and thinkin doc peirce bout the same
they handed him his bear tracks name

a big hotel with doc and me
on the pahzazza and there be
a fancy fiddler playin of
some hifalootin dream of love

says doc that feller probly thinks
that lies a lulu when by jinks

with all that flip and flop and twist

hes jes a dude contortionist

that sound he makes dont touch no part
of the old common human heart

a deadwood night doc smiles that

  takes

its sinnin straight till morning breaks
that roars on through without no stops
except fer him the quick gun drops

ah rough and tough that long slim town
random shadows of the old frontier

that strings her light the canyon down
a healthy cussedness ill say

not like the muck we see today

id not been long in that wild camp
before old natures crushin stamp
falls on my heart and i well i
am that homesick i want to die

i see a place and in  bust

to watch the games and see the dust
a-changin hands and likewise see
if any soul on earth knows me

no chalk it down produce your dust
the barkeeps never heard of trust

no jawbone goes throw down the gold
and play the game and play her bold
dont try no bluff put up the stuff

or youll be leaded quick enough

and then a sad-faced kid walks in-
young drifter with a violin

it is his game to play a while

and then collect in preacher style

now talk o makin dumb things speak
you oughta see that there boys cheek
lay lovinlike on that noise box

while on his heels he stands and rocks
and lets his soul drift down them strings
and tell you all lifes sweetest things
he stopped-the world got dark and cold
like when you know youre gettin old
and then i says to him right then

say son i antes up a ten

if youll jes give my heart a treat-
play sunny southern skies complete

the poor kid nods then snugs his chin
up close to that old violin

and draws the bow- oh boy oh boy
she right then starts to cry with joy

but underneath the happiness
run little homesick moans i guess

god knows i swallowed-yes more too
grass isnt all that carries dew

and then through misty eyes i sees
one tough old sport pretend to sneeze
a-lettin on he had a cold

uh huh sniffs i that game is old

and then i pulls my hat lid down

and goes my way through deadwood town
with that old tune a-hantin me-

dead lonesome-lonesome as can be

   neath sunny southern skies you bet
sure made some long-dry eyes spring wet
thats why this high-flung music goes
 right past my ears and never throws
one throb beneath my vest bgee

that pawer digs no sympathy

because hard luck aint crushed the loon
and put some heartache in his tune

thats why my choice  always throw
strong on that piece played years ago
by that poor lonely driftin kid

his past a blank his future hid

just him and his old fiddle brown

with luck a-playin up and dovrn

he had his scars twas plain to see
thats why there in his music be
the feelin strong the human pull

that made throats hurt and eyes get full
upon us all his spell he laid

because hed suffered what hed played

some time ago doc sent me his pic-
ture with this written on the back

     bear tracks last stand on the sun-
  set trail ellis t peirce born near
  philadelphia penn april  
  died in the black hills of south da-

bear tracks chief

  i	have not heard from doc for many
months the ominous silence tells me that

i	shall never hear from him again i dread
to write-dread to know for a certainty
that he is gone perhaps on the back of
his picture he called the turn on his pass-
ing if so the sign of farewell may the
old-timer find good camps green grass
and running water his pards will miss
him and none more than bob

  ed note-ellis taylor peirce died at
the battle mountain national sanitarium
hot springs south dakota on august 
 many old-timer friends rallied at
his funeral speaking of the simple ser-
vices the hot springs star and times
herald remarked there was about the
whole service an air of tender yet not
gloomy farewell that touched the note of
docs personality and life it was as though
he had gone on to camp for a night or two
beyond and would be there in the dawn
waiting
the
cross and double cross

                   by martin stevers

   stcamboating the missouri in the old days was sufficiently adventurous with-
   out carrying a cargo that would prove a magnet to every croolc on the river

sudden babble of
laughs and talk broke
out on the cargo deck
of the river packet
eagle as she rocked
gently at her moorings
beside the st louis
levee in april of the
year  a moment later the rousta-
bouts dismissed for the day streamed
across the gangplank and up the broad
levee toward the city the last of the
eagles cargo had been stowed and she
was ready to start her first trip of the sea-
son up the missouri to the dakotas

  at the sound two men who had been
pacing the texas or topmost deck of the
little packet stepped to the rail on the city
side one was a red-haired barrel-chested
man with arms that extended gorilla-like
almost to his knees-captain andy cor-
bin master of the vessel the other in
many ways was an antithesis to the fiery
captain he was a pink-cheeked pudgy
man with round blue eyes that by their
constant stare of astonishment showed his
lack p adjustment to the asperities of
frontier life he was david harker chief
clerk of the english banking firm which
was backing corbin as master of the eagle
likewise harker was purser for the voy-
age

  it was he who broke the silence

  i say he commenced in the clipped
accents he had brought from london
everythings ready now except setting
sail-and our bookings wont let us do that
till morning so why not get ourselves a
bit of dinner at the best tavern in town 
last chance for some months you know
captain andy chuckled and his blue
eyes twinkled but behind the twinkle
an alert observer could have caught a touch
of grimness the tone of his voice
strengthened the impression

  that would be the ticket he said if
this was an ordinary voyage but youre
forgetting it aint ordinary this time not
by a darn sight it aint you aint forgot
have you that this crook blake has been
here all winter cooking up a deal with the
big banking crowd  and you aint forgot
that hes bumin to pay me back for block-
ing that platte river steal of his last sum-
mer or the pleasant ways he has of paying
off old scores

  despite the springtime warmth harker
shivered ever since reaching st louis
he had heard tales of blake and his opera-
tions on the upper missouri-activities that
made even the toughest frontiersman shake
his head and he had heard hints of what
blake meant to do to captain and as
soon as the eagle got into wild country in
the cross and double cross

the spring now the eagle was starting
and that meant trouble at any moment

  i see you get me captain andy went
on in his deep rumbling tones so for
this little dinner-you can go if you want
to but im not setting foot off this packet
until shes well up the river and if youre

wise youll not-

  he broke off suddenly to scan the shore
line harker following the direction of
his gaze saw that a man had debouched
from one of the streets and was casting
about along the upper edge of the levee
evidently seeking some one of the many
boats suddenly alert harker watched the
stranger until andy touched his arm and
nodded toward the newcomer

  lessn im wrong the captain said
that fellow is one of blakes men works
for a bank that blakes got in with this
winter i mean and ill bet dollars to
doughnuts hes looking for us want to
lay a little bet

  harker all thought of dinner gone
shook his head it had all seemed unreal
to him before this talk of frontier feuds
and peaceful traders assailed by murder
but now this unreal thing had come to
them was casting about in the person of
this clerk to commence the battle

  suddenly the stranger catching sight of
them in the gloaming waved his hand and
headed for them arrived at the levees
edge he stood peering up at them as they
scanned him from the texas deck

  how are ye captain he called
 bout ready to pull out

  his tone and inquiry were friendly
harker thought for an emissary of the
enemy but andy was noncommittal

   bout ready as were goin to be i
reckon he called back leaning both el-
bows on the rail anything i can do for
you 

  maybe the other answered our
banks got something wed like to go up
the river and seeins how youre pulling
out fist wed like to have you take it
might le all right andy replied
providin taint too large aint got much
room left

   twont take room the clerk called
back not much moren a carpetbag full
how soon can we bring it on

  that news heightened harkers alarm
a small shipment meant something special
-and anything special meant some scheme
blakes or so instinct whispered har-
ker was glad the captain took time out be-
fore answering though he wondered



whether the answer when it came was
wise

  sooner the better i guess vfas the re-
ply can you have it down right away
-or got it with you 

  no the other responded turning to
leave its at the office but theyll have
it down in half an hour-soons i can get
back and tell them much obliged to ye
captain for helping us out

uch obliged for noth-
ing andy growled as
he turned from the
rail for a moment his
rough-hewn ruddy
face showed worry
then to harkers sur-
prise a smile flickered
over his lips and was followed by a
laugh

  you look as if the british guinead
turned to pewter he said whats the
matter-worryin cause it looks like were
in for a little scrap

  not a bit of it harker protested
though his face belied his words but im
wondering-dont you think it a bit risky
you know to take their bloody shipment
couldnt we save trouble by saying
no

  captain andys brows knit suddenly
and an ominous spark flashed into his eyes
as he stared at harker

  no we couldnt he snapped couldnt
let blake think were afraid of him for
one tiling or let the bank be telling around
that we were afraid to take a shipment
and if we blocked this dodge blaked try
another so we might as well lick him at
this one

  the grimness of his expression deep-
ened as though at some sudden memory
then he shrugged and his touch of temper
vanished

  come on he said and see what the
cook can do for us long as the trouble s
started we might as well meet it as moan
about it and youll feel better for having
a good meal under the belt when they come
aboard

  obediently harker followed the captain
below and stood by while the steward
made things ready aside from a few
comments the meal was eaten in silence
and in less than fifteen minutes they were
back on the texas deck

  it was completely dark by now-the vei-
vety dark of a warm spring night save
where lamps in uncurtained windows shone
like large yellow stars against the black


frontier stories

background of the town and surrounding
hius soft lapping of water against the
packets side and distant bursts of laughter
from groggeries along the waters edge
punctuated rather than relieved the si-
lence it was a night for happiness and
joy of living but all harker could feel in
it was the soft touch of intrigue and trou-
ble more than once he thanked his stars
for the presence of the formidable cap-
tain dimly discernible as he leaned watch-
fully against the rail

  the suspense however was not pro-
longed within ten minutes captain andy
stirred suddenly paused an instant to lis-
ten then turned about suppressed ex-
citement rang in his tones

  theyve showed up he said come
on along and see whats what

  harker his knees wobbling a bit now
that the test had come followed him down
the forward stairway to the cabin deck
then down to the top of the hill which was
the cargo deck together they crossed the
long gangplank to the levee as footsteps
sounded above a moment later figures
loomed through the darkness-several of
them

  the color of their garments made them
visible sooner than men wearing the cus-
tomary black of that day would have been
they were clad in the blue-gray worn by
the regular army at the time and they
were bearing muskets with bayonets that
gleamed dully in the night light

  sodgers captain andy muttered to
harker wonder why theyre mixin in
makes it complicated

  as the group drew near in its midst
harker made out a muffled figure-the
banks representative he surmised a sus-
picious bulge beneath the visitors cloak
strengthened the supposition that would
be the shipment-something small and
light as the clerk had said it would be

  at the foot of the gangplank the cortege
stopped and the muffled man spoke
captain corbin he inquired im

here to come aboard-

  come right along captain andy an-
swered i havent lit any lanterns but we
have some inside go light up will you
harker

  at the word harker departed for the
cabin above and the visitor set foot upon
the gangplank an explosive sigh sug-
gestive of relief escaped him

  you can hold your men there sergeant
tompkins he said until i return just
watch that nobody comes aboard

  yes sir came the answer from be-

hind in the tones of a well-drilled noncom
the sound of musket butts rapping on the
levee as tompkins ordered ground
arms put a period to the answer the
visitor turned to captain andy

   all right captain he said sorry to
be so late-but ill tell you what its all
about when were aboard could we go
to your office

  sure andy said and led the way to
the forward cabin on the deck above

  the cabin was a long room entered
from the open space across the forward
end of the deck and flanked on either side
by cubby-hole staterooms harker had not
troubled to light its lamis excqt at the
after end where the bar stretched its
length across almost the entire room be-
hind the bar a small opening had been cut
in the wall to give communication with a
room beyond on the shelf in this open-
ing was a small whale-oil lamp glaring at
them like a smoky yellow eye staring
through the shadows harker was no-
where to be seen

  in the dim light captain andy could see
his visitor shudder a trifle

  huh he snorted glancing swiftiy
about the cabin your man has a saving
disposition captain with the lights where
is he anyway

  in his office there behind the bar
andy answered nodding toward the open-
ing with the lamp its the only office we
have so well go there come on through
from the opening a narrow corridor ran
farther back toward the womens cabin
its after end lost in sooty darkness a door
about six feet ahead on the landward side
emitted a block of yellow light to illum-
ine the way

  as they reached the door harker came
from inside the room lifted the bar which
blocked entrance and ushered them in
they took chairs and for a moment eyed
each other without a word

he visitor was not of
the usual frontier type
he was a lean hatchet-
faced man with a
hawklike nose and cold
sharp eyes somewhat
obscured by square-
framed glasses al-
though the night was warm he kept his
cloak clasped about his throat and its dark
folds added to his ominous appearance

  well he said when the silence was
becoming noticeable my names townley
and im cashier of the missouri and kan-
the cross and double cross

sas traders on some business we have
with h l blake if you know him i
suppose youre surprised at seeing me
here

  we are andy answered its no
secret in these parts mr townley that
you wouldnt be here in usual course of
business when blake had anything to do
with it so its plain something queer is
in the air and were wondering what it is

  townley shot him a sharp glance then
blinked behind his glasses

  ive heard you were a blunt man he
said and i can see why but youre
right there is something-something
weve never had to handle before-and we
need a good man to help thats why we
come to you now ill tell you all about
it

  from beneath his cloak he drew a large
tin dispatch box and set it on the table
both harker and captain andy watched
him narrowly waiting to hear what he had
to propose

  the whole thing is he said keeping
his hand on the dispatch box weve gone
into a railroad deal with blake up in iowa
were ready to go ahead now and our man
on the ground needs money-plenty of it
so weve got to send it to him

  but we havent been able to keep a deal
like this quiet and a lot of people up iowa
way know the moneys coming i dont
need to tell you what that means you
knowing the river as you do it means
every gang in three states will be sniffing
around to get a crack at the money and a
good manll be needed to get the money
through and youre the man the way we
look at it to do the job if youll take it

  captain andys jaw set and he stared
thoughtfully at townley in the lamplight

  sure well take it he said and if
any gang gets the money itll be better
than any gangs been yet how much is
it

  townley let a thin smile slip over his face
-the first evidence he had shown of hu-
man feelings-and drew the box nearer to
himself get ready for a surprise he
said i dont know about you he went
on with a glance at harker seeings how
youve come from a british bank but
captain corbin here is going to see some-
thing hes never seen before-something
thats hardly been seen west of washing-
ton if you ask my guess

  he threw open the lid of the box and
waved his hand over its am tents

  have a look he said at half a mil-
lion dollars in real money



ii

 alf a million silence
 fell in the stuffy little
 cabin-silence as thick
 as the darkness that lay
 on the night-shrouded
 river-while they stared
 at the crisp yellow bills
 twinkling up at them in
 the lamplight they could hear each other
 breathing hear the ticking of captain
 andys watch and the lazy lapping of wa-
 ter against the eagles sides half a mil-
 lion  no wonder the gangs would be gath-
 ering harker thought and no wonder a
 good man would be needed to get the
 money through

   captain andy broke the spell

   well he said its a sight of money
 but well handle it so we might as well
 count it in are you ready

   townley smiled again and took up a slip
 i of paper that lay on top of the money

   all set he said heres a tally-
 handing the slip to harker--and you can
 check off the amounts as i hand the money
 to captain corbin i see you have a
 strongbox that will do and heres ten
 thousand in treasury hundreds to start

   the counting proceeded monotonously
 with captain andy inspecting each packet
 carefully both as to amount and character
 of bill-a necessary precaution at the time
 when private bank notes of various degrees
 of worthlessness still filled the country as
 he placed the packets in ae strong box
 harker checked off the sum until all had
 been counted over then townley handed
 captain andy a duplicate of the tally to
 sign a receipt

   as he dipped pen in ink andy glanced
 sternly at the cashier

   im taking this he said like ordinary
 cargo-due care and diligence but no in-
 demnity or warranty of special care if
 you dont like that you can take the money
 back

   townley waved his hand in an expansive
 gesture

   your due care and diligence captain
 are enough for us as for indemnity we
 have insurance

   he took the receipt placed it carefully
 in his wallet and rose

   just one thing more captain youre
 going through wild country and youre go-
 ing to have a hard time getting through
 when its known you have this much money
 with you so we arranged with the com-
 mander of the st louis garrison to send a
frontier stories

detachment of soldiers along if you want
them theyre the men below and theyll
report to you if you want them

  sure thing said the captain wed
pull through without them but im not one
to turn down help send them up

  all right townley said and drew
some papers from an inside pocket

 heres a letter to you from the com-
manding officer and a copy of the orders
he gave them so youll know how you
stand with them and that  guess is
all

   he closed his dispatch box replaced it
beneath his cloak and held out liis hand

   good-by captain he said and good
luck with the job

   captain andy shook hands gingerly and
townley left andy listened until the vis-
itor was safely out of the forward cabin
then slapped his hand down heavily on the
strong box

  well he demanded what do you
make of it 

  harker looked helplessly from andy to
the money and back again

   i cant make head or tail of it he con-
fessed theyre up to no good i sup-
pose yet this chap townley was fair-
spoken enough and this military escort
looks like honest help perhaps they really

want us to take this money to iowa-

  huh andy snorted and there was a
somber glow in his eyes as he stared from
beneath lowered brows at harker the
banks square like enough but that dont
count when this skate blakes mixed up in
the deal its just his way to line up some-
thing respectable then hit at you from the
middle of it hes using the half million
hes talked out of this bank to bait a trap
of some kind and dont you think nothing
else and with that amount of money
aboard the tripll be a record breaker or i
dont know the missouri

so lets get these soldiers aboard and
grab some sleep while we have the chance
well be needing clear heads if ever they
were needed commencing at daylight to-
morrow morning

t nine oclock next
morning the roust-
abouts carried the last
bales of belated mer-
chandise alxard and de-
posited them upon the
broad open cargo deck
a few passengers who
had lingered in the warm sunshine pouring

ujjon the levee hastened aboard captain
andy turned from the port rail of the
lexas deck and addressed the first mate-
formally since this was an occasion of
ceremony

   guess you can cast off now mr smith
seems as how were ready

  smith stalked forward to execute the
order and andy rqlaced his elbows on
the rail it was his invariable custom on
leaving a landing to wait in that spot on
the landward side watching everyone and
everything that came aboard and he was
doubly careful now

  a stentorian lellow sounded forward-
mr smith getting the crew into action
mooring lines were cast off and the gang-
plank started to swing in in another mo-
ment the eagle would have been under
way but a shout rang from the upper
levee edge and some belated passengers ap-
peared-three of them two men and a wo-
man

   captain andy roared an order the sec-
ond mate in the pilot house rang the en-
gines to stop and smith on the cargo deck
let the gangplank stay outboard the pas-
sengers scrambled aboard and the packet
made a second start the huge red paddle-
wheels creaked then began to slap the
mud-stained waters in steady rhythm
obediently the eagle slipped from the
levee into midstream first boat of the 
season to leave st louis for independence
fairport and the upper missouri

   captain andy turned from the rail puz-
zlement over the belated passengers in his
eyes he had recognized all three one
from long and unpleasant contact in st
louis and on the river he knew to be
pittsburgh jake a black-hatted frock-
coated bully and cheap gambler who rated
among the worst of the many that infested
the river waters the others he had
learned when they engaged passage were
a farm couple bent and worn from long
years on the ohio soil going to what they
hoped would be kindlier life in kansas a
more ill-assorted company could hardly be
imagined

   but that wasnt the root of andys won-
derment when they had appeared jake
had been sharing the baggage-carrying with
the man and helping the woman along
and he had continued to do so until they
were aboard it was the decent thing to
do of course and the tiling most men
would have done but it was the first time
andy ever had known or heard of jake
doing the decent thing clearly the leopard
was changing his spots unless-
the cross axd double cross

  theres something back of it he told
tiimself never knew jake to act like
that before looks like id better be keep-
ing my eyes on all three of them its sure
getting to be a complicated trip

  a sudden burst of hot words on the deck
below testified to yet another of the com-
plications as though the money and now
the question of jake and his associates
were not enough the shout evidenced trou-
ble  another score although in politics
the twenty-year-old missouri compromise
had quieted the slavery question the mis-
souri river country had not shared the
peace the popular sovereignty doc-
trine which later was to drench kansas
with blood had not yet been invented but
even so the free-soilers and slavery men
traveling the river were increasingly bitter
toward each other a little whisky a taunt
or two and there was sure to be a fight
and captain andy from the looks of the
crowd aboard knew that he had a choice
cargo of trouble in this respect-trouble
that might even now be starting

  but the quarrel below died down as
quickly as it had started-so he started his
customary tour of inspection first came
inspection of the cargo the boilers and the
engines then the time-lionored ceremony
of selecting the best deckhand by the sim-
ple expedient of letting aspirants for the
honor fight it out that done he under-
took what would be the real inspection for
this trip-examination of the passenger
quarters and a look-see at the passengers

  at first glance everything seemed in
order as much as a packet load of trap-
pers plainsmen settlers and gamblers
could be expected to be in order the few
married couples aboard had retreated
discreetly to the womens cabin in
the after portion of the boat many
of the quieter sort among the men
had disposed themselves in favorable spots
along the little passageway running around
the cabins and were watching the monot-
onous procession of hills trees and muddy
farms that slipped to the rear as the eagle
chugged and plopped up-stream

  yet there were signs of trouble exactly
where it might be expected-among the
free lances gathered in the forward cabin
handy to the bar as he passed through
andy noticed that jake and one or two
others of the gamblers had started little
games and he nowbed something ominous
about jakes conduct for once jakes
mind was not on the cards he was keep-
ing one ear cocked to hear the talk at the
bar  ami the talk did not promise peace for



the balance of the voyage two or three
times andy caught the sure catchwords of
trouble-free soil and states rights
jakes erstwhile companion the little
farmer was an active talker in a group of
free-soil men the chances looked excel-
lent for trouble within an hour

  captain andy however merely shrug-
ged that was all part of the business
something every missouri river captain
faced just as he faced the snags and sand
bars of the river he had more important
cares this trip and it was time he was see-
ing to them-commencing with a visit to
his reinforcements the soldiers

  because of the eagles reputation for
ability to take care of herself he had de-
cided the night before to keep tompkins
and his men out of sight unless absolutely
needed therefore he had turned his cabin
over to them with orders to keep the
blinds drawn keep quiet and not stir out
unless summoned so he climbed to the
texas deck and started for his cabin abaft
the wheelhouse to see how they were stand-
ing the drastic regimen

  but the visit was not made as he laid
hand on the door knob a burst of brutal
laughter rang out below and a light foot-
step sounded on the deck behind him he
whipped around only to recoil hastily the
newcomer was a woman the very one jake
had helped aboard and she was visibly per-
turbed her face was working beneath
her sunbonnet and she was wringing her
hands under cover of her shawl evidently
trouble for the voyage had begun

apt ain andy whip-
ped off his cap and
stepped toward her at
the same moment an-
other laugh rang out
below-with an uglier
quality this time she
started at the sound
and her terror deepened

  whats the matter maam captain
andy asked patting her on the arm are
they too rough for you below you
mustnt mind a little shouting and singing
you know

  i dont she answered in a choking
voice but you must come captain its
my poor thomas-my husband-and

theyre-theyre picking on him-

  captain andy choked back a curse if
he remembered correctly her husband was
a mean-spirited little runt just the sort
a crowd of river toughs would pick on for
frontier stories

amusement still here was his wife and
she was distressed about it

  still another stentorian laugh rang out
from below-one with ihe ugliest quality
of all at the sound andy jumped

  dont you worry maam he called
and darted for the stairs three ape-like
jumps with his huge hands and long arms
swinging him along on the stair-rails
brought him to the cabin deck and he scut-
tled in to the forward saloon for a mo-
ment his eyes accustomed to the clean
bright air of the texas deck saw nothing
through the haze of tobacco smoke that ed-
died and billowed inside the cabin as the
passengers milled about in it then his vi-
sion cleared and he saw the trouble

  there was a break in the crowd and in
the break was the little farmer and jakes
game started earlier in the morning had
broken up-for the little fanner was held
by the collar almost clear of the floor by
jake himself a giant in comparison un-
questionably events had moved quickly in
the few minutes andy had been away

  at that moment jake shook his erst-
while companion with one hand and took
a glass of whisky from the bar with the
other

  so youre a temperance man are you
he roared well its time you drank to
what you believe so put it down like a lit-
tle man come on now-one two-

  but the three was never uttered a
long arm swept up between him and the
little man breaking his grip then a red
and club-like fist hit him once square on
the point of the chin he spun back against
the crowd grabbed for the bar missed it
and slumped to a sitting posture on the
floor from there he stared upward his
eyes spinning oddly at the figure tower-
ing over him

  no you dont growled andy from
the depths of his barrel-like chest as he
swayed on two short legs tliat bowed out-
ward as though they had given way some-
what beneath the weight of his massive
torso not on the eagle anyhow you
tend to your business and let this man tend
to his get that plain 

  he waved a fist in front of the others
nose then turned to the little man he
had learned nothing of the right and wrong
of the affair but he knew the tiling to do
right now he must get the combatants
separated and give them time to cool down
out of sight of each other

  come on he said to the little chap
your wifes waiting for you on the texas
deck better come with me

  goin to join the ladies came a mock-
ing call from the crowd it stopped short
as andy whirled about thereafter the
crowd was silent while he piloted his
charge to the cabin door

  youd better stay on the texas deck a
while he said here sam he called
to a nearby deckhand take this gentle-
man above and see that he and his wife
have chairs

  content to dismiss the matter at that lie
slapped the little fanner on the back and
turned away but the farmer did not ac-
cept the dismissal

  capn he said and stopped andy
wheeled

  yes he queried impatient to le gone
dont bother with any thanks its all in
the job you know

   taint that said the other though
im sure grateful but seeins how you
helped me i thought id help you theres
trouble cornin for this boat-trouble i
know about-and i want to tell you what
it ft 

  captain andys impatience vanished in-
stantly this might be news that would
point the way through all the eagles trou-
bles all other business could wait on a
prospect of learning anything like that

  trouble coming you say he ex-
claimed what kind of trouble

  the little man answered yankee-fashion
-with another question

  ever hear tell of the turnbulls

  the turnbulls captain andy echoed
then stopped

  the other neednt have asked if he had
heard he had all too often so had all
the other river men and the united states
government and the perplexed govern-
ment of the state the turnbulls were the
most noted band of desperadoes west of
the mississippi at that time and their ter-
ritory one hundred and fifty miles up the
river was shunned as though afflicted with
the plague so ruthless had been their oper-
ations

  and mention of their name almost made
further information about the nature of
the trouble superfluous if the turnbulls
were concerned captain andy knew just
what the eagle might expect and about
when the blow would fall the thing worth
hearing would be any details the little fel-
low might know

  yes ive heard of them andy an-
swered grimly what about them

  the little mans face twisted into a sar-
donic smile and a gleam came into his
eyes
the cross and double cross

  well its this way he replied
theres some of their men on board i
think and i heard them talking this
jakes one of them and when you get
down in the turnbull country these men
are goin to jump you and the rest is corn-
in aboard youre goin to be raided
thats what it is

  raided well that was what he ex-
pected captain andy told himself but
how did this little fellow know about it-
and what more did he know could it be
that he was betraying confidences reposed
in him by jake before they came aboard
he seized the others arm in an eager grip

  what else he demanded who was
it you heard talking-and where

  the other shook his head

  i didnt see em he answered they
was around a corner over there he
pointed to the narrow gangway leading
aft outside the starboard cabins i
thought i knew that big brutes voice when
he picked on me i dont know no more
than i told you

  but as he said it andy suddenly caught
reason to doubt the statements during the
brief colloquy the little mans shiftiness
and his way of glancing sidewise at the
river had tended to confirm the captains
low estimate of him but now after
making his denial he came through with a
glance as steely and straight as a rifle bar-
rel evidently he was not the weakling
he had seemed

  plainly too his denial of further knowl-
edge was false else why should he have re-
vealed himself in his anxiety to know how
the statement was received 

  still if he chose to stop there andy saw
no way of making him go on not now at
any rate so he asked an aimless question
or two then thanked the other and gave
up the farmer started for the texas deck
and captain andy anxious to turn over
this strange new turn of affairs in his
mind started to follow but with the
other there his favorite nook at the port
rail would be untenable he reflected sud-
denly so as second choice he started for
harkers cabi

he awed crowd parted
yielding him a clear
passage to the pursers
office and he entered
shutting the door be-

ll	i n d him harker
whose reddened per-
spiring face showed the
effects of a busy morning looked up with



alarm that turned to relief as he recog-
nized his visitor

  its you he exclaimed im jolly
glad after all thats happened looked to
me like youd get killed if you kept on like
you were going

  what do you mean- andy asked
been worrying cause i calmed down that
fellow jake a while ago when he was pick-
ing on the little fanner 

  the fanner oatsby partly that i
couldnt see where oatsby was worth wor-
rying about wby didnt you let them
fight

  cant have that sort of doings on the
eagle for one thing andy explained
and for another it let me in on some-
thing i wouldnt have known otherwise
youll agree it was worth a fight when you
hear what this fellow-oatsby you said
his name was-told me

  briefly he repeated oatsbys news with
enough in addition to make the situation
clear the way harkers jaw dropped and
the color drained from his face told elo-
quently enough what he thought for a
moment he said nothing then speech
came with a rush

  but these turnbulls wherell we run
into them and what are they like

  captain andy grinned though with a
light of battle in his eyes

  well theyre the toughest gang this
country has ever seen and they work about
a hundred miles up the river from here
so well run into them first tiling tomorrow
morning lessn the eagle hits a snag or a
sandbar between here and there

  good lord  harker exclaimed that
doesnt give us much time to get ready for
them what are we going to do about
it

  that drawled andy seating himself
is what i came to talk about and im
talking stead of deciding cause this time
im up a tree

  he paused drumming his fingers on the
chair arm while harker stared then he
explained

  if it was just the turnbulls he said
i wouldnt worry two minutes bout it
if we couldnt lick them wed deserve
whatever happened jake and his gang
make it more troublesome but i could fig-
ure to handle them same time as the turn-
bulls but it sticks in my mind that well
have more than that to worry about

  that shipment of money there- he
nodded at the strongbox-is what gets
me i cant see where it comes in yet ill
bet its at the bottom of everything
io

frontier stories

  of course it is harker broke in
the reason for its plain enough seems to
me its bait to draw trouble and pon my
word its been successful and the banks
not the loser if the turnbulls get it that
chap tovvnley said it was insured so
blake wouldnt have trouble talking them
into shipping it by the eagle where itd be
sure to make trouble for us

  but andy shook his head

  you dont know blake he replied
hes been a tough operator for the last
ten years and he hasnt done anything by
halves yet he might ship the money by
us to cause us trouble but hed go on and
arrange the trouble too likewise hed
have moren a plain gang fight hi his
scheme lessn hes changed his ways

  no theres something more to it some-
thing we dont see at all and its my
guess the troublell pop right when were in
the middle of things with the turnbulls

  another thing i dont like is this fel-
low oatsby and his fight with jake maybe
i didnt tell you but when they came on
the boat they were thick as thieves then
an hour later we find them fighting-and
on top of that oatsby lets out all he knows
bout jake looks funny to me

  i  dont see why harker returned
their failin out is natural enough for
rnffiians of that stamp and after they
fell out why shouldnt a little rat like
oatsby revenge himself by telling all he
knew

  because he isnt a rat of that sort
andy declared roundly hes got nerve
enough to fight his own battles if im any
judge of human nature he wouldnt run
telling stories without he had a reason

  well its a tangle if there ever was
one-whats that the captain demanded
suddenly

  he pointed to a banknote lying on the
table beside the strongbox harker handed
it to him

  its counterfeit i believe he ex-
plained this fellow jake paid it over the
bar and im not sure-you have so many
banknotes in this country-but it doesnt
look right to me so i held it out to see
what you thought of it

 captain andy took the bill and scanned
it it was a ten-dollar note issued by an
ohio bank and a moments inspection con-
firmed harkers opinion of it the erratic
workmanship left no doubt that the bill
was counterfeit

  but if jake had passed one counterfeit
-acting upon a sudden idea andy rushed
to the strong box demanded the key from

harker and scrutinized the money how-
ever his idea had to be abandoned as
quickly as it had come unquestionably
the money in the box was genuine he had
made no mistake the night before on that
score

  then on the heels of the discarded no-
tion came another-a bizarre fantastic no-
tion but as andy tested it against every
question that had troubled him one by one
it answered them so far as he could see
the riddle bad been read 

  i bet ive got it he explained ive
got what blakes up to now-and hes
never hatched anything better i can tell
you the turnbulls aint more than a
starter in the scheme if we hadnt seen
through it hed have had us nailed even if
we killed every turnbull in the lot

  pie all but capered in his excitement
while harker looked increasingly blank

  but see here the bewildered purser
demanded i cant follow you at all
what is the bally scheme now that youve
guessed it 

  relief over seeing his way clear through
the tangle of troubles ahead had sent
andys spirits skyhigh

  why its plain as daylight he re-
plied just put together everything thats
happened and you cant miss it dont
you get the idea

  no pon my word i dont harker
snapped if you know what theyre up
to why keep it a confounded secret why
not out with it

  captain andy laughed harkers angry
impatience made the temptation to tease ir-
resistible he glanced at his watch let-
ting harker wait then rose leisurely to
his feet

  i tell you what ill do he said its
nearly noon now and there aint time to
explain before we cat but ill do better
than tell you ill show you-either in the
next half hour or bout supper time-and
ill bet ten dollars that youll see their
game without my saying a word is it a
go

  ten dollar-two pounds-of course
the purser agreed it will be worth that to

know whats what but-

  never mind said andy theres ten
dollars up and ive got to get ready to
scoop it in so ill be off to get things

started just one thing- he stopped

at the door as he said this and was sud-
denly serious dont leave this office for
any reason-any reason not if the boat
takes fire-till i come back even if i stay
all afternoon likewise dont be surprised
the cross and double cross

at what happens overhead in llie next half
hour and last of all- his gaiety re-
turned again-you can kiss your ten
gooy-by cause its mine or im the big-
gest liar that ever navigated the missouri
which is saying plenty

  ill

s andy made his way
through the forward
cabin where the stew-
ards were finishing
preparations for the
noonday meal amidst
the press of drinkers
his solution of blakes
scheme looked better and better to him
likewise he saw now exactly what to do
provided his notion was verified on one
point the point he had engaged to settle
with harkers ten as a premium

  there was another difficulty-that of
getting tompkins the non-commissioned
officer to fall in with his plan from what
he had seen of tompkins however that
promised to be easy the other question
remained the important one

  first he sought the eagles carpenter
and procured a brace and bit then he
went to his cabin on the texas deck
knocked on the door and entered

  at first glance after entering it seemed
that the cabin was empty then in the
half light that was all the carefully
screened windows would admit lie descried
tompkins and his men like soldiers of
all times and lands they believed in resting
whenever possible two were sprawled on
andys bed tompkins had the couch
the others had unrolled their blankets on
the floor and were lying on them only
the muskets gleaming dully from where
they were stacked against the wall showed
readiness for trouble

  as andy looked tompkins rose

  any trouble captain he inquired
if there is you can lead us to it were
tired of sticking around doing nothing

  looks like youre tired andy com-
mented dryly as tlee or four heads pop-
ped up seal-like from the blankets no
there aint any trouble-yet i just drop-
ped in to see how you were getting on and
do a little work

  the heads dropped back again on the
blankets but tompkins descried the brace
and bit and his expression lightened with
interest

  what the borer for he demanded

making repairs or is that part of the
game 

  youll see andy returned as he esti-
mated a distance on the floor his cabin
he knew as directly over harkers office
and he wanted to pick a spot immediately
over an inner corner of the space below
selecting the proper spot he began to bore
while the soldiers crowded around

  whats doing now one of the livelier
spirits queried who are you looking in
on-or are you going to take a pot shot at
him

  that andy muttered depends on
what happens but youre talking too
much theres passengers hanging around
on deck outside and i dont want them to
hear you

  the men fell back and andy nodded to
tompkins to draw close the non-commis-
sioned officer came and knelt beside him

  i want to ask you sergeant andy
said in a low tone have you ever heard of
the turnbull gang

  tompkins face hardened swiftly

  say he exclaimed that gang has
knocked off two of my pals now different
times we was taking trains through their
country ive heard of them all right
why are they fixing to make trouble for
us

  captain andy exulted this was even
better than he had hoped with tompkins
bearing a grudge against the turnbulls
winning him to his plans would be easy

  yes they are he said but seeing
that i know about it in advance i think if
youll help we can fix them so itll be their
last trouble making for quite a while

  can you  tompkins exclaimed just
say what you want then were with you
to get them any way you thinkll work

 thats great now ill tell you my no-
tion first we could just beat the turn-
bulls off if we were willing to let it go at
that but then theyd just go back into the
woods and be all ready to raise ned the
next time they saw a chance if we want
to finish them weve got to get behind
them-cut off their retreat and corner
them

  tompkins eyes lighted with understand-
ing

  thats right he said and well cor-
ner them right while theyre raiding-no
chance to argue with the judge about any-
thing i get your idea all right

  andys smile broadened tompkins was
proving admirable

  im glad you see it that way he said
frontier stories

so ill tell you my scheme and ill bet
youll like it

  heres how i figure it out the only
stop ive got in turnbull country is at
spring landing early tomorrow morning
so thafswhere i think theyll try to hit us
probably they shipped the stuff ive got to
land to make sure id put in and thats
where well have to get them

  to do that i figure id better put you
off soon as we tie up for the night a tew
miles this side of the landing h you
dont know we never run at night on the
missouri the channel shifts too much
and has too many snags then you can
work along the river and hide in the
bushes behind the landing

   youll find a sort of bluft with a lot of
underbrush on it bout thirty yards behind
the landing theres a store there and a
little dock theyve built so you cant miss
the place you can lay in the brush till we
show up and the tuwibulls come down to
the landing then when we fire from the
boat you can jump them from behind and
weve got them

  the bit lunged forward at that moment
and captain ndy withdrew it from the
completed hole peering through he saw
harker staring upward in astonishment
also he made sure he could see the door
and the shelf where the strong box was
satisfied he stood up and addressed
tompkins

  well what do you say to it

   its all fine tompkins said and well
do it but just one thing what if they
jump you tonight while voure tied
up

  mi dont think they will they like to
work on horseback and where ill tie up
they couldnt get a horse within half a mile
of us but if they should try-well you
can leave that to me satisfactory

  yes tompkins replied ive heard
about you and i know you can handle
them now whats this for and whatll we
do about it 

  he pointed to the newly bored hole
captain andy considered

  well he answered i cant tell ex-
actly what therell be to see but ive got a
hunch so if you want something to do
this afternoon you might have your men
take turns watching and see that nothing
happens to harker i dont think therell
be anything doing though till bout sun-
set ill be back then and well see if im
right suit you 

  tompkins held out his hand

  its a deal he said and well put ft

over

unset found the boat
plop-plop ping her way
along a desolate bluff-
bordered stretch of the
tawny river a good
hundred miles above st
loui seeking a favor-
able spot in which to tie
up for the night a mile or so ahead andy
expected to reach an island that would be
just right provided the breakup of the
winter ice and the spring llooas hadnt
washed it away or screened it with a bar-
rier of snags failing the island any spot
from which tompkins could get on the
north shore and which couldnt be reached
without a ship would do for all his con-
fidence in the engles ability to lake care
of herself andy had no intention of risk-
ink a surprise attack

  the eagle rounded a turn in the river
and the island came into sight from his
post inside the wheelhouse he smiled as he
scanned it for once the missouri had
been kind the island was accessible and
suitable in every way lor a stop he turned
to smith the first mate who was standing
near

  youcan make your landing there he
said pointing and get out a wood gang
better lay in enough to last all day tomor-
row wre may not get any at spring land-
ing

  he had not told the mate about the raid
but there was no need as yet it was quite
usual on the river when not in indian
country to lay in a days supply of wood
for the boilers at the night stop and save
the daylight hours for running the mate
therefore merely nodded and continued to
scan the surface of the water for the tell-
tale ripples that warned of new mud bars
and hidden snags

  with a last look ahead andy left the
wheel and made his way toward harkers
office during the afternoon the forward
cabin he could see had become a sample
of the frontier at its wildest the air was
blue with smoke which filled the space
almost to the occlusion of vision before
the bar was a milling crowd growing nois-
ier and more obstreperous every minute as
the fast-flowing whisky fed their tempers
recklessness was in the air in explosive
quantity ready to break out into mischief
on any excuse or no excuse at all even
the morning fear of him had gone and he
had to work his way through as best he
the cross and double cross

could catching murmurs of heated talk at
every step

  harker who had remained in his stuffy
quarters continuously save when captain
andy had spelled him for the noonday
meal exhibited heartfelt relief at the skip-
pers entrance

  i hope he said youll let me out for
just a bit of a turn about the deck before
sunset id like to catch a breath of air
and see a bit of the country you know
captain andy laughed

  youll see all you want and then some
before we reach the dakotas he retorted
its time now that we settled about your
ten dollars before we go though have
you seen anything more of oatsby
harkers face clouded

  yes he answered slowly and hes up
to devilment of some sort ill warrant
hes thick as thieves with a crowd of pas-
sengers chaps of the free soil party and
theyve been hooting at jake and his crowd
all afternoon ive been watching them
through the window there and several
times i thought a row would start that
would be a nice mess wouldnt it along
with our other worries 

  captain andy nodded a fight in it-
self he didnt mind much what he had
seen coming through the cabin made that a
certainty within a few hours anyway but
with oatsby and jake in it the trouble
could be started whenever it suited their
needs that would prove awkward for
undoubtedly the trouble would start when
he should be paying attention to the money

  however nothing could be done about
it so he nodded and rose

  yes it would be a mess he agreed
and a worse one than you think but it
all fits in with-my notion of what theyre
up to so we might as well stick to the
scheme we have-beginning with raking in
your ten dollars this i think is the time
to do it so youd better close your office
and come along

  harker obeyed with alacrity putting the
little office into order in a trice then
stepping out and closing the door he drew
his key snorting with disgust as he looked
at it

  what a toy to turn on that money he
grumbled if only you had one of those

good new bramah locks now-

  howd you feci captain andy broke
in if i told you blakes bank owned the
eagle once and probably blakes hooked a
duplicate of that key from them oh its
all right he added hurriedly as harker
turned a surprised face up from his



stooped position if i didnt think he had
it i wouldnt have guessed his scheme and
i wouldnt be able to win your money
now come along and watch me do it

  on re-entering the forward cabin andy
looked about but without success to locate
jake and oatsby in the confusion noth-
ing short of a detailed search would have
proved whether or not they were there
neither was it worth stopping for so
andy piloted harker to his cabin

  i guess you know mr harker he told
the soldiers by way of introduction you
ought to if youve been watching all after-
noon

  sure we know him one of the soldiers
chirruped i could tell him anywhere by
the way he blushes on that bald spot atop
of his head

  all right andy said when the laugh-
ing had subsided t guess you didnt see
much if thats what you watched but i
didnt think youd see anything till now
and maybe even now well be disappointed
and-

  but in that he was proved a false
prophet almost before the words had left
his mouth an angry shout rang out below
-then another and still another until they
blended into a muffled roar sounds of
splintering wood became audible and even
through the deck everyone in the group
could hear the rush and surge of bodies in
the forward cabin evidently the moment
they had left jake or oatsby or somebody
had touched the proverbial match to the
explosive situation and pandemonium had
broken loose

  stand fast andy bellowed as several
of the soldiers reached for their muskets
its a trick-ill tend to it

  you harker watch that hole as if your
life depended on it and you hold your
men here tompkins and dont show your-
self lessn i send for you 

s he whipped out the
door andy cursed in-
wardly over the neces-
sity of leaving but he
forgot his chagrin the
moment he entered the
cabin below and took in
the scene a confused
free-for-all was in progress wrapped in
billowing smoke the cabin lamps shed-
ding their smoky yellow light upon the
scene were growing fewer as one after
another was knocked from its stand or
smashed bv a flying missile the shouts


frontier stories

and imprecations told that the pro- and
anti-slavery feeling had broken loose

  the second mate coming from behind
jostled andy and pointed to the forward
deck where the crew was massing

   were all here he shouted above the
din whatll we do now 

   get em inside the door and in a dou-
ble hue andy barked as he forced his
way inward from the door a few lunges
and blows cleared a space and the crew
jammed in forcing their way they mar-
shaled themselves as directed

  now sweep em andy roared and
started for the bar

   it was tough going every inch of it and
a case of dealing with eacn opponent man
to man obstreperous ones andy floored
when there was room to swing on them
others he pushed headlong into the melee
to bowl over still others the more peace-
able or those of flagging energy he seized
and flung behind his line of helpers

   twice a chair swung through the air at
his head once he ducked the second
time the chair caught him a glancing blow
with one of its rungs he bellowed and
charged into the crowd after the man he
thought had thrown it catching him he
hurled him against one then another of
the rioters nearby until he had cleared a
ring then let the man unconscious by
now slump to the floor

   that ended the rioting several of the
crew burst pell-mell into the opening en-
larged it and soon had all the combatants
pushed against one or another of the walls
that done the sailors stood watching their
prisoners and awaiting orders while andy
glanced about appraising the situation and
now that the fight was over he thought
again of his responsibilities on the texas
deck

   damn he exclaimed and beckoned to
the second mate chase them all to the
cargo he directed with a sweeping ges-
ture toward the rioters and keep them
there until you get this in order ill send
word what i want you to do next in a min-
ute or two

   with a dismal certainty that under cover
of the riot blakes men had put something
over he scuttled back to his cabin no
words were needed to tell him that his
fears were justified the evident con-
sternation of harker and tompkins was
ample testimony to that

   well whats happened he demanded
as both started to talk at once and failed
somethings gone wrong ill bet a hun-
dred

  maybe tompkins said as harker
sputtered and maybe not go on tell
him he continued jogging harker you
saw it i didnt

  why-why- harker began and
stopped but the sound of his voice proved
steadying and after a moment his story
came with a rush

  i was watching there while the riot was
going on when the door to my office

opened and somebody whipped in-

somebody who andy interrupted
couldnt tell harker snapped back
had a black hood or something over his
head he came in looked around and

then-

  yes go on andy barked the hood
was something he hadnt counted on
though it didnt matter much if the man
did as he expected he could find him
quickly enough get your breath and lets
have it

  why- harkers eyes were hollow
with despair nowr-he blew out the light
and thats all we saw

  blew out the light- andy echoed
then stopped as the full force of the news
struck him

  all his plans his preparations his hopes
for confirming his notion of blakes
scheme had been blasted by this one action
he had been defeated by the simplest ex-
pedient possible

  well of all the damned lummoxes-
he commenced then stopped again it was
hard to believe that he had overlooked
anything so simple that he could have been
so stupid then he pulled himself to-
gether there was no use in cry in g over
spilled milk now he might better be do-
ing something to retrieve the situation

  come on harker he exclaimed start-
ing for the door lets see what we can
see now anyway

  his first fear he discovered was un-
founded the strongbox was still on its
shelf lock in place and apparently in order

  lets see how it is inside andy com-
manded and harker applying his key
threw up the lid as it opened captain
andy could see that the box was filled
under the full light which poured upon
the contents when the lid was thrown back
everything seemed in order

  thank god harker said now
what do you suppose he was up to or do
you think he was scared off anyway
were clear of trouble now

  but andy was not listening he picked
up two or three packets of bills scanned
them and replaced them his brows were
the cross and double cross

 knitted and gloomy determination was in
 his eyes when he faced the purser

   instead of being safe he said were
 worse off than ever if hed tampered with
 the money it would have meant my guess
 at their scheme was right and id have
 known just how to beat them but he
 didnt-so now im up a tree highern ever
 about their scheme

   and dont kid yourself he was scared
 away its simply that their game runs
 deeper than we think

   he extracted a roll of bills from his
 pocket peeled off a ten and handed it to
 harker

   there you are he said im beat
 the only thing i can think of now is to
 watch everything that goes on and hope
 we can move faster than they do so well
 try that-and god help us if we dont see
 and move fast enough

 iv

                          the supper hour
 icted swiftly to
 is campaign of
 everything a
 - of the crew
 ationed on the
 alleyway out-
  cabins on each
 side of the packet stewards were told off
 to patrol the inside corridors unobtrusively
 but without letup and he arranged with
 harker to taketurn and turn about guard-
 ing the money through the night and all
 this while he was cursing to himself-curs-
 ing his foolhardiness his cocksure folly in
 deserting the money even for an instant

   no fool like mi old fool he told him-
 self as he concluded his patroling arrange-
 ments lessn it be an old fool who
 thinks hes an old fox-which means me

   well-therell be no more old foxing
 on this boat between here and iowa itll
 be plain bulldog and watchdog now-hang
 on and keep all eyes open-and i hope it
 will turn the trick

   it was night by the time he completed
 his dispositions and the brooding silence
 of the region broken only by the murmur
 from the forward cabin and the hiss of the
 current sweeping past the eagles sides did
 not help restore good spirits for a mo-
 mentas he leaned elbows on the texas deck
 rail and let himself peer into the blackness
 toward where he knew the north shore to
 be he let depression sweep over him then
 he bhook himself

never get anywhere by moping he -



 muttered might as well be up and at
 em plenty to do yet before its time to
 rest

   he sought his cabin where the buoyant
 spirit of the soldiers as they busied them-
 selves making final preparations restored
 him to cheerfulness now that he was in
 the dark as to blakes plans he was loath
 to let them go but nothing that had hap-
 pened had made his campaign against the
 turnbulls seem less sound so with inward
 trepidation he watched the squad embark
 in the eagles two small boats and saw
 them swallowed up by darkness

   by now though it was fairly early by
 the clock nearly everyone had turned in
 a glance in the forward cabin showed it
 almost empty save for two or three card
 games at the tables neither jake nor
 oacsby was in sight it was time for the
 crowning step in his preparations-crip-
 pling the party on board by arresting their
 leader jake

   he commenced by turning out the first
 mate smith with orders to get a reliable
 deckhand and join him on the forward end
 of the cabin deck that done he repaired
 to the appointed spot and waited until two
 shadowy forms approached through the
 darkness

  ready capn smith retorted
whatll we do now

   follow me andy said halt when
 i tell you then close in when i call or whis-
 tle and keep quiet as death meantime
 one peep out of any of youll spoil every-
 thing

   he led the little party aft in the star-
 board alleyway until near jakes cabin
 where he signed to them to stop as he
 did so his watchman on that side drew
 near a poised pistol showing dimijy
 through the darkness in his hand he re-
 placed it in his belt upon recognizing them
 and after a whispered word resumed pa-
 troling while captain andy tiptoed the
 rest of the way to jakes cabin

   the cabin when he reached it pre-
 sented closed door and blinds with only 
 tiny spot of light winking through the key
 hole captain andy considered-then ap-
 plied his car after all it was fair enough
 to learn what he might be running into
 and then he had slim ground for arresting
 jake-just oatsbys story which might or
 might not be true and his own conjectures
 it would be helpful if he could hear some-
 thing that would justify his action before
 taking it

   a confused murmur was his only re-

 uring

ward at first then jakes voice came
clear

  well you dont have to come along
youre in the clear now and you can take
to your bunk or run to the captain when
the shooting starts we dont want you
around anyway we need men in this
business-not white-livered sneaks
captain andy could not make sene out
of the snarling reply neither could he tell
what member of the gang was being al-
lowed to drop out but one point had been
gained jakes one remark had been
enough to sweep away any doubt about the
coming foray

  then out of the murmur jakes voice
came again charged with ugliness this
time

  get out ive heard all the whinin im
goin to listen to im goin to bed and i
dont want to see you till the jobs done
the inner door opened and shut that
meant andy figured that jake was alone
a sound as of a heavy man seating himself
on his bunk followed by puffing and curs-
ing as though jake were pulling off one of
his high boots lent color to the notion

  this was the moment andy wanted
taking a skeleton key from his pocket he
slipped it quietly into the lock he gath-
ered himself for a rush turned the key and
flung the door wide in practically one mo-
tion and stepped in swinging the door
closed behind himself

  evening jake he said u spose you
werent expecting me

  jake as captain andy had thought had
been seated on the edge of his bunk pulling
off a boot now he looked up and tried to
rise but realized that with the hoot half
off he couldnt be up in time to accomplish
anything glaring he settled back

  i wasnt he growled giving the boot a
final tug and flinging it aside and i
spose you think its o k to horn in with-
out being asked

  captain andys face set

  i wouldnt with any decent passenger
he retorted but with you its different
ive come to tell you the jig is up

  jakes face showed a flash of fright
then flooded crimson he rose now and
backed into a corner

  what jig he demanded with a touch
of bluster dont go talking any riddles
to me

  cut it out jake andy snapped i
know all about you and the turnbulls and
im going to clean out the bunch of you
so youd just as well not try bluffing and

im going to start by locking you up to-
night

  then tomorrow morning when your
gang shows up im going to have you
ready to greet them-with one of my men
on each side to blow your head off if you
dont do as youre told what youll do is
tell them the games up and theyd better
surrender peaceful

  now pick up what you want for to-
night and march

  for a moment jake tried to face it out
but andys cold contemptuous stare told
that it would be no use sullenly jake
turned to pack and captain andy relaxed
his vigilance

hat was a mistake
quick as a flash jake
jumped and the impact
took both to the floor
jake on top the gam-
bler seized andys
throat with one hand
and with the other
reached for a knife

  andy could hear men running outside
and knew that smith his helper and the
watchman had come up but they did not
enter and he realized that they would not
unless he could free himself enough to
call he must go it alone-and only a sec-
ond or so would pass before the issue
would be decided

  now jake rose a bit propping himself
against the hand on andys throat the
movement cut off all breath  but likewise it
gave andy his chance gathering all his
strength he jerked sidewise the move-
ment brought him free and he fought to
rise

  but to his surprise jake with a gurg-
ling cry fell limp writhed then lay shud-
dering on the floor leaping to his feet
andy saw the reason his own movement
had upset jake and the latter rolling over
had fallen on his own knife the fight
was over as quickly as it had started

  andy saw that jake had flung the knife
free before collapsing and he picked it up
that done he called bringing the men
from outside at sight of jake they stared
then looked questioningly at their skipper
as he stood holding the weapon

  its his andy explained he fell on
it while we were scuffling tell you more
later but now youd better take him to my
cabin call that doctor in stateroom 
and tell him to wait with jake still i get
there ill be along in a few minutes

  he watched them carry jake out then
the cross and double cross



started searching the room but now he
had little heart for it thanks to the scuf-
fle and its outcome his plans had gone
badly wrong jake couldnt be used now
to warn the others off neither was the
alternative-massing men in readiness to
meet the onslaught-advisable that would
warn off everybody and defeat his pur-
pose of scotching the turnbulls for good
and all there was nothing for it now but
to fight both gangs at once

  we can do it though he told himself
and we will-

  he broke off as he espied something
white protruding from the pocket of a coat
hung on a hook it was a letter envelope
without address or postmark evidently a
note for personal delivery

  stepping to the light andy withdrew
the enclosure and read it it was was with-
out superscripture and exceedingly short
as follows

  remember peabody i have your boy
and whether you sec him or not after this
depends on whether you come clean one
false step on your part and ill blow on
that marietta jab of yours which will put
your neck in the noose sure if ever yon
turn up in civilisation so be sure you
come clean	b

  captain andy whistled

  thats something anyway he mut-
tered its blakes writing thats lus
b sure nough so theres a peabody in
it and theyve got a hold on him won-
der who he is

  he tapped the letter pondering then
shrugged

  therell be time enough later to figure
that out better finish here and get on to
see how jakes coming

  he placed the letter in his wallet and re-
sumed his search but after half an hour
he gave up save for the letter the cabin
had yielded nothing that would throw light
on blakes scheme and there was nothing
further he could pry into he extin-
guished the lamp stepped out and locked
the door

  and that he thought can be put
down as my second fool stunt this trip
might better have left things as they were
iessn this letter turns out to be some-
thing and if jake dies well have a mess
next port we make on top of all this other
trouble

  but trouble from jakes death he
learned would not be added the doctor

who was waiting in andys cabin said that
the wound while crippling would not
prove fatal provided jake was given rest
and care if given a steward to help he
was willing he said to see the first night
through

  i suppose this fellow got into a brawl
captain he went on figured that was
how hed end up after his actions today
by the way i want to thank you for the
why youve handled this trouble its beer
splendid

  oh thats part of the work andy an-
swered nervously no one could run a
boat without being able to handle things
like that not on this river anyhow as to
jake you guessed it tell you more about
it tomorrow but i wonder could you tel
me one thing  do you know anyone among
the passengers named peabody

  it was a wild shot andy knew it as he
asked the question peabody if he were
aboard undoubtedly would have an alias
and so it seemed from the doctors an-
swer

  no i dont what sort of a fellow is
he

  i dont know him andy stated slowly
all i know is the name but i judge hes
some kind of a crook-someone with a bad
record

  peabody-peabody- the doctor mut-
tered then brightened you dont mean
the counterfeiter isaac peabody whos
wanted in ohio thin fellow short mid-
dle aged sharp as a gimlet and sly as all
get out they had papers out for him
when we left st louis

  andy shook his head

  couldnt say as to that not knowing
him well ive got a lot to do tonight
and id better be getting on well talk
about it tomorrow

  peabody a counterfeiter-it was strange
andy thought as he went to send the stew-
ard requested by the doctor how counter-
feiting kept crossing the trail it bore out
his guess at blakes scheme-renewed it
even though his ideas had been proved
wrong at the time of the fight in the cabin
he snorted in disgust

  youve had bright ideas enough for one
day andy corbin he chided himself
and youve muffed twice because of them
cut it out now and tend to business

  with that admonition he turned out the
steward sent him on his way and joined
harker to spend the night jumping when-
ever a board creaked or the thud of a
drifting tree against the packets side made
him think the attack had come


frontier stories

hen the first gray flush
of visibility was paling
the stars and thinning
the velvety blackness
over the eastward tree
tops andy yawned
shook harker into
wakefulness and
sought the deck the nipping rawness of
the misty dawn air felt good after the
lamp-lit stuffiness of the little cabin and
revived his zest for action he visited his
sentinels on the cabin deck found them
sleepy but alert then sought the cargo deck

  here the tenseness of the cabin deck
had no counterpart the watchman sup-
posed to be on duty in the prow had rolled
himself in a blanket anil was sleeping
peacefully regardless of the dewy dia-
monds which sprinkled his covering the
deckhands burly lawless fellows who
ranked next to the indians and bandits as
terrors of the river looked harmless as
they snored comfortably in the warm space
between the raised boilers and the cargo
deck even the fireman who theoretically
was awake maintaining steam leaped from
a doze to inspect his gages when andy ap-
proached all these at least would be
fresh when the fighting started an hour or
two after sunup

  by novv gray light was permeating the
forest the moldy night smell was pass-
ing and the birds were beginning to cheep
s they shook themselves awake in the
east a few lines of pink were streaking
the sky it was time to rouse the mates
and get the eagle going with a last look
about andy hastened to the texas deck

  shake a leg he admonished smith and
his partner as he tumbled them out
were going to have a fight in about an
hour-with the turnbulls

  both mates bounded from their bunks
demanding particulars wtiile they dressed
andy explained including the story of the
money then he sent them to get breakfast
and launch preparations for the encounter
within ten minutes an excited crew was
ashore casting off mooring lines and bring-
ing aboard the last bit of wood that could
be stowed while others started building a
barricade of cargo along the starboard side
another ten minutes and the paddle
wheels began churning sending the eagle
up-stream to whatever fate might hold in
store for her

  meanwhile andy over a cup of coffee
was giving instructions to harker
m you stay in your cabin he said un-
til the rumpus forward is over and keep

the office locked and your pistols ready

  then when weve got things quieted on
board you can come out and look to the
passengers-excepting whatever turnbull
men we may be holding better get every-
one else back in the womens cabin proba-
bly be safer there

  oh but i say harker protested id
like to be in this you know

  of course you would andy replied
but id rather not have you you arent
on to such affairs yet and you might pot
one of our men as easy as a turnbull
no youll help more staying here than
tending to the passengers-to say nothing
of that being your job anyway

  lie finished his coffee and left for the
cargo deck a few of the passengers were
up and about now and andy noticed that
ail of them classed among the toughest cus-
tomers aboard undoubtedly they were
turnbull men portents of the coming
storm

  nodding in response to a dour greeting
or two he passed through and lelow to
where the first mate was waiting with a
group of expectant deckhands

  ready sir the mate reported ive
issued pistols as you ordered

  the remark was superfluous as the
butts of the double-barreled derringers
were peeping from the waistbands of the
men andys hand strayed to his pocket
lo touch one of his two six-shot colts-
the only spedmen oe the new guns on
board so far as he knew-and he glanced
from one to another of the grinning eager
faces before him they were true mis-
souri river deck hands all of them never
so happy as when in a fight and andys
confidence mounted

  its our day men he told them and
the whole riverll be talking about how we
cleaned them but dont go starting any-
thing till i give the word

  ill be somewhere above when the
shooting starts at the first shot come
up and jump in same as we did last night
but be careful who you shoot and dont
shoot at all unless you have to fists will
do better and you can swing them well
enough the pistols are just for emer-
gency if someone gets you down or draws
on you most of our shooting will be done
outboard

  a shrill hoot from the whistle inter-
rupted and all glanced up the river the
eagle was heading southwest now to work
around a massive bluff jutting out from
the north shore when she rounded the
point and headed northwest spring land-
the cross and double cross



ing would be visible about half a mile
ahead on the starboard side the whistle
was the customary warning that she was
coming and it was time for andy to be at
his battle post

  darting aft he scrambled out a window
grasped the edge of the deck above and
hauled himself up to the little gallery out-
side the after cabins disdaining cere-
mony he dashed through one of these
through the womens cabin and into the
corridor leading forward past harkers
office there he lingered in the shadows
listening breathlessly for the signal that
would start him into action

  for a few minutes the eagle swept on
her paddles beating in the rhythm of full
speed then a swing perceptible enough
to a seasoned veteran like captain andy
told that she was rounding the headland
and a faint tinkle below marked the signal
stand by for the landing

  another tinkle and the engines slowed
to half speed a minute or two passed
minutes that seemed eternities-a shout
forward-and andy knew that a heaving
line had been thrown out another min-
ute-the engines churned in a furious burst
of paddling then stopped the eagle was
being made fast to the bank and then
punctuating the silence came the crack of
a rifle shot then another and then a
fusillade the battle was on at last

 v

t the first shot andy
leaped forward simul-
taneously a man ap-
peared at the end of the
corridor for one re-
vealing instant in which
time seemed standing
still the man was mo-
tionless then his arm rose but andy
fired and the man fell andy leaped over
him and roaring defiancc lunged against
the full impact of the gangs rush

  instantly he was striking two three
ways at once-firing with one hand swing-
ing with another kicking at anything
brushing him a pistol butt cracked down
on his head he gave under it whirling as
he did so and came up with an uppercut to
the jaw of his assailant a shove sent the
limp form crashing into the mob behind
a gorilla-like sweep of the captains long
right arm sent another after him and
andy found himself in a little clearing

  one pistol was lost now and the other
empty hurling it into the mob ahead he
followed diving under and rearing up to

spill two more again he plunged keep-
ing always in the thick of them carrying
the battle to them denying them the
chance to use knife or bullet in the press
of bodies

  for a space of minutes he was irresisti-
ble master of everything then even his
giant strength began to flag he rallied
rushed again but now he knew that help
was needed where were smith and his
men why werent they in it long ago
would they never come

  the roar of musketry outside gave the
answer beat it into his surcharged brain
even through the red battle lust the for-
ward gangway was swept by bullets
smiths men couldnt come the fight was
up to him and him alone

  gritting his teeth he rallied for his last
plunge he made it spilled a man-felt a
pin prick in his back a knife had touched
him finally-

  a thudding impact on his back drove
him to his knees he lunged up felt the
knife again went down once more they
were getting the upper hand would beat
him down unless help came

  a shout burst into his numbing brain-a
shout and the reverberation of a charge
that rallied his waning strength he leaped
to his feet glanced about for a head to hit
-and saw his men go sweeping past cut
off forward they had scrambled up the
port side and assailed the mob from the
after cabin as he had done

  he leaped forward but the fight was
over here as he reached his men they
had cornered the remaining gangsters jam-
med them in a helpless mass against the
side of the cabin and were dragging them
forth one by one into custody of the guard
smith was forming

  but cessation of the fight made the fir-
ing outside deafening now the victory
still was scarce half complete the gang
on land might yet turn the scale

  allowing himself one glance about the
cabin andy scuttled into a starboard state-
room brushed aside the pistol presented by
the frightened occupant and leaped to the
window a moment lapsed while he
focused his spinning gaze a task made
more difficult by the drifting powder
smoke then the situation stood revealed

  his own men as he had planned were
safe firing through loop-holes they had ar-
ranged in the cargo barricade the turn-
bulls their first rush checked by the
eagles readiness had dismounted and like-
wise taken cover behind the woodpiles scat-
tered about the little clearing it was stale-


frontier stories

   mate each side unable to move against the
   fire of the other

but the eagle held the key to the situa-
tion in the soldiers unless tompkins had

slipped up eagerly andy scanned the bluff
to see evidence of the sergeant and his men

   as he did several spurts of flame flecked
the hillside some seconds passed then
another volley came now captain andy
understood and his heart wenr out to
tompkins the seasoned non-com wise in
the rough-and-tumble fighting of the coun-
try had done the best thing possible he
had waited for the turnbulls to spend their
first enthusiasm and settle into the strain
of sustained combat and now he was pick-
ing them off when they could least stand
something unexpected

   a hand clapped on andys shoulder and
he whirled to see smith panting but
grimly triumphant

   we got em the first mate reported
sitting in a row and men to shoot em if
they bat an eyelash all except three you
did in for keeps and some more too groggy
to sit up whatll we do next

  how many men can you spare andy
shot back

   five i guess maybe six replied the
mate

   bring them below then after me we
can use the stairs now when were all
together well rush down

  a moment sufficed to form the little
group at the forward door and andy
cocked an ear to listen tompkins diver-
sion was effective no bullets were whis-
tling now he whipped open the door
leaped down the stairs and into the shelter
of the cargo the others trooping after

  by now the fight was nearly over as
andy glanced through an opening he saw
several turnbulls leap from behind wood-
piles and scurry for the brush a volley
from the hillside dropped two then eight
gray-clad figures rose from the brush and
poising bayonet-tipped muskets canne pour-
ing down the hill at them the gangsters
quailed wheeled and headed for the boat

   that was the chance for the eagles men
swarming around the sides of the barri-
cade they leaped to the shore clubbed their
guns and charged their erstwhile assail-
ants but the ruffians had had enough
they and the others left unhit behind the
woodpiles dropped to their knees held up
their hands and the fight was over

  now two tasks remained for andy the
passengers about whose ears this hurri-
cane had burst so unexpectedly must be
reassured and the safety of the banks

money must be established leaving
tompkins and the others to secure the
prisoners andy hurried back to discharge

these duties

  one job however did not arise on
rounding the corner into the corridor past
the pursers office andy met harker the
englishman leaped forward and wrung the
hand of his burly chief

  wonderful gigantic he burbled a
regular waterloo pen my word dont
see how you did it single-handed for three
minutes if it was a second gainst that
mob

  andy grinning in embarrassment
wrenched his hand loose

  theres still work to do hie said
how are the passengers

  harkers gesture dismissed the passen-
gers	

  quite all right he said most of
them stuck to their cabins those that
didnt i herded aft theyre there now
buzzing it over dont worry about them
all right then andy said theres
still one thing i hope you havent forgot-
ten were still responsible for that money
you know

  harker stared

  of course he answered but why fret
about it i was with it all through the
fight and heres the door still locked just
as i left it

  doesnt mean anything andy growled
this fight wasnt the only string to
blakes bow you know remains to be
seen if hes pulled another while we were
busy

  still unconcerned harker opened the
door and the two stepped in the strong
box was in place apparently all right just
as it had been after the affray of the night
before somewhat reassured they opened
it the money still was inside in order

  you see harker queried its all
right and safe enough look here it is
the packets of small bills on top just as we
had them when we counted them in heres
a pack of tens and here are twenties and
here under them is the first pack of hun-
dreds-

  suddenly he cursed and plunged both
hands into the box for a few frantic mo-
ments he dug as a terrier digs into a hill-
side giving each packet a bare instants
scrutiny before flinging it aside when he
had worked well into the heap he paused
and glanced up with ashen face

  this-this is terrible he gasped
right when wed licked them too we
thought this chap hadnt done anything last
the cross and double cross



flight but we were wrong except for the
top packets this money is-is counterfeit

ounterfeit  the
echo came from the
door like a whipcrack
captain andy and har-
ker whirled to see
smith and tompkins
standing there scarcely
able to believe what they
had heard smith knowing the story of
the money had let out the exclamation
and as they stepped in he explained to
tompkins then the members of the lit-
tle group stared at each other white faced
and silent

  all that is but captain andy for the
moment the others thought he had gone
crazy instead of showing consternation
his face was lighting with joyl

  counterfeit he exclaimed jumped
for the box and verified the pronounce-
ment then he whipped about flung his
cap to the ceiling and seizing the
astounded harker by the arms began
dancing about the cabin

  counterfeit sure enough he chortled
and that makes everything right as it
should be my notion was right and were
out of the woods in fine shape now

  he stopped and grinned at the three
whose countenances plainly showed their
dumb amazement then he pointed at
harker and let out a roar of laughter

  you dont see it yet he chuckled
after all the time youve had to think
about it but it means blakes shot his
bolt now-got rid of the last arrow in his
quiver-and we can catch up the man who
did it so its all clear sailing now just
watch me clean things up

  he dashed into the corridor all three of
them and to their amazement turned not
forward to assail one of the prisoners but
aft toward the womens cabin about half-
way he stopped and hammered on one of
the cabin doors

  open up there he bellowed open
up before i kick the door in 

  harker identified the cabin as that occu-
pied by the farmer oatsby-then jumped
as a muffled shot sounded from within
captain andy leaped aside then reached
forward one long arm and pounded his
fist on the door again

  come on he called no more funny
business or ill wring your neck

  the answer to that was another shot
andy stood motionless body and arm out
of range until it had sounded then he

leaped to a position before the door hurled
his bulk against it and burst in there
was a momentary scuffle followed by si-
lence  then andys voice rang out

  come on he called catch him when
i toss him out

  harker and tompkins reached the door
just as oatsby bent almost double cata-
pulted between them fetching his head a
resounding thwack against the opposite
wall as he wavered from the stunning
shock they seized him jerked him upright
and tompkins held him pinned against the
wall

  ive got him nailed he grunted see
to the captain harker

  no need a cheery voice called and
andy appeared in the door a bulky object
in his hands after one glance harker
gasped with joy it was a duplicate of the
strong box which had contained the banks
money but andy blocked his attempt
to seize it

  wait he directed and take that fel-
low to ycur office he nodded at the pin-
ioned oatsby well straighten out every-
thing up there

  within a few moments they were com-
fortably disposed-all except oatsby who
was held in a comer by tompkins and
harker key poised at the strong box
andy had retrieved

  all right andy said open up and
lets see whats what

  in a trice the box was open and they
were peering eagerly inside it was filled
with money in regular stacks just as the
other was plunging his hand into the
middle of the mass harker drew forth a
packet riffled it and handed it to andy
the latter examined a few bills then
smiled

  right he said this is good money
the real money just as we put it in back
there in st louis oatsby here was clev-
erer than we thought figured there
mightnt be time i spose to switch the
money so he had a duplicate box and just
switched boxes contents and all and he
had brains enough to salt the top of his box
with real money in case we looked into it
blake fixed tilings at the bank ill bet so
that the cashier would hand us the packets
of small bills last the way he did that
would bring them on top and itd cost
least to duplicate them for the fake box
hes a canny player that fellow blake i
tell you

  he wragged his head solemnly as he
stared at oatsby then reached forward
suddenly seized the little farmer by the


frontier stories

coat collar and hauled him into the middle
of the room

  and now gentlemen he said his old-
time twinkle in his eyes we might as well
clean up the last mystery this fellow
passes as oatsby the farmer but seeins
how hes given us so much worry we
might as well know him right

  sudden pressure from his clutching paw
at oatsbys neck forced the startled pris-
oner into a grotesque bow with the little
man in that position andy waved a hand
toward him in the manner of a showman
displaying an oddity

  so gentlemen he concluded his
speech i want you to meet isaac pea-
body the slickest counterfeiter in seven
states those bills were samples of his
handiwork made to order i have  doubt
for this scheme

  he handed oatsby-or peabody as he
now stood revealed-back to the custody
of tompkins took a seat and leaned back
in comfort

  and that he said is the end of the
eagles troubles for this voyage

  but wait a minute exclaimed harker
how did you figure it all out i can see
now it was this counterfeit scheme you had
in mind but how did you guess it at the
start

  it came easy-even if slow andy an-
swered you see i started thinking it
wasnt natural that blaked rest with just
hoping the turnbulls would polish us off
that wasnt thorough enough for him by
half and i couldnt see him arranging to
let anyone else get away with half a mil-
lion dollars without trying to get a good-
sized cut of it himself so i figured hed
have a catch in it somewhere for his bene-
fit

  another thing i noticed was jake help-
ing this mans wife aboard by the way
harker scout up one of the women pas-
sengers to see to her will you she must
be wild by now poor thing-married to a
crook like this one too you can tell her
maybe it will be all right though ive just

got an idea-

  harker left and peabody his compos-
ure suddenly collapsed spoke up

  what dyuh mean all right he de-
manded hoarsely wrhat are you-

  never mind captain andy snapped
i mean all right for you-a better break
than youve got a right to expect keep
still and ill tell you in good time but ill
say now i know about your youngster and
im willing not to make things worse for
him

  peabody though haggard with anxiety
took the hint to be silent and all waited
until harker returned

  shes cared for he announced wild
to know whats going to happen but i told
her wed let her know now what about
jake helping these people

ell it wasnt like jake
nohow andy resumed
i couldnt see why he
did it lessn they was in
cahoots that looked
moren likely when each
one got busy stirring up
a crowd to fightin heat
soons they got aboard

  then came the fake row at the bar and
this fellow tellin me about the turnbulls
leastwise i thought the row was a fake
put up to turn suspicion from this fellow
likewise it gave him a chance to work in
good with me by telling me bout the raid
i was willing to believe that he wouldnt
tell me a story that would turn out to be a
fake next day

  then too smith broke in maybe
they didnt care whether you knew or not
figured with jake on board you couldnt
stop the turnbulls no matter what you
did

  quite likely andy said but there
was more to it than that blake may
have figured we couldnt lick the turn-
bulls  but the way he had tilings fixed he
didnt care whether we did or not he had
us caught fore and aft no matter which
way things went-as i saw when jakes
fool stunt of spending one of their coun-
terfeits put me on the track

  he broke off sobered momentarily by
thought of the trap then went on

  yes sir if the raid went over wed
he done and blakes mand have the real
money with everyone thinking the turn-
bulls had got it if the raid fizzled and we
got through all right tire banks agent
would find himself stung with counterfeit
everyoned think we made the switch and
still blakes man would have the money
without suspicion pointing at him a
clever scheme im telling you

  and heres something else harker ex-
claimed your helping this fellow against
jake would hurt when we got to iowa with
the money someone would get on to his
being peabody and since you helped him
everyone would think you and he were act-
ing together

  captain andy slapped his thigh and
laughed
the cross and double cross

  never thought of that he said hut
the points a good one score another one
for blake

  well when i got the idea i figured
someone would be in to switch the money
as soon as the room was empty and thats
when i bet you the ten harker the cap-
tain resumed but you know how he
fooled us on that by putting out the light
but the real fooler was having his box
salted with real money on the top that
took us in harker lock stock and
barrel

  still i couldnt get over the idea
somehow when i found this letter in
jakes room- he produced the missive
and passed it around continuing after all
had read it- and later the surgeon told
me peabody was a counterfeiter the no-
tion came back strong as ever i figured
then the switch would come later that was
all so i let everything go ahead and the
rest you know

  silence fell for a moment while they
stared at each other digesting the story
peabody was the first to speak

  captain he croaked hoarse with anx-
iety captain-a word please theres

the missus and tliat boy of ours you know

about that blakes got-

yes captain andy queried as all
eyes focused on the prisoner want to
know whats going to happen with you
peabody nodded and all waited to hear
andys pronouncement

  well heres how it is gentlemen he
said we could send blake over the road
for his share in this job but blake has a
crowd with him and sending him over
wouldnt keep them quiet so i thirk wed
do better to keep this as a sort of club-
sort of a peace bond if you like

  as long as blake behaves well keep
still about this the minute he or any of
his crowd turns a hand well let loose our
story produce a confession im sure pea-
body sign and thats the finish of mr
blake so hell keep quiet and keep his
crowd off us too but to do it that way
well have to let peabody go if we turned
him in it would show our hand

  you might say its a case of their tryin
to cross us and we double-crossing them
cross and double-cross-fair enough and
it means an end to worry about blake and
all his crowd long as were on the river

inventions of the
eskimo

by donald a cadzow

when the average person thinks of
an eskimo he pictures in his mind
a short squat lazy individual sitting on a
cake of ice chewing a piece of raw blub-
ber but to the arctic traveler who has
lived in the snow houses of these people
and has trusted his life to them time and
time again they present a very different
picture he knows them as a clever hu-
man and interesting people their snow
houses are feats of engineering and the
principle of the arch used in building these
has rarely been developed independently
by mankind in the history of the world
the only other primitive people to devise it

were the mediterranean sea etruscans

  the snow-goggle made of wood with a
narrow slit to look through and used to
prevent snowblindness is an eskimo in-
vention now being used to prevent kleig
eyes by motion picture directors

 the stone lamp burning seal oil and
moss invented by these people centuries
ago lias made possible their occupancy of
an otherwise uninhabitable region it is
interesting to note that the only other place
that the wick lamp was used by primitive
people was also in the neighborhood of the
mediterranean
newsom comes back

to many of our readers it is suffi-
cient announcement of the next issue
to say that j d newsom will be on hand
again with another foreign legion novel-
ette the foreign legion way will take
its place among the best stories he has
given us a tale of north africa of the
vainglorious kaid of djel-hamadah of a
clever and unscrupulous woman who bends
him easily to play her game-and of the
foreign legion that pays in blood to set-
tle the score yes its a barbour and dag-
liev story

  opening the next issue will be another
of j e grinsteads western classics the
great red border a complete novel of
trail-herd days in frontier texas and one
of the shootinest grinsteads yet a tur-
bulent section indeed was the great red
border the banks of the red river that
separated the law-abiding country of
texas from the hazardous domain of rus-
tlers and outlaws on the north it is a
typical grinstead yarn-which means that
you can taste the dust of the trail in your
throat and feel the breeze of the bullets
as they speed on their destructive way

  l patrick greene will be on hand with
another dynamite drury novelette en-
titled whitewash among the other
regulars will be eugene cunningham with
another story about young ware the texas
ranger warren hastings miller with
another adventure of bruce romney in
the burma secret service charles gil-
son with a story about the virile cinder-
face and the proposition he faces in distant
china james k waterman with another
of his stirring whaling stories and an-

thony m rud with a gun-shooting west-
ern tale besides these there will be sev-
eral newcomers who stack right up with
the old-timers and whom we feel you will
be glad to meet all that next time

 advice to claim-jumpers

jake ender in robert v carrs
king of the thundering bar in
this issue seems to locate half the creek
on which he made his strike while to our
notion one is limited in the number of
claims he may stake so we asked mr
carr about it-and drew a mighty inter-
esting reply

  how many placer claims may a man lo-
cate he answers i have not had time
to question a government official and am
not posted on recent rulings but recent
rulings do not apply to my story king
of the thundering bar during the pe-
riod of which i have written we located as
many placer claims as we pleased and held
them as long as we performed the proper
amount of assessment work

  in some cases miners imde their own
laws and limited the size and number of
claims one man might hold but ordi-
narily in the old days a man located any
number he desired i located and held
placer claims when i was a miner as
long as i performed the assessment work
my rights were respected

  forest reserves and the increasing pa-
ternalism of the government have thrown
the old free customs aside in the old days
a prospector simply put up a discovery
notice and recorded his claim with the reg-
ister of deeds today if the ground is in
a forest reserve he is subject to the ap-


the trading post



proval or disapproval of the forest officer
in the old days he was subject only to his
own wishes

  in the days of king of the thunder-
ing bar prospectors were an independent
set and extremely jealous of their rights
and liberties if one found a creek that
suited him he might locate a string of
twenty placer claims that was his creek
and other prospectors so regarded it he
was not crowded with legal exactions if
he failed to do the assessment work no
old-timer would think of jumping his
claims any more than an old-time cowman
would think of intruding on another cow-
mans range law or no law that sort of
thing wasnt done by the old-timers cus-
tom was stronger than any law or red tape
the man who thought he could invade
some old-timers domain with a set of law
books might find himself dodging lead
if he stopped a bullet there were no
mourners

  i knew of rich placer ground held year
after year by old-timers without doing the
proper amount of assessment work but
they were in possession they had been
there for years it was their ground and
only a fool would think of jumping it if
some featherhead obsessed with the idea
of the power of the law tried to jump the
claims he could expect to do some per-
sonal jumping unless he desired to curl
up around a hunk of lead

  even now there are places in the west
where a claim-jumper though loaded down
with law would be riddled with lead be-
fore he got started i know of one old
boy on the desert who has about two hun-
dred acres of dry placer he hasnt per-
formed enough assessment work on the
claims to hold one legally but i am not go-
ing to jump his claims if i had the claim-
jumpers itch i would not jump them if
i had three or four sheriffs with me i
would not jump them why well as
long as he lived the old boy would hunt
me sooner or later he would get me he
would not care where he got me either on
broadway the highway the desert or
down on my knees in church sooner or
later he would plug me

  when questioning a mans rights as
to number of claims and the proper
amount of assessment work it is best if
there is any jumping idea in the head to
ascertain if the prospector is an old-timer
or not i f he is an old-timer lay all ques-
tions of law aside and refrain from jump-
ing his ground this is  but lead
travels just as fast as it did in  i

had men in my camp on the mojave who
reminded me of the old-timers i knew
when i was a ten-year-old hard men
not afraid to die any moment for what
they consider their rights they hold
groups of placer and quartz claims i
have never felt the slightest desire to ques-
tion their claims i do not think enough
of any kind of a claim to stop a hunk of
lead for it those desert rats would shoot
i dont know but what i would shoot too
if some law-sharp thought to take advan-
tage of the fact that i had failed o do my
assessment work at least i hope i would
not lie down and say please take my
ground mister 

 down to the sea in ships

ouite a different crowd from carrs
old-timers are the hardy fellows who
go down to the sea in ships yet who
can say which type is the more interesting
-especially when the sailor crowd are in-
troduced and interpreted by one who
knows them so well as s b h hurst
author of the son of a sea cook in
this issue

   the son of a sea cook is a tale of
the frontier i know best-the sea-and of
the last of the pioneers th sailors of the
sailing ships mr hurst writes it is
a true picture of those iron men with the
souls of big children their ways were
not the ways of the sea of today they
lacked education and like tuttles famous
cowmen they also lacked decorum but
they were men and many pharisees who
would feel contaminated by associating
with them would cling to them crying
when in need i may say that it would
be as impossible to write of the old sail-
ors without bringing in what most of them
lived and worked for-whisky-as it
would be impossible to give a picture of
the old wrest without doing the same

  yet again i sometimes doubt if sail-
ors have changed living here near
bremerton a naval station i see many
men of the navy they are different in
this-they have excellent educations but
the other day i saw one bidding a tearful
farewell to a crack in the sidewalk be-
cause for some strange reason the crack
load interested him he was telling the
crack that he had to go back to his ship
tins is a fact-not fiction and i am cer-
tain that that sailor was a first class man-
like epictetus in my story no constitu-
tional amendment can alter the result of
thousands of years of evolution-can

from far-off burma

after reading two or three of war-
ren hastings millers stories it is un-
necessary to tell you that mr miller has
been there and knows very much of a
globe-trotter is miller with a penchant for
little known places and a delight for squat-
ting down and living with strange peoples
which of course is why the feel of the
country impregnates all his work as it
does dayong gets mislaid his story in
this issue

  i have long wanted to stage a story on
shwe dagon the great golden pagoda
of rangoon mr miller says of the set-
ting of this tale i was fortunate in be-
ing one of the last white men to see it be-
fore the edict forbidding it to whites went
forth montagu the british secretary for
the colonies granted it to the pongyis and
it caused a lot of growling in burma as
giving the natives one more inch whereat
they would promptly take an ell the
thing was qualified by permitting a white
man to go up native-that is barefoot-
but no sahib could do that with dignity

i	dont think it has been changed since my
time tourists and steamship companies
probably growl a lot but the pongyis dont
want them rubbering around the temples
and thats the gist of it

the mail pouch

that readers keep a keen eye on the
physical makeup of the magazine as

well as its reading content is evidenced by
the following letter

editor frontier stories

dear sir-

  i have just finished reading the march issue of
frontier stokies and am eagerly waiting for
the next copy it seems to me that i am always
waiting for the next months issue in fact l
wish it were a semi-monthly so that it would
not be so long to wait in between times

  there are several things that endear me to
frontier stories to begin with it has every
story complete-no serials to break off in the
middle of the climax to leave one biting finger-
nails and worrying or cussing the author until
the next issue darn all serials anyway next
the contents page is one to be proud of it tells
in a clear concise way what to expcct and
makes you feel as if you can hardly wait to start
the reading itself then the paper and printing
itself both which are the life of any maga-
zine the type and reading in frontier stories
is not equaled in any other magazine printed
finally we come right down to the heart of the
magazine itself the stories and the authors tlie
stories cannot be improved upon-

  my favorite author i have never had the
pleasure of reading in frontier stories but i
hope to some day and when i do i know i will
feel as if it is too good to be true the man i
would like to meet in frontier stories is w
c tuttle and i hope you get him on your pay-
roll or writers role or whatever it is that yotl
get authors to do of the frontier stories
authors honest i liave never been able to make
a choice first its newsom then along comes
grinstead and i change my mind along comes
ware i get settled or think i am and you
liave to go and give us cunningham and i start
all over again if you ever have a popularity
contest for authors i hope you blow up because
i am sure i am not the only one who would not
know which way to vote

  hope i liave not bored you with my summing
up of frontier stories the best magazine
printed success and everything i remain
sincerely
