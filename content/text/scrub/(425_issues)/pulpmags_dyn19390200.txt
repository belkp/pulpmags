in the crystal room

hannibal fairchild

spratt the seventh the sole
surviving heir of the great
spratt-fairchild dynasty and the ruler

of alltranerica formerlyamerica sat
in the crystal room of his castle above
the hudson through the clear glitter-
ing walls of a dome-shaped chamber
that arched two hundred feet above
him the winter sun shone in remote
chilly splendor the rays filtering in
as through a layer of ice gave a bluish
rather ghostly complexion to spratt as
he idled in his cushioned chair they
lent a cold accentuation to the baldness

machines towered to a height of thirty and forty feet-and


before each unit stood a figure fantastic beyond belief

tranerica

 of his polished pate to the outlines of
 his pallid puffy face and knob-like
 chin and to his stumpy form arrayed in
 a purple bejeweled toga-like robe

   with a yawn he slowly lifted himself
 out of his chair and ran his fingers
 across the keyboard of a five-foot ma-
 chine with something of the appearance
 of a greatly enlarged typewriter in-
 stantly a door to his rear slammed to a
 dose another door far in front of him
 turned outward a partition in the glass
 roof opened slightly admitting the
 outer air a wire along the wall began
 moving and bore a lighted cigarette al-
 most to his lips a paper came rattling
 in through a little tube and opened as
 though moved by invisible hands and
 -best of all for it brought a light to the
 rulers cloudy gray eyes-a tray with
 a decanter of some sparkling red liquid

by science-fictions best loved and best known satirist




dynamic science stories

glided in along two little rails placed
just above the floor

  as spratt sipped the beverage he
chanced to let his gaze rest on a large
printed sheet that cut off the light on a
segment of the glass wall a few yards
away by the blue lightnings he
muttered its time to turn a new leaf
and he pressed another key on the type-
writer-like instrument and a lever
reached out automatically and tore off
the printed sheet december 
 it had read but in its place ap-
peared a paper with the notation jan-
uary  -

  having finished his drink spratt
thrust the cigarette between his lips
and strolled listlessly across the room
he stared out through the wall-which
being  entirely of glass was like one
great continuous window-and saw the
river glistening fifteen hundred feet be-
low bordering the water on both
shores and reaching into the distance as
far as his somewhat dim sight could fol-
low he saw the gigantic black bulks of
the hives-those enormous buildings
which each a quarter of a mile high and
rectangular triangular or hexagonal in
shape had existed ever since the iron
renaissance of the twenty-second cen-
tury the eyes of the ruler as he
glanced out at those huge familiar struc-
tures scarcely noted how closely they
were packed together windowless and
forbidding or how in the narrow aisles
between them a darkness as of mid-
night reigned except when now and
then a light flashed and went out in
their vague depths like the signal lamp
of some soul astray in purgatory

opratt yawned once more and
looked bored a sigh came from be-
tween his heavy lips this business of
being a dictator isnt what it used to
be he reflected gloomily every-
thing runs so smoothly theres nothing
left for me to do why there hasnt

even been a revolt for seventy-five
years they say that dear old great-
granddad hannibal fairchild spratt
the fourth had a cracking good time
putting down the insurrection of the
mill robots but that was way back
in  then his father hanniabl fair-
child spratt the third had to liquidate
ten thousand conspirators who were
plotting against his life that was more
than a hundred years ago and before
that time the first two members of their
dynasty had to keep things humming
to cut down their enemies and stay on
their thrones but look at me noth-
ing to do but press buttons all day no
one would even think of questioning my
authority i dont have to issue com-
mands im obeyed automatically and
all the while im so weary of the whole
thing i often think of taking one long
jump into the hudson and ending it
all

  dismally the sovereign glanced down
at the waters still glittering in the
noonday sun despite the shadowing
towers that arose on all sides then ir-
resolutely he ambled away turned a
switch entered a little plush-lined car
that rolled in through a door which
opened as if of its own volition pulled
a second switch and went gliding away
through long steel-lined corridors as
he shot rapidly forward doors opened
before him and closed behind him with
perfectly timed reguarity although no
human operator was visible lights
gleamed and vanished the car turned
curves and descended grades although
the rider did nothing to guide it and fi-
nally it came to a halt in an immense
room marked science laboratory

  well might as well go on with my
experiments spratt reflected for he
had one great secret vice frequently
when bored with everything else in life
he would find amusement and relaxation
in his scientific investigations just now
he was on the trail of a discovery which
the loro of tran erica



he thought would startle even a century
that had all but lost the capacity for
enthusiasm

  the moment he entered the labora-
tory he was a transformed man with
something of an inventors natural
pride he glanced at the great machine
that towered above him with coils as
of monstrous exposed entrails and pro-
jecting pipes as of factory smokestacks
and tall dials and wires and wheels in-
tricately interwoven and a dark buzz-
ing something in his heart which might
have reminded one of a dynamo purr-
ing certainly the machine was unlike
anything else which existed even in the
mechanical twenty-fifth century and
spratt as he stared up at it forgot that
he was the head and ruler of all traner-
ica forgot all the monotony and ennui
of a dictators life forget everything ex-
cept that he was on the road to a great
scientific discovery

ur age has made marvelous
progress in its command of in-
visible rays he meditated as he
plunged a corkscrew-like steel device
down a long tube and caused a sheet of
red lightning to flash across the room
we have solved the problem of the dis-
tant control of moving cars doors ele-
vators aircraft and the like but in one
respect weve never gone very far for
the last five centuries our knowledge
of the fourth dimension has been con-
fined mostly to theory except of
course he added with a chuckle of
sly satisfaction as a wave of blue flame
crackled in front of him for my ma-
chine  

  its not perfect yet he went on
while his hands deftly manipulated a
lever but it takes advantage of a new
principle its evident that the rays of
the fourth dimension must impinge on
thoee of the third since all the universe
is really one at the point where they
impinge it may be possible to pass from

one dimension to the other this means
we may be able to shift to another posi-
tion in time since time as has been
brought out centuries ago is the fourth
dimension of space or on the other
hand we may bring objects out of some
other place in time into the year 
-no  well isnt that what ive
really done already

  while his fingers still pulled at the
levers of the machine spratt glanced
behind him to a great glass case where
a curious assortment of bric-a-brac had
been accumulated there was a frag-
ment of an old mouldy broken vase
bearing an etruscan inscription a
desiccated seven-foot bone which might
have belonged to a dinosaur a medi-
eval steel helmet badly eaten by rust
the shattered half of what looked a lit-
tle like a bronze buddha and-the
prize and crown of the collection-an
electric light bulb which may have
dated bade as far as the mid-twentieth
century its fractured antique filament
still distinctly visible in the glass inte-
rior

  with such objects already gathered
from the past by causing it to merge
with our own dimension reflected
spratt permitting himself an inventors
natural pride there is no telling where
we may not end yes i may yet be
known to the world as something more
worth-while than a dictator

  long and lovingly he peered at the
curios in his glass case-so long and
lovingly in fact that he may have be-
come a trifle careless his fingers moved
almost automatically among a great
array of switches and levers as numer-
ous as the keys on a piano and his eyes
did not closely follow what his hands
were doing accordingly he may have
pulled the wrong rod-at least this is
how he afterwards explained the mat-
ter to himself-with the result that
hannibal fairchild spratt the seventh
received the greatest shock that had


dynamic science stories

come to him in all his forty-nine years
on earth

  all at once the room seemed deluged
in a flood of leaping blue fire there
came a detonation as of exploding dy-
namite the upper portions of the di-
mension-machine flew apart and
crashed against the ceiling as if shot
out of a trench mortar the walls shook
the floor heaved like the deck of a ves-
sel pitching at sea and green and pur-
ple lights succeeded the blue in the split
fraction of a second then there came
the sound of heavy objects thudding
and finally while a rain of debris show-
ered to all parts of the room a cry as of
some being in agony came from the
depths of the shattered machine and
then by degrees all grew still

c tunned by the concussion spratt
k- picked himself up from a corner of
the room into which he had been prov-
identially hurled a fragment of flying
steel as long as his arm had missed his
head by less than the width of his small
finger yet he had not entirely escaped
injury his neatly shaven lower lip was
bleeding there was a blue gash beneath
his left eye the sleeves of his toga were
torn and the gown was streaked and
speckled with machine oil moreover
his shin was bruised so painfully that
he groaned nevertheless spratt felt
fortunate as he arose to his feet for
he knew that he escaped destruction by
a hairs breadth

   by the white fires he tought as he
gloomily surveyed the dimension-ma-
chine which now was little more than
a twisted mass of wreckage this
ends my experiments with super-space
ah well i suppose ill have to resign
myself ill never be anything more
for the rest of my life than dictator of
half the world 

  mournfully he continued his rumina-
tions as he mopped a perspiring brow
mighty lucky i took the precaution of

making the laboratory sound-proof
otherwise the explosion would have
been heard and then wouldnt i be the
laughing stock of two continents i not
openly of course he rambled on for
people still value their lives

  he took a step forward to examine
the ruins and as he did so he received
a shock only slightly less than that of
the explosion a low moan came to his
ears and something stirred slightly
amid the debris then while he paused
thunderstricken he heard a second
moan from a different direction and
something else moved amid the wreck-
age

  spratts first impulse was to flee
had he not been a son of the matter-of-
fact twenty-fifth century which had
long ceased to believe in ghosts haunt-
ings and other such unscientific non-
sense he might even have been filled
with superstitious terror nothing was
more certain than he had been alone
in the room only a minute before
-whence therefore the moans and
the mysterious movements the sit-
uation was one to daunt even a braver
man than spratt hence it is no won-
der if he trembled a little and felt his
scalp prickling while old ancestral
fears reviving from the childhood of
the race leapt up in his heart and
turned his knees to water

  within a second or two the moans
were repeated-and from two separate
directions and spratt as he backed
up slightly with a wildly hammering
heart thought of the secret button near
the door which he need only press in
order to send a score of mechanical po-
licemen clattering to his aid

  but before he could get within yards
of the button something occurred
which held him riveted to one spot and
caused his eyes almost to pop out of his
head he heard still another moan
followed by a much more vigorous stir-
ring amid the ruined machinery then
the lord of tranerica



something pushed itself up out of the
confusion of wires wheels and rods
and with a prodigious heaving move-
ment threw the obstructions out of its
way and staggered to its feet

  stricken speechless spratt stood face
to face-with another man and what
a man more than six feet tall and
with shoulders like a bullocks he tossed
a mane of touseled red hair and stared
about him in a dazed way through wide
blue eyes he was beardless but wore
a moustache-as no man had done for
centuries and his clothes-they were
like articles straight from a museum i
he wore tight-fitting dark trousers sur-
mounted by an equally tight-fitting dark
jacket-in the absurd ancient style
around his neck he wore a colored
rope his feet were hidden in shining
black cases instead of being displayed
in sandals even had his garments not
been rumpled and soiled he could have
shone in a masquerade without further
make-up

a fter glancing about him for a
moment as if stunned the stran
ger let a startled exclamation come to
his lips where am i and you-who
are you

  spratt noted what a strange enun-
ciation the man had it was clear that
he was speaking english and yet it was
hard very hard to make out what he
was saying

  i-i dont know what happened to
me continued the newcomer rubbing
his hand across his forehead as if to
wipe away the mists we-we were up
there together on the hilltop-and sud-
denly everything went blank and
then as recollection game flashing back
he cried out sharply almost furiously
she tell me-where is she

  but before spratt had had time to
answer-indeed before he had quite
made out the meaning of these words-
the strangers attention was caught by

another groan from amid the tangles

of broken machinery and he wheeled
about and frantically began working
amid the wreckage which he swept
aside with swift and powerful strokes
celia he cried in tones of tender-
ness and alarm celia dearest are
you hurt are you hurt

  no not much darling not much
came the reply in a softer voice and
a moment later another figure stood at
his side

  by the red furies can it be that
fairies are real thought spratt as
with a gasp he gazed at the second
stranger-a slender fragile figure all
clad in shimmery white with flowing
hair of such a rich golden and delicate
features with such an innocent pansy-
like grace that for a moment the dic-
tator wondered whether he were not
subject to hallucinations and were not
beholding an apparition rather than a
breathing woman

chapter ii
unexpected visitors

for a long silent minute spratt
stood staring at the two strangers
in a fascinated surprise equalled
only by the astonishment with which
they stared back at him but grad-
ually as the hazes cleared from his
mind the inventor realized what had
happened the dimension machine had
snatched these beings out of another
century by accident they had been
at the point where the dimensions
merged and had been hurled into the
twenty-fifth century from some remote
age it was evident that they were very
ancient not only from the cut of their
clothes but from-

spratts reveries were interrupted by
the voice of the girl-a full-throated


dynamic science stories

richly musical voice such as he did not
remember ever having heard before

 where-where are we what-
what has happened she ejaculated
still somewhat dazed as she leaned
against the man for support

  never mind sweetheart it will be
all right he soothed bending over her
solicitously it all seems like some
bad practical joke doesnt it

  spratt although he made every ef-
fort could not quite catch the meaning
of these words but he realized that it
was about time for him to say some-
thing accordingly he stepped for-
ward with a gracious sweep of his left
arm following the best twenty-fifth
century standards of etiquette and he
addressed the young lady by the name
he had heard the man employ

  you are very welcome sweetheart
he began with what he thought to be ex-
traordinary politeness from one in his
high position but he stopped short
very suddenly feeling that he had erred
somehow he did not like the quiver of
revulsion that passed through the girls
frame nor the icy glitter that came into
the mans eyes

  i do not know who you may be
declared the latter taking a pugnacious
forward stride but you assume strange
liberties on short acquaintance
would you mind repeating that
requested the dictator mildly you
pronounce english with such a quaint
accent im afraid i didnt catch one
word

  the strangers reply was a burst of
mocking laughter quaint accent
why you ought to hear yourself
youve got the damnedest foreign twist
to your tongue i ever heard any one
would know you hadnt been in the
country a year

ive been here all my life sir
snorted spratt indignantly when he
had caught the gist of the latter remark
i suppose youve been wearing that

circus costume too all your life
sneered the stranger with a gesture to-
ward spratts bejeweled purple toga
now smeared and spattered with ma-
chine oil dont you think its time
to cut out the comedy what in hells
name did you do to us anyway knock
us cold then kidnap us

  knock you cold kidnap you
circus costume repeated the dictator
with a puzzled expression i do not
know those words they have a very
queer antique sound if you will excuse
me i shall investigate

  while his visitors looked on with
wide gaping eyes he pressed a lettered
button that stood with hundreds of
others on a dial at one end of the room
a few seconds passed in silence then
a panel on the wall rattled open and a
huge volume slid in through a pneu-
matic tube and arranged itself neatly on
a table

  i his dictionary isnt exactly up-to-

  	the-minute remarked spratt as
he thumbed through the thousands of
pages it dates back to the late twen-
ty-four twenties    ah here we are
kidnap obsolete to steal bodily
refers to a barbarous practice of the
ages of confusion no case of which has
been known for over three hundred
years

  so thats what you accuse me off
he rushed on looking up and glaring at
the man resorting to a barbarous
practice of the ages of confusion in
order to steal you bodily do you give
me no credit at all for intelligence
say you must be daft muttered
the man im not interested in your
crazy remarks all i want to know is
when youre going to release me and
this young lady celia-miss stan-
wick

  stanwhat repeated spratt stan-
wick what a horrible name it
grates on the tongue like sand what
the lord of tranerica



did you say you wanted me to do

  release us set us free let us
go repeated the stranger with a
shout

  oh yes i see replied the dictator
im sorry but its impossible the
machine is broken and i couldnt get
you back to your own century even if i
wanted to

  our own century echoed the man
and the girl staring at one another in
bewilderment

  thats what i said reiterated
spratt i can tell from your clothes
and also from your speech that you
come from somewhere in the ages of
confusion maybe even as far back
as the year 

  the newcomers stood regarding
spratt in a quizzical silence as if not
knowing whether he were jesting or a
lunatic

  by the way just what year was it
before your change of dimension he
inquired

  you know damn well its 
came the mans growled reply

   well well well isnt that
interesting why thats much further
back than id dare to hope before
the first flush of the mental revival
now i know why your speech and man-
ners are so uncouth of course youre
not to be blamed for the backwardness
of your age i congratulate you-con-
gratulate both of you on escaping from
the dark generations into an eilight-
ened century

  say i cant make out half of what
youre saying but you ought to go on
the stage you say it so well growled
the man

  hed look wonderful in the movies
wouldnt he tittered the girl

  i consider it a piece of rare luck to
have met you continued spratt who
had not caught the drift of the last re-
marks ive always wondered how it
was possible for any one to live at all

in the dark generations-and now to
have first-hand information-why its
worth half my empire consider your-
selves my guests both of you so long
as you remain in tranerica-which i
trust will be for life you particu-
larly he concluded with an ogling
smile at celia who frowned in reply
and averted her fair head

  while spratt was making this speech
the red-haired man had sidled over to
the table on which lay the dictionary
whose heavy golden cover gave it an
unusual appearance with a gasp he
turned the leaves struck by the typog-
raphy which was of a style wholly new
to him then upon glancing at the title
page he let out a little cry of astonish-
ment

  ill be damned he exclaimed un-
der his breath and then in louder
tones ill be damned a thousand
times and finally at the top of his
voice come quick celia see just
see

 i he girl flitted to his side and her

  	eyes also widened with amazement
as she glanced at the lines he eagerly
pointed out printed for his honor
hannibal fairchild spratt the seventh
hudson highlands a d 

  yet there was an incredulous smile
on her face as she turned toward her
companion sounds so matter-of-fact
youd almost think it was real wouldnt
you she commented with a little
laugh

  yes its carrying a practical joke a
good deal further than youd expect he
acknowledged also with an unbelieving
smile what i want to know is who in
thunder is hannibal fairchild spratt
the seventh

  this was the dictators cue coming
forward with a broad grin on his baggy
face he bowed and made another wide
flourish with his left hand then de-
clared my dear friends from the twen-


dynamic science stories

tieth century the man you refer to is
none other than myself since you
would in the natural course of things
-hm-have died nearly five hundred
years ago you couldnt be expected to
gnize me but you see before you
tyngall of tranerica

  having made this announcement the
speaker stood erect and impressive
with a proud light in his glance as if
expecting his hearers to fall down on
their knees before him

  but to his surprise they did not
seem overwhelmed on the contrary
amused sparkles played in their eyes

  the what did you say demanded
the red-haired stranger a little in the
manner of one humoring a child

  the tyngall of tranerica re-
peated spratt imposingly tyagall of
tranerica  

  afraid i dont get you stated the
stranger

  the girl meanwhile had turned her
back and was struggling hard to re-
strain her laughter

  well ive said it as plainly as i
know how returned spratt dejectedly
and then as if a burst of light had come
over him he exclaimed of course i
oh of course i should have known
in your day tranerica wasnt called
teanerfca at all it wasnt until the
twenty-second century ghat the term
came into use a corruption of the old
trans-america so let me explain
again my friends what you see be-
fore you is the tyngall of trans-amer-
ica

  the strangers still looked blank
whats a tyngall they inquired

   oh by the spitting lightnings dont
you know that either but naturally
not naturally not he continued in the
manner of one suddenly recollecting
something the word was only intro-
duced by my renowned forebear han-
nibal fairchild spratt the first com-
monly known as the great it was a

name he took in place of the plebeian
designation of king dictator or em-
peror it means ruler of the world

 i he two visitors were exchanging
significant glances in which amuse-
ment alternated with a faint pity
poor fellow hefe nuts the man
whispered to the girl and she nodded
back expressively

  poor fellow nuts i do not know
what those expressions meanl re-
flected spratt whose keen ears had
caught the words i will remember to
look them up in the dictionary and
then in majestic tones you people do
not seem pleased to have the honor of
speaking to the tyngall

  oh we-we are overcome your
highness declared the red-haired one
bowing to the floor with a gesture of
mock courtesy

  will your eminence accept our pro-
foundest obeisance  exclaimed the girl
also bpwing but she was unable to keep
back the giggles that struggled to her
throat

  was every one in the twentieth
century like you thundered the tyn-
gall scowling in high displeasure was
it your custom to make mock of sol-
emn things do you not realize that if
any one else in all tranerica spoke to
me in such a fashion i would touch a
button that would send a death-bolt
shivering through his body from the
barrens of the yukon to the plains of
patagonia and from the waters of the
atlantic to those of the pacific i am
absolute lord and master-i alone the
undisputed tyngall-and there is none
who would dare to anger me

  these words were spoken with an
assurance an air of self-importance
that could not but sober the hearers a
little the laughter died from the girls
lips the mans attitude became rigid
and controlled though neither of them
doubted that they were face to face
the lord of tranerica



with a lunatic they also realized that
he might prove dangerous if goaded
too far

  i see that you question my asser-
tions continued spratt still with a
frown you would not only challenge
my integrity you would deny the evi-
dence of your own senses they say
you ancients were a stubborn crowd
who wouldnt believe much of anything
except a lot of gibberish accepted on
faith but i never suspected how stu-
pid you could be however if what
you want is more proof you shall have
it

  even as he spoke he pulled a lever
and a panel on the wall rattled open re-
vealing a glass partition facing the river
below them for endless distances the
huge black bulks of the hives tow-
ered on both sides of the stream

  look commanded the dictator
then tell me if you had anything like
that in the twentieth century

  the man and girl hastened to do as
directed at the first glimpse they
reeled a little like persons who have
been struck a blow they gasped and
let out low startled exclamations and
the girl staggered against the man for
support

  harry harry darling she cried
in a half fainting condition is it real
or am i dreaming

   for several long silent seconds harry
continued staring at those colossal black
structures that lined the river then
slowly he declared i guess were both
dreaming

  no no were not she wailed re-
viving and springing out of his arms as
realization came upon her its true

  its true we-weve gone to another
age well never-never see our own
world again

  well what of it dearest he
soothed passing one hand consolingly
over her glistening golden hair i still
cant believe its not some sort of trick

but even if it isnt weve still got one
another havent we i suppose we can
marry just as easily in the twenty-fifth
century as in the twentieth

   not unless i give permission put
in the tyngall glaring ominously at the
speaker

  i hink dearest we hadnt much

  	except each other had we con-
tinued harry my job as an airplane
mechanic-dont you suppose i could
get something just as good in another
age tell the truth in some ways id
be tickled think how neatly wed be
rid of all our pestering relations
well thats so she admitted look-
ing up at him with an attempt to be
brave but her smile came through her
tears still its hard to think that
father - poor father - must have
passed away centuries ago and we
couldnt even be there to say a last
prayer for him

   he looked pretty healthy to me last
week-or five hundred years ago when-
ever it was-when he ordered me out
of the house so as to hitch you up with
that swilling bankers son my god
celia when i think of that it seems
to me the luckiest thing that could have
happened to us both was to get clean
out of the century

   well that is one way of looking at
it she acknowledged smiling and
weeping all at once and his arms
gathered her into a close embrace

  come come interrupted the dic-
tator impatiently i cant bear such
maudlin sentimentality you ancients
are hard to understand i should im-
agine that having found yourself in an-
other century youd have something
else to think of than throwing your arms
around one another and cooing like two
babes 

  stung by the contempt in spratts
tones the two strangers separated and
looked up


dynamic science stories

  love-making in public is considered
immoral nowadays  continued spratt
severely however being only two
ignoramuses from the twentieth cen-
tury you couldnt be expected to know
that so ill pardon you this time but
dont let it happen again its more
than modern sensibilities can stand
the man and girl said nothing but
still glanced at spratt as if doubtful of
his sanity

  now lets get down to something
important he went on hastily the
question is what am i to do with you
well ill decide in due time first of
all it may be interesting to show you
something of the modern world it will
be edifying to see your reactions be-
sides it may help me to break the mo-
notony of life so if youll come this
way well begin our preparations
still without a word the two visitors
followed but it was coming to them
more and mone clearly that in some
mysterious way they were subject to
the whim and command of this indi-
vidual with the purple toga and the
outlandish manners and speech

chapter iii
a realm of wizardry

it seemed to both strangers that they
had entered some fairy-book realm
where a wizard with his magical
wand brought wonders to pass for
the tyngall merely lifted a small steel
rod and waved it as might a musical
conductor directing an invisible orches-
tra and instantly a partition in the
floor opened and three little cushioned
cars shot out each moving on a pair of
broad-based wheels arranged bicycle-
fashion two of the cars glided up to
harry and celia as if under intelligent
direction and after they had entered

one in each car the vehicles darted
away again and whirled them through
long lighted tunnels at what seemed
breakneck speed

  it was only a minute later when they
halted in a room filled with long shim-
mery rows of blue green and crimson
cloths which hung from hooks on a
ceiling fifteen feet above this is the
dressery stated the tyngall who had
followed close behind naturally if
we are going to show you around well
have to array you in respectable
clothes

  respectable echoed both stran-
gers in one breath

  of course you hardly call those
rags presentable do you he de-
manded pointing to the visitors fan-
tastic twentieth century apparel i
suppose it did all right in your own day
when you didnt know any better-but
the world has advanced my friends the
world has advanced  

  you dont expect me to put on a
stage costume like yours demanded
harry

  stage costume stage you an-
cients did have the most curious idioms
i merely wish you to dress sensibly and
decently and of course youll have
to remove your red hair

  what bawled harry with a dis-
pleased glance at the dictators glisten-
ing pate you mean cut it off

  not necessarily it will suffice to
dye it black

  ill be damned if i will

  youll be damned if you dont do
you not understand sir we havent had
a case of red-headedness in this coun-
try for two hundred years

  you talk as if it were something like
diphtheria or scarlet fever

  well in a way it is asserted the
tyngall with a yawn you see a few
centuries ago the racial purists got con-
trol of the government they happened
to be black-headed and proved that
the lord of tranerica



black-heads possess all the highest spir-
itual intellectual and moral qualities
lower in the scale were the brown-
heads but the lowest of all were the
red-heads this was demonstrated with
statistics compiled by black-headed
statisticians hence the drive on the
reds began they were herded out of
the country jailed stoned and burned
their property was confiscated and their
propagation was prohibited in due
time consequently their breed disap-
peared the movement was called by
various names such as the survival of
the fittest and saving tranerica for de-
mocracy-though sometimes to tell the
truth ive had my doubts but the old
prejudice persists and today it would
be as much as any mans life was worth
to appear in public with red hair

 i he tyngall heaved a long sigh
 which was met with answering sighs
from the girl and harry well in that
case decided the latter after a si-
lence i suppose theres nothing to be
done but dye my hair

 good you show remarkable
sense for an ancient approved spratt
beaming and then turning to the girl
he suggested and now if you will pass
that door to your left sweetheart-no
no i forgot thats not your name is
it-anyhow you will find a dressing
room with a mechanical maid to help
you

  mechanical maid repeated celia
wondering if she had heard correctly

  of course    didnt you have
mechanical maids in your century
   well well well just imagine
how did you women ever manage
just go in there sweet-i mean young
lady and you will find out everything

  after the girl had left and the door
had automatically closed behind her
spratt pulled a little crank on the wall
and a long metal box at one end of the
room clattered open out of this case

there stalked what at the first startled
glimpse harry took to be a man-a
man eight feet tall and with long swing-
ing limbs a second glimpse however
showed him that the being had no face
other than two small gleaming electric
orbs which served in place of eyes its
arms and legs as it came clanking
across the room were seen to be of iron
its trunk beneath the gray toga which
it wore was obviously of the same sub-
stance its head bristled with electric
batteries instead of hair a coil of wires
reached out from behind it and there
was a continuous buzzing from some-
where in its heart

  didnt you have electrical valets
either in your day inquired spratt
with a pitying expression as the iron
monster approached at a steady stride

  no thank goodness declared
harry retreating slightly although he
strove his best to hold his ground

  but he watched in fascinated inter-
est as the automaton halted just in front
of spratt reached one long arm upward
plucked a violet toga from a hook near
the ceiling spread it out before the
tyngall and deftly folded and removed
the oil-smeared robe which spratt
doffed the great seven-fingered hands
of the machine moreover smoothed
out and dusted the dictators new
clothes after he had donned them then
as if under intelligent guidance turned
to harry and prepared to perform a
similar service for him

  you see the principle is simple
explained spratt as be noted the dumb-
founded amazement on his visitors face
it works by radio control electrical
impulses which i discharge through the
air by pressing a button or moving a
switch or rod are transmitted to very
sensitive receiving bulbs within the
valet and then by means of ampli-
fiers-

  but it is questionable whether harry
heard much of this speech he was


dynamic science stories

too much occupied with the process of
changing clothes and was both amused
and embarrassed to see himself pre-
sented with an embroidered saffron-
colored toga with billowy sleeves and
sea-green decorations by heaven
he muttered as he struggled to adjust
the new garb its lucky my friends
are dead five centuries and cant see
me now

tie had hardly completed his dress-
a ing when the dictator by turning
a screw caused the door to their left
to open and celia emerged arrayed in
black pantaloons like those of chinese
women and with an open-necked un-
decorated black jacket

  good lord dont i look atrocious
she exclaimed blushing is this how
all women nowadays are dressed
naturally returned the tyngall in
slightly offended tones you cant ex-
pect them to wear gaudy clothes like
us men can you since nature gave
them so many graces and charms what
need have they of rich garments to en-
hance their beauty it isnt as with us
poor males who need yvery bright col-
or to conceal our natural drabness
you look good to me celia in any
clothes harry sought to console her

  and you-why good gracious
harry you look like a one-man vaude-
ville show cried the girl with a sud-
den burst of laughter as she caught her
first full view of her lover

  one-man vaudeville show vaude-
ville show repeated spratt thats
something else ill have to make a note
of i wonder whether its in the dic-
tionarry and then looking up with a
sudden new briskness of manner
well now that were all nicely dressed
lets start on our little journey

  before they set out however spratt
remembered to procure a botde of some
inky substance which was rubbed on
harrys hair by the mechanical valet

and changed it to the color of tar ah
now you look almost modern  ex-
claimed the tyngall approvingly as he
stood back a few feet to examine his
metamorphosed visitor its clear
after all that red-headedness is only
skin deep

  now well clip off those hairs from
your face continued spratt indicat-
ing harrys moustache the ancients
had a name for it i cant remember
what no man nowadays would dream
of growing such a brush under his
nose

  it was useless for the victim to pro-
test the electrical valet produced a
pair of shears and set to work and
harry thought it wise not to resist too
strenuously lest some accidental mo-
tion cause half of his lip to be forfeited

  heavens dearest if i didnt know
it was you now id never believe it
commented celia ruefully as she sur-
veyed her transformed lover

  a great improvement im sure
contributed the tyngall and now
lets see just where shall i take you
first perhaps to the mills in that
case we will need some special ear pro-
tectors

  he pressed a button and three black
instruments looking like ear-phones
slid in through a pneumatic tube put
these over your ears friends he in-
structed otherwise the din would
deafen you

  the others did as directed and then
seated themselves again in the little
cushioned cars away they rushed so
rapidly that the wind whistled by them
along twisting vaguely lighted corri-
dors down abrupt descents then up
steep grades and down once more
they had no idea where they were go-
ing and were relieved when at last the
cars halted and they found themselves
before a huge steel door in a shadowy
room reminding them of a railroad wait-
ing station
the lord of tranerica



kto sooner had the tyngall joined

	 them than the steel door groaned
and opened-and all at once they rea-
lized why they had had to wear the ear
protectors even through the muffling
fabrics they could hear an uproar like
that of several boiler works combined
-a continuous pounding hammering
stamping clanging noise as of countless
great iron masses in violent contact
they found themselves stepping into
an enormous hall-a hall several hun-
dred yards long and almost equally
wide its ceiling supported by scores
of branching steel pillars rose to a
height of three hundred feet its win-
dowless walls were featured by clusters
of white lights so bright that the spec-
tators had to blink and shield their eyes
while a fine dust arose everywhere ir-
ritating the throat and nostrils

  all along the floor of this colossal
hall in dozens of mathematically even
rows were machines that towered to a
height of thirty or forty feet with an
intricacy of clattering spindles thump-
ing rods whirring wheels and rotating
chains and before each machine there
stood a figure that would have seemed
fantastic beyond belief had the observ-
ers not already known of the mechan-
ical maid and valet fifteen feet in
height with iron limbs and body each
of these figures was exactly like every
other each was made in the image of a
man except that its hands were nine-
fingered that it had three electric lights
where the face should have been and
that wires ran in and out of its legs
and head and each standing stiff and
erect was operating with clock-like reg-
ularity first its hands would shoot
up moving the levers of the machine
before it then down with a crash the
hands would come then after a sec-
onds rest they would rise again in
precisely the same movements as be-
fore and the motions of all the ma-
chines were so perfectly synchronized

that one was reminded of a well trained
military company executing drill ma-
neuvers

   for a minute the strangers looked on
appalled and fascinated then spratt
motioned them away  and after the
steel gate had closed behind them and
they were back in a place of relative
quiet he removed his ear protectors
and declared it isnt good to remain
too long-very damaging to the ears
and nervous system

  what under heaven is it asked
harry awe-stricken

  why the mills of course replied
the dictator in the manner of one ex-
plaining to a stupid child

  but where are the men

  what would men be doing in that
inferno do you think we are so back-
ward as to let human beings work in
the mills

  harry and celia both stared and
looked blank

  why ever since the humanitarian
reform of the last century weve had
machines to run our machines we find
mechanical laborers as far superior to
flesh-and-blood laborers as motor cars
are to the animals which used to pull
your carts-what do you call them-
ive forgotten the name

  horses prompted harry

   as far superior to living man as mo-
tor cars were to horses besides they
have other advantages mechanical
laborers never grow tired they never
talk back to the boss they never strike
for shorter hours or higher pay they
never shirk or get drunk they never
form unions or commit sabotage they
never have to be pensioned off in case
of illness or old age and their efficiency
is never disturbed by any psychological
quirk all in all they constitute the
perfect solution of the past labor prob-
lem

  but do you need no living men at
all


dynamic science stories

ery few the machines rarely
v break down all we require is an
occasional superintendent and a small
corps of experts who direct the mechan-
ical workers by remote radio control
the mills you have just seen are among
the largest in tranerica but theyre
many others built on the same plan
what do they make in this one
inquired celia

  mechanical workers manufactur-
ing mechanical workers is in fact one
of our major industries

  but that means that most human
beings are thrown out of work pointed
out harry the unemployment prob-
lem must be simply terrific

  terrific whats that word de-
manded the tyngall oh you mean
very bad well to tell you the truth
it was quite troublesome before the age
of readjustment but my great-great
granddad hannibal fairchild spratt
the third hit upon the ideal remedy
youll learn all about that in due time
when we get to visiting the hives
meanwhile dont you want to see a
little more of the mills

  very gladly exclaimed the two
strangers and once more they entered
the little cushioned cars and went
shooting away through corridors and
tunnels

        chapter iv
        the hivites

if the visitors were astonished at
their first glimpse of the mills they
were to be sheerly bewildered by
their later discoveries they were taken
to the furnaces where mechanical
workers twenty feet tall wielded shovels
as large as five-passenger automobiles
and cast tons of coal each minute into
gigantic fires they were brought to the

construction room where mechanical
workers measured riveted and carried
huge steel beams and girders they were
introduced to the warehouses where
automatic arms packed and assorted
thousands of bales and crates with
scientific exactness they were given
glimpses of electrical laborers that
scrubbed floors and that painted walls
that plastered and that drove nails that
crawled to fix pipes and drains that
sat at workstools and that adjusted the
lights of the ceiling with their long
slender arms

  eventually the party stopped for re-
freshments at a little inn where the
viands were brought to them by me-
chanical waiters after being prepared
in automatic ovens by mechanical
cooks next they descended to a point
far below ground level where great
vaulted caverns supported by concrete
columns spread for miles all along the
ceiling and pillars were clusters of bril-
lant white lights so dazzling that the
visitors had to be  rovided with sun-
glasses while endless rows of glass
cases separated by narrow aisles were
spread across the floors each of these
cases was filled with water which varied
in depth from two or three inches to
several feet and in this water green
things grew in crowded profusion in
an atmosphere as warm as a hothouse
the visitors were surprised to see ripen-
ing tomatoes strawberries and cante-
loupes while the enticing reds and yel-
lows of apricots plums and cherries
greeted them from low dense clusters
of trees

  you see here an example of scienti-
fic agriculture stated the tyngall
over a century ago we solved the
chemical secret of sunlight and hence
are able to reproduce its properties in
the white lights you see all about you
so stimulating the chlorophyll of the
plants to form starch sugar and cellu-
lose out of water and carbon dioxide
the lord of tranerica



all agriculture nowadays is accom-
plished indoors where we are not de-
pendent on the weather

  but your plants dont seem to have
any soil-only water pointed out
harry

  naturally not it has been known
for centuries-in fact i shouldnt be
surprised if it was common knowledge
even in your own day-that all that
plants need for growth is water with
the proper chemicals in solution we
take care to supply these in sufficient
quantities-and as a result production
is rapid and continuous i forget the
exact figures-but i believe it has been
proved that one acre under cultivation
nowadays can produce as much as five
hundred acres by the primitive meth-
ods

  while the tyngall was speaking the
visitors attention was attracted to a
mechanical worker equipped with par-
ticularly long slender arms who came
clanking down one of the aisles pluck-
ing the ripe fruit from the trees and
depositing it in a large open box fast-
ened to his waist

   you see farm labor also is entirely
mechanized continued spratt even
the cows are milked automatically you
have no idea how this simplifies things

vvhat i dont understand re-

  	v marked harry as he observed
how efficiently the mechanical orchard-
ist gathered the fruit is where the men
and women are is your whole world
inhabited by machines do you real-
ize mr--mr spratt i think it is-
call me tyngall spratt and show
proper respect roared the dictator
i do not know what mister means
tyngall spratt continued harry
undaunted do you not realize that we
havent seen any living person except
yourself as far as we can judge you
might be the only man alive in the
twenty-fifth century

  well you shall see you shall see
very soon promised the tyngall i
do not know the exact figures the me-
chanical statisticians broke down at the
last census two years ago-but it is
believed that the population of north
tranerica alone is not less than two
billions shall i take you now to the
hives

  harry and celia both nodded and
accordingly they left the basement
farms in their little cushioned cars and
wove their way hundreds of feet upward
by long winding ascents

  i really must apologize for the
hives spratt warned them before
they set out on this new expedition
they are not as ideal as we could wish
since they date back to the twenty-
second century and were originally
built to house working families but
now that the reign of leisure has be-
gun weve had to adapt them as best
we can-

  reign of leisure questioned
celia

  to be sure since the machines per-
form all our services no man needs to
work unless he wants to in fact theres
no way for most men to work even if
they do want to they are regularly
supplied with all necessities-and their
days are one long golden opportunity

  opportunity for what questioned
the skeptical harry

  opportunity to develop their higher
qualities but you shall see come lets
go

  a few minutes later having been
whisked several miles away they halted
in what seemed to be an enormous dor-
mitory on each side of a corridor sev-
eral hundred yards long a succession of
dozens of doors opened and each door
led to a room or a group of several
rooms provided with steel furniture and
illuminated by electric bulbs built into
the walls none of them so far as the
strangers could see had a window open-


dynamic science stories

mg to the daylight

  this is a typical floor in one of the
hives explained the tyngall each
hive is a hundred and twenty stories
high and there are hundreds of hives
in hudson highlands alone you have
seen the compartments occupied by in-
dividual families-

  compartments you mean apart-
ments corrected harry

  no i mean compartments this
word modern authorities agree is much
more accurate of the two but lets go
on i will now show you how the hivites
pass their time

  hivites

  yes the inhabitants of the hives-
in other words the common people
the great masses who would have had
to work for a living in a less fortunate
age

  both harry and celia naturally
were eager for a glimpse of the hivites
but their enthusiasm would have been
considerably dampened could they have
foreseen the adventure that lay in wait

i think we will go first to the day

	rooms continued the tyngall
the chambers where the hivites pass
their daily fourteen or sixteen hours of
leisure

  dont they ever go out of doors
inquired celia

  out of doors why should they
returned spratt wrinkling his nostrils
with a disgusted expression why
should any one go out of doors when
modern improvements have given us
perfect heating perfect lighting and
perfect air conditioning indoors no
no my friends we dont take any
chance of exposing ourselves to the
cruel winds or the blistering sun that
may all have been very well in ancient
times when people couldnt help them-
selves but nowadays we are civilized

  a few minutes later they stood in a
hish-ceilinged corridor before a series

of enormous gates each marked day
rooms in blazing red letters the
tyngall pressed a button and one of
the gates rattled open while half a
dozen mechanical guards each ten feet
tall stalked out and surrounded the
party

  what i do not understand re-
marked harry as they entered the day
rooms in the midst of the guards is
that sometimes i see you pressing a but-
ton or switch to move the mechanical
workers and at other times they seem
to act by themselves almost as if they
had an independent power of thought

  yes it does seem that way ad-
mitted the tyngall but they are al-
ways under human control the work-
ers in the mills and farms for example
are all guided by radio waves shot out
by operators in a central station who
keep track of their movements by tele-
vision in the same way our guards
now are under remote control but im
surprised you have to ask about such
simple matters in your own day didnt
you have robot airplanes that could be
guided by radio and werent you able
to set type hundreds of miles away by
wire what we have done is merely to
make the natural advance upon such
elementary beginnings

  there was much more than the tyn-
gall said in explanation but neither
harry nor celia heard him for they
were both absorbed in observing the
day rooms

  they found themselves in a series of
cavernous connecting halls with wide
vaulted ceilings supported by concrete
columns the whole had been laid out
on the plan of a park graveled walks
wound among lawns and patches of
shrubbery and here and there were lit-
tle ponds where water-lilies blossomed
and swans lifted their heads but the
green spaces pleasing as they were to
the eye were largely hidden from view
by the swarms of people who crowded
the lord of tranerica



everywhere-as thickly as on the central
business street of a large city

  upon spratts appearance hundreds
of them flung themselves on the ground
with cries of reverence and adoration
and shouted in voices that sounded al-
most automatic tyngall oh tyn-
gall hail tyngall many creeping
like animals on all fours would have
come close to kiss the hem of the dic-
tators robe had not the swinging arms
of the mechanical guards kept them
away many others standing erect
gave a military salute but all alike kept
repeating the same cry which dinned
about them with maddening insistence
tyngall oh tyngall hail tyn-
gall

   the visitors noted that the men and
children all wore bright-colored togas-
purple and lavender apple-green sap-
phire-blue and ruby-red-while the
women were all clad in unadorned
brown gray or black none of the men
were bearded and most of them were
bald like the tyngall they were all
milky pale of complexion with a ten-
dency to baggy eyes and heavy
paunches and many had long drawn
faces with down-curling pessimistic
lips that seemed most surprising in view
of the boundless leisure they all en-
joyed

out how did they pass their leisure

    the two strangers were fascinated
to note the occupations of the hivites
here and there little groups sprawled
on the grass were absorbed in shuf-
fling minute colored patches of card-
board and from time to time would
break out in loud disputatious cries
here and there little bands were play-
ing with small balls which they threw
into the air and caught and here and
there parties of youths were engaged in
racing contests or in exhibitions of box-
ing and wrestling but a much more
popular recreation apparently was to

lie under a bush and sip a colored bever-
age out of long-necked bottles-in fact
it seemed that fully a quarter of the
hivites were enjoying this sport con-
stantly and meanwhile fully another
quarter were gathered about little clat-
tering machines shouting in high agi-
tation as they dropped pebbles through
tiny slots and threshing furiously and
yelling like wild beasts when a red dial
registered the results

  what are they doing questioned
celia wondering if she had not strayed
by mistake into a lunatics ward

  merely passing the time replied
the tyngall you see its quite a prob-
lem with the hivites what to do with
all their time so theyve invented this
little game theyre gambling for peb-
bles

  pebbles but what use are peb-
bles

  none at all however since we
dont have any money nowadays weve
got to have something to keep the hivi-
tes amused pebbles will do as well as
anything

  at this instant their attention was
distracted by a frenzied outburst where
two of the pebble-gamblers had fallen
upon one another and were pounding
and slashing at each others faces as if
hent on murder fraud cheat
bandit they both screamed in out-
raged voices hes robbed me hes
robbed me cheat ruffian brigand
and they tore at one another until they
were both bruised and bleeding and
their togas were ripped to shreds while
the crowd stood about them eager and
delighted and goaded them on with
taunts and yells

  but whats it all about demanded -
celia if theyre only playing for 
pebbles-

  the psychology of the hivites is
very peguliar explained the tyngall 
having nothing more important to
think about they hoard theif pebbles 


dynamic science stories

and consider them priceless but let
them fight it out a little quarrel now
and then helps them to break the mono-
tony of life

  with a shrug the dictator passed on
and pointed to a walled gray enclosure
of about the size of a large house do
you want to go in he suggested
thats the library

  the visitors entered but found to
their surprise that there was no other
occupant except one old man who was
dozing at the end of a long table with
several great tomes lying open before
him the books which lay stacked
about them in innumerable shelves
were covered with deep layers of dust
the covers were all age-worn and
cracked and a smell of must and age
pervaded the establishment

  the hivites im afraid dont care
much about reading declared the tyn-
gall they say the pace of modern life
is too fast they havent sufficient lei-
sure-

  but i thought you said they had
nothing but leisure  gasped celia

  yes-but not for reading that re-
quires concentration oh by the way
over there is the case of ancient books
dates way back to your own time may-
be youd like to glance at it

  he tyngall strode over to a shelf

	where the dust was even deeper than
elsewhere and plucked out a volume at
random collected works of bernard
-bernard whats that-shaw i sup-
pose it is he deciphered with difficul-
ty wonder who he could have been
ill have to instruct the librarian to go
over this place sometime and clear out
a lot of this worm-eaten trash

  celia in turn pulled out a volume
glanced at it with a stare of surprise
then turned about to exclaim what
do you think harry heres gone with
the wind

  but her words died half uttered

had harry also gone with the wind
he was no longer at her side-in fact
he was nowhere in the library

  with fluttering heart she ran to the
entrance crying as she went dearest
dearest where are you where are
you but the pandemonium of the
throngs outside drowned the tones of
her voice when she reached the library
door she saw only the dense crowds
billowing about her throwing their lit-
tle balls and playing with their bits of
colored cardboard harry had vanished
as completely as though the earth had
swallowed him

        chapter v
    the tyngall proposes

for a long silent moment celia
stood staring into the heedless
multitude then an excited cry
came once more to her lips harry
harry where are you some of the
passers-by looked up a little curious
then returned to their games with
shrugs and comical grimaces while at
the same time she felt a hand clutching
at her shoulder

 wheeling about with the happy
thought that harry had come back she
found herself gazing into the pouchy
face and small gray questioning eyes
of the tyngall

  what is it my lady he inquired
you act as if you have lost something
i have she declared gloomily i
-i dont know where harry is

  the tyngall did not appear dis-
turbed well he returned with a
smile we mustnt let little things
annoy us really i dont mind in the
least so long as i have you

  but im afraid  mind consider-
ably she protested not liking the way
he beamed upon her with a half pos-
the lord of tranerica



sessive smile come lets look for
him

  whats the use objected spratt
it would be very hard to find him
you see we havent numbered him
yet

  numbered him

  of course all the hivites have
numbers for example ax  or
zy  thats how we keep track
of them when oncc a man has lost his
number or hasnt a number at all there
is no system of tracing him among all
the millions of hivites

   celia still stood gazing disconsolate-
ly out into the crowd straining her eyes
to catch a glimpse of a tall familiar fig-
ure at any other time she would have
been absorbed in what she saw the
women amusing themselves by regard-
ing their own images long and steadily
in full-length mirrors the little ma-
chines in which the ladies put their
faces screaming with pain while the
wrinkles were being ironed out the
pairs of lovers strolling arm in arm the
youths and girls jesting and quarreling
as they bustled past and the gay par-
ties singing and shouting bat all this
meant nothing to her for nowhere could
she find any sign of the one she desired
to see

  come lets step insfde where we
will be by ourselves said the tyngall
taking celias arm and leading her back
into the library there they found
themselves entirely alone for the
drowsy old man interrupted in his
slumbers had arisen with the grumbling
complaint that even in the libraries
nowadays theres no privacy and had
stumbled off with a book under his arm

  i do hope harry will find his way
back here soon exclaimed celia
growing more alarmed moment by mo-
ment

  well what if he doesnt inquired
spratt to tell the truth young lady
that would suit me just as well yes

in fact it would suit me a great deal
better it might have been very bother-
some for us to have him around

   for us echoed the girl peering at
the tyngall with a sudden sharp sus-
picion as she backed into a gallery of
books marked medieval twenty-first
century then was it you-was it you
who-

   no no not i young lady inter-
rupted the tyngall waving one hand in
a gesture of denial by my mechanical
boots if i had schemed to get rid of
him i could have found an easier
way

ut you will help me find him
wont you wont you begged
the girl looking up at him with eyes of
clear blue innocent appeal

   if fate has seen fit to remove him
asked the tyngall sententiously while
he leaned against a time-worn shelf of
the twenty-third century neo-classical
poets then why should i refuse the
gifts it proffers i believe i shall enjoy
your company very much better with-
out him

  oh you-you are horrible ac-
cused the girl retreating with tears in
her eyes

   not at all young lady merely hu-
man though i do live in the twenty-
fifth century and am a tyngall i am
able to appreciate one of natures works
of art in the shape of a fair woman you
would not believe it but my life has
been a very lonely one

   i dont see why that should interest
me

  come come you are not so short-
sighted as you pretend it ought to in-
terest you very much there are mil-
lions of women who would throw them-
selves down on their knees and offer up
thanks at the prospect of having a tyn-
gall in marriage

  a tyngall-hi marriage

   celia had by this time backed to the


dynamic science stories

extreme end of an alcove labeled his-
tory of tranerica rise of the tyngall
spratts the dictator stood barring
her exit-and escape seemed impossi-
ble

  oh harry she offered up her
silent prayer wont you come wont
you come back soon

  my high position continued her
persecutor in plaintive tones and with
a wistful look in his eyes has made
me meet too many women-and too
few they have swarmed about me
bent on matrimony a tyngall as they
well knew would be a rare catch you
cant blame them of course but natur-
ally i didnt want to be caught so i
have remained a bachelor though my
heart cried out for the comforts of
home and family you are the first
eligible lady i have ever met who didnt
want to marry me consequently i
couldnt help falling in love let me
congratulate you on your good fortune 
my empire is at your feet you shall
be the first lady in tranerica

  spratt ended with a flourish and
reached out his arms as if to enfold the
object of his devotion but she managed
to take from the bookshelves a dusty
tome on diplomatic intrigues of the
twenty-fourth century and imposed
it between her and her suitor as a sort
of shield

  mr spratt she began to protest
in cool and haughty tones i-
tyngall spratt he corrected
scowling always address me as tyn-
gall spratt

  tyngall spratt she amended i
should be flattered i suppose at your
attentions-

  not at all he denied it is the
just reward of your merits

  i should be flattered she con-
tinued but you forget that i am al-
ready engaged

  pooh what of it he scoffed i
abrogate the engagement

  you also forget she protested
angrily that i do not want it
abrogated

  your wishes in the matter my dear
lady he returned suavely are of no
importance whatever remember it is
i who am accustomed to giving orders
when shall we place the date of the
happy event

otill secretly praying for harrys
return celia glanced along the
aisles of books desperately wondering
if there were not some way to slip past
the tyngall

  ill admit continued spratt sol-
emnly it never occurred to me i
was to marry a girl five hundred years
old but that doesnt matter i suppose
you really dont look your age at all
one wouldnt think you were a day
over nineteen

  im only eighteen specified the
girl trying hard to keep back the tears
that flooded to her eyes

  well well well and youll be the
tyngalless of tranerica in less than a
month lets see its now the first
of january january thirty-first was
the day when my celebrated ancestor
hannibal fairchild spratt the great
made his historic march to power what
more natural than that this day be
chosen to solemnize the tie which we
may reasonably hope will perpetuate
his line

  celia made a struggling effort to
reply but her sobs prevented

  now now now dear lady dont let
your emotion overcome you soothed
the tyngall its natural that you
should weep tears of joy shall we not
leave now and go up for a lovers chat
in the crystal room of my castle
still the girl continued to weep but
the tyngall meditated in a pleasant
vein ill have a busy month ahead
sending out the announcements to all
tranerica-it will keep the air-waves
the lord of tranerica



busy many womens hearts will be
broken-but alas that cant be helped
im sure i couldnt find a worthier mate
in all tranerica even if she does come
from a barbarous century

  meanwhile between her sobs celia
mumbled brokenly harry harry
where are you harry and her heart
was heavy within her for still her lover
did not return and she felt as if by in-
tuition that some evil had befallen him

       chapter vi
       amid the mazes

hile celia was examing
the volumes in the library
harry had strolled to the
entrance of the building for books had
very little interest for him once out-
side he had wandered a few yards
away to observe some individuals who
were pasting some scraps of tin foil in
a large folder marked curio collec-
tions from the absorbed interest with
which they were preserving and label-
ing various worthless fragments of
colored paper harry judged them to be
not quite right in the head and he was
smiling pleasantly to himself and re-
flecting on the superiority of his own
age when he saw a rush of excited men
bearing down upon him

   what is it a football charge he
had barely time to ask himself before
he was caught by the mob and forced
to rush along with them in order not to
be trampled being a powerful man
he might soon have extricated himself
but curiosity had taken possession of
him and when the crowd halted with
shouts and yells before a fenced en-
closure containing a circular roadway
he halted with them and pressed for-
ward to a position among the foremost
the jigger races the jigger races

he heard them clamoring hurrah
hurrah the jigger races and his
neighbors began arguing loudly as to
who would win and bet hundreds of
pebbles on the results

   a moment later dozens of little cars
each about as large as a motorcycle and
running on gyroscopic wheels were
brought upon the track which was per-
haps two hundred yards around and
ten feet wide a single rider mounted
each vehicle and almost instantly at
the blast of a whistle they began whirl-
ing about the track some going to the
right and some to the left but all mov-
ing so rapidly that they seemed mere
gray blurs that passed with a whistling
as of a great wind

  what is it all about wondered
harry and decided that the object was
to see how near the riders could come
to one another without hitting for they
constantly seemed to avoid collisions
by a hairs breadth not always how-
ever for in a minute there came a
thunderous crash accompanied by a
burst of flame and after water had
been applied from a hydrant above the
shapeless remnants of two machines and
their riders were swept away by a me-
chanical attendant

  curses he heard a profane voice
to his left by the blue lightnings
what luck ive lost seventy pebbles

  even as these words were uttered
there came a second crash-which took
two more machines and two more lives
but no one seemed disturbed except
certain pebble-losers who grumbled
loud and mournfully the jigger races
as harry was afterwards told were
among the main sporting events of tra-
nerica-and although they cost a few
million lives a year no one begrudged
the cost except a few stiff-backed hu-
manitarians for they served to kill
time and to amuse the multitude

  but harry not being a native tra-
nerican lost his taste for the sport after


dynamic science stories

witnessing the third fatal collision as
hastily as he could he forced his way
out of the crowd glad that he had been
born in a more enlightened age

it was then that with sudden sharp
 ness he remembered celia and the
tyngall by jove he told himself
theyll think ive dropped through a
black hole in the earth and he set
out hastily to rejoin them-only to
pause in bewilderment his surround-
ings were unfamiliar on all sides as
before were lawns and shrubbery
crowded with people and reaching to
the extreme ends of the wide intercon-
necting halls but where was the lib-
rary

  good lord he mumbled half
aloud i didnt watch my directions
and then tapping a passer-by on the
shoulder he inquired beg pardon
friend could you tell me the way to the
library

  the man looked up startled and re-
garded him with surprised watery eyes
why should you beg pardon he de-
manded you have done nothing to
me but you make a mistake in calling
me friend i have never seen you be-
fore

  all right all right interrupted
harry impatiently cut out the gab
and tell me the way to the library

  library returned the man look-
ing puzzled never heard of such a
place

  i mean where they keep the books

  oh the book-museum-as the boys
like to call it yes i do believe theres
one somewhere around but i couldnt
tell you where havent time for such
things myself im too busy collecting
tin foil

  the man stared at harry peculiarly
as one might at a harmless lunatic then
went ambling on his way

  gosh but they have strange types
in this century harry reflected and

immediately accosted another passer-
by and repeated his question

  library what do you want to get
to the library for inquired the second
stranger a purple-faced individual with
a cask-shaped abdomen theres noth-
ing there to drink  he likewise did not
know tbe way and this was the case
with the third the fourth the fifth the
sixth and the seventh person that harry
stopped

  he now thought of asking a police-
man but as there were only mechanical
guards who were not educated to an-
swer questions he had to dismiss this
idea it then occurred to him to request
to be taken to the tyngall but the
individual to whom he put this sugges-
tion-a grave-looking bent old man-
appeared horrified and at a loss for a
reply

  evidently sir he finally said
you are not a tranerican most likely
youre from paneura or afasia or some
other remote region even if i couldnt
tell that from your tone of voice i
would be sure of it from your question
every tranerican knows that no one
can ever be taken to the tyngall with-
out being summoned

  but i was with the tyngall and lost
him by mistake 

  a skeptical smile cross the old mans
face i have lived too long sir he
said severely to be gulled by trans-
parent falsehoods the tyngall does
not associate with common people 

  with that the old man turned con-
temptuously on heel and harry had to
resume the weary task of questioning
strangers but all without results no
one knew the way to the library no one
would believe that harry had actually
seen the tyngall many inquired his
number and being told that he had
none they spit in disgust or whirled
about and refused further speech with
him for a man without number was a
man without civil position an outcast
the lord of tranerica



a pariah a person beneath contempt

  from gallery to gallery harry wand-
ered a deep uneasiness gnawing away
within him while nowhere could he see
any sign of the library and gradually
the suspicion overcame him that each
step he took was bringing him further
from his goal

dewildered and disheartened
he slumped down on a stone bench
beside a fountain by now he realized
celia must be in agonies at his absence
she would imagine that some grave mis-
hap had befallen him and he him-
self as he thought of her alone in this
strange century with no one to protect
her but the tyngall felt half distracted
what would become of her should she
remain at the mercy of that unbearable
spratt who already as harry had an-
grily noticed had cast ogling eyes at
the girl

  but was there not still some way to
find the library was there no guide-
book to point out the direction with
this hope in mind harry leapt to his
feet again and hailed a passer-by who
proved most obliging but stated that he
had never heard of any guide-book a
second passer-by however offered more
definite information-yes indeed there
was a directory to all the day rooms
but where was it to be found the
man scratched his head and then
after a moment joyously gave the an-
swer the guidebook was in the li-
brary

  but since the informant like the
other hivites did not know the way to
the library harry found himself no
better off than ever

  disconsolately he started on his way
again through wide galleries branching
and interconnecting with maze-like in-
tricacy and apparently endless in ex-
tent after a time his attention was at-
tracted to a crowd of men and women
who stood hundreds deep before a little

closed gateway shouting and gesticu-
lating and furiously pushing and shov-
ing to get to a front position above
them on the wall a huge megaphone
projected and from it a bawling voice
proclaimed monotonously one only
will be required one only will be re-
quired form your lines to the left

  but far from forming lines the men
and women made only a writhing mass
squirming and squeezing with bruised
shins bloodied noses and blackened
eyes while fresh recruits came rushing
from all sides

  what is it a convention of luna-
tics harry asked addressing a sen-
sitive-looking tall young woman who
stood by with a faintly amused expres-
sion on his clear candid countenance

   i see youre a foreigner replied the
young man courteously a native
wouldnt have to ask questions what
you see here is a crowd of candidates
applying for a job

  applying for a job but i
thought-

  thought that no one here has to
work of course not but most of us
get so bored that when a job is open
we fight for it like maniacs theres no
pay naturally its merely something to
pass the time you see a few super-
visors are needed to operate the me-
chanical workers by radio control and
also some inspectors to look at the fac-
tories now and then not enough to
keep one man in a thousand occupied
thats why theres such a scramble
whenever a new job is open

i tarry had started to walk away

	with the young man whom he
rather liked while from behind him
rang the yells screams groans and
snarls of the rapidly growing throng of
job seekers

  whats your number sir inquired
his new acquaintance after harry had
vainly asked him the way to the library

  im afraid i havent any harry
was forced to admit

  no number a furtive expression
came into the strangers face he
pressed close to harry and whispered
into his ears neither have i 

  not for three years already he
added in barely audible tones in re-
sponse to harrys puzzled glance you
see im a dangerous radical i dont
like the tyngall system of government
i believe it leads to dry rot of the mind
and spirit theres nothing to do-
nothing to strive for its my idea that
most of the mechanical workers should
be scrapped and men put back on the
jobs thats what is called subversive
doctrine on account of my youth i
was paroled on my first offense with the
loss of my number the second offense
would mean death

  your views sound pretty sensible to
me declared harry guess im a
dangerous radical myself but what do
they call you if you havent any num-
ber

  my friends call me the lightning
bolt thats because im always so im-
petuous about everything

  my friends call me harry harry
mcnear

 mcnear harry mcnear what
strange antique-sounding words well
harry since were both numberless
maybe we can be friends

  the hand of the lightning bolt shot
out and harry took it warmly and
thus was sealed the bond of fellowship
between the son of the twentieth cen-
tury and the son of the twenty-fifth

  as the two wandered away together
a gong rang above them and signs of
excitement became evident among the
men women and children crowding the
shaded walks and lawns of the day
rooms the reason for their agitation
soon became visible in the shape of a
company of mechanical workers who
strode in carrying great trays heaped

with viands harry was reminded of
the genii of the arabian nights of
whom he had read as a child but there
was something more familiar in the way
the multitude swarmed forward each
person eager to be first in snatching the
delicacies from the trays

  whats the matter isnt there
enough to go around inquired harry
as he saw how avidly the people pushed
and grabbed not taking time to sit
down while swallowing the food by
great gulps

  more than enough replied the
lightning bolt its simply an old
habit-inherited from a time when they
say many couldnt be sure if they
would have butter for their bread the
same rush occurs three times every
day

  harry and his new-found friend
waited until the multitude had been
fed then approaching one of the me-
chanical workers helped themselves to
some vegetables fruit and cakes from
one of the trays

dut they had hardly finished their
 repast when they were startled
by the sound of a siren thats
the signal to leave the day rooms until
tomorrow declared the lightning
bolt well have to go up to our com-
partments for eight or nine hours of
sleep

  but i havent any compartment
stated harry

  no then theres been some over-
sight on the part of the mechanical room
clerk but dont let that disturb you
you can share my compartment if you
wish

  id be ever so much obliged if it
wouldnt put you out

  not at all i live in three rooms
with another numberless chap-weve
plenty of spare space having no num-
ber you see he added in a mournful
whisper naturally i couldnt hope to
the lord of tranerica



find any girl willing to marry me
while the lightning bolt was speak-
ing harry observed that several huge
gates were swinging open and that mul-
titudes of little cushioned cars were
waiting outside into these the people
began pushing their way trampling one
another in their haste but the light-
ning bolt who seemed a most sensible
person and did not at all live up to his
name gently took harrys arm and led
him in another direction lets walk
he suggested its simpler and saves
a lot of trouble

  the next moment he and harry were
springing side by side up long spiral
iron stairways

        chapter vii
        a fresh blow

 yes were pretty comfortably
located here remarked the
lightning bolt as he entered
his compartment and turned the electric
switch which threw a flood of subdued
radiance across three connecting rooms

  but harry as he surveyed those win-
dowless chambers which exactly resem-
bled the ones he had seen with the tyn-
gall was surprised to notice that every-
thing was as bare as a house after the
tenants have moved wheres the
furniture he demanded

  why just where it should be re-
plied the lightning bolt and pressed a
button on the wall instantly several
steel chairs unfolded themselves from
hidden niches and rattled into position
at the same time the lightning bolt
pressed another button and a table un-
folded from the floor while a third but-
ton caused a collapsible couch to clatter
into place

  you see everything is arranged for
convenience continued the proprietor

as he turned a screw and a faint cool
current of washed air began to blow
over them we cant expect to have
everything as comfortable as the tyn-
gall but we have little to complain of
in that line-no not in that line

  even as he spoke the door opened
admitting an alert little man with a
long intellectual face and keen restless
eyes

  oh ciph i was waiting for you
the lightning bolt greeted him i
want you to meet my friend hes one
of us-hasnt any number call him
simply kar-no har i think it is-
harry

  a strange name commented the
newcomer extending his hand but
im always glad to meet a numberless
man harry

  this is my roommate and best
friend the lightning bolt introduced
clapping ciph affectionately on the
shoulder since he has no number we
call him the cipher

  cipher echoed harry

  yes you see that indicates what
they thought i amounted to continued
ciph in a brisk voice after i lost
my number my old friends abandoned
me they called me the cipher in rid-
icule-and the name clung

  but how did you come to lose your
number

  oh i happened to get careless one
day i was having an argument with a
friend and the question arose whether
it was possible to conceive of a wiser
and more humane system of life than
that of the hives i answered with a
rash yes for sometimes i got tired of
seeing mechanical workers all around
me and would have lived to do things
for myself very incautiously i raised
my voice and was overheard and re-
ported my statements being construed
as a criticism of the government i lost
my number luckily i was able to
bring influence to bear with the judge-


dynamic science stories

which accounts for the fact that im
still alive

  criticism of the government is trea-
son explained the lightning bolt
usually the suspect is executed on gen-
eral principle hence the government
is not very much criticized

t tntil late in the night or rather
 the period that passed for night
since all time divisions in the hives were
arbitrary harry sat up talking with
his new friends whom he came to like
more and more as the hours wore on
he learned that both were secretly op-
posed to the tyngall and his adminis-
tration and that thousands of others
likewise were discontented but did not
dare to speak their minds in fact the
subject of revolution had often been
broached although nothing in that line
had been attempted for many decades
this knowledge however put a daring
idea into harrys mind-an idea on
which he was to act far sooner than he
could have anticipated

  the following morning after spend-
ing a few hours tossing on the spare
couch which his new friends had pro-
vided harry bathed in a fountain of
warm water and was shaved by a me-
chanical valet then accompanied the
cipher and the lightning bolt to the
day rooms where mechanical waiters
were passing back and forth with the
breakfast trays do you know where
the library is harry asked the cipher
as a matter of course when they had
eaten and was astonished to receive a
reply in the affirmative

  yes i often go there said the ci-
pher people think it dreadfully old-
fashioned of me

 show me the way demanded
harry although it was hardly to be
expected that after nearly twenty-four
hours celia could be found there

  yet to the library they hastened-
only to find the building empty

  dont see how on earth im going to
trace her now harry lamented feel-
ing as if the whole world were collaps-
ing about his shoulders for he had
cherished the hope that at the library
he would find if not celia herself at
least some message from her

  no i dont see how youre going to
trace her coincided the lightning
bolt who had heard harrys whole
story it would be as much as your
life is forth to try to communicate wdth
the tyngall

  but doubtless the tyngall will take
good care of her contributed the ci-
pher consolingly

  yes too damned good care mut-
tered harry

  at this point their discussion was in-
terrupted by a thunderous voice which
broke out with startling suddenness
attention attention attention all
hivites

  hastening out of the library they
found that the voice issued from a series
of megaphones high up on the wall

  the radio mumbled the lightning
bolt a little awed its only on state
occasion that the radio speaks like
this

  attention attention attention
all hivites repeated the megaphones
and people on all sides children and
adults alike halted in their chattering
and their games and stood staring with
wide-open mouths and gaping eyes

  there ensued a second of silence that
seemed almost unnatural then once
more that booming voice sounded from
the megaphones

  attention attention all hivites
attention a momentous announce-
ment and one of great good omen is
to be made by his preeminent high-
ness tyngall hannibal fairchild spratt
the seventh

  tyngall oh tyngall hail tyn-
gall cried the people in a confused
chorus while they flung themselves
the lord of tranerica



down and kissed the earth in token of
respect to their ruler

tv tow from the megaphones there

	 poured a different voice-and one
which harry thought he recognized

  my people i know that you will re-
joice with me on this day of great good
fortune i have tidings which will i
am sure bring murmurs of happiness to
the lips of you all for a long while
as you know my fate has been a lonely
one my well wishers have long urged
me to unite my lot to that of some fair
lady and so give the country a tyn-
galless as well as the promise of an
heir to the name and fortunes of the
illustrious family of spratt but until
the present moment unable to choose
among the countless superb daughters
of tranerica i have lived in dismal
bachelorhood now however i have
decided to change to a more blessed lot
my nuptials will be celebrated on the
thirty-first of this month

  the megaphone grew silent and the
people also remained dumb for a mo-
ment then as the full meaning of
their leaders announcement forced it-
self upon them pandemonium broke
forth there were cheers yells and
shouts tyngall oh tyngall hail
tyngall hail tyngall  tears glis-
tened in many eyes numbers of women
burst out weeping and many men
leapt about and damned with jubilant
cries

  in harrys heart also there was great
rejoicing thank god he reflected
now that the old devils engaged may-
be hell let celia alone 

  the number of the bride the voice
from the megaphones rumbled on while
every one once more stood at attention
may not be revealed just yet but she
comes needless to say of high and dis-
tinguished lineage her pedigree has
been traced back more than five cen-
turies in order however that my peo-

ple may early come to know and love
the face of their future tyngalless i
will order it to appear on the television
screen

  it was but the work of a minute for
some mechanical workers to enter and
erect television screens under the meg-
aphones and it was less than five min-
utes before a fair womanly face larger
than life-sized appeared upon the
screens with photographic distinctness
and in its natural colors

  as he gazed up at those features of
the innocent pansy-like grace and flow-
ing golden hair harry gasped groaned
clenched his fists and mumbled some-
thing that sounded like an oath his
day had turned black and blank the
face on the screen was that of his be-
trothed 

chapter viii
stroke follows stroke

ow my dear young lady isnt
it just about time you stopped
these foolish objections its
all right im told for engaged people
to quarrel once in a while but youve
done nothing but quarrel you should
have a better sense of the dignity of
your position

  up and down the glittering length of
the crystal room the tyngall stalked
his hands clasped behind his back his
brows comprcssed and scowling while
at one end of the hall a golden-haired
figure sat in a hunched position her face
buried in her hands her sobs coming
forth in half-suppressed spasms

  these tears dear lady are getting
very tiresome continued the dictator
ive always heard the female sex re-
quired much humoring and by the
great name of spratt havent i done
everything possible to humor you


dynamic science stories

however my patience has its limits
there are not many persons who would
risk exhausting the temper of a tvn-
gall 

  but i dont want to marry you i
never said i wanted to came a pitiful
voice from a corner of the hall

  nonsense dear lady a silly preju-
dice who wouldnt want to marry a
tyngall you dont mean to say youd
rather have that long-faced carrot-
haired ox-shouldered brute that accom-
panied you here from the twentieth cen-
tury

  hes not an ox-shouldered brute
denied the girl rising with fists
clenched and ysuve taken him away
from me youve hidden him i dont
know what youve done to him i went
him back i want harry back i
want him back do you understand
with one foot she stamped vigor-
ously on the floor while she stood facing
him combatively with flaming eyes

  who would ever have thought that
such a mcck-looking violet would show
such spirit meditated the tyngall
doubtless such wild and primitive pas-
sions were common in the twentieth
century but there is no use complain-
ing dear lady the date of the mar-
riage has been set the whole country
is awaiting the event harry is a little
incident you will have to forget
never denied celia again stamp-
ing on the floor

  never is a word you should not use
carelessly my lady sometimes years
hence when you sit on your high throne
the mother of tyngalls and tyngalles-
ses you will think back on these events
and smile at your youthful folly in
wanting to wed a plebeian meanwhile
in order to help you forget i forbid you
ever to mention this red-haired beast-
this harry as you call him

  and what if i refuse demanded
the girl glaring at him out of her in-
flamed tear-wet eyes

    refuse spratt took a stride across
 the room paused to light a cigarette
 brought to him by a moving hand op-
 erating in a socket along the wall and
 then turned coolly back to his intended
 bride refuse no one ever refuses
 the tyngall it just is not done dear
 lady there are-well there are meth-
 ods at my disposal

   you cant threaten me she chal-
 lenged standing up to him defiantly

 threaten you returned the
 a tyngall between puffs at his cig-
 arette thats the last thing i would
 think of this man of yours-this
 harry-would be the one to meet the
 bill as ive told you it would be very
 hard to find him since he has no num-
 ber-still if i ordered it we might lo-
 cate him in that case he would be
 sorry he had come to the twenty-fifty
 century

 celias face had suddenly gone white
 but you wouldnt she pleaded you
 wouldnt take it out on harry-
 why not dear lady naturally i
 should dislike extreme measures but
 if you cannot drive harry out of your
 mind i shall have no choice but to put
 him out of the way very regretfully
 of course-but very decisively

   celia gasped then sobbing once
 more hurriedly turned aside

   the tyngall stood looking after her
 with a vexed expression an accursed
 nuisance these women he muttered
 to himself but youve got to show
 them whos master

    after another puff at his cigarette he
 pressed a wall-button which sent two
 mechanical maids clattering to the serv-
 ice of his bethrothed then contempla-
 tively he crossed the room and stood
 looking out of the immense window
 down toward the hudson and the black
 titanic masses of the hives some-
 where over there he ruminated is
 this nuisance of a harry but he will
the lord of tranerica



not be there much longer unless his
friend knows how to forget very
quickly i

	 

  the tyngall would have been even
more displeased at the thought of harry
could he have witnessed certain events
that had occurred in the hives an hour
or two before

  after receiving the news of spratts
engagement and seeing the face on the
screen harry had wandered away like
one in a fog his head was reeling his
fists were clenched rage and terror
fought for mastery of his mind so
suddenly so unexpectedly had the blow
descended that at first he could not
grasp its full import he could only re-
alize with a blazing indignation that
celia had been snatchcd from him and
bewilderment and a sense of baffled im-
potence mingled with a bitter desire for
revenge

  in the confusion of those first mo-
ments he scarcely noticed where he
went or what words came from his lips
damn the tyngall he muttered
quite audibly to give some outlet to his
inflamed feelings damn the tyngall
blast his soul to hell ill get the dog
for this ill get him ill get him yet
he was hardly aware how crowds
gathered about him staring with wide
unbelieving eyes as he uttered these pro-
fanities nor did he take any note of his
friends as they hastened to his side and
muttered warnings into his ears

  for your lifes sake chided the ci-
pher have you gone out of your head
hold your tongue hold your tongue
silent if you value your breath
cautioned the lightning bolt what
has come over you that you want to
commit suicide

  may the tyngall and his kind be
damned forever swore harry still too
angry to heed any warnings the
cursed swine to lay his dirty paws on
my girl-

  most of the crowd looked grave and
shocked at this impiety one or two
gasped with horror but on several
faces smiles appeared and from some-
where in the rear a titter was heard

  hurry lets get out of here while
theres still time the lightning bolt
urged plucking at harrys sleeve in the
attempt to draw him away from the
throng

  but even as he spoke there came a
sound that made him stop short with a
groan of despair

   from the opposite end of the room a
bell began to clang with heavy metallic
peak as of a fire alarm sharp insist-
ent and continuous the niose was such
as to drown out all conversations the
mob as if petrified stood glued in their
tracks their eyes gleaming with excite-
ment their agitated murmurs inaudible
amid the din

  after about a moment the bell be-
came silent but even while the echoes
still vibrated ominously a distant
clanking was heard rapidly growing
louder

  by the crown of the tyngall ex-
claimed the cipher mournfully some
one has rung the treason alarm 

  but cant we still get away cried
the lightning bolt glancing about him
like a caged animal

  but the multitude hedged them
around with hostile hands uplifted and
malevolent eyes

  it was only a minute before the
clanking had grown to ear-splitting
proportions and half a dozen mechan-
ical grimaces and screeches and yells
gether furiously as if thus to make
themselves appear more terrible shoul-
dered their way forward guided un-
erringly by remote radio control they
formed themselves in a circle about
harry and his two friends and then be-
gan marching away with the three pris-
oners in their midst to the accompani-
ment of a loud thump thump thump


dynamic science stories

that sounded a little like the tramping
of an army behind them with com-
ical grimaces and screeches and wells
of derision the rabble followed and
stones and bits of earth came shower-
ing in their direction

  at the further end of the hall the
mechanical guards halted one of them
reached down and opened a circular
panel on the wall revealing a slanting
tube about a yard across while a sec-
ond drew forth three steel shells each
a little over six feet long and just wide
enough to fit into the tube like a key
into a lock they then thrust each of
the captives into one of the containers
after which there came a rattling sound
and the lid slipped down

   forced irresistibly into the little steel
box by the iron hands of the guard
harry felt that his last moment had
come as the cover rattled to a close
above him and he found himself in
utter darkness in a space so small that
he could move but a few inches in any
direction his heart leapt with terror at
the thought that he was being buried
alive and he called out with cries that
he well knew no one could hear and
beat against the steel walls until his fists
bled

  then suddenly he was aware that he
was in motion there came a swishing
hissing sound from outside his head
tipped downward and only his heavy
mat of hair saved him from serious
injury as he banged against the front
wall he rolled from side to side and
could not control his movements

in that bewildered terrified moment
 he had given up all hope it was al-
most with a shock therefore that he
felt his steel container grating to a halt
saw the cover slide open above him
and was greeted by the welcome glow of
clectric lamps

  still feeling stunned he arose a little
awkwardly and found himself in a

fair-sized room lined with intricate-
looking machines just in front of him
his two friends were also emerging from
steel shells both looked dazed and the
lightning bolt was nursing bruises on
his shins and arms but both like
harry seemed glad to find themselves
still alive

  it really was nothing declared the
cipher with a forced smile on his lean
sagacious face ive often heard how
terrible it was to ride in the pneumatic
tubes but after all its worth while to
have had the experience

  you see the tubes are ordinarily
used for freight explained the light-
ning bolt but sometimes as you
have observed theyre employed for
vicious criminals thats considered
part of the punishment

  wonder what theyre going to do
with us now mused harry as he
glanced curiously at the various ma-
chines that lined the room-machines
each about ten feet high with huge and
complicated dials a multitude of con-
necting wires and long ribbed steel pro-
jections and rubber tubes that wound
into the air like the feelers of an octo-
pus

  why theres no doubt what is to be
done next stated the cipher in a matr
ter-of-fact manner were to be tried

  tried

  certainly by the mechanical
judge

  one of the iron workers had come
clattering into the room as these words
were spoken and with swift move-
ments seized the left wrist of each pris-
oner and attached it to one of the pro-
jecting rubber tubes instantly little
wheels moved on the machines a low
growling was heard from within them
and the dials began slowly turning

  what do you mean by a mechanical
judge demanded harry while the
iron worker took his right hand and
made him hold a knob connecting with
the lord of tranerica



an electric wire

  a mechanical judge the cipher
declared represents the height of ju-
dicial advance now that all decisions
are machine-made we can be sure they
will be uniform quality we can also
be sure they will be swift efficient and
positive besides the mechanical
judge cannot be bribed

  no but they say he can be fixed
contributed the lightning bolt

  but how can you get decisions by
machine asked harry with a skep-
tical smile the thing is impossible
far from it denied the cipher
the principle is really very simple
why didnt they have lie detectors
long ago so far back i believe as the

twentieth century were merely en-
larged upon the same idea everything
that happens to a man you see leaves
its reaction in his nervous system and
in his blood stream each incident
cach thought arouses a faint electric
current-very weak it is true yet a
sufficiently powerful machine with
strong amplifiers can register it and
interpret it by its wave-length so if a
man has treasonous ideas-

iie was interrupted by a growl from

 one of the machines-a growl
which sounded exactly like that of a
bulldog

the mechanical judge is getting
ready for his decision remarked the


dynamic science stories

lightning bolt his hands fluttering
with excitement

 what is that the mechanical
judge cried harry pointing in
astonishment to the machines

  of course didnt you even know
you were being tried

  no i didnt realize it admitted
harry with a rueful glance at the rub-
ber tube attached to his left hand and
the wire connecting with his right and
then looking up with an attempt to be
cheerful he smiled bowed toward one
of the machines and continued face-
tiously i trust your honor will be
good to us

  a loud grumbling from inside the
machine was the immediate response

  sure the mechanical judge never
makes mistakes harry went on a
little nervously id hate to see the
wrong decision

  have no fear returned the cipher
mournfully they say his record of
convictions is nearly one hundred per
cent

  the next instant there came a sudden
snapping sound from inside the largest
machine and a red hand shot up along
with some crimson notations

  prisoner number i read an arrow
pointing in the ciphers direction zx
i    prisoner number  said
an arrow aimed at the lightning bolt
zx     prisoner number 
announced an arrow that indicated
harry zx 

  thats the decision of course
stated the cipher extricating himself
from the rubber tube and wire
theres a table at the end of the room
to interpret the code

  all three hastily made their way
across the room and could hardly keep
from groaning as they read zx 
guilty of treason in the third degree
confinement for fifty years    zx 
guilt of treason in the second degree-
confinement for life    zx  guilty

of treason in the first degree execution
in thirty days

       chapter ix
       the conspiracy

  a lmost before the three unfortu-
 nates had had time to grasp the
j meaning of the sentence pro-
nounced upon them they were herded
together by a corps of mechanical
guards and forced once more into pneu-
matic tubes after another bewilder-
ing flight through the darkness they
emerged in a long corridor marked in
huge black letters lower class
residential quarters not
until later did harry learn that by
lower class the sign really meant
prison population for the meaning
of the terms had altered in the course
of the centuries until the two were re-
garded as synonymous

  feeling like one who has been dealt a
stunning blow on the head harry al-
lowed his mechanized jailors to prod
him through several steel-barred gates
and one or two winding iron hallways
while the lightning bolt and the cipher
accompanied him with drooping fea-
tures and desolate eyes finally they
reached a series of large connecting
electrically lighted galleries or caverns
reminding harry of the day rooms
except that there were no lawns or trees
but only concrete floors and patches of
gravel and sand overarched by a high
vaulted ceiling supported by steed col-
umns in these spacious reaches thou-
sands of men and women were gath-
ered engaged in various tasks and pas-
times which seemed to harry to con-
trast strangely with the occupations of
the free citizens

  it tended to take his mind off his own
troubles to watch these prisoners who
the lord of tranerica



did not at all meet his preconceived con-
ception of jailbirds here a man
bespectacled and patriarchal-looking
would be studiously reading from a
hoary old tome here a young scientist
would be poring through a microscope
and making notes and drawings here a
painter would be standing with his pal-
ette and brushes or a sculptor with a
half finished bust while some of the
inmates were filling immense volumes
with pencilled notations others were
practicing at musical instruments and
still others were gathered into little
knots soberly talking

  from the finely developed faces the
massive brows the keen eyes of the
prisoners harry was at once aware that
these were persons of a different type
from those in the day rooms it was
evident at a glance that they were the
most talented the most intellectual rep-
resentatives of the twenty-fifth cen-
tury i

  is this really the prison asked
harry in wonder isnt there some
mistake-

  no there is no mistake returned
the cipher grimly this is the prison
all right

  or as they prefer to call it the
lower class residential quarters
amended the lightning bolt

  it might be all right for a few days
declared the cipher with a sigh but
as a resort for the next fifty years i
dont exactly fancy it

  think of me pointed out the
lightning bolt enviously i didnt
get off with a mere fifty years they
gave me life

  i have only thirty days groaned
harry thinking of his impending doom

  yes lucky fellow your misery
will soon be over returned the light-
ning bolt in a congratulatory manner

t dont know what hes done to de-
 serve such preference mourned

the cipher a swift and painless end
-electrocution by one quickly deliv-
ered radio bolt-and then nothing
more to worry about for all eternity
too bad too bad not every one can have
such good fortunte

 what do you mean demanded
harry more than a little irritated do
you think i came from the twentieth
century just in order to be electrocu-
ted

  there are worse fates than that
yes there are worse fates than that
sighed the cipher think of my fifty
years

  think of my lifetime moaned the
lightning bolt im only twenty-
eight and modern science has made
such frightful progress i may live to be
a hundred

  well im going to live to be a hun-
dred too-if i can find any way as-
serted harry do you think ill he
down and let myself be executed just
because a machine condemned me
not on your life ive got thirty days
yet-and a lot can happen in thirty
days

  not in the prison lamented the
cipher

  you mean the lower residential
quarters corrected the lightning bolt

  what im wondering reflected
harry as he looked out across the wide
hall at his multitudes of fellow victims
what im wondering is if some of us
down here cant get together and bolt
for freedom

  its no use mumbled the cipher
theres nowhere to bolt to

  still arent most of us pretty much
in the same boat harry went on dis-
regarding this remark

  same what same boat came in
one voice from his two friends to whom
this twentieth century idiom was un-
familiar

  i mean weve all got nothing to lose
but our chains any of these other


dynamic science stories

folks here sentenced to death

  about half i should say estimated
the cipher

  and the other half are in for twenty
years or over added the lightning
bolt the mechanical judge isnt
geared to give short sentences

  good  pronounced harry with en-
thusiasm as by degrees a daring plan
took shape in his mind then every
one here is our natural ally what if we
were to rise up all of us and strike
out-

  by the eyes of the tyngall not so
loud interrupted the lightning bolt
as he clutched warningly at harrys
arm

  no-if you dont want to die by
torture keep your voice down coin-
cided the cipher

  dont you realize the air tappers
may get you the lightning bolt de-
manded by their secret radio waves
they can listen in on conversations any-
where its getting so nowadays that
nothing is safe thats spoken above a
whisper

itarry glanced about him anx-

	 iously as if to make sure that no
one was within hearing distance

  it doesnt matter where you are
declared the cipher they can hear
you as well a mile away as a foot
anyhow youve got to listen to mel 
insisted harry in undertones and he
led his unwilling friends to a little hid-
den niche between two great steel pil-
lars and prepared to unfold his scheme

   ive got just thirty days to work in
he declared hastily but careful to keep
his voice to a whisper in that time
the tyngall has to be thrown down like
the rat that he is and weve got to make
ourselves the lords of tranerica
there have been others with the
same idea my boy nodded the cipher
drearily in most cases a well-aimed
radio bolt has ended their dreams

  why should it be a dream argued
harry dont you realize how vulner-
able the tyndall is why he depends
for his power exclusively upon the me-
chanical guards and workers 

  very true-and each mechanical
worker has from a thousand to ten thou-
sand man-power sighed the lightning
bolt

  yes but they are all controlled by
small groups of men are they not
harry went on hastily incautiously lift-
ing his voice so that his companions
had to warn him again the real rulers
of tranerica are the men that guide the
mechanical workers these are but few
in number if they were captured or
made to obey our will we could move
the mechanical workers as we wished-
and it would be we that ruled traner-
ica

  yes thats so in a way admitted
the cipher looking thoughtful the
only question is how to capture the
radio operators

  it reminds me of the ancient fable
of the mice and the cat contributed
the lightning bolt with a mournful
grimace were all nicely agreed to
bell mr cat-the only question is
which hero is to attempt it

  i dont call myself a hero but ill
attempt it averred harry that is
he added more soberly if i get coop-
eration one man alone cant move a
mountain

  well im with you swore the ci-
pher at the worst i may be rewarded
by speedy execution

  me too concurred the lightning
bolt im a desperate man with sev-
enty or seventy-five years looming
ahead of me i dont think you have
the shadow of a chance to win out but
if im lucky i may be caught and elec-
trocuted

  no reason you should be caught
denied harry and then drawing his
friends more deeply into the niche be-
the lord of tranerica



tween the two columns he glanced ap-
prehensively in all directions and re-
sumed the discussion in a whisper

  for several hours the conference con-
tinued while the three conspirators
planned weighed and debated grad-
ually a more determined light came into
the eyes of harrys two friends as
though they had been infected by his
enthusiasm gradually harry himself
began to show the signs of faint tri-
umph while his excitement suppressed
with difficulty slowly mounted and
there was a fierceness in his manner as
of a would-be conqueror

  the discussion was interrupted by
the passage of several mechanical wait-
ers bearing food-scanty and flavorless
victuals as compared with the abundant
repasts enjoyed in the day rooms but
with the compensating feature that
there was no wild rush to be the first
served somewhat later the lights were
put out and the prisoners were com-
pelled to spend eight hows of darkness
stretched out on the sand or gravel or
on couches of straw for the theory of
the law was that not been fully human
they were not entitled to humane ac-
commodations but all during the meal
period and a good part of the time al-
lotted for slumber the whispered con-
versation of the three plotters con-
tinued and by the following day their
plans had begun to take shape

pytfring the next week or two many
furtive discussions were held in
the lower residential quarters the
lightning bolt the cipher and harry
were seen to pass continually from place
to place accosting likely-looking fellow
prisoners and the discussions they held
always took place in some concealed
spot and were conducted in whispers
many of those whom they interviewed
it was later learned were converted into
apostles for the cause and began
preaching in undertones to their friends

and acquaintances large numbers of
whom in turn became ardent advocates
of the insurrectionary movement
since we are condemned to death or
worse than death was their argument
why not give our lives fighting but
they were cautious to keep all such sen-
timents scrupulously hushed and not
to gather in large or suspicious-looking
crowds in every heart there was the
dread that some mishap or blunder
some unguarded or treasonous remark
would betray the plans and condemn
the conspirators to the torture cham-
bers in every heart was the wild hope
that the seemingly impossible would
happen and the first successful revolt
in centuries would occur

  all the prisoners meanwhile weighed
and reviewed every detail of the design
examining and re-examining it so as to
avoid every pitfall and all looked for-
ward in apprehension and fierce longing
to the thirtieth of january the day be-
fore the tyngalls marriage when three
numberless men were to lead their thou-
sands in a desperate gamble with fate

chapter x
at the eleventh hour

forty-eight hours before the
time of his prospective execution
harry was carried by one of his
mechanized jailors into a large bare
black-walled room this was the
death chamber and here it was that
scores of wretches men and women of
all ages were miserably moping in an-
ticipation of the bolt that was to end
their existence some of these poor
doomed persons cowered in corners
muttering to themselves others ranged
restlessly back and forth still others
stood apart and prayed but in the
frightened glances and hopeless looks


dynamic science stories

of them all was written the mark of the
sentence that hovered above them

  meanwhile in the interest of what
was known as humanized killing the
final rites were being administered by
the mechanical preacher this was an
iron machine built to look exactly like
a man it was dressed in a long flow-
ing black robe and wore a white collar
closed in front it was equipped with a
mask which unless one approached
very close might have been mistaken
for a human face and it moved its
hands with measured gesticulations and
bent and unbent its creaking frame in a
manner that appeared most life-like
even its voice which came forth in a
melancholy drone seemed natural and
quite human and a stranger might nev-
er have known that there was a phono-
graph cleverly concealed where its heart
should have been and that this reeled
off any number of records in succession
owing to an automatic electric adjust-
ment

  repent and receive absolution for
your sins the mechanical preacher
was saying repent and receive ab-
solution  it is a long road that leads to
spiritual redemption but the punish-
ment which is being meted out to you
my brothers is for your own good no
less than that of the state-

  on and on in this vein the mechan-
ical preacher went never-endingly at
first harry found the long-winded mo-
notonous sentences quite annoying but
after a time he did not even notice them
and he was told that this was the way
with most of the prisoners in fact
some of them spoke of the preacher in
the most favorable terms for he served
as an anodyne for pain and helped to
put them to sleep

  for several hours after his confine-
ment harry walked restlessly back and
forth along the hundred-foot length of
the death chamber his eyes were
tense and excited they were filled with

an eagerness one might say an antici-
pation hardly to be expected in one who
was so soon to die he scarcely ob-
served his fellow prisoners but almost
constantly his gaze was on the great
clock that dangled from the ceiling as
if he were anxious for his few remain-
ing moments on earth to be ticked away

  at last a gong sounded with a hollow
note like the stroke of doom and a
voice through a megaphone proclaimed
visitin hour for the next sixty
minutes the inmates of the death
chamber may receive their friends in
order to exchange final farewells

n to sooner had these words been
spoken than the doors were thrown
open and hundreds of men women and
children came crowding in crying
shouting weeping and wailing as they
threw themselves around the necks of
relatives and friends and clung to them
with despairing arms amid the throng
of newcomers harry soon made out two
familiar faces and motioning to the
cipher and the lightning bolt he led
them to a corner of the room where
they could talk in relative seclusion
but in any case the commotion about
them was so loud and continuous that
there was little danger that they would
be overheard

  well harry demanded as much
with a movement of his lips as in actual
words everything ready

  all prepared to cut the wires
we have three men secretly sta-
tioned with steel-cutting shears

  how about the flash-lights

  a thousand of them are hidden
four of our comrades almost gave their
lives to steal them from the warehouse
when the mechanical guards were off
duty

  good and everybody is prepared
to strike

  everybody we but await your
orders
the lord of tranerica



  then let the time be the second
hour before the night sleep now go-
so as not to arouse suspicion

  good-bye-and may fortune bless
our enterprise

  may the helper of all good causes
be with you harry the risk is a
desperate one-but we may win out
before leaving harrys two friends
both flung their arms about his shoul-
ders and burst into bitter lamentations
-so as not to attract attention by be-
having differently from the other visi-
tors then without so much as a final
nod they turned and were lost amid
the multitude but harry smiling
brushed back his heavy locks proudly
almost exultantly and stood aloof in
one corner gazing out at the crowd
with a forceful expectant light in his
eyes

  it was several hours later when pan-
demonium broke forth outside the
death chamber in the heart of the
lower class residential quarter the
commotion began with the suddenness
of a dynamite discharge all at once
there arose a clamor of shouts yells
screams hoots and howls accompanied
by a noise of thumping banging and
hammering the occupants of the death
chamber rushing to the barred win-
dows were astonished to see hundreds
of their fellow prisoners marching in
rough military formation equipped
with sticks rods and poles which they
waved in air or knocked against the
ground or stone columns while crying
out at the tops of their voices but
most of all the spectators were amazed
to hear that sacrilegious call dinning
through the air down with the tyn-
gall away with the tyngall a new
government a new government for
tranerica

  hardly had the tumult begun than
another and more ominous sound was
heard in the distance there came a
booming as of thunder accompanied by

a rapid vibrant rattling as of a nest of
machine-guns in action and a company
of mechanical guards each ten feet tall
came roaring forward with the speed of
an express train the watchers at the
barred windows gasped in another mo-
ment they thought the machines would
scatter the rebels like toy soldiers some
averted their eyes not wishing to see
the red chaos of bodies trampled and
torn others cried out in apprehension
expecting in an instant to hear the yells
of the mangled and dying but just
before the crisis when the iron guards
were within hands grasp of the rioters
an unforeseen event intruded

yith electrifying suddenness the

  	 lights went out not so much as a
flicker of warning did they give they
flashed from existence to non-existence
with the speed of a fading meteor
blackness covered the prison chambers
-blackness absolute and unbroken ex-
cept where here and there a firefly
flicker shot from the eye of a flashlight
wavered uncannily through the gloom
yet from the darkness there strangely
fantastically rang a sound of merriment
-a burst of laughter wild and trium-
phant that rose in mocking peals and
reverberations like the glee of a vic-
torious multitude

  as he stood clutching the bars of the
death chamber harry caught the con-
tagion of that cry and from his lips too
there came something that sounded like
a laugh while his eyes as they gazed
out into the blankness exuded tears of
thankfulness the first step in the plot
long and carefully planned had been
accomplished the wires that supplied
the prison with light had been out and
consequently the mechanical guards
had been rendered useless for they
could be controlled only when seen
through television reflectors by the re-
mote operators they were now stand-
ing stiff and motionless mere inani-

mate hulks of metal which no man need
fear so long as they remained in dark-
ness

  while he secretly exulted in this first
success harry observed that the second
step was already being attempted he
saw a number of small flickering lights
rapidly approaching and knew that
each was a flashlight carried by a small
party of men then he heard a
furious hammering and banging and
was aware that the bars of the death
chamber which had not been built in
the expectation of any concerted as-
sault were giving way beneath the pum-
meling of the mob outside it was but
a minute before iron truncheons had
hammered down the doors and win-
dows and harry and his fellow con-
victs shouting with joy were received
into the arms of their rescuers who
burst in through the torch-lit blackness
like a conquering army

  then away they all rushed into the
wider chambers of the general prison
where mysterious movements and
bustlings were to be heard from amid
the darkness and shadowy figures
flitted back and forth like shades and
now they turned to meet a new menace
a glare as of a cluster of locomotive
headlights appeared suddenly out of the
distance and moved forward with diz-
zying speed accompanied by the clank
clank clank that told of the invasion
of a new company of mechanical sol-
diers

  side by side with the iron giants two
or three men were to be seen moving in
agile little cars guiding the troops as
they thundered forward was the revo-
lution to be nipped in the very bud
but no just when the advancing mili-
tia seemed about to crush the revolters
under heel the glare of the headlights
grew dim and vanished and the men
in the little cars glided over to the rebels
and mingled with them the insurrec-
tionists acting through one of their

number whose term in prison had ex-
pired a few days before had not
neglected the precaution of enlisting the
support of the flesh-and-blood workers
that controlled the mechanical emer-
gency troops

mow began the most precarious step
of all this way boys whis-
pered harry as some one passed him a
flashlight and with the cipher and
the lightning bolt at his heels followed
by swarms of other supporters he be-
gan moving through the dimness to the
extreme end of the prison where a vent
three feet across marked the termina-
tion of one of the pneumatic tubes
since the iron gates were locked and
were much too stout to be taken by
storm the pneumatic tubes represented
the only means of egrees from the
lower class residential quarters to
attempt to escape through these long
dark passageways would be hazardous
in the extreme there was no way of
saying where the men would emerge
or whether or not they might not all be
bottled up in a trap but since no other
means was possible the risk was one
that must be faced

  keep within touching distance of
each other-and be sure your flash-
lights are ready directed harry and
then without hesitation he drew down
the iron lid of the pneumatic tube and
crept into the darkness

chapter xi
the assault on hive w

it seemed to harry that he crawled
for miles through that close hot
lightless tube his only illumination
the feeble rays of the flashlight at
times the tunnel dipped sharply and he
was on the point of slipping and break-
the lord of tranerica



ing his legs in the abyss at other times
it rose as sharply and he could pull
himself up only by the utmost strain-
ing behind him he could hear his fol-
lowers panting one close after another
sometimes mumbling beneath their
breath sometimes growling oaths and
curses and he too felt like bursting into
profanity as he moved slowly through
the endless labyrinth what if he should
never find his way out at all what if
he and all his supporters should perish
in these mine-like depths or what if
one of the steel freight-carriers should
come shooting through the tube and
annihilate them all he well knew that
the electrical connections had been cut
making this impossible yet his mind
swam and it was not possibilities alone
that alarmed him

  but at all times one thought was up-
permost the thought of the tyngall
and of celia of celia bright and smil-
ing as when he had left her and of
celia struggling in the dictators arms
and it was the latter vision which
standing forth lurid and feverish in his
oppressed imagination dominated and
drove him on like a goad until he would
sooner have perished in misery than
have thought of turning back yet was
he not already too late to save celia

  it may have been after hours of
groping through the tube that the flash-
light at length showed a solid barrier
ahead and harry knew that they were
coming to a fresh phase of their ad-
venture to slip off the lid of the tube
and emerge would now be a simple mat-
ter-but where would they emerge
would they thrust themselves straight
into the waiting arms of their enemies

  for a moment harry hesitated while
he could hear his followers heavily
breathing behind him then with
painstaking caution he drew back the
lid of the tube a fraction of an inch a
circular slit of dim light became visible
and harry putting one eye to the aper-

ture gave a satisfied grunt and opened
the lid to its full width a moment later
he had slipped out into a broad faintly
lighted corridor which was unoccupied
and bare except for a number of large
cases piled up at one side

  its one of the storage rooms
stated the lightning bolt who had
come out just after harry good
very good theyll never look for us
here

  well now that were out of jail i
dont propose to let myself be taken
back alive harry swore which
way shall we go

tie glanced about him uncertainly

	 and since one choice seemed as
good as another he turned at random
to his left and began moving stealthily
along one of the walls with his follow-
ers pressing behind him in a long line

  for several hundred yards they
moved through the long deserted gal-
lery their steps were slow and muf-
fled their eyes alert for the sign of every
suspicious presence but no danger
signal appeared and they were feeling
just a little more confident when creep-
ing around a turn in the gallery harry
found himself face to face with a sight
that caused his heart to give a great leap
and his whole form to shudder involun-
tarily

  a corps of eight mechanical guards
each twelve feet tall stared at him al-
most within touching distance

  in a panic he was about to turn and
flee but the cipher darting up behind
him drew him back with a restraining
come come theres no danger these
guards are merely being stored here
and are not in use at the moment

  yes but they may be in use very
soon protested harry

  not if i can help it denied the
cipher and he approached the fore-
most giant and drawing open a little
iron door in its trunk revealed a num-


dynamic science stories

ber of glass bulbs like the tubes of a
radio these he battered to bits with
a steel rod while some of his compan-
ions performed similar services for the
other seven guards that will fix
them he said they are now about
as useful as a motor can without a mo-
tor

  or a man without a heart put in
the lightning bolt

  again the procession started on its
way through a long series of storage
rooms do you suppose they know
where we are do you suppose we are
being followed was the question on
every ones lips but nowhere was there
any sign of pursuers and it was as-
sumed that their escape in the darkness
had put their enemies off the trail

  as they crept on their way they took
time to examine the crates and boxes
piled about them in some of the cases
they found canned and dried goods
which they seized avidly and bottled
beverages with which they quenched
their thirst but what harry leapt upon
with a shout of especial joy was a case
of riflecs-a development upon the
old-time rifles-instruments as com-
pact and easily carried as rifles and yet
capable of discharging as many bullets
as machine-guns arming himself and
several score of his followers with these
redoubtable weapons along with a suf-
ficiency of ammunition harry for the
first time felt capable of facing attack

  just where do you think we are
he paused to inquire of the cipher after
they had wandered through other long
connecting storage rooms it seems as
if we might go on forever like this
without ever getting anywhere

  all the storage rooms are deep un-
derground beneath the hives stated
the cipher what we must do is try
to work up

a cting upon this advice harry led
his followers up several winding

stairways to still other dimly lighted
corridors which also served for storage
purposes but he was as uncertain as
ever of the way out and in his heart
a new fear began to gather-the dread
that he would waste so much time amid
these mazes that it would be impossible
to strike before the tyngalls marriage
to celia

  but when he was most tormented by
this thought a starded cry sent a new
wave of hope rushing over him see
that little green light down there-way
down there shouted the lighning
bolt pointing toward the end of the
corridor two or three hundred yards
off that means an exit

  yes-green is always the sign of an
exit affirmed several of the others

  when they had reached the indicated
point they observed a sliding platform
similar to the old-time escalators but
much larger which began moving upon
the turning of a switch and bore them
up several hundred feet they now
found themselves in a dimly lighted cir-
cular chamber from which numerous
hallways branched in all directions
while in the center stood a huge sign-
post with colored pointers to the day
rooms  to the mills  to hive
m  to the crystal tower  to
hive j  to hive w   but still
they saw no sign of any other living
creature

  good this is just made to order 
exclaimed the lightning bolt coming
up and clapping harry affectionately on
the shoulder were still in the hours
of sleep-or the nightime as i believe
you ancients called it thats why the
lights are all dim and the place is de-
serted well have to make the best
of our opportunity before the hours of
waking

  if we could only find our way to the
central office meditated harry that
is the room where the radio engineers
direct the mechanical workers by re-
the lord of tranerica



mote control

  then lets go to hive w suggested
the cipher i believe ive heard it said
that hive w is the place on the hun-
dreth floor if i remember correctly-

  yes thats it corroborated the
lightning bolt its the very nerve-
center of hudson highlands

  im afraid we havent time before
the hours of waking warned the
cipher as the long column started
stealthily away again if were caught
-well you know the probable end

  hastening his footsteps harry made
his way through intricate winding gal-
leries following a green line varied with
an occasional arrow that read to hive
w at any moment he knew the wall
bulbs might flash into brilliance me-
chanical guards might start clattering
toward him and he and his men might
hopelessly trapped it seemed a long
while before a large sign in dull red
announced hive w first floor
but the real difficulties apparently
only commenced when they started
the ascent toward the hundredth
floor

  the stairways narrow and tortu-
ous appeared never-ending they pur-
posely avoided the main passageways
and followed dim back-flights among
whose shadows each moment they ex-
pected to see some lurking foe leap up
thirty forty stories they ascended
then panting and half exhausted had
to pause for breath then once more
resumed the weary climb constantly
afraid that the reviving lights of the
waking hours would catch them un-
prepared

  can it be that the tyngall is laying
a trap and is waiting for us to step into
it they asked a little surprised that
they had not been molested

  but more and more they were be-
coming convinced that their escape
through the pneumatic tubes had been
unobserved

 i hey had a little of the feeling of
triumphant mountain climbers when
at length a sign announced hun-
dredth floor division of radio opera-
tion    this way directed harry
starting down a corridor bearing the
placard to the main headquarters
and he was congratulating himself upon
being within a hairs breadth of suc-
cess when suddenly to every ones con-
sternation a row of dazzling white
lights burst out flooding them with a
radiance as of daylight

  by tbe eyes of the tyngall
groaned the cipher the hours of
sleep are over 

   if we dont retreat like a shot well
be caught wailed the lightning bolt

   but where will we retreat to de-
manded harry blinking beneath the
sudden brilliance id just as soon be
taken face forward as with my back
turned

   if you dont hurry it will be too late
to turn your back insisted the light-
ning bolt making a sudden about-face
if you think i have any craving for
the torture chambers-

  caught hot-footed as spies in the
radio section-its a grade a offense 
lamented the cipher to be torn limb
from limb would be nothing by com-
parison-

   retreat at a time like this is the
better part of valor sighed the light-
ning bolt as amid a confused panicky
throng he began pushing his way back
with increasing speed

  run if you want like cowards
snarled harry seeing his whole revolt
about to collapse im going on
firmly grasping his riflec he strode
forward a pace or two while the others
wavered and halted then involuntarily
he stopped short with a gasp of dismay
a doorway half a score of yards away
opened and eight or ten gaudily attired
toga-wearing men dismounted from lit-
tle cushioned cars


dynamic science stories

  to harrys overheated fancy it was
clear that his conspiracy had been
tracked down-that the newcomers
were the first of a contingent of police
but if he must die fighting he was at all
events determined to sell his life dearly
darting forward again he pointed his
riflec threateningly at the newcomers

   he was a little surprised to note the
astonishment on their faces the look of
startled horror that possessed them all

  for a moment they stood staring at
him in amazement that showed just a
little of incredulity as if they could not
quite trust the testimony of their own
eyes

  what-what in the tyngalls name
do you do here the foremost of the
strangers at last demanded

  dont move one step-not one
step warned harry turning his riflec
toward the speakers heart

  what are you-a madman shot
out the menaced one indignantly

nd what are those fellow luna-
tics of yours bawled a second of
the toga-wearing ones pointing to
harrys followers who had rallied and
were drawing around with their riflecs
pointed what can they want of us
mere inoffensive radio operators-
radio operators harry echoed a
sudden light bursting upon him and his
head reeled at the giddy prospects that
suddenly unraveled radio operators
so youre the ones that move the me-
chanical workers

  yes-and youre keeping us from
our duties cried one of the victims
accusingly until you let us go not a
laborer will lift an arm in the mills not
a waiter will serve break fast in the day
rooms not a guard in the lower resi-
dential quarters-

  enough we have other duties for
you harry interrupted sternly for-
ward march-all of you into the engi-
neering rooms you will move the me-

chanical workers and guards-but only
as we say forward-unless you want
some riflec bullets through your heads 
the engineers hesitated but on all
sides they saw the iron muzzles pointed
at them weaponless and outnumbered
they had no choice

  muttering curses and scowling their
leader slowly stepped forward drew
a key from his pocket and reluctantly
fitted it into the lock of a door marked
central engineering room

  we obey-under protest he
barked at harry as he cowered beneath
the rifle but who in the name of the
green lightnings may you be

  me harry drew out his chest
and stood proud and erect an imposing
figure of more than six feet i should
advise you to be more respectful sir
in addressing the next tyngall of tra-
nerica

chapter xii
the ceremonies are interrupted

in the golden room of the tyngalls
palace the preparations had been
completed the heavy yellow met-
al which of old had been valued by
tradesmen and bankers but was now
used chiefly as an ornament filled the
spacious hall with its gleam and its
glitter gold-leaf shone from the high
fretted ceiling gold-leaf glistened along
the walls the wide polished mirrors
had frames of solid gold there were
golden trays and platters and tables
with gold tops the very chairs were
upholstered in gold-braided cloth and
the tapestries were gold-inwrought
while the busts and figurines that lit-
tered the room were of the unalloyed
metal

into this sumptuous hall early on
the morning of the thirty-first of jan-
the lord of tranerica



uary there filed a notable company
high-ranking dignitaries all of whom
bore in their veins a drop or two of the
noble blood of spratt came trooping
in clad in their dress-togas of shimmer-
ing lilac orange cherry or lemon while
their spouses with their pantaloons and
high-buttoned jackets of dignified
brown or gray as became the gentler
sex accompanied them sedately or fol-
lowed in little chattering parties bear-
ing gifts of golden flowers or of fruits
neatly fashioned in gold excitement
was in the air particularly where the
ladies gathered in their fluttering
groups    oh what do you think
shes like  i really dont care for
her picture    they say shes a for-
eigner-think of that    wonder
where he could have picked her up
   must be a very forward type
otherwise our tyngall poor susceptible
man would never have been taken
in

  such were but a few of the comments
whispered from ear to ear as the com-
pany gathered and at length formed it-
self in a crowd hundreds deep as time
went on gay strains of music appro-
priate to the occasion filled the air from
an unseen radio receiver huge floral
wreaths were borne in and a song all
hail the tyngall was sung by a chorus
of dozens of voices finally amid an
awed hush the chief functionary ar-
rived a man bearing the honorary an-
cient title of minister although he
had long ceased to have any religious
duties other than those of signing birth
certificates and marriage contracts
all clad in a glossy golden robe with
a tufted golden headdress and golden
sandals he strutted into the room with
a due sense of the dignity of his posi-
tion-so much so that one might have
wondered if it were not he rather than
the tyngall that was to be married

  time wore on and the guests amid
their chirpings and gossipings began to

grow impatient every now and then
the spectators would glance uneasily to-
ward a little gold-enmeshed door from
which the bride and bridegroom were
expected to emerge but the door did
not open and anxious speculations be-
gan to be circulated as the minutes
dragged away even the minister tug-
ging at his tufted headgear beneath
which he was sweating profusely began
to look irritated although of course
the dignity of his position forbade him
to make any remark

wtean while behind the little
gold-enmeshed door the dictator
stood glaring at his intended spouse
who sat hunched up in a chair her tear-
stained face buried in her arms

  come come dear lady he haran-
gued in tones of great annoyance this
is a fine way to carry on not for noth-
ing did the ancient sages call women the
most unreliable creatures that ever
walked the earth here the wedding
guests are all assembled and the most
elaborate ceremony in half a century
has been prepared and what do you do
-you weep yes weep and get your
face all red and ugly do you think i
want to present my bride in that con-
dition

  with an expression of disgust on his
pale puffy features the tyngall ran one
hand despairingly across his bald pate
while he took a deliberate stride or two
about the room

  a splendid way to start our married
life he went on youd better pull
yourself together i warn you-or
theyll be no happy days ahead for
either of us here-ill tell you
what-he paused long enough to
glance at the great clock on the oppo-
site wall ill give you just half an
hour in that time youll be able to
wash and powder up a bit and look as
the bride of a spratt should

but i dont want to be the bride of


dynamic science stories

a spratt  she sobbed

  nonsense dear lady the point is
too silly to be worth arguing when des-
tiny brings you a great gift the thing
to do is to accept it-and not question
whether you want it or not

  he was interrupted by a voice that
sounded through a little tube high up on
the wall your excellency tyngall
spratt i beg leave to inform you that
the guests are growing more impatient
unpleasant rumors are springing up
what shall i tell them now

  tell them the bride is still arrang-
ing the details of her outfit growled
the dictator recognizing the voice of his
secretary

  you see theres no use being child-
ish the tyngall went on turning back
to the sobbing figure if you dont
want to be presentable well let you be
married just the way you are

  beneath the force of this argument
the girl began slowly to dry her tears

  the trouble is grumbled the tyn-
gall as he ruefully eyed his bride-to-
be you dont appreciate me here
ive been mild and considerate and
never so much as pressed a kiss upon
you when i could have taken you by
force if id been anything like the vil-
lains of the old story books of course
no one ever is like that nowadays but
i suppose you still prefer this upstart
har-

  why shouldnt i prefer him hes
no upstart either proclaimed celia
beating her fists angrily against the
chair

  its lucky for him he has no num-
ber meditated the tyngall my de-
tectives searched for him everywhere in
the day rooms but couldnt find a
trace of him of course that was to be
expected-the detectives rarely find a
trace of anything but if we had caught
him-well by the blue thunders he
wouldnt have bothered u again
you never will catch him chal-

lenged celia hes too smart for

you 

  smart i dont know that word
oh you mean tricky well if ever i
see him again his tricks will get him
nothing he will regret the day when
his father met his mother 

  several minutes more went by while
celia drying her tears did her best to
resign herself to the inevitable if she
was to be married anyhow she reasoned
she might as well make a good appear-
ance as a poor one

dut she could not permit herself to
 take the tyngalls arm as the little
gold-meshed door was opened and
she entered the reception hall she still
looked tormented and strained yet if
there were any who noticed the tear-
marks on her face they thought these
perfectly natural in one who was so soon
to have the great happiness of marrying
a tyngall and besides a bride so
young and tender-looking was certain
to evoke favor particularly among the
hardier and more susceptible sex

  to celias senses the scene was like
a nightmare with the crowds of people
the excited exclamations the congratu-
lations the murmurs of awe and ad-
miration the glitter of bright lights the
glare of the omnipresent gold and the
atmosphere of formality that filled the
great elaborately outfitted hall it
seemed to her that she was living
through some fearful dream when at
the tyngalls side she was marched to
the center of the room while the crowd
made way before her and a figure in a
golden robe and golden headdress stood
on a little platform with a gold-bound
book which he gravely opened for
our text today she thought she heard
him proclaim let us take a passage
from the twenty-second century sage
halperi they that are united shall be
blessed surely nothing could be more
blessed than that mating now about to
the lord of tranerica



be consummated between the tyngall
of tranerica and one whom to judge
by appearances-

  the figure in the golden robe celia
afterwards remembered cast a benevo-
lent almost an endearing smile at her
she also recalled that there was much
more which he said about the duties
of a tyngalless and the continuation
of the great dynasty of spratt but
the next thing that she sharply recol-
lected had nothing to do with the gol-
den-robed one nor with the rolling
phrases that slid from his tongue

  suddenly-so suddenly that the
guests had barely time to turn and
gasp in consternation-a huge door at
the center of the room burst open with
a clattering sound there came the rat-
tling of steel and a corps of mechanical
guards each of ten-foot stature
thumped into the room while the
guests in terror scattered before their
advance they strode toward the tyn-
gall who gave one startled glance and
turned to flee-only to rush straight
into the arms of a second corps of mech-
anized giants which had broken in at
another entrance

  by the blood of the spratts its
treason base treason he barely had
time to cry and then while he strug-
gled helplessly in the arms of an iron
captor and the guests looked on with
equal helplessness the guards executed
a rapid about-face and went clanking
out bearing with them the distracted
tyngall whose cries could be heard
even after he had disappeared trea-
son treason by the blood of the
spratts its treason base treason

	 

  a month had gone by harry stood
side by side with celia in the crystal
room gazing out toward the dark tow-
ering masses of the hives one arm
was around the girls waist his eyes
had a whimsical sparkle and there was
something a little playful in his man-

ner as he spoke

  well dearest how do you like being
a tyngalless the tyngalless of all
tranerica

  seems i take to it just like a duck to
water she returned looking up at him
with a coy smile that is consider-
ing who the tyngall is

it was a pretty close shave at that

  	he meditated brushing back his
heavy mop of hair in which the red was
reappearing beneath the black dye
when i consider how nearly that
spratt got you-

  i was simply electrified she fin-
ished for him with an admiring glance
in his direction it was breath-taking
the way you burst in upon us after the
mechanical guards carried off the old
tyngall and then the way you ordered
the guests around with the guards to
help you and decided to let the wed-
ding ceremonies go on-with yourself
in mr spratts place i dont think
the minister would have married us if
he hadnt been so scared you could see
him shivering

  well he didnt have much choice
with the guards clattering all around
him  laughed harry my friends the
cipher and the lightning bolt were in
the radio room all the while making
sure everything was run properly by
the way im expecting them here any
minute im going to appoint the
cipher governor of south tranerica
and the lightning bolt-ill make him
ambassador to afasia

  harry took a stride about the crystal
room and raised his arms in a gesture
of exaltation its great to be a tyn-
gall he declared my followers-
you know the ex-prisoners-are estab-
lished in every radio room on the con-
tinent they say the land was never
before ruled so efficiently or intelli-
gently

  and thats nothing to what youre
i

	dynamic science stories

still going to do celia predicted com-
ing to him with a smile after all
arent you glad dearest that we came
to the twenty-fifth century

  it was the wisest act of our livesl
he returned gathering her into his arms
and then as he glanced down through
the fifteen-hundred-foot gulf to the
hudson and out across the interminable
black bulks of the hives and knew that
he was lord of this and of all tranerica
he heaved a deep thankful sigh if
only our friends in the twentieth cen-
tury could see us now he exclaimed
who would ever have thought we were
born to be a tyngall and a tyngalless 
meanwhile in the obscure depths
more than a quarter of a mile below an
unimpressive little man with a stumpy
frame bald pate and puffy face moved
unnoticed amid the crowds in the day
rooms his toga of a pale lavender
like that of many other males was not
such as to attract attention his eyes
were eager like those of a traveler in
a strange land who finds everything of
interest but his manner was just a little
bewildered as though he did not feel
himself to be quite in his element
from time to time when some one ac-
costed him and inquired his number he
would reply meekly i have none im
sorry to say-whereat he would turn
and go wandering away again like a
ghost among the shades of hades

  after all im not so badly off he
meditated as he rambled among the
lawny walks it was pretty decent of
the new tyngall to spare my life and
send me down to the day rooms be-
sides no one recognizes me here thats
because theyve taken my jeweled robe
but i was getting pretty much bored
with ruling anyhow its more inter-
esting here theres more variety be-
sides-come to think of it-i was
mighty lucky not having to marry that
weepy woman shed have led me a
devils life   

   the only thing im sorry for he
 went on is that my dimension machine
 was broken i would have liked to ex-
 periment some more who knows i
 might have projected myself forward to
 the twenty-seventh or twentieth-eight
 century of course i would have had
 to avoid the barbarian twentieth and
 twenty-first  

 a t this point his reveries were inter-
 rupted by a shout tyngall oh
 tyngall hafl tyngall 

   out of old habit he was about to
 draw himself up stiff and erect and look
 cold and official as he always did when
 hailed but the final word struck him
 like a chilling splash of water

   tyngall oh tyngall hail tyn-
 gall harry was borne to his ears in
 an excited chorus the cry was re-
 peated again and again and swept on-
 ward by a burst of mob emotion he

	found himself one of a multitude gath-
 ered before a signboard where a me-
 chanical worker nailed a printed notice 
 hivites of tranerica
 greetings after decades of inactivity
 the government has taken steps to rem-
 edy the unemployment problem it is
 not known how many billions are out of
 work but as fast as wc are able we
 are going to retire the mechanical work-
 ers from industry and give their places
 to living men applications for the first
 hundred million positions may be made
 immediately blanks are obtainable in
 all the day rooms tranerica shall en-
 joy a new deal

   heaven be praised  muttered han-
 nibal fairchild spratt the seventh as
 he hastened away to secure an applica-
 tion blank for the first time in my
 life ill have a real jobl

   his heart beat with such a rush of
 joy and there was such thankfulness
 within him that he scarcely heard the
 shout of the multitude as it repeated
 exultantly hail tyngall harry

tucked the wire mesh container
under one arm and leaped lightly across
the last of the jagged forty foot cre-

through his green quartzite headpiece

in the relentless sunlight as he ap-

brown little shapes clustered about the
airlock began to bounce and wriggle ex-
pectantly buzz grinned

  the reception committee he mut-

tered in amusement carson of gal-
actic makes big hit with mercurian
marbles oh well-hey take it
easy there rollie

  one of the excited rollies was bounc-
ing up and down gleefully joggling his
tough rubbery body against carsons
space suit in paroxysms of delighted an-
ticipation at the space scouts words
he subsided into a trembling ball of hot
leather rolled smoothly and easily to
the cruisers entrance carson laid
down his burden

  all right rollies he said good na-
turedly you know the rules around
here which one of you is todays
guest of honor

  the rollie nearest the airlock
bounced up and down exuberantly
the others rolled back wistfully
spread circle-wise about the cruiser
buzz took the tiny mercurian in one
hand

  okay he grinned come on in
pal and get cool

  he took up his sample crate and
pushed the button on the airlock the
other rollies watched him disappear
behind the wall of smooth metal then
swiftly rolled across the hard sunbaked
mercurian plain to conceal themselves
in ragged shadowy caverns

  inside the space-ship as buzz
stripped himself of the cumbersome re-
frigerated suit that life on the inner-
most planet demanded the guest rollie
tossed himself madly about the smooth
cool metal floor ballwise he propelled
himself around the room in giddy cir-
cles his tough little body slap-slapping
against the floor and walls in a frenzy
of delight as he reveled in the delicious
coolness of normal earth temperature
buzz chuckled as he watched

  youre a nice little guy rollie he
said even if you do look like a hot
basketball hows for a nice cool
shower

  the rollie bounccd crazily across the

floor bobbled about his bare feet

  wowl beat it youre hoti ex-
claimed carson he grinned again
all right my spherical comrade lets
go sprinkle ourselves with some good
earth water together the earthman
and the creature from mercury sought
the luxury of the spaceships shower-
room

duzz reveling in a riot of foamy
soapsuds and cool water dimly be-
came aware of another sound pound-
ing through the hiss of the shower a
metallic hammering sound as of
someone knocking at the hull of the
cruiser he pulled a wry grin

  hearing things he muttered
mirthlessly and no wonder after
two years alone on this blasted hotbox
planet sorry rollie no offense to
you and your buddies but-

  again the sound reached his ears
this time it was unmistakable there
was someone-or something-pound-
ing on the airlock but what who
on the lonely planet of mercury
buzz frowned if it was those darned
rollies-

  hastily he tossed a bath-towel about
his loins and strode through the space-
ship to the airlock he paused near his
workbench to pick up a metal meter-
stick then pmshed the lever that oper-
ated the lock from the inside the air-
lock wheezed and hissed swung slow-
ly open buzz stepped forward an-
grily

  i told you fellows he began impa-
tiently you could only come in here
one at a time ive got half a notion
to-

  his mouth stopped in midsentence
became a round o of astonishment
the figure standing before him was
that of a human what was more-
a girl human buzz gulped and turned
brick-red suddenly conscious of his
scanty bath-towel
the mercurian menace



  whoa hold everything he
gasped come on in and sit down ill
be right back clutching the towel
about him desperately he fled across
the floor to the shower-room to the
great disgust of the placid rollie he
snapped off the water flung himself in-
to his clothing and rushed back to his
visitor the rollie trailed after him
dispiritedly oozing cold water from the
deepset pores of his tough hide

   his guest had divested herself of her
heavy space armor and was lounging
now in the light graceful blouse and
shorts favored for earth summerwear
her hair was a rich and warm chestnut
bordering on auburn her eyes cool
and amused were like the cloudless
skies above mars about her slightly
wide deliciously curved mouth there
hovered a faint smile she rose and
extended an arm in the universal earth
sign of greeting

  hello exile she smiled sur-
prised to see me werent you or do
you always greet your visitors with a
meterstick in one hand

  y-yes stammered carson i
mean-oh no of course not i
thought you were a rollie i mean-
i thought the rollies were you oh
shucks what i mean is ive been out
here two years without seeing an earth-
ling and-

  the girl frowned momentarily her
keen blue eyes suspicious

  two years you say

  buzz caught that studying gaze and
grinned dont be alarmed im not
space-cuckoo-if thats what youre
wondering it was just the shock of
actually seeing another human being
that upset me for a minute and there
were a flock of rollies outside just be-
fore you came

  rollies what are rollies
thats my own name for them
buzz explained they are the natives
of this section of mercury maybe the

only natives here ill show you one
- he turned and called to his mer-
curian visitor who had rolled comfor-
tably under the electric refrigerator in
the galley hey rolue come on
out and meet an earth gal

 i he earth gal watched in wide-

	eyed amazement as the wet blob of
leather rolled pleasantly across the
room rolled experimentally around her
sandalled feet then bounced gravely up
and down as though to acknowledge the
introduction buzz patted the tiny
mercurian and pushed him gently to-
ward the galley passage the rollie
spun swiftly then whisked to his lair
beneath the refrigerator

  thats a rollie explained carson
tough little footballs-but friendly
the only possible form of animal life
that could exist here on the sunside of
mercury the mean daily temperature
here is  degrees fahrenheit-and
its always day since this side of the
planet always faces the sun

  the rollies leathery hides protect
them from the terrific heat of the sun
and their shape allows them to travel
safely over mercurys rocky pitted
surface and do they love coolness
ive been letting them visit me one at
a time ever since i landed here give
them a cold shower and youve won a
friend for life

  but-but he seemed to understand
what you said

  sure rollies understand every
word you say some sort of telepathy
i guess and theyre intelligent little
creatures but since they have no vo-
cal organs they cant talk back if it
werent for that theyd be darned good
company but say-who are you
where did you come from and
wheres your spaceship

  one at a time please laughed the
girl first of all im jeryl morrow
ore products investigator for galactic


dynamic science stories

metals sent out here to get your re-
port i arrived a half hour ago earth
time landed as near as i could to
your cruiser which i spotted from the
strato and walked over

  you know who i am then
naturally i know all about you-
except what you have learned since you
took over this station thais what the
company wants me to find out your
term is over next year and theyd like
to have everything shipshape for the
next mercurian scout

  suits me fine said buzz cheerful-
ly you cant imagine how good a
glimpse of old mother earth would look
to me right now seas and clouds and
snow and seasons and night oh
boy to see the sun go down for a
change and watch the sky grow dark
ive almost forgotten what the night
looks like

  thats strange you must have
seen plenty of night over on the dark
side of mercury

  the dark side carson stared at
the investigator in amazement then
slowly shook his head no maam
not mr carson lady he stays away
from the dark side of mercury

  im not sure i understand you
said the girl slowly you mean to say
that youve made no investigations
whatsoever on the dark side

  my dear young lady said buzz
seriously there are some things that
even a space scout doesnt go out of his
way to meet i mean those things
which dont concern him those things
that got henderson and frizell the
things that destroyed galactics dark-
side station in two weeks without even
leaving a trace behind the things
that flicker through the twilight zone
when youre walking near the border
do you mean youre-afraid de-
manded the girl

  afraid sister im scared stiff
absolutely petrified dont look so

surprised after all theres enough raw
ore here on the sunside of mercury to
keep galactic supplied for three cen-
turies why should i or any other
man tempt fate by going right into the
lair of the flame-folk

  thats not the point said jeryl
carefully the point is that your job
is to study the ores of mercury for gal-
actic not to spend two solid years sur-
veying one half of the planet you
viust let me have a report on the dark-
side metals

i isten said carson impatiently
 youre talking through your hel-
met i have detailed reports on all of
habitable mercury i have samples
and analyses of every kind of metal
that crops out of these rough hills and
plains i have assay fragments of gold
silver platinum iridium tellium from
the sun side it stands to reason that
the rest of the planet is the same but
ill take that for granted im not go-
ing over the border into the dark side
for any man-or for any girl

   jeryl morrow rose stiffly

  mr carson she said coldly ive
tried to be nice about this but youve
forced my position with your ridiculous
attitude now listen carefully i must
have a dark-side reporti you may con-
sider that an order

  carson rose his cheeks flaming

  i always knew he said angrily
that a woman in space was a woman
without brains now you listen if
you want a dark-side report you can
get it yourself and-you may con-
sider that a refusal

   the girls eyes traveled over carsons
well-knit body slowly when she
spoke her voice was mocking

  yellow eh i didnt think any one
man could be all they told me back on
earth that you were all right mr
carson-i will get that report myself
ill show you whether spacewomen are
the mercurian menace



fools and when i get back to head-
quarters well see what galactic has to
say about its great ace scout
carsons jaw set in a grim line

  if you know when youre well off
he ground out youll stay here-where
its safe

   ill go where i choose said the girl
firmly she stepped into her space
armor deftly stood before carson her
voice was metallic through the com-
munication unit of her helmet youll
not change your mind

  no

  very well then jeryl morrow
strode to the airlock you might turn
on your short wave to  im going
into the dark side to establish a research
base ill let you know how im making
out goodbye mr carson once
more the airlock wheezed asthmatically
as she stepped into it buzz took a swift
step forward

  miss morrow he cried but there
was no answer the outer port clanged
shut grimly buzz strode to his in-
strument panel snapped on the short-
wave radio a slightly chilled ball
rolled lazily across the floor and nestled
at his feet the rollie

  oh you demanded carson fierce-
ly are you all one sex or are there
female rollies too

  the rollie wriggled fretfully buzz
sighed

  well-i guess it doesnt make any
difference he said a gal rollie
wouldnt have red hair anyway or a
rotten disposition like you i mean-
he suddenly shouted in the general di-
rection of the radio the radio hummed
and spluttered then as if in answer
to his comment he heard the cool voice
of jeryl morrow

  are you timed in mr carson
very well leave your dials where they
are im taking off now for the dark
side there came a light taunting
laugh to see your bogeymen youll

hear from me later  

  hey for goodness sakes-stop it
what the-

  buzz stared in shocked bewilder-
ment the rollie seemed to have sud-
denly gone mad no longer quiet and
relaxed the tiny mercurian began to
pound up and down before him in a mad
tattoo

  tap-tap-tap his leathery little body
sounded on the hard metal floor tap-
tap-tap

  arson stared then suddenly he
- recognized that there was more
than mere chance there was some in-
tended meaning behind the frenzied ac-
tivity of the speechless ball something
had excited the little visitor to an un-
usual extent could it be the radio
something jeryl had said about the
dark side

  swiftly he whirled on the bouncing
mercurian

  rollie-what is it something
about the dark side you want to
know

  the rollie lay quiet quivering with
suppressed excitement

  bounce once for yes and twice for
no ordered buzz now-is it about
the dark side rollie

  the rollie bounced once emphatical-
ly then subsided into tense quiescence

  danger there continued buzz
frantically

  again his little friend bounced a sin-
gle loud tap

  what kind of danger from peo-
ple-oh darn it rollie if you could
only talk wait a minute i have it
if i follow her can i help will i be
able to protect her

  tap-tap ominously

  then what    how    eagerly
carson clutched at a tenuous straw
can you help her rollie

  a deliberate tap followed by a rapid
tap-tap


dynamic science stories

  yes-no buzz frowned then
i see not you alone-but you and
your brothers is that it

  breathlessly he watched as the rollie
tapped once then he began to throw
himself into his space armor the rol-
lie rolled eagerly to the airlock
waited there expectantly within sec-
onds the two were standing on the hot
dry plain outside the cruiser shrilly
carson whistled in answer to the
earthmans signal from a hundred
rocky caverns in the stark desolation
came swiftly rolling brownish balls
over hubble and detritus from crevice
and cranny the tiny rollies tumbled
and bounced their way to the space
cruiser they paused in a thickly
strewn circle before the earthman wig-
gling curiously carson wet his lips
he felt silly standing there talking to
a group of hot little basketballs but be-
neath his sense of the absurd was a
stronger force fear

  rollies he said somethings
wrong im not sure i understand what
it is-but your brother here does a
girl from earth a newcomer here has
just gone over to the dark side of the
planet

  a quivering shudder seemed to course
through the leathery horde taut nerves
tightened in buzz

  i understand that you rollies are
able to help her will you do it

  there was a surging forward move-
ment as the rollies with one accord
tossed toward him carson plunged the
key that controlled the airlock hot
brown balls jiggled about his feet
crowding into the ship

  come on then shouted buzz
pile in were going after her into
the dark side

  there was a dreadful sort of jest in
the way that cheerful voice spoke in-
termittently over the one-way radio
standing by the controls buzz ground

his teeth helplessly as he listened to
jeryls mocking taunts

  -nearly through the mountains
now and its too bad youre not with
me carson they are quite a sight as
they flame crimson and gold in the
brilliant sun i hope youll find time to
study them sometime but perhaps
they are too near the twilight zone to
suit you-

 i he ship was throbbing with vibra-
a tion its usual stability disturbed by
the mad acceleration carson was jam-
ming through the rocket jets the main
tubes of the space cruiser were flaming
spouts of fire in the mercurian strato
the ship itself a flashing streak of silver
arcing above the tiny metal planet
great motors whined and groaned as
buzz shoved the control lever to its
highest acceleration notch

  -can see the twilight zone ahead
now continued the undisturbed voice
strange i should have expected some
sort of vegetation here but there is
none and i can see a thin black line
ahead now carson with darkness hang-
ing above and beyond it like a velvet
curtain that reminds me-you wanted
to see the night again didnt you i see
it now perhaps you should have come
with me-

  through the pcrilens carson caught
a glimpse of the small rapidly moving
spaceship her ship ahead of him
and moving swiftly toward the dark-
side boundary a great exultation
swept over him he might make it he
might succeed in stopping her before
she crossed over grounded on that in-
hospitable macabre terrain   

  -am turning off the refrigerating
unit now and switching on the heat
no bright sunshine here carson it is
growing quite dark-

  she had made it then she was
through the twilight zone on the dark
side
the mercurian menace



  damn you cried carson to the
radio damn your beautiful stubborn
jets turn around come back
dont try to land there

  -but it isnt entirely dark-
there was an odd strained note of hes-
itancy in the girls voice the rollies
piled in heaps of spherical brown beside
carson in the control room quivered as
a solid body one bounced explo-
sively to the ceiling -there are
strange little green flares moving
through the blackness odd a sort
of st elmos fire i suppose or a sort
of cold will-o-the-wisp at any rate i
understand what caused your fear of
the flame folk carson but you were
wrong i can see them quite plainly
now they are not beings at all just
a phenomenon of the cold-

  carson groaned and tugged vainly at
the already strained controls oh for
one more burst of transcendent speed
all too well he knew those green
flares knew what they could do
anyway he had been a member of
the party that had gone out to find out
what had become of hendersons ill-
fated dark-side base he had seen
from above those seared black cicat-
rices on the bleak rimy soil of the dark-
side had seen-and shuddered had
understood-and returned to the safe-
ty light and warmth of the sun-side
if this girl landed her ship   

  jeryl he cried but even as he
spoke he knew his words were vain
she too was speaking from the radio

  -am landing now said that
laughing voice i must sign off for a
moment ill be with you later-
suddenly the cab of carsons cruiser
was thick with darkness through im-
penetrable black his fingers groped for
the light switch snapped it on he
too was through the twilight zone he
had reached the blackness of the dark-
side but would he be too late
swiftly he clicked on the search beam

swung its wide arc groundward search-
ing for jeryls ship

  one of the rollies was bouncing
against his legs insistently he looked
down all of the others were herded
by the airlock their massed brown
bodies strangely comforting sights in
this strange frozen silence carson
nodded his understanding they
wanted to be pleased instantly at the
moment the other ship was sighted he
turned back to his controls knuckles
white on the propulsion rod

 i hen suddenly a loud scream tore
a through the narrow control room
jeryls voice raised in horror

  carson buzz help there was
a moment of frying static then buzz
-you were right they are alive
the green things i mean i can see
them through my peruens clustering
about me hundreds of them they
seemed to be gathering now theyre
moving toward the spaceship

  and my controls wont work buzz
-theyve gone dead on me the
lights are out out its a dreadful
sea of blackness and those green
flares moving toward my ship-

  great beads of perspiration dripped
coldly from buzz carsons forehead
his strong hands trembled on the pro-
pulsion rod helpless trapped by
that damned green horde but where
in the name of the nine planets-
where

  his eyes glued to the perilens
caught a fitful gleam of baleful green
hastily he swung the ship toward the
hideously glowing patch of color it
was she it was the grounded ship-
encircled by the flame folk from the
frigid hell of the dark-side

  carsons hands steel-tensed as the
claws of a robot swung the ship into a
hovering circle the flaming rocket-
tubes choked and died suddenly as
carson swept down like a shrieking de-

mon of vengeance

  no time for a careful landing al-
ready the radio was spitting and fizzing
with an excess of static the words of
the girl coming through fitfully -not
afraid to die    but    should
have believed what you told me   
buzz  if i had only- then the
ground was a tangible force rising up
to smash at the ship recklessly buzz
shot a staggering repulsion beam from
the nose jet the ship jolted reeled
   then settled to the ground with a
grinding bump

  in a flash carson was at the airlock
his hand on the release lever the door
swung open then suddenly a tough
solid object strudk him heavily on the
breast bowled him over like a ten-pin
one of the rollies

  and carson saw the meaning of this
crude warning this was their fight-
not his dazedly he crawled back to
the control room focused the perilcns
on the ragged shelf of the mercurian
dark-side landscape

  across a bleak and desolate frozen
plain not fifty feet distant from his own
cruiser was the other space ship a
dark sullen mass unlighted and grim
about it circling in an ever-narrowing
net a host of the greenish flame-folk
stood their ghoulishly phosphorescent
bodies flickering pallidly against the
dreadful umbra tall as two men they
were slim ever-changing wisps of
light that glimmered like the cold fox-
fire of distant earth

  from their tractile bodies strange
pseudopods of flame licked out again
and again ghastly emanations that
simulated the limbs of flesh-and-blood
creatures there was no recognizable
substance or shape that composed
them only a constant flux of quaver-
ing motion somehow baleful and
threatening their light was a light that
cast no gleam among them it seemed

self-contained the light of absorption

  the unbroken circle that had sur-
rounded the other ship was ruptured
now some of the flame folk had no-
ticed the new cruiser already a tiny
group of the green flame-folk were mov-
ing across the metal plain to investi-
gate there was a quivering excite-
ment in the creatures fitful gleaming
a sort of greedy licking hunger in
their cold presence

a chill of repugnance swept
 through carson then he swung
the perilens around to sight the airlock
of his own ship

  darkness black deep impenetra-
ble darkness buzz gnawed his lips
had the rollies come out were they
somewhere in that dismal void organ-
izing forming their ranks for some
strange warcraft he could not see
them anywhere those bouncing bub-
bling little spheres of friendliness-
what had happened to them

  then suddenly amazingly some-
thing happened one of the green
flame-folk the nearest of the investi-
gating party approaching carsons ship
writhed as though in a convulsion of
pain writhed into a towering spiral
of greenish flame that twisted into the
black sky-and disappeared

  and in its place another figure ap-
peared a flame of warm ruby light
that pulsed and glowed with a fervor
like-like that of an avenging host
buzz gasped it was impossible-but
it was true this must be the work of
the rollies the battle was begun

  another of the green flame-folk shot
rocketlike to a streaming spiral of curl-
ing pain quivered and collapsed into
a glowing red flame and another
   and another suddenly there was
panic amongst the handful of invaders
and like gaunt will-o-the-wisps the few
about carsons cruiser swept back to-
the mercurian menace



ward their fellows

  there was a congealing of the horde
of green demons a baleful conference
of evil wavering tentacles of spirit
light hovered about the dark-side in-
habitants and an ominous pulsating
strength shuddered through their ranks
one of the green flares uncurled him-
self from around the prow of the girls
cruiser where he had embraced the
spaceship smooth metal was charred
and blackened burned deep in a chan-
neled groove

  jeryls voice suddenly bell-like and
clear spoke from the radio

  buzz your ship i see it in my
perilens then you came but whats
happening the green things are going
away what are those red flames
are they enemies too or friends
did you bring them there was a
moment of silence then the girls voice
broke suddenly with horror buzz-
my ship its been broken burned
into the air is leaking

  agonizedly carson waited for her
next words cold sweat beaded his
forehead a clutching hand was at his
throat

  im putting my space suit on came
the voice once more im going to try
to make it-through them-to your
ship if i fail-

  then carson acted like a madman
he tore toward the airlock waited im-
patiently as the lock operated to loose
him to the frozen metal plain rollies
or no rollies he had to get into this
fight too jeryl could never get
through that macabre green host alone

  he reached the plain outside
thankfulness touched his heart that the
gravity of mercury was so slight that
sturdy earth muscles even hampered
by the leaden weight of a space suit
could carry one enormous distances at
a single leap

  in-the flood of the searchlight he saw
the girls slim figure stumble from the

airlock of the other ship he bounded
toward her a wavering green light
flickered toward him he eluded its
tactile fingers scarcely knowing why
another step now   

  then the greenish flare enveloped
him for a fraction of an instant-and
his senses reeled pain sharp and in-
describable flooded him to the roots of
every nerve he was numb numb
and cold with an unearthly coldness
his feet failed him he fell forward
on his face drained of every ounce of
energy

a blinding flash of color flamed
before him the brilliant corus-
cating color of giant forces met in
mighty conflict suddenly the cold-
ness left him as his green attacker left
to join the rest of the green horde which
en rnasse was advancing to meet the
ruby-colored invaders

  instantly the dismal landscape was
lit with the ghastly flares of unearthly
combat fulgurant streamers of fire
were flung to the skies as the forces of
the baleful flame-folk struck back
against the strange necromancy of the
rollies pallid green and scintillant
ruby met in beams of blinding energy
swayed and tossed like maddened fin-
gers of light shattered into dripping
sparks of blazing color

  here a gigantic green unit swallowed
its reddish foe gleamed strangely with
an inexplicable color beyond the spec-
trum and shimmered into caliginous
gloom there an omnipotent pillar of
ruby fire whirled like a gigantic spout
of flame into and through the massed
green horde striking absorbing de-
stroying all that stood in its path from
out of nowhere a flame of red would
emerge darting swift as light to the
very heart of the fray

  like a thousand lightnings the war-
riors from the mercurian antipodes met
flamed and died in that titanic struggle


dynamic science stories

and ever inexorably the pulsing glow
of the ruby flames spread as the green
horde dwindled doggedly stubbornly
the dark-side demons fought at first
then as one by one of their fellows
writhed into spires of stricken flame
died and emerged as red foes to turn
upon their own brethren the remaining
few retreated until the battleground was
clear of all save the ruby flames

  and as the last of the green horde
disappeared into the black depths car-
aon was on his feet again stumbling and
panting to the side of the girl stum-
bling because all about him strewn like
giant pods were the inert leathery bod-
ies of the rollies and about him too
warm and protecting were the flame-
giants of ruby that the rollies some-
how had managed to loose  

  buzz jeryls glad cry was sweet
in his ears even distorted through the
metallic eardrums of his helmet swiftly
he gathered her into his arms together
they moved toward the cruiser a tear
choked the girls voice as they passed
one of the tiny rubbery balls

  the rollies she said they saved
us-but they lost their lives in doing it
and all because i was stubborn

  but we did not lose our lives said
a quiet gentle voice our lives are
eternal indestructible we are here

  carson and the girl stared at each
other suddenly realizing the same
thing no voice had spoken to them no
real voice a thought had entered their
minds and before them slowly revolv-
ing was one of the ruby flames that had
conquered the green flame folk from
its glowing depths emanated the waves
that came to the mass thoughts

  yes this is our true form buzz
carson continued the thought we
are really as you see us now-creatures
of positive electrical energy our foes
and hated enemies were the green folk
of the dark side-creatures of negative

energy ours is the more progressive
race the more peace loving that is
why many centuries ago we developed
for ourselves those bodies in which we
live on the sun-side of our world por-
ous leathery bodies through which we
can freely absorb the life-giving wealth
of the sun

  of course as rollies the pulsat-
ing pillar continued whimsically we
cannot do some of the things we used
to do in the ancient days of our planets
grandeur we cannot talk-or visit the
planets as we used to centuries ago-

  jeryl clutched carsons arm

  visit other planets she cried
buzz-its almost incredible but it
must be true remember what some
of our old legends and religious books
tell us about strange visitors that
came as a cloud by day and a pillar of
fire by night

  arson whirled eagerly on the
 ruby entity -is that true were
you the ones who-

  but there was no answer slowly
easily the rubv creature was seeping
into the porous hide of one of the inert
rollies that lay strewn on the frigid
plain all about them others of the
red warriors were seeking their sun-
side shells suddenly the plain was
alive with a host of tiny tossing brown
bodies that rolled briskly toward the
airlock friendly little creatures rol-
lies once more buzz grinned

  all right boys he shouted cheer-
fully if thats the way you want it to
be-youre the boss and from now
on the shower-room is open all day
long

  buzz- jeryl began hesitantly

  woman buzz catson silenced her
brusquely will you hurry up and get
into the cruiser ive been two long
years alone on this planet-and ill be

 behind those frau terrestrials roared a volcano from the sulphur pits and ruthless slave-
 masters of jupiter-while  miles ahead was max bredeur head of interplanetary
 transport lines end the vicious racketeer of uranlan slave traffic who had sentenced them

  to this living hell

furtively alan sarett peered
through the heavy murk of the
jovian prison pit a cloud of yel-
low steam writhed upward from the
boiling spring at his feet obscuring
everything with a choking sulphurous
veil he caught a hazy glimpse of jon
cory lank and raw-boned stripped to
the waist toiling steadily on the oppo-
site bank of the pool then a shrill
peremptory note came from the throat

of the jovian guard and a wire-thin
tentacle lashed viciously across his
naked back cutting deep alans face
wrinkled like the snout of a snarling
dog and he bent over the bubbling
spring tearing savagely with a long
daw-tipped instrument at the crust of
sulphur forming continuously on the lip
of the caldron a heap of the lemon
yellow fragments lay behind him

  through slitted lids he glared up at


dynamic science stories

the mighty figure of the jovian hatred
burning in his eyes damned sluur-
hed pay for that-and soon theyd
planned everything-he and cory and
parker and the uranian tull-and be-
fore many minutes passed theyd hear
the signal    the signal the roar
of the supply ship from io-and this
sluur would boil in the sulphur pool
and theyd be heading for freedom 
freedom-and max brodeur

  his ears strained for the first sound
of the supply ships rockets a tenseness
creeping through him and even as he
labored he watched the yellow-skinned
guard to be ready when the signal
came formidable antagonists these
giant brutes with their tremendous mus-
cles it was no joke for two terrestrials
-or even a half dozen-to attack one
of them ten feet above the obsidian
surface of the pit this sluur towered
his great bulbous body supported by
three mighty multi-jointed limbs termi-
nating in immense sucker-discs his
head if it could be called a head was
merely an elongation of his body and
the bare expanse of flesh was broken
only by a single huge eye faceted like
an insects and an enormous toothless
mouth from the top of his head pro-
jected six long wiry tentacles-and it
was these that alan feared most for in
them lay the strength of spring steel

  suddenly sarctt stiffened his fingers
fiercely gripping the handle of his sul-
phur-hook far above a faint pene-
trating whine cleft the heavy jovian
atmosphere cutting down through the
haze in a steadily mounting roar the
signal he spun toward his guard-
lashed out and up mightily with his
hook aiming at the gaping mouth like
a crimson gash in the smooth yellow
face and the blow landed i blood
dark and viscous spurted from a long
ragged wound

  a scream like the wail of a siren burst
from the sluur losing itself in the space

ships roar and his tentacles quivering
with pain and wrath swept toward sa-
rett alan tried to leap back out of
reach but in the terrific gravitational
pull of the giant planet he could barely
raise his feet from the ground coiling
cinctures of crushing sinew seized legs
waist throat and he was whipped high
into the air

  cory corp he gasped and with
a final desperate lunge he buried his
sulphur-hook in the top of the jovians
head the clutch of the tentacles tight-
ened convulsively and alan felt them
sear into quivering flesh felt the one
about his throat grind deeper and deep-
er obscuring his sight with a creeping
blackness

  consciousness was only a ghostly
thread when he heard a shout rise above
the dying roar of the supply ship and
the life-draining grip of the tentacles
relaxed the sluur shook under a hail
of thudding blows-and abruptly alan
was hurled to the floor of the pit agony
crawled through every nerve he
wrenched the sulphur-laden air into his
burning lungs with great rasping gulps
he knew his mind was spinning toward
the black empty chasms of uncon-
sciousness and he struggled furiously
to keep his senses

  somehow he found himself swaying
on legs as weak as woven straw a
dozen feet away he saw the jovian a
horrible monstrosity blotched with
slow-flowing blood crouching on wide-
spread limbs striving to ward off the
gouging slashes of corys weapon
abruptly he fell forward on the crim-
son ruin of his face-and a twitching
tentacle wound itself around the ter-
restrial a single note of triumph
shrilled from the dying monster-and
he began to creep toward the boiling
pool

  in wide-eyed horror alan shuffled to-
ward the struggling pair though the
weakened slmtr moved slowly his own
mutineers of space



pace seemed slower retrieving his fal-
len sulphur-hook without pausing he
pushed steadily ahead they were
fighting on the very brink of the spring
now cory desperately striving to free
himself then alan reached them-
and with a single mighty swing he drove
his weapon through the bulging eye
deep into the jovians brain

  cory wrenched free the sutur
sagged in death he teetered on
the sulphur-crust for an instant then
slid over the edge-vanished in the
depths of the churning expanse

  panting heavily the two men faced
each other cory angular homely six
feet tall sarett shorter by six inches
black haired rather swarthy a figure
of stocky power both streaked and
splashed with blood their own and the
jovians from head to sandaled feet
as one their hands shot out meeting in
a strong wordless clasp

  cory broke the awkward silence a
swell push-while it lasted he said
grinning broadly and now i think
wed better blast off

  sarett nodded right itll take
parker and tull longer to get to the
wall but theyll probably get rid of
their sluur quicker than we did

  like men on snow shoes they started
across the pit sliding their feet over
the glass-smooth surface the muscles
of their thighs were corded and rigid as
they struggled ahead with laborious
haste neither spoke breath was too
valuable to be expended in speech and
each was busy with his own thoughts-
thoughts awakened by the freedom
which seemed almost within reach

  two months ago they had been
brought to jupiter on the convict ship
sarett and cory and parker space-
masters all in charge of three of the
largest itl cruisers they had been con-
victed without trial on a charge of mu-
tiny-convicted by order of max bro-

deur president of the interplanetary
transport lines    mutiny sa-
retts lip curled bitterly that was a
joke-a damned rotten joke they had
learned too much about the uranian
slave traffic too much about those thou-
sands of docile yet powerful elgae be-
ing torn from their parent world to
slave and die in the mercutian radium
mines a racket operated by bro-
deur himself

  and theyd get brodeur he was a
big man in interplanetary affairs a
mythical figure of power none of them
had ever seen but theyd find him-
and burn him

  almost there cory grunted ges-
turing through the murk toward a high
gleaming wall directly ahead it tow-
ered almost thirty feet above them its
polished surface sloping inward at a
sharp angle a barrier that no convict
had surmounted since the pit had been
created in moments they stood be-
neath it looking back over the way they
had come

  they could see nothing-only the
eternal fog like a vaporous monster
writhing in its lair a mist that con-
cealed thousands of convict laborers
beings from every inhabited planet in
the system they were toiling beside
those seething pools seeking jovian
sulphur crystals more valuable than
gold since dr martin quigleys discov-
ery of their marvelous ability to rejuve-
nate human life

 alan glanced at cory he was
squinting intently into the gloom wait-
ing sarett frowned he hoped park-
er and tull would make it they
should be here soon-unless they had
failed and if they had failed-either
of them-it meant death for the rest
death in a sulphur caldron for only
with the four was escape possible

  cory spoke without turning his head
wonder what it is that tull plans to
spring you remember-he mentioned


dynamic science stories

it last sleep period something to keep
the jovians occupied

  sarett shrugged i dont know any
more than you do but its bound to
be something good for that uranian
knows things-like every other high-
born member of his race and hes in
this to win if anything tulls griev-
ance was greater than their own for
brodeurs emissaries had tried to cap-
ture him with some of the elgae and
because he had killed a dozen of his
would-be captors and had escaped
they had sent him here on a faked
charge

  abruptly cory gripped alans arm
and he held his breath there was a
faint slithering sound out there in the
murk if it were a jovian-but it
wasnt the huge frame of lief parker
bulked large before them bloody un-
sightly sliding slowly forward like a
swimmer struggling against a powerful
undercurrent he was alone

  a hoarse whisper reached them sa-
rett-cory-is that you

  yeah cory answered wheres
tuh

  parker didnt reply till he joined
them at the base of the wall hell be
cornin he said we had a little
trouble the sluurs mustve suspected
somethin cause two of em jumped us
theyre cookin now-but it means
well have to rush things tull is
plantin his little diversion and i came
ahead since he can travel a lot faster

  what is this plan of tulls sarett
demanded cory and ive been won-
dering

darker grinned with one side of

	his face his eye closing in an ha-
bitual squint oh its prettyl pret-
ty ysee back home on uranus tull
is a chemist-an a damn good one
since hes been here hes been workin
durin sleep periods usin some of the
dishes they feed us with-an hes final-

ly made an explosive out of the liquid
in the pool dont ask me how-but
hes done it an when i left he was
settin the charge itll blow the floor
all around there into bits an let hell
come boilin through an while they
feed aspirin to that headache well
blast off

  blow up the floor of the pit in-
credulously cory repeated the words
thatll be-hell-for the other men
around here

  it will be hell sarett exclaimed
his dark face hard and grim he could
imagine the shattered shell of obsidian
floating in a churning mass of boiling
sulphur-jovians and convicts alike
sinking into the scalding flood-could
almost hear the curses the screams
   then he spoke again his voice
brittle as the sound of breaking glass
its tough but were not doing it just
to escape were going to get brodcur
-if it takes the life of every damned
convict in this stinking hole whats
the difference-a year in this air fin-
ishes a man anyway a quick death
is more merciful

  cory nodded youre right he
said stonily

  there was a moments silence
broken only by the faint wailing of a
distant sluur then sarett spoke in
brusque businesslike tones do i have
it straight tull takes the bottom
since hes heaviest biggest and strong-
est you parker get on tulls shoul-
ders  and cory crawls up on you cory
braces himself against the wall-and he
catches me when tull throws me up i
reach the top and crawl out right
okay parker snapped an then
you get that supply boat-quick-an
drop it in here to pick us up

  yeah-and- corys words were
lost abruptly in a crackling roar that
reverberated thunderously through the
pit tulls explosion a dull red flash
then silence another instant-and the
mutineers of space



veil of murk before them was ripped
to shreds by a lurid flare which lashed
up and up endlessly into the sky like
a mighty arm of flame reaching into
space in its wake came a second deto-
nation father of the flare-an inde-
scribable b-r-oooommm like nothing the
three had ever heard the floor of the
pit rocked drunkenly and a wave of
vertigo swept over the crouching men

  it set off a volcano cory cried
his words a thin whisper in the tumult
-words left hanging in midair as a
cyclonic blast of sulphur-laden smoke
flung him and his companions bodily
against the wall the perilous rocking
of the floor continued in tempo with the
belching of the new-born volcano and
now a shower of glowing sparks began
to fall in a stinging hail

  alan sarett struggled painfully to his
feet his battered body numbed with
shock a few feet away cory and
parker crawled erect neither seriously
injured

  parkers mouth twisted in his one-
sided grin plenty to interest the jo-
vians he shouted above the noise
more than we figured on now if
tull- he stopped short

  yeah cory concluded if tull
pulled through and we could get out of
here in a hurry there wouldnt be much
chance of pursuit but its a miracle
if he escaped

  then miracles still happen alan
cried here he comes 

  outlined against a background of
crimson flame a massive figure strode
ponderously toward them almost as
tall as the jovians he looked like a
crudely drawn caricature of a man with
a paper-white skin powerful arms
dangling from a tremendous chest
swung pendulously at his sides phys-
ically he suggested the brute-but his
mighty cranium with its high jutting

forehead belied the testimony of his

body

  not good-this ruption he said
jerkily in a cavernous bass it break
plans we get out-quick this place
not last long

  instantly parker sprang to his side
yeah-so lets pyramid

  easily tull swung the comparatively
puny form of the six-foot-three terre-
strial to his shoulders as he straight-
ened a particularly violent upheaval al-
most hurled him from his perch but
tulls fingers about his ankles saved
him

  during a brief lull in the volcanic
disturbance the uranian rumbled
now you cory and the lanky
space-master joined parker on tulls
broad shoulders giant fingers closed
rigidly on parkers ankles while jon
cory stepped into the others cupped
hands-and in an instant he was teeter-
ing dizzily six feet below freedom
reaching out he steadied himself
against the sloping wall now he was
faced with the difficult task of turning
about in order to catch alan sarett
somehow he managed it and stood with
shoulders braced against the smooth
expanse

  hurry he snapped i cant hold
this forever

  alan sarett stood before the uranian
with set face his part in this little
gymnastic exhibition was the most dan-
gerous he looked upward through the
mist corys shoulders seemed peril-
ously small and he was rocking back
and forth alans teeth clenched as he
felt fingers of steel grasp his arms a
breathless upward rush-and corys
long arms wrapped themselves about
him in a desperate embrace an instant
they tottered on the brink of collapse
while jon cory strove mightily to
hold a weight that in jupiters grav-
ity was tremendous and all grips
held

  one more step cory grunted into

sarevts ear and youre ouu


dynamic science stories

a lan nodded jerkily carefully
mounting to corys shoulders di-
rectly above him was the lip of this
damned pit-almost within arms reach
-and he could reach it if he could
stand up cory gripped his ankles now
and he straightened he balanced him-
self pressing against the wall his
hands curved eagerly around the edge

  he could reach it but it was
smooth how could he expect to pull
himself out with so little to support
him the ghost of a doubt floated in
his mind-then parkers deep voice
came up to him make it boy re-
member- brodeur and with a
mighty surge of strength through mus-
cles that cracked with effort sarett
pulled himself up-and over-out of
the pit

  with legs spread wide he peered
about him he saw no one a half
mile away where the jovians entered
and left the pit there would be a hand-
ful of guards and a few itl men-
but they wouldnt molest him he
started toward the landing field

  thick underbrush-the pale yellow
fleshy growth that covered all of tem-
perate jupiter-blocked his path alan
moved through it with a slow sliding
shuffle and even that dragging pace
required tremendous effort for the
great gravity strove mightily to draw
him flat against the surface like a
needle on the tip of a magnet volubly
he cursed the entire planet it would
take an age to reach the supply ship at
this rate-and down there in the pit
cory and parker and tull might even
now be sinking into a pool of lava for
the intermittent roar of the eruption
had not abated in the slightest degree

  on he plodded heart pounding legs
aching under a strain that was almost
beyond endurance breathing was as
difficult here as in the sulphurous air
of the pit scoria and ashes from the
volcano formed a cloud that cloaked

everything with hot stinging dust but
sarett moved steadily onward his
shoulders hunched forward his hands
clenched hard at his sides

  the ship had landed little more than
a quarter mile away but the distance
seemed endless to alan yet he made
it almost exhausted he halted at last
at the edge of the rocket-blasted clear-
ing leaned against an outcropping
rock resting searching for a sign of
life he knew there were always men
stationed about the itl building on the
opposite edge of the field but he hoped
they would be inside he saw no one

  abruptly he sank to his knees and
hands and left the shelter of the leath-
ery underbrush in that position there
was less chance of his being seen slow-
ly he crept across the blackened clear-
ing toward the spherical supply ship

  he was less than twenty feet from
the craft when he heard a heavy hollow
rumble like the pounding of many giant
feet he straightened up glanced in
the direction of the pit-and saw a
horde of sluurs sweeping over the un-
dergrowth fleeing from the horrors of
the eruption their many-jointed legs
carried them over the ground with
amazing speed despite their vast bulk
they had almost reached the clearing
now they saw the terrestrial and a dis-
cordant chorus burst from their slits of
mouths

  dread swept over alan sarett if
they reached the space ship before he
did theyd stamp him into the ground
and the three in the pit-theyd burn
in a lake of lava the blood drained
from his face his lips drew taut over
clenched teeth

  quickly he rose    and with great-
er strength than he knew he possessed
with a sudden superhuman effort that
centered all his power in his whitely
corded legs he ran to the supply ship
leaped inside and slid shut the pon-
derous airlock then he sank into an
mutineers of space



exhausted sweating inert heap just in-
side the door

  moments later he staggered erect
there might be men of the itl within
this craft he listened there was no
sound save his own harsh breathing and
the muffled roar from the pit he
crossed the vacuum chamber to the in-
ner wall of the ship he closed the sec-
ond door behind him stealthily he slid
along the metal corridor to where he
knew the control room must be the
door was closed it slid slowly aside as
he pressed against it he peered
through the crack-then flung the door
wide there was no one in the room
the ship was probably deserted he
knew from experience that space-men
usually left their crafts for an hour or
two immediately after landing in order
to stretch their legs on solid ground

  eagerly alans fingers gripped a con-
trol lever his eyes glancing automatic-
ally over the familiar array of knobs
and dials and pointers as he pressed
a button that started an air purifier to
clearing the atmosphere of its sulphur
stench and closed a switch that set in
motion a gyro-gravitator imparting to
the craft an artificial gravity elation
surged through him at the feeling of
power that was his with the controls
of a space ship again in his hands

 i he lever moved down a single
a notch and into the rocket chambers
flowed vaporized fuel a second notch
and the craft trembled with the slow re-
lease of power a third and she rose
gently into the air sarett switched on
the bank of screens which curved before
him each of its five facets presenting a
different view of his surroundings be-
low him he saw the jovian horde scat-
tering wildly to escape the deluge of fire
from the rocket vents he saw another
sluur rushing from the itl building
carrying a terrestrial official in its ten-
tacles the latter waving frantic objec-

tions alan grinned and sent the ship
darting upward with another notch of
power-upward and northward where
the light of the pit crimsoned the smoky
yellow sky

  in an instant he was high above the
great abyss skillful manipulation of the
controls holding the sphere almost sta-
tionary in midair anxiety gripped him
at what he saw and he began sinking
rapidly the prison pit was a wide
wide hollow brimming with smoke and
flame liquid lava an angry lurid red
bubbled and surged and swept about
everywhere like whirlpools of hell
spouting coiling clouds of yellow-white
smoke here and there a darker spot
was silhouetted against the crimson an
island of solidity in a flaming sea-but
they were pitifully few a sudden
qualm of conscience stabbed him when
he thought that in part he was respon-
sible for this-but memory of max bro-
deur and of the tortures he had experi-
enced down there froze his face into
stern implacability

  heading toward a vaguely familiar
strip of land under the southern wall
he sank lower and lower and sud-
denly he saw a group of human figures
frantically waving among them the
giant tull

  with all his skill he lowered the ship
to a surface that bucked and swayed
like the liquid mass beneath it as he
switched off power he pulled back a
lever which opened both portals of the
airlock his eyes turned mechanically
toward the screens for a final glance
about and he gasped not only were
cory parker and tull pushing toward
the ship behind them came a score of
other convicts

  furiously sarett rushed from the
room those maddened creatures-
many of them the scum of the system-
if they took possession of the space hip
it would mean disaster  he reached the
entrance tull was already there


dynamic science stories

  the uranian stood with his back to
the airlock crouching like a boxer now
cory and parker joined him the on-
coming horde hesitated before the men-
acing three and came to a straggling
halt

  no pass tull rumbled ominously
ship too small you stay here

  a howl rose from terror-parched
throats and a burly brute with the
thick body and bestial face of a vene-
rian halfcaste roared a foul curse

  cmon yuh crimps he snarled
they cant stop us 

  at that instant a great slab of the
obsidian floor broke away with a sick-
ening lurch and vanished into the boil-
ing lava almost at their feet the mob
swept forward in a wild surge of animal
terror

  tull met them with a sweeping
crushing attack of his incredibly long
arms hurling the leaders backward
upon those behind them

  inside cory parker the giant
roared quick he sent them reel-
ing toward the supply ship and they
dragged themselves hastily into the air-
lock

  come on tull sarett shouted
weve got to go

  tull holding the convicts back like
the frothing beasts they resembled
roared over his shoulder

  you go me hold these go-get
brodeur

  even as the three terrestrials
shouted frantic protest a single athletic
figure darted suddenly from the mass
straining like a sprinter and leaped as
sarett had done into the airlock

  tull took a step after him then as
a triumphant howl rose from the mob
he swung furiously about parker
struck viciously at the intruder then
their bodies crashed together and they
clinched in a mighty struggle cory
and sarett seeing a churning wall of
redly glowing magma rolling toward

them hastened to the control room sec-
onds counted now

  for an endless moment everything
seemed to pause in stunned paralysis-
then with an awful roar the entire strip
of obsidian broke away from the wall
the space ship reeled sickeningly roll-
ing parker and his combatant back into
the corridor-and at that instant the
airlock clangcd shut and the craft
leaped toward the safety of the sky

  in the control room alan thought he
heard a chorus of screams blend into
one spine-chilling sound that swiftly
faded into silence god he said-
and it was not a curse

  cory spoke softly its tough to
leave tull like that sarett but itd be
a damn sight worse to let him kick in
for nothing

a lan sarett stood motionless at
the control bank of the supply-
ship minerva staring into the tele-
screens his eyes followed the green
disc of jupiter watching it shrink into
a blur of light till it joined the stars as
a point of radiance in the black mosaic
of space at last he faced the center
of the room

  lief parker grinning his one-sided
grin gestured toward a motionless fig-
ure on the floor then slowly caressed
his knuckles

  well he demanded whatll we do
with this egg smash his shell or put
im in cold storage he eyed a metal-
sqreened porthole thoughtfully hell
be-safe-out there

  cory shook his head why do any-
thing with him at least lets give him
a chance to talk hell-you cant
blame him for trying to blast out of that
damned pit wed ve done the same
thing

  sarett nodded youre right cory
the four of us were in the same tight
spot-and he took the only way out
if hes the right kind and plays a
mutineers of space



square game i say he should have his
chance

  parker grunted morosely major-
ity rules o course-though i still think
im right but since you insist lets
wake him up an let im broadcast

  minutes later the stranger opened his
eyes the three space-masters stood
over him motionless silent faces ex-
pressionless he arose slowly his keen
gaze shifting from one to the other he
surveyed them narrowly a hint of hos-
tility creeping into the set of his mouth
to be banished instantly then he
smiled a smile that went no deeper
than his lips and his voice as he spoke
bore a hint of arrogance

  i certainly appreciate your recep-
tion he said nice of you to pull me
out of that mess back there if you
had come a minute later i would be a
cinder he paused inspecting the
three with an air that bordered on in-
solence

  switch off the funny stuff parker
growled or youll be breathin some
damned thin air outside that porthole
cmon-lets have some dope about
yourself

  the other met parkers truculent
glare with a look of unperturbed calm
then shrugged very well he agreed
my name is jones-walter jones
second-class space pilot just out of
training school got caught doing a lit-
tle private smuggling-andvmax bro-
deur had me sent to the pit and who
are you

  sarett answered we were itl
space-masters each in command of a
cruiser he introduced himself cory
parker each of us working alone
discovered that max brodeur big boss
of the itl crusader against unfair ex-
ploitation of the systems weaker races
-that max brodeur the damned rack-
eteer is the power behind the uranian
slave traffic and the contraband work-
ing of the mercutian radium mines

he smiled grimly we made the mis-
take of trying to do something about it
-and we wound up in-hell 

  the others eyes widened brodeur
-behind that why that seems impos-
sible-

  but it isntl parker snapped and
now were out to get him an well
be gettin him see an hell pay
plenty 

  cory eyed jones quizzically you
said brodeur had you sent to the pit
maybe youd want to join us-

  no maybe about it jones ex-
claimed brodeur was responsible for
my spell in that sulphur-hole-and id
like nothing better than to see him get
what he deserves if i may join you
i think i can be of some help for i
know venus i received my pilot train-
ing in the school in terra city where
brodeur has his headquarters

  after a few minutes further discus-
sion walter jones became the fourth
member of the little party big lief
parker distrustful to the last made one
final statement

  get this jones an get it good if
we catch you in anythin shady-itll be
the last thing youll ever do-any-
where  

  jones smiled thinly you wont
catch me in anything shady parker of
that you may be certain

  an hour later minus the grime and
gore of their fight in the pit and clad
in itl uniforms found in the ships sup-
plies sarett cory and parker leaned
over the space-chart studying their po-
sition in the heavens jones was at the
controls a few feet away

  doesnt look promising does it
cory remarked

  parker scowled and pointed toward
the space chart promising theres
jupiter - about four hundred and
eighty million miles from the sun and
over heres venus sixty-seven million
miles from the other side of the sun


dynamic science stories

that means we have to cover close to
five hundred an fifty million miles of
space an theres not enough fuel in
this little tank to take us a quarter the
distance

  and we cant stop at any supply
base for more fuel cory added

darker grunted disdainfully an
even if we had enough fuel it would
take a crazy amount of time to make it
at the rate were goin theres only one
thing to do-well have to get a bigger
faster boat

  and i can tell you how we can do
it sarett said slowly he paused
thoughtfully while cory and parker
waited jones looked up from the con-
trols

  its simple alan continued and
its feasible too look his finger
traced a line across the space chart
heres the course of the mars-gany-
mede passenger-cruiser vulcan i used
to have that run-i know her sched-
ule his finger paused in its move-
ment shes due to pass this point in
another six hours were just about
here-and we can easily be there before
them right in their course once there
we set off an automatic radio sos
theyll have to stop and investigate-
interplanetary law and when they do
well take over the ship

  parker laughed derisively yeah-
wed threaten to chastise em severely
if they didnt surrender were so well
equipped to make em behave-armed
to the gills an all that

  i mean it sarett insisted we
can take the ship-and it shouldnt be
very difficult when they make a trans-
fer from one boat to another-itl
boats that is-they swing toward each
other till their airlocks touch and the
openings are sealed together with the
rubber collars that rim the locks isnt
that right they nodded and after
the transfer is made both locks are

sealed the connection is broken and
the deserted ship is pulled along on a
trailer cable right

  sure cory grunted thats ele-
mentary so what

  simply this first we get as close
as possible to the vulcans orbit then
we get into space suits check them for
leaks and stop the air purifiers after
that we tap out about a quart of rocket
fuel from the tanks mix it with a little
martian garra ph and set it afire i
neednt tell you whatll happen to any-
one breathing the fumes one whiff will
paralyze them for an hour or two   
well when everythings set we start
the sos signal then when they pick
us up and our airlock opens and their
airkck opens-tell me will it work
parker began pacing the floor ex-
citedly damned if it doesnt look
feasible he exclaimed crew pas-
sengers everybody knocked out wed
only have to tie em up an carry em
into this tub we could set em adrift
or drag em after us droppin em some
place where theyd be picked up or
even better we could stow em down
below somewhere cause they cant
breathe hydro-garra fumes too long an
live he stopped short yeah-but
what if the vulcan doesnt stop
sarett shrugged then wed be ex-
actly where we are now but they will
stop space law demands it

  the cool voice of jones came to them
from the controls why all the objec-
tions the plan has a chance of suc-
ceeding-i dont think any of us have
a better suggestion-so lets go

  and so it was decided after com-
puting the probable position of the vul-
can with the utmost care they sent the
little supply ship roaring through space
at top speed cory was at the con-
trols several hours would elapse be-
fore they reached the passenger lane
while they waited parker prepared a
hurried meal jones broke out the space
mutineers of space



suits and sarett made ready the mix-
ture of rocket fuel and garra oil after
they had eaten they ranged themselves
before the tele-screens    waiting

  on and on the little craft sped an
hour passed-another-and suddenly
cory exclaimed

  almost there

  with forward rocket vents he
thecked their pace and carefully jock-
eyed the minerva into position be-
hind him the others got busy in less
than ten minutes the stage was set all
four were clad in the clumsy balloon-
like suits used for exposure in airless
space a dome of glass forming their
head-gear individual radio transmit-
ters and receivers in each suit made
communication possible the purifiers
had been checked and from a small-
mouthed vessel in the middle of the con-
trol room rose barely visible clouds of
lethal vapor the televisor was send-
ing an automatic sos into the void

  anxiously the four watched the
screens waiting for the sensitive instru-
ment to pick up sight of the passenger
cruiser and it came-a speck of mov-
ing light against the silver-splashed
backdrop of space

   instantly sarett sprang to the tele-
visor plugging a wire into his speaker
he connected it with the instrument
switched off the automatic distress sig-
nal and sent his own voice through the
ether

  first lieutenant freeman of supply
ship minerva were out of fuel weve
drifted far off our course our air puri-
fiers are out of order and our supply
of oxygen is exhausted can you take
us aboard he waited-and a reply
came

  pilot turner of the vulcan we
hear you minerva by order of space-
master stuart we are swinging along-
side be ready to transfer

  check vulcan we are ready
alan broke contact switched off the

televisor and turned to the others

   take it fast he snapped grimly
speed is what well need

tensely they watched the ap-
proaching cruiser her sunward side
gleaming like the head of a comet roc-
ket blasts shot alternately from for-
ward rear and lateral vents as the pilot
eased the vulcan closer to the smaller
craft in moments both spheres were
flashing along at equal velocity side by
side

   cory flung over the lever that opened
the inner door of the airlock it filled
rapidly with the almost invisible vapor
voiceless the four crouched in the door-
way there was a brittle tension in the
air as though something tremendous
were gathering its forces to shatter it-
self

   now they heard the clash ef metal
against metal as giant cables flung out
huge magnetized hooks which seized
metal rings set in the minervas sur-
face there were other scraping sounds
the clamping of airlock to airlock then
silence and in another instant a sharp
tapping on the metal door at saretts
nod parker thrust back a lever-and
they were gazing along a wide passage-
way into the vulcan

   nine men crouched there three of
them officers the other six men of the
crew and each gripped a grimly point-
ing rocket pistol

   for half a breath the four mutineers
stood as though stunned their escape
had been reported sarett thought
swiftly-then too much happened too
quickly for thought the space-master
gesturing with his pistol his lips mov-
ing in curt unheard words a hand leap-
ing to his throat in sudden surprise and
annoyance his knees buckling even
as he sagged floorward alan saw his
eyes strike the glass encased face of
jones saw those eyes widen with in-
credulous recognition-then he sank


dynamic science stories

limply on his face

  seconds it took and others were
falling too startled to remember their
weapons the four charged swiftly to-
ward the crumbling mass one of the
crew still alert whipped back a lever
with lightning speed-the door shot
shut-but cory was quicker his long
body darting ahead leaped fully into
the opening i and the ponderous metal
disc crashed against him

  there was a horrible crunching
sound a raglike sagging of corys body
-then a strange cessation of all mo-
tion a stunned instant-and sarett
led the others in a leap toward the door
they flung their weight against it
thrusting it along its grooved track its
catch clicking into place cory slumped
forward and sarett caught him gently
he lowered him to the floor ignoring
everything else

  cory-is it-are you badly hurt
he shook him gently his face grim his
words only audible to himself cory
-did-did they get you

  wearily the others eyes opened he
smiled faintly struggling to speak
then sarett saw his lips form the
words

  get brodeurl and he died

  white with fury a dull ache in his
chest alan sarett leaped erect and
glared about the floor was strewn
with unconscious space-men parker
and jones were not in sight warily
he moved along the hallway stepping
over the still bodies he entered the
main corridor here a man lay his feet
twisted awkwardly beneath him there
another-then a woman he passed
them with only a casual glance his eyes
searching for his two companions then
he saw them approaching rapidly

  when they were close enough parker
spoke his half-grin expressing great
satisfaction theyre all under-
couldnt find a single one conscious
then he saw saretts solemn face and

his own sobered is it bad

  corys dead saretts nostrils di-
lated and his eyes narrowed by damn
-brodeur will pay-for him and
tull

  solemnly parker nodded we cant
help cory-but we wont let im down
two of us now-but well show that
crimp that twos plenty

  three you mean jones said
dont forget me were all out to get
brodeur you know

  sarett and parker snapped hard sus-
picious glances at the other there
seemed to be a sneer in his voice but
he met their scrutiny with a stare of
bland innocence

  dont you think wed better get
those sleepers down below in the hold
he asked id like to get out of this
suit and weve got to clear the air first
yeah sarett growled parker only
nodded there were bitter words on
his tongue eager for expression but he
swallowed them

  in grim silence they set to work
morosely alan sarett and lief park-
er stared into the vulcans tele-screens
on all facets save one was the blackness
of space the hard twinkle of distant
suns and the softer gleam of scattered
planets-in all but one and in that lay
the blinding solar disc rimmed by its
awesome corona a spectacular sight
sharp against the blackness not far
away floated mercury like a polished
copper coin tiny world of unbearable
heat and wealth beyond reckoning

dut the two space-masters barely
saw either body their thoughts
were of other things

  the more i see of this jones park-
er was saying the less i want to see
of him

  sarett frowned i know he seems
to be carrying a crooked cargo yet we
cant condemn a man just because we
dont like him
mutineers of space



  the hell we cant  parker grunted
lean he paused ever since we
put him in charge of the prisoners down
below hes been walkin around with
that damned smirk on his loud speaker
-an i dont like it ive watched him
an everythin seems okay but i dont
believe it is his lips set in sudden
determination hell-why talk about
it im goin to lay him out where he
cant do any damage

  youll do what mr parker
parker and sarett whirled at a suave
voice behind them stared into the
steady muzzles of two rocket pistols
in the doorway stood the man who
called himself walter jones still smil-
ing his shallow smile a single curse
escaped parker then he was silent

  the little farce is over gentlemen
jones said amiably youve served
your purpose quite well and your free-
dom is now at an end ive decided
against killing you however-unless
you compel me to do so he half
turned though his eyes and pistols did
not waver

  come in boys

  in from the corridor strode two men
in the garb of officers-spacemaster
stuart and one of his lieutenants each
held a weapon in one hand and a coil
of rope in the other

  meet two of my assistants jones
said both are men of integrity and
discretion not to mention-

  hell parker roared through his
teeth his throat corded with rage cut
the comedy if you want to say some-
thin spill it if you dont shut up
an do somethin

  sarett remained silent his narrowed
eyes watching every move of the three
before him

  the smile froze on jones face very
well he said slowly would it in-
terest you to know that i am max bro-
deur

  brodeur  as one sarett and park-

er gasped the name alans thoughts
reeled brodeur-here and these
two space-men were his aides

  yes brodeur all suavity was
gone from his voice now it sounded a
harsh monotone through the control
room max brodeur in that hell-pit--
because of your talking yes your
meddling caused an investigation-and
they condemned me to the pit for life
i should kill you-but i have a better
idea you were so kind as to bring us
this close to mercury-and thats where
youll spend the next six or eight months
-if you live that long i slaves in the
radium mines perhaps youve heard
how those mines affect the workers-
radium bums-terrible sores-blind-
ness-insanity    im sure it will
be far more satisfactory than merely
killing you

  tie them up boys

  as the space-men approached sa-
retts thoughts raced wildly to hurl
himself at those ready pistols would be
suicide but to let them fie him would
be just as certain if slower death
there was one chance-a desperate
one-

  he head brodeurs voice turn
around with your hands behind you

  as he turned a space-man grasped
his wrists he felt the rope circle them
-and he leaped toward the controls he
knew so well

  his body struck the master switch
wrenching it open a rocket blast
roared past him knifing into the control
panel-and utter darkness fell upon the
cruiser the room roared into a bed-
lam with alarmed cries the space-
men fell back toward brodeur and a
hail of fire poured over the spot where
sarett and parker had been standing
but neither was there with the dark-
ness they had dropped were rolling to-
ward their three assailants

  the light of the pistols might have
revealed their position but everything

happened too rapidly one moment
they were standing passively the next
in darkness they were rolling across the
floor the third they had seized the
three and had hurled them from their
feet brodeur crashed upon sarett
parker had tackled the other two

  flaming rocket pistols whirled and
clattered into blackness-and it was
man to man in the dark

  with wild fierce exultation sarett
flung his hands upward about the body
seeking a throat the words flamed
through his brain-get brodeur i they
were on their feet-reeled apart to close
again instantly the shock of their
meeting was like the clap of hands

  get brodeur alans lips curled
wolfishly this was the man who had
ordered him to that jovian hell this
the uranian slaver this the man re-
sponsible for the death of cory of tull
crimson battle-flame flared within him
tempered with a cold cold fury one
hand ground into a thick shoulder the
other lashed heavily against a lean jaw

   rowling a curse brodeur
grasped alans throat with both
hands and as sarett wrenched free he
felt a foot land heavily against his shin
pain burned fiery hot through the out-
raged bone and he wrapped his arms
about brodeur in red rage a short arm
jab glanced from his chin and he rocked
back on his heels-then lunged forward
again into a clinch their legs coiled
about each other and they dropped to
the floor over and over they rolled
striking blow after blow gouging kick-
ing like two beasts all reason gone from
their struggle

  suddenly they were on their feet
again striking blows through the dark-
ness brodeur stumbled-and alan
caught him in a deadly grip that came
unsought one arm gripped him vise-
like beneath the shoulders the other
hand thrust upward against his chin

alans fingers ground his lips against his
teeth and the leverage forced his head
steadily backward dimly he heard
brodeur suck in a tortured breath and
an awful scream tore through the dark-
ness he eased the pressure for an in-
stant-then he remembered cory gasp-
ing out his life-and his muscles tight-
ened grimly

  brodeur wrapped his legs about
alans body in a last desperate grip
fear of death pouring strength into his
thighs as the pressure grew straining
about him painfully sarett suddenly
flung himself face downward upon the
floor his full weight striking the head
and bent neck of max brodeur there
was a dull nauseating snap and he lay
still

  slowly alan rose panting hoarsely
reaction trembling in his limbs he
listened for sounds of lief parker and
his two combatants heard

  cmon-cmon cant a guy get a
decent fight in this corner o space
two of you-an you break like eggs

   hey alan how you doin

  its-over alan answered lets
have a light he groped toward the
control panel fumbled till he found the
master switch closed it-

  light flickered on in the chamber
uncertain light that wavered with the
vibration of loose connections it re-
vealed three men lying awkwardly on
the rocket blasted floor one would
never move again life still clung to
the other two  it revealed a con-
trol panel hopelessly etched and burned
by a barrage of rocket blasts miracu-
lously two facets of the tele-screen had
survived the holocaust in one flamed
an image of the sun and it was spread-
ing out filling the screen-leaping up
at them with frightful speed

  they were falling into the sun

  instantly sarett leaped to the con-
trols flung on checking rocket blasts-
but there was no response he tried
mutineers of space



again-futilely he shrugged no sense
in attempting to repair this ruin before
him he looked at parker in silence

  lief parkers lips twisted in his one-
sided grin his eye half closing looks
bad eh well-well be goin the way
tull an cory went-an were takin
that crimp with us he gestured to-
ward the floor im satisfied

  sarett scowled but those passen-
gers and space-men down below- he
stopped short a slow smile appearing
on his face say-we must be slip-
ping the minerva whats to pre-
vent our clearing her atmosphere re-
fueling her from the vulcans tank and
blasting in under her power itll take
a good while for us to fall forty-odd
million miles-well have plenty of time
to make the change

  parkers grin spread itself to the
other side of his mouth so thats
what brains are for he exclaimed

  well land on the moon alan con-
tinued and radio the itl headquar-
ters gn earth about the vulcan and
after that-well well be outlawed i
suppose-

  parker interrupted excitedly say-
i know what well do after that well
grab us one of those new interstellar
ships from the shops on the moon an
well roam the sky as we damn please
well-hell well see an do plenty is
it a go

  alan sarett looked at the other panel
of the tele-screen which had escaped the
barrage of pistol fire there were a
million worlds out there gleaming like
eyes glaring at him with a cold chal-
lenging light worlds-with adventures
enough for a million lifetimes a
warmth appeared on his face reflecting
an inner glow his hand shot out and
gripped parkers-hard

  its a go he said

ratic vibration ozone crackled in the
thin air and a silent wave of power
winged its way with the swiftness of
light toward the pale green planet glow-
ing in the darkness of the void   

  missing half your life thats all
there is to it declared the cheerful
young man nothing like a little home
of your own with a plot of ground
bring your friend out to dinner says
my wife well show him what real home
life is great girl my wife youll like
her you say youve never been out to
this section before

  never answered the other with
distaste he noted the tidy monotony of
the small suburban community uni-
form stucco cottages a thousand homes
with a thousand similar tiny grass plots
a thousand cheery lights burning in a
thousand windows for a thousand hus-
bands to come home to his nostrils
twitched with the crisping odor of a
thousand chops frying on a thousand
little genius gas ranges   

  yes sir nothing like it boasted his
host again marry and settle down is
what i always say youll see for your-
self in a minute my house is just
around the corner and past-

  -the gas station finished the vis-
itor

  what whats that the proud
young husband stared at his guest
amazedly hey i thought youd never
been here before

  why i-i havent stammered
the visitor weakly i dont know what
made me say that ive never been to
highland corners before but all of a
sudden somehow i felt as though id
seen this section a long long time
ago  

in the telescope chamber of the flag-

	staff observatory sir humphrey
wimpole ra shook his head as he
argued with his american friend and

colleague

  no wallace he said didactically
im afraid we must discard your fanci-
ful theory of life on other planets if
youll forgive my saying so it smacks
too much of the romantic like those
incredible yarns one reads in the sci-
ence-fiction magazines why the at-
mospheric conditions the lack of
warmth and light the shortage of oxy-
gen-

  but sir humphrey insisted pro-
fessor wallace you must remember
this all life need not be exactly in the
same form as ours different bodies
adapted to strange environments a
different form of reasoning perhaps-
tut tut shrugged the british
scientist impatiently all reasoning is
based on the same fundamentals you
know as well as i do that the milan ob-
servatory has been attempting to com-
municate with other planets for more
than thiry years

  twenty-four hours a day they
broadcast a series of signals based on
pure mathematics-the science which
all logical creatures must recognize
the law of the squares two followed
by a four three followed by a nine
then a four-with a pause

  surely if there were intelligent crea-
tures say on mars they would under-
stand the fundamental principle of this
squaring factor-and send us a logical
solution 

  he stopped abruptly and passed a be-
wildered hand over his broad face the
american leaped up

 sir humphrey whats wrong
shall i get water

  no-nothing thanks faltered the
visiting astronomer its nothing at
all just a peculiar sensation such as
we all experience occasionally for an
instant i felt that i had been through
this same scene once  oh a long time
ago and this is my first visit to amer-
ica odd isnt it
the message from the void



  the magazine editors look of amuse-
ment faded gave way to a disturbed
frown he stared angrily at the manu-
script in his hand and pressed the buz-
zer on his desk

  miss jenkins he ordered send
murphy in here

  murphy entered the broad grin on
his face fading as he glimpsed the edi-
tors expression

  murphy growled the editor what
in blazes is the idea of sending this story
up here to me for reading

  why-why its goodl stammered
the first reader as a matter of fact
its the best story i ever found in the
unrush mail and from an unknown
too it shows a world of promise 
good snorted the editor of
course its good it ought to be its
the rankest kind of plagiarism a di-
rect steal from    from    well i
dont exactly remember where i read it
before but i did i remember read-
ing this story a long time ago  

  the reciting student swayed sud-
denly raised a hand to his forehead
and shook his head when he lowered
it again the color had left his face he
stared at the professor with vaguely
frightened eyes

  herr toggman- he whispered
yes wilson the psychologist
glanced at the boy curiously

  im sorry said the student but
ive quite forgotten what question you
asked me i just had the most confused
feeling i felt as though i were sud-
denly repeating something id done a
long long time ago yet this is the
first time we met in this classroom

be on the lookout for the next big issue
   read the best science fiction
written with an eye to the future-
on sale january     this is a red
circle magazine

  he professor smiled gently

     a very common sensation wil-
son we will discuss it at greater length
later in this course it happens to all
men at some time or other every psy-
chologist recognizes it and has some
theory to explain it henri bergson
calls it the memory of the present

  humans walking down strange
streets talking with new acquaintances
often stop short-believing they have
done the same thing some time before
some people claim the sensation has
some significance but that is palpably
absurd it is an utterly meaningless-

  in a control room more than -

	miles distant dor jan removed the
amplifying unit from his head there
was defeat in his large many-faceted
eyes as he gestured to his assistant
once more a button was pressed the
crackling hum ceased the generator
whirred and died the light of the pal-
lid globe flickered wearily

  success master the robots as-
sistants thought came to the martian
astronomers mind anxiously dor jan
grimaced

  no failure again i fear i must
report to the academy that the green
planet definitely does not sustain life

	am certain that our signals reached
there still in more than  rennai of
experiment we have received no answer-
ing signals from its cloudy obscurity

  but surely    surely   sighed
the scientist if there were intelligent

exciting long novelette

by robert moore williams

 to silent 

 dick markle dropped his pipe
 there it is again he whispered

   lean leathery-faced dr burstone
 nodded his iron-gray head

   bright flecks of light gleamed again
 in his dull knowledge-weary eyes
 eager lights they were as if the spirit
 of youth still burned in that old body

 t isten 

         out of the fastness of the
-- night-steeped jungle from no-
where and from everywhere from the
star-studded sky overhead and the
foetid earth beneath came a thin
sibilant crackling sound like the part-
ing of a taut violin string swiftly it ran
around the rim of the world like a sharp
sword slicing the night in twain then
it withdrew into the unknown void that
gave it birth the jungle was silent

as he stumbled backward markle saw
the old ethnologist reach up and grasp

the switches
those two americans were condemned to the wrath of incredible scientific
devices by the great mayan fire gods-for they had brashly violated the
sanctity of that beautiful girl in the zipantoric ball of flame

  i heard it he answered softly if
you turn around youll see it

  dick whirled they were standing on
top of the pyramid of the sun which
formed a part of a far-flung colony of
the ancient mayas that they had dis-
covered hidden and long deserted in the

jungle of northern south america

  they were no longer alone on the
flat-topped structure an upright oval
of golden fire as tall as a man was glow-
ing on the western edge of the parapet
it was not flame in the meaning of the
word when it is associated with com-


dynamic science stories

bustion there was no suggestion of heat
the glow was not feeding on anything
it looked like a huge football standing
on end and was about the same color
it apparently was electrical in nature
and slightly resembled ball lightning
except that no lightning ball ever known
to man was a hundredth part as large
as this

pick heard burstone catch his
breath out of the corner of his
eyes he saw that the old ethnologist was
trembling yet dick knew it was not
from fear the scientist did not know
the meaning of that word

  what is it he whispered

  i dont know lad burstone an-
swered dont move  something is
going to happen

  the golden bubble of flame glowed
more vividly its flame came from
innumerable coruscating points that
were visible yet did not illuminate the
soft tropic darkness it glowed like yel-
low witch-fire like golden phosphores-
cence

  as they watched the pin-points of
light swirled glimmered raced in weird
circles coalesced took on a vague out-
line it looked like a television receiver
that was out of phase with the trans-
mitter racing across the reception
screen was an incoherent ramification of
swirling white dots

  the lambent dots of light moved into
phase and almost disappeared leaving
only a thin bubble of golden light

  within that bubble of flame was a
girl

  the golden light played over her
lithe body shimmered from the metal
ornaments that covered her breasts
flickered and danced from a light skirt
that fell half-way to her knees
coalesced in the circle of metal that
crossed her forehead met in an arch at
the top of her small head played lov-
ingly through the midnight hair that

cascaded over her shoulders in her
right hand she held a slender rod mar-
kle gasped that rod was ornamented
with the design of the feathered
serpent potent symbol among the pre-
historic mayans

  dick started to move forward but he
felt burstones hand tighten on his
arm

  easy markle the old scientist
whispered suppressed eagerness vibrat-
ing ill his voice she is carrying the
scepter of the feathered serpent i
think she is probably a priestess of zi-
pantoric

  but what is it a mirage the
younger man questioned

  i dont think so i think that girl
is alive somewhere

  how can she be alive the mayans
mysteriously disappeared centuries
ago

  perhaps somewhere in this wilder-
ness a colony survived and expanded
their science to dizzy heights outstrip-
ping with their earlier start the
younger science of the aryan races
burstones voice was alive with eager-
ness

  maybe he continued we are see-
ing the transmission of images to any
desired spot without the necessity of
cumbersome receiving apparatus it
sounds impossible but who knows that
it is impossible anything may be true
watch  

  imperiously the girl in the golden
bubble raised the rod she had the
haughty regal bearing of a queen who
was accustomed to commanding and
having her commands obeyed

  if it was a mirage a television pro-
jection it was a remarkably realistic
one dick could see the tiny ear-rings
she wore in the lobes of her golden pink
ears he could see the deep black of
her eyes and the haughty look that was
within them

  she raised the scepter brought down
quest of zipantoric



the tip so that it pointed at them she
could see them she knew they were
there

  dick felt that the finger of fate was
pointing at them he had the feeling
when her scepter pointed at him that
he was being selected for some un-
guessed sacrifice to some unknown but
potent deity it had the appearance of
a ritual the selection of a victim

  the haughty look within her eyes
confirmed this feeling

  he shook of burstones arm stepped
forward his lithe six feet overshadow-
ing the girl

  when he moved she seemed to be-
come aware of his existence as an in-
dividual the haughty look in her eyes
faded she looked at him as a girl may
look at a man and in her eyes was sud-
denly startled concern

  dicks face was oddly pinched as he
gazed at her in his mind was turmoil
which coalesced in a nervous tension
that was transmitted to his muscles he
did not will to act he did not know
where his muscles got their orders

ignoring burstones warning shout

	he leaped into that bubble of golden
fire a wave of sick agony shot through
his body the bubble collapsed he held
in his arms a writhing struggling girl

  she was real he could feel her
what he had thought was a mirage was
reality the girl was alive here

  burstones flashlight cut a cone of
radiance through the night the girl
cowered away from it she was afraid
of that flashlight

  release her lad burstone whis-
pered

  dick let his arms drop she slipped
out of his grasp drew herself erect
stood proud and haughty before them
only tiny muscular tremors showing
that she was frightened she flinched
but she faced the flashlight its rays
poured over her golden brown body

   she spoke markle standing beside
her saw her lips move and knew that
he heard the words at that moment it
did not occur to him to think it strange
that he knew what the words meant

  who dares to profane zantha by
touching her sacred body

  m a y a n  ejaculated burstone
she is speaking mayan i recognize
elements of it

  but the meaning of her words
markle interrupted i know what her
words mean-in english when she
speaks i see mental pictures    and

i	know what she is saying   

   he turned to the girl how  
you have the answer she replied
i make you see pictures in your mind
and you know what i am saying 

  mental telepathy  burstone
gasped brought to perfection
can you understand us he asked
the girl

  certainly you and your comrade
have strong minds and i can easily
grasp your thought impulses

  tio are you burstone con-
tinued

  i am zantha which means high
priestess to    she stopped a glint
of fear coming into her eyes burstone
and markle got a chaotic mental image
of fright

  listen she breathed do you
hear them

  dimly vaguely lost in the tropic
night came a sobbing rhythmic rumble
it was flung upward to the hot stars
that throbbed through the hot darkness
and flung by them back to earth the
two men listened like the beat of a
gigantic heart it pounded into their
minds rousing impulses buried deep
under the culture of centuries each
vaguely remembered things he had
known in some long time as he listened
to that sobbing murmur coming from
afar through the jungle night thin
ghosts rose to stalk through their minds


dynamic science stories

specter wraiths from the long ago when
the impossible happened on earth and
men believed it

  drums said markle softly

  no other word was spoken out of
burstones and markles minds over
nerve paths anciently rutted a tense-
ness crept to the muscles deep within
their bodies chemical changes took
place that they did not know about
each tendon sent in an order for an
extra supply of blood each nerve cell
gave the command to clear the decks
for action

  markle bent to the stone ledge
picked up a heavy hunting rifle he had
laid there when they climbed the
pyramid

  burstone saw the movement but said
nothing

  and now a new note came into the
sobbing of the drums

  at first it had been questioning com-
plaining now it was compelling and
it threatened definitely it threatened
all living things that moved upon the
earth were included in the magnificent
sweep of its threat subtly yet in-
cisively it voiced a warning

  theyve changed said dick
markle

  i hear it doctor burstone an-
swered

  somewhere off to the west where the
andes pushed up toward heaven the
drums were throbbing frenziedly and
now nearer at hand another drum took
up the beat

  thum thum thum    thum thum
thum  no written word will convey
the meaning of the drums

  zantha knew what they meant there
was no trace of fear on her features
when she spoke her chin was up
haughtily proudly she faced the west
somewhere somehow she had learned
how to die

  the wardens are coming for us
she said

ii

ho are the wardens
dick questioned why
are they coming for us
what will they do

  those whose duty it is to guard zi-
pantoric they are coming they come
for you because i named you to be of-
fered on the altar they come for me
because you have touched me have pro-
faned me no one may touch the high
priestess 

  zipantoric burstone whistled
the fire god of the mayans some-
where near here his tomb must stil
exist his worship preserved by this lost
colony what a find our names will
go down in history the old ethnolo-
gist was wildly excited

  what will they do to you dick
asked his mind reverting to zantha

  i shall see zipantoric she an-
swered her voice a hard whisper in the
night

  those who see zipantoric never
wish to see anyone else burstone in-
terpolated she means she will be
sacrificed

  not while i have a cartridge for this
rifle markle grimly interrupted

  your little weapon will not stop the
wardens she disdainfully replied
markle could not grasp the meaning of
the thought image that she used

  i pity any warden that gets in my
sights he answered meanwhile lets
start getting out of this country while
we can another drum is talking out
there now if we can make the river
well have a chance

  as they scrambled down the pyramid
their way lighted by burstones multi-
celled flashlight they heard still an-
other drum start its frenzied pounding

  they moved rapidly the drums
drove them to haste deep within their
minds long untouched nerve centers
quest of zipantoric



knew what the drums were hunting for
they are old as old as the race and
fear is older

  off beyond the rim of the world an-
other drum was booming the dull
throbbing stalked like beasts of prey
through the jungle darkness like the
great carnivora they were hunting in
the night hunting for something

  burstone moving rapidly in advance
of zantha and markle marveled at the
effect that throbbing note had on a civil-
ized mind wise was he in the history
of the race to ethnology he had de-
voted the study of a life time the rum-
ble of primitive drums awakened some-
thing in him that he scarcely knew
existed

  their camp was but a few hundred
yards distant when they reached it
they found it deserted the native
workers they had employed to help
them in excavating the ruins of this lost
city had fled into the jungle night

  the savage fears the darkness more
than any other thing his imagination
peoples it with hobgoblins evil spirits
he knows from bitter experience that
the beasts of prey are there and he is
afraid burstone knew this and he
marveled at the magnitude of the fear
that sent natives to hiding in the place
they feared most

  one native alone remained pedro
their guide and interpreter was sulking
in the main tent searching for some-
thing to steal before he left markle
collared him

  where are the men pedro

  they fraid and run off   

  the devil its lucky you didnt
get away you can guide us to the river
pedro you savvy the drums what
say

  pedro squirmed glanced nervously
at the dark forest

  no can tell

  cleanse the filth out of your ears
and listen again what say

  they talk of zipantoric master
they say  he comes 

  how does he    hey stop

  but the guide had slipped around
the corner of the tent they saw him
once in the light from the still glowing
fires a bronze shadow against the dark
green of the environing forest verdure
he slipped past the bole of a gigantic
tree and the jungle night swallowed
him

  pah he is afraid the ignorant
children of the forest are always full
of fear zantha spoke she had re-
mained in the background and pedro
had not seen her

jvtarkle turned to her zantha
he spoke slowly perhaps you
can tell us how we can evade these
wardens if we can get out of this
section we will be safe far to the
northward there is a great country
where we can find refuge there we
can gather many men and return and
sweep this wilderness but how can we
escape now

  no one has ever escaped the war-
dens no one ever will they follow
the trail like hunting dogs until their
quarry is captured we cannot evade
them    are    are you full of
fear like a child of the forest

  i am not afraid  for myself if
you can read my mind you know why
i am afraid

  she placed one hand shyly on his
arm yes  i know    we
will try but i do not think we will suc-
ceed we must go toward the rising
sun as rapidly as we can it may be
that they will not be able to follow
swiftly in the darkness

  burstone went into their tent came
out with a small medicine kit a knap-
sack of food a rifle extra ammunition

  get another light extra batteries a
light pack of food he said to his young
assistant    lets get out of here


dynamic science stories

while we have the opportunity the na-
tives in all probability have a sound ba-
sis for the fear they have shown i
think zantha knows what she is talking
about too but well come back if we
have to bring the marines  

  there was a grimness in the tone of
the old ethnologist he meant what he
said he had seen enough to know that
fame awaited him here in this wilder-
ness but fame amounted to little in
comparison with the keen scientific cu-
riosity which zantha had aroused he
knew that she belonged to the divergent
dominant group that had ruled the
mayans in ancient times from the
skeletons found in the burial places eth-
nologists knew that the mayans were
dark-skinned round-headed short and
sturdy but rare evidence indicated that
another people a taller people had
ruled them and this ruling class had
puzzled ethnologists for years   
unquestionably zantha belonged to
that class she would have at her fin-
ger tips the culture of the lost people
could explain their dispersion per-
haps she could explain that golden bub-
ble in which she had been transported
from that lost city of the west to the
peak of the pyramid of the sun

  she was waiting beside him while
markle rummaged in the tent he
spoke to her

  zantha how did you reach the top
of the pyramid where we found you
what was the appearance of fire that
surrounded you

  the knowledge of its operation is
not mine i was sent out from the tomb
in accordance with the ritual to desig-
nate who shall see his face the great
one i enter a small chamber there
and move as i will to move when your
son leaped into the bubble the force
was broken i do not know how it op-
erates it had always been there since
the great one came from the sky   

  my son burstone was puzzled

  the young man whom you call now
deeck and now mar-kel is he not
your son

  no burstone answered i wish
he was but i have no son

  he obeys you

  yes he is my assistant we have
been studying the mayan ruins here
i do not understand if he is not
your son is he your slave

  he is neither in our civilization
there are no slaves except economic
ones here he is now ready to go
later zantha i will explain to you if
there is a later he added turning an
ear to the sky where the thum-thum-
thum-thum of the drums reverberated

toward the east they went bur-
a stone leading the way and markle
bringing up the rear there was only a
vestige of a trail which they had cleared
when they entered this section the
fast growing vegetation had already re-
claimed it in places thorns snatched
at them creeping briars tore at their
clothes low limbs obstructed their way
dick bringing up the rear knew those
briars must be tearing zanthas bare
legs but he never heard a whimper out
of her

  a mile two miles they fought their
way forward the beat of the drums
kept pace with them urged them to
greater haste

  they topped a small hill bur-
stones light caught an object on the
ground a man lay there

  pedro said burstone tersely bend-
ing over the prone figure

  zantha and markle came up mar-
kle held a light while burstone lifted
the head of the native in his arms a
narrow livid burn was seered across his
face cut to the bone it touched the
right eye and the eye-ball was a charred
mass arched down across the nose
which showed as a gaping hole lay bare
the right cheek so that the teeth and
quest of zipantoric



jawbones were visible cut a nasty gash
across the right shoulder and arm an-
other burn showed in the lower chest
and angled downward toward the
stomach

  pedro opened his left eye and in that
single orb was madness he tried to
squirm away into the darkness but no
strength was left in his body

  easy pedro burstone soothed
we are your friends what hap-
pened

  broken halting native dialect came
gaspingly from the torn lips his voice
was whining pleading markle could
not understand the words but burstone
leaned closer

  gods with tongues of fire from the
grave of the fire god the ethnologist
translated he says they chased him
and they touched him with their
tongues which burned like fire he
says he ran away from us because the
drums talked of the fire god saying
that the voice of the fire god had whis-
pered in the night and that the men
who serve the fire god were abroad
seeking seeking seeking  

  markle was sick at his stomach sick
with the meaning of the words and sick
with nausea at the sight of the gaping
teeth visible through the torn lips

  he says they are here now watch-
ing us    he says  

  the head of the native dropped low-
er he died

  very gently burstone laid the torn
body back on the earth his eyes
stabbed questions at zantha

  the poor forest child was struck by
a beam from the flame rod of a chosen
one a warden found him they
have no compassion these wardens
there was a tiny tremor in her voice
so they will treat us when they find
us   

  how does this heat rod work

  i do not know the wardens point
it at anything they wish to destroy a

bright light comes out and whatever it
is pointed at burns   

  will it operate from inside the gold-
en bubble

  the wardens are not permitted to
venture into the bubble that is re-
served for zantha the high priestess
im glad to learn that markle in-
terposed i have been afraid those
things would start dropping down on
us by the dozens

  they will not come in that manner
but they will come

  as she spoke a soft glow spread over
them it came on so softly and so
smoothly that they scarcely realized it
was happening zanthas sharp whis-
per brought burstone to his feet and
whirled markle around to face their
rear

j  all faintly bronzed statuesque a
 man faced them holding a short rod
from which flooded a blaze of soft light
he was naked except for a glittering
belt that circled his waist bands that
enclosed his biceps and a conical head-
piece the features were regular and
very calm no hint or trace of pas-
sion showed on that face neither
good nor evil was there only a vast
calmness that seemed to look down up-
on the world from a great height that
saw and understood and was unmoved
he looked like an ancient god from
out of the olden times before whose
eyes had passed unnumbered sacrifices
to whom had been offered incense and
smoke from the burning of flesh upon
the altars who had known fear and
worship down the long roll of the cen-
turies and who was unmoved by human
suffering

  a chosen one a warden of zipan-
toric   

  from his weapon streamed soft light
but markle knew that from that short
rod could come a beam that would sear
through a human body he knew it but


dynamic science stories

   he slipped the safety catch and
his rifle roared from his hip

  a tiny hole appeared in the throat of
the warden a red stream rilled down
the bronze chest   

  he did not move but over his face
shot a look of shocked surprise to a
chosen one had come a new thing it
reft his calmness as a mask is torn from
a mummer and the tortured face for
one wild second was the face of mom-
us the bullet piercing the throat had
shattered the spinal column  he
slumped to the earth

ill

markle caught a flash of
amazement from the mind of
zantha she had not thought
that this could happen before her eyes
a warden had died what manner of
men are these-markle caught the
thought-who can so easily destroy a
chosen one

  sweet joseph he heard burstone
mutter

  markle wanted that short rod from
which the soft light flooded the still
fingers of the warden gripped it he
loosened them carried it to zantha and
she showed him how it operated a
tiny button on the side controlled the
beam he pointed it toward the for-
est experimented with the button the
soft glow narrowed to a tiny ray almost
faded from sight the hole of a nearby
tree showed a spot of light then burst
into flame

  they left them there pedro and the
chosen one together in death and
went on

  the trail plunged down into a ravine
down which a small stream went the
terrain was rocky tortuous hard go-
ing burstone fought his way through
there was a world of endurance in that

wiry old body

  one by one the drums stopped faded
disappeared there was silence in the
jungle broken by the whimper of the
night wind in the trees by the rare call
of a bird or animal there was too
much silence in the jungle especially
behind them

  intruding in that silence came the
whistles

  zanthas keen ears heard them first
and she stopped abruptly markle stum-
bled against her saw that she was lis-
tening he called to burstone

  beginning with a faint piping far be-
hind them they came creeping closer
like elfin voices from the fairy world
distant shrill keen malevolent the
whistled notes came

  it is the madness zantha whis-
pered

  she caught the question in the minds
of the two men

  all that hear the whistles go mad
she explained they skip they jump
their bodies twitch their mind goes
away from them they become like chil-
dren  it hurts   

  nonsense markle ejaculated
how can whistles do that

  certain sounds properly pitched can
destroy matter burstone answered
i am not familiar with the process but
i know it is a problem of frequency
the right frequency impinging on a
human could destroy his mind tem-
porarily or permanently i suspect
that zantha knows what she is talking
about compared to the heat ray you
have the whistles would be childs
play

  what can we do

  nothing zantha answered and he
caught the hopelessness in her mind
they will come upon us in the dark-
ness and we will dance   

  they will dance he snarled if i
can find them with this rifle

  come on burstone ordered we
quest of zipantoric



may be able to outdistance them

  he plunged forward at a steady trot
that was almost a run

  the booming of the drums had been
the vainglorious chest-pounding of a
braggart the whistles incisively voiced
a far more deadly menace high thin
trilling notes they were that started
far up in the scale and went beyond
hearing markle wondered how the
wardens protected themselves from the
sound and questioned zantha but she
did not know

nytearer they came like a pack of
  whistling dogs hot on the trail of
running game at a spot where gigan-
tic boulders formed a natural fort
markle stopped

  take zantha and go on he said to
burstone ill give them something to
think about for a while and when
theyre thinking ill catch up with
you

  he had forgotten that zantha could
read his thoughts

  no deeck she said slipped her
hand through his arm if you stay i
stay too   

  beat it while youve got a chance

i	can hold them back for a time
you mean to die here that we may
have a chance to live she answered

  markle groaned burstone take
her with you if you have to drag her
hurry up those infernal screeches are
just around the corner and i can al-
ready feel them working on me

  the old scientist leaned against a
boulder his breath was coming in
great gasping pants

  no dick he answered i  i
stay here i cant go on anyhow this
old body    has carried me too far
now    ill play horatius   
you take zantha    and go   
with my blessing  

  the ravine which they had traversed
was hideous with a shrill cacophony of

sound from ahead of them in the di-
rection which they must go came a
shrill blast

  i guess none of us will go said
markle lifting his rifle and peering
vainly into the night for a target

  he moved away a few paces laid his
flashlight on a rock so that it would
illuminate the trail they had just trav-
ersed flipped the button and skipped
quickly away

  its broad white beam caught three
bronzed figures markles rifle roared
once twice one man slumped the sec-
ond fell and then crawled to the pro-
tection of a rock the third skipped
quickly away

  the screeching whistles stopped a
tiny beam of light came fingering over
the rock where the flashlight lay
touched it and the light burst into mol-
ten metal darkness came down and
in the darkness the raucous whistles
screamed angrily

  closer they came and closer and
shriller there was a trace of wild un-
earthly music in them the piping that
our forebears heard in the notes of the
goat-god something of orpheus was
there whose magic lyre charmed wild
beasts and moved trees to dance they
blended into sonorous cadence moved
up the scale went out of hearing

  zantha crouched against markle
he could feel her body tremble in his
brain a wild echo of those shrill sounds
beat and beat and beat his fingers
were moving jerking he lifted his
rifle threw aimless slug after aimless
slug into the night

  back into hearing came the notes
back down the scale and a soft gold-
en light came illumining the rocky
shelter wherein they crouched

  markle could see burstone still lean-
ing against the boulder where he had
taken up his position lines were
etched deep in the face of the ethnolo-
gist as markle watched he saw him

drop his rifle saw his fingers flex his
arms jerk burstone started shuffling
his feet

  in markles brain a trip-hammer
beat it found an echo in his muscles
each time the hammer fell his muscles
jerked his arms his legs would not
obey his will he found himself shuf-
fling an aimless two-step

  he saw the bronze figures close in
felt his arms tied behind him saw zan-
tha and burstone taken the whistles
stopped the trip-hammer subsided in
his brain strength flowed back to his
body

  that way said a bronze figure
pointing with guards ahead and
guards behind they started back over
the weary trail down which they had
fled

pvawn was in the sky when they
reached the city of zipantoric it
nestled in a depression well below the
level of the hills surrounding it

  in the mists of the morning they
could glimpse a huge ball surrounded
by smaller structures in reply to mar-
kles question zantha indicated that
this was the tomb of zipantoric

  they were taken to a small room
cut in solid stone their bonds were re-
moved and food was given them

  breakfast is served said burstone
grimly let it be said of us that the
condemned men ate a hearty break-
fast

  we will have no other said zan-
tha quietly tonight is the night of
sacrifice we shall see zipantoric

  they finished breakfast markle
found a crumpled package of cigarettes
in his clothing

  how do they manage this execu-
tion he asked blowing blue smoke to-
ward the ceiling the hand that held
the cigarette trembled

  zantha was seated on a stone ledge
that ran around the building

  they will take us    inside the
temple she answered her voice was
a gray echo in the dawn we shall see
zipantoric then they will bring us out
of the temple and tie us to the posts of
sacrifice on the ledge around the tem-
ple fire will leap from the temple
peak and we will be destroyed

  it sounds simple burstone com-
mented what is the nature of this fire
that will destroy us

  it is like lightning she replied
the high priest from inside the tem-
ple sets it free

  a further explanation she could not
give she did not know sometime in
the past there had been a mighty sci-
ence among the mayans but ages had
shrouded it and this lost remnant of a
people could not reproduce it in an-
swer to burstones question she told
them how tradition handed down from
the long past time said that zipantoric
came out of the sky accompanied by
other fire gods who left him there and
returned to the sky in their balls of fire
with instructions to this people that
they were to ward him forever the
fire gods from the sky had given this
colony of mayans much knowledge and
wonderful weapons had taught them
how to operate the golden bubble the
rod that burned the whistles they
were the chosen ones the wardens
and their duty was to destroy all stran-
gers who came near they had been
faithful to their trust for many cen-
turies how many she could not esti-
mate that was the legend from
what murky source it sprang burstone
could not understand

  why do they want to destroy you
markle interrupted you are one of
them you are their priestess

  because i have been touched have
been profaned they will name a new
priestess now

  markle looked at her im sorry i
touched you i didnt know   
quest of zipantoric



  she came to him do not be sorry
deeck    somehow inside of me i
am a little glad  

  he squeezed her hand

iv

death comes on swift relentless
feet to those who know the hour
when he will strike night soon
tossed its dark shroud over the last col-
ony of the mayans markle looking at
burstone knew that this day had aged
the old scientist the lines on his face
were deeply etched

  in their cell the three waited and
three guards came haughty and
poised was their bearing calm aloof
immobile their faces soft golden light
blazed from the rods they carried in
their hands their fingers were ready
on the buttons that would turn that soft
glow into a searing beam

  markle closed his mind he forced
himself to be terrified-he did not need
much forcing-to cringe over his
thoughts he put a rigid embargo bur-
stone and zantha did likewise

  out from their cell the wardens led
them one guard in front and two be-
hind burstone followed the first
guard then zantha then markle

  they reached the open and saw a
vast circle of people surrounding the
temple every head in that throng was
turned toward that huge ball which was
beginning to glow with a faintly lumi-
nous light

  a lane was clear through the crowd
down that lane the first guard marched
a muffled drum started throbbing its
slow measured beat wailed a dirge for
the dying

  zantha walked erect her head held
high courage that girl had her steps
never faltered her glance never strayed
aside

  she would see zipantoric she would
go to her god but she would not go as
a slave goes cringing and fearful

  over the crowd that hemmed in the
huge luminous ball a heavy tenseness
hung they were waiting    wait-
ing 

  the guards led on up the steps of
stone that led to the temple markle
saw the metal posts set around the ledge
well above the crowd a semicircle be-
low each of them was here elsewhere
the mayans crowded but upon these
semicircles they did not crowd

   at the top of the steps a somber fig-
ure met them wearing a mask garbed
in metal bright with ornament holding
the scepter of the feathered serpent
aloft in his right hand thin emaciated
age-weary the high priest of zipantoric
stood

  up the stone steps the high priest
led them the guard following and into
the door of the temple markle took
one look at that door and suppressed
an exclamation it was built of mas-
sive metal swung on a strange hinge and
it opened and locked from the inside
it opened into a small ante-chamber
which was as zantha had said he got
ready

  the two guards had just stepped in-
side the opening when he whirled his
left fist driving out with all the strength
in his hardened tendons it caught one
guard squarely in the stomach and
sank in through soft flesh breath
whistled out of the lungs of the guard
and a pained surprise leaped into his
eyes never before had one revolted
when he was to see zipantoric that
the condemned walk to their doom
erect was so firmly rooted in tradition
that their hands had not even been
bound zantha had foretold this

   without pausing in his stride markle
crossed with his right it thudded
home on the jaw of the second guard
who dropped his weapon slipped and


dynamic science stories

fell headlong down the steps outside
the first guard had doubled up like a
jack-knife the bronze of his face tinged
with green

  it had taken only a second

  markle needed only one glance to
know that he had nothing to fear from
the guards behind him for a few min-
utes he whirled to help burstone but
he saw that elderly ethnologist was do-
ing a very neat job of throttling the
first guard zantha had appropriated
his heat ray and was holding it trained
on the high priest

  it took them less than a minute to
kick the two guards and the high priest
down the steps and swing shut that mas-
sive door

curprise had gained them a tem-
k- porary advantage as the figure of
the high priest came rolling down the
steps an angry roar burst from the
crowd and as markle swung shut the
door men were dashing up the steps
a glance at the door told him that it
would withstand the charge of an army
and the heavy walls of the temple prom-
ised protection from the whistles

  a second door almost as heavy as
the first closed the small anteroom
they closed and locked it and found
themselves in a large chamber hang-
ing on pegs around the wall were what
looked like clumsy diving equipment
and a circular stairway led up to what-
ever was above

  zipantoric rests above said zan-
tha i have never been in that room
only the high priest may enter and
those who are to die   

  well go up said burstone grimly

  he went up markle saw him stick
his head through the opening saw him
pause heard an exclamation and he
disappeared into the room above

  markle and zantha followed they
found burstone standing in the center
of a large room a puzzled dazed ex-

pression on his lined face

  in front of him was what looked like
a large switchboard with meters rheo-
stats switches and all the parapher-
nalia necessary to control a heavy elec-
tric current

  it looks like the switchboard of a
power house markle gasped

  men this isnt possible burstone
muttered half to himself do you see
what i see or am i crazy

  something is wrong somewhere
here in this room is electrical equip-
ment that unquestionably has been de-
vised by a very advanced science the
mayan peoples never reached this stage
of development

  the people as a whole did not but
this colony evidently did burstone
answered man what a find the
equipment in this room will advance
electrical knowledge a hundred years
burstone had forgotten that he was a
man he only remembered that he was
a scientist

  yes markle replied drily if the
news ever gets back home there are a
thousand maniacs surrounding this
temple who would like nothing better
than to cut our throats   

  to zantha their words meant noth-
ing when they spoke of electricity she
got a mental image of lightning flashing
down from heaven she had no idea
that this mighty force could be con-
trolled bent to the will of man but
she held this room in superstitious awe
tradition told her what reposed in that
oblong container off to one side and it
was this coffin-like receptacle rising on
two columns a few feet above the floor
that riveted her attention when mar-
kle approached it she would have called
him back and when he insisted she
moved to his side he slipped an arm
around her found she was trembling

  do not go near that box deeck
she begged

  why not
quest of zipantoric



  zipantoric is there he will destroy
you  

  he can be no worse than what we
have already seen he answered mov-
ing forward she went with him

  markle glanced at the contents and
recoiled his exclamation called bur-
stone

  he steeled himself to look again

t ttterly nude bathed in a soft
 liquid light of the deepest imagin-
able shade of blue was zipantoric a
small body like that of a child covered
with sparse silver hair and a very wrin-
kled skin weak spindly legs rising to
a small torso and out of that a huge
chest so large that it made the head
seem less out of proportion for that
cranium was massive it looked as if
it could contain all the knowledge in all
the libraries of the earth and still have
room left over for more two wrinkled
lids marked the closed eyes the nose
was large and straight the mouth a
mere slit the features were composed
in the even calm of death

  it looks like a dwarf markle
breathed

  so it does burstone answered
like a member of the dwarf races that
folk tales say long ago inhabited the
earth but that is not possible either
for those legends can be traced back to
their source    and besides that
chest is out of proportion it looks as
if it had been evolved through centuries
spent in high altitudes in a thin atmos-
phere where oxygen is not plentiful

  it is zipantoric zantha said
now we shall die   

  long centuries of tradition told her
that those who saw the face of the fire
god would die markle tried to reas-
sure her but the fear had been born in
her and reason would not eradicate it

  we shall die deeck she said
calmly but i am not afraid

  good girl we arent dead yet and

before we check out some of those lads
outside are going to be mighty unhap-
py theyll have to starve us out if
we could only control that discharge to
the posts set around the ledge outside
they would be plenty uncomfortable
say-thats an idea how do they
work that

  the high priest he who wears the
jewel of the great one remains in here
and causes the lightning to strike i
do not know how it is done but the
lightnings obey none other than he
once another priest tried to usurp the
power and attempted to set off the light-
ning but the fire consumed him instead
of striking outside the temple  

  an electrical trap burstone
mused if you know the combination
it works if you dont know the com-
bination it works anyhow dick take
a look out of those openings around the
wall and see what our friends outside
are doing

  markle did not puzzle over the fact
that the openings were closed by several
inches of transparent material that re-
sembled glass they did not remind
him of portholes he had too many
other things to think about

  torches were moving through the
vast crowd outside the people were
shifting to and fro men were running
around the ledge of the temple he
recognized the high priest issuing or-
ders it looked like a disorganized
mass of ants but these were fighting
ants with stings it was only a ques-
tion of time he knew perhaps the
wise thing to do was to go down and
face the crowd death would come
quicker that way

a hum came from inside the room
 and he whirled burstone was
standing in front of the mighty switch-
board moving levers and punching but-
tons

  youre risking your life markle


dynamic science stories

shouted leaping to the side of the scien-
tist

  probably there is no danger bur-
stone answered we know it for a fact
that this controls the discharge i have
tried several switches and nothing has
happened except lights have flashed
there are two more switches  

  burstone turned held out his hand
dick  i wish you a lot of luck
 i have seen much of living it
does not matter if i see no more   

  markle not understanding took the
outstretched hand burstone wrung it
gave him a violent shove

  as he stumbled backward markle
saw the old ethnologist reach up and
grasp the switches his muscles tensed
the poles came down   

  a jagged streak of yellow flame rent
the air a living spear that clove bur-
stones body from head to toe there
came the gruesome odor of burning
flesh his body jerked sagged down-
ward his hands forever clenched
around the handles of the switches  

  in the silence that followed when the
discharge died out there intruded the
soft hushed tinkling of a silver bell   

v

markle disengaged the hands
gently laid the old body on the
floor a man had died   
in the thin hope that others might
live   

  there was an ache in markles
throat a gulping ache a choking cord
was tied around his heart and a mist
was before his eyes    during the
five years that had elapsed since he had
left college burstone had been a father
to him    now he was dead

  zantha stood beside him sorrow
showing on her face that kindly old
man who had never shown fear and

never complained was gone she had
known it would happen but she had
thought it would include her she could
not understand

  markle was stunned he did not see
the warden come up the winding stair-
way did not know that the heat ray was
aimed at him until the brutal command
came to turn around and lift his hands

  there wasnt a chance the ray
would sear before he could move and
others were coming up the steps

  it did not matter the end was writ-
ten but it did not seem to matter

  they had seen zipantoric now the
lightning would rend them dust would
blow from the ledge of the temple and
it would be the dust of their bodies but
it did not matter   

  zantha stood beside him straight as
an arrow poised her head erect   
her beautiful body would be seared by
a flash of screaming pain

  die here under the heat rays die
fighting death was inevitable their
only choice was in the manner of dying

  he tensed his muscles prepared to
leap at the throat of the warden

  his muscles wouldnt work they
wouldnt obey his orders something
was happening to the faces of the war-
dens they werent looking at him
they were looking over and beyond him
 in their faces was so vast a fear
that it was incomprehensible   

  centers above the higher centers of
markles mind sent alarmed sensations
through his brain cells he could feel
it something something he knew not
what    was here was behind him
his whirling movement was instinctive
it did not rise to the level of his con-
scious mind a gasping cry choked in
his throat

  blinking the sleep of ages out of his
deep-set eyes sitting up in the casket
where he had reposed so long was he
whom the mayans called zipantoric
with each passing second life was
quest of zipantoric



flooding through him more vigorously
he shook his head as a deeper does
when he awakens

  out of the corner of his eyes markle
saw the wardens drop to the floor to
them a god had risen zantha went to
her knees her eyes wide with awed
dread she pleaded with markle to
kneel but he shook his head in the
back of his mind he had the answer to
zipantoric yet it was an answer he
could scarcely believe   

  zipantoris lifted himself out of the
casket moved mincingly over to the
massive switchboard stared at the body
of burstone carefully studied the
meters

  the back of the creature was turned
with one leap markle could land astride
that body could throttle the being it
was an avenue of escape yet it was one
that he did not choose to take

  there was a tiny sound from the
stairway markle turned his head and
saw a warden there in the act of aim-
ing the heat gun the mayan had seen
the prostrate bodies of his comrades on
the floor and he had not recognized the
spindly-legged creature standing in
front of the switchboard

  watch it markle screamed

  zipantoric whirled like a cat and a
black spot leaped into existence on the
panel where the ray struck

jvtarkle got the impression of a

	 tremendous wave of mental force
a look of stunned surprise came over
the face of the mayan his grip on the
gun relaxed he slid awkwardly out of
sight zipantoric minced over and
peered down the opening then he
stepped to a port and for a long time
his gaze roved over the howling multi-
tude outside

  he turned back to the room and
markle felt those gleaming hypnotic
eyes fasten on him he was being com-
manded ordered to think back over

the recent past he found his mind run-
ning over all that had happened since
the golden bubble had appeared on the
pyramid of the sun he could feel his
past experiences draining out draining
into the mind of the creature facing
him

  there was a grim ghost of a smile on
the leathery face of zipantoric he
turned to zantha and markle knew
that he was probing her mind when
he finished with her she stood up
moved to markle stood trembling be-
side him

  for a long time he questioned the
mayans not a word was spoken not
a sound uttered

  markle knew that the fate of all of
them was hanging in the balance he
did not know whether or not he was
afraid his mind was still numb from
the shock of burstones death and the
ordinary emotions were not registering

  zipantoric came back looked from
zantha to him something heavy
pressed on markles mind he was be-
ing weighed all of them were being
weighed

  the weight lifted from his mind
zipantoric had reached a decision

  the mayans rose from the floor when
zipantoric turned to them like zom-
bies like the living dead they rose and
filed down the steps and out of the room
forever

  zipantoric pulled switches depressed
buttons on the switchboard a relay
clicked there was a scream and a throb
of current markle felt like he weighed
a ton and his knees started to buckle
zantha was clinging to him even zip-
antoric was holding to a projection on
the control panel

  intuitively markle knew what he
would see when he staggered to the port
and looked out yet he could scarcely
believe his eyes the city was gone had
vanished

  far below them bathed in thin moon-

glow was the immense globe of the
earth points of light showed here and
there thin white clouds passed be-
tween them and the dark expanse be-
low

  markle faced zipantoric

  what- he began

  zipantoric smiled

  no my son came the answer into
his mind you are not ready to know
all about me my home is out there in
space and i am going home long cen-
turies ago i was left here by enemies
and a race of earth-people set as guards
over me i slept away the long years
until your comrade pulled the switches
that set me free    now i am going
   home    your race is not ready
for the knowledge that i have it must
come slowly through centuries of evolu-
tion  

  but what    about us

  zipantoric continued smiling

 i hus the story almost ends it
needs only two newspaper clippings
to supply any necessary further infor-
mation

  the earth narrowly missed a collision
with a tremendous meteor last night if the
radio reports from three ships in the south-
ern caribbean are to be credited each

states that about  oclock last night a
tremendously large ball of fire came flam-
ing up from the south it dropped from
sight a few miles inland and it was first
thought to have struck the earth there but
a few minutes later it was again seen in the
air rapidly gaming speed and rising
within a short time it was nothing but a
tiny point of light in the sky and it soon
vanished entirely

  astronomers are at a loss to explain the
strange behavior of this meteor and are
inclined to doubt the veracity of the re-
ports news from the mainland however
indicates that the phenomenon was ob-
served there searching parties are setting
out to investigate the spot where it was
reported to have touched the earth

dear sir

  it appears to me that science has
completely disregarded athletics in its
investigations dont you think it has
overlooked an opportunity for profit-
able research-v s st clair mo

  the loss is probably to the athletes
rather than the scientists who will be
some time applying the results of the
other investigations with which they
seek to aid mankind as a whole but as
an example of sciences insatiable curi-
osity general electric engineers have
recently measured the speed of a box-
ers punch two photo-electric cells
were placed a foot apart so that the
subjects flying fist intercepted their
light beams and successively started
and stopped a split-second timer re-
sults showed that the boxer hit at the
rate of  miles per hour

  another investigator - a woman
strange to relate-has taken x-ray pic-
tures of a baseball pitchers grip in
hurling the rawhide fast balls slow
balls knuckle and curved balls were
the objects of her study but wags have
cast doubt on its seriousness by point-
ing out that her subject was a south-
paw just the same we believe were
not alone in wishing for a peep at a
shadow picture of fellers or deans
fingers as they let go at a baffled batter

  a more significant study by medical
men has been made of the physiological
process of a quintet of the worlds

greatest middle distance runners in-
cluding lash cunningham venzke
romani and fenske their speed was
found to depend largely upon the abil-
ity to attain a relatively high oxygen
intake other trained runners how-
ever though not as fast as this record-
breaking group of olympic heroes
nearly equaled them in this respect
only one factor could be found which
might be considered an inherent phy-
siological superiority of a superlative
runner rather than the result of his
better or harder training that was
lashs peculiar ability to raise his
metabolic rate when racing to 
times its basal level an increase above
that of runners of equal experience

  as a result of this discovery the in-
teresting possibility occurs that in the
future runners may be handicapped on
the basis of their metabolisms itiis be-
comes possible since ohio state univer-
sity physiologists have discovered that
cortin an extract of the cortex of the
adrenal glands increases muscular effi-
ciency by lowering oxygen needs
large doses of the extract are required
and it may be that the handicappers
will instead turn to the product of the
physicist deuterium or heavy water

  containing double weight atoms of
hydrogen known as deuterons heavy
water has strange effects on animals
experiments with mice have shown
that it is a strong stimulant to the sym-
pathetic nervous system causing the
hair to stand on end and the eyes to
bulge and that it speeds up the phy-
siological processes twenty per cent or
more this latter quality makes it a
perfect compensation for the runner
with a low basal metabolism but it is
a strange picture we are brought of the
track meet of the future with wild-
eyed dashmen hurling their deuteron-
charged bodies at the finish tape

  yet scientists have found much to
criticize in the handling of present day
meets disregarding the fact that
sound waves travel slowly starters in
some meets fire the gun from such a

position that the runners do not hear
the report for from one to four-tenths
of a second after the race has officially
begun times made in different meets
are not properly comparable under such
circumstances similarly in weight
throwing events officials often fail to
realize the importance of the relative
elevations of throwing circle and land-
ing point results are measured to the
fraction of an inch but in the shot put
when the flight of the weight at its ter-
minus is about  to the horizontal the
measured length of the put will be in
error by the same amount as the dis-
crepancy in elevation which may easily
be two full inches in the discus throw
because of the flatter trajectory of the
discus the effect is three times as ser-
ious

  but the greatest single mistake made
is failing to take gravity into account
in comparing records made in different
parts of the world weights are actu-
ally heavier at some places than others
jack torrences   shot put at oslo
norway would have been worth an
extra inch at rome at the equator
where the gravitational influence de-
creases still further in conformity with
the formula of the inverse ratio of the
square of the distance of the attracting
bodies the shot would have sailed an-
other two inches on the same heave for
the discus and hammer throws the addi-
tional distance would be still greater
and a good toss of the javelin would be
extended more than a foot

  and if it still seems that the scientists
are splitting hairs remember that
world records are often built on
fractions the tiny bit extra at the end
in fact take a table of the values of
the acceleration of gravity available
for nearly any place on earth and
after rectifying marks for this factor
see how many world records change

  if youd rather leave that to us well
do it in a subsequent issue and instead
let you work this problem with this nec-
essary data given how high could
walker johnson jump assuming he
could duplicate his world record effort
of   on an asteroid with one hun-
dredth of the earths diameter and the
same density

  simple yet it will give you a chance

chips of creation

dear sir

  how much is actually known con-
cerning the origin of meteors f i read
so many conflicting statements-a k
minneapolis minn

  it is little more than a hundred years
since the discovery that meteors were
actually celestial bodies and not terres-
trial or atmospheric at that time the
meteor paths in a great fall or
shower were traced back to a com-
mon center in the constellation leo
soon it was advanced that there was a
connection between the orbits of me-
teors and comets subsequent study
has confirmed the conclusion and today
at least six of the great meteor streams
through which the earth passes an-
nually have been identified with the
paths of comets hence the theory that
they are the debris of disintegrated
comets whose matter has been distrib-
uted around their orbits

  so much for the meteor swarms but
what of the individual meteors that fall
each day in countless numbers one
theory holds them to be fragments of
two lost planets brothers of the earth
which met destruction in some cosmic
cataclysm about  years ago
another considers them tiny chips left
over when the planets were thrown off
by the sun two billion years ago or
more the recent discovery of radio-
active material in meteors has enabled
physicists to date them by the same
method used in determining the age of
terrestrial minerals- and now neither
theory can be completely confirmed

  by this method different meteors
have been found to be as young as -

 years as old as two billion the
former could not have had their origin
in the sun for they would have had to
stay molten in space for ninteen times
as long as they have been solid and a
planet could not be the source of
meteors of both ages with such a wide
disparity between them other data is
obviously needed	f

  that is being supplied by the har-
vard observatorys new meteor speed-
ometer on the basis of its findings
orbital computations have been made
that indicate meteors are really minute
planets travelling like the earth
through the telescope



around the sun but this proves only
that they are now members of the solar
system and it gives no clue to the
process by which they became indepen-
dent bodies moreover not all the
meteors observed had planetary paths
some had hyperbolic orbits that indi-
cate an origin in interstellar space
chips of an older a distant strange
creation

  whatever their origin meteors con-
tain no elements not found on the earth
about thirty in all have been found in
them mostly the more common ones
gold and platinum however have oc-
casionally been discovered in small
quantities as have small diamonds
while at least twenty million meteors-
some estimates run to a billion-enter
the earths atmosphere daily few can
reach the ground before exploding from
the pressure or burning up from the
friction of their great speeds ranging
from nine to fifty miles a second only
about a thousand have been recovered
but not even that many bodies of hu-
man beings could be recovered from as
vast a city as new york if it were vis-
ited with a meteoric fall like that which
in  felled all the trees and killed all
the animal life in a  square mile
area in siberia such a catastrophe has
been suggested as the basis of the bibli-
cal story of the destruction of sodom
and gomorrah

closer stars

dear sir

  in the answers to the quiz in the
november issue of marvel your
companion s-f magazine alpha proxima
was given as the closest star hasnt a
new one been discovered that is closer
-l a r new york city

	the star listed as wolf  may be
closer it is not newly discovered how-
ever its failure to be credited as tops
in proximity to the earth is due to the
fact that astronomers have been unable
after considerable study to determine
exactly how far distant it is the star
with a visual magnitude of  can be
viewed through only the most powerful
telescopes its faintness is an obstacle
to precise observation but its parallax
has been tentatively figured as eight to
nine tenths of a second if this is con-

firmed wolf  is less than four light
years distant and is the closest star-
little more than twenty million miles
away

tee up the earth

  a number of readers have expressed
further interest in methods of determin-
ing the age of the earth see marvel
for november at the same time we
take this opportunity of answering cer-
tain other questions sent in individually
but forming a related group-ed

  highly ingenious is the method of
calculating earths age that esti-
mates the time required for the interior
to oool sufficiently to produce certain
observable effects on the surface
mountain chains are wrinkles produced
on the already cool crust by internal
shrinking together they represent
 of the earths surface and to raise
up their masses the radius of the globe
would have had to contract by 
the length of time required computed
on the basis of known thermal data
would be about two billion years

  more precise a figure is obtained by
measuring the breakdown of radioact-
tive potassium this is an isotrope
with an atomic weight of  as com-
pared with natural potassium at 
k as it is known by liberating an
electron becomes a particular type of
calcium which can be identified while
k disintegrates so slowly that only
one atom in a billion breaks down in a
year the rate of change into calcium is
known and from the amount of the lat-
ter discovered in association with it the
age of the earth is fixed at 
years it is interesting to note that the
potassium clock points so closely to the
 years indicated by the
uranium chronometer

  the discovery of radioactive potas-
sium a recent one has also solved at
least one scientific mystery formerly
there was no explanation for the
presence of helium gas in old miner-
als rich in potassium but now it is
known that the formerly unsuspected
radioactive isotrope of potassium when
it liberates an electron is left with an
excessive positive charge which it tends
to lose by disgorging a helium nucleus
the latter picking up electrons from

the surrounding matter becomes gas-
eous helium

  another mystery the tremendous
changes in plant and animal life during
the carboniferous age a quarter billion
years ago is also laid at the door of
k potassium plays a vital part in
life processes and its radioactive var-
iety formerly four to fifteen times as
prevalent may have been the case of
the earlier eras remarkable mutations
and rampant growths

  even less certainty exists concerning
the nature of the earths interior that
there is a definite core some half the
diameter of the earth is well established
thereafter we enter the realm of con-
jecture does the temperature rise ob-
served in bore holes c for every kil-
ometer continue to increase indefinitely
with the depth what is the effect of
the tremendous mounting pressure is
the core solid liquid or gas-or any one
of these in an unfamiliar form

  the latest theory to be propounded
approaches the problem with a view to
the conditions that must be met the
density of the core must be such as to
average with the crustal density of 
to bring the mean density to  the
core must furthermore be less rigid
than the shell to meet the requirements
of tidal phenomena and it must have
the faculty of obsorbing sheer waves
a metallic core heavily occluded or
packed with some gas such as hydrogen
seems best to meet these specifications

  experiments with the rare metal
palladium occluded with several hun-
dred times its own volume of hydrogen
have revealed it to possess the proper
qualities if this is the case the earth
may be said to resemble a golf ball with
rough skin and spongy elastic core
and the cry of the modem archimedes
should be not for a fulcrum but a tee

  the question however can not be con-
sidered closed there still remains such
puzzles as why it is sixty-three feet far-
ther from new york to london on new
years eve than on the fourth of july

race suicide

   sales mean jb-buy now   

dear sir

  what explanation is there for the
mass suicides of lemmings - ig
detroit mich

  the lemming a small arctic rodent
has great spurts of reproductivity
after population density reaches a cer-
tain limit mass migratory movements
are started to relieve pressure these
great marches sweep on with almost
hypnotic obliviousness until some ob-
stacle like a river is reached and there
the vast hordes still sweep on-to their
death

  blind biological forces cause these
creatures to multiply in disastrous num-
bers blind instinct-or the lack of
reason-causes them to follow a course
that relieves pressure on the race at the
expense of its component parts the in-
dividuals a deadly parallel has been
pointed out between the lemming and
man

  in a minimum of  years up to
 mankinds number grew to less
than  yet in the scant three
hundred years since then the popula-
tion has crested the two billion mark-
more than quadrupled

  of little avail to point to temporarily
favorable economic conditions to med-
icines slow conquest of disease and age
when plotted on the proper time scale
such a spurt of population growth ap-
pears in its true nature of an explosion
-or an epidemic the result of blind
biological forces

  and what of the other instinct the
still more blind instinct to adjust pop-
ulations by mass suicide mans march
is to war

  and the next war after science has
labored so well this score of years to
aid mankind may be race suicide
