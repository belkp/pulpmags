important

 announcement

a year ago with the november  issue the format of wonder
stories was reduced to a smaller size

 we believed at that time that the change to smaller size would be wel-
 comed by the majority of our readers and we continued printing the maga-
 zine at this size for a year

      it appears now however that the majority of our readers have not looked
 kindly on the change and during the year we were flooded with many thou-
 sands of letters the numbers of late have been increasing urging that we
 should return to the larger size

     most of the readers argued that a magazine of such educational value
 as ours should not be placed on a par with the pulp magazines of a more
 sensational type a large percentage of our readers seem to think that the
 larger size with smooth edges was more dignified and gave a better appear-
 ance to the magazine than the smaller size with its rough edges

      heeding these letters and the overwhelming preference of our readers
 we are going back to the larger size which we formerly printed with the next
 issue

      this issue therefore is the last that will appear in the small magazine
 size look among the large-size magazines for the next issue

a pleasant surprise

     the november issue of wonder stories will also give you a pleasant
 surprise-something that many readers have been asking for but which was
 not possible until now to give you

      you will not only be surprised but we are certain that you will also be
 highly delighted with another important change which will also be incorpor-
 ated in the november issue

      inasmuch as there will be a large demand for the next issue we advise
 you to place your order with your newsdealer at once so you will not be dis-
 appointed

the return of the cosmic gun

the return of the cosmic gun

rp he big tri-motor-	by the author of

 ed transport plane	tfce cosmic gun-

had been flying	

through the fog for the	the sllent scoure

past hour guided by radio direction signals the upper
suddenly its motors stopped functioning

the two pilots forward held a rapid consul-

         ened the fog the un-
dercarriage scraped
the roof of a barn and
one wing tore through
branches of a tree which the

tation while most of the passengers realizing
that something was
wrong but not knowing
what gazed helplessly
at them two or three
left their seats and
started toward the con-
trol compartment one
of the pilots opened the
door leading into the
main cabin and mo-
tioned them back

 nothing to be
frightened about he
said go back to your
seats

  but what has hap-
pened asked a nerv-
ous-looking elderly
man

 something wrong
with the motors well
make a perfectly safe
landing if you keep
cool

 henry carey and
bill adams were sit-
ting well forward in
the cabin they glanc-
ed at each other tense-
ly-

  fogs pretty thick
said adams cant
see much maybe we
wont hit anything

 looks bad does
it asked carey

  a life insurance
company wouldnt re-
gard us as good risks during the next five
minutes

  the plane glided downward with both
pilots staring intently below and ahead as
it neared the ground a sudden breeze light-

pilot at the controls made a sudden swerve
to avoid as it loomed out of the thinning
mist the wheels struck the ground bump-
ed for fifty yards over
a meadow and col-
lapsed throwing the
plane forward on its
nose

  most of the passen-
gers were badly shak-
en up and bruised but
none was seriously
hurt when the first
excitement was over
the pilots began ex-
amining the motors
finally one of them
started across the fields
to the nearest house

  what went wrong
adams asked the other
who remained with the
plane

  motors stopped
he replied briefly

  all three of them at
once

    he pilot glanced
at him you
was up there wasnt
you you know
whether they all stop-
ped or not

 adams eyes nar-
rowed it seems to
me that the plane had
been sent out in bad
condition its just
good luck we werent
all killed im going
to find out whos to blame

  sure and tell me when you find out
id like to meet that guy for about five
minutes

  adams looked at him keenly some-

  thatching the steadyss
    onslaught of the rack-
  eteer into every corner of
  our lives we often ask

  where will it end no
  one knows for it is certain
  that the more powerful the
  racketeer becomes the less
  resistance will he made
  against his further pro-
  gress

    naturally if the rack-
  eteer is to compete with
  law and order he must be-
  come organized he must
  make use of scientific in-
  struments and in a sense
  become respectable when
  that occurs the racketeer
  will disappear and in his
  place will appear a busi-
  ness carefully organized
  to prey upon other busi-
  nesses and perhaps upon
  the government

    from that time a war to
  the death is inevitable all
  the forces of the racketeer
  will be mustered against
  the full power of the law
  and the ensuing conflict
  will take the proportions
  of a great national war

    our author has taken a
look into the not too dist-

bodys been fooling with the motors
there aint nothing wrong with the mo-
tors

  not when all three of them go out of
commission at the same time

  im telling you the motors are ok
they stopped didnt they so you had
to make a forced landing in the fog

  the pilot stared at him suspiciously say
mister i aint doing no more talking you
can get all the information you want from
the office in chicago

  when will we reach chicago

  my buddys phoning for a relief plane
now you can wait for that or well send
you on by train if youve lost your nerve
adams drew carey to
one side lets get out
of here while we have the
chance he said ive
got a hunch that an at-
tempt was made to wreck
that plane to get you

  me asked carey in
astonishmqnt whod
want to kill me

 come on urged
adams we havent any
time to waste talking now

your names henry jones
and youre a salesman
for a st louis shoe con-
cern if anyone asks you

 y ou havent gone
mad bill

  adams paid no attention to the question
but hurried his friend towrard a road on
which passing cars were visible through
the thinning fog they climbed the rail
fence bordering it just as a commission
house truck loaded with watermelons came
along adams jumped in front of the
truck waving his arms the driver slam-
med on his brakes and slid to a stop

  he glowered at the two men good
thing im a church member and a dry most
ol the guys drivin along here would rather
kill a prohibition agent than not

  adams laughed were not prohibition
agents we were passengers in a plane
that crashed in a meadow half a mile back

there weve got to get to the nearest towrn
as soon as we can

  plane crashed eh the driver stood
up and gazed across the fields anybody
hurt

  all of us fruised a bit we were lucky
not to hit anything landing in the fog
ill say you was where do you want

to go

  any town that has a railroad station
im runnin into toledo that suit
you

  thatll do fine

  all right one of you can sit here in
front with me the other onell have to
ride with the melons

  you sit in front said
adams to carey ive
ridden on melons before
i was brought up on a
farm

a case of pre-
meditatidn

adams and carey
were graduated from
the university of chicago
in the same class ten
years before but their
careers had kept them
apart since except for an
occasional meeting carey
was professor of physics
at the university and fam-
ous for his discovery of
certain methods of energy control there
had been recent newspaper rumors of a revo-
lutionary discovery he had made that was
so dangerous in its possibilities that all in-
formation about it had been suppressed by
the federal government

  when bill adams left college he took a
job as reporter on the chicago tribune
he rapidly became the confidant of both
gangsters and corporation presidents he
went to washington as correspondent for
his paper and established intimate contacts
writh statesmen and lobbyists finally he
severed his connection with the tribune to
go abroad on confidential missions for the
state department

morrison colladay
the return of the cosmic gun



  now with carey he was on his way from
washington to chicago after a secret con-
ference with the president of the united
states

  

  as a chicago bound train pulled out of
the toledo station two hot and dusty men
raced down the platform and boarded the
last car ten minutes later they were in
a drawing-room with curtains down and
door locked

  adams grinned at carey who was ser-
ious get it off your chest henry he
said and youll feel better

  i feel all right but id like to know
why youve been rushing me all over the
country on a day as hot as this

  i told you before-to keep you from be--
ing murdered maybe you dont think thats
important but the government has uses for
you just at present -

  youre crazy bill whod want to mur-
der me

  ever hear of the ibpa-the internation-
al business protective association

  only what ive read in the papers
why

  evidently the ibpa has come to the con-
clusion that you and your ether wave gener-
ator are dangerous to their activities theyll
feel safer if youre killed in a plane crash
or some other accident

  carey laughed i dont believe the
ibpa ever heard of me

  youre top modest henry the govern-
ment rather expected an attempt on your
life when the news of your trip to wash-
ington leaked out sending you back by
plane seemed the safest way evidently it
wasnt as safe as we thought	

  you mean the stopping of the motors of
the plane in that fog was deliberate

  just as sure as youre sitting there the
chances against our making a safe landing
must have been fifty to one

  carey shook his head it doesnt sound
reasonable to me the pilots wouldnt take
a chance like that they couldnt kill me
without killing themselves

  the pilots didnt have anything to do
with stopping the motors

  how could anyone else stop them ask-
ed carey incredulously

  look here henry said adams earnest-
ly youve got to take some of the things
im going to tell you on faith were up
against a serious proposition you say youve
read things in the papers about the ibpa
but the papers darent print half they
know

  why not

  because the ibpa is the most powerful
organization in the world today its a com-
bination of the old gangsters and profession-
al criminals with all the dissatisfied ele-
ments in every country it preys on business
all over the world a speakeasy bombing
in chicago or a war in china are equally
likely to be its doing no newspaper dare
antagonize it

                   

carey laughed maybe a newspaper
couldnt but the government could
youve been a reporter so long bill youve
lost all sense of proportion why if an
organization got as powerful as that all the
governments in the world would combine to
destroy it as a measure of self preserva-
tion

  correct henry and thats exactly what
is happening now i cant tell you all the
details of the plan yet but your going to
washington was part of it weve had to
move carefully because we cant tell whom
to trust police district attorneys judges
members of congress all belong to the
ibpa it has unlimited wealth its spies
are everywhere its so powerful that most
people feel its safer to be on the side of
the ibpa than against it

  well even if this is all true what has
it to do with stopping the motors on our
plane today

  everything the ibpa has the finest
laboratories in the world and a very clever
staff of scientists and inventors working for
it not only in this country but abroad it
has developed at least two very dangerous
secret weapons that the government has
learned about doubtless there are others

  carey looked unconvinced why do they
need dangerous secret weapons theyre


wonder stories

just blackmailers and racketeers on a big
scale arent they

  not any more thats the way they
started off but theyve grown so strong that
theyre ready to precipitate a revolution the
first time they have a good excuse the men
back of the ibpa have been getting ready
for ten years for a conflict with the armed
forces of the government

  whats the idea what have they to
gain  

  adams shrugged his shoulders maybe
theyre tired of being called racketeers and
gangsters besides theres a nut at the
head of the ibpa who thinks hes destined
to be the ruler of the world or something
like that

   it sounds like a dope dream to me sure
youre not imagining it bill

  listen henry i told you the ibpa has
two dangerous weapons that the government
tiows about one of them they call the
arrestor ray and among other uses it par-
alyzes the ignition systems of all internal
combustion engines thats how they stop-
ped the motors of our plane today

  carey looked thoughtful  suppose
thats possible he said i remember there
were newspaper reports a few years ago
about the trial of some such ray by the ger-
man army  seem to remember the german
government denied the whole thing

  you wouldnt expect them to acknowl-
edge it would you suppose when the next
war starts france sends a fleet of planes
to bombard the german cities the ger-
mans raise a barrage of the rays and the
planes fall to the ground you bet they
wont acknowledge it

   well said carey even if the germans
have the secret of paralyzing ignition sys-
tems from a distance it doesnt follow that
the ibpa knows it

   the government has satisfied itself about
that one of the secret service men dis-
guised as a mechanicjoined the ibpa and
managed to get reports to headquarters de-
scribing this weapon and another one he
called a detonating ray machine unfor-
tionately this man disappeared mysteriously
about six months ago or we might know
a lot more than we do

  whats the detonating ray supposed to
do

  its a machine which will set off any ex-
plosive at a distance of at least ten miles
well theyve got something if theyve
got that said carey it puts the govern-
ment in a nasty hole if your friends the
ibpa really want to start a revolution
doesnt it they could blow the army to
bits before it got near enough to fire a shot
washington realizes that thats why
its moving so carefully before you in-
vented your generator it had only one
chance to break up the ibpa now of
course it has two

  what was the first one

  locate the headquarters and workshops
of the ibpa and destroy them and all their
equipment by a surprise attack

  well that looks comparatively simple
why dont they do it

  because we dont know where they are
that doesnt seem possible but its true

  it ought to be an easy jqb for the secret
service

  let me tell you something seventeen
operatives who have been assigned to that
job have mysteriously dropped out of sight
one after the other what we know is abso-
lutely nothing except that the ibpa has the
two machines ive told you about and is go-
ing to try to get control of the government
in the near future

  perhaps they wanted the government to
know that suggested carey

  maybe they did of course the machines
wont be any good against your ether wave
generator youve given the government a
fighting chance

carey nodded you think the men
who control the ibpa have found out
about my generator and are trying to get
me out of the way

  thais it your discovery came at a bad
time for them theyve got all their plans
made to seize the government and set up a
dictatorship they have to prevent the
government from using your new machine
if theyre to be successful

  what makes you think they know about
the return of the cosmic gun



the generator asked carey nothing
definite has been published about it

  i guess they have a pretty good secret
service of their own i have a copy of a
mimeographed letter that was intercepted in
mail addressed to a suspected congressman
adams ran over the pages in a wallet
here it is he read aloud what is
known as an ether wave generator has been
invented by professor henry carey of the
university of chicago if the claims made
for it are true it is undoubtedly the most
dangerous weapon over constructed it gen-
erates a new kind of energy which blankets
 destroys all other forms

   the theory of the machine is not under-
stood but apparently all matter in the
area reached by the waves disintegrates in-
stantly it is urgently necessary that addi-
tional information as to the construction of
this machine be secured without delay
carey took the sheet of paper from adams
hand he gazed at it thoughtfully

  you see henry continued adams
theyre fools if they dont try to get you
out of the way what good will their de-
tonating machines or any other weapons be
against your generator 

  not much if we dared use it

  whats to stop your using it

  were afraid of it even the smallest ex-
perimental machine is so dangerous that we
havent been able to test it satisfactorily
adams stared at him what about the
big one you built on that forty-ton trailer out
at the naval station

  its built but weve never tried it i hope
well never have to

  you mean if you used the generator you
might start something you couldnt stop
something like that we might-

chapter ii
a meeting with the i b p a

       ickets please called a voice

  x adams reached over and turned
the catch on the door all right he said

  two men came into the room and closed
the door behind them

  i guess you didnt expect us said the

older one with a not unpleasant smile we
figured if we sent in our cards you wouldnt
be home

  the speaker was a short stout man of
about forty who resembled rather the pic-
tures of napoleon he had dark restless
eyes and a high forehead which retreating
hair made higher the younger man with -
him looked like a prize fighter and was evi-
dently a bodyguard

  hello angelino said adams this is
an unexpected honor he turned to carey
this is angelo angelino who is a very
important man in the ibpa im not sure
he isnt the most important man in the or-
ganization

  never mind the flowers bill said an-
gelino you aint sore about us butting in
this way

  thats a small matter said adams af-
ter trying to bump us off in that plane
crash

  angelino frowned not me i aint a
damned fool his manner and speech
changed too zealous subordinates too
much zeal and not enough brains it is
most important to the ibpa that professor
carey remain alive

  adams looked puzzled i dont get you
poof its very simple we know why
professor carey went to washington we
know about the ether wave generator he
has invented we might not have minded if
he had met with an accident on the way
east when no one except himself knew the
secret of his invention now when the war
department knows the secret it would be
very unwise for us to destroy the simplest
way of learning it ourselves

  adams nodded i see youre going to
try to force carey to give you the infor-
mation the government possesses

  we never use force unless we have to
angelino eyed the two men steadily like
most people you misunderstand and under-
estimate the ibpa many of the greatest
minds in the world today belong to the
organization powerful as it already is its
only at the beginning of its activities it
controls governments now before long it
will replace them inefficient and corrupt
democracy will be succeeded by the rule of


wonder stories

the strong for the benefit of the strong
both you professor carey and bill adams
here belong with us

  carey laughed and angelino glanced at
him questioningly the suggestion amuses
you professor

  it does rather of course all i know
about your organization is what ive read
in the newspapers they seem to agree that
the ibpa is a gang of racketeers and black-
mailers you acknowledge that it tried to
murder adams and me a few hours ago
now you calmly ask us to join it doesnt
that strike you as amusing

  angelino smiled perhaps it is were
apt to fix our eyes on results and ignore
the means necessary to attain them as for
the newspapers were strong enough so we
dont find it necessary to justify ourselves
no matter what they say besides were
more or less grateful to them

  adams looked at him curiously i bet
that would surprise them if they knew it
i dont know why it should two chi-
cago papers started the ibpa if they only
knew it years ago they hired muscle men
to beat up each others newsboys we found
out that a newspaper could get away with
murder a lot of us realized that law was
meant for the little fellow then prohibi-
tion came along and we were stronger than
the newspapers we were making millions
and the police and judges and politicians
were waiting with their tongues hanging out
for their rake-off

  you saw that they got it of course
naturally even at the beginning we
never did any fighting we didnt have to
the papers talk as if we were bloodthirsty
-murderers thats all boloney were
business men and always have been of
course if a guy interferes with us too much
he isnt a good insurance risk

cl arey leaned forward in his interest
j  i still dont see how you got so power-
ful as you seem to be you must have some
remarkable men in your organization
we have but we could have grown big
without them you see all we did was to
take over the jobs other guys had been
doing and do them better they didnt

call these other guys racketeers and gang-
sters not by a damn sight they were pri-
vate detectives and corporation police and
deputy sheriffs and strike breakers

  and you consider youre doing the same
work as these other agencies you claim to
have displaced

  sure were doing it and doing it a hell
of a lot better than they ever did the
american bankers association used to pay
the burns men for protecting their banks
now they pay the ibpa and there aint any
bank robberies the big corporations used
to pay the pinkertons for their strong arm
work now they pay us strikes used to
cost a lot of money now if a corporation
pays its fees it dont have to worry about
strikes

  suppose the men strike anyhow in-
quired carey curiously i dont suppose
you control all the unions

  the union officers obey orders its not
healthy for them not to

  how far does the system extend
angelino shrugged his shoulders most
business men pay for protection and get it
we take care of them and they dont have
to do any worrying

  how about the man who refuses to pay
for protection

  he soon finds out how bad he needs it
if he isnt a fool he fixes things up with
us

  suppose hes stubborn and keeps on
fighting you

  there arent many of that kind they
dont bother us much they dont stay in
business long have an accident usually
i see

  now dont get this wrong angelino
said earnestly it isnt fair to the man
whos paying for protection for the other
guy to get by without it

  see here angelino interrupted adams
why are you telling us all this you know
im still a newspaper man

  sure i know that but youre both big
men thats the reason i can talk to you
i dont have to fool you i told you the
ibpa never fights for a thing it can get
any other way we canmse both of you
the ibpa is in a position to do more
the return of the cosmic gun



for you than anyone else could wait a
minute he said as adams started to pro-
test im not talking about money for
professor carey unlimited resources for
whatever scientific research he desires to en-
rgage in for you bill unlimited power
and influence in charge of both publicity
and propaganda for the ibpa

  adams flushed angrily but before he
could speak carey took the situation out
of his hands

   theres no use refusing mr angelinos
offer without considering it carefully bill
he said i want to ask him a few ques-
tions he turned jo angelino you dont
mind do you

   shoot professor

   youve been quite frank about the meth-
 ods of the ibpa how do you justify them
 ethically it wouldnt be any of my busi-
 ness naturally if you werent asking me to
 become associated with you

  were practical men answered ange-
lino we dont believe governments should
be run for the benefit of the weak justice
liberty right and wrong we believe are just
words life is a struggle and the rewards
go to the strong and ruthless thats our
philosophy in a nutshell its the phil-
osophy all strong men live by no matter
what they profess

  i understand said carey you said
something about the ibpa actually taking
over the government of this country did
you mean that seriously

   certainly the ibpa is really the secret
 government of the united states now were
 going to kick the stuffed shirts out it wont
 be long

   you mean youre going to start a revo-
lution

   it wont be important enough to call a
revolution angelino said we give the
word and the presidency congress and the
courts are abolished the ibpa takes over
the country and runs it on a business basis

it occurred to carey that the man was
insane and the thought must have shown
ii his expression

   angelino shook his head im not crazy
 it wont be much of a change most govern-

 ment officials are figureheads now we tell
 them what to do and they do it

  its going to be a pretty big job isnt
it asked carey theres the army and
navy i dont believe you control them
then the hundred million or so people
who live outside the cities-

  angelino waved his hand indifferently
were ready for them all we can wipe
the army and navy out of existence in an
hour if we avant to the hundred million
people youre talking about wont resist
long what do you suppose our laborator-
ies and workshops have been doing for the
past ten years besides most people will
probably be glad to have us take over the
government

  adams who had been listening laughed
at this point what makes you think theyll
be glad he asked sarcastically

  because the average man is pretty level
headed hell find out when we start out
to do anything we get results well abol
ish crime there wont be any police forces
or prisons i guess that sounds funny to
you but we wont need them things will
be organized business will contribute to
the government just as it does now to us
there wont be any room for criminals well
cill them traitors and- he shrugged his
shoulders-and exterminate them

  suppose i should publish your plans
angelino said adams

  you wont if you become one of us
  and if i turn your offer down

  you wont have the opportunity to pub-
lish them

  i see carey and i either join the ibpa
or else-

  angelino smiled deprecatingly you
dcnt have to worry bill you and the pro-
fessor will be our guests for say a couple
of weeks after that it wont make any dif-
ference what you publish

  adams noticed that angelinos gorilla
seemed bored by this long conversation he
was standing with his back to the door his
gaze fixed vacantly on the landscape flying
by the windows angelino was sitting fac-
ing carey both men intensely interested in
the discussion adams was lounging in the
wash room doprway


wonder stories

  bill had been amateur boxing champion at
the university and he had kept himself in
fair condition he decided to take a chance
though he was unarmed and the gorillas
forty-five automatic was visible in a shoul-
der holster suddenly he leaped forward
as the train swung around a curve the gor-
illas head smashed back against the door
from the force of the blow on his chin and
he sank slowly to the floor

  adams snatched the forty-five from its
holster and whirled toward angelino who
had turned at the sound of the blow

 up with them snapped adams then
he grinned i always said you guys werent
so hot with the rods thats why you use a
machine gun to get a man keep em up
he ordered sharply as angelino started to
lower his hands come over here and take
this gun henry

chapter iii
in hiding

caleb paxton lived in a french cha-
teau which stood in the middle of a
large estate at winnetka there was a pri-
vate dock and lying off shore a yacht big
enough-to cross the ocean

  do you suppose hell see us carey ask-
ed adams as the two men stepped out of a
taxicab at the door

  hes been waiting for me adams ex-
plained i was to report to him as soon
as we reached chicago

  a butler who evidently recognized adams
ushered the two men into a reception room
ill tell mr paxton youre here

  a moment later a worried-looking man of
about sixty hurried into the room he gave
an exclamation of relief when he saw adams
and waved the butler out closing the door
behind him

  are you all right he asked ive
been trying to locate you for hours

  gilt edge adams assured him this
is professor carey mr paxton

  mighty glad to see you too carey said
paxton offering his hand the state de-
partment was on the phone only five min-

utes ago trying to get information about
you

  whats all the excitement asked
adams weve had plenty of adventures
but nobody could have known about them
already

  you think so do you all the papers
had scare heads about the plane crash first
they had you and carey killed then this
was denied by the transport company they
insisted that you werent injured either of
you but that youd mysteriously disappear-
ed i phoned the police departments of all
the nearby towns but no one had seen you
now that just shows the efficiency of the
ibpa said adams we got a truck to
give us a lift into toledo right after the
crash and we caught the chicago train as it
was pulling out the police didnt know
where we were but the ibpa did angelino
got on the same train

  angelino exclaimed paxton frowning
youve seen him

  we not only saw him we had a long
talk with him said adams as a matter
of fact he told us all about the plans of
the ibpa theyre going to take forcible
possession of the national government in the
course of the next few weeks

  youre joking

  i was never more serious in my life an-
gelino invited us to join the ibpa he said
if we didnt hed kidnap us and keep u lock-
ed up until the happy event took place
but you got away from him

  were here arent we we put some-
thing over on angelino this time

  paxton was pacing nervously up and
down the floor tell me exactly what hap-
pened what did angelino tell you well
have to decide whats to be done

  adams began well after those rumors
got out about careys ether wave generator
we knew wed have to get him to washing-
ton secretly if we didnt want him murdered
before he got there we got him there all
right we thought he wouldnt be in much
danger on the return trip because the ibpa
would realize that killing him wasnt going
to suppress knowledge of the generator

  we allowed the information to leak out
that the government was in possession of
tiie return of the cosmic gun



full plans and specifications for the machine
still it wasnt worthwhile taking unneces-
sary risks and we decided the safest way
for carey to return to chicago was by
plane

  it doesnt seem to have been particular-
ly safe paxton remarked

  thats because the ibpa used one of their
ray machines on us they paralyzed the
ignition of the motors on our plane while it
was flying in a heavy fog we landed safe-
ly but it was a fifty-to-one shot we
wouldnt

axton frowned ive never believed
any of those ray machine romances
the motors of your machine stopped and
youre just guessing why

  its more than a guess said adams
remember it was a tri-motored plane all
three of the motors stopped at once though
the pilots declared they were in perfect con-
dition before and after then angelino ad-
mitted that an attempt had been made to kill
us he said it was the work of over-zealous
subordinates-men with too much zeal and
too little brains

  well-never mind about that now tell
me what happened after you landed

  i figured theyd try some other way of
killing carey as long as the first plan fail-
ed i thought d better get him to chicago
as quickly as possible there was an auto-
mobile road a half mile from where we
ci ashed and we got a ride on a truck going
into toledo we jumped a chicago train
just as it was pulling oufc

  i cant see how angelino got on your
track said paxton

  neither do i i thought wed made a
clean getaway it was about an hour after
wed left toledo i guess when angelino
shoved into our drawing-room he had one
of his gorillas with him

  did he recognize you

  of course ive known him ever since
i was a reporter on the trib

  what did he say he wanted

  he invited cary and me to join the
ibpa he spent an hour telling us all
about the organization and what it was go-
ing to do

  i suppose that suggestion made a hit
with you

  adams grinned i started to tell him
what i thought but carey stopped me in-
stead of flatly refusing to join he tempor-
ized i realize now that was the safest thing
to do

  how did you get rid of him finally
tou never used to carry a gun

  i dont yet neither does carey you
remember i used to be a pretty good boxer
i dont think either angelino or the gorilla
had any idea wed try to get away i saw
the gorjlla wasnt watching me and i wait-
ed till the train gave a lurch then i jump-
ed him-knocked him out and grabbed his
automatic the rest was easy we tied
both of them up and gagged them and put
them away in the washroom we got off the
train at gary just as it was leaving the sta-
tion took the interurban to chicago and
changed to a taxi as soon as we saw one
chicago didnt seem exactly a healthy place
for either of us just now so we thought
wed visit you for a while in winnetka

the menace

paxton frowned in thought you
boys will both have to keep out of
sight thats one thing sure he said your
lives wont be worth a plugged nickel in
chicago

  still ive got to stick around where i
can be in touch with things said adams
its more important now than ever the
ibpa is going to make some move almost at
once im convinced of that from what an-
gelino said arent you henry

  carey nodded it sounded that way
that means well have to advance our
attack and get in ahead of them

  thats easier said than done paxton
objected did you get any definite instruc-
tions in washington

  sure simple enough find the head-
quarters of the ibpa and destroy them the
slate department is sure the nerve center
of the organization is somewhere near chi-
cago if we can locate it and make an un-
expected attack well have the fight pretty
well won


wonder stories

  i dont believe finding the headquarters
is as important as getting rid of angelino
said paxton hes the brains of the whole
outfit the best thing to do is to arrest
him and fix it so somebody shoots him acci-
dentally

  thats a brilliant idea replied adams
one of this lieutenants will step into his
saoes and well be just where we are now
except well have lost the sympathy of the
public

  how are we going to be any better off
if we discover the ibpa headquarters
well make a sudden attack and seize the
arrestor ray machines and the detonators
theyll be fairly helpless if we do that
paxton shook his head i dont take
any stock in those super-scientific gim-
cracks ive been saying all along the thing
to do is to get the president to declare mar-
tial law the gangsters wont last long
against the army

  youre wrong about that paxton the
ibpa can destroy any troops we send against
it

  you mean to say that a bunch of rack-
eteers can whip the united states army
youre crazy adams

  im not the one whos crazy angelino
could destroy the whole army before it got
within ten miles of him

 how

  thats one of his secrets all we know
positively is that he can do it he can het
off any explosive at a distance by a radio
wave tuned to the right frequency to de-
tonate that particular explosive

  nonsense exclaimed paxton it isnt
possible why if that was true he could
set off the ammunition in an arsenal or
blow soldiers to pieces with their own cart-
ridges

  adams nodded thats just it wash-
ington has a full report on what the machine
does but not how it works

  paxton sank into a chair if they can
do that whats the use of fighting them
what chance have we got

  thats where carey comes in thats
the reason we took him to washington and
why hes so important to the ibpa his

ether wave generator makes all their
machines useless

  paxton turned to carey is that true
  yes if we dare use it

  look here professor said paxton
tell me candidly what you think of the
situation were up against youve seen an-
gelino and had a chance to size him up and
youve been listening to our friend adams
here

  carey hesitated im so new to this
enterprise that i hardly feel i should do
any criticizing

  go ahead and criticize said paxton
we want you to dont we adams

  sure nodded adams you cant hurt
our feelings

  it seems to me began carey thought-
fully that there must be something serious-
ly wrong with the secret service and your
oiganization if you havent been able to find
out where the ibpa headquarters are after
all factories and laboratories cant be hid-
den very well if theyre at all extensive

 srp hats what we thought when we
jl started said adams but we have-
nt been able to discover them

  you think you can trust all the men who
are working with you in this fight on the
ibpa

  we think so but of course we cant be
sure thats why no one except certain
officials in washington are familiar with
all thats being done the ibpa draws its
members from all classes of society as
far as we can tell its more like the old
sicilian mafia than any other organization
which has ever existed i have no doubt
that there are governors and high federal
officials among its members certainly it
controls the big city police authorities and
criminal courts thats what makes our
work so difficult and dangerous

  maybe weve bitten off more than we
can chew said paxton

  not if we dont lose our nerve answer-
ed adams if we succeed in locating and
destroying the ibpa headquarters and then
arrest angelino and his chief lieutenants
these other adherents will desert like the
rats they are theyll tumble over them-
the return of the cosmic gun



selves to line up on the side of law and
order

  how do you know the ibpa hasnt spies
watching all of you asked carey

  we dont know it they probably have
we can be reasonably sure they havent dis-
covered yet what were planning to do or
we wouldnt have been left undisturbed
carey turned to paxton i hope you can
trust all your servants mr paxton

  you neednt worry about that answer-
ed paxton a little pompously i demand
lcyalty from the people who work for me
and i get it of course i pay for it he
added as an afterthought

  carey nodded still i imagine the
ibpa would pay more if it suspected your
present activities

  paxton looked startled i guess thats
right i hadnt thought about that particu-
lar danger perhaps wed better go out
to my yacht to finish our discussion it
will be the best place for adams to hide
urtil the showdown anyhow

  an hour later the three men were seated
comfortably around a table in the luxurious
cabin of the wild goose

  it seems to me carey was saying that
you fellows fighting the ibpa are wasting a
lot of time first thing you know ange-
lino will get the jump on you if the men
back of the ibpa actually get possessipn of
the government its going to be hard to dis-
lodge them with public sentiment as indif-
ferent as it is

  if youll show us how to hurry things
well do it answered adams a little im-
patiently what can we do we might
arrest angelino and a few of his lieutenants
but we couldnt even keep them locked up
tell me one thing said carey whos
going to do the actual fighting in this war
youre planning where are your men
you neednt worry about that replied
adams we have them in every city in the
country ready for action on receipt of or-
ders here in chicago we have enough of
them to take possession of the city even if
we find the ibpa controls the entire police
force

 whos supposed to give the order

  i am if im alive if anything happens

to me in the meantime there are six other
men any one of whom can start things mov-
ing

 a nd youre waiting until you locate
l the ibpa headquarters thats it
is it

  thats it until we locate and capture
their headquarters we cant safely make a
move

  carey turned to paxton id like you
to run me back to the city in the yacht if
you dont mind you can land me at the
chicago yacht club

  the two men stared at him in astonish-
ment getting ready to commit suicide
asked adams

  not exactly i have an idea i can lo-
cate the ibpa headquarters and workshops
for you

  youre crazy what chance have you
got after what happened this afternoon
youll be shot down on sight

  i dont believe that bill you remember
i didnt refuse angelinos offer i helped
tie him up but you had a gun i think i can
make him believe i was afraid to do any-
thing else

  adams shook his head its too danger-
ous if he ever suspects youre double-
crossing him youll have a nasty finish
all the same its worth trying when
we reach the city ill go to my house it
wont take angelino long to find out im
there he wants that ether wave generator
of mine as he said this afternoon it
wouldnt be convenient for me to be dead
a long as the government has the secret and
the ibpa hasnt while im alive hell
believe theres a chance of learning it
suppose angelino does tackle you
asked paxton what do you intend to
do

  accept his offer to join the ibpa that
wont surprise him hell think its the
sensible thing to do if he trusts me hell
take me to the ibpa laboratories and put
me to work making an ether wave genera-
tor for him

  what good is that going to do us if
he takes you there you can bet he wont


wonder stories

trust you enough to run the risk of your
getting away

  if i get to the laboratories ill manage
the rest somehow

  but how persisted adams

  i cant tell till i find what im up
against

  you wont have a chance theyll watch
you like a hawk you couldnt get a mes-
sage out in a thousand years

  look here bill im not going to tell
anybody my plans but if i reach the ibpa
headquarters ill get a message to you with-
in twenty-four hours

  if he feels that way about it i think
we ought to let him use his own judgment
paxton said to adams

  go ahead then said adams throwing
up his hands but i think its a damn fool
stunt

chapter iv

                                                            i

carey joins

careys living quarters were on the
second floor of a large house near the
university the ground floor and basement
had been converted into workshops and lab-
oratories a negro cook and a maid took
care of the living quarters the laboratory
was in charge of a middle aged mechanical
genius named mike kelly who had assisted
carey for years and knew more about his
work than anyone except carey himself

  carey left the wild goose at the yacht
club and reached the house about midnight
when the two servants appeared in the morn-
ing he dismissed them for the day he then
gave mike certain instructions and sent him
away much against his will

  carey busied himself in the laboratory
while he waited shortly after ten oclock
the telephone rang and he heard the voice
he had been expecting

  this is angelino professor

  yes i recognized your voice

  did you expect to hear from me

  i did rather after what you said in the
train yesterday

  your friend adams is a smart guy

  i was sorry about that still you didnt

handle him very diplomatically threats
dont do much good with a fellow like
adams

  to hell with him what about you are
you going to join us

before i decide id like to talk things
over with you i want to find out exactly
what ill have to do when can i see you
ill be at your place in twenty minutes

  in rather less time a large black limou-
sine stopped before careys door and five
men got out one of whom was angelino
two of the men remained outside the other
two accompanied angelino into the house
and made a hurried search from cellar to
roof while he remained in the vestibule

  you mustnt mind them he said to
carey a good many guys would like to
bump me off so we dont take any chances
lets get down to business

  suppose we go into the laboratory
suggested carey

  how woulc fifty thousand a year strike
you asked angelino when they were alone
i guess youre getting about ten now
how do i earn the fifty thousand
well this aint any charity stunt well
get our moneys worth you start off build-
ing some of your ether wave generators for
us

  carey nodded i thought thats what
youd want me to do it will take time of
course

  sure we know that its  k with us
weve got things all planned to take over
the government and we dont want to do
any more fighting than we have to

  the government has one of the ether
wave generators you know

  what good will it do them if they
havent got you youre the only guy
knows how to work it arent you

  carey shrugged his shoulders i know
more about it than anyone else of course
angelinos smile was grim i could
see yesterday you werent anybodys fool
carey you see our position we couldnt
let the government use you if you didnt
come with us we had to bump you off
some of the boys decided bumping you off
was the best way anyhow and you know
the return of the cosmic gun



what happened to your plane i had an
idea youd be more useful to us alive
thats why i made the proposition i did
on the train yesterday

 when you got away with adams i
didnt believe i could do any more to save
you and i was sorry i like you pro-
fessor then we found youd come back
to your house i thought id give you a
last chance thats why i phoned

  carey nodded i knew that was about
the situation i prefer staying alive of
course so it didnt take me long to decide
what do we do now

  angelino looked at him admiringly
say carey i meant it when i said i like
you lots of guys have brains and lots
of em have guts but they generally dont
come in the same package lets get go-
ing

carey thought that the building to
which he was taken was on quincy
street but he was not sure the car
stopped at the entrance and he was hustled
down a flight of stairs to the basement at
the street end was an entrance into a tun-
nel he stared in surprise as a train sped
by

  freight subways said angelino not-
icing his wonder i bet you never knew
chicago had any subways

  i suppose i must have known but i cer-
tainly never saw them before how exten-
sive are they

  sixty-five miles of tunnels weve got
a hundred and twenty locomotives and
three thousand cars

 what do you mean by we the
ibpa

  sure we run em theyre just made
to order for us

  a train stopped and angelino with carey
and the guards climbed in one of the cars
fifteen minutes later they were at the en-
trance of another basement much like the
one from which they had started ange-
lino stepped into an elevator and motioned
carey to follow him

  you boys neednt come any further he
said to the guards

  when the elevator started carey was sur-

prised to find they were descending instead
of going up

  there seems to be a lot of chicago i
 dont know anything about he said

  youve got plenty of company were
 pretty careful who gets a chance to see what
 im going to show you

  the elevator stopped and angelino opened
 a door into a great underground warehouse
 a natural cavern asked carey

  no such luck we had to dig it some
 job eh

  i should say so

  wait till you see our laboratories and
 workshops

  are they down here asked carey

 	ten miles away

  i should think that would be inconven-
 ient for you

  not so bad ill show you how we get
 to them

  he led the way among the piles of freight
 there were great machines crated for ship-
 ment others were mounted on trucks evi-
 dently to be wheeled into position for use
 all kinds of goods were stacked nearly to
 the roof

 at the far end of the chamber were rail-
 road tracks leading into a tunnel ange-
 lino telephoned and a few minutes later an
 electric locomotive slid up to the platform
 where are we going carey asked
 spring river ever been there

  i dont believe so

  its a little town ten miles from the
 loop it had a famous brewery once
 now the brewerys the biggest ginger ale
 works in the country angelino looked at
 carey quizzically

  you mean youre using the old brewery
 buildings for your laboratories and work-
 shops

  thats it were making plenty of dough
 out of the ginger ale racket and it covers
 up our real activities

  mighty clever conceded carey does
 this subway run all the way

  sure lands you in the sub-basement
 of the main building

  you do things on a big scale dont you
 -digging a subway ten miles long and
 things like that


wonder stories

  angelino became serious you dont
realize yet carey that the ibpa is really
a great revolutionary organization the
racketeering part was for two purposes-to
get funds and to conceal our real objects
weve fooled everybody with the help of
the newspapers weve fooled em so well
that even you dont believe the truth now
when i tell you

  well there havent been any revolu-
tions for so long that they seem a little
old-fashioned i doubt whether you can get
away with it

  mussolini got away with it in italy
didnt he were ten times as powerful
as he was when he started and we have
weapons the world has never even imag-
ined

carey plots

carey shook his head doubtfully
maybe youre right but nineteen-
forty isnt nineteen-twenty and the united
states isnt italy when mussolini got
possession of rome italy belonged to the
fascists you might control washington
and new york and chicago and you
wouldnt have made a dent in america
dont worry about that its all ar-
ranged well take possession of every city
in the country on the morning of septem-
ber third see im so sure of our success
that im telling you our plans

  not much danger of my giving them
away if youre going to keep me out there
i spring river

  only until september third professor
after that you can live in your own house
again if you want to

  whats the idea of this revolution of
yours anyway youre making all the
money there is and you have plenty of
power now

  angelino frowned money isnt every-
thing look at me professor who do i
look like

  carey gazed at him steadily for a mo-
ment you look a good deal like some of
the pictures of napoleon

angelino nodded in satisfaction do

you happen to believe in reincarnation pro-
fessor

  i cant say i do

  suppose i was the reincarnation of nap-
oleon and was destined to conquer the
world

  do you believe that asked carey
angelino shrugged his shoulders without
replying as the train came to a stop

	 

  carey was seated with angelino in the
elaborately equipped office of the ginger ale
works

  well what do you think of the ibpa
now asked angelino

what can i think you have the finest
laboratories and workshops ive ever seen
how about our fighting machines

  i cant tell much about them till i see
them work

  you saw one of them stop the engines
of your plane yesterday all we have to
do is start it and the ignition system of every
internal combustion engine within a radius
of twenty miles quits cold

  the government knows youve got that
one said carey adams described it to
me he spoke about the detonating ray
machines so the government knows about
them too i dont see how the machines
are going to do you much good with the
government prepared for them youre go-
ing to have heavy odds against you

  ah but theres a third machine which
the government doesnt know about with
it we can absolutely destroy any body of
men or place that resists us the boys call
it the devil feeder

  what does it do asked carey cur-
iously

  angelino shook his head were not
telling about that one till after september
third

  suppose the government discovers that
this place is your headquarters they
could destroy your machines before you
had a chance to use them

  not a chance declared angelino con-
fidently unless they had your ether wave
generator he looked at his watch ill
have to leave you youll sleep in my
apartment on the top floor of the main
the return of the cosmic gun



building come up and ill introduce you
to a couple of the boys wholl keep you
company

  the apartment was luxuriously furnished
a negro cook had dinner ready when the
two men stepped out of the automatic ele-
vator angelino introduced carey to jim
and ziggsy who appeared to be typical
gorillas

  the boys will take good care of you
professor he said ill see you in the
morning

  jim and ziggsy were not inclined to talk
and dinner was eaten in silence after they
had finished carey read a couple of chi-
cago newspapers while the gorillas played
pinochle finally carey said i guess ill
go to bed if youll show me where i sleep

  sure said ziggsy the boss said you
wafc to have his room right through this
door

  where are you going to sleep asked
carey

  us we aint goin to bed till the boss
gets back

angelinos bedroom was separated
from the living room by a hall which
ran through the middle of the suite its
four windows were unbarred but a glance
showed there was no way of reaching the
ground carey undressed and put out the
light if anyone looked into the room he
was in bed apparently asleep in reality
he was wide awake and paying close atten-
tion to the time shown on the illuminated
dial of his wrist watch

  at five minutes to eleven he got up and
softly opened the bedroom door there
was still a light in the living room he
examined his door it had a lock but the
key was missing he carefully closed it
and propped a chair under the knob then
he took from an inside pocket in his coat
an oblong leather-covered case about the
size of a pocket camera

  he stood this case upright on a small
table beside the bed from the top he drew
two rods which connected by a wire to
form a miniature aerial he lowered the
front of the case and took out a tiny tele-
phone receiver now he glanced at his

watch again and saw the hands stood exactly
at eleven he threw a switch and called
softly hello

  a voice instantly answered hello
   that you mike asked carey

  its me ive been waiting at the lab-
oratory you all right professor

  im all right i dont know how long
ill be able to talk to you youd better
write down what i tell you

   k professor 

  got your pencil and paper

  ive got em

  as soon as i finish talking i want you
to hunt up william adams hes probably
on board caleb paxtons yacht the wild
goose at the chicago yacht club if he
isnt there find him understand

  im to hunt up william adams if he
isnt on mr caleb paxtons yacht the wild
gooser ive got to find him anyway
thats right now when you see adams
tell him im at the headquarters of the
ibpa theyre in the old brewery at
spring river which is now used as a ginger
ale plant the main building has a flat
roof im in an apartment at the north-
west corner of the top story got all that
down

  yes sir

  tell adams i have information of the
greatest importance which must reach
washington immediately what i want
him to do is to have one of the diesel-mot-
ored army autogiros land on the brewery
roof just about dark tomorrow night dont
forget it must have diesel motors adams
will understand why theres a trap door
to the roof from a closet in the bedroom
where i sleep if everything goes right ill
be on the roof when the autogiro lands
got ail that

  ive got it

  tell adams to have the pilot fly over
spring river before dark so hell know
what hes doing he cant miss the brew-
ery its the only big building in town
after he locates it hell have to go away
and fly back say at eight oclock i wont
be able to make it before that time even if
everything goes right there ought to be
enough light at eight oclock for him to see


wonder stories

to land on the roof the building is red
brick and its about two blocks long hell
have to be careful to dodge the smoke stacks
theyre at the south end got all that
down mike

  yes professor

  now read it over to yourself and see if
theres anything you dont understand if
there is ask me now because i wont-talk
to you again unless something interferes
with the plans for tomorrow night by the
way tell adams the message is from henry
so hell know it isnt one of angelinos
tricks

  hello professor said mike five min-
utes later theres one thing you didnt
tell me suppose i cant find mr adams
in time

  you start off now mike and hunt for
him if you dont locate him by noon to-
morrow give the message to caleb pax-
ton

chapter v

the war conference

the following morning the wild goose
was leisurely steaming north on lake
michigan below in the cabin was a wor-
ried looking group of men who had come
aboard one by one the night before while
the yacht was anchored off the chicago
yacht club adams was speaking

  i didnt care to assume the responsibility
of not bringing you gentlemen together in
view of the seriousness of the situation
when we planned the campaign against the
ibpa it seemed best that no meeting such
as this be held however the happenings
of the past few days indicate that a policy
of delay and inaction would be far more
dangerous than meeting the situation bold-
ly

  jarvis the president of the dearborn
national bank rose to his feet he looked
around the table slowly and then spoke
of course we all know one another but
this is our first knowledge that we are as-
sociated in a war on the greatest menace
that has ever threatened america i con-
gratulate you gentlemen in having the

courage to fight a most dangerous enemy

  im sure we are all satisfied that mr
adams did the proper thing in bringing us
together in spite of whatever risk it en-
tailed im glad you gentlemen are no
longer numbers to me i think we can
trust one another im glad to have you
know me as seymour jarvis instead of
number seven

  there was a scattered burst of applause
peabody the chairman of the board of con-
solidated gas tapped irritably on the table
with his gold pencil

  what are these serious happenings of
the past few days that adams talks about
he wanted to know he hasnt told us
anything that we didnt know before i
for one object to being kept in the dark
you wont be kept in the dark mr pea-
body said adams ive been waiting
hoping to have certain additional informa-
tion to lay before you you all know of
the accident to the plane in which professor
carey and i were on our way from wash-
ington

  the men around the table nodded

  most of you dont know that the sup-
posed accident was a deliberate attempt on
the part of the ibpa to kill carey adams
related the events which followed the forced
landing including the interview with an-
gelino it means he concluded sub-
mission to gangster rule or war our only
chance is to take the ibpa by surprise
and destroy it before it starts its revolution
we havent much time

  he sat down there was a moments sil-
ence as the men looked at one another un-
certainly

  do you think the ibpa has any know-
ledge of our plans asked jarvis

  adams laughed grimly if it had none
of you would be here this afternoon youd
be in a better world playing harps may-
be

  id sure like to know of this machine of
professor careys said jarvis

  so would i interjected peabody
where is carey

professor carey is making a very dan-
gerous attempt to locate the headquarters
the return of the cosmic gun



of the ibpa i told him it was almost sure
death but he-

  adams was interrupted by a knock at the
cabin door paxton strode over and un-
locked it captain baldwin was standing
outside

  what is it asked paxton testily
theres a man in a speedboat just over-
hauled us said the captain he says hes
got to see mr adams i thought id better
tell you

  whats that paxton frowned are
you sure he asked for adams

  thats what he said he said it was a
matter of life and death

paxton turned to adams what do
you make of it bill how could any-
body find out you were aboard

search me what kind of looking fel-
low is he captain look like a reporter
captain baldwin shook his head too
old id say hes got a beard i never
saw a reporter with a beard

  i dont think we ought to let anyone see
us interrupted jarvis it might make
them suspicious

  sure said adams if they saw this
bunch gathered together theyd suspect you
were getting ready to buy control of u s
steel or standard oil

  i guess jarvis is right though bill said
paxton its betterto be careful

  adams turned to captain baldwin this
fellow just said he wanted to see me he
didnt say anything else

  he said he had a message from henry
i believe

  whats that exclaimed paxton and
adams together

captain baldwin looked surprised he
said he had a message from henry or hen-
ry had sent him-something like that
lie to ordered paxton and let him
come aboard

  whats it all about asked peabody
querulously after captain baldwin had
hurried away whos henry

  professor henry carey it probably
means he has succeeded

  more likely to be a trick of the ibpa

growled jarvis angelinos after you
adams you better not let that fellow
aboard

  thats all right jarvis said paxton
we can manage him whoever he is we
wont bring him here you keep the cabin
door closed and adams and i will see him
in my stateroom forward he wont even
know any of you are aboard

  well its up to you jarvis grumbled
but i think youre running a needless
risk

  the newcomer was a serious-looking man
of about fifty

  you mr adams he asked

  thats my name what do you want
  i got to see you private

  you can say anything you want to be-
fore mr paxton hes the owner of the
wild goose

  the man gazed keenly at paxton then
he nodded my names kelly he began
im professor careys assistant in the lab-
oratory i make all of his apparatus for
him

 where is carey now demanded
adams youve heard from him

  kelly nodded eleven oclock last
night i been hunting for you ever since
what did he say

  he said to tell you he was at headquar-
ters of the ibpa

  how did he get the message to you
asked adams suspiciously

-rhes got a micro-wireless telephone with
him

  whats that asked paxton

  its a wireless phone that works on a
short wave length less than two inches
the sets so small you can carry it in your
pocket its only good about thirty miles
thats something new to me said
adams

  its pretty new kelly admitted pro-
fessor carey invented it there aint many
been made yet

  what did carey say demanded adams
lets have it

  kelly took a paper from his pocket he
had me write it all down so there wouldnt
be no mistakes


wonder stories

for the strong

carey slept soundly and woke about
seven oclock he found angelino
eating breakfast alone he looked around
for the gorillas but they had disappeared

  where are my two friends this morn-
ing he asked

  oh them replied angelino indifferent-
ly you wont need em during the day
while youre working in the laboratory
he gazed at carey keenly i dont know
that you need them anyway give me your
word you wont try to leave here until after
the third and you wont see them again
carey laughed better not trust me
angelino i might be fooling you

  angelino frowning in thought paid no
attention to the remark as soon as you
finish breakfast well go down to the shops
and get the men started on your ether wave
generator how long will it take to com-
plete one

  it depends on the kind of workmen you
have and how soon you can get the mater-
ials we need of course- ill have to make
a new set of drawings

  wheres the set you used making the
first machine

  in the war department at washington
thats the only set in existence there
was only one set of blueprints made from
the tracings these were each sent to a
different manufacturer so no one would
learn too much about the machine

  they got the blueprints now

  carey shook his head they were re-
turned to the war department

 what happened to the machine you
built you couldnt take that to washing-
ton with you

  the government took possession of it
last week thats all i know

  dont you know where it is now ask-
ed angelino suspiciously

  not any more than you do last week
a couple of secret service men came to the
laboratory with a bunch of workmen and
trucks they said they had orders from
washington to take the machine to the great
lakes naval station

  what did you do

  what could i do i dismantled it so
they could get it up the stairs from the
basement they loaded it on the trucks
and took it away the next day i was
ordered to go to washington and take all
the plans of the generator with me

  what happened when you got to wash-
ington

  half a dozen engineers got me in a
room and questioned me for hours they
acted as if i were trying to put something
over on them i told them all i knew about
the theory and construction of the genera-
tor and gave them the plans

  was that all

  carey nodded they sent me back to
chicago by plane and some of your gorillas
tried to keep me from getting there

  it looks to me as if you got a raw deal
said angelino thoughtfully

  its a good thing perhaps if i hadnt
been sore i wouldnt have taken your propo-
sition

  well youll have a chance to get back
at the washington bunch

	 

  carey was able to satisfy himself about a
matter that had puzzled him the day before
to invent and build the machines he had
seen would he knew take a scientific and
engineering staff of extraordinary skill a
long period of time men capable of such
achievements have at least a national repu-
tation and their activities are well known
now carey met these mysterious scientists
he found them rather taciturn men who
had been trained at the best technical
schools aboard and of whom he had never
heard

  how do they live when theyre not work-
ing carey asked angelino you cant
keep them locked up as you do me

  they live in spring river all the em-
ployees of the ginger ale plant live there
i should think youd be afraid some of
them might talk

  theyre not thetalking kind most of
them have been in trouble in their own
countries we got them away and brought
them here they all share in the profits
of the ibpa theyll all be part of the

  carey looked at angelino in frank won-
der im blessed if i understand how you
hold your gang together you started out
as a racketeer whatever you are now most
people still regard you as a gangster
theyd laugh at the idea of your being a
revolutionist yet even taking you at your
own valuation youre going to set up a dic-
tatorship these followers of yours strike
me as being communists i suppose you
might be called a fascist you ought to be
fighting on opposite sides

  angelino waved the objection aside
mussolini stalin hitler me-were all
working for the same end government by
the strong for the benefit of the strong the
little men the workers we take care of of
course its to our advantage to do that
these little men will be better off after
september third than they are now

an autogiro to the rescue

carey got to work at a drawing board
and apparently made rapid progress
angelino visited him a number of times dur-
ing the day when evening came he accom-
panied carey to the apartment on the top
floor and turned him over to jim and ziggsy
who were waiting there

  ive got to be away tonight said an-
gelino half apologetically and some of the
boys will be better satisfied if jim and zigg-
sy stay with you

  thats all right said carey they
wont bother me glad to have them
the three men were eating dinner when
carey heard the sound of a plane overhead
he glanced at his watch and saw it was
seven-thirty

  he hurried through the rest of the meal
and started to leave the table ziggsy who
had been drinking caught hold of his arm

  you dont wanta go to bed yet perfes-
sor lets have a little game of some kind
im afraid i dont know any games re-
plied carey

  well teach you some wont we jim
ivell teach the perfessor to play poker

  im tired carey objected had a hard
day i think i wont play

  say perfessor you went to bed before
eight oclock last night and here youre
goin to do it again tonight that aint no
way for a white man to act when hes with
his friends were friends aint we per-
fessor

  carey nodded he was listening anxious-
ly for the plane it would descend vertical-
ly with the engine cut off but landing on
the roof would make some noise he won-
dered desperately how he could get away
he was unarmed and though ziggsy and
jim had removed their shoulder holsters
with their coats the automatics were with-
in easy reach he suspected he wouldnt
have much chance in a rough and tumble
fight

  suddenly there was a crash on the roof
followed by a shout from the ground

  what the hell exclaimed ziggsy
rushing toward the window followed by
jim taking advantage of the opportunity
carey leaped for the guns in the holsters
hanging over the back of the chairs the men
had left

  whats the trouble jim shouted out
of the window ziggsy glanced around to
speak to carey and saw him a gun in each
hand retreating toward the hall

  ziggsys startled oath drew jims atten-
tion from the window stay where you
are snapped carey i dont want to
shoot either of you unless i have to

  they gazed at him in open-mouthed as-
tonishment keep your fingers away from
them triggers perfessor begged ziggsy
them guns shoots awful easy

  you do as i tell you said carey and
you wont get hurt

  whats the use of actin this way ask-
ed jim you couldnt get away from
spring river if you had fifty guns youll
only get us in bad without doin yourself
no good

  you two boys stay here carey order-
ed im going into the bedroom if you
try to follow me itll be just too bad

escape

he backed slowly through the door and
slammed it after him he ran across
the hall into the bedroom where he dragged
the heavy bureau against the door using
the back of a chair for a ladder he managed
to reach the bolt which fastened the trap
door in the closet ceiling it stuck at first
but finally yielded he heard voices in the
living room and realized the gorillas were
calling out of a window to someone on the
ground

  he swung himself up and sat precarious-
ly on the closet shelf bracing his feet
against the opposite wall he pushed the
trap door open now all he had to do was
pull himself through the opening to the
roof as he reached up to grasp the ledge
there was a sudden commotion in the hall
and he heard the bureau being forced away
from the door

 where is the--- a voice shout-
ed

  he braced himself again on the shelf and
waited pistol in hand the closet door was
flung open and two men looked up at him
come on boys shouted one of them
weve got the skunk

  deliberately carey pressed the trigger
the roar in the confined space deafened him
and a stream of bullets tore downward the
faces below disappeared he glanced up-
ward and saw a man looking through the
trap door as he reached for the ledge
again his hands were grasped and he was
dragged out on the roof

  carey recognized adams voice and in
the darkness he could vaguely distinguish
three men they rushed him toward the au-
togiro as the beam of a searchlight began
to explore the sky

  looks as if we were going to get away
easily said adams as the plane glided into
the air a second later the searchlight pick-
ed them up

  think theyll fire on us asked a man
in uniform whom carey did not know

  i dont believe so he answered they
will count on stopping our motor they

have a ray machine he went on to explain
which can put the ignition system of any
internal combustion engine out of commis-
sion they havent found out yet that we
have a diesel motor which doesnt use an
ignition system

  i guess theyve found it out now said
adams looking down at a flying field
which suddenly sprang into view as flood
lights were turned on yes theyve found
out all right theres a couple of planes
starting up after us

  the pilot laughed they aint got a
chance in a million of catching us or hitting
us either we should be landing in about
ten minutes

  late that night an army plane left chi-
cago for washington with carey and adams
as passengers early the next morning they
appeared at a hastily summoned meeting
of the presidents cabinet carey related
what he had learned from angelino and
from observation of the ibpa headquarters
officials of the army navy and justice de-
partments were instructed to check up im-
mediately on the information

  a few hours later reports confirming all
carey had told the president and the cabinet
began trickling in the authorities were
astounded at the extent of the conspiracy
the ibpa had added to its numbers thou-
sands of men who regarded it as similar
to the fascist organizations of several euro-
pean countries a large proportion of these
adherents were undoubtedly sincere in their
belief that a change in the form of govern-
ment would be beneficial and had entirely
lost sight of the criminal history of the
ibpa

the night of august twenty-eighth
there was little sleep in any of the
government departments already what
amounted to martial law was in force
though no announcement to that effect was
made all means of communication were
quietly taken over secret service men ar-
rested travelers who could not give satis-
factory account of themselves troop move-
ments on an extensive scale began that night

  early in the morning of the twenty-ninth
carey and adams left for chicago a gov-
the return of the cosmic gun



ernment plane landed them at the great
lakes naval station where they met col-
onel herrington who was in charge of the
coordinated forces in the chicago area

  angelino had told carey that the revolu-
tion was to start on september third there
was a bare chancethat on account of the
escape of carey an attempt would be made
to advance the date however it was con-
sidered unlikely by the war department
that the elaborate plans of the ibpa could
be readily changed

  the general staff decided that the gov-
ernment should strike first an attack on
the conspirators would be made simultane-
ously all over the country in chicago it
would start at one minute after midnight
central time september first in the east
one minute after one am eastern time
in denver one minute after eleven pm
august thirty-first mountain time in san
francisco one minute after ten pm paci-
fic time

  after reaching chicago carey spent for-
ty-eight hours in the basement of the ad-
ministration building at the naval station
with a staff of mechanics preparing the ether
wave generator for service he had little
time for sleep during the two days and he
was very tired as midnight of august thirty-
first approached he hurried to join the
grim-faced group of men gathered in the
central rotunda of the communications
building watching the large ground-glass
screen on which messages telling of the pro-
gress of the attack would appear as they
were sent from washington

  in the various corridors radiating from
the rotunda were the hundreds of operators
in the communications department befdre
their telephone switchboards telegraph in-
struments directional beam radio and tele-
visor instruments

  funny youre not getting something by
this time colonel said adams to colonel
herrington as he gazed at the blank screen

  were purposely not receiving anything
replied colonel herrington we discov-
ered that the ibpa had devised a very clever
way of tapping messages conveyed over
wires by a system of induction

  thats one thing they didnt discover

said a gray-haired naval officer the ger-
man submarines used to do that during the
war theyd lie on the bottom alongside a
cable and get every message going over
if

  well thats what those fellows have been
doing for years said colonel herrington
though we just found it out we decided
not to run any risk of warning them before
the attack begins he glanced at his watch
that will be ten minutes now it will be
too late after that to do them any good if
they do intercept our messages

war

there was tense silence in the room as
the hands of a synchronized clock on
the wall crept around toward midnight
suddenly a time signal sounded

  well the waiting is over anyhow said
colonel herrington well get some news
in a few minutes as he spoke printed
words began to travel across the screen

  washington  est trains every-
where in the u s are being held at stations
or stopped by signal within thirty minutes
there will not be a wheel turning in the
u s all highways have been closed by
u s troops	

  colonel herrington nodded in satisfac-
tion that means transportation is paral-
yzed already he said trains stopped
roads closed planes commandeered and
wirelfess communication jammed by inter-
ference on all wave lengths

  washington  est all known
gangsters and habitual criminals being
rounded up in all parts of the country as
yet there has been no serious resistance

  colonel herrington pressed a button
televisors he ordered city and sub-
urbs

  instantly there appeared on the screen
rapidly moving pictures troops were seen
entering houses and dragging out men a
group of men shackled together marching
between soldiers empty streets with de-
serted automobiles and street cars

  whats going on at spring river
asked carey

colonel harrington spoke into the square
g

wonder stories

box beside him a picture of the deserted
streets of a small town flitted across the
screen

  looks as if they were all in bed sug-
gested adams

  theyll be getting up soon enough said
colonel herrington troops are massed
solidly around the town and all roads reach-
ing it are guarded troops have taken
possession of the city freight subways and
the underground warehouses of the ibpa
i wonder what angelinos waiting for
said adams he must know whats hap-
pening by this time

  maybe hes getting ready the surprise
weapon he told carey he had-the devil
feeder im delaying the attack on spring
river until we find out if were up against
anything we havent prepared for

  if theyve turned on the detonating
ray machines they must be wondering why
nothings happened

  we made a thorough job of that said
colonel herrington there isnt any ex-
plosive of any kind within a hundred miles
of chicago not a soldier has a cartridge
on him

  have any trouble

  colonel herrington smiled rather grim-
ly it was a little difficult to get hold of
all the explosives in the possession of con-
tractors without giving any reason we
carted everything off without making ex-
planations and the owners were told to
keep their mouths shut some of them
didnt like it

  what about the soldiers- any trouble
with them

  colonel herringtons eyebrows went up
soldiers obey orders besides they rather
liked the idea of using bayonets

  well said carey it looks as if youd
spiked the two weapons angelino was de-
pending on the detonating rays are no
good without explosives to set off there
are no cars or planes running so they cant
paralyze ignition systems it leaves the
ibpa fairly helpless unless they really have
the secret weapon up their sleeves that an-
gelino claims they have

  colonel herrington pressed a button on
his desk

  televisors off he ordered

  the pictures faded from the screen and a
string of words flitted across it -no ser-
ious trouble except in new york chicago
new orleans and san francisco many
persons killed by explosions in some of
these cities presumably set off by detonat-
ing ray machines

colonel herrington frowned as
he read the message the ibpa un-
doubtedly has centers in other places like
the one in chicago he said but on a
smaller scale unfortunately the govern-
ment hasnt been able to locate them he
turned to carey wed have had a much
more serious job on our hands if it hadnt
been for you professor

  carey was looking thoughtful i dont
like the way things are going he said
were winning too easily

  dont worry about that replied colonel
herrington grimly the fights not over
yet

  a message appeared on the screen
 e s t in new york and new
orleans ignition systems of all internal
combustion engines have failed this ef-
fect is undoubtedly due to the ray machines
of the ibpa and was anticipated a suffi-
cient number of diesel motored cars trucks
and planes have been supplied all com-
mands

  a buzzer sounded on colonel herring-
tons desk he turned a switch and a voice
spoke from the box beside him some-
thing wrong in the freight tunnels sir we
cant get any of the communications men
any report from colonel weldon

  he reported five minutes ago that all
operations were proceeding as planned
see if you can get hold of him
colonel herrington turned to the listening
men we have three thousand troops oc-
cupying the sixty-five miles of the freight
tunnels he explained with communica-
tions men each half mile theyve been re-
porting every fifteen minutes by short wave
radio now we cant reach them it looks
bad

  whos colonel weldon asked adams
the return of the cosmic gun



  hes in command of the troops guarding
the loop

  colonel weldon calling commanding
officer came a voice from the box

  colonel herrington speaking whats
wrong in the tunnels

  theyre on fire the heat is so intense
we cant get near them

  what about the men

  they didnt have a chance to escape
one minute everything was all right the
next the tunnels were a solid mass of flame
damnation exclaimed colonel her-
rington what started it what is there
in the tunnels to burn

  i dont know nothing i should think
im reporting what happened flames from
the subway entrances have set a number of
the loop buildings on fire theres going
to be a conflagration if we dont do some-
thing pretty quick

  use your own judgment see that your
men arent trapped the way the poor devils
in the tunnels were

        chapter vii
        devil feeders

colonel herrington turned to
carey you heard what he said no
use ordering the fire department out none
of the motor apparatus would run whats
burning in those tunnels carey you
know more about it than anybody else
i dont know anything replied carey
but i can guess its the devil-feeders
angelino told me he had

  what do you suppose they are some-
thing like the flame projectors they used in
the war

  carey shook his head theyd be pretty
nearly as dangerous to the men using them
as to the enemy in a confined space like the
tunnels no this is something a lot-more
serious i imagine were up against an-
other invention of the ibpa scientists-pro-
bably some kind of ray which heats to
incandescence any object it touches

  colonel herringtons face was grim if
angelino has a weapon like that he can
turn it on our men anywhere and burn them

up just as he did those in the tunnels
cant he

  exactly the only way we can stop him
as far as i can see is to attack him from
the rear

  thats going to cost a lot of men it
looks to me as if he could hold off the whole
united states army

  there are ways of getting at him said
carey

  well have to use your generator her-
rington said

  carey stared at him youre suggesting
we use it here in the city

  naturally thats where the fighting
is

  what about the people who live here
what about the women and children and
old people he shook his head i
wont take a chance on using the generator
except at spring river as i agreed
suppose i order you to use it in the
loop

  im sorry but it wont make any differ-
ence if i did that all of downtown chi-
cago and us with it might disappear like
a soap bubble when it bursts

  colonel herrington flushed angrily
whats the use of having a weapon youre
afraid to use

  it isnt a question of being afraid we
simply dont know what the effect of a
machine this size will be the little experi-
mental one in the fraction of a second stop-
ped all visible motion the big one will
probably destroy matter by stopping atomic
motion ill risk using it to attack the ibpa
headquarters at spring river the way
angelino has the place protected we cant
attack it any other way i wont risk using
the generator in a city where there are
millions of people

  what do you suggest doing then ask-
ed colonel herrington less truculently
the-gangsters have possession of what is
practically an underground city they can
come to the surface when they want to and
well be helpless you said yourself there
was nothing to stop them from destroying
the troops with their heat rays

  theres one thing we can do said carey
we can turn the chicago river into the


wonder stories

underground city and drown them like rats

  colonel herrington snorted how are
we going to do it even if we knew where
to blast a channel we couldnt use explo-
sives the detonating rays would set them
off before we could put them in position

  did you ever hear of the hartridge cos-
mic gun asked carey

  hartridge repeated colonel herrington
wasnt he the man who was murdered by
somebody who turned his own machine on
him

  carey nodded he invented a machine
which concentrated what are known as the
cosmic rays coming from outer space it
was practically a gun which destroyed
everything in its path the biggest mach-
ine hartridge built would carve a tunnel six
feet in diameter through a mountain in a
few seconds

  what good does that do us now de-
manded colonel herrington

  a dr goodrich spent ten years after the
murder rediscovering hartridges secrets
there are now about twenty of these mach-
ines in the united states one of them is
here in chicago

colonel herrington frowned
how could it be in chicago without
my knowing it whos responsible for
it

  i havent the faintest idea the govern-
ment doesnt publish secrets of that kind

i	suggest you get in touch with washington
tell them what the situation is here and
tell them you must have the hartridge cos-
mic gun

  colonel herrington after a moments hesi-
tation strode from the room the others
stayed to watch the messages flitting across
the screen except in a few of the larger
cities the situation seemed to be well under
control

  the ibpa had apparently been taken by
surprise in new york washington and
st louis troops had occupied the head-
quarters and workshops of the organization
without a struggle large stores of arms
and explosives had been found in each of
these places as well as intricate machines
the uses of which were unknown

  the leaders of the organization remained
silent when arrested but their followers
ttlked freely papers found at the various
headquarters involved numerous business
men and capitalists who had been fright-
ened by paternalistic ventures of the gov-
ernment and saw a chance to establish a
reactionary dictatorship these men were
being arrested as rapidly as they could be
rounded up the authorities in washing-
ton announced that all such individuals
actually involved in the conspiracy would
be tried for treason

  martial law covering the entire country
was declared at two a m eastern standard
time instructions were despatched to all
military commanders that persons arrested
in the conspiracy be tried immediately by
courts martial and if convicted summarily
executed

the hartridge cosmic gun

the hartridge cosmic gun was in a
secretly constructed hermetically sealed
chamber beneath the administration build-
ing at the naval station after colonel
herrington had obtained all the information
that the general staff in washington could
give him it required nearly an hour to reach
it every precaution had been taken to keep
the machine from being tampered with
because of the disintegrating effect of the
cosmic rays it was next to careys ether
wave generator the most destructive mech-
anism in the world and even more dangerous
to handle than the generator

  when the door to the sealed under-
ground chamber were opened the machine
did not look particularly impressive to the
htlf dozen men who gazed at it it was
rather like a group of searchlights mounted
or a wheeled platform carey examined it
carefully comparing the operating levers
with a diagram he held in his hand

  think you can use it asked colonel
herrington

  carey nodded i think so well have
to take a chance anyhow be careful when
we wheel it into the elevator that no one
touches these levers theyre set at neutral
now
the return of the cosmic gun



  the elevator which ran to the level of the
secret chamber was hydraulic and was not
affected by the ibpa ray machines wait-
ing at the loading platform in the basement
of the administration building was a diesel
motored truck the cosmic gun was care-
fully loaded on this truck which then pro-
ceeded in the direction of the loop

  carey selected a spot on the north bank
of the chicago river just beyond the state
street bridge to begin operations

  you fellows better get back a block or
two he said to adams colonel herrington
and a group of officers who had accompan-
ied the truck i think i know how to
operate the gun but something unexpected
might happen

  i guess ill stay said adams

  were staying too said colonel her-
rington if the job isnt too dangerous
for a college professor and a newspaper
man the army can take a chance you
might tell us what youre going to do so
well know what to expect

  i suppose you know what the cosmic
rays are carey asked without waiting
for a reply he continued they are very
short rays coming from some unknown
source in outer space they are incom-
parably more powerful than any other rays
known penetrating fifty feet of water or
nine feet of lead hartridge discovered a
substance which reflected them just as a
mirror reflects sunlight

  by making lenses of this substance it is
possible to concentrate the rays that is
what all these things that look like search-
lights are for the beam resulting is so
powerful that it cuts through rock just as a
blow torch would cut through a snowbank
the machine can be made of any size and
power this particular one will cut a tun-
nel six feet in diameter an indefinite dis-
tance through the earth-hundreds of miles
probably

  what starts it going asked adams
this lever here answered carey re-
flects the rays which reach the earth verti-
cally to any direction desired if i turn it
ninety degrees the rays will be directed
horizontally i want them to carve a tunnel
from this river into the underground maze

of passages and chambers below the loop
which are now in the hands of the ibpa

il	i pull the lever say a hundred and ten
degrees the rays will be deflected slightly
downward they will strike the water
about the middle of the river penetrate the
bank and thence across the city

  you say theyll make a tunnel six feet
in diameter asked colonel herrington
then the river will rush through this tunnel
and flood underground chicago

  thats my idea acknowledged carey
the iirst tunnel we make may not reach
all underground passages but it will des-
troy all water tunnels and sewers in its
path if everything turns out as we expect
well make five or six more at various
points im going to move the direction
lever now but nothing will happen he
grasped a handle and pulled it toward him
nothing happens because all ive done is
change the direction of the rays now ill
move the focussing lever better protect
your faces when the concentrated rays
strike the water i think it will be vaporized
i dont know what the exact effect will be
here goes

there was a flash of violet light envel-
oping the gun and then the river seem-
ed to explode with a roar that was heard
blocks away from the machine a cylinder
of incandescence six feet in diameter pene-
tiated the river at a slight angle to the sur-
face and reaching the bank extended itself
in a glowing tunnel through the earth

  the watchers had started back as great
clouds of steam turning to clouds of white
vapor billowed toward the sky the waters
surrounding the cylinder of radiant light
as if it were a tube of some material sub-
stance were in violent agitation

  suddenly carey reversed the lever and
the violet glow faded as the cylinder of
incandescence was cut off the darkness
after the brilliant light and the clouds of
steam still rising made it impossible for the
waiting men to see exactly what results had
been attained

  swing the searchlight around carey
called to the driver of the truck on which


wonder stories

the gun was mounted point it over at
the opposite bank

  the light showed the water rushing into
what looked like the mouth of an immense
sewer

  well i guess that does it said colonel
herrington thatll drown out the rats

  carey shook his head wed better make
half a dozen more to be on the safe side

  they noticed the glare in the west after
they had finished the fourth tunnel col-
onel herrington watched it with frowning
face as it spread against the sky

  ill have to get back to headquarters
he said to carey you bring the gun back
as soon as you finish the next tunnel

  a messenger in a rocket car met carey
and adams as they were starting back to the
naval station a half hour later the glow
in the sky had become a lurid glare of
mounting flames and billowing clouds of
smoke

  the whole west sides on fire said the
messenger the colonel wants you in a
hurry

  colonel herrington was pacing up and
down the rotunda of the communications
building watching the televisor pictures of
the conflagration appearing on the screen

  thats angelinos revenge he ex-
claimed he knows now hes whipped and
hes going to destroy the city

  what happened asked carey gazing
at the rapidly changing pictures which
were largely obscured by great clouds of
smoke

  it began when we put the first tunnel
through i imagine said colonel herring-
ton i told you we had troops surround-
ing spring river waiting developments
i figured youd have to use your wave gen-
erator out there and i didnt want to sacri-
fice men unnecessarily they were sacri-
ficed all right he added grimly

  the heat ray machine asked carey

  colonel herrington nodded wed kept
the troops some distance away from the
brewery buildings we knew that was the
danger spot the ibpa must have had the
heat ray machines stationed in a circle
around the town not many of the sol-
diers got away and those who did werent

stationed close enough to get a very clear
idea of what happened

  what kind of stories do they tell

  its hard to make sense of them ap-
parently the devil feeders can swing
around like a searchlight the rays were
invisible but everything in their path shriv-
eled up or burst into flame the men who
escaped took shelter in holes or under banks
while the rays passed over them

how about the people living out there
god knows spring river is destroyed
of course the people on the west side
had a little warning the fire seemed to
advance in waves

  advanced in waves did it said carey
thoughtfully thats curious

  my god man dont stand there talking
about it the city is burning up do
something 

  all right im willing to use the ether
wave generator now

the ether wave generator

fifteen minutes later a weird looking
machine slowly and ponderously start-
ed up the incline from the basement of the
communications building to the street
the motive power was a five ton diesel-mot-
ored truck and it drew a semi-trailer thirty
feet long and ten feet wide rated at forty
tons capacity this trailer had a six foot
high wall of armor plate around it pro-
tecting an intricate mass of machinery and
the dozen men who operated it

  this machinery was a nightmare of fans
pumps and turbines culminating in two
enormous cylinders of some shining metal
which rose from the rear of the truck these
cylinders narrowed at the top and were in-
clined toward each other exactly like the
two tubes of an oxy-acetylene torch be-
tween the cylinders and slightly in the rear
carey was seated before a series of levers
and dials which looked rather like those of
a very elaborate one-man-control motor
boat

  colonel herrington stood beside him
looking dubiously at the massive blow-pipe
arrangement

  thats what does the damage he asked
th return of the cosmic gun



  thats it replied carey the prin-
ciple isnt difficult to understand light
electricity magnetism rays of all kinds
are vibrations of the ether just as sound is a
vibration of the air what this machine
does is set up artificial waves in the ether
which are so much more powerful than any
produced naturally that the natural ones
are destroyed

  whats going to happen when you turn
it on will it destroy those heat ray mach-
ines and put out the fire

  im afraid its going to do more than
that im afraid everything the waves come
in contact with will just disappear as if
they had never existed

  if the waves destroy everything they
touch asked the colonel why dont they
destroy the machine itself when you produce
them

  they would if we produced them in the
machine see how the orifices of those two
big cylinders up there are inclined toward
each other remember the ether is mater-
ial even if we cant see it or feel it it is
set in motion in those two cylinders in such
a way that when the two streams meet up
there they join to form the destructive
waves which project themselves forward in
a straight line

  im afraid its too complicated for me
said colonel herrington all i hope is
that it works the way you think it will
oh yes carey said that part was
all a matter of mathematical calculation
after we had produced the ether waves arti-
ficially

 the truck was now moving slowly
through west side streets crowded with
hysterical men women and children flee-
ing from the conflagration with whatever
belongings they could carry some had
toy express wagons loaded with bedding
there was an occasional push cart piled
high with furniture or carrying someone
too ill or old to walk people had grown
to depend on automobiles to such an extent
that without them they were almost help-
less

  the advancing flames formed a fiery
wall against the western sky and were ac-
companied by a terror-inspiring roar great

burning fragments of building sailed
through the air setting fires ahead of the
main conflagration

  how much farther are you going before
you start the generator asked colonel
herrington

  as far as we can go with reasonable
safety remember everything ahead of us
will be destroyed-wiped out you dont
expect me to turn it on these women and
children do you

  of course not but dont run the risk of
being caught by the flames yourself you
have to turn the truck around to work the
generator dont you

carey shook his head this whole
platform on which the machinery rests
turns through a hundred and eighty degrees
like the turret of a battleship

  look out yelled colonel herrington
dodging a flaming brand which narrowly
missed his head

  perspiration was streaming from the faces
of all the meiron the truck as solid waves
of heat bore down on them the wall of
flame now seemed to curl above their heads
in an arch extending across the sky while
clouds of acrid smoke strangled them

  swing around into the first wide street
carey shouted to the driver who waved the
arm with which he was trying to protect his
face from the flying brands a moment
later he turned down a cross street which
opened into garfield park the line of the
advancing fire was only a few hundred
yards ahead and even the stragglers had
disappeared

  carey pulled a lever and the platform of
the trailer began slowly to turn until the
wave projector was pointed at the center
of the conflagration

  he smiled grimly at colonel herrington
youre going to see now something no
one has ever seen before but im not sure
youll be alive to remember it long he
glanced around at the men everything
ready he called

  all o k they responded

  then here goes

  he took a key from his pocket and un-
locked what looked like an automatic steer-


wonder stories

ing wheel this he turned slowly to the
left while the watchers fixed their eyes on
the juncture of the two nozzles at the top
of the cylinders

  after it was over adams reverted to
character as a ijewspaper man and gathered
the impressions of all who shared in the
experience they agreed that their first
sensation was one of hearing there was
a sudden shrill whistling sound instantly
increasing to a roar which drowned out the
sound of the flames carey explained this
as being due to the rush of air into the
vacuum created by the ether waves which
destroyed the air in their path as they did
all other matter

  the next sensation following immediately
was one of sight a few inches beyond the
juncture of the nozzles there occurred a
phenomenon which no one was able to des-
cribe very clearly it was like a terrifi-
cally rapid pulsation or vibration of a
ghostly silvery radiance the spectators
seemed to feel it as much as they saw it and
it lasted only a few seconds if it actually
occurred half of the men were doubtful
about its reality they were unanimous in
their description of the opalescent milky
cloud which projected itself in a broad
spreading sheet from the nozzles toward the
area in flames

  carey was the only one of them who had
any idea of the lapse of time the others
estimated the period the wave generator was
in operation as being from ten minutes to
half an hour carey with his eyes fixed
on his wrist watch knew the interval was
fifteen seconds

  with the sudden cessation of the roaring
they found themselves deafened and had to
shout to make one another hear where
the fire had been raging the opalescent
cloud still persisted but was being rolled
into great billows by a furious wind which
suddenly rose in a few minutes began
the curious electrical phenomena which
have been described elsewhere followed by
a downpour of rain which drove the men
from the truck to the shelter of a deserted
house

  two hours later the storm ceased as sud-
denly as it had  begun the gray in the

east changed to pink and the sun rose on
what was probably the strangest scene that
civilized man had ever beheld as far as
the eye could see was nothing except a flat
level plain as smooth as a billiard table
not a house a tree or a blade of grass was
on it it was as if a great knife had sliced
a piece off the round side of the earth

it was found afterward that that was prac-
tifically what had occurred the waves
from the machine travelling in a straight
line disintegrated all matter with which
they came into contact levelling off the
curved surface of the earth and then pass-
ing out through the atmosphere into space

  the fact that science had discovered a
vay to unleash such a destructive power
distracted interest from the abortive revo-
lution which had occasioned its use

  the ibpa headquarters and workshops
disappeared with everything else in the de-
vastated region angelino and his follow-
ers were wiped out with the thousands of
innocent people who perished unques-
tionably many of the gangsters had died a
few hours before in the flooding of the
subways and underground chambers by the
chicago river

  with the death of angelino and the des-
truction of the chicago headquarters the
revolutionary movement would have col-
lapsed even if most of its surviving leaders
had not been imprisoned these leaders
and their followers with gangster records
were quietly and efficiently executed those
whose chief crime had been an attempt to
establish a strong and efficient government
on fascist principles were sentenced to short
terms of imprisonment

  only a few persons know what disposition
was made of the ether wave generator
there was strong newspaper demand that it
be destroyed for fear its secret might be
learned by some new angelino with an am-
bition to dominate the world all that the
public knows certainly is that it has disap-
peared

  colonel herrington is now in command
of the eighty-seventh division of the united
states army with headquarters in new or-
leans professor carey has returned to his

chair at the university of chicago but
spends most of his time in research adams
is the editor of the new york times

  the most important result of the abor-
tive revolution was the establishment of a
federal police force which has authority

with the abolition of corrupt politically

ized crime has disappeared life in large

he went on with his work upon the thing that had been george

george dixon

was struggling
wildly amidst a great

conflagration fire
burned his body blaz-
ed before his eyes roared in his ears for
hours and hours he struggled wondering
why he was not con-
sumed 

  and then he awaken-
ed to the recognition
ollris own bedroom
and the fact that he
had been dreaming

but that burning feel-
ing of his body did not
cease neither did the
bright flashes of light
before his eyes the
roaring in his ears
and these phenomena
were ten times strang-
er now than in a
dream his limbs
twitched convulsively
under the bed-clothes

 must be sick he
thought nerves a bit
frazzled lately over-
work perhaps but he
hated to admit that

couldnt give up work
now no not now

he rolled over and
groaned rotten feel-
ing feel better in the
morning most likely

had to had to watch
his little block he
was worried about it

it had been getting
smaller right along
and sort of crumbling

yes instead of grow-
ing it was shrinking
away and he couldnt
understand that -
couldnt see where it
disappeared 

  for an hour he toss-
ed uneasily on the bed although his bod-
ily discomfort was steadily growing it was

not that which occu-
pied his mind he was
worrying about his lit-
tle block down in the
laboratory if he could
make sure it was all right he might get
some sleep he threw back the covers
swung his feet to the
floor and stood up
uttering a low startled
cry he swayed dizzily
and leaned against the
wall for support

  something pretty
darned wrong he
said aloud his voice
sounded strange and
high-pitched in his
own ears he found
the light switch

  the journey- down
the stairs was long and
terrible he held fast
to the banisters taking
one step at a time or-
dinary muscular co-
ordination seemed to
have deserted him
each movement re-
quired an effort of will
he could not last long
having gained the foot
of the stairs he stag-
gered to the laboratory
door on the right
burst in and switched
on the light there
was a long moment of
complete silence then
he gave a hoarse cry

  the laboratory was
a large square room
with long windows on
two sides against the
walls were set lead-
topped tables littered
with tubes retorts and
various electrical de-
vices but it was to-
wards the center of the
room that george dixon stared wide-eyed
there on a small table under a bell-jar

death from the stars

 by the author of
 the avenging ray

the island of the giants

  tn this gripping story ive
  get a peek into a few of 
  the most profound mys- 
  teries of the universe many
  modern scientists say that
   life is a disease that at-
  tacks matter in its old age
  -that when matter cools
  and loses its primal energy
  only then is life possible

    life being a disease all
  forms of life feed on each
  other - we are all in a
  sense bacteria consuming
  each other in a fierce strug-
  gle for existence

   there are many hun-
 dreds of forms of life that
 we know of and whose
 properties we dimly sense
 but how about the infinity
 of possible forms of whose
 j properties we know noth-
 ing suppose we were ex-
 posed to such a thing
 would there be a gigantic
 struggle for existence the
 human race battling
 against a terrible unknown
 enemy

    mr hilliard has given us
  here no world shaking
  epic but a grim intense
  struggle against a deva-
  stating ravage the precise
  nature of the enemy is not
  made clear nor would it be
  clear to us were we to meet
  it but we can sense in it
  the infinite forces of the
  universe massed against
  puny man this story
  marks a new notch of
  achievement for mr hil-
  liard as a writer of stories
  about possible things - p

reposed a little heap of black dust noth-
ing more there was certainly nothing in
the exhibit to astonish or terrify an ordinary
observer

  yet george dixon was both astonished and
terrified for he knew that only yester-
day there had been under that jar a pretty
fair sized block composed of his life
force and now it was gone where

  things had to go somewhere he told him-
self the jar was sealed tightly to the glass
plate beneath yet there remained only
black dust-and george knew what that
was

  he laid his hand on the glass warm but
not hot his eyes wandered around the
room-then became fixed upon a grotesque
object on the window
ledge it was-or rather
had been-his geranium
plant but now the leaves
were a dead black as
he watched one of them
dropped off and crum-
bled to powder on the
floor

  george drew his hand
across his eyes some-
thing was happening -
something he could not
understand he must try
to think but itwas hard
to think his mind didnt
seem to work right -
kept wandering he wish-
ed julius were there jul-
ius would help him

he stared at the geranium plant even
the stalk was black it was crumbling
away-as his little block had crumbled but
that didnt make it any teasier no he
couldnt think if only julius 

  he remembered the things julius had said
when they had last talked together julius
had come to visit him-an unusual occur-
rence-saying that he was interested in a
proposed experiment george had mentioned
in a letter george had explained cautious-
ly his intention to explore for life in sub-
stances deposited on the earth from outside

  what is life julius had asked abrupt-

ly george remembered laughing julius
had a way of asking unanswerable questions
george had muttered something about as-
similation

  life is a disease-julius had a way
of asking unanswerable questions-and then
answering them

  disease george had exclaimed
exactly a disease or corruption which
afflicts the stagnant matter which is our
earth this planets matter is very low in
energy it is cooling-disintegrating and
you and i are the crawling writhing mag-
gots of its decay

  horrible and preposterous

  horrible perhaps-but not preposterous
we say that life cannot exist upon the sun

why because the sun
is too hot for it what
does that mean mere-
ly that the sun has the
protective energy to
purge or sterilize itself of
such life as we repre-
sent place a needle point
in the flame-as the doc-
tor uses daily there you
have the same sort of ster-
ilization on a small
scale

  george had been slight-
ly indignant you put
a disagreeable interpreta-
ilization on a small
mon facts that may
amuse you julius but i
fail to see how such spec-
ulations can have any practical value 
they might serve as a warning to such
as you

  warning

  yes if i-understand your motives cor-
rectly you want to explore for life in me-
tcoric substances since they consist of mat-
ter in a very low state of energy-and be-
cause mere cold is not always fatal to life
even as we know it i fully believe that you
will find what you are looking for

  that is gratifying it makes you prac-
tically unique among scientists

  julius had not appeared amused but i
am far from believing that you are wise in

a rowley hilliard
death from the stars



attempting it when you find it-what
then

  what then-i dont understand you
well-do you expect it to be identical
with some form of life we experience on
earth

  not necessarily

  probably

  no i should say that the probability
points in the other direction life is a pro
duct of its environment and it would be a
remarkable coincidence if this supposed
new life had developed under conditions
identical with those on earth

  it is my theory that some such life may
exist in meteoric substances in a state of
suspended animation-induced perhaps by
lack of heat and most certainly by lack of
food to put it briefly i intend to test for
ils presence with a variety of temperatures

and a variety of foods

	george remembered that julius had nod-
ded absently there had been a strange look
in his heavy eyes as he asked quietly 

  and are you not afraid

  george shuddered now as he lay back
in his chair he felt dizzy and sick his
body was numb with that helpless prickly
numbness one sometimes feels locally when
his foot is asleep yes he was afraid
now-but then he had merely said

 afraid-afraid of what

i good lord man dont you see it you
have just admitted that you expect this new
life to be different from anything on
earth     

  but ldont see why a mere difference-
wait let us go a little more deeply
into this life-as-adisease idea not only
is life as a whole a disease of matter but
ench species of life is a disease to every
other the tubercular bacillus on the wall
of your lung has no more personal animos-
ity towards you than you had towards the
duck you ate for dinner it is merely liv-
ing off its environment as you are ob-
viously mankind is as truly a disease of
ducks as tuberculosis is of mankind   

julius makes a gift

qct see what you are driving at you
j mean that any new life i might dis-

cover would automatically be hostile to
many or all terrestrial species yet i see
nothing terrifying in that man has cer-
tainly dealt with any number of hostile
species during his existence and has-

  man has dealt with nothing julius cut
in angrily man has been dealt with you
talk as if he had arrived at his present form
by an act of will and fine determination
that is contrary to the first principles of
evolutionary science man is a form of life
that has been shaped by its enemies yet
even after millions of years of adaptation
he is not immune to attack-attack by spec-
ies which are a part of the very environment
in which he has developed  and you
propose to introduce something new good
god

  when angry julius was somewhat over-
bearing george had asked meekly well
then would you advise me to give up the
idea

  no no no am i your master do i
do your thinking for you damn it man
-make up your own mind i want to be
sure you know what youre about-thats
all

  there had never been any doubt in
georges mind about what he was going to
do he made that clear

  all right do you have your meteor-
ite

  no it is astonishingly difficult to get
hold of one so far i have had no luck at
all

  julius drew a folded newspaper from his

pocket and held it out indicating with his

finger a paragraph-

   strange theft in museum
  an unidentified man visited the
  american museum of natural history
  late yesterday afternoon and depart-
  ed with one small meteorite the prop-
  erty of that establishment he was
  seen by a guard rapidly leaving the
  building after having stood for some
  time over a case containing a number
  of similar exhibits dr hardman
  curator when questioned could sug-
  gest no motive for such a theft

  george looked up curiously from the pa-
per julius was leaning back negligently
tossing from one hand to the other a small
black stone catch he said

  clumsily george caught it why you


wonder stories

cant-i cant-it isnt right he stammer-
ed

  that is my affair snapped julius the
moral stigma attached to you by the trans-
action-that of receiving stolen goods i
suppose-is very small and very theoreti-
cal 

 but-

  but nothing that little thing is go-
ing to be put to a real use instead of be-
ing eternally gaped at by a succession of
idiots who dont give a damn what it is or
where it came from  now im go-
ing

  but wait a minute julius what do
you really think about this experiment
what is your honest opinion

  i think it a very promising line of en-
quiry and a very laudable task praise-
worthy but uncertain

  what is this life you hope to find
how will you perceive it have you stop-
ped to think that there may be life that we
cannot observe through the senses develop-
ed on earth-that does not obey the rules
we have set up

  i suppose you will use assimilation as a
yardstick-a criterion by which to judge
you will look for something that increases
itself at the expense of other things a
ticklish job at the best because that some-
thing may be intangible immeasurable and
altogether strange to you in other words
you are looking for a new disease-one that
you will not understand when you find it 
what will it attack what will it feed on
  who knows

  julius had gone then an unsociable
man his visits were very rare and very
short

  george wished julius were there now he
needed someone else to think for him the
little block-the food-was gone was
there something there-something that in-
creased itself at the expense of other things
had he succeeded was there life   the
food was gone but where was the some-
thing that increased itself

  under the glass-it must be everything
had been sealed tight 

in the pot on the window-ledge was only
a stalk all the rest was black dust he
stared at it dully  suddenly a glimpse
of something on the arm of his chair made
him start violently it moved towards him
-a dead gray thing splotched with black
he stared at it unbelievingly   

  it was his hand

  george dixon struggled to his feet and
stood trembling in a wild panic what was
happening he stared at his hands    
diseased the word brought a new terror
juliuss words rang in his brain-life is
a disease  something that increases it-
self at the expense of other things he
stared pleadingly at the glass jar it was
under the glass it couldnt get out

  -life that we cannot observe through
the senses developed on earth-that does not
obey the rules we have set up    -some
voice was repeating the words in his
brain- -that does not obey the rules  

  a horrible possibility flashed into his
mind and with a sob he blundered out of
the room desperately slamming the door
he needed help-he needed julius the tel-
ephone 

   

  julius humboldt was cursing softly as he
grasped the receiver but when he laid it
down his expression was very serious the
confused babble on the wire would have
been meaningless to anyone else but it gal-
vanized him into action hurriedly he set
about dressing moving quickly about the
tiny room

  five minutes later a shabby figure he tip-
toed down a very shabby staircase and
emerged on tenth avenue turning east
he half walked half ran along forty-ninth
street towards broadway

  julius humboldt was shabby because he
was poor and because he did not care any-
way he was taciturn-perhaps a misan-
thrope although more inclined to disregard
his fellow men than to hate them

  he had once been a professor of chemis-
try at columbia university but constant
clashes with the authorities-having mainly
to do with his radical and unfounded theor-
ies-had necessitated his resignation he
now lived precariously on a small annuity
death from the stars



-seldom doing any work of a type calcu-
lated to increase his meagre resources he
had few acquaintances and only one friend
-young george dixon

  at broadway he plunged down the steps
into the subway and boarded a downtown
train arriving at the pennsylvania station
he learned that the next port washington
train left at four muttering to himself he
studied a time-table great neck-four-
forty  he paced up and down the plat-
form 

  the block is gone - gone its got
me     - and then something about a
geranium george had certainly sounded
strange-wild  there must be something
really wrong

  the block-he knew what the block was
george had written him a letter outlining
his method of procedure he had broken
up the meteorite-pounded and pulverized
it into a fine powder this powder he had
mixed with a combination of foodstuffs-
arimal and vegetable the whole combin-
ation he had then compressed under great
pressure into a small square block-which
he had then subjected to various tempera-
tures and various frequencies of ultra-violet
rays

  a simple almost childlike performance
julius reflected yet direct and reasonable
-characteristic of george if this gave no
results he would try some other way but
wait   

  george had said the block was gone
gone julius stood still biting his lips
stolen-ridiculous the thing had no
value 

  the gates clattered open and absent-
mindedly he boarded the train expensive
these long island trains he thought rueful-
ly for fellows like george who didnt have
to worry about money it didnt matter

  -its got me     - what could he
have meant by that  his hands thrust deep
in his coat pockets his chin on his chest
julius humboldt pondered the matter as
the train rumbled under the east river and
out into long island	

broadcasting death

as the journey advanced he began to
feel more agitated several times he
shook his head violently and once gave a
startled exclamation causing the few other
passengers in the car to turn amused eyes
in his direction many frowned slightly at
sight of the gaunt forbidding figure with
the face that was by now very very grim

  the great neck station was deserted and
he set out at a quick pace to cover the hah
mile to george dixons house the sky was
overcast and no signs of dawn were yet vis-
ible the damp air enveloped him like a
black mist depressing his spirits and seem-
ing to increase the sense of heavy foreboding
which he suffered the large house set back
among trees was an ominous jet shadow
as he approached it up a winding path
obsessed with a strange uneasiness he walk-
ed on tiptoe straining his eyes and ears

  in another instant he was frozen into im-
mobility by a laugh-a sudden high-pitch-
ed gurgling laugh it rose and fell and end-
ed in a sob

  he gazed fixedly at the house that was
not george who-what-was there slow-
ly he advanced mounted the steps and laid
his hand on the doorknob from inside the
house there came a thrill cry a crash-then
silence

  the door was unlocked for a long time
be stood very still his head thrust forward
then he slipped quietly into the black inter-
ior he remembered vaguely the plan of
the place to the left was the laboratory
to the right a sitting room and straight
ahead the stairway flanked by a narrow hall
leading to the back of the house he moved
to the left and felt along the wall to the
laboratory door a faint line of light show-
ed beneath it he knocked and waited but
there was no sound cautiously he pashed
open the door

  the room was untenanted light came
from a large globe in the ceiling he ad-
vanced across the floor his eyes darting to
right and left he paused over the table
in the center and gazed thoughtfully down
at the small heap of metallic dust under the
jar


wonder stories

  pretty well cleaned out he muttered
its gone all right again he glanced
around this time his eye was caught by
the unusual appearance of the flower-pot on
the window ledge it appeared to be filled
with something black he walked over and
dug into the surface with his finger under-
neath was dry earth it was just a thin
layer of powder on top he pursed his
lips

  a sound behind made him wheel around
and gaze into the hall-way slowly there
took shape in the darkness there a crouch-
ing mottled figure it was a man-half
naked-whose skin was a dead grey in
color-splotched with black it was star-
ing at him with wide fixed eyes and creep-
ing forward with a convulsive motion of
the lower legs all the hope went out of
him as he recognized george dixon he
cursed

  george - in gods name whats the
matter

  julius humboldt had taken three quick
steps forward when the other leaped he
had a flashing glimpse of wide eyes flaring
nostrils bared teeth-and ducked instinc-
tively the flying body struck him a glanc-
ing blow on the shoulder and crashed full-
length on the floor he stared at it hor-
rified

  george

  the prostrate creature screamed and beat
the floor with its fists humboldt recoiled
instinctively

  mad he breathed through white lips
he advanced gingerly and kneeling down
placed a hand gently on the others shoul-
der there came a quick sharp snarl and
he snatched his hand violently from between
the others closing teeth

  again he leaped back and stood rigidly
still hurried thoughts raced through his
brain he would have to do something for
george-and do it quick a doctor   

  he frowned irritably what would a doc-
tor do he didnt want some fool messing
around and making things worse what
would a doctor treat for what was wrong
with george - that was the question

he had better assume it was the experi-
ment that was doing it he had been

only half serious when he had warned
george about it but now    obviously
the experiment had been a success george
had found something-something that had
consumed the food under that jar might
as well call it life as anything else al-
though it must be totally different from
terrestrial life something in the form of
a ray-light ray gamma ray-something
that could pass through glass yes he was
pretty sure of that but then what would
it do

  he stood rigidly still gazing with unsee-
ing eyes down at the now quiet figure on
the floor he must marshal all the facts
he must understand this thing in order to
conquer it  

  george had babbled something about a
geranium now what    suddenly he re-
membered the flower pot and his eyes wid-
ened at last the thing became clear to him
he felt that he could visualize graphically
what had happened-what was happening
rays shooting out-radiating-in all direc-
tions from the jar passing through the
plant on the window ledge-and consuming
it passing through george 

  he shuddered the brain the nerves-the
most delicate organs-would go first natur-
ally he must do something-get a doctor
a sedative might help he left the room
and locked the door behind him making
for the telephone stand he tripped over
something it was the telephone it was
loose-the wires torn out of the box

  well there was an extension in georges
bedroom he took the stairs three at a
time there was a light in the room he
had just picked up the phone when some-
thing peculiar caught his eye the bed
sheet was a strange dark grey in color he
bent closer yes-something wrong he
touched it and started violently the sheet
ciumbled to powder under his hand he
shook his head in bewilderment 

  obviously the sheet was affected in the
same way as george and the geranium but
why the sheet why not something nearer
the laboratory   then he gasped as
the full meaning of the phenomenon burst
upon him it was george that had infected
the sheet george was being fed on by the
death from the statys



strange disease therefore george was giv-
ing off the rays-and in enormously greater
quantities than the little block had done

  the horror of the situation overcame him
and he sat down heavily upon the bed
george broadcasting death he tried to
look ahead-to understand the full signifi-
cance of that fact

  george broadcasting death-impregnat-
ing anything and everything that came near
him and then infected tilings radiating it
in their turn 

  where would it stop what could stop
it he shrugged his shoulders helplessly
you couldnt fight a thing you knew noth-
ing about the thing would spread like
wild-fire george was a menace to man-
kind-to all life--to the world

  absent-mindedly he picked up the tele-
phone shrugged again and set it down   
couldnt call a doctor couldnt call any-
body nobody would understand they
would take george to a hospital where he
would spread disaster at a terrific rate or
they would hang around and infect them-
selves then go out and spread the thing
warnings would be no use people never
paid any attention to warnings they could
not understand they would laugh at him
he could hear them 

  life from the stars indeed    disease
from afar-ha ha they would call him
mad-and then fall victims to the thing they
derided and the minute a few were af-
fected nothing could stop it he himself
knew more about it than anyone else but
he had no idea how it could be checked 

  he wondered vaguely if he were infect-
ed perhaps not in so short a time
well he would be before he got through

  he would have to work alone   work
-he drew his hand across his eyes-work
   on what grimly he considered he
couldnt leave george certainly must try
to save him no matter how small the
chances must study the rays-try to find
out    

the stain on the wall

from below came a thud and a heavy
pounding on the laboratory door he
shivered slightly

  what to do with george would have to
keep him quiet frowning heavily he de-
scended the stairs the racket in the labor-
atory was steadily increasing in volume to
the pounding was now added shrill angry
cries

  a hypodermic of some sort would be
necessary for such noises would soon bring
inquisitive people-and inquisitive people
meant disaster but how to get dope with-
out a doctor he knew of a doctor in the
city who minded his own business but deals
like that required money and he had no
money  well he had to do something
right away you could hear that howling
a block

  he unlocked the door as he turned the
knob the door burst open knocking him
violently backwards before he could re-
gain his balance the other was upon him as
lie was borne to the floor all other emo-
tions were dominated by his amazement at
the homicidal tendencies of this man who
a week ago had been as mild-mannered and
studious as one could wish

  he fought vainly against the powerful
frenzied grip on his throat blood pounded
in his ears his temples throbbed with
his one free hand he reached along the
floor for something that he knew was there
he found it-the telephone-and swinging
it up relentlessly clubbed the head of his
assailant the grip on his throat relaxed
and the body of george dixon rolled over
limply on the floor getting to his feet
he raised it in his arms and slowly mount-
ed the stairs he laid it on the bed and
bent over it out for three or four hours
he decided with relief he needed at least
that

  he searched methodically through the
clothes in the closet but found only a little
over six dollars a further search of the
bureau netted only the check-book of a local
bank he stared at this latter find long and
thoroughly then shook his head no he
would try searching the rest of the house
first an hours search however brought
no results and at seven oclock he was
seated at a desk with the check-book and
ore of georges letters before him

	promptly at nine he was at the local bank

the young teller looked thoughtfully at the
check he presented

  are you staying with mr dixon mr-
mr    

  humboldt yes i am

  well-its a rather large-

  if it is identification you want i have a
letter from mr dixon to myself said hum-
boldt brusquely

  the young man studied the proffered let
tei gravely all right sir you know we
have to be careful sir how will you have

it

  humboldt caught the nine-fifteen train
to the city he sat huddled in the corner of
a car feeling very tired and a little sick
he felt that he was on a fools errand
george he knew could not be saved it was
only a question of how long he would live
not very long probably a thing that can
attack vital nerves kills quickly 

  humboldt stirred uneasily in his seat
georges death he reflected grimly would
not end the matter far from it  there
was enough substance in his body to feed
the disease for weeks-months perhaps and
throughout all that time the deadly radia-
tions would continue-menacing all life
passing through all barriers 

  all barriers-he remained deep in
thought during the rest of the journey by
the time the pennsylvania station was
reached he had come to a decision

  an hour later-richer by a few grams of
morphine and a syringe poorer by a con-
siderable sum of money-he was studying
a classified telephone directory finding
what he wanted he called a number and
gave an order there appeared to be some
difficulty at the other end and he spoke
irritably-	

  yes-lead can you hear me    
good - do you have one or not   
good i want immediate delivery    
what  i dont care what it costs 
yes-this afternoon    good  get a
truck i will pay all delivery charges 

he gave the address and hung up the
journey back to great neck he spent
in deep thought how to study the rays
how to make them tangible-measurable

-an electroscope photographic plates

  he groaned in despair all that was so
arduous-so complicated and he had need
for speed the rays were spreading rapid-
ly he was certain eating into the timbers
of the house into the ground perhaps   

  to his immense relief the house was
quiet when he let himself in at the front
door he mounted the stairs on tip-toe and
cautiously unlocked the bedroom door cau-
tion left him then and for a moment he
was overcome by nausea forcing himself
he approached wide-eyed the black lump
on the bed the head was bald and the
one ear that he could see was no more than
a stump the nose was a black wound in
the ghastly face the eyes were gone

  fighting his disgust he reached out a
hand the body felt like warm mud he
shuddered and drew back     no need
for the hyp now-but he was glad he had
got the other thing 

  his eye was caught by three ugly indenta-
tions in the skull his work   

  horror surged up within him and he
dashed headlong from the room and down
the stairs he sank weakly into a chair in
the living room he was trembling felt
very tired-incapable of thought he
knew he had better get out of the house
death was there he imagined the rays
driving through the air about him he felt
that he could almost see them they would
be coming from many sources now-shoot-
ing in all directions 

  his head fell back upon the cushion of
the chair he knew he must get up but he
nteded a little rest his strength was ex-
hausted  suddenly his eyes became in-
tent he had been gazing at the ceiling
but had not until now noticed the dark ir-
regular stain in its center

  he wondered about it it alarmed him
somehow 

  what would cause such a stain what
was above this room feebly he concen-
trated on the problem the stairs    the
hall-to the right was-yes georges bed-
room the thing was lying there-yes
in the center right above the stain 

  he shivered he would have to get out
but he needed a little rest he relaxed  
death from the stars



  the stain had a peculiar shape he de-
cided that it had legs-a head-and one
arm he watched it steadily it seemed to
move a little 

  yes it was moving in sudden alarm
he struggled to rise but could not the
one arm of the shape was stretching out to-
wards him he knew how it would feel-
like warm mud  his terror was a phy-
sical pain but he could not move

  suddenly it was all around him-the
warm mud he was sinking in it and could
not breathe death was near but help was
coming he could hear it-a small bell
very faint then a booming sound he re-
newed his struggles-and suddenly was
free 

  julius humboldt opened his eyes and
leaped to his feet angrily he had been
asleep now there was somebody at the
front door-ringing knocking he would
have to go but it was a damned nuisance
lie stepped into the hall certainly didnt
want visitors but maybe it was   

  he started slightly as he swung open the
d or and saw the policeman he remained
silent collecting his wits 

  mr dixon home rumbled the officer

  julius humboldt put out his hand and
grasped the door-post he stood perfectly
still frowning then

  no he is not at home he said

  no-the officers tone was peculiar
-well maybe you know something about
this-is your name humboldt

  yes-humboldt stared fixedly at the
slip of paper the officer shook it impa-
tiently 

  whered you get this check he asked
loudly

  from mr dixon

  yes-well i wanna hear dixon say
that  he took a step forward hum-
boldt did not move

  mr dixon is not at home he repeat-
ed

one more crime

the officer growled oh-so youre
gonna get hard huh you better be
nice-get me this here check is a phoney

an i got a good mind to take you along to
the station now he eyed the others shab-
by clothes with extreme disfavour

  you know that you can do nothing of the
sort pointed out humboldt calmly un-
til you have found mr dixon

  well im gonna find im soon enough
an now im gonna search this house he
made another forward movement still
humboldt did not move

  yoi have a warrant-his voice was
cold

  again the policeman stopped and glower-
ed hard guy aint yu - well-

  he was interrupted by the sound of a
heavy truck rumbling up the drive he
turned what do these guys want
humboldts lips tightened that is none
of your affair

  no-well see about that hey
what do you guys want he addressed the
driver who had by now climbed down from
his seat

  the driver looked alarmed-then indig-
nant why we got the coffin  we was
tc deliver it here-a lead coffin an damned
heavy it-

  oh a coffin- the officer cut in he
swung around upon humboldt is that
all  say theres something damned
funny about this house  he looked up
ard down apparently including the entire
house in his broad sneer we got a lot
of complaints about noises in this house last
night-screams like  an now a
coffin

  suddenly he swung around and bellowed
at the gaping truck driver take that thing
down to the station-house an leave it there
we dont have no funerals around here with-
outthe undertaker and as for you- he
turned to humboldt-im cornin back -
get me  with a warrant-

  suddenly he stopped and gaped at the
other what the hell have you got on your
face

  a chill shot through humboldt he stif-
fened then that also is none of your
affair he said softly

  the officer favored him with a look of
concentrated venom all right wise guy


wonder stories

-you wait-he stamped down the steps
humboldt closed the door

  he walked very slowly and with clench-
ed fists to a mirror one glance was enough
to tell him what he wanted to know but
he stared for a long time with a kind of
fascination at his terrible face then he
turned and walked out of the house he
noted without surprise-scarcely with inter-
est-that the grass up against the front of
the porch was black-burnt-looking he
looked up at the window of georges bed-
room

  a maple tree grew near the house and
a large branch forked towards that window
the leaves were not green they too were
black and burnt-looking humboldt laugh-
ed harshly

  study the rays much chance he would
have you couldnt study a thing that
crumbled your body-stole your reason 
even his one little gesture had been thwart-
ed he thought bitterly he had hoped to
protect the world from george with a lead
shield and they had taken that

  he would be the second to go-but not
the last perhaps the policeman would be
the third he would warn him 

  warn him again he laughed he would
say dont go into that house-warrant or
nc warrant in there is invisible death i
dont know what it is it comes from out
of the skies 

  and the policeman would say gettin
funny huh

  but even if the policeman were convinced
and didnt go in the rays would spread-
through the grass through the trees through
the ground how much air could they tra-
verse

  what were they he called them rays
he had made a word picture for them but
it was just a word picture-nothing more
this lie knew that they were something that
fed on earthly substances-mainly living
things it seemed how could you stop a
tiling like that 

  he stiffened suddenly his jaw set and
he strode swiftly to the road and down the
hill towards the town he would try once
more he might beat the policeman to it
he smiled grimly thief forger buyer of

drugs possibly murderer-he would try to
beat the law once again he would com-
mit one more crime-perhaps two

  ten minutes brought him to a filling sta-
tion do you have any five-gallon tins
he inquired of the attendant

  yes sir

  well my car is out of gas-up in mr
dixons garage i want you to fill two tins
and drive me up there

  well i can give you a gallon and then
you can stop by here and-

  do what i say snapped humboldt
and dont stand too near me

  the other merely gaped at him

  get it-humboldt threw a roll of bills
at the attendant the latter succeeded in
mastering his astonishment

  yes sir he cried he filled the cans
and placed them in a rickety car hum-
boldt got into the back seat

  go up the driveway and set them down
at the front he directed the other pulled
up before the front steps

  dont you want them in the garage he
objected

  do as i say said humboldt again the
man deposited the cans on the steps and pre-
pared to go

  had a fire he inquired chattily look-
ing around at the grass

  humboldt did not answer he lifted one
of the cans and lugged it into the house
he heard the car rattle away

  from the kitchen at the back of the house
he secured a dipper and began methodical-
ly to scatter the liquid in all the rooms-on
the floors walls ceilings and furniture he
hurried running from one room to another
his legs felt numb he was a little dizzy
and then there was the policeman 

  he went upstairs in one of the rooms
he found a closet which had a tiny window
looking out upon a grove of trees at the
back of the house

  private in back he muttered with an
approving smile then he tried the key in-
the lock and put it  the inside he went
on with this work upon the thing that had
been george dixon he poured a gallon of
the fluid then he went downstairs and out
oi the house
death from the stars



  there was no one in sight the grounds
were fairly spacious the nearest house being
over three hundred yards away slowly he
walked around the house emptying his sec-
ond tin on the walls and porches-on the
grass lastly he laid a little train of it out
across the back yard it was getting
dark

  he lighted a cigarette and stooping
dropped the match on the last little splotch
of gasoline a tiny flame shot up and ran
towards the house

  he walked slowly around to the front
and went in locking the door behind him
he sat down on the staircase and reaching
into his pocket drew out the little bottle of
morphine and the syringe might as well
make use of it after all he thought with
some satisfaction

  the sight of his hands sickened him ug-
ly black-looked as if they might fall
apart he charged the syringe from the
bottle

  perhaps he was saving other people from
having hands like this deprived of food
this life or whatever it was from another

star might die a natural death then again
k might not but the chances were that he
was doing a whole lot of people a lot of
good

  he dug the needle into his leg and laugh-
ed anyway he had nothing to lose a
fine hero julius humboldt had al-
ways found it hard to be sentimental 
he got to his feet and slowly climbed the
stairs it was difficult to move he went in-
to the closet and lifted the tiny window a
roar and a wave of hot air greeted him he
drew back with a smile and locked the closet
deor

  a tongue of flame shot up past the win-
dow licking at the sill he gazed at it ad-
miringly wonderful stuff-fire   clean
 pure  vital  highest state
of matter

  the heat was choking him now the roar-
ing and the heat were now tremendous
he laughed

  robbery  forgery  murder  arson
   and now one more

  he tossed the key into the flame

between dimensions



in the autumn of  i spent the month
of october with loren rogers at his
camp in northern wisconsin it was my
first visit although this invitation was a
long standing one and only the press of
work had kept me from
taking advantage of it
before loren had been
my closest friend al-
most since childhood

we had been class-
mates in high school
took our engineering
courses at the same un-
iversity and were to-
gether in the chemical
warfare division dur-
ing the world war of
-

 my name is paul
dahn i am a chem-
ist by profession -
perhaps i should say
a retired chemist since
i spend little time in
the laboratory these
days-and my name
may be not wholly un-
familiar to some of my
readers as the in-
ventor of dahnite i
was at one time until
its usefulness was su-
perseded by the new
atomic explosives fair-
ly well known i men-
tion this simply be-
cause it may in some
degree silence the in-
evitable accusation
that i am merely an-
other publicity seeker
spinning a wild yarn
in the hope of grab-
bing a few moments in
the limelight

  loren had abandon-
ed engineering for lit-
erature after the war-it is a pity that he
instead of myself could not have been the
writer of this chronicle at the time of my
visit he was finishing a novel in fact that

was the reason he was staying on alone at
the camp through the autumn on my ar-
rival he was all for throwing his typewriter
out the window and declaring a general
holiday i had to threaten to pack up and
go home before i
could get him to listen
to reason and we fin-
ally settled the argu-
ment by a compromise
he was to work on al-
ternate days and play
around with me only
on in between on his
writing days i would
amuse myself

                      at that time rocket
                    planes were just be-
                    ginning to replace the
                    old-fashioned propel-
                    ler type machines
                    loren had one of the
                    first ones a little two-
                    seater amphibian it
                    was a pretty crude af-
                    fair judged by modern
                    standards-it made the
                    most ungodly racket
                    you ever heard in your
                    life and its top speed
                    was barely four hun-
                    dred miles an hour
                    but at the time it was
                    quite the latest thing
                    out and we were as
                    keen about it as kids

                   we spent most of
our time in that fool
machine just gadding
around the country
we went pretty nearly
everywhere our most
ambitious attempt i
remember being a
jaunt out to san fran-
cisco to see a stan-
ford-california game
it will make you smile
i suppose but in those days to go that far
and come back all in the same day seemed
not much short of miraculous we got a
great kick out of it we would stagger out

 the wonders of jimen
   and space are just be-
  ginning to be appreciated
  in this fourth decade of the
  twentieth century the
  fitzgerald contraction the-
  ories the einstein discov-
  eries are awakening us to
  the astounding possibilities
  of changes in matter and
  unbelievable dimensional
  transformations

    we know that in our or-
  dinary lives we occupy
  space and we move through
  time we had once believed
  with the old classical phy-
  sics that no two bodies can
  occupy the same space at
  the same time but we
  did not understand what
  the word space meant

   modern physics has
  taught us that the space
  we occupy does not pre-
  clude another body occupy-
  ing the same space in fact
  we know that an almost in-
  finite number of bodies may
  coexist with us in the same
  space but on different
  planes of existence

    mr keiths astonishing
  dimensional story is not
  based on imaginative the-
  ories but on scientific prin-
  ciples and he has given
  us a picture of other worlds
  that is so intriguing so col-
  orful that one cannot but
  wish to change for a time
  his space-time position
  for that experienced by our
  authors characters	


wonder stories

of the old bus at the end of one of our crazy
expeditions stiff and sore from hours of
cramped sitting deafer than posts from the
roar of the engines and feel as proud of
ourselves as though we had been to mars and
back we had a grand time

  then along in the third week of my
stay i developed a toothache-a good live-
ly one the nearest village was only twen-
ty miles away and undoubtedly supported
a dentist competent to relieve my sufferings
but that of course was too prosaic a solu-
tion of the difficulty for my taste nothing
would do but that i must take the plane and
fly to chicago to my own dentist i started
early the following morning and as it
happened to be one of lorens work days
i went alone

the early rocket en
gines were by no
means as dependable as
they have since become

no alloys had yet been
developed that would
stand the terrific temper-
atures generated and the
combustion chambers of
lorens plane were lined
with fused quartz after
an indefinite period of
use these quartz linings
were given to cracking

they then rapidly broke
up and were blown out
of the rocket whereupon
the outer shell of steel
promptly melted unless the fuel was im-
mediately shut off

  as i have said for nearly three weeks we
had been flying the plane almost continu-
ously and i now fell heir to all the trouble
that had heretofore been impending one
after another the rockets conked out on me
until only four out of twelve were left i
finally limped into the airport at chicago
on one third the planes normal motive
power the repairs not only held me over
until the next day they were not completed
until late afternoon and although the re-
turn trip was uneventful i did not arrive
until nearly sunset of the second day i

had of course telephoned loren immediate-
ly after reaching chicago and told him not
to expect me until the following day

  our landing field was a small meadow
about a hundred yards from lorens cabin
which perched on the crest of the highest
hill in the neighborhood i can remember
that even as i began to mount the path i
had a presentiment of something wrong i
cannot explain it but it came to me very
powerfully a feeling of apprehension and
disquiet coming in the kitchen door the
first thing that met my eye was lorens gor-
don setter horatius the dog had crawled
under the cook-stove when i spoke he re-
fused to obey and when i finally lost pa-
tience and grabbed his collar and hauled
him out bodily he cow-
ered trembling against
my shins he was obvi-
ously frightened and
badly frightened i rais-
ed my voice and shouted
but i think even then i
expected no answer and
i received none the
house was empty loren
was gone

  his absence in itself
was no cause for worry
but the state of the dog
and my own nameless
foreboding stimulated my
imagination when ihad
made a wide circuit
through the forest about
the house hallooing
every moment or two without result i re-
turned to the cabin oppressed by the convic-
tion that something dreadful had happened
in the living room i caught a glimpse of
my tense face in the mirror and abruptly
tried to snap out of it

  you damned fool i told myself
youre simply letting yourself be stampeded
into a case of nerves nothing has happen-
ed theres nothing that could happen
stop being a silly ass loren is just out
prowling around somewhere hell be back
any minute

  i forced myself to sit down and resolute-
ly took up a magazine determined to be

sensible but at the end of an hour loren
had not appeared and i determined to call
the sheriff at the county seat and ask him
to send out a search party however when
i attempted to do so the telephone was dead
by this time daylight was gon and i curs-
ed myself for the delay there was no way
of getting help now until morning i
might possibly be able to take off in the
plane despite the darkness but our meadow
was the only landing place within miles
and on the return with a posse to locate
it from the air in the darkness was out of
the question the season had been abnor-
mally dry and i dared not leave a fire for a
beacon because of the danger of starting a
forest fire there seemed nothing to do ex-
cept to wait for the dawn hoping mean-
while that loren would show up

  i again made a circle around the cabin
without discovering anything then i pre-
pared and ate a skimpy meal not that i
was hungry but it gave me something to
do after that there was nothing but the
slow waiting for the long hours to drag
themselves through from time to time i
went outside and yelled but the starry vast-
ness of the night gave back no reply i was
really alarmed then

  i tried to read but i could not keep my
attention on the printed page i fiddled
with the radio but like the telephone it was
dead and over and above my worry about
loren there was growing within me a name-
less apprehension a fear a feeling that
something-something horrible-impended
it was horatius who made it impossible for
me to shake it off if i say it myself i
think i have my normal share of courage
and i know that i am not given to imagin-
ing dangers that do not exist but the con-
duct of the dog definitely upset me

  he clung to my heels at every step and
when i sat down insisted upon cowering
at my feet his tail never came out from
between his legs his whole attitude bespoke
a deadly fear and his fear communicated
itself to me  even after i had locked the
doors and placed a rifle and pistol handy
i found myself starting at each sudden noise
from the night outside

about eleven oclock i threw myself
down on the couch in the living room
and despite my anxiety and apprehension
went to sleep i cannot explain it for i was
neither tired nor sleepy perhaps the light
overhead shining down into my wide-open
eyes had a slightly hypnotic effect any-
way i dozed off  

   i awoke with a start to my surprise it
 was broad daylight and to my still great-
 er surprise my watch gave the hour as a
 moment after twelve oclock i had the
 feeling of having slept only a short time
 and it was inconceivable that i had actual-
 ly slept until noon yet my timepiece was
 running and i knew it to be an accurate
 and dependable one i sat up abruptly and
 said what the devil

   it was the sight of the dog that called my
 attention from this puzzle the sun had dis-
 sipated my fears of the night before but the
 moment my eye fell upon horatius they re-
 turned with a rush the dog was cringing
 in a corner of the room trying apparently
 to crowd himself right through the intersec-
 tion of the walls his hackles had risen and
 his lips were drawn back from his teeth
 but the sound that issued was neither a
 snarl of defiance nor a growl of anger it
 was a whimper of deadly fear

  a shudder ran through me the next
moment i had leaped across the room and
seized the rifle that leaned against the wall
i whirled about with the weapon in my
hands seeking the cause of the animals ter-
ror the movement brought one of the win-
dows into my line of vision and abruptly
my momentary panic was displaced by the
most profound shock of astonishment that
any mortal ever experienced for instead
of the familiar rolling forest that should
have been there the window framed a vista
of yellow sand boulder dotted and shim-
mering in the heat scattered at sparse in-
tervals over the surface of this desert were
clumps of unfamiliar trees they looked a
little like palms but their size far outdis-
tanced any palm i had ever seen they
towered two three even four hundred feet
into the sky when i opened the window a
blast of heat like the breath of a furnace
fanned my face


wonder stories

  i shall not try to describe my emotions
for the simple reason that i did not have
any i was utterly numbed mentally and
physically i must have stood there for a
full minute or two stupidly clutching the
casement which i had flung open until
horatius put up his nose and uttered a long
mournful howl

  i turned around then and swore at him
savagely it seemed to make him feel bet-
ter for he gave me a look of recognition
and did not howl again he stayed how-
ever tight in his corner i crossed to an-
other window looked out and then stopped
hesitantly in the middle of the room i
did not know what to do it is significant
perhaps that it never once entered my head
that i might be dreaming i knew that it was
real

  i decided presently that my first move
would be to reconnoiter i went outside and
walked around the cabin the house itself
was all intact and i could discover no
feature of it that seemed unfamiliar or show-
ed evidence of change it sat solidly on its
foundation of logs the ground around it
was not marked by so much as a scratch
there was in short nothing not one thing
about its exterior appearance to indicate
that it had ever been moved an inch since
the day it was erected the landscape on
every side was as i had seen it from the
window however the cabin stood at the
center of a shallow depression or bowl and
it was impossible to see more than half a
mile in any direction my next step ob-
viously was to see what lay beyond the
rim

        chapter ii
        a new world

i went back into the house and saw
to arming myself the gun i had
brought out the evening before was an
aguchi carbine that loren had picked up
during the war and kept as a souvenir fit-
ted with explosive ammunition it was an
effective weapon but i knew that loren
also had one of the new hydrogen rifles
which had been put on the market only

a year or two before- when i looked it was
not in its accustomed place

  i searched the whole house thoroughly
without discovering any trace of it and
my lack of success finally led me to the first
coherent thought since my first awakening
the thing that had happened to me was so
utterly impossible that i had not even tried
to speculate about it i did not try now
but it suddenly occurred to me that the
same thing had happened to loren per-
haps	

  the obvious explanation of the rifles dis-
appearance was that he had taken it he
might even now be somewhere in the neigh-
borhood the effect of this train of thought
was to cause me to dash out of doors and
fire a fusillade of shots i then brought out
the pile of kindling that was stacked beside
the kitchen stove made a fire smothered
it with rags and was rewarded by a thick
column of smoke which ascended straight
into the still air and must have been visible
for many miles

  satisfied that loren would see it if he were
anywhere near i resumed my preparations
for my scouting expedition i changed my
clothes-i still had on the sack suit i had
worn on my trip to chicago-loaded myself
with pistol rifle and ammunition and as an
afterthought dug out a canteen-another of
lorens souvenirs-and filled it at the wa-
ter pail in the kitchen i tried to persuade
horatius to accompany me bt he stub-
bornly refused to leave the house i didnt
blame him much it was certainly cooler
there so i sallied forth alone

  one direction seemed as good as an-
other i spat on a pebble tossed it in the
air and it came down pointing to the west
so west it was the sand was loose under-
foot and made the going slow but at the
end of a half an hour i panted up the last
few feet of the slope and stood on the rim
of the bowl i was deeply disappointed at
what i saw no slightest sign of life greet-
ed my eye save a flock of birds wheeling
across the distant sky i dont know just
what i had expected to find but i distinctly
remember the feeling of depression that
swept over me from where i was the
ground sloped away very gently toward the
between dimensions



west for perhaps four or five miles it
retained its desert character then the
clumps of giant palms became more fre-
quent and apparently merged at last into a
dense forest or jungle for the horizon as
far as i could see was a waving shadow of
green

  there was obviously nothing to be dis-
covered by going farther in this direction
i did an about face and retraced my steps
after stopping at the cabin to jettison my
pistol which had gotten confoundedly
heavy i went on in an easterly direction
coming over the edge of the depression i
found myself on a level plain which end-
ed abruptly a quarter of a mile away in a
precipice when at last i reached the edge
i stopped and gasped in amazement on my
right and my left the cliff at my feet ran
away in a straight line until it met the
horizon its height was terrific it fell away
in a sheer descent for at least a mile be-
fore me was the sea-and what a sea
blood-red in color it stirred restlessly far
below a vast expanse of shimmering scar-
let unbroken as far as the eye could reach
except for the tiny white streaks that were
whitecaps close to the base of the precipice
perhaps a mile down the coast and about
the same distance off-shore was an island
a towering pile of rock whose precipitous
sides soared into the sky almost to my own
elevation

  the strangeness the immensity of the
scene were absolutely crushing i sank down
beside a convenient boulder which shelter-
ed me from the suns burning rays and for
almost an hour remained lost in wonder
drinking in every detail of the staggering
vista that was spread before me then i
got up took a pull from my canteen and
began to walk along the edge of the cliff
in the direction of the island i wanted to
get a look at it from the other side the
height was so great that i had no sensation
of giddiness and i walked very close to
the brink where the footing was more
smooth

i had covered about half a mile when it
happened i must have unwittingly
stepped on a small round stone anyone

my feet suddenly shot out from under me
and the next thing i knew i had fallen across
the edge of the cliff and was sliding out-
ward it occurred so quickly that i had no
time to save myself i made a single des-
perate clutch at the rim and it failed i
did manage to get a half-hold with one
hand but my fingers slipped on the smooth
rock there followed a brief instant of
suspense the most horrible that i have ever
known then i fell free and dropped like
a plummet

  i imagine that i am the only human be-
ing who ever fell from a mile-high cliff and
lived to tell about it and it is regrettable
that i cannot describe for your benefit my
sensations in detail but unfortunately i
neglected to take any notes during my de-
scent i was i suppose so paralyzed by
fright as to be in a substantially fainting
condition at any rate i can remember
nothing at all of the fall beyond the familiar
elevator feeling in the pit of my stom-
ach

  my first conscious and coherent memory
after slipping over the brink of the cliff
is of sprawling on a grassy sward tremb-
ling in every limb my heart in my mouth-
but wholly unhurt my immediate reaction
to this miraculous escape from sudden death
was to be violently sick then i staggered
weakly to my feet and looked about me

  the towering precipice the bloody vast-
ness of the sea were utterly vanished in
front of me was a rolling meadow with a
tiny brook running through it at my back
was a park of noble trees on the grass a
few feet away lay my rifle i picked it up
and walked aimlessly away through the
park i was too dazed at what had happen-
ed to take any thought of what i was doing

  after a hundred yards or so i came to
what was obviously a highway paved with
yellow brick it was the first indication i
had had of other men-or perhaps i should
say intelligent beings-but i was not par-
ticularly surprised i had got past the
point of being surprised at anything i
turned into the road and followed it i saw
nothing at all unusual as i proceeded with
the exception of small metal tablets which
were set along the roadside at intervals of


wonder stories

about a quarter mile they might have been
mile posts but for the fact that they bore
no inscription a further peculiarity was
that they all when touched gave forth a
continuous musical note the pitch being ap-
parently the same in every case

  i had covered three or four miles before
anything untoward occurred then as i
was approaching a bend in the road a noise
from ahead caused me to stop i listened
for a moment and then prudently stepped
off to one side and concealed myself behind
some bushes a moment later a contraption
appeared around the curve which i can only
describe as a sort of mechanical centipede
it consisted of a flat platform perhaps ten
by twenty feet in dimensions supported up-
on a great number-at least thirty or forty
-jointed legs

  no driver was visible nor as far as i
could discern was there any source of mo-
tive power but the device nevertheless trot-
ted past me at a speed of about thirty miles
an hour keeping squarely in the middle of
the road piled upon the platform was a
load of metal cylinders which looked a
little like elongated ash cans i remained
hidden for a few minutes after it had dis-
appeared and then continued my journey
in the direction from which it had come
my curiosity had been whetted and i in-
creased my pace

  about a mile farther on a second of these
extraordinary motor trucks caused me to
scuttle hurriedly into the underbrush a
third and a fourth soon followed and then
came a convoy of more than a dozen i
abandoned the highway entirely and made
my way through the woods paralleling it
but when a little later i came out on a mod-
est hilltop i discovered that the road before
me stretched away through the forest in a
straight line for as far as i could see some-
what disappointed i again took to the
bricks and went on

the mystery of the lake

i met nothing more in time i began to
feel tired i had been walking steadily
for four or five hours and covered a dis-
tance of probably fifteen miles the road

seemed to be getting nowhere it ran on
interminably and there was not even a
change of surroundings for miles after
mile on either side there remained the same
open forest but there came a time at last
when i saw far ahead of me framed between
the trees the blue sheen of water i re-
doubled my pace and presently came out on
the shores of a good-sized lake the road
ended here or rather it ran right right
into the lake

  i sat down there seemed to be nothing
else to do it was not unpleasant there
the sun sparkled on the surface of the lake
and a cool little wind blew across it the
temperature i should perhaps mention was
equable-much lower than in the desert on
which i had first found myself i might al-
so mention a curious circumstance which i
now noticed for the first time although
six hours had passed since i first came upon
the yellow road the sun had remained sta-
tionary in the sky i could not perceive
that it had moved a particle

  as i sat there a deep resonant sound came
from the depths of the lake and repeated it-
self several times it sounded not unlike
a dinner bell and reminded me that i had
not eaten for some ten hours i had come
upon no sign of game had seen no living
creature in fact except a few birds and
those at a great distance i got up and be-
gan to snoop about in the hope of finding
edible berries or fruits my search was un-
rewarded and after a few minutes i gave it
up and returned to the point where the road
entered the lake i then discovered that an-
other machine had appeared it differed
from those i had seen previously it was
much smaller for one thing its dimensions
being about the same as those of a piano

  it consisted of an open framework sur-
rounding an exceedingly complicated mech-
anism the whole moving about on four legs
affixed at the corners when i came closer
i discovered that it was engaged in repair-
ing the road by this time my curiosity had
got the better of my caution and i approach-
ed until i was almost close enough to touch
it it worked on steadily quite heedless of
my presence ripping up row after row of
bricks spreading cement and relaying
between dimensions



them i was fascinated but after only a
few brief moments it apparently finished
its job then to my astonishment it wad-
dled straight out into the lake and in a
moment was completely submerged for
some time it remained visible through the
clear water steadily descending lower and
lower until at last it disappeared

  one puzzle was solved it was now ap-
parent that the unusual termination of the
yellow road was not an accident it did not
end at the lake but in it somewhere in
those depths there must be a colony of in-
telligent beings the proprietors of the
machines i had seen it suddenly occur-
red to me that possibly the walking plat-
forms i had met on the road were a sort of
motor bus perhaps each of the cylinders
they carried was filled with water and con-
tained a living creature in the act of being
transported to another lake or river

  a thousand questions thronged my mind
but after a moment i resolutely set them
aside the really important question was
when did i eat i was hungry i was in
fact very hungry and i had not the slight-
est idea where my dinner was coming from
i had not given much thought to the matter
before but i now saw that my situation
might be serious as i have mentioned i
had seen no game nor anything else of an
edible nature the problem of food would
soon be an important one

  but at this moment happening to glance
up the road my eye fell upon one of the
moving platforms it was only a couple of
hundred yards away coming toward me
and was loaded in the same manner as those
i had seen earlier in the brief time before
it reached me my decision was made i was
going to have a look at what those cylin-
ders contained

as i had hoped when the machine came
near to the waters edge it slowed
down and as it went by i managed to poke
one of the cylinders free with my rifle it
rolled off onto the beach it was about
two feet in diameter and when i had stood
it upright it came to my shoulder but the
cover would not come off i struggled un-
successfully with it for several minutes and

then stopped to rest as i was about to make
a second attack the difficulty was unexpect-
edly solved a loud buzzing sound from
the interior of the cylinder caused me to
jump back in alarm the cover began to
move it revolved rapidly for a few seconds
and then fell off i slipped the safety of my
rifle approached cautiously and peered
over the edge

  i do not know just what i expected to see
-a fish of some sort perhaps or an octopus
-but what l did see was nothing at all dis-
gusted i gave it a push it toppled over
at the lakes margin and the water gushed
forth but the next instant there was a ter-
rific thrashing in the shallows and a second
later my pop-eyed gaze detected a disturb-
ance of the sandy bottom as an invisible
something darted out towards the depths

  i prudently retreated to a point some fif-
ty yards from the water and there waited
for fifteen or twenty minutes watching the
surface of the lake intently but nothing
appeared and i presently decided that it
was high time i began a serious search for
food i set off toward the west skirting the
shore of the lake but keeping well back
from it it seemed to me just as well to be
in a position to beat an unnoticed retreat if
the denizen of the lake showed signs of dis-
approving of my presence

  i had covered only about a quarter of a
mile when i came upon a battery of squat
masonry towers dotting the wooded hillside
which sloped up from the waters edge
they were about fifteen feet in diameter
but only eight or ten feet tall and i count-
ed twenty-six of them altogether i decid-
ed that they were ventilators a leafy
branch held over the top of one of them
disclosed that a strong current of air was
entering whether they communicated with
underground chambers directly beneath or
whether the air was conveyed to the center
of the lake i had of course no way of de-
termining

  i found an old letter in one of my pockets
and brought it forth with the idea of writ-
ing or drawing a message on it and tossing
it into one of the ventilators the lack of
a pencil forced me to abandon this pro-
ject so instead i folded the bit of paper


wonder stories

into an airplane of the type known to
every schoolboy and with a grin tossed
it into the air above one of the towers and
saw it snatched out of sight by the draft
 have often wondered since if my under-
water friends ever found that toy and if
they did what they made of it

  a few hundred yards from this spot i
found my first food in the shape of an ex-
tensive patch of gourd-like vegetables ap-
parently growing wild they were inedible
raw but when i had built a fire and roasted
some i found them very good with a flavor
not unlike that of squash i stuffed myself
full then being dead tired and at no
time having seen any sign of dangerous ani-
mals i lay down beside my fire and went
to sleep when i awoke ten hours later i
felt like a new man

chapter iii

the city of machines

                                                               

i stayed in this vicinity two days i
say two days-by that i mean forty-eight
hours as measured by my watch actually
daylight was continuous the movement of
the sun being just barely perceptible i
estimated that at least  normal days must
be required for it to pass across the sky
once

  my reason for remaining here was that
i had not given up hope of establishing
communication with the inhabitants of the
lake they however apparently had no
desire for a closer acquaintance for during
this time they lay absolutely doggo no
more machines appeared and nothing hap-
pened to indicate that these queer transpar-
ent fish-or whatever they were-so much
as existed there was not much that i
could do about getting in touch with them
i threw stones into the lake for half an hour
once and another time i yelled down one
of the ventilating towers until i was hoarse
but neither action brought any result i
finally came to feel that i ought to be mov-
ing on

  about ten miles distant to the south i
could see a range of high hills and i re-
solved to see what lay beyond them i made

my simple preparations for the journey
chiefly the roasting of a number of squashes
and stringing them on a length of vine and
then lay down for a nap before starting
out

  but something far different was in store
for me i awakened out of a troubled sleep
with difficulty remaining for what seemed
like a long time in a semi-conscious state
vaguely aware that all was not well yet
wholly unable to assemble these misty ap-
prehensions into anything coherent my
first clearly defined sensation was a sudden
realization that i was moving the shock
of this understanding cleared my brain and
i opened my eyes

  i discovered then that i was a passenger
on one of the walking platforms it carried
a load of the metal cans i have previously
described on top of which i was sprawled
and was moving along a yellow road which
had every appearance of being the one i
had travelled when i attempted to move
i found that from the neck down i was par-
alyzed i was able to move my head but
that was all

  what had happened to me was at once
perfectly clear i had been drugged while
i slept

  my sensations may be imagined the vast
majority of men are capable i believe of
facing any imminent visible danger very
creditably the crisis produces in most of
us rather a pleasurable excitement than
fear but an invisible threat is something
else again and when the unknown menace
must be awaited in a condition of utter
physical helplessness one may i trust be
forgiven a slight uneasiness not far removed
from fear i freely admit i put in a very
bad half hour

  i was probably saved from complete funk
by my acute physical discomfort the par-
alysis affected the motor nerves only the
sensory nerves being uninfluenced and i
was acutely aware that in a literal as well
as a figurative sense i was lying on no bed
of roses a dozen sharp corners and pro-
jections dug into my helpless body and
since i was unable to make the slightest
move the irritation came in time to be really
torturing
between dimensions



    fortunately neither the pain nor the sus-
 pense lasted long we had been travelling
 evidently for some time before my awaken-
 ing for at a second glance i noticed that
 the forest beside the road was distinctly
 more open than i remembered it presently
 the trees gave out entirely and we emerged
 on an open plain the position in which i
 lay was such that i could not see in the di-
 rection in which we were moving i could
 note only the level pampas flowing past on
 either side and the steady recession of the
 forest from which we had emerged

   then after about twenty minutes we sud-
 denly came to a halt turning my head i
 now saw that we stood outside a low white
 wall a moment later we passed through
 a gate which closed behind us my convey-
 ance swung about and i let out an invol-
 untary gasp of astonishment as i saw what
 lay before me

 imagine if you can an enormous manu-
 facturing plant set up under the open
 sky and running full blast without a living
 soul in sight the white wall enclosed a
 space about half a mile square this was
 paved with the same yellow bricks of which
 the road was composed except for aisles
 or streets which ran between the entire
 space was covered by machines i could
 see the whole clearly from my elevation on

	top of the load the machines were of al-
 most infinite size and variety similar ones
 being apparently grouped together in bat-
 teries they were almost all in operation
 their clanking filled the ears yet not a
 single living creature was to be seen

    i then noticed in the aisles between the
 stationary mechanisms several types of mo-
 bile machines the largest and most con-
 spicuous was a sort of animated tripod about
 ten feet in height the three legs supported
 a cupola from which extended four long
 jointed arms terminating respectively in
 a hook a suction disk a four-fingered hand
 and a flat disc which i later learned was
 an exceedingly powerful electro-magnet
 these devices trotted busily back and forth
 apparently acting as tenders to the other
 machines

   i saw all this while my conveyance was

moving rapidly down an aisle that ran par-
allel to the wall it turned a corner ran a
few yards farther and stopped almost in-
stantly one of the tripods was above me and
the next moment i had been transferred to a
basket underneath its cupola my meagre
possessions which i had not missed nor
thought of followed-my rifle canteen my
string of roasted squashes-even a shovel-
ful of the blackened embers of my fire

  from this vantage point i now witnessed
the disposition of the rest of the load the
platform tilted the cans rolled off and were
picked up by a conveyor belt which car-
ried them into the nearest machine a large
enclosed box-like device thirty seconds
later the first of the empty cans was-sudden-
ly discharged and clattered out onto the
pavement and at the same moment the con-
veyor emerged from the opposite end of
the machine bearing its erstwhile occu-
pant

  i looked with pop-eyed curiosity at a sort
of worm or snake about six feet in length
transparerrt but clearly visible in outline
then in an instant my eager curiosity
changed to astonished dismay for it had
been neatly chopped into six still wriggling
pieces

  until this moment i had supposed that
the creatures from the lake were intelligent
beings the proprietors of the machines
now the appalling truth was made plain
the machines were the masters i was in
a city of machines

  the chopped pieces of the water snake
disappeared within the maw of the next
machine in the line i watched utterly
helpless to move a finger waiting in an
agony of apprehension until the last can
had been unloaded but my worst fear was
not to be realized-at least not yet the
tripod under which i was slung loaded the
empties back onto the platform it moved
off then we set out rapidly in the opposite
direction

  that journey across the city-we went
clear to the opposite side-was despite the
fear of imminent death that hung above me
an enthralling experience my trepidation
an excusable one i hope could not quench


wonder stories

my curiosity and i eagerly drank in every
detail that met my eye

  i tried ceaselessly to guess the function
of the machines we passed in endless var-
iety but without much success some of
them were obviously manufacturing metal
parts for other machines some were pro-
ducing the metals themselves others were
quite clearly electrical devices of one sort
or another but with most it was impossi-
ble to even guess at their purpose

  the tripod machines like the one that
carried me interested me most we must
have encountered fifty of them and it was
plain that they directed the others i ex-
amined my own closely but without gaining
any information except as to externals the
operating mechanism was hidden in the
cupola above me

another amazing experience

we stopped finally beside a long narrow
box perhaps eighty feet in length and
open at both ends through which ran a
conveyor moving very slowly when one
of the arms reached into the basket re-
moved the articles with me and placed them
on the belt i conjectured that this was some
sort of examining device and when i was
treated in the same manner i felt only a
slight uneasiness

  my guess proved to be correct i passed
slowly through under a brilliant illumin-
ation without anything untoward happening
until just before the end half a dozen
sharp augers suddenly bored into different
parts of my body for the purpose i sup-
pose of taking samples a moment later
i emerged in the open bleeding fyeely from
the wounds but not hurt at all seriously

  i was then carried to a wire cage only a
few yards distant and deposited therein
along with my rifle and canteen and the
charcoal from my fire

  my first thought of course was of es-
cape it seemed to me that the paralysis
was wearing off and this proved to be the
case i was able to move my hands and feet
within an hour although a considerably
longer time elapsed before i regained com-
plete control over my muscles the wire

offered no difficulty-i could break the
strands by using my rifle as a lever-and
the wall was only some fifty feet away
once over it i would be out of sight but
the problem of crossing the open space
without being observed seemed insoluble i
formed and discarded a dozen impossible
schemes and finally driven to desperation
by the knowledge that at any moment the
opportunity might be ended for ever i sim-
ply made a dash for it choosing a moment
when none of the tripod machines were near

  to this day i cannot imagine why i was
not stopped the machines must have seen
me if they had sight as i am sure they had
perhaps their analysis had showed that un-
like the water snake i was of no use to
them at any rate no effort was made to
halt me the wall was only about eight
feet high and with my rifle slung on my
back i scrambled to the top without difficul-
ty to my horror i then discovered that due
to the fact the land sloped away in this di-
rection the ground outside the wall on this
side was fifty feet below die top

  my despair can be imagined i expect-
ed every instant to be apprehended and re-
captured after a moment of frenzied search
for some other way out a fit of sudden
desperation descended upon me and i re-
solved to jump risking almost certain in-
jury or death rather than return i hast
ily unslung my rifle and tossed it free to
my astonishment it never reached the
ground it fell sheer down for forty feet
and then disappeared in thin air

  at such a moment the mind works rapid-
ly if it works at all ever since falling from
the cliff i had been searching off and on for
some explanation of my miraculous escape
from death and instantaneous transporta-
tion to a totally different environment now
in a flash it suddenly came to me

  apparently in this outlandish world in
which i had found myself matter possessed
the ability to change its location in three
dimensional space by passing through a
fourth dimension the existence of which was
invisible to the senses i had on two oc-
casions now seen this property demon-
strated by falling bodies and i conjectured
that the active agent in producing the phe-
between dimensions



nomenon was the velocity imparted to the
falling object by gravity

  the idea passed through my brain in a
fraction of the time it takes to tell it i
threw the canteen after the rifle it like-
wise disappeared before striking the ground
without a moments hesitation i then leaped
after them

  the sensation of falling lasted but an in-
stant the next i was sprawling on a
rocky surface and when i raised my eyes
they fell upon a scene that was familiar
behind me was the desert before me and
only a few feet away the stupendous preci-
pice fell away to the crimson sea the rifle
and canteen lay on the rock beside me

wtlen i looked about me i noticed that
while my surroundings were in a gen-
eral way familiar their details were not
for example the rocky island off the coast
was nowhere to be seen it was thus clear
that i had not neturned to the exact spot
of my fall from the cliff this being evi-
dently due to the fact that the city of
machines was several miles removed from
the meadow in which i found myself after
that first tumble but i hoped that by fol-
lowing the coast i might return to the cabin
unfortunately i had no idea which way to
go and in the end i was forced to make an
arbitrary choice and trust to luck that it
was the correct one

  the heat was terrific and i was by no
means sure that my strength was equal to
a march of many miles but that chance
had to be taken my canteen was full of
water i was only slightly hungry and if
the distance did not exceed thirty or forty
miles i felt that i had at least a chance of
success

  just before i started an idea occurred to
me unslinging my rifle i pointed it to-
ward the ground and pulled the trigger as
i had expected the rock showed no mark
of the bullet the projectile had been
translated into the fourth dimension before
it reached the muzzle of the gun after fir-
ing several rounds with the same result i
tossed the weapon aside it was useless
and there was no sense in encumbering my-
self with its weight then i set out

  the journey that followed will always
remain in my memory as the most gruelling
experience of my life i suffered horribly
from the heat the sun was pitiless beating
down upon me hour after hour with a
blasting malevolence that seemed almost per-
sonal my water gave out and before the
finish i had experienced all but the final
agonies of death of thirst

  but these details do not matter it is
enough to record that i had been fortunate
enough to choose the proper direction i
have no idea how far or for how long a
time i plodded mechanically on it seemed
a veritable eternity but in the end after
many hours and many miles i saw far ahead
the towering shaft of the island soaring up
out of the sea ages later i came abreast
of it passed it when i had put it a mile
behind me i turned away from the sea i
was so near to the point of utter exhaustion
that when i finally stumbled over the rim
of the bowl in the desert only to find no
sign of the cabin i collapsed from sheer
disappointment i tried twice to regain my
feet but without success then i must have
fainted

	  

  when i woke i was lying in the shade of
one of the giant palms and loren was seat-
ed beside me i shall not try to describe
the overwhelming relief and happiness that
swept over me and i am sure that he was
equally glad to see me i had slept like a
log for nearly twenty hours and felt better
than i would have believed possible we
fell at once to an eager questioning of each
other that served only to bewilder us both
and finally we burst into simultaneous
laughter at our mutual puzzlement then
more sensibly each gave a coherent account
of what had befallen him

  lorens experience had been less eventful
than my own although the manner in which
both began was identical the night i was
in chicago he had been awakened at mid
night to find it broad daylight and himself
and the cabin set down in the midst of the
desert his first act naturally was to ex-
plore the surrounding territory and on his
return six or seven hours later he found
 

wonder stories

to his astonishment and dismay that the
house had vanished

  during the next two days he suffered
much from hunger and thirst until he tried
the expedient of tapping one of the giant
palms a copious flow of yellow fluid re-
warded him which served excellently for
both food and drink he had lived on it
ever since

  he remained in the neighborhood and
on the fifth day-by his watch of course-
he saw my signal smoke from a point two
or thrae miles distant hastening back he
found the cabin and my signal fire this
together with my clothes scattered about in-
side and the disappearance of the aguchi
rifle told him of my presence

  he fired a number of shots and added a
second smoke to the one i had left since
at that time i had already tumbled off the
cliff his efforts to attract my attention were
naturally a failure then two or three
hours after his return while he was outside
tending the fire the cabin had vanished be-
fore his very eyes

  this utterly crazy series of events had
left him with some doubt as to his sanity
he had spent most of the time since fran-
tically searching the neighborhood for me

chapter iv

the monster of dimensions

as we compared our stories i think the
idea occurred to us both at the same
moment apparently the cabin had been
hopping back and forth between its right-
ful location in the wisconsin woods and the
outlandish spot in which we now were if
it again returned we had only to stay in-
side it to be rescued from the nightmare in
which we had found ourselves the whole
thiug was so fantastically impossible as to
forestall even an attempt at explanation
but the detail that puzzled us most was the
discrepancy in time although only twen-
ty-four hours had elapsed between lorens
projection into the unknown and my own
identical experience he was five days in the
desert before i arrived the only possible
explanation seemed to be that in the place

  where we now wre time itself was different
  than in our own natural world but as to
  the reason for this difference we could not
  even hazard a guess

    after a series of hasty calculations we
  decided that as nearly as we could deter-
  mine an interval of five days had separated
  the first and second appearance of the
  cabin in the desert it had remained for
  about five hours in both cases and then
  vanished if it returned again and came on
  schedule it was due to appear in about fif-
  teen hours

    we settled ourselves to wait and for-
 tunately for our patience our calculations
 proved to have been in error it was less
 than ten hours later that i was roused out of
 a doze by loren who was on watch he
 let out a wild yellj there she is

    and sure enough there she was

    we raced each other to the door inside
  everything was quite as we had left it hor-
  atius scrambled up to greet us as we burst
  in he was obviously overjoyed to see us
  and semed much less frightened than on the
  previous occasion evidently he was get-
  ting accustomed to it he was a very hun-
  gry and thirsty dog and our first act was
  to care for his wants then we raided the
  cupboard and had our first taste of civil-
  ized food in many days

    after that there was nothing to do but

	wait we played cards to pass the time
 until the tension became too great then
 we merely sat and figeted

    once the four hour-mark had been passed
  the suspense became almost unbearable
  the clock on the mantel ticked off the min-
  utes slowly oh so slowly four hours
  and a quarter four hours and a half
  four and three quarters at that we could
  stand it no longer we got up and began
  to pace the floor like caged animals a
  moment later as he passed one of the win-
  dows loren stopped suddenly then he
  cried excitedly my god paul whats
  that

    i leaped to his side and my eye followed
  his pointing finger for a moment i could
  perceive nothing then i saw what he was
  pointing at and a chill ran down my spine

    neither loren nor myself had at any time
between dimensions



seen a living creature with the exception of
a few birds and my transparent water
snakes i am convinced that this was not
because no animals existed but because all
or nearly all forms of animal life were in-
visible the thing that had attracted lor-
ens attention was the astonishing appear-
ance in the sand outside the house of a
double row of shallow depressions about
the size of dirner plates

  as we watched new ones were added to
each row the phenomenon was baffling to
loren but my memory of invisible aquatic
creatures caused me to guess instantly that
the depressions in the sand were the foot-
prints of an invisible animal the beast
was six-legged and from its spoor of enor-
mous size

  i grabbed lorens arm and jerked him
aside but too late the beast must have
seen him there was a blood-curdling snarl
from without and the next instant the win-
dow glass crashed as the creature hurled
himself at the opening

forgetting that it was useless loren
leaped across the room for his rifle i
dashed toward the kitchen in the wild hope
of laying hands on a knife it was just as
i crossed the threshold that the event which
we had been awaiting came darkness
snuffed out the sun for a second or two
i blundered frantically about the pitch dark
kitchen upset as much by the sudden dark-
ness as by the danger from the animal

  lorens nerve was better i heard the
shrill scream of his hydroxygen rifle as he
emptied its magazine then in a flash i
understood what had happened i leaped
into the living room yanked loren through
the kitchen doorway and slammed the door
behind us

  through the window we could see the
moon shining behind the trees the famil-
iar hillside sloped away and at the bottom
in the meadow the plane gleamed in the
moonlight precisely where i had left it
there was no need for speech without a
word loren flung open the outer door we
dashed down the path as though the devil
himself were at our heels loren scrambled
into the cockpit and started the engines

while i threw off the anchor lashings a
moment later we roared into the air to the
accompaniment of a pair of gigantic sighs
of relief at last at last we were safe

  we spent the night in a hotel in a city
two hundred miles away but next morning
made bold by daylight we armed ourselves
and returned we approached the cabin
with all due circumspection but our cau-
tion was unnecessary the beast that had at-
tacked us was sprawled on the living room
floor stone dead loren rifle had become
effective the instant the cabin returned to
its original site and three of his shots had
done their work horatius whom we had
basely abandoned in our flight had mount-
ed guard over the trophy he seemed quite
proud of himself giving us clearly to un-
derstand that he had done it himself despite
our cowardly desertion

  dead the animal was no longer invisible
it was about the size of a horse slate grey
in color and hairless its six feet were
padded like those of a lion but the head
was decidedly porcine in fact the creature
more nearly resembled a gigantic six-legged
hog than anything else

  neither of us cared to venture inside the
house so we contented ourselves with stand-
ing outside and looking in through the bro-
ken window as we stood there loren said
say you know its rather a lucky thing
this fellow came busting in on us at that
hes the only proof we have of our story
without him wed never in the world get
anyone to believe a word of it the thing
for us to do is to get some witnesses up here
right away

  wait a minute i said how about the
cabin itself i should imagine that the
most skeptical would be convinced if they
saw it vanish into thin air at least i sup-
pose it vanishes it certainly cant be in
both places at the same time

  youre right of course he admitted
id forgotten all about the cabin but to
tell you the truth when i look at it in broad
daylight i have a hard time convincing my-
self that it all really happened maybe it
didnt maybe weve just been seeing
things

  i pointed to the dead animal thats


wonder stories

real enough i guess my idea i added
would be to hang around here until mid-
night tonight and see what actually takes
place then tomorrow well call in the re-
porters

  we called the dog went down to the plane
and flew to the county seat we had din-
ner there that night and came back just
before sunset we did not go near the
house remaining in the meadow beside the
plane when the moon came up the cabin
was clearly visible from where we were and
neither of us had any inclination to be in-
cluded in the performance if the cabin re-
peated its previous tricks the night was
chill and we built a fire for comfort dur-
ing the hours of waiting it occurred to me
that we might just as well have built it on
the far side of the meadow a few hundred
yards farther away

a sudden discovery

but my nervousness was uncalled for
since we were at no time endangered
at precisely two minutes past twelve as
we had expected the cabin vanished that
was all there was to it no noise n dis-
turbance nothing simply that one mo-
ment it was there and the next it was gone

  loren suggested that we ought to go
closer and see what was left but i argued
against the proposition so brilliantly that
he was convinced i was plenty close
enough right there

  at fifteen minutes after twelve a bright
fire lighted up the horizon toward the
northeast it burned brightly for half an
hour and then died out and that ended
the program for the night nothing more
happened at daybreak the cabin had not
returned at nightfall it was still missing
we came back the next day and the next
we camped for a week in the meadow where
we could watch the spot day and night but
of the cabin there was no sign it did not
come back  it never has come back

  we did not call in the reporters we
did not call in anyone

  listen loren said this is our little
secret understand strictly between you
and me ive been accused of a lot of

things but i draw the line at being pointed
out as a hop-head if i can help it theyre
not going to have my picture in the papers
with the caption winner of champion
liar contest

  he really meant it he was so serious
about it that in the end i promised there
were times later when i regretted giving my
word for in after years i knew men with
whom i would have liked to discuss the
matter but i kept my promise i never
told a soul

	  

  that was nearly thirty years ago loren
has been gone now for more than a de-
cade but the habit of secrecy kept me silent
even after his death together we must
have thrashed out the affair a thousand
times but we never arrived at an explana-
tion that was in any degree plausible to
the day of lorens death and long after-
ward the mystery remained wholly insol-
uble

  it was about a month ago that i at last
stumbled on a clue i had dined with my
friend george du cles the physicist and
during the conversation afterward we got
to talking about the new augsberg theory
of which most of my readers have probably
heard since it achieved widespread public-
ity in the press one of the less important
details of the theory relates to the fitzger-
ald contraction

  but perhaps i might explain briefly

  about  fitzgerald discovered that
a moving body is shortened along the line
of motion and the phenomenon has since
borne his name at low velocities the fitz-
gerald contraction is very small at a speed
of nineteen miles a second the velocity of
the earth around the sun it amounts to only

	part in  or  inches in the
diameter of the earth but at higher veloc-
ities the contraction is much greatef in-
creasing quite quickly

  a bar measuring six feet in length when
at rest would be shortened to three feet at
a speed of  miles a second if its
length coincided with the direction in which
it was travelling if turned at right angles
to this direction its length would again be-
come six feet while its thickness would be
between dimensions



halved the contraction taking place only
along the line of motion at  miles
a second the velocity of light the fitz-
gerald contraction becomes infinite that is
the length of a body moving at this speed
would be reduced to zero

  it has always been held to be utterly
impossible that a material body could ever
be given any such velocity but now augs-
berg has demonstrated that that when an
object vibrates at very high frequencies its
motion backward and forward along the
same line produces the fitzgerald contrac-
tion just as though it were moving in one
direction only he has proved that it is
at least theoretically possible to produce
in this manner an infinite fitzgerald con-
traction the frequency required being in the
neighborhood of  billion
vibrations per second

vou know du cles remarked it
x has j ust occurred to me recently that
so far as this phase of the theory is con-
cerned leon scanlon anticipated augsberg
by  years do you remember him we
were together at the university he was as-
sistant to the head of the department and
had already begun to make a name for him-
self this was a good many years ago
around 

  no well i never saw scanlons math-
ematical proofs but i can remember the
talk about scanlons ideas in the depart-
ment they were identical with augsbergs
he never published he had worked out a
method for testing his theory and he wanted
practical proof before making it public he
had i recall a lot of trouble getting finan-
cial backing for his experiments the big
difficulty being that he required an enor-
mous amount of electrical power-four or
five million horsepower if i remember cor-
rectly

  finally he got sharps the utility mag-
nate interested sharps controlled most of
the power companies in the middle west
he put up the money and arranged mat-
ters so that scanlon could get the current
he required scanlon went up north some-
where-minnesota or wisconsin i believe
-and built himself a laboratory about a

year later it burned and he was killed in
the fire i paid little attention to it at the
time but it seems fairly certain now that
scanlon was on the trail of something
worthwhile it is a pity he couldnt have
lived and had the credit for the discovery

  it was a couple of days after this conver-
sation that a great white light suddenly burst
upon me investigation disclosed that the
fire that destroyed scanlons laboratory had
occurred on the same night that sawr--the
final disappearance of lorens cabin a
few days later i took time to make a trip
north i found as i had expected that
the ruins of the laboratory were only half
a dozen miles from the site of lorens camp
his choice of this isolated location had evi-
dently been due to the fact that it was the
intersection of three cross-state trunk power
lines it was undoubtedly this fire that
loren and i had seen that night

  these facts at last enabled me to form
an explanation of the puzzle that had gone
unsolved for  years i think i know now
pretty much what happened

  as i may have mentioned previously
lorens cabin stood on top of a hill the
highest in several miles scanlons appar-
atus must have produced a beam of some
sort which either by accident or design
was so pointed that it just grazed the top of
the hill before passing out into space the
beam had the property of causing objects
that it encountered to vibrate at such an
enormous frequency as to produce in these
objects an infinite fitzgerald contraction
the cabin and its contents were of course
thus affected

  now an object to which this happened
would not be destroyed it would still re-
main a real material body but-it would
no longer have three dimensions but only
two

  now it is obviously impossible for a two-
dimensional object to exist in a three-di-
mensional world and i believe that the
cabin was instantly translated into a part
of the universe where it is possible for a
two-dimensional body to exist as to just
how the act of transportation was accomp-
lished i have no idea but it must have in-

the ovoid vessel its gi-

ceivable speed toward the cloud-wrapped
earth the space ship-for such it was-
seemed a veritable
comet as it entered the
boundaries of the solar
system gliding through
the emptiness on the
wings of its own ac-
cumulated momentum

yet large though it
was its bulk was
dwarfed by the majes-
ty of the huge planets
of the outer ring which
illumined the black-

  as it neared its des-
tination a series of
quick soundless ex-

tubes in the bow of the

flame shot out into

momentum of the craft

unceasing cannonade

the outer hull-a thick
alloy of beryllium steel
and chromium-began
to glow dully as it
heated from the fric-

  eventually the craft
slowed its headlong
pace and settled into a
regular orbit about the
planet many times it circled the giant ball
in an ever-decreasing orbit as the speed grad-

out of this chariot and have a look around

  one thing sure verne offered people
wont believe half what we tell them about
our trip not that i blame them either
he added

  nor would it be remarkable if the story
of their adventures fell on skeptical ears
for they were returning from the strangest
adventure man had ever undertaken and
this in an age when man-newly conscious
of his freedom from the grip of his native
planet-had wandered about the solar sys-
tem at will but these two in a ship far
exceeding anything previously known in
power and cruising radius and undreamed
speed had gone far beyond the boundaries
of the solar system-be-
yond even the universe
itself

  toward the southern
cross they had flown
seeking the answer to the
riddle of the coal sack

-that great dark pitch in
the heavens where no
stars shine and the black-
ness of empty space seems
almost tangible they
had found it-a wide cur-
tain of blackness filling
the heavens at that point
for a space large enough
to hide a dozen solar sys-
tems of greater size than
their own through the
curtain they had hurled
their ship through thick blackness in which
the latent electricity and the cosmic rays of
two impinging tangent universes intersect-
ing at that point struggled for supremacy
hurling back from their whirlpool of force
even the light rays that sought to penetrate
this cosmic veil

  the two earthlings in their man-made ship
had won through at last the ovoid with
the cumulative momentuum of its long jour-
ney plunged into the infinity of darkness
although the struggle in the black whirlpool
threatened to disrupt the very atoms of it
and the earthly intruders it bore their
chronometers their radio the lights and even

the greater portion of the controlling mech-
anism of the ship had been destroyed or
warped and twisted out of all usefulness it
was only after great effort that they were
able to continue having repaired the latter
after a fashion with the materials which
were available

nce beyond the coal sack they had
found themselves in a new universe a
firmament of colorful mighty suns blazing
with all the known hues and others that they
could not name around many of the suns
swung great planets circling at a leisurely
unhurried pace as they glided through the
placid heavens of the strange universe they
felt a pleasant lassitude creep over them

their craft no longer hur-
tled through the sky at
its former mad rate as it
had before they had
plunged into the mael-
strom of darkness nor
did there seem the need
for speed

  they had landed on
one of the strange plan-
ets called by its own in-
habitants karaku which
encircled a great blue
sun here they had found
a pleasant and hospitable
people far different in
physical and mental
structure from the earth-
lings but who had made
them welcome

  on karaku with its habitable portion al-
ways toward the sun there had been no
time the sun was always overhead and the
period of the planets rotation was so long
that though the karakuans lived to fabulous
ages showing no changes as the lime
passed there were none alive who knew
when their world had last completed a trip
around its orbit so having no means of
measuring time they did not measure it
at all but lived their placid uneventful
lives completely oblivious of such a prop-
erty nor did any but the earthling mourn
the lack of measurements things moved
so very slowly in this new universe that even

garth bentley
beyond the star curtain



the two strangers did not worry long about
a thing that had no existence

  but the people of karaku although pleas-
ant and intelligent were not human beings
and the thoughts of the two men turned at
last to the planet of their birth in the
timeless world they had no way of know-
ing whether they had been gone years or
centuries there had been no physical
change in their bodies and they had drifted
into the easy effortless life of karaku al-
though even their thoughts seemed to move
slowly at last they began to feel the de-
sire to see creatures of their own kind even-
tually they took their leave of the hospita-
ble planet hurtled somehow through the
dark veil and after again repairing the dam-
age to their controls brought their craft
at last to earth

  derek who had risen from the bunk
where he had been indulging in a short nap
moved to the side of the ship and pressed
his face to one of the fused quartz ports
for some time he stood looking out upon
the scene while verne drowsed in his ham-
mock then at last he turned to his com-
panion

  it doesnt look like any place that i ever
saw before he remarked the sky is
still hidden by the clouds but its getting
light enough to see things a bit suppose
we start moving

  verne rose from his perch and joined him
outside the ship stretched a meadow of
rank swamp grasses reaching in places
halfway up the side of the craft hemming
them in on all sides stretched the dark green
fronds of jungle growth the tall trees
their tops like umbrellas high in the air
were strange and unfamiliar some of them
showed freshly broken tops where the space
ship had plowed its way in landing and al-
ready the broken edges of their trunks were
beginning to blacken verne considered the
landscape for some moments without speak-
ing then he whistled shrilly	v

  say derek you dont think we could
have missed our aim and landed some place
else do you this looks a lot like venus
to me

  it does that but this is the earth all
right dont you remember the moon-just

before we dived through the clouds theres
no mistaking sister luna among all the
other moons of the universe

  but theres no vegetation like this on
earth verne protested waving in the gen
eral direction of the port through which
he had looked upon the strange pulpy trees
the tangled creepers and the fleshy fungus
not even in the jungles of the amazon can
you find stuff like that growing and by
rights we should be well up in the north
temperate zone-somewhere on the north
american continent

  derek scratched his head

  im afraid what you should have said
he replied slowly is that there was nothing
like this growing on the earth while we liv-
ed here

  what do you mean verne asked anx-
iously something in the big englishmans
voice conveyed more than mere words could
have done

  how do you know how long we were
gone we spent our time on a strange
planet in an entirely different universe
probably in a different time dimension or
in one where time wasnt a dimension at
all we know it took us years to reach the
black curtain and the lord knows how long
to return from it and how long we spent on
karaku as far as we were concerned
time stood still while we were there neither
one of us seemed to get a day older after
we broke through the dark spot if you ask
me i think a good many thousand years
have passed since we last saw earth per-
haps millions

  impossible

  maybe but theres the fact that every-
thing is relative-even time my own opin-
ion is that we passed through another di-
mension where time just didnt exist

  but what makes you think we were away
so long the scenery

  partly derek replied but most of
all the stars remember the big dipper
while we were snorting around the planet
before landing how it seemed to have
been pressed all out of shape back in

before the changes could be noticed the
fact that they have visably changed posi-
tion proves to me that a great many cen-
turies have passed

  then verne remarked only half real-
izing the import of his friends statement
that means everybody we ever knew or
heard of has been dead for a long while
more than that derek replied grimly
im only hoping we will still find human
beings on the earth at all

chapter ii
the thing in the tree

tt other people left on earth surely

  ll	the human race cannot have disap-
peared entirely granting even that a long
time has passed verne was emphatic
in his denial

  oh i dont believe that the race would
have died out of itself but you can see for
yourself the climatic changes that have
taken place the earth has evidently got-
ten much warmer to judge from the tropi-
cal foliage and if the change was sudden
whether it came from conditions in the cen-
ter of the earth or because-which is more
likely-the earth has been drawn closer to
the sun humanity might have been wiped
out before mans intelligence showed him
a way to conquer his new environment or
if the change came gradually over a period
of many thousands of years humanity may
have evolved in various ways to meet the
new conditions people may be nothing like
the men and women we knew human
beings may no longer exist

  i still cant believe that weve been gone
so long although all of the evidence points
to your being right verne sighed now
that were back it seems to me that it was
only yesterday that we left

  it does seem like it derek admitted
while we were on karaku we were under
a different set of influences and time didnt
count but now were on our own world
and each day we get one day older for
father time is back in the saddle and well
have to get used to his hard riding the
fact that we sit here so contentedly philo-

sophizing with a whole new planet to ex-
plore proves that we havent entirely shaken
off the karakuan influence lets get go-
ing

  he rose and strode over to the mechanism
which controlled the doors

  ih going outside and see what its like

coming

  sure but wait a minute ive been in
jungles before and well need something
besides our bare hands particularly if we
go far

  from a locker verne drew two of the
strange metal swords that they had brought
with them from karaku where the inhab-
itants-although essentially peaceful-con-
sidered a sword a necessary part of the cos-
tume they were wicked looking weapons
and could prove very useful where the vege-
tation was heavy the long thin blades
were broad at the top tapering down toward
the jeweled metal handles and giving the
appearance of long thin inverted triangles
they were made of a metal unknown to
earth light as aluminum but able to shear
through an inch plate of steel when wielded
by strong men

  theyll make pretty good mchetes
derek admitted besides theres no telling
what we may meet in a jungle like this
there may be snakes in those bushes

  together they swung out through the
outer door of the hull and jumped lightly
to the thick spongy grass below the hu-
mid steamy atmosphere was like the inter-
ior of a turkish bath even in their light
garments their bodies were drenched with
perspiration before they had taken a dozen
steps through the safe muggy turf verne
bent low examining the sod

  derek he exclaimed do you know
that this is were walking on its moss-
moss a foot and a half thick

  they came to the edge of the little clear-
ing and plunged into the forest hacking
their way with the razor-edged swords it
was a jungle unlike any with which they
were familiar in many ways it resembled
the swamps of colorless growths that cov-
ered the twilight zones of venus yet the
flora were more nearly akin to that of the
old earth the thick undergrowth of shrub-
beyond the star curtain



bery was a weird mixture of plants grown
unbelievably large the occasional trees
they came across were lighting a losing bat-
tje against unclean parasitic growths that
covered almost every inch of the stems and
branches drawing their sustenance from the
lifeblood of the trees great toadstools and
mushrooms reared their umbrella tops on
thick fleshy stems to the height of trees
giant lianas drooped and festooned them-
selves from the branches of weedy plants
incredibly tall slimy and evil smelling
mold and dank moss covered the ground
and everywhere was the overpowering fetid
smell of decaying vegetation

  it was only by the greatest effort that
they attained their objective-a giant acacia
tree upon a little knoll that somehow seem-
ed to have defied the choking grip of the
parasites verne swung himself up into the
branches and climbed steadily to the top
as far as the eye could see the jungle
stretched unbroken through the powerful
k-glasses he could see a purple haze far
to the north that seemed to promise the pre-
sence of mountains

  he began to descend swinging himself
rapidly down through the branches half-
way down his foot slipped from its hold
on one of the stems to save himself he
grasped the first thing at hand-a dead
limb about the size of his arm as it came
away he felt barbed legs fasten themselves
to his arms and his body as the limb-
now very much alive-clung tenaciously to
his clothing slipping dropping from
branch to branch his clutching fingers try-
ing vainly to grip the tree he plunged with
his antagonist to the ground below the
jointed horror struggling but like verne
half-dazed waved long antennae aimlessly
in the air

derek at whose feet verne had fallen
leaped forward his weapon poised
carefully the thing raised itself from the
struggling man a creature out of a drug-
ridden nightmare dereks blade cut
through the air with a vicious slash and the
horror its body neatly severed fell to one
side the long legs-unbelievably thin-
kicking feebly

  verne rose from the ground slowly
what was it derek he asked shaking
his head as if to clear his dazed brain by
the gesture i slipped and grabbed hold
of the nearest branch and then the next
thing i knew the branch had pulled away
and was fastened on to me with all kinds
of arms and legs

  derek was examining the dead monster
with interest

  remember when you were a boy you
used to see funny twig-like bugs on bushes
and old trees  walking sticks we called
them they were jointed just like a bam-
boo cane and when they were on a dead
limb you could hardly see them unless
they took a notion to move they were
about the most perfect examples of natural
camouflage among all living creatures
sure i rerhember them but the ones
i used to see were only about three or four
inches long while this one is almost five
feet long and is as big around as my upper
arm

  this is probably the grand-daddy of them
all but theres no mistaking the breed they
are all harmless leaf-eaters he paused
and looked about him anxiously do you
know verne im getting just a bit wor-
ried

  why this fellows dead enough and
as you said his kind are harmless

  im not worrying about him hes done
and walking sticks arent numerous even in
a bugs paradise such as the world seems
to have turned into but if he could grow
to such a size-what about the rest of the
insect tribe

  maybe he was just a freak-or some new
species

  maybe but while you were up there
in the tree i saw some queer looking birds
flying around here-birds with six legs one
of them came close and instead of a bird it
turned out to be an ordinary ichneumon
fly-the size of a cock pheasant and-
look up there- he broke off to point
above the trees

  at first verne thought it was a monoplane

the ordinary u s variety is called diapheromera
feviorata these insects belong to the pliasmidae of the
order of orthoptera


wonder stories

soaring high in the air there was the long
slender body of the fuselage the wide ex-
tended wings then it swung lower and he
saw it for what it was-a great dragon fly
skimming the higher levels of the forest
on its way back to some stagnant pool in
the depths of the junble

  by common consent the two turned back-
ward toward the plane they said little
about the creatures they had seen it was
all too incredible-this new climate of the
earths and its effect on the insect kingdom
it would require time for their minds to be-
come adjusted to the new conditions as
they walked along over the way they had
come-where the rapidly growing fungus
was already replacing the growths they had
cut from their path-verne mentioned the
mountains he had seen through the glass

  at least they looked like mountains he
said but from what ive seen so far i
wouldnt bet on it theyre several hundred
miles away at least if we want to get to
them wed better take the ship we couldnt
make more than five or six miles a day on
foot

  there werent any signs of human habi-
tations were there towns houses or even
smoke

  no not a sign but this atmosphere
is so thick and steamy that the range of
vision is pretty limited even with the glasses
over to the right of us i saw a place where
a fog of mist was rising but im pretty sure
it was only a swamp

  lord what a fine homecoming derek
grinned remember how we wondered
what kind of an official reception wed get
from the people in the old home town and
now look where weve landed we dont
know where we dont even know when my
vote is to go back to karaku the people
there werent exactly humans but they were
better than bugs in a stinking swamp or
we could get in the old tub and go cruising
around until we find a planet peopled with
humans

the green monster

tte may have to verne agreed but
 v then we havent enough power to

take us to karaku or to go cruising around
theres just about enough to get us out of
the planets range of attraction with enough
in the forward tubes to allow us to land
somewhere safely venus would be our only
hope and its probably worse than this it
was bad enough in the old days with its
slimy worms and dripping forests and the
people always gave me the shivers with
their dead fishy eyes

  besides he continued i cant believe
that there arent any human beings left on
earth at all the human race is pretty
tenacious when it comes to surviving under
all sorts of adverse conditions im for hit-
ting north towards those mountains its a
cinch that if any people are left theyd
make for the polar bear country lets
have a lopk anyway

  its all right with me derek agreed
after weve come all this way to get back
home i think id just as soon have a little
more of a look around after all this may
be only a dirty little patch on the earths
surface if we can just get the ship up
off the moss-and i think we can even if
we havent got an incline-we can use
minimum charges and coast along a bit
until we spot your mountains

  they entered the ship together in a
few moments from the lower stern tubes
came explosions of flame and sharp de-
tonations of sound the great ovoid quiv-
ered and wrenched at the clinging moss
the air was black with weird and unknown
insects disturbed by the waves of unac-
customed sound swarming up from the
dank green depths the ship rose with a
jerk pitching and tossing as they maneu-
vered it over the ground until the bow
pointed northward then there was a sud-
den roar the stern tubes belched smoke
and flame and the ship flashed in the air

  at minimum speed the rocket ship swung
northward in a series of great parabolas
unequipped as it was with wings-except
for the two stabilizing vanes on the sides
of the craft-and lacking propeller or rud-
der the two men were forced to depend
entirely on the tubes to guide their vessel
as well as to propel it and keep it aloft
but when not at the controls they found
beyond the star curtain



time to study the country as they passed
over it

  it was an utterly strange land to both of
them everywhere stretched the seemingly
endless sea of rank vegetation broken here
and there by small bare patches or spurs
of naked rock above them lay the thick
blanket of clouds that shut off all sight
of the sky and made a definite ceiling for
the murky humid atmosphere occasion-
ally the forest gave way to broad rivers
sluggish and muddy or to steamy semi-
stagnant lakes whose surface was often dis-
turbed by uncouth weird forms apparent-
ly the same power which had given added
size to the insect world had also operated to
the enlargement of those hideous simple-
celled inhabitants of the warm pools crea-
tures which mark the boundary between
the plant and animal kingdoms

  on some of the pools they saw great
water bugs gliding over the surface like
catamarans and near all of them they saw
the hordes of the great dragon flies large
black flies and other strange winged folk
rose in clouds from the fungus growths of
the forests disturbed by the flaming thun-
der of the tubes as each fresh discharge sent
the ship on another stage of its curving
flight

  in one spot they disturbed myriad bird
grasshoppers huge insects grown to the
size of eagles that blackened the air with
their numbers as they rose from the strip
of forest they had been devastating
through the glasses verne-who was at
one of the windows-could see plainly the
blunt armored heads and thoraxes the
powerful jointed legs and the crushing
mandibles bathed in the dark brown se-
cretion he had once called terbacker
juice in the bygone days when he had
captured their tiny cousins to bait his fish
hooks

  they reached the mountains within a
few hours and found them little more than
rock hills covered as was everything else
by the dense vegetation no sign of human
habitation met their eye but while they
were looking for a place to bring the ship
to rest derek saw-still farther norlh-a
thin pencil of smoke a short blast from

the rockets and the falling ship again re-
sumed its course a few seconds later the
firing of the forward tubes brought it to an
abrupt halt and it crashed into the under-
brush bordering one of the small bare
patches verne thrown off his balance by
the force of the landing cl imbed to his feet
rubbing his shoulder

  nice gentle way you have of landing this
crate he remarked in an injured tone
thats twice in the same spot

derek turned away from the controls-
grinning

  this old lady wasnt built for a pleas-
ure ship to go cruising about the planet it
was meant to head off in a straight line and
keep going out there-he waved a hand
toward the clouds-you can slow her up
for a million miles or so ahead of your
destination here weve got to stop in a
hurry or wed be half way around the
globe besides the distance of that smoke
was deceiving i thought it was a lot far-
ther away

  they left the ship and swords in hand
started across the ground the going was
not easy through the thick moss but they
finally reached the spot where the dying
embers of the fire were sending out a few
feeble flickers it was an ordinary smudge
of the type used to discourage the insect
pests of the forest but this was not the
thing that most interested them-though the
fire itself told of the presence of human be-
ings two small tents made of a strange
cloth interwoven with metal threads stood
close to the fire with quickened steps they
moved closer to inspect the tents for occu-
pants when the humming silence of the
jungle was broken by a shrill scream

  the two men stopped transfixed it
came again a piercing shriek of terror
feminine and not far away they turned
and dashed in the direction from which the
sound came hacking their way through the
tangled forest that sought to bar them a
third time they heard it this time close by

  they redoubled their efforts and slashed
through the last barrier into a second small
clearing

  three figures in the very center of the


wonder stories

space stood posed in an unforgettable tab-
leau there was a girl young and pretty
with her pale skin and with her dark hair
falling in a loose mass over her shoulders
shrinking back in terror and there was a
man a white-haired man who stood as if
hypnotized his hands gripping a long
wooden spear staring at the thing that con-
fronted him

  it was this creature that drew their atten-
tion it was huge-almost seven feet high
wide delicate wings pale green in color
trailed like misty veils from the slender
body which stood supported on four wiry
legs its head ratlike except for the
great insect eyes-out of all proportion to
its other features-was a hideous carica-
ture surmounting a thin neck the two
great forearms were hugged close to the
breast folded up in a perfect attitude of
prayer with its devout pose and the fairy
delicate wings it seemed an angel from a
weird green heaven come to serve the
bidding of a bizarre diety of a far distant
planet it stood its neck slightly bent over
the supplicating forearms and its gaze on
the petrified man before it derek grasped
yernes arm in a grip that hurt

  what is it derek the latter demand-
ed it looks like a ghost

  its worse than a ghost its an insect
devil grown to a terrible size a praying
mantis come on he broke off and start-
ed across the clearing on a dead run his
sword gripped in his hand verne follow-
ed closely

  but their haste was in vain before they
had crossed but a few yards a sudden trans-
formation came over the green creature
from a praying angel it became an aveng-
ing devil with a suddenness that took the
breath away the wings spread to the full-
est extent standing up like parallel screens
of transparent gauze the end of the flex-
ible abdomen began to curl and uncurl
swinging backwards and forwards between
the four supporting legs with a swishing
sound like the hiss of a gigantic puff ad-
der the upper portion of the slender body
rose to its full height on the straddling
under legs the praying forearms opened

wide in a horrible embracing gesture the
murderous barbs and the sharp claw-like
talons outspread

  the two men shouted vainly to the doom-
ed human trying to break the spell the
weird terrible creature seemed to have
cast upon him he did not hear them or if
he heard he did not heed their cries of
warning but continued to gaze spellbound
into the blazing opal eyes of the creatures
darting head 

  then it struck quicker than thoughtv
the forelegs whipped forward the sharp
talons gripped the man and drew him ruth-
lessly to the green breast he shrieked in
terror as one barbed forearm held his body
to the creature in a cruel crushing vise
the cruel head bent swiftly forward as the
other forelimb bent the mans head down-
ward then the narrow snout of the man-
tis buried itself in the taut neck of its vic-
tim severing the nerve ganglions and crush-
ing the vertebrae

  totally ignoring the hysterical girl and
the two men rushing toward her the mantis
prepared to enjoy its ghastly meal derek
reached the creature first stabbing wildly
with his blade at the huge terror he
sheared through one of the under legs
cleanly his blade burying itself in the
creatures soft abdomen it dropped its vic-
tim and wheeled to meet this new attack
assuming its terrible fighting pose derek
looking into the creatures eyes seemed to
feel a queer paralysis creeping over him

  he saw the great forearms distended
raised to strike but the creature was ham-
pered greatly by the missing leg and the
deep wound in the abdomen its move-
ments were sluggish as it moved toward
him he tried to shake off the fascination
of the peacock feather eyes to break the
spell that held him he saw the creature
towering above him then verne was on
the creatures flank his sword swinging

	there is much speculation among entomologists con-
cerning the reason for the mantis pose many natural-
ists believe that this blood-thirsty insect mantis ltelig-
iosa of the otherwise vegetarian family ortljoptera
possesses the power to hypnotize its prey and that tho
pose is a part of its hypnotic process crickets which
flee from the slightest sign of danger will stand mo-
tionless while the creature kills them the mantis is
the insect tiger attacking anything and devouring its
prey alive it frequently devours its own mate during
the act of mating
  beyond the star curtain



a flash of cold metal and the mantis head
flew from its slender body

  derek shuddered as the green specter
sank to the ground close to the body of her
former victim the great wings still flut-
tered and the legs moved fefebly but the
creature was undoubtedly dead they
turned from it to the girl who was sobbing
over the body of the dead man

loma

even in her grief at the death of her
father loma was beautiful her dark
eyes veiled with a mist of tears turned to-
ward the two men as they approached her
verne hungry for the glimpse of a woman
after so long a time among aliens stared
unashamedly and realized for the first time
what had pulled him back across the reaches
of space even derek hardened misogy-
nist that he was felt his heart warm to her
in her sorrow but the new conditions of
earth seemed to have bred a stronger less
sentimental race as if realizing the futil-
ity of her grief-or bowing to the inevit-
ability of death-loma soon dried her tears
crossed her fathers arms upon his breast
picked up the thin javelin which he had
carried and rose to meet them

  who are you who have slain the green
killer she asked in a language altered
greatly changed but still recognizable as
english

  they told her that they were two who had
been very far away visiting a far distant
planet in another universe they saw that
their explanation meant little to the girl
and it was only when derek wavd his hand
toward the heavens telling her that they
came from beyond the clouds that they
made their meaning clear a shadow of
disbelief fluttered across her face but she
made no comment other than to thank them
for delivering her

  it was not until long afterward that ver-
ne learned that neither she nor her people
the pitiful remnant of americas once proud
civilization had any conception of the uni-
verse beyond the clouds to them the can-

opy which kept out the blazing rays of the
sun was an impenetrable roof over a flat
world only a few had ever seen the sun
on the rare occasions when the clouds had
parted for an instant then it had seemed
the avenging destroyer from a world of fire
shrivelling the fungoid verdure and send-
ing suffocating clouds of vapor up from the
swampy earth none had ever seen a star
or realized the cosmic wonders that once
made the heavens a thing of beauty to
earths peoples

  where did you and your father come
from verne asked

  loma motioned toward the northwest
they live far from here she replied
many marches through the jungle my
father heard of other peoples living to the
south and we set out with a great expedi-
tion to locate them we travelled for many
days but ill luck seemed always to attend
us one by one our men were lost in the
depths of the swamps or fell in battle with
the insects some were stricken with the
shaking death  and as we had no medicine
they did not last long finally there were
none but my father my brother and my-
self while we rested by the fire which
we had built in a glade not far from here
he vanished when we lay down by the
fire he was there and when we awoke he
was gone leaving no traces i fear the
killer got him too

  perhaps he merely wandered away
verne suggested we may be able to find
him for you

  perhaps she agreed but they could see
that she had few hopes

  at least we can take you back to your
people derek promised you will have
to show us the way

  come then she turned to lead the
way back to the tents and the campfire
wait a minute

  verne could not bear to leave the body
of the man where it lay derek joined him
and together they dug a shallow trench into
which they placed the body reverently
loma watched in open eyed wonder as they
built a rough cairn of rocks over the grave

wonder stories

  do you not bury your dead verne
asked

  no she admitted we leave the bodies
outside and-they vanish do they plant
the dead in the earth in your city which we
sought so far

  loma had evidently ignored their own ex-
planation of their origin and had identified
them as members of the fabled colony her
father had sought deciding that it would
be useless to repeat their explanation they
continued to question her about her people
and her city while they plowed their way
between the fleshy stalks of the sulphur-
tuft forest the great hoods of the toad
stools towering forty and more feet above
their heads dripped moisture unceasingly
occasionally they encountered the fetid
overpowering odor of the foul stinkhorn 
and they made wide detours to avoid its
thick gigantic column going slowly it
took them some time to cover the ground
that the two men had forced their way
through in such a hurry only a short time
before

they reached the spot where the fire
had been burning finding it almost
out the tents were torn and trampled and
near them they found traces of great foot
prints from lomas description for she
guessed the intruder that had wrecked the
camp-they recognized the destroyer as a
giant beetle who finding the tents in his
chosen lirte of march had calmly demol-
ished them they were just a little thank-
ful that they had not been present when
the monster had appeared

  the space ship lay undisturbed where it
had come to rest half buried in the muck
and soft mud beneath the thin crust of the
turf loma cried out and drew back as
she saw the great vessel evidently mistaking
it for a new apd therefore terrible species
of beetle only after much coaxing would
she even approach its sides and both derek
and verne had to go in and come out of
the door a great many times before she
would consent to follow them inside

  once in the ship however her wonder

 phallus impudicus

changed to immediate delight at the dry
and cozy interior her intensely practical
mind immediately grasped its utility as liv-
ing quarters and she seemed to appreciate
to the full the safety it offered places of
sanctuary it seemed were few and far be-
tween in the world that she knew there
every strange creature was an enemy and
man-ill equipped as he was to fight a
ravaging nature that gave no quarter-
had only survived by matching his cunning
against the armored and weaponed insects
from what she had told them they guessed
that the people of her times lived in con-
stant terror of the creatures which had in-
herited the world

  the steaming swamps the fungus forests
and the stagnant scum-covered waters bred
millions of hostile creatures most of whom
esteemed human beings as dainty tidbits
it was an insect-ridden world a world where
the works of man had vanished before the
all-consuming dampness during the years
when man had been too busy with the prob-
lem of survival against ever-changing and
always unfavorable conditions to progress

  as a result humanity had slipped a long
way backward the people lived precarious
lives in the high caves they had hollowed
out of the mountains cunning of the mass
had given way to cunning of the individual
except when danger threatened the home
settlements it was every man for himself
-and a horrible fate awaited him who fell
into the clutches of any of the carnivorous
insects

  it was a terror-stricken loma who first
felt the quivering of the ship as derek at
the controls fired the forward rockets in an
effort to escape the clinging tentacles of the
mud which had gripped the nose of the
ship at last it shook itself free and when
it lay once more on an even keel the great
stern tubes spoke and the ship lifted itself
from the ground in a great swoop

  once her fears were overcome loma ac-
cepted this new means of transportation
with little difficulty with true feminine
logic she felt no wonder at whatever the
amazing minds of her companions might
produce after all she reasoned they were
merely men although rather good looking

especially the reddish haired one from
time immemorial woman has accepted the
finest gifts man could devise as the portion
justly due her-particularly if the man be
her lover-without thought to the greatness
or the strangeness of the gift

  to loma the great space ship which had
struck awe in the hearts of the dwellers on
strange planets was merely a handy vehicle
conveying her back to her own people and
she bothered little about the how or why of
its origin and purpose as she stood at
vernes side watching the green country
speed backward below them her mind was
far more occupied with the idea that her
companion was very much in love with her
stranger though he was and in her own
way she was not at all displeased

  they had flown but a little while when
there came an ominous sputtering from the
rear tubes derek investigated and when
he returned to the little cabin in the center
of the ship his face was very grave verne
noticed his expression and drew him to one
side

  whats the matter derek he asked
the fuel were almost out of it one
more discharge of the rear tubes will ex-
haust our supply completely

  how about the forward tubes

  they have only a little left and we will
need that to slow us up in landing plow-
ing through this soupy atmosphere has
taken an enormous quantity since weve had
to fight both gravity and air resistance
they were interrupted by a sudden shout
from loma that sent them rushing forward
to the window where she stood looking
through the glasses

  i think those are the hills where my
people live she cried pointing toward a
distant line of purple

  verne heaved a sigh of relief the ovoid
was already falling in the down curve of
the arc and the flight would end in a few
moments more but they could easily make
the rest of the way on foot it could only
be a matter of twenty-five or thirty miles
making due allowances for the deceptive
qualities of the atmosphere

  then the tubes gave a last coughing ex-
plosion and the ship began a long coasting

fall to the ground the forward tubes
belched forth their blasts as the nose of the
craft pointed to earth carefully gauged
the discharges slackened the ships speed
to a minimum and they made a safe landing
on the soft moss 	

the onslaught

refreshed by a short sleep and food
from the ships larder the three left
tie sanctuary of the vessel and began the
long trek through the wilderness toward
the mountain home of lomas people in
the comparative cool of the dawn they
made good time verne and derek with
their keen cutlasses hacked away the im-
peding lianas and thick grasses and cut
narrow paths through dense thickets of cal-
ocera viscosa sprung to imposing heights
from the rotting vegetation which covered
the ground loma armed with a light hand
ax helped as well as she was able but
before long in the depths of the jungle
they were forced to slow down their pace

  here great forests of bamboo-like
growths so thickly seeded that passage vas
impossible offten caused long and tedious
detours great puff-balls fifty to one
hundred feet in diameter frequently blocked
their path and after verne had disgustedly
slit one with his sword releasing a choking
cloud of spores they found it best to give
these mushroom monstrosities a wide berth

  all day they forced their way through the
tangled undergrowth pausing only for a
meal of food they had brought with them
from the ship when the mellow twilight
lengthened because of the light diffused
through the enclosing cloud banks warned
them of the near approach of night they
prepared to camp near the rock ruins of a
limestone hill not even the rocks it
seemed could long withstand the destroy-
ing damp erosion had taken its toll of
even the hardest substances

  underneath the projecting shoulder of
the cliffs they found some measure of pro-
tection against the voracious mosquitoes
which rose as the heat of the day moder-
ated these insects large as hawks and

terrifying with the weird whirring of their
wings were a true menace to life only
the fact that their natural enemies in the
insect world had increased proportionately
while the warm-blooded men and animals
from which they drew their food had al-
most died out prevented them from over-
running the earth as it was there were
plenty of them

  yet it was not long before they found
these monsters vastly preferable to their
diminutive ancestors though the mos-
quitoes were far more dangerous because of
their increased size one of them being able
to drain the blood from a human being
the loud noise of their wings gave ample
warning of their approach and their size
made them easy targets for the sharp
swords

  when the darkness had fallen and the day
insects began to give place to the huge
moths and night flying things they retired
to a light sleep leaving verne on guard
beside their fire they were all tnoroughly
tired for though they had come but a few
miles the labor had been exceedingly wear-
ying derek had offered to stand the first
watch but verne knowing his partner had
taken the brunt of the work during the day
would not hear of it

  he settled himself comfortably on a
smooth boulder covered with moss and let
his thoughts turn back to the old world
he had known but his day had not been
an easy one and in spite of all his efforts
he found his eyelids drooping he made
a heroic effort to rouse himself but his eyes
finally closed and he fell into a deep and
profound sleep

  he awoke to find himself being lifted from
the ground his body held in a vise-like
grip he tried to move to break away and
succeeded in loosing a cry which brought
derek and loma to their feet in alarm the
moon had evidently arisen and its pale light
filtering through the clouds made the scene
light with a silvery eerie radiance he
looked at his captor twisting his neck about
with difficulty and saw a horny horrible
head great eyes and two questing antennae
waving above him giant mandibles held

him in an unbreakable grip though the
pressure on his ribs was not altogether un-
bearable	

  he saw derek running toward him and
saw him strike at the monster the great
head that held him dropped from the thorax
and he fell heavily to the ground the
mighty jaws relaxed and freeing himself
from the grisly misshapen head he climbed
to his feet and retrieved his sword he
saw the headless body of his late captor
its six legs contracting spasmodically as
death claimed it

  then he heard derek call to him and he
saw loma and his friend surrounded by a
ring of giant ants the monstrous insects
fully six feet long and standing several feet
high were attempting to get within the cir-
cle of his flailing sword

verne hesitated but a moment before
throwing himself upon the nearest of
the monsters his sword sliced through the
thick armored body and the creature went
down the insects intent only on reaching
derek and the girl ignored verne as he
hacked at them from the rear- until only
three of them were left verne with a quick
thrust severed the antennae from the head
of the nearest one who deprived of the
most important of its organs immediately
withdrew from the battle stumbling aim-
lessly around as if entirely devoid of its
senses verne made for the next one but
the creature as if realizing that the battle
was lost turned and scuttled away at high
speed just as derek disposed of the last
of his antagonists

  together with loma the two men inspect-
ed their late adversaries the black gleam-
ing bodies many of them still squirming in
the pale moonlight were horrible in the
extreme like creatures out of some fantas-
tic purgatory they seemed perfect fighting
machines with their heavy horny bodies and
the cruel thick mandibles capable of crush-
ing the humans to pulp and the silent
cold ferocity with which they had attacked
the purposeful intentness of their fighting
marked them the real rulers of this new
existence

  wonder why the other one scrammed in
beyond the star curtain



such a hurry asked verne as they turn-
ed from examining their victims

  it was loma who answered

  that ant went for help she replied
we have evidently stopped near a colony
of them it will come back with many
others

  then we had better get somewhere else
in a hurry derek decided theres no
use sitting here waiting for trouble per-
haps if we can get far enough away they
will not pursue us

  but even as he spoke they heard the com-
ig of the ants this time there were hun-
dreds of them approaching in regular for-
mation the two men held their swords
ready and loma behind them gripped the
small ax

  looks like its goodby old fellow derek
said quietly we can keep them off for a
while but     

  maybe verne admitted we can at
least give them plenty of trouble hit for
their antennae theyre helpless if anything
happens to them he grasped his sword
tightly and took a few vicious cuts at the
air

  then the first wave of the attackers swept
up to them and they had no time for con-
versation they struck blindly wounding
killing maiming but ever the ants pressed
forward and still more came from around
the hillside by sheer weight of the attack
the three were pressed back against the
cliffs pressed back until they no longer had
room to swing their weapons but had to de-
pend on short chopping cuts that often
glanced off the armored heads of the in-
sects then they felt great furry legs sweep-
ing over them dereks arms were pinioned
to his sides by the mandibles of a giant em-
met and he saw its abdomen with its needle-
pointed stinger curving toward his body
he felt a rapier-like pain shoot through
him heard a scream from loma and vernes
voice curing loudly then he was gone

chapter iv
into the commune

he regained consciousness slowly and
found himself being carried rapidly

over the ground by one of the ants he
tried to move his arms and legs but found
them unresponsive out of the corner of
his eye for he could not turn his head he
could see lomas fluttering draperies and he
tried to call to her and found that he could
make no sound he did not see verne but
guessed that he could not be far away

  for some time they swung along going
uphill and down over the tops of huge fun-
gus growths and up the sides of unscalable
boulders he marvelled at his captors
ability to carry him so easily without paus-
ing to rest or shift the weight of so great
a burden then he remembered from an
almost forgotten course in zoology tlat if
ants were the size of men they would be the
strongest creatures on earth and he mar-
velled the more that he and verne and
loma had been able to withstand them for
so long as they had

  they came at last to where the path be-
came a definitely marked road which led
into the city of the ants the great hills
towered hundreds of feet in the air and
covered acres of ground at their bases
cone-shaped the great bulks seemed far
larger than any works of man than any of
the architectural wonders they had seen on
far karaku the dwellings were roofed
with stones giving them an appearance
of solidity which he felt was entirely de-
served nothing short of a severe earth-
quake could damage them

  they met numerous others of the great
creatures coming from the communes war-
riors like those which had captured them
workers major and the tiny workers minor
setting out to forage food for the larvae the
nurses and the ant queens no one showed
the slightest curiosity toward the captives
nor was there any reception accorded the
captors

  occasionally a soldier stationed along
the avenues challenged members of the par-
ty and there was a great deal of gesticulat-
ing and rubbing of antennae while the
guard sought for the identifying odor of the
communal hill the challenges became more

these ants had evidently evolved from the occidental
ants found in western united states which roof their
hills with pebbles stones etc

frequent as they approached the towering
entrance like the mouth of a huge cavern
at the base of the central dome but al-
ways they pressed onward and at last pass-
ed into the great corridor that led to the
inside of the commune

  for a long time or so it seemed to derek
they were carried through the dark stuffy
corridors of the commune as his eyes
grew more accustomed to the semi-darkness
he could make out the bare walls of the
avenue they were traversing and the end-
less corridors intersecting it at regular in-
tervals a continual stream of workers
passed them going toward the outside

  they came to the store rooms situated
far below the surface of the ground here
they were met by countless workers car-
rying eggs upward toward the higher cells
of the mound where the warmth of the outer
air during the daylight hours might hasten
the process of incubation derek marvel-
led that-the great mandibles capable as he
well knew of a bone crushing grip could
carry the eggs with so gentle a pressure as
to cause no damage-to the delicate shells or
their undeveloped inmates

  then they cdme to the rooms where the
nurses were caring for the queer help-
less larvae like human nurses in hospitals
these ant prototypes hovered over their
charges feeding them changing their posi-
tions they groomed the bodies of the lar-
vae as well licking them as a mother cat
licks the fur of her kittens in another huge
cells derek caught a glimpse of a great-
bellied queen mother surrounded by a horde
of her worker attendants

deeper in the commune they came to
other great rooms where workers and
virgin queens were attending the fungus
gardens in still others of the subterranean
chambers of the dwelling he saw workers
caring for the aphids-the domesticated
cows of the ant world great soft creatures
who accepted their grooming with every evi-
dence of pleasure

  at last they came to the tier of cells
where the worker ants were busily engaged
in storing food away into one of these the
three ants with their unresisting burdens

made their way while derek was specu-
lating on the probable fate in store for them
there the three of them were unceremon-
iously dumped on the floor and rolled to
one side thus their captors left them be-
side the bodies of huge beetles hornets of
great size and other insects which had some
how fallen into the clutches of the ants

  here they lay helpless for a long time in
the stench and smothering air of the dim
roof unmolested and to all appearances
forgotten they had become a part of the
communes emergency store of food and
would remain there until needed seeing
that verne was awake derek called to him
softly

  hurt fellow

  no but i cant move what have they
done to us

paralyzed us with their stingers and laid
us away in their icehouse until somebody
gets hungry or the food supply runs low
why dont they kill us and put us out of
our misery

  why should they care how miserable we
are even if it occurred to them to think of
it at all i imagine that they expected us
to die from the effects of the stinging but
we were just paralyzed you forget that
were dealing with insects now they dont
think or reason any more than so many
of the karakuan robots these bugs dont
consider us enemies in the sense we think
of the word when they bumped into us
we were pretty dangerous customers it never
occurred to them that we might not be forth
the lives it would cost to get us their in-
stinct told them to capture us and they did
it they would have kept after us until
the last ant in the tribe was dead but once
they had us stored safely in the hill they
forgot us

  after a long while during which he must
have slept derek heard loma calling to
verne

  verne she called softly oh verne
i believe that i can move my arm

  yes verne answered ive been feel-
ing little twinges in my legs for some time
how about you derek

  derek tried to move and was able to turn
his head slightly
beyond the star curtain



  i believe that the poison is beginning to
wear off he replied evidently it doesnt
have a permanent effect on human being
through our skins and our lungs i imagine
the stuff they shot into us was some kind
of a formic acid compound and while it
might have been fatal it wont have any
permanent effects

  the time passed with a slowness that was
maddening to the three unable to move
about it seemed that they had spent years
as captives in the commune but little by
little they gained the use of their limbs at
first they found their bodies sluggish hard
to control but as more time passed they
were able to move about the chamber as
the paralysis left them they began to feel
the need for food and water the men had
brought a supply of concentrated food from
the rocket but it was only a question of
time until they faced the alternative of
starving or helping themselves to the ants
gruesome stores

  their captors seemed to have had abso-
lutely no curiosity concerning their strange
garments or accoutrements nothing had
been taken from them even the great
swords stained with the life fluid of the
warriors had been left in the store room
with them clutched in the frozen grip of
their paralyzed fingers

  once more in control of their bodies the
three began laying plans for escape verne
who seemed to love a good fight for its own
sake was all for a bold attempt to cut
their way out of the commune derek on
the other hand remembering the swarming
thousands that filled the corridors between
them and freedom was in favor of more
tealthy measures eventually his counsel
prevailed and at length swords ready they
prepared to leave the prison that had held
them for so long

brains versus instinct

the lower corridors were comparatively
free from ants the occasional work-
ers returning laden with food for the store
rooms they avoided by dodging into near-
by corridors when possible when they
had no time for this the worker was mur-
dered in cold blood and the body placed in

the nearest food chamber once or twice
they met great males the phenomenally
stupid consorts of the ant queens these
were great hulking fellows unable to dis-
tinguish friend or foe dependent on the
workers fortheir sustenance and lacking the
fighting qualities of the workers and war-
riors these were calmly ignored by the
three fugitives

  for some lime they wandered about the
subterrannean catacombs hiding and flee-
ing and fighting yet always they made
their way upward toward the light of day
and each succeeding hour of freedom gave
them renewed confidence then one day
they met their first warrior ant and the
whole course of their plans was changed

  derek was in the lead and he stopped
suddenly as he came full upon a full grown
warrior turning from a side corridor the
ant halted abruptly and as derek held back
waiting for verire to join him the warrior
examined him closely with great near-
sighted eyes all the time the questing an-
tennae where as he knew the ants pow-
erful sense of smell is located went care-
fully over his body then as if reassured
by the examination the ant passed on leav-
ing derek frozen with astonishment

  verne and loma who had waited silent
spectators of the meeting for some hostile
move on the part of the warrior moved
quickly to his side

  why didnt the ant attack you they
asked breathlessly

  derek shook his head then to their in-
tense surprise he burst into a ringing peal
of laughter

  im just thinking of the time wc have
wasted he said if only i had remem-
bered what every student of entomology
knows we would have been free before now
ants depend almost entirely on their acute
sense of smell and on the instincts that
guide their every moment they recognize
their friends or enemies by smelling them
and we have been in this particular hill
long enough to have soaked up some of the
communal odor of this outfit that ant
may have thought i was a funny looking
worker but as long as her feelers told her
i was all right she believed them in prefer-


wonder stories

ence to the evidence of her eyes

  he broke off chuckling

  all this time we -have spent sneaking
down corridors and hiding out was purely
unnecessary he continued ants are the
wonders of the insect world marvels of in-
dustry and courage and living in highly
organized communities fyut after all they
are only insects and are ruled by instinct
rather than intelligence and whenever
blind instinct meets intelligent reasoning
brains always win out the very strength
of the ants is after all their greatest weak-
ness

  he grasped his astonished companions
by the arms and moved off down the corri-
dor

  come on all we have to do is to walk
boldly out of the hill and not an ant will
disturb us

  the ease with which they made their way
to the upper levels proved the truth of his
assertions the great majority of the ants
they passed busily engaged in the work of
the commune ignored them completely an
occasional soldier halted them momentarily
but always allowed them to pass undisputed
at last they met a file of workers bound evi-
dently for the outside since they were emp-
ty handed

  the three humans attached themselves un-
obtrusively to the rear guard of the group
and passed along the corridors henceforth
unchallenged it was a master stroke for
they might otherwise have wandered about
the labyrinthian ways of the commune for a
long time as it was they noticed the ave-
nues growing wider until they found them-
selves in the broad main corridor leading
to the entrance it was all they could do to
keep from running ahead to the bright open-
ing that marked the presence of light and
fresh air but they restrained this impulse
knowing that to give way to their desire
would invite unwelcome attention on the
part of the guards at the entrance

  following the unconscious file of work-
ers they passed beyond the confines of the
hill and not until they were outside the
limits of the community of stone roofed
mounds did they fail back and allow their
guides to go on without them

  many days later days filled with almost
miraculous escapes from death in many dif-
ferent forms days of creeping across clear-
ings and hewing their way through the jun-
gle of ferns and fungus they came to the
upper end of a valley set well among the
hills of the north here the fungus grew
less luxuriantly the undergrowth was less
dense and occasionally they found trace of
once familiar plants loma who was lead-
ing the way halted and turned to her com-
panions

  we are nearing the valley with me
you will be welcome

  her words were addressed to both of
them but her eyes were resting on vernes
face pleading with her family wiped out
on the ill-fated expedition of which she
was the sole survivor there was little to call
her back-although there were many young
men in her village who had looked upon
her in a way that told of love unspoken
if only she thought this young man with
the reddish hair 

  verne caught her glance and smiled his
heart leaping within him

  after all why not derek he said try-
ing to make his tone appear casual there
is no place else to go and they are probably
the last remnants of our own people we
came clear across space to find them there
is no reason for not going on

  derek nodded

  sure he replied i imagine they are
pretty primitive but then we can help them
out considerably perhaps in time we can
declaim part of the land drive off the in-
sects and establish a new civilization per-
haps we can even build space ships to carry
them to another planet  well do a
lot for them wont we partner

  yeah

  vernes voice was muffled for his lips
were pressed close to lomas dark hair
derek glanced at them and then turned
away he stood looking off down the val-
ley that sheltered the remnants of earths
people his mind busy with a golden dream
of future empire but vernes thoughts
were all of the present and the girl in his
arms

volved passage through a dimension un-
known to us that is the cabin travelled a
great distance probably hundreds of mil-
lions of miles through three-dimensional
space by moving a short distance perhaps
only a fraction of an inch through the
fourth dimension

  from a former official of the wisconsin
light and power corporation i learned that
huge quantities of current had been made
available for scanlons use between the
hours of midnight and one oclock daily
thus a few minutes after twelve when he
turned his apparatus on the cabin disap-
peared from its hilltop sight and was in-
stantly transported to the deserts of a re-
mote world an hour later when scanlon
shut off his beam it instantly returned on
that last night the laboratory must have
caught fire in the midst of the experiment
and in some unaccountable manner the ex-

tinction of the beam failed to recall the
cabin it was left marooned forever on the
far side of the universe

  the above is my explanation of the facts
which i have related obviously much of
it is pure speculation but i have checked it
carefully and it fits all the known facts i
have told the story to du cles and he agrees
that the hypothesis is at least highly prob-
ably it was at his insistence in fact that
i have written this account of my exper-
ience it was he who first pointed out to
me that if the explanation outlined above
is correct a way has been opened whereby
the human race may explore some portions
at least of the more distant parts pf the uni-
verse under his direction research has al-
ready begun with the aim of duplicating
scanlons apparatus the hope of enlist-
ing public support of the project has been
my chief motive in writing this simple chron-

       we saw the building vastly magnified it was full of people
  sprawling about in all manners of attitudes but everyone was
  dead
admittedly

      time-travelling is
 a subject for theoriz-
 ing admittedly also
 it is a subject full of paradoxes i have
 tried in the following story to deal in a
 necessarily brief fash-
 ion with such paradox-
 es as arose in the
 course of the narrative

 there may be others
 that i have omitted

 neither have i tried to
 deal with the aspect a
 future civilization may
 present to a visitor
 from today that is
 pure speculation some
 may say one thing and
 some another

   human nature being
 what it is however
 the chances are that
 civilizations will rise
 and fall as they have
 in the past that dis-
 coveries will be made
 and lost and made
 again that much i
 have suggested in pass-
 ing

   i have not enlarged
 on the mechanical side
 of time travelling the
 mechanics at least in
 theory are fairly well
 understood by all who
 like this branch of
 scientific fiction once
 assume that they can
 be put into practice
 and the rest is easy

 whether the subject
 has ever before been
 treated from precisely
 the angle i have taken
 i do not know

   i wrote simply to
 clear my mind of the
 one idea that i believe has never been elab-
 orated before-that time used must be ac-
 counted for to put it more plainly if i

after  years

       by the author of
       vandals of the void

 a s mr walsh states iis
    his foreword time trav- 
  elling is filled with inter-
   esting paradoxes that
  should provide endless
  mental speculation

    the ability of man to
  travel into the future or
  past and alter the events
  of either time are doubted
  by most of those who have
  given the matter serious
  thought to alter the fu-
  ture whose events flow
  from immediate happen-
  ings or the past that is
  gone is to kill altogether
  the sequence of events

     yet the newer science of
   physics seems to offer some
   hope that this might be
   possible we know now
   that events do not happen
   continuously but in jerks
   and spasms and that they
   do not happen in absolute
   accordance with cause and
   event but with the laws of
   probability although the
   interruption of a stream
   of events by the intrusion
   of something entirley for-
   eign like the invasion of a
   twentieth century man into
   the world  years
   ahead may strike us now
   as being impossible a fu-
   ture world may understand
   and accept it

wonder stories

low i hear the hum of traffic and i see the
movements of people many thousands of
them i know that i am somewhere in the
center of a city of eight million souls not
one of them realizes the doom ahead if
they did it would not matter they will
all be dead and gone long before it comes
to pass seeing that realizing this my
story seems well-nigh incredible even to
myself who went through it all

  i can hardly expect to be believed at
times i can hardly credit it myself but
for two things i should end by fancying
that i had dreamed it all that i had been
a victim of some particularly vivid night-
mare but no dream no nightmare could
possibly linger with its
details so sharply etched
in my mind and as i
say there are two things
left me from that time
two proofs if ono can
call them that my exper-
ience was not altogether
the product of a disor-
dered mind why such
an adventure should have
come to me of all men i
cannot say it came-
that i all-and i must
record it as best i can

  my name it is johti
harling my status that
of a real estate broker
surely a prosaic profes-
sion that much no doubt
is proof for the credibility of my tale my
clan is unimaginative we cannot invent
such tales but let that rest

  my story opens out-of-doors on a sum-
mer day in the third decade of this the
twentieth century i was to put it plain-
ly hiking dressed in the conventional cos-
tume for such a pastime my rucksack on
my back a staff in my hand i was mak-
ing for the crest of one of those deserted
paths of leafy surrey hills a way not yet
invaded by the ubiquitous london motor-
ist

  the crest of the rise lay before me i
had nearly reached it in my mind there
was forming already the pleasant picture

of a halt a drink and a bite beneath the
shade of the trees before i proceeded on
my way there was nothing then to tell
me that a million years would pass before
i drank or ate again unless that seeming
hint of thunder in the air had anything to
do with it

  abruptly i saw a flash lightning i
thought out of a clear sky at that and i
wondered why i had heard no peal then
on the heels of the flash some branches
crashed with a rending sound as though
some heavy object had torn its way through
them a lucky escape for me the light-
ning might easily have struck me rather
than that tree towards which i stared

then i rubbed my eyes
what i saw was so differ-
ent from what i had ex-
pected

  it might have been the
original fiery chariot
from heaven such was
my first confused
thought for even at a
glance i could see that it
was no vehicle such as i
was familiar with it
seemed much like an air-
plane minus the wings
yet there was a subtle
difference the body was
slightly stream-lined but
nose and tail were blunt
with a cluster of sinister-
looking tubes fore and
aft from these a thin golden vapor rose
in thin lazy wisps

  the machine itself-i could hardly think
of it as anything else-was of an odd kind
of metal weird and strange it was the
green of an emerald so that i might have
taken it at first to be some species of crys-
tal did not everything in me cry out that
it was metal i learnt later that such it
was the length of the machine was stud-
ded with bosses seemingly of quartz port-
holes windows perhaps doors their exact
function did not appear at the moment

  i stood and stared even then not quite
convinced that my senses had not played me
some strange trick then gingerly i reached
after  years



forward my staff the machine seemed real
enough it was solid to the touch more
daringly i tried it with my hand it was
warm to the feel yet not unpleasantly so

  a door opened in the machine a sec-
tion of the side slowly slid away into the
hull and i waited wondering what was to
be revealed i think i was more curious
than frightened and the one idea in my
mind was that this undoubtedly was a vis-
itant from some other planet to me first
of all men was to be given the privilege-
or the horror which i knew not-of meet-
ing the strangers as the door slid gently
open speculation after speculation raced
furiously through my mind i tried to pic-
ture a hundred different and alien forms of
life any one of which it might be my lot
to view

  i was wrong

one person only stood framed in the
opening a being in human form more
staggering still it was a girl call her
that though at a glance she looked more
mature a juno-esque figure clad in some-
thing that looked oddly like chain-mail it
was golden and it seemed to glow-a lit-
tle the head was bare though i saw she
held some sort of a helmet in one gloved
hand

  i am no weakling i am built if anything
on a large size without unnecessary flesh
but this girl was every inch as tall as i
though naturally better proportioned

  while one could count ten we stood and
stared at each other i take it that she was
quite as surprised at my appearance as i
was at hers each of us fumbling for words
adequate to the situation

  then she spoke it was a soft musical
voice in its way though it held an odd hint
of power that i did not like had she
spoken in some language utterly unintel-
ligible i dont think i would have been
at all surprised the fact that she was using
english of a sort-queer distorted and to
my ears archaic-was more astounding
yet it was not hard to follow one could
sense the drift of what she was saying

  actually she was asking me what year

this was i told her  she frowned
a little

  i have made an error an error in cal-
culation she said but a few years out
in a million is not so much after all

  a million i gasped then who are
you what do you mean where do you
come from i asked with a rush

  she smiled a little as one of superior
wisdom to a child

  i am leela zenken she said simply
and i have not come from anywhere-in
space but in time i have come from an
age a million years ahead of this

  in that thing i said taking a step
forward

  she nodded we were becoming more
intelligible to each other now our pronun-
ciations seeming less odd yes a time
traveller that is it but is not this lon-
don she stared about her at the green
trees

  i shook my head you are perhaps
twenty miles from the nearest part of
greater london i told her it doesnt
extend as far as this-yet perhaps in fifty
years-

  she did not wait for me to finish but
darted inside the machine was gone a sec-
ond and returned

  that is it she said breathlessly an
error fifty years out in time and thirty
feet in space in my day the land this
point is that much higher but you what
are you what do you do

  i told her briefly though at first she
did not understand the function of a real
estate broker she did at last she did not
seem so pleased

  i had hoped for perhaps a scientist
she was watching my face as she spoke
some passing shadow must have given her
a wrong idea of what was in my mind i
mean she added hastily i wanted one
who would not discredit what he cannot
understand

  it was all greek to me that some object
lay behind her words i did not doubt but
at the moment what it was was not apparent

  what exactly i said do you want
and what precisely is it you hoped to do

  her answer was evasive enough in one


wonder stories

sense i had hoped to reach the year
 she said my reasons- she waved
them aside unuttered perhaps because
they were no concern of mine it is a
strange world to me a strange time a
strange people but we seem to understand
one another if this had been  no doubt
you would have helped me

  one idea after another chased through
my mind after all even though it was
not  why should i not help her i
was young unattached no relatives no
one but myself to worry about    and this
was adventure of the sort one might never
come across again

  why shouldnt i help you now i said
greatly daring

  she looked me up and down you are
of the wrong age she said deliberately
i go fifty years ahead

  but the people of fifty years time should
not be so radically different from what
they are today i protested

  that is true i might after all    she
looked back again into the interior of the
machine thought a moment then come
she said

  i had little or no idea just what was in
her mind but i obeyed her invitation and
stepped inside no sooner was i in than
she touched a lever and the door slid closed
she touched another lever and there came
a roar of sound from outside

a miscalculation

ffltt hat are you doing i asked
  vv bluntly

  raising the machine she said calmly
i miscalculated before it has taught me
a lesson in the years the land has risen
if we went back to my own day we might
arrive to find ourselves thirty feet under
the earth in fifty years time who knows
but that we might come to rest inside a
building with disastrous consequences
then we are not yet travelling in time
no only rising it is better to do the
travelling in free air

  i see i bent over the bank of keys
and dials in front of her and tried to make
something of their arrangement but i

could not the theory of time travelling
i had read of vaguely the idea of time
like a river one could travel with the
current drift from source to mouth me-
chanically one could quicken ones speed
on that river beat the drift of the current
as it were the faster one moved the fur-
ther behind would be left the particular
patch of water surrounding the boat when
one startesd conversely the boat could
travel against the current

  that much admitting the analogy be-
tween the flow of time and the flow of a
river was clear enough the mechanical
means necessary to achieve this result were
a trifle more complicated her explana-
tion of it all was necessarily brief some
of it i grasped and some i did not in
many respects the science of her age was
couched in terms unintelligible to me

  she cut her explanation short are you
ready then please sit down she point-
ed to one chair and seated herself in the
other we will start our flight through
time not long only fifty years

  she leaned forward and set a pointer on
one of the dials then pressed a button im-
mediately beneath it the machine seemed
to behave crazily i had an impression of
walls whirling and dissolving and i fan-
cied i heard a stifled cry from the girl
then    nothingness

  i came back to myself abruptly with a
growing sense of strangeness a feeling that
all was not as it should be the girl her-
self had slid to the floor her head was rest-
ing against the back of the chair and her
eyes were closed from the look of her i
knew she was unconscious but whether she
had fainted or it was the result of the time
travelling i could not say the bank of
keys ahead of her looked oddly twisted
the glass stuff of some of the dials had
broken and everything looked crushed and
crumpled as though it had impacted heavi-
ly against something

  but the machinerys injuries could wait
i turned to the girl wondering how i could
revive her but she saved me the trouble
her eyes opened flickered closed again
then with an effort of will opened once
more and remained open
after  years



  she sprang to her feet with a little cry
the moment she got command of herself
glanced at the dials then rushed to one of
the porthole-like objects and stared through
it she remained there some time what
she saw i do not know but when she turned
back to me it was with an expression of con-
sternation on her face

  i have failed she said but the fault
is not altogether mine first my original
miscalculation then the jolt the machin-
ery received when i landed in your era
both together may have caused it

  tell me i said with a queer sense of
tightness about my heart just what has
happened

  she looked me squarely in the eyes and
-i liked this-though she felt the fault
was hers she did not flinch before my gaze

   it is this she said a trifle unsteadily
i am back here in my own age you with
me a million years ahead of yours the
machinery did not function as it should
have the moment i pressed the lever we
were shot with an extreme time velocity
back to the point from which i started
well i said for one age seemed quite
as good as another now i had taken to time-
travelling i dont see that it matters much
--as far as i am concerned

 but you dont understand she said
quickly with an edge of consternation in
her voice unless i can manage  to repair
thet machinery which i doubt you are
marooned in time a million years ahead of
your day that in itself might not matter
so much to you or to me were it not that
the very days of this earth which is the
home of us both are numbered is that
not sufficiently appalling for you

it was i sat down heavily and stared
at her unbelievingly for the moment
i did not know what to think the pros-
pect was too stupendous for me to take it
all in she left me to my thoughts

   in a little while i saw that she was open-
ing the door that led outside the machine
and she beckoned me to come with her

  but first she said you must put this
on it was a suit similar to the one she
was wearing designed i learned to pro-

tect the wearer against any extremes of cold
that might be met

  something of my numbed state i had no
doubt put down to the shock her announce-
ment had given me now i began to real-
ize that the air was cold almost like the
blast of a refrigerating chamber perhaps
the earth was passing through another ice-
age that may have been what she had
meant

  or perhaps the planet had tilted again
as it had already done more than once in
its history and the poles had shifted i
did not know i could only wait and see for
myself what had happened at least she
made no move to enlighten me then but
instead seemed all impatience to be about
whatever business she had in mind

  we stepped out of the machine i had ex-
pected to find myself in the open air but
instead looking up i saw we were in a
vast building made of some transparent
substance like glass the air in it was keen
almost icy and i looked in vain for signs
of life we two seemed the only human
beings alive

  the girl did not speak but merely mo-
tioned me to follow her we passed down
through the huge building to one part that
had been partitioned off into rooms since
they too were made of the same glass-like
substance as the rest of the building it
looked as though the divisions had been
made more for the convenience of work than
for the sake of privacy despite the warmth
given out by the electrically heated suits
we were wearing the girl shivered a little

  its colder than it was she said in a
low voice the power must be giving out
the heaters running down i pray nothing
has happened i have been away so
long 

  why what does it all mean i
asked

  presently she returned it is a long
tale i cannot tell it all to you now first
i must learn what has happened

  we came to a room the floor was bare
but the walls were covered with a profu-
sion of dials keys and plates not unlike
those of television screens she studied the
apparatus carefully for some seconds then


wonder stories

made some adjustments with switches and
levers one of the television screens glowed
to life i became aware that i was looking
at a vast building similar in some respects
to that we were in she made other adjust-
ments localized the view so to speak so
that we were looking at one particular sec-
tion of the building vastly magnified it
was full of people men and women dressed
after the fashion of the girl by my side
they were sprawling about in all manner
of attitudes but everyone of them was dead
frozen stiff the cold of space had crept
in and killed them where they lay

  an hour or more we spent there while
the girl searched one screen after another
the television eye roaming from one point
of our globe to another and always with
the same result nowhere on the whole
round of the earth was there life it was
a dead world

  at last with a little moan she turned
away then dropping abruptly to a crouch-
ing position on the floor buried her head in
her hands and began to sob woman to
the last after a million years the sex had
altered but little

  i caught her by the arm and raised her
a little roughly i am afraid but i felt she
needed to be shaken out of her bog of de-
spair

  tell me i said what has happened
i am still very much in the dark i think
it is time that i should know

  she faced me with burning eyes it is
all my fault she declared vehemently i
have been the last hope of my race and i
have failed    lamentably

  but how all may not yet be lost
perhaps i can be of some help not much
im afraid but the telling of your story
may throw a new light on something hither-
to obscure who knows

  i doubt it she said almost sullenly-
anger with herself-but it is right that you
should know i have brought you here it
is for you to judge me

a tale of doom

with that she started her tale making
it under the circumstances necessari-

ly brief some i understood of what she
said and some i did not remember in
many ways the science of her age was a mil-
lion years ahead of ours and again they
had forgotten many things we know

  a tale of a world suddenly faced with
the prospect of dissolution the solar sys-
tem swimming into some uncharted reach of
space encountered a stretch of unknown
substance a gaseous entity a hole in space
-no one seemed able to say with any de-
gree of certainty j ust what it was-that pos-
sessed the singular power of intercepting
the heat-giving life-giving rays of the sun

  then i interrupted it is not a case
of a dying sun the sun still lives

  she nodded look she said she
pressed a button one of the television
screens came to life i found i was looking
at the sky not materially changed from
that which i had known the sun was
climbing towards the zenith no smaller no
larger than i remembered it but it was a
sickly red in hue i could look at it with-
out hurt to the eyes i might have been re-
garding it through heavily smoked glasses

  go on i said i was beginning to un-
derstand a little

  she went on this unknown element a
substance with the power of shutting off the
heat of the sun in the same way that a lead
shield will cut off the emanations of radium
augured death for the earth time was
short from the day the fantastic proper-
ties of this unknown element had first been
discovered scarcely two years were left
before the curtain would be drawn complete-
ly between the sun and its family of plan-
ets

  the scientists of the world were mobil-
ized some suggested one thing some sug-
gested another none were of any practical
help in the million years that had passed
since my day secrets had been discovered
and lost again inventions made and de-
stroyed the story of human history was
the story of good things used not always
wisely there had been conflicts between
nations between the inhabitable planets
even civilizations had risen and had per-
ished a graph of human progress would
have shown a series of alternating peaks
after  years



and depressions old records that might
have been of use had been lost or destroyed
in one or other of the many conflicts when
the red lust of destruction had been let
loose

   it narrowed down to this in the end to
save humanity some means of replacing the
suns heat must be found the desperate
need spurred men on to further efforts the
while the glass-roofed cities were built in
the hope of staving off the final calamity
for years if all else failed old records
such as remained were feverishly searched
mention was made in them from time to
time of the discovery of a principle of atom-
ic energy light- and heat-giving if such a
thing could be re-discovered the world
would be saved for it was felt that the blot-
ting out of the suns power was only tem-
porary that in the course of time the solar
system would have passed out of the area
of malefic influence

   feverish work almost to no purpose

  leela zenken had her own ideas her
mind ran on the possibilities of time trav-
eling if she could construct a machine
that would take her back through the myr-
iad years she might be able to make con-
tact with one or the other of those men of
the past who claimed to have discovered the
principle of atomic energy for a time she
was laughed at

   time-lravelling was a theory then as now
the mechanical difficulties seemed insuper-
able but she worked away making this
experiment and that failing always yet al-
ways seeming just within measurable reach
of success and at last it came she dis-
covered the vibratory rate necessary to make
travelling through time a feasible proposi-
tion

   yet even then much remained to be done
she must search backward through time a
long and wearying process for the data on
which she had to work was meagre some
of the alleged discoverers of the power she
sought must have been charlatans since
there was no record of their discoveries ever
having been put to practical use an un-
thinkable thing had they done what they
claimed in this she overlooked one soli-
tary possibility

her search began she left her
world almost in despair so many
things had failed that they had little faith
in this last hope she came back through
time pursuing her enquiries the people
of other ages treated her badly she met
with incredulity contempt derision every-
thing fcut belief and help in some eras
she was even regarded as a mad-woman
once during one of the interplanetary wars
she was treated as an invader and barely
escaped without injury the machine it-
self was slightly damaged before she could
get it to start

  at length she came across one item of
information that looked explicit a scien-
tist in the year  had made the discovery
she sought his word had been doubted
he had been jeered at and when at last he
had succeeded in convincing the world his
experiments were regarded as too danger-
ous to be allowed to continue in a fit of
pique anger or because of broken hopes
-call it what you will-lie destroyed his
apparatus everything that would throw
any light on what he had done and ended
by destroying himself and his laboratory
that it seemed was what actually happened
though popular account had it that an exper-
iment had gone wrong

   the year of the great discovery
to leela it appeared that if she could
reach the man while he was in his first
flush of enthusiasm before he found his
invention and its possibilities ignored she
might get the formula from him might
even persuade him to return with her

  but the damage to her machinery had
thrown her calculations out of gear she
landed in my year as i have described
she could not face the prospect of travelling
alone again and the need for company was
what actually decided her to take me with
her

  several points made by no means clear
to her presented themselves to me

  all isnt lost yet i tried to console her
perhaps if you can repair the machine you
can travel back again find the man and set
your return for a date here before the
others have perished

  she shook her head one factor i


wonder stories

have overlooked she pointed out the
past is immutable i cannot go back and
change the order of things they have hap-
pened in a certain way i cannot make
them happen in any other the future
yes that i can influence events yet to
come are still in a state of flux the fu-
ture can be moulded but the past no to
make it clearer there is no record that i
ever reached that scientist of the year 
there is no record that i succeeded in my
mission and returned in time to save my
people therefore it is hopeless to try
i should have realized it before

  but you have taken me out of the
past i protested is that upsetting the
order of events

  again she shook her head no she
said somewhere it has been recorded-
you will find that-that you made this time
trip that you and i met if you had lived
your life without our having met i could
not have gone back and brought incidents
into that life that had never occurred you
understand

  dimly i said i fancy i see what
youre driving at but tell me why you
should have come back to your own era
and found you were too late i should
have imagined that you have been able to
have returned to the exact date you left
let me explain this is how it pre-
sents itself to me when i travel in time
the process is to all intents and purposes
instantaneous i do not expend time so
to speak in the way that i expend power
i do not live that time i merely pass
through it but when i reach any desired
era and stop travelling time begins again
for me i spent fifteen minutes stationary
in your year talking to you that is fif-
teen minutes out of your life-period and
mine you have that fifteen minutes less
to live

  my searchings through the centuries cost
me the matter of a year in accumulated
time outside of the influence of the time
machine that year also has gone out of
my life it is part of the allowance of my
existence that i have expended for in-
stance now i can see that i could not pos-
sibly have returned here to the exact date

on which i left the amount of time i
spent in other centuries when i was not
actually time-travelling amounted to a year
that year must be subtracted from the
sum of my existence therefore i arrive
back to find that a year here has elapsed
in my absence

nearing the end

       hen i said if i were to remain
x here a year and then could return
i would find it  not 

  that is it exactly she agreed then
looked at me with wide-eyed horror

  but she said slowly the machine if
broken

  you may be able to repair it there
is no harm trying

  she thought with knitted brows during
one long pregnant minute

  why not she said at length there
is nothing to stop your returning in that
case even if i cannot go

  you may be able to come with me i
suggested there is no reason why you
should not even what you have told me
does not debar you your life span is such
and such you must live the full period
allotted to you either here or in some other
era

  there may have been a flaw in my rea-
soning perhaps so perhaps not at any
rate she seemed convinced no doubt she
wished to be convinced also i was a man
and she was a woman not altogether re-
pugnant to each other and whatever else
had changed a million years had wrought
but little alteration in the fundamentals of
human nature

  at least she set to work with an almost
feverish haste but for my suggestion i
really believe she would have done as the
others let in the cold of space and die by
her own act reasoning it was far better to
pass out in a few moments of exquisite
agony than linger day by day each day
seeing the thread that bound one to life
grow frailer and thinner until at last it
snapped

  but i-i flatter myself-gave her some-
thing to live for nothing much scarcely
after  years



a worthy object no doubt but there it
was the human heart being what it is

  i could not help her she would not
let me preferring to work feverishly and
alone i occupied my time in various ways
i could not go outside the building in
which we were housed to do so would
have been to court the frozen death i had
my camera with me and i had a supply of
films and i would dearly have liked to
have taken many photos but i compro-
mised some of the television screens were
still functioning their power had not yet
drained and by their aid i secured some
photos worth preserving whether they
would be credited i could not say at
least as records they were worthwhile to
me alone

  daily the red disk of the sun grew more
dim and daily the cold increased the
glass surface of the building now was frost-
ed over so that it was opaque we began
to feel the chill bite of it in our bones
the power that warmed the building was
running out yet i was heartened by leelas
anouncement that a few days more would
see the repairs completed i could have
wished that she would let me help her but
every time i broached the subject she re-
fused my offer saying that it was work that
only one could do that it was intricate and
that with my lack of knowledge of the sub-
ject  would be more of a hindrance than
a help

  however i found much to occupy me
the building itself was a storehouse of
strange appliances i had wondered quite a
lot since i had arrived why the power that
warmed the building should have lasted so
long after the power seemed to have run
out in the buildings-one might almost call
them cities-that had once been inhabited
the answer was very simple it seemed

  the building was small compared with
those others we had seen on the screens the
amount required to warm it was not great
and since it was something in the nature
of stored solar energy it could be kept un-
used for quite a while leela as a matter
of fact had started the motors immediate-
ly after our arrival and only run them at
half-capacity since knowing there was no

way of replenishing the supply once it
was exhausted she had been careful about
that

  one discovery i made while her work held
her to the machine in one of the compart-
ments at the furthest end of the building-
one that we seldom went to since the cold
there was more intense-i discovered a
series of apparatus not unlike the switch-
board of a telephone system and exploring
further i found head-phones one day in
an idle hour i put on a head-set and snap-
pen one switch after another simply to see
what would happen great was my sur-
prise to hear a voice in my ear

  i nearly dropped the phones in my ex-
citement then recovered my equanimity as
i realised that i was listening to something
in the nature of a mechanical reproduction
a phonographic record or whatever corre-
sponded to it in this age

my idle working of the switches had re-
leased one that set the machine in
operation i listened to the end-a short
record it was-and then switched back
sure enough the voice metallic and meas-
ured began all over again i had paper
and pencil in my pocket and for reasons of
my own i took a transcript in short-hand
of what the voice was saying that finish-
ed i looked round the switchboard to see
if there was anything that would show me
where the voice was coming from

  there was much that i did not under-
stand but i was able to puzzle out enough
to realize that the record i had heard was
being transmitted from that building we
had first seen in the television screen prob-
ably it had been so adjusted that anyone
attempting to call the place would immedi-
ately set the machinery in motion

  i went back to leela in a thoughtful
mood the moment i reached her i could
see by her face that success had come at
last she had repaired the machine we
could start as soon as i liked the news
decided me to say nothing about my own ex-
perience yet on one point i must satisffy
myself before i allowed her to take the
decision

  leela i said are you prepared to


wonder stories

come back with me to my own age to stay
with me there always and never know a
life apart from me

  she looked at me oddly i thought
why she said do you ask that

  because i answered steadily i
would not care to think that you were doing
this simply to save me from being maroon-
ed here in time in the while we have been
together i have grown to think of you as
someone i would not care to have pass out
of ray life again you have brought some-
thing into it that it had never known be-
fore-love

  and you too she said softly have
brought it to me if i were not going back
with you i would not care what became
of me i have failed in what i tried to do
i have lost all my own world held for me
and had you not come to make up that loss
for me i 

  she did not finish but said abruptly
let us go before i begin to say foolish
things

  we went i think in one way she was re-
luctant to go for she shed an odd tear be-
fore she put her hand to the key-bank and
moved the lever that would bring us back
to this year of grace

  we arrived on the very spot where we
had taken off i made a careful calcula-
tion before we ventured out found that we
had spent two months and three days
away and satisfied of that we opened the
door and stepped out into the fall sunsljine
of a living world

  what will we do with the machine i
said as we turned and stared at it it
will be a bit difficult to explain away wont
it

  this she said answering my first ques-
tion ignoring the other

  i saw then that she held a length of cord
in her hand and that the other end of it
disappeared into the machine itself even
then i did not realize what it was she in-
tended doing abruptly she jerked the
cord it was twitched out of her hand the
machine itself rocked crazily seemed to dis-
solve and before my astonished eyes van-
ished utterly

  i totok a step forward and caught her by

the arm what have you done i cricd

  sent it back to my own time she said
it is better thus without it i will not be
tempted

  to do what she would not say

  that is three years ago we have been
very happy since no cloud has marred
the serenity of our lives yet sometimes i
fancy leelas thoughts go back-or for-
ward if you will-to the days that are yet
to come it has taken me all that time to
summon up courage to tell her of that last
experience of mine in what for want of a
better term i call the telephone room of
the building that was her experimental lab-
oratory to my surprise she took it better
than i had hoped

  they did not think you would return

i	told her they believed you had failed
and were lost in time but they prepared
in case you did come back there is the
chance that they were not dead that many
of them are but in a state of suspended ani-
mation there was a new discovery made
while you were away a drug somewhat sim-
ilar to that we call avertin it could sus-
pend animation completely over a short
period but whether its effects would be
lasting over years was problematical

  some of the population were willing to
try at any rate and were given the drug
from first to last it was all a pure gamble
you see a few of your scientists believed
that the solar system would pass out of the
region of this strange gas-call it that-in
a century or so but they admitted they
might be wrong the majority were almost
certain the earth was doomed they hoped
that if it was not that if this was but a
passing phase the warmth of the rejuvenated
sun would bring life back to those who were
in a state of suspended animation they
gambled on everything on the potency of
the drug its ability to protect against the
inevitable cold gambled on their hopes that
the sun would once again shine out as be-
fore

  nowhere was there any degree of cer-
tainty for they were dealing with excep-
tional circumstances and had nothing on
which to base their calculations other than
the hopes they had in mind
after  years



  no i do not blame you she repeated
at the end you did what you thought was
for the best had you told me then when
my mind was in turmoil i might have taken
a course that i would have regretted after-
words no i do not regret i am here with
you    

  but what else she said does not matter
nevertheless the fact remains that leela
has the knowledge and the means to build
another time machine and if she will to
send us travelling again we have discus-
sed the matter between us without reaching

any definite conclusion were we to go
forward again a century or so ahead of her
day we might find the world awakened
once more on the other hand we might
not it would be more than heart-breaking
to find at last a world locked in a slumber
that had become eternal while we do not
know for certain we can sustain our minds
with the hope of possibilities 

  yet i do not know some day we may
decide to build another machine take the
risk of black disappointment and solve at
last the enigma that perplexes us both

what has gone before

 t is the year  and garry parker is a new 

  york-berlin rocket pilot he is in love with naomi
daughter of henry of the fentons one of the five
rulers of the earth since garry is one of the billions
of enslaved workers and naomi is an aristocrat-of
the ruling class-they cannot marry naomi is being
forced by her father to marry sadakuchi son of
hokusai another of the five world councillors by
this alliance henry hopes to control a majority in the
world council

  naomi has but a week before her marriage she
and garry hope to effect some plan to evade it but
garry returning from a flight is ordered to another
part of the earth seeing his plans going astray he
refuses the order and as punishment is ordered to
be sent to an idlers colony a colony of rebel
workers in an uninhabitable part of the earth

  naomi learning of this tries to intercede with her
father but henry then orders a more drastic pun-
ishment for garry he it sent with a load of other
rebel workers to a mysterious island of the pacific
from which no workers have returned also on the

cargo is purtell a former chemist

  the workers are landed on the island which has
been supplied with the almost extinct cows and soil
for farming the workers have presumably been
condemned to earn their own sustenance here garry
is elected their leader against the opposition of jerie
farr he ascends the top of the island mountain to
investigate it and discovers a crater filled with 
poisonous gas-the level rapidly rising he realizes
now that the workers are to be snuffed out when the
gas overflows into their settlement

  at the suggestion of naomi who has stolen into
the expedition they strip the cows of their hides and
build coracles to paddle to the island of levis miles
away where there is a detachment of police they
overwhelm the police and steal a rocket liner the
gas is found to be a catalyzer for oxygen and a voy-
age to the moon is deemed possible with it because
they are outlawed on earth the exiles set off for the
moon on the way dore swithin one of the men
is blown unprotected into space and garry putting on
a space suit goes out after him

now go on with the story

garry swore at himself what twenty
different kinds of a fool was he not to
have thought of a pocket ray-director how
was he going to find dore when split sec-
onds might mean death from horrible stran-
gulation

  and if he himself remained out here an
hour or so the glacial space-cold would
get him the chemical heat units had noj
been installed in the space suits all be-
cause he had not thought of the ray-direc-
tor

  already he had lost all sense of direc-
tion dore might be within arms length
yet he might as well have been light years
away any move he would make might
propel him irrevocably away from the doom-
ed man

  what a dilemma to be in here he was
floating in airless space feeling no weight
not quite sure whether he was topsy turvy
or upright he was seemingly at rest yet
in reality streaking along at a speed far in
excess of the fastest bullet what was he
to do

  he awoke from his inaction-set his teeth
together with a snap find swithin of
course after that-

  he snapped up the recoil pistol attached
to the suit and squeezed the trigger only
a certain tension followed by a feeling of
relaxation told him he had moved for there
was no air to resist his passage he might
just as well have been a disembodied spirit

  for what seemed hours he moved about
by the recoil shots becoming agonized in
his desperate anxiety something cried
within him-dore must be dead by now-
give up-turn around-try and save your-
self

a race with time

but an indomitable will carried him on
he must locate dore first as for turn-
ing around-which way was around

  what was that his enclosed hand en-
countered something his heart gave a
great bound was it swithin frenziedly
he grasped at the obstruction his hand
slid around it unmistakably the body of
a man a moment of fierce exultation fol-
lowed by realization the hody was limp
inert dore was dead

  nevertheless he clutched the invisible
corpse it was easy to move-both of them
were comparatively weightless

  breathing a fervent prayer garry shot
his way toward the ships bulk

  his free hand struck an obstacle it was
the ship he screamed in sudden hyster-
ical relief he had not realized how close
his nerves had been to snapping now re-
newed strength flowed through him

  holding swithins body in a tight em-
brace he edged his way along until with
a great sob of thankfulness he found the
edge of the open air-lock painfully he




wonder stories

dragged himself through fumbled for the
cold light switch pressed it the walls
sprang into a steady luminosity he swift-
ly shut the side behind him sprang through
the chamber slid open the inner door and
fell headlong into the bright light of the
hold safe at last

  the shouting jostling excited workers
crowded around him almost overwhelmed
him in their welcoming rush

  a slender figure
darted forth from the
milling mob threw
herself upon his en-
closed form it was
naomi tears stream-
ed from her eyes as
he called upon him

garry darling oh my
dear is it really
truly you i cant be-
lieve it thank god
you were spared

  garry could not hear
her tremulous words
but he guessed the im-
port of her moving
lips a wave of warmth
glowed over him for
this beautiful erst-
while proud aristocrat

  then he started the
deathly pale swollen
face of dore swithin
stared up at him with
closed eyes fever-
ishly he worked at his
helmet purty was
plunging through the
crowd like a battering
ram his freckled face
agleam with unalloy-
ed delight glory be
you made it garry

he turned fiercely at
the pushing people

the second installment
of this extraordinary
story brings us to some of
its most stirring phases
we have seen a brave band
of men on the way to the
moon to find a haven there
from the death or enslave-
ment that awaited them on
earth

   they are going to an air-
 less lifeless world where
 they must find a means of
 sustenance for themselves
 -air food protection from
 the extremes of tempera-
 ture

  our authors do not at-
 tempt to gloss over the
 tremendous difficulties that
 the exiles will face they
 have written so far as we
 know the first story of a
 colonization of the moon
 with its hardships por-
 trayed in a pitiless light

   it is quite possible that
 in the future such an at-
 tempt at colonization may
 be made and when that
 time comes the same ob-
 stacles must be faced as
 will confront our uexiles of
 the moon

pallor his limpness poor fellow he
said softly hes dead

   garry had ripped off his helmet flung
it aside for a brief moment he held naomi
close to him then he too gazed sadly at his
loyal comrade

   did all i could to save him but it was
too late

   i know you did garry bill protested
warmly

   how long was i out
there it must have
been almost an hour
eh

   purty stared at him
as though he had gone
out of his mind al-
most an hour he
echoed say man are
you crazy youve
been gone exactly-
he snapped his wrist
chronometer youve
been gone exactly four
minutes

  what garry
sprang forward seiz-
ed bills wrist with fin-
gers that dug painful-
ly say that again
hey what are you
trying to do break my
arm let go feller
what do you want
garry dropped the
offending hand but in-
sisted fiercely swear
it was only four min-
utes 

somewhat taken
aback at his partners
strange demeanor bill
nodded yeah so
help me-

but garry listened

get back all of you no further he snatched dores lifeless form

stop shoving or ill haul off and hit you from purtys arms disregarded the startled

 one the workers pressed back hastily

 bill took the inanimate figure away from
 his chief

 his brow clouded at the sight of swithins

  protest there was the flame of a new hope
  in his eyes his voice held an exultant ring

 quick to the ships hospital help me
 with him well save him yet

 bill was sure now his chief was crazy
exiles of the moon



but garry gave him no time to voice his
thought he slung the lifeless man over
his shoulder flying through the ship his
ungainly suit impeded him somewhat but
purty had caught up to him snatched at
dores legs and they were off in a wild
scramble against time a disordered stream
of workers behind them curious yet not
knowing quite what it was all about

  silence the color was flushing back into
the while cheeks the line of heart action
had smoothed out to a steady even pacing
then a little groan that forced its way
through blue lips dore was alive

  garry and purty quickly stopped the
machine unstrapped their comrade his
eyes had closed heas not yet conscious
but the moans came with increasing fre-
quency

  there were no doctors among the work-
ers but several of the women had been
nurses they came forward now and took
command of the situation with some of their
old imperiousness ordering everyone out
of the hospital they went deftly about their

ministratio n s
of the man re-
turned from
the dead

  the exited
crowd milled
into the main

naomi turned
to her lover
adoring yet
puzzled

 i know
youve just ac-
complished a
mirac u  o u s
thing but how

was it possi-
nathan schachner ble jt is in

concei v a b  e

that swithin could have existed in the abso-
lute zero of open space for an instant yet
he did how

  garry nodded in somewhat satisfied fash-
ion he looked around at his comrades and
the same question was written large on every
face

  speaking ostensibly to naomi he yet ad-
dressed the larger audience it was time to
explain

  you remember when i first said we
could live on the moon you were doubt-
ful and some of my friends here were
openly sceptical

  cries of thats true burst about him

well he continued poor swithin has

when they reached the hospital bay
garry dived straight for the release

cate apparatus slid out from its concealed
storage place working frantically aided

naomi darted to garrys side squeezed his
arm with a fierce pressure the hospital
bay filled with awed workers all eyes glued
to the prone figure that was being worked
on by the machine

  minutes passed and still the congested
mottled body was lifeless despair settled
slowly on the watchers but garry refused
to give up hope he kept the reviver in ac-
tion searching ceaselessly for the first
semblance of life

  at last he was rewarded a little flicker
of the pallid eyelid a faintly etched quiver
on the cardiograph chart that showed the
heart had resumed its functioning a great

proved my theories more dramatically and
more effectively in the four minutes he spent
outside than all my lecturing and figures
could have done in a year listen

  his audience crowded closer about him
eager to drink in every word

  we know that interstellar space is prac-
tically a vacuum and frigid with a temper-
ature of not more than two or three degrees
above the absolute zero we know what
would happen to a mans finger if he thrust
it into one of our tanks of liquid oxygen
which is much higher in temperature it
would freeze solid almost instantly and
become so brittle it could be broken into
little bits naturally it was assumed then
that the same thing would happen to a hu-
man being subjected to the terrific ctcl of
space

  however that is not so as we have just
seen heat may be lost by a body in three
ways by conduction by convection and by
radiation he paused for a moment to let
this sink in

  now radiation is the only method by
which a body can cool off in a vacuum such
as exists in interstellar space and loss of
heat by this method is very slow just think
of the old thermos bottles the thin shell
of vacuum enclosed by their double skins
of glass was found to be an almost perfect
non-conductor of heat liquids could be
kept warm for forty-eight hours in them
since the only way the contents could lose
heat was by radiation the amount of loss
can be readily calculated from known laws
of thermodynamics i have found it would
take over an hour for a human being ot
lose sufficient heat by radiation so that life
could not be sustained

       chapter xiii
       nearing the moon

he paused dramatically swithin was
not frozen when i brought him in he
was suffocated almost dead because for
four minutes he had no air to breathe and
the internal pressure of his body accustomed
to atmospheric pressure almost killed him
fortunately he has survived

  thats wonderful naomi breathed she
had been a rapt listener but how will
this enable us to live on the moon sup-
pose we do manage to exist for an hour or
so after we land what good will that do
us

  fearful nods from the encircling work-
ers showed their utter agreement

  simply this garry explained we
shall have to use our space suits of course
both for maintenance of needed pressure
and for oxygen to breadie well land if
we can on the dark side of the moon there
conditions approximate that of outer space
-no air and almost absolute zero temper-
ature on the bright side wed be broiled
alive by the fierce heat of the sun now
since the heat loss is so small about one de-
gree fahrenheit every ten minutes the chem-
ical heaters in our suits could very easily
offset this loss

  then all that would be necessary would
be for us to dig ourselves into underground
air sealed shelters as fast as possible and
arrange for heating and air supply

  a little murmur of dismay broke from the
assemblage not a very pleasant outlook
for us rade perrin interjected voicing
the general thought

  youre quite right garry agreed with
a shrug but its the best in sight back
on our own earth were outlaws condemned
to death

- 

in order to calculate just how long man could lire
in the absolute zero of space if he had air to breathe
parker assumed that the average human weighs 
lbs possesses a surfaoo area of  square feet and
that a drop in internal body temperature of p
would be sufficient to cause duath

   if we consider mans body to be an ideal radiator
the thermodynamic formula applying is

  btu per hour radiation per square foot is
x-j tl-t where btu are british ther-
mal units unit of heat measurement

  t is tho absolute temperature of tho human body
or f

   t is the absolute zero of space

  making the necesary substitutions we find there
would be radiated  btu per hour per squaro
foot or for  square feet of surface  btu

  since rate of radiation is an inverso function of
mass for mans weight of  pounds divide by
 then by  to obtain result expressed in min-
utes

  the result indicates a loss of p per minute
but mans body is by no means an ideal radiator
in fact it is almost three times as slow

   to apply our results to man we obtain f loss
per minute

   now a loss in body temperature of f is fatal
whereby it is readhy seen that man could exist in
the cold outer space without heating aids for 
minutes before succumbing

   we have not taken into consideration the fact that
the constant generation of heat within the human
body might not help to offset this small loss thus
extending the time limit

  jeris farr inched his way forward he
had been keeping discreetly in the back-
ground since his attempt to wreck the
flight but the manifest discontent of the
workers with the drab uninviting future
emboldened him

  you see comrades he declaimed in his
gruff pseudo-hearty manner its just what
id been telling you youre dupes thats
what you are a pretty life aiead for us
all isnt it he laughed scornfully live
under ground like moles all your lives never
a breath of fresh air nor a sight of the
heavens wed be better off dead thats what
wed be i for one am in favor of turning
back giving in to sadakuchi he promised
us mercy if we gave up those three

  he pointed at garry naomi and bill
purtell a rising murmur accompanied his
outburst it would take but little to trans-
late it into revolt

  purty saw and heard he stepped into
instant action his long hairy arm shot
out caught jeris by the scruff of the neck
he addressed his victim incisively punctu-
ating his remarks with vigorous shakes

  listen feller weve had enough from
you youre going back all right but all
alone out the air-lock for yours and
therell be no rescue act this time either
with that he started to drag the strug-
gling jeris through the astounded workers

  hold on there bill garry commanded
no rough stuff

  purty paused disgustedly jts your fun-
eral if you dont throw him out i told you
hes due to make trouble as long as hes
alive

  a few of the workers stepped forward
quietly ranged themselves alongside loyal
men all of them rade perrin brad quin-
lrn and others of their kind

  brad spoke up were with you mr
parker we know what awaits us back on
earth well go to the moon or to mars
if necessary where at least we can be free
men and alive of course it wont be a
bed of roses but well make the best of
it as for jeris farr he turned a look
of cold contempt on that individual it
would be wiser to do with him as mr pur-
tell suggests

  thanks brad garry responded grate-
fully i knew i could count on you and
the others but were not killing anyone
well leave that to the aristocrats back
home

  bill released his captive reluctantly
jeris made off as fast as possible fearful
that garry or purty would change his mind

garry dismissed the incident with a
gesture thats that now for more
important matters

  every one to his post were fast ap-
proaching the zone of the moons attraction
within a few hours well have to employ all
our skill to avoid a horrible smash-up our
plane wings will be useless remember
men if any one neglects in the slightest
the tasks assigned to him it may mean the
death of us all

  garrys grave voice shocked the mutter-
ing malcontents into silence without a
word they hastened to their posts

  i dont think well have any more trou-
ble now bill remarked youve scared
them plenty

  its the truth though garry answered
soberly any slip up and were through
i hope ill be able to manage it

  you will darling i know you will
namoi cried impulsively

  maybe garry shook his head doubt-
fully well its no use worrying about
it lets get back into the control room
and get busy

  through the periscopes the moon a vast
gleaming disk immediately below them was
visibly rushing up to meet them garry
rapped out a perfect barrage of orders for-
ward rockets were fired in searing blasts to
check their mad drop

  at three thousand miles from the surface
the starboard rockets were let loose in con-
tinuous bursts the great liner swerved in
its course slanted athwart the moons sur-
face

  cant check ourselves fast enough to
land in a perpendicular drop garry ex-
plained

 around the moon they swept in a vast
concentric spiral dropping closer and closer
on each circling the third complete cir-


wonder stories

cumnavigation brought them within five
hundred miles of the craggy volcanic crust
the forward rockets were brought into play
in tiny staccato bursts garry dared not
use full power as the ship would be instant-
ly clothed in sheets of flame anxiously he
watched the heat indicators it was getting
very warm inside but it was bearable the
outer sheathing was an excellent insulator

  at fifty miles up the speed had dropped
to five hundred miles an hour garry
changed the direction of their flight

  well land rear of the south pole he
told them

  a hasty glance at the dials everybody
into his hammock strap in he shouted
he swung himself into the oscillating net
near the instruments made sure naomi and
bill were safely ensconced heard the last
ready report shouted now and pulled
the lever that opened the forward and under
rockets full blast

  a violent concussion shook the ship
blinding flashes pierced into the chamber
through the open periscopes and the next
moment there was a terrific crash stunned
and shaken garrys first thought was for
naomi she was already unstrapping her-
self pale but smiling

  bill got up slowly and grinned rueful-
ly must have swallowed a few teeth so
weve landed on the moon eh the least
the inhabitants could have done was to
have provided a few cushions

  come on naomi cried eagerly lets
get out and explore i just cant wait to see
our new home her cheeks were flushed
her black eyes were dancing she was like
a little girl in her enthusiasm to garrys
enraptured eyes she was even more beautiful
than ever the last traces of the aristocrats
hauteur had disappeared

  hold on he laughed at her happiness
we cant just step out you know there are
preparations to be made

  hurry them up then she demanded
remember this is to be our home our
home garry her eyes were pools of ten-
derness

  garry yearned to her and you are npt
sorry remember it will be quite differ-

ent from what we all and especially you
have been accustomed to

  naomi stopped his mouth with a warm
palm i dont want to hear any more
she cried weve gone over that before

  purty was waxing impatient hey you
two love birds wake up theres work
ahead

the first exploration

ighto both were all contrition

  jlvout of the control room they ran
to be met by a wildly excited laughing cry-
ing mob gone were the animosities the
grumblings the fears that had permeated
the heterogeneous group all were eager
for the great adventure for a first glimpse
of their new home jeris farj only and two
of his cronies with dour faces held them-
selves aloof on the outer fringe

  are the space suits all in order garry
demanded of rade

  there they are numbered for each in-
dividual oxygen apparatus adjusted chem-
ical heaters set for slow combustion he
pointed to the neatly arranged tiers of the
suits

good well make up a little party of
exploration to test out the terrain pur-

	tell and you perrin garry bill and
perrin got into their space suits the last
helmet was tightened into position garry
had inserted communication disks so that
they would be able to talk to each other
the chemical combustors were adjusted for
slow heat the oxygen supply would last
for six hours heavy lead weights were
attached to their feet to counteract the les-
sened gravity pull everyone crowded about
them wishing them luck offering advice
garry looked around he did not see na-
omi

wheres naomi he asked anxiously

  here i am a merry voice answered he
whirled and found her standing directly in
back of him ungainly in a space suit

  whats this he questioned her in
amazement

  her happy laugh was triumphant just
that im going along too a fenton never
stays behind
exiles of the moon



  but- garry started to object

   s no use feller purtys gruff voice
reached him these gals are alj alike aris-
tocrats or workers once they make up
their minds you might as well save your
breath theres no argument i know the
symptoms

  thank you mr purtell for recognizing
the inevitable naomi flashed at him

  very well then garry interrupted
youre coming but please remember to
be careful he raised his voice every-
thing in order	v
right

  he stepped into the air-lock the others
trailing behind the door closed behind
a pull at the lever and the outer seal yawn-
ed

  out they stepped on the surface of the
satellite awed and a bit fearful the first
people to ever stand on that desolate orb

  a strange scene waited their amazed eyes
their weighted feet crunched into a soft
icrumbly pumice-like material all about
them was heavy palpable blackness over-
head a greater moon - the earth - rode
queenlike and myriad stars pricked the
mantle of black garry could easily pick
out his companions in the luminous earth-
shine

  but what brought an exclamation to his
lips was a glare of dazzling white immedi-
ately to the left not more than five hundred
yards away so dazzling that it blinded his
eyes beyond the light stretched intermin-
ably away little cries of astonishment
broke from the others

  for a perfectly definite line of demarca-
tion the terminator separated the bril-
liant area from the blackness a line that
stretched undeviating north and south as
far as the eye could see there was  blur
no shadow in that amazing division

  that were in luck he replied happily
we couldnt possibly have made a better
landing that glare over yonder is from

	since there is no atmosphere on the moon to hold
heat and diffuse light the demarcation between the
glaring light and boiling heat of day and the impen-
etrable dark and frigid cold of night is a distinct
and sharp line this is called the terminator  and
moves completely around the orb of the moon in a
terrestrial month in the vicinity of the pole day
and night would alternate within a range of only
a few miles

the sunlight were on the night side of the
moon for approximately fifteen days we
will be in darkness then the sun will pay us
a visit

  whatll we do then bill spoke up
stew in our own juice

  if we stay here garry agreed but
thats why i chose the suth pole for a
landing the area of day of light and heat
is comparatively narrow all well have to
do is shift over a few miles and be on the
night side again

  fine business purty retorted ironical-
ly well be-what did they call em-
bedouins of the moon-fold up our tents
regularly every fifteen days and unpack
again

      

       h the chances are well find plenty
v- of caverns around here were not
so far from tycho you know then we
can dig in and hibernate during the long
day but no use discussing that now lets
get a look around

  with ray-beams that sent a powerful
gleam over their surroundings they moved
carefully over the crumbly ground

  it was a wild weird landscape that the
flash picked out great towering crags jut-
ted unimaginably high in the pale earth-
shine huge massy rocks were tumbled in
indescribable confusion as though a race of
giants had heaved segments of forgotten
planets at each other while under foot was
the yielding pumice in which they bogged
and always beyond the terminator was a
dazzle that seared the eyes

  garry warned his companions to keep
close to him he proceeded warily toward
a beetling cliff that sprang sheer from the
disheveled plain perhaps there at the base
he would find what he was looking for

  suddenly rade perrin stumbled and al-
most fell he uttered a cry the others
came hurrying over alarmed

  look at this he said turning his ray-
beam downward

  a gleaming white marble-like surface
sprang into the illuminated area rade
swung his beam back and forth disclos-
ing the extent of the white substance to be
about fifty yards across north and south

however no matter how far he threw the
rays the gleam of white continued

  this must be one of the mysterious rays
that radiate from tycho earth scientists
have been puzzled to explain them maybe
you can tell us something purty

  maybe he grunted bending close to
the strange white material he examined it
closely playing his ray-beam over its struc-
ture

  thats queer he straightened up final-
ly ive never seen stuff like this on earth
it has the hardness and polish of marble
yet it actually is a sponge-like material hon-
eycombed with tiny cells id like to take a
sample of it back to the ship-it looks in-
teresting

  on our way back garry remarked
weve got to find some place we can dig
in if its possible

  they crossed the glimmering white path
plodded heavily through the dusty pumice
toward the high craggy overhang that was
their goal

  a great welter of rock awaited them pil-
ed high in confusion a jagged gash in the
crag showed where the tumbled boulders
had split off and crashed down the aval-
anche might have occurred unimaginable
ages ago or but yesterday-there was no tell-
irg

  hello rades flash picked out a gleam
of white in the mass of riven debric heres
some more of those tycho rays

  thats funny bill announced i
thought they went in straight lines howd
it get over here

  they do garry agreed must be an-
other one that kept on its course over the
top of the cliff and the avalanche smashed
it up dropping segments down here

  a faint shout called their attention to
naomi who had-been climbing in and out
of the giant heap with utter diseregard of
the risk of the whole delicate balance col-
lapsing

  come here quick all of you her voice
was alive with excitement

  following the reflected flare of her ray-
beam they dived through a series of inter-
stices garry racing in the lead had naomi

been caught somewhere within under a fallen
rock

  to his unutterable relief he came upon
her in a natural chamber caused by over-
arching boulders alive and unhurt she
beckoned to him impatiently pointed a wav-
ering beam at a smooth round hole in what
was evidently the side of the cliff

  garry garry that hole-its artificial
nature never smoothed anything like that

  by now bill and rade had hurried up
and they all stared the orifice was some
fifty feet across absolutely circular and
angled off abruptly into the bowels of the
cliff so that their beams could not pene-
trate very far segments of the peculiar
white material were scattered in profusion
over the base of the passageway

  garry shook his head sceptically its
impossible theres no life on the moon
its just a natural freak there are plenty
of similar examples back on the earth

  im sure it was made by intelligent be-
ings naomi insisted and im going to
find out

  without more ado she darted forward a
strange figure in her ballooning space suit
and in the instant way flying down the pas-
sageway

  come back garry shouted in alarm
but there was no answer naomi had dis-
appeared as though the moon had swallow-
ed her up

  with one accord the men raced after her
garry muttering to himself at the head-
strong wilful girl he loved

       chapter xiv
       into the depths

down the black cavity they plunged
down an ever steeper incline the
shattered white blocks littering the slope
started from underneath their feet in a lit-
tle avalanche all the more terrifying be-
cause it was soundless

  garry halted his wild plunging shouted
in his disk for the others to do the same be-
neath his helmet his face was gray with
fear

  good god well kill her if were not
exiles of the moon



careful he raised his voice and cried
again and again naomi naomi but
no answer came back to him only the
frightful silence of the airless moon in
which his labored breathing was magnified a
hundred fold

  perrins voice came to him strained and
thin im going after her mr parker i
cant stand here like this when maybe she is
suffering somewhere below trappfed god
and off he went while there flashed through
garrys agonized thoughts that boy hes
in love with naomi

  but all he said was watch those rocks
dont start them sliding again

  with infinite care they picked their way
down the descending path the ray-beams
flashed from smooth black arching walls
flecked with tiny iridescences

  say garry purtys voice resounded in
his helmet naomi was right-nature never
turned a trick like this

  but garry did not heed where was
naomi herself that was the most pressing
matter in the universe to him just now

  far ahead a gleam of light flickered ir
regularly against a black surface and was
instantly swallowed up in the blackness
garrys heart gave a great heave

  naomi he shouted again and strained
to listen was he mistaken was it merely
the echoing of his hammering pulse or was
it really naomis voice weak far-off there
it was again-help help as though it
came from a distant planet

  rade had heard too for garry could hear
his sudden exclamation as he shot reckless-
ly ahead down ever down they slid and
fell and tumbled naomis voice was still-
ed there was no further sound suddenly
the ray-beams flashed against a basalt wall
barring further progress

  garry saw the yawning irregular gap
first screamed a warning purty pulled up
in time but rade could not  stop himself
he slithered down to the edge tried to re-
cover his equilibrium could not his hands
went up and the next moment he catapulted
into the unknown

  garrys flesh crawled as he ran to the
brim flashed the ray-beam into the fear-
some depths purty was talking desperate-

ly keep a stiff upper lip old boy theyre
both all right ill bet an old hat on that
but garrys voice was strained unbeliev-
ing my god bill look

  purty leaned over and gave a great
whoop holy cats what a place their
beams flashed feverishly over the smooth
floor of a huge cavern sixty feet below
seeking yet dreading the answer

  a faint moan came up to them then an-
other 

  theyre alive garry went wild with de-
light just as the moving oval of light il-
luminated two faintly stirring bodies ly-
ing close to each other

  im going down for them bill you
wait up here for me v

  sez you bill promptly retorted you
do nothing without little purty see its
you and me both together or not at all but
how may i ask you brother are we climb-
ing down without breaking our fool necks
wed better hotfoot it back to the ship and
get a coil of rope

there seemed force to his argument
sixty feet to hard stone seemed
fraught with dire consequences there was
no way of descending safely they were
peering down through what seemed the roof
of a vast underground chamber below
scattered in profusion were jagged blocks
of the omnipresent white ray material

  garry did not bother to answer such ir-
refutable logic instead he sat himself
down and began divesting the shoes of his
space suit of the heavy lead soles that had
been placed there to weight them down

  purty goggled through his helmet in
growing amazement hey whats the big
idea gone crazy or something heres
your girl down there hurt and rade too and
you start undressing

  be a good fellow and go back to the
ship for the rope i told you pm going
down

  bill shook his helmet decisively hell
no if youve gone crazy im the red-
headed lad thats your keeper im un-
dressing too

  iwith that he proceeded clumsily to un-
screw his own shoe plates garry hesitat-


wonder stories

ed looked down again at the drop saw
naomi trying to lift her head and made up
his mind it could be chanced it would
be better if bill went back for the rope
but he knew his man too well to press the
point

  listen purty he told him well just
jump down its easy

  bill looked with an air of resignation at
the distance separating them from the bot-
tom yeah and so is dropping down the
elevator chute from level four to level
one all right he heaved himself to his
feet lets go

  a startled yell broke from him he had
soared straight up from the ground smack
ed the top of his helmet with a dangerous
crash against the roof of the tunnel and
dropped lightly back to the ground

  thats the answer garry permitted him-
self the ghost of a smile without weights
we can jump six feet to one on earth-her
goes

  without more ado he poised on the brink
and jumped purty who had been inef-
fectually trying to get at his bruised head
ran to the edge flashed his beam garry
was bfending over naomi helping her up
bill launched himself into the cavity felt
himself dropping slowly landing on his
feet with only a jar

  both naomi and rade were up now bruis-
ed and shaken but otherwise uninjured it
had been the unexpected shock of the fall
that had done most of the damage

  garry was expostulating with naomi for
her recklessness but she was not listening

   its true she cried weve fallen right
into the midst of a moon civilization look
isnt it wonderful

  and as their rays illuminated the great
underground cavern even garry forgot his
annoyance in the overwhelming awe fully
half a square mile it stretched the ground
smooth and hard as a ballroom floor a
great vaulting arch soaring dizzily overhead
intricately carved with queer intertwining
coils and strange protuberances

  i wonder what they represent rade
asked

  well soon see garry answered point-
ing to the near wall a huge implanted

circular disk gleamed redly under the im-
pact of the rays that must be a door to
some other cavern

  he strode swiftly over in long light
bounds purty soaring awkwardly behind
him unable as yet to adjust himself to his
lessened weight rade and naomi how-
ever their shoes still lead-soled walked
normally

  closely they examined the red plate
pounded on it heaved it refused to budge
purty leaned against the wall panting light-
ly in disgust suddenly the disk slid up
with a smooth silent rush that almost threw
him off balance he had touched off a hid-
den spring somewhere

  as they stepped over the threshold into
the unknown a simultaneous sigh exhaled
as one breath from the little party they
were rooted to the spot they stood on un-
able to move

  a soft green illumination emanated from
the involuted arches the curving walls the
tesselated floor of this marvelous sublunar
chamber vast and spacious it was with
fluted columns and soaring fantastic tracer-
ies that expanded into spiral whorls before
joining the lofty carven roof

  but save for a fleeting glimpse no one
heeded the strange architectural designs all
eyes were drawn irresistibly to a welter of
figures lying in distorted postures over the
green-tinged expanse of floor strange crea-
tures unimaginably different

the moon men

awed beyond speech they gathered be-
fore the nearest of the queerly sprawl-
ed moon people and stared at the dead re
presentatives of an alien race a green
giant whose head was a perfect sphere from
which stared unwinking a circling band of
a myriad violet sunken pits eyes garry
decided nothing else on the smooth sphere
except at the top a torn and shattered mem-
brane that disclosed beneath a hard green
oval

  the body was covered by a scaly sub
stance set in numerous squares while di-
rectly in the middle a funnel-shaped ori-
fice led into the interior probably a mouth
exiles of the moon



for direct inception of food into the stom-
ach he surmised there were no arms or
legs but projecting at spaced intervals all
over the round torso were sucker-like pads
doubtless the moon-man progressed by suc-
tion grips aided by a peristaltic motion an
incredible being

  and there were thousands of them piled
in great heaps scattered singly and in
groups their rotundities twisted and warp-
ed as though they had died in frightful
agony and on every one without excep-
tion the membraneous tissue was ripped and
torn with the flapped remnants turned out-
wards

  purty broke the ghastly silence his words
in strange contrasts to his usual exuber-
ance

  we have found a people on the moon
a strange inhuman people a race that pos-
sessed a civilization and we find them dead
why when were they destroyed and
what did it

  garry started out of his bemusement
the very questions i was putting to my-
self he acknowledged it is easy to re-
construct some of their history-the early
part-but after that-i dont know no
doubt they once lived on the surface in an
earlier time when the moon was young pos-
sessed of an enveloping atmosphere and per-
haps a moderate temperature

  then for some unknown reason the life-
giving blanket was dispersed used up de-
stroyed and the moon assumed its present
airless lifeless state

  the moon race must have had sufficient
warning for they prepared againstthe day
they constructed these vast underground
chambers-possibly there are thousands of
them within the bowels of the globe- and
retreated into them

  then something struck them-something
they had no knowledge of or could not
guard against-and they died in one uni-
versal cataclysm

  sounds logical purty admitted but
then that means that they had to have a
supply of oxygen for these retreats

  no question about it but that would
be easy for a race of the high civilization
evidenced here

  then there should be air in here now
naomi interjected she had been follow-
ing the discussion very closely this cham-
ber seems to have been sealed airtight
garry shook his head there is none
look he turned his ray beam straight
up you see where the circle of light im-
pacts on the green radiance of the roof but
there is no path of light through the med-
ium to it as there would be if there were
air no this place is absolutely airless
the very preservation of these bodies for
god knows how many ages indicates that
but why she insisted what hap-
pened to the atmosphere if it had been here
originally

  it might have escaped gradually through
the rocks garry submitted no stone
is absolutely impervious to infiltration
purty let out a whoop that almost jarred
the communication disks loose he had been
carefully examining one of the strange moon
race

  glory be i know the answer thats
what struck these birds down in a heap the
air gave out on them and it wasnt any slow
process either it just went out with a
rush and left them suffocating and dying
like fish in a dried-up river look here

he pointed to the torn membrane at
the top of the liead thats his breath-
ing apparatus or nose or whatever you
want to call it notice what happened the
torn edges are lying outside-just as though
an inside explosion ripped it open natur-
ally if the outside pressure of the atmos-
phere was suddenly removed this thin mem-
brane would burst from the stabilizing in-
ner pressure

   i believe youve hit it bill garry ex-
claimed

  not everything rade perrins diffident
voice intruded there is still the objec-
tion of naomi of the fentons the place
as far as we can see is airtight what caus-
ed this sudden withdrawal

  gary and purty looked at each other
stumped but garry only said thats
what well have to look around for some
break in the walls some crack due to a


wonder stories

moonquake through which it might have
escaped

  they started on a tour of exploration
carefully avoiding the strange forms frozen
here in the agony of death for uncounted
ages much they found of supreme inter-
est seemingly cultivated beds of shrivel-
led dessicated fungus-like growths ghast-
ly white in the prevailing green strange
laminated structures of polished stone that
resembled machines-one such affair that
purty inspected he swore must have been
an oxygen-generating apparatus others
that faintly resembled furnaces dynamos
and motors-yet all of the same stone mater-
ial nowhere was there evidence that metals
had been used or known

  yet the search was fruitless-there was
not the slightest sign of a break or crack
through which the air might have escaped
the whole of the vast chamber was hermet-
icallly sealed true at one point there
was a jagged outcropping from the other-
wise smooth texture of the wall a small
strata of rock had been forced through to
intrude some distance into the cavern

  what do you think of that purty quer-
ied

  garry studied it then shook his head de-
cisively no that couldnt be the reason
some minor convulsion or rock slip along
a fault might have forced that strata
through but you will note that it automati-
cally sealed itself in theres not the slight-
est sign of an open fracture around it

  isnt that rock the same stuff we found
above in the ray from tycho naomi ask-
ed

  purty peered closely youre dead
right lady he quoth disgustedly and
its you who have to tell it to me bill pur-
tell sometime chemist and assuming to
know my minerals well he sighed
guess ill return to earth and become an
aristocrat nothing else left for my ignor-
ance

  see here naomi flashed with a stamp
of her shod foot ill have you know you
cant talk that way in the presence of a
fenton i-

  garry interrupted hastily purty didnt
mean anything darling its just his way

and besides you must remember that hes
a worker-and so am i--and we are under
sentence of death imposed by the aristo-
crats

  naomi was all contrition im sorry
garry im sorry bill i forgot myself-
forgot im no longer an aristocrat either
youll forgive me wont you she plead-
ed

  surest thing forgive and forget is the
best thing i do purty responded quiz-
zically its the call of the fentons in
your blood thats what it is me im only
a classification member

  dont naomi cried in heartfelt an-
guish dont make it hard for me you
all are my very best friends i am not
superior to you in any way and i dont
want to be

  but you are rade perrin shouted
fiercely silently to himself youre a
gorgeous goddess and were all dirt be-
neath your dainty feet then he blushed
to the roots of his hair and shrank away
as though fearful the others had heard him

  garry said gravely we know it
naomi and bill does too please let us
drop it very briskly now lets get
back to the ship and get busy this place
is made to order for us heres where we
set up our own moon civilization

  purty muttered dolefully but why did
this old race pass out theres something
wrong about this picture

  nevertheless he kept his disturbing
thoughts to himself

  after several trials first throwing the
lead weights from perrins and naomis
shoes through the outer gap they all man-
aged by a series of jumps to spring up the
sixty feet and pull themselves into the
long tunnel

  as they clambered up the steep slope
purty picked up a small fragment of the
strange white ray-stone thrust it in the outer
pocket of his space suit something ham-
mered incessantly at the back of his brain
and would -not let him be some puzzle
that must he solved before he would feel
safe about their sojourn on the moon the
others did not notice the act or if they had
would have thought nothing of it
exiles of the moon



     chapter xv 
     a mysterious attack

finally when they reached the rocket
liner they found an anxious alarmed
group of workers they had been gone
almost six hours earth time

  brad quinlan was just getting ready to
go out with a search party convinced that
garry and the others had met with serious
mishap jeris farr had come to the fore
again playing very skillfully on the tensed
nerves of the workers

  the moon was uninhabitable he argued
it would be the tomb of all of them see
what had happened already to the first
party to go forth they were dead no ques-
tion about it why risk more valuable lives
in a senseless search better try to return
to earth and throw themselves on the
mercy of the aristocrats maybe theyd be
let off with transportation to an idlers
colony

  the group that naturally gravitated to
his leadership had ranged themselves along-
side for a while it seemed as though his
specious arguments would take hold even
the grea tbody of workers who were loyal
hesitated but brad had stepped boldly
into the breach in no uncertain tones he
denounced jeris and his ilk as constant
troublemakers would they desert the four
who had gone forth trusting them and
leave them to die

  that decided it the greater number
agreed that a rescue of the missing party
must first be attempted before any final
decision about remaining was reached

  but garry and the others did not know
of the dissension until much later the
workers crowded eagerly around the re-
turned explorers exultant at their safe re-
turn bursting to hear their tale

  garry sketched rapidly the complete
story of their astounding discoveries of
the great underground caverns of the
strange moon-race that had existed eons be-
fore and of whom only the pitiful bodies
and some remnants of their civilization re-
mained

  now he concluded we have been

spared the greatest difficulty of founding
our moon colony-that of excavating air-
tight quarters for our party we have them
at hand broad spacious fitted with strange
machines that we may be able to utilize af-
ter a study of their possible uses our for-
tunate discovery is a happy augury of our
future

  a loud cheer greeted his speech even the
supporters of jeris farr joined in the ac-
claim only that worthy maintained a
stony sullen silence

  they divested themselves of their space
suits bill was stacking his away when he
reminded himself of the sample of the
strange porous ray-stone he had picked up

  he wanted to analyze it find out what it
was nothing on earth resembled it and
that strange feeling persisted that some-
how their destinies on this new world were
inextricably intertwined with this innocent-
looking rock

  he took it out of its cache turned it over
thoughtfully in his hand it was light al-
most weightless and it struck him more
forcibly than ever how cellular it was it
was more spongy than a sponge

  what have you there that fascinated
you naomis clear voice startled him out
of his absorption she came closer oh
yes of course some of that mysterious stuff
from tychos rays i ought to hate it she
laughed it almost started an argument be-
tween us

  as a matter of fact it did he grinned
but whats an argument between friends
but maybe youre right for other reasons
he reverted to the stone again in all seri-
ousness its got me worried and i wont
sleep my usual twelve hours until i know
what its all about

naomis hand went suddently to her
throat garry still talking to the as-
sembled workers saw the quick gesture the
look of alarm imprinted on her features he
broke away was instantly at her side

  whats the matter dear you look
ill

  i-i dont know she gasped all of
a sudden i felt as though i were strangling
oh-oh i find it difficult to breathe some-


wonder stories

things closing my throat help me gar-

ry  

  wild with alarm at her strange predica-
ment he caught her in his arms she lay
limp breathing heavily with visible effort

  bill came up on the run the forgotten
stone still clutched tightly in his fist others
hearing the cries were crowding around

  garry turned a despairing look gt his
friend

  naomi shes ill something struck her
just like that quick help me with her to
the hospital bay

  purty opened his mouth to say something
when he gulped and inhaled violently a
slow surprise spread over his freckled fea-
ture unheeded the stone slipped out of
nerveless fingers

  ive got it too he spoke with apparent
effort good god i cant breathe air
air his face was purpling

  by now strangled cries were issuing from
tortured throats on all sides the workers
were gasping and heaving as furiously
pumping lungs were trying to obtain an ade-
quate supply of oxygen

  garry felt a slow constriction at his
throat and he too was gulping and panting
a roaring dizziness pounded in his temples
black spots danced before his eyes naomi
lay quietly limp now he laid her down
gently steadied himself to think the place
was a bedlam of staring panting men and
women laboring for breath

  no question about it-the precious air
was rapidly thinning it was taps for all of
them soon if the matter was not remedied
quickly

  garry tried to clear his head from the
pounding and hammering in his ears ei-
ther the oxygen generators had failed sud-
denly or there was a leak somewhere and
the air was rushing into the airless reaches
of the moon

  purty was swaying near him eyes bulg-
ing mouth wide open garry shouted his
voice a thin squeak in the tenuous atmos-
phere for god sakes look for a leak
im going to the generators see if we
can fix it otherwise all dead 

  he trailed off to a whisper the effort

had taken too much of the limited supply
in his luags

  purty nodded with difficulty to show that
he understood unsteadily he made his way
to the air-locks recruiting on the way sev-
eral of the stouter workers who had not
yet succumbed garry staggered to the
pumps they were working the pressure
dots on the gauge showed normal output
he placed his face close to the stream noz-
zle gulped in huge quantities of the issu-
ing oxygen

  the pounding ceased in his veins his
fuddled senses cleared it must be a leak
then

  he ran over to where naomi lay picked
her up brought her back to the pulsing oxy-
gen flow he could hardly breathe by the
time he reached it he held her still face
close to the stream but something had hap-
pened at the very tip so it seemed the
flow swirled curiously downward

  he was fighting for breath again his
whole being cried for it iron bands were
constricting about his chest crushing it in
in a haze he saw purty staggering over to
him stark horror in a mottled face weak-
ly shaking his head no leak had been
found the workers were dropping like
flies tearing at their throats as though an
obstruction was causing their suffocation

  bill stumbled a white object clattered
from under his feet there was a roaring
universe of shooting coruscating stars about
garry through the sparks he saw purty
suddenly lean forward almost lose his bal-
ance pick up the little bit of white rock
and grope drunkenly past him

  occupied as he was with the grim per-
sonal fight he was making for every spoon-
ful of near vacuum he barely heard the
thin reedy tones air-lock quick lifen
death

  like some automaton he followed the
swaying figure unknowing what he did
blood was gushing from his nose and
mouth darkness was enfolding him but
still he followed somehow they reached
the air-lock bill tried to grasp the lever
missed it and slumped to the ground he
couldnt get up again

  with the dim consciousness that was still
exiles of the moon



left him garry wondered why purty want-
ed to open the air-lock go out on the
moon die faster should have tried to
put on space suits-air there never
thought of it-too late now damn fool

  purty was gesturing weakly his blue
lips mouthed a whisper

  open

  die that way quickly bill good fellow
crazy now though oh well do as he says
cant harm any more all over anyway

  fumbling with his last ounce of strength
he found the lever thrust it home the
great round door slid open a distorted
grin showed on purty as he pushed rather
than threw the little white stone into the
air-lock

  his lips formed a desperate close it
and he collapsed into a silent heap garry
felt himself going fast his lungs were burst-
ing bill was all right now-no jmore
pain no more torture wish it were over
for him too quiet and peaceful rest
fight no more just drop down and get
it over with

  what was that purty said before he stop-
ped saying things altogether close it
what for took too much effort more
needless torture no hell no bills his
friend must obey his last words

  an arm that weighed a ton groped up-
ward with a last superhuman effort clung
with tired fingers to the lever pulled it
over

  garry had a fleeting vision of the seal
sliding back into position as he fell head-
long into an abyss of black flames then
abruptly the pounding ceased in his ears

a new home

black sparks that changed to a daz-
zle of white a chaos and heaving out of
it garry struggled upwards toward con-
sciousness dimly he felt himself gasping
great draughts of air were drawn into tor-
tured lungs then he heard a moan - it
was his own

  he sat up dizzy retching still gulping
the blessed fluid what had happened oh
yes he knew the air in the liner had

thinned out vanished but there was air
now plenty of it

  he looked around purty was up blue of
face grinning wanly but grinning close
shave eh my fault too should have
known that-

  but garry was not attending all over
the hold workers were staggering to their
feet still dazed and trembling a slender
girlish figure whose eyes were pools of fear
searching searching

  garry

naomi

  simultaneously they saw each other
garry tried to rise but his legs gave way
as he slipped back naomi darted over
caught him in her arms oh my dear
i thought you were gone this time

  his head nestled against her bosom im
just a little too tough he smiled thinly
their arms went about each other tighten-
ed purty waited patiently he was get-
ting used to these manifestations

  at length-you were saying- garry
requested politely

  yeah i was saying and thats as far as
i got purty pretended to be in a huff
but he was too full of the importance of his
news to keep it up say garry he broke
out i knew damn well that white stuff
meant something and here we are to prove
it another couple of seconds though
he grinned wryly and the proof would
have been just too perfect

  what on the moon are you talking
about

  the ray-stone of tycho of coursc bill
condescended to explain i brought along
a sample for analysis and the damn thing
almost did for us evidently it absorbs
oxygen and how can you imagine that
little lump of stone sucking up into its pores
every droy of air in the whole ship its
uncanny lucky i stumbled  it coming
back-it flashed on me that here was the
cause the rest you know

  garry nodded slowly that would ex-
plain things also the airlessness of the
moon and the sudden death of the moon-
race in their last desperate stand-remember
the protrusion of the stuff into the cavern
moon quakes must have brought underlying


wonder stories

strata of the deadly stone to the surface
to doom all life he relapsed into a brown
study

  naomi gently arose dear our people
need help there are women still uncon-
scious

  righto lets get busy

fortunately no one had suffered any ser-
ious consequences within a few hours all
were fit for duty though somewhat weak
now weve got to get to work purty

	  

  garry with purty assisting commenced
operations without delay there was no
time to waste only eleven days earth-
time remained before the lunar day would
burst upon them with its seething heat if
they were not safely ensconced below by
that time they would be compelled to re-
main locked up in the rocket liner to wait
another fifteen earth days for the lunar
night the oxygen supply was running
low-there was grave doubt whether it
would last that long

  garry explained all this with the greatest
frankness urging the necessity of whole
hearted cooperation he looked directly at
farr who avoided the glance and for con-
stant unremitting toil then  he allotted
the various tasks according to the former
training and ability of the workers and in
charge of each squad he placed a foreman
responsible personally to him

  the first and most important task was to
clean out the great underground cavern
give the thousand odd bodies of the moon
race reverent burial wall up the jutting
ray-strata clean out every little speck of
the deadly material

it took time but the men worked in re-
lays until it was done there was no sol-
diering on this job-they had had too
frightful an experience

  the next task was to set up the oxygen-
ation apparatus in the underground cham-
ber without air nothing could be done
space suits were clumsy for hard swift
work and the chemicals had to be renew-
ed every six hours accordingly every bit
of the machinery was taken carefully out
of the ships hold transported with many

groans-the sections were heavy-down the
long tunnel already a squad working fev-
erishly under brad quinlan had construct-
ed a runway down into the outer cham-
ber it was garrys idea eventually to seal
up the great break in the roof to provide
for an additional room but for the pre-
sent there was ample space for the colony
in the inner chamber

  under purtys exhortations and running
fire of good-natured bantering the work of
setting up the machines went on for thir-
ty-six hours there was unceasing hammer-
ing and tinkering the steady blows falling
and rising but making not the tiniest sound
at length the gigantic task was completed

  purty fed into the hopper of the machine
pulverized limestone of which he had
found a supply not far from the tunnel
mouth the old fashioned engines using
the treated liquid oxygen and hydrogen for
fuel started operation the limestone or
calcium carbonate was first decomposed
to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide from
which the oxygen was released by an ex-
tremely high tension arc

  with bated breath all of the workers
stopped whatever they were doing to con-
centrate their gaze on the clear quartz globe
in which the liberated oxygen should gather

  suddenly a wild cheer rang through all
the communication disks the all-pervad-
ing green glow had just disseminated
through the crystal sphere

  but purty was not content he plucked
a bit of fungus held it in the flickering elec-
tric arc till it glowed redly very cautious-
ly he opened the pet cock held the glow-
ing fungus beneath it a thin blue flame
flared up a twist of the pet cock and the
flare died out as suddenly as it had come
but bill grinned happily to himself the
stuff was oxygen all right good sound
breathable oxygen

  steadily the machine spun and whirled
steadily the engines pumped and the life-
giving gas poured into the vast chamber
faintly at first then stronger and stronger
there came to the enthralled watchers a
sound then a series of sounds the old
familiar hum and pulsing of machinery in
action there was real air in the chamber
exiles of the moon



the eerie effect of illumination on only
material objects was gone a diffused nor-
mal glow spread throughout the cavern

  a pentane thermometer adjusted for ex-
tremes of temperature was set up garry
watched it anxiously would the newly-
liberated air be warm enough to heat up this
vast space from its normal frigidity to a liv-
able temperature or would they have to
waste several more of their precious days in
installing heating equipment slowly the
pointer swung around from minus  de-
grees c it crept steadily over to minus
five degrees c-cold but bearable

  garry gave a great whoop unscrewed his
helmet with trembling fingers purty was
doing the same their bare heads emerged
simultaneously they breathed in great gulps
of the frosty air it was then somewhat sim-
ilar to that of a great mountain height but
it would do until greater volumes could be
manufactured

  the days that followed were days of
hard unremitting toil but everyone bent to
it with a will the terrible lunar day was
creeping slowly upon them the termin-
ator was only a hundred yards away now
dark glasses were necessary to gaze even
for an instant at the blazing white surface
beyond already they could feel the re-
flected waves of heat beating up at them
when they ventured out of the ship even
jeris and his cronies were chastened work-
ing with the rest

  it was a race against time all equip-
ment the food stores apparatus had to be
carried piecemeal painfully in a long end-
less trek to the caverns more than a mile
away the heat was terrific the space-suits
were baths of steaming oxygen when the
last load was safely off and the workers
trooped hastily to their new home

  garry naomi and purty were the last
to go the molten line of the terminator
was impinging on the outer shell of the
stream-lined rocket ship when the last air-
lock was securely fastened the glistening
liner was to be abandoned until the lunar
night once more made it safe to venture
abroad

  bill made a mock speech farewell oh
last tie to our earthly home-we must leave

thee but fear not little one we shall re-
turn

  garry and naomi smiled through the win-
dows of their helmets now they could see
each other without the aid of the beam-rays
the space suits were shining in the waves of
reflected light that beat upon them

  think of it dear naomi whispered
her eyes starry pools our new home-
the moon she looked overhead a thin
wisp of blue-silver in the blackness of the
sky-all that was left of her beloved earth
-her father the ordered luxuries of the
aristocrats the proud caste she had aban-
doned

  who can say there was not a little sigh
to her renunciation garry was tense for
the faintest symptom if she regretted-
but she saw the anxiety in his eyes and
smiled reassuringly

  come she said simply

chapter xvi

despair

it took time to become acclimated to their
new home at first there was a good deal
of confusion but gradually as the little
colony learned their new tasks the disor-
der lessened the strangeness of their sur-
roundings the eternal radiance of the evi-
dently radio-active rock walls the curious
lightness of their earth bodies gradually
wore off men and women were even heard
to laugh again something they had not done
since the last terrible day on the island of
death

  yet when another long lunar night had
cooled off the burning upper surface there
was eager donning of space suits as they
streamed out into the frigid blackness to
gaze longingly at the unwinking stars and
the beautifully serene earth sailing unimag-
inably high overhead

  naomi pressed as close to garry as her
ballooning space suit would permit as they
both watched the bluish tinged disk garry
sensed a certain nostalgia in her silence
he was an outlaw debarred forever from
returning the moon with its dread si-
lences its desolate wastes must forever be


wonder stories

his home but she a fenton a daughter of
the aristocrats had voluntarily forsaken all
the splendid graciousness of earth life to
be an exile-with him

  naomi he spoke softly

  what is it dear

  youre sure you do not regret what you
have done

  was that the faintest of sighs but she
answered bravely enough regret not
the tiniest bit i have you and that is all
i desire i would do it all over again if
i had the chance

  but the great love that garry bore her
was not to be deceived she meant it there
was no repining but the sacrifice to this
proudly nurtured girl had been terrific
his heart bled for her but he was helpless

	  

  dore swithin was on his feet again his
face broken out in curious mottlings as evi-
dence of his strange experience in outer
space he ran the heating plant and ran
it well the waste gases of the oxygen man-
ufacture were piped to the terminator zone
there heated by the suns tremendous radi-
ations and then forced back into the cham-
bers an inexhaustible supply of electric-
ity was assured by bill purtells happy
thought of rigging up thermocouples of
beryllium-steel and copper in closed cir-
cuit one point of junction was set on
moveable platforms in the terminator zone
to follow continuously the heat of the sun
the other junction remained always in the
shade at extremely low temperatures

  fortunately purty found mixed in with
the volcanic ash considerable quantities of
alums sulphates and carbonates in large
fractured crystals he gave vent to a
whoop of joy

  heres our water supply he cried to
garry i was worrying to death about it
oxygen we have plenty but without hydro-
gen wed be sunk after our tanks gave out
now we can use the water of crystallization
from these

  that left only one major problem for
the colonists to solve but all the others
paled into insignificance before it food
they had in their stores about a six months
supply when that was gone what

  even if all the essential elements were
found there was none of the intricate
machinery necessary to the synthesis of real
food nor was there anyone in the entire
colony who had the faintest idea of the con-
struction of the apparatus

  garry appreciated the gravity of the sit-
uation he talked it over with purty i
had some hopes of finding plant life in the
interior caverns of the moon he confessed
but thats out

  how about that fungus stuff we discov-
ered when we broke in here bill suggest-
ed

  garry shook his head decisively no
good in the first place its withered and
the most careful examination i could make
disclosed no spores or seeds besides its
not food for us even though the ancient
moon-people evidently used it

  no well have to get along with what
we have the bags of seed we brought
along therell be not much variety in our
food supply im afraid but well have to
get along

purty grimaced he liked his victuals
and a vegetarian diet did not particu-
larly appeal to him

  so well have to get started on our plant-
ing garry went on if we expect to have
a crop by the time our stores give out
hmm who knows anything about farm-
ing

  jeris farr

  bills face flamed that skunk

  cant help it hes the only one in the
colony the seeds are too precious to be
experimented with by novices if they fail
us- garrys shrug was eloquent

  purty saw his logic and subsided but
he grumbled nevertheless i hate to put
that bird in charge i dont trust him fur-
ther than i can throw a fit

  jeris took the news of his appointment as
agriculturist with outward apathy but
there was a gleam in his little pigs eyes
and the black bristles of his beard quivered
slightly garry ignored the mans sullen-
ness and explained to him very carefully
the importance of his task how the very
exiles of the moon



life of the colony depended on his success
in growing the precious seeds

  farr sneered openly now so the high
and mighty so-called leader has to depend
on me eh finds he dont know so muchs
he thought hey

  garry controlled himself with an effort
none of us know everything nor do we
pretend to he answered evenly you are
qualified for that particular job and its
up to you to make good on it

  well dont try to teach me my business
jeris growled in his beard and turned
abruptly away garry stared after him
thoughtfully

  a month later the whole colony spent
a goodly part of their leisure hours in
eager inspection of the carefully raked soil
beds where the seeds had been planted un-
der farrs supervision under the forcing
influences employed the first tender green
shoots should be pushing their way through
the  brown earth a fever of expectancy
was in the air would the seedlings take
root in this strange environment would
the grain grow

  even the poorest witted of the workers
knew that their very lives hung in the bal-
ance sharp eyes scanned the level earth
continually for the first sign of a crack
but there was none not the tiniest

  a week passed two still nothing the
great patch of ground was bare lifeless
despair crept upon them the slow despair
of people who still hoped but were begin-
ning to fear 

  garry questioned farr but the man was
sullen

  im doing my best cant help it if the
damn stuff doesnt grow seeds might have
been sterile ground may be no good how
should i know parker thought he sensed
an undercurrent of mockery of hidden ex-
ultation in the mans attitude but he had
nothing definite to go on

  two months and still not a sign by
now surely allowing all leeway the grain
should have sprouted the workers were
frightened the men becoming bitter and
ably naomi went about trying to comfort
reckless while the women cried intermin-
to cheer them up but they refused her min-

istrations angrily somehow they connect-
ed her an aristocrat with their misfortunes
work slackened the men hung around the
fateful area for hoursscanning the ground
with hard bitter eyes

  despair grew into muttered imprecations
little knots muttered together and drew
apart as garry or purty approached the
atmosphere was electric a spark might set
them off into wild senseless mob violence
in a few months they would all be dead any-
way so why work

  and jeris farr his black face a per-
petual taunt circulated industriously among
the disaffected whispering whispering

  garry was frankly puzzled i dont un-
derstand it purty he confided that soil
looks to me just as good as any ive seen
on earth and the fact remains that the
moon-race actually did grew things in it-
remember we found the planted fungi
purty considered theres something
smelly about the whole affair that ape
farr is in charge and nothing is growing
seems to me theres a connection there
nonsense objected garry the man
wouldnt be so crazy that to spite us hed
kill off the whole colony including him-
self

treachery

cittes got something up his sleeve
jl purty said slowly and it doesnt
mean losing his precious skin either tell
you what im curious im going to dig
up the edge of the bed and see why the
blasted stuff isnt taking hold

  theres nothing else to do garry
agreed

  in short order purty was wielding a
vigorous spade jeris farr saw him came
running over black rage flaming through
his distorted countenance

  here you cant do that

  purty paused to look him over contemp-
tuously who says i cant he challeng-
ed

  i do fairly shouted the other a crowd
of workers attracted by the commotion
surrounded them jeris turned to them
see what hes doing this fellow that


wonder stories

brought us all out here to rot hes destroy-
ing any chance there might be of the grain
coming up

  purty disregarded the growls that went
up from the workers notably from those
who were farrs cronies he spat on his
hands contemplatively took a firmer grip
on the spade while little lights danced in
his bright blue eyes

  and whos going to stop me

  there was a little edging toward him but
garry swithin perrin and quinlan burst
through the encircling crew garry raised
his voice commandingly back everyone
of you purtell knows whats hes doing
and its for your own good i tell you
the threatening adherents of farr shrank
back from the little body of determined
men they had had samples enough of
their prowess purty turned regretfully
here youve got to come butting in and
kill a nice little war i was just aching
to spoil that bozos face for him well
have to be some other time now

  his spade bit deep he turned over the
soil carefully a few blackened shrivelled
seeds fell loose

  see that just as i thought all dead as
a door knob s funny must be a reason
he bent down to examine the scattered
soil suddenly his freckled face went grim
his jaw hardened he scooped up some of
the dirt in the palm of his hand held it up
for garry to see

  the dirty double crossing nameless
rat there was a deadly slowness to his
speech that was not usual with him

  why whats the matter exclaimed
garry

  look here see that scattering of white
thats alum powder the residue from our
water generator after the removal of the
water of crystallization no wonder noth-
ing could grow here its burnt the seeds
to a crisp

  garry stared fascinated at the noxious
mineral so this was the end of the great
scheme of colonizing the moon as a haven
of refuge to the oppressed workers of the
earth

  purty and he looked blankly at each

other all their precious seeds had been
sown and all were destroyed a bare two
months their proesent food supply would
last and then- death by slow starva-
tion

  garry felt a surge of cold reasoned an-
ger at the despicable wretch who had
brought them to this pass but purty was
the first to act with a wild wlfoop he
dived through the scattering workers
straight for jeris farr the man saw him
coming set himself to meet the attack but
he never had a chance a long ape-like
arm shot out from nowhere caught him
fairly on the point of the chin the power
of the blow lifted him off his feet and he
came crashing down into a twitching mass
bill stood over him a devastating fury
get up you yellow bellied thieving son
of a cross-eyed sea cook he roared get
up and take whats coming to you but
the fallen figure did not stir

  a few of farrs cronies came forward
protesting here here that isnt fair
why do you attack jeris farr like that

  because it was garry who spoke up
this time he lias surpassed all his former
villainies look he cried holding up a
spadeful of earth for all to see for some
unknown reason jeris farr has sentenced us
all to death he deliberately mixed alum
in with the soil to kill off the seeds he
has succeeded we have no more when
our food runs out we are through there
will be ione to take its place do you
know what that means

a murmur ran through the men and
women as the purport of garrys im-
passioned speech penetrated their dazed
minds the murmur grew to a growl the
growl tc a roar a roar of mingled terror
and execration for the man who had sealed
their death-warrant

  then someone shouted kill the rat
the cry took hold in the twinkling of an
eye the colonists were transformed into a
raging shrieking mob clamoring lusting
for the blood of the prone man they surg-
ed forward tumultuously to tear him limb
from limb his former intimates were in
exiles of the moon



the forefront eager to be the first to stamp
on him to seek vengeance for the betrayal of
their own lives

  garry threw himself forward straddled
the limp figure like a clarion his voice
burst above the tumult

 stop well have no blood on our
hands not even the blood of jeris farr we
are civilized beings not animals i have a
better plan if youll listen

  such was the force of his cool command-
ing presence that the rush halted dead in
its tracks with blood-shot eyes-and snarl-
ing lips they paused and waited

  garry seized the opportunity to speak
rapidly he has been a traitor to us all
along i blame my own forbearance in the
face of much provocation for this last
dastardly deed it was his idea to force us
to return to earth where he could make his
peace with the aristocrats by betraying us
to their tender mercies you know as well
as i what we could expect death well
were facing it here but at least we can
face it as free men and women not as cow-
ards and slinking slaves

  but jeris farr shall not avail himself
of his treachery he shall not even be per-
mitted to have the comfort of the compan-
ionship of strong comrades when the in-
evitable end comes let us give him a
space suit and thrust him out of our society
onto the surface of the moon there to shift
for himself he has destroyed our food
our hopes-let him go out alone without
food with only the air in his oxygen hel-
met what do you say

  a babel of voices rose high no no
someone yelled throw him out without
a space suit dont give him a chance
absolutely not garry retorted vigor-
ously that is murder his chances of
survival will be slim enough

  and so after hot futile arguments it was
decided

  farr was dragged roughly to his feet-
he had come to by now-and told of the
decision he took it in sullen defiance his
black face glowering he was thrust none
too gently in his suit and personally con-

ducted by purty to the mouth of the outer
shaft it was night again and the black-
ness was impenetrable there was no earth
shining in the sky

  get out you louse and stay out i hope
it takes you a good long time to croak
bill gave hinj a parting kick that relieved
his savage feelings considerably and return-
ed in better humor

  a consultation was in progress garry
greeted him weve been waiting for you
there were swithin and perrin quinlan and
naomi their faces were pale and set
there was no underestimating the desper-
ateness of their condition outside their
little walled-off room the workers were
giving way to utter despair an apathy
stole over them broken only by the low
moaning of some women grim lingering
death stared them all in the face

  garry addressed the little group frank-
ly were up against it yet we must some-
how find a way out there is no possibil-
ity of any animal or vegetable life on the
moon no use discussing it even returning
to earth is out of the question death waits
us there also we cannot hide from the
aristocrats the earth is too well policed
fight them is just another form of suicide
what could our few hundred unarmed do
against a whole world

  i say fight purty broke in heatedly
i vote for taking the old ship shoving off
and head for new york kill as many of
the damned aristos as we can before we get
bumped off at least well die like men
not like rats in a trap

  there were murmurs of approval from
the other men they were fighters all of
them

  garry shook his head doubtfully as a
last resort yes he agreed but thats
not a solution thats just choosing our
death isnt there anyone who has a plan
to get our people out of this predicament
whole

  his questing eyes moved over the set
grave faces silence his gaze rested on
naomi and softened poor naomi she
was going out with the rest

a solution

but naomis eyes were not on her lover
she was staring thoughtfully at the
place where a cemented patch protruded
from the smooth surface of the wall her
forehead puckered into a tiny frown then
like the sun bursting from behind a glow-
ering cloud an excited smile swept over the
perfect oval of her face

   oh how stupid of me how stupid of all
 of us here we stand condemned to death
 and salvation is staring straight at us

 the four men turned to her at once
what do you mean naomi garry cried

   bill put the idea into my head with his
 eternal cry of fight her dark eyes
 danced as the words came tumbling out in
 a little rush of course well fight and
 well win too you said garry that we
 have no weapons i say that we have potent
 ones too so potent that the earth and all
 my caste will bow down at your feet

   purty had bowed ironically at her refer-
 ences to him but now his honest freckled
 face lit up as he sniffed the taint of ap-
 proaching battle

   say lady he clamored the weapons
the weapons show me the weapons
naomi lifted her arm dramatically
there she pointed to the recently ce-
mented patch the men looked blank

  oh you fools she stormed and i
thought you all had brains dont you see
dont you know what is behind that patch
the ray-stone of tycho

   a moment of puzzled non-understanding
then garry and bill let out a simultaneous
whoop

  naomi darling you have saved us
again garrys eyes were adoring

   purty was wringing her hand frantical-
ly the little white hand totally submerged
in the great hairy paw lady youre a
wiz i hereby humbly and solemnly apol-
ogize if that bozo garry ever gives you
the air you just comedo little purty and
hell take you in

   when he  give me up ill consider your
 generous offer in the meantime my hand

cant stand the strain purty dropped it
hastily

  garry had her in his arms youre just
wonderful it took your quick wit to set
us right

  the others stared at the trio blankly
they still hadnt grasped the idea garry
saw their bewildered looks and laughed
jiappily

  you boys dont get it yet

  they shook their heads

  you remember what happened on the
flier when purty brought in a tiny piece of
the ray-stone

  rade spoke up can we ever forget
exactly that little bit of stone sucked
in the entire atmosphere of the great ship
now suppose we load up the old boat with
the stuff carefully sealed of course and
take it back with us to the earth well
plant it all around new york use your
imaginations for the rest how long would
the city last or any other great metro-
polis where we choose to drop it

  there was instant comprehension rade
and brad burst into wild cheers dore
swithin was as impassive as ever noth-
ing had ever been known to change his
quiet sardonic air

	  

  all was bustle and confusion the men
worked as they had never worked before
the prospect of deliverance from the fate
that awaited them the possibility of com-
pelling the masters of the earth to bow
before them infused new life into their
veins as usual though there were some
who could not grasp the significance of
naomis proposal who were lapsing into
the fatalistic apathy of those of their kind
who had been destroyed on the island of
death but the anger of the majority forc-
ed them to work albeit unwillingly

  as garry explained it was impossible to
take the entire colony back to earth every
inch of available space was needed for the
precious cargo of ray-stones the more
that could be planted in strategic centers
the more chance of bringing the proud
aristocrats to their knees it was not to be
a matter of brute strength but of subtlety
utter secrecy and infinite daring
exiles of the moon



  three were to go-no more garry as
leader naomi because of her knowledge of
aristocrat ways and ability to move among
them unobserved and rade perrin to as-
sist in the operation of the rocket-ship and
to carry on if garry was caught rade
blushed like a girl at the designation and
the furtive sidelong glance he cast at naomi
told even more

but bill raised a howl of disappoint-
ment wha-a-at he yelled leave
little purty behind when theres a fight to
be had no siree i go too

  no you dont bill garry told him
flatly you swithin and quinlan are
necessary here itll be a big enough job
for au of you to keep things going and the
workers contented until we return if we
dont youll know its because all of us
are dead and then itll be up to you to find
another way out

  it took purty long enough to see the logic
of the situation and even then he grumbled
and growled a fight and me not in it
purty old boy youre just a doddering old
executive thats what

  tons of ray-stone of tycho were chopped
out and broken into little pieces to provide
the greatest possible area of surface it
was carefully packed in drums in canisters
in tanks in every container that was on
hand by the end of a week of earth days
the hold of the liner was brimming over
with the strange crushed rock

  a small store of food was placed on board
-the crew of three would not need much
all other equipment was set in order the
last repairs made to the delicate apparatus
they were ready to start

  nothing had been seen of jeris farr since
his expulsion from the colony he had
wandered off -in the blackness of the night
and disappeared as though the ground had
opened and swallowed him up the deso-
late moon was guarding her secrets well
no one thought he was alive-it was believ-
ed he had crept into some hole to die

  none that is but bill purtell he shook
his head and growled

  you cant scotch a snake like him so

easily mark my words well hear from
him yet and plenty

  but garry only laughed

  the entire colony was congregated before
the air-lock of the rocket liner awkward
ungainly in their ballooning space suits
the dazzling day was but a few yards away
from the hull within an earth hour the
ship would be bathed in the fiery glow the
loading had been completed just in time

  the adventurous trio garry naomi and
rade were standing at the entrance the
colonists whose lives depended on the suc-
cess of their mission were startlingly il-
luminated against the black curtain of
night by the reflected glare of the approach-
ing lunar day no one spoke but sobs came
here and there through the communication
disks would they ever see each other
again the three pressed close to each
other for comfort

  a hoarse grulff voice fighting to over-
come unaccustomed emotion sounded in
their ears it was purtys times up go
garry naomi and rade and-and-damn
it all-you know what i mean a chok-
ing sound came to them as a figure turned
and ran to the rear their own eyes were
bright with unshed tears

  garry waved his hand-that was all he
could trust himself to do good old purty
good old everybody a roar of sound calm-
ored in their helmets the workers were
shouting crying farewell the last they
saw as the great outer seal silently slid
into position was frantic waving arms and
a weird sea of bobbing helmets

  they were in the control room fastened
in the swinging hammocks garry was si-
lently watching the chronometer the affair
had been timed perfectly in thirty seconds
they were to take off time enough for the
colonists to retreat out of range of the sear-
ing blasts of the rocket tubes just on the
dot for the calculated course back to earth

  the light dot was bisected by the hair-
line gafry pressed the button thre was
a roar a blinding flash through the peri-
scope an awful sense of compression and
garry passed out but only momentarily
he struggled out of the hammock released
the others no one was hurt the second

experience was not nearly as bad as the
first the moon was rushing from beneath
them a great craggy pitted landscape the
start had been successful would their mis-
sion be equally successful each tried to
find the answer in the others eyes

return of the exiles

the long rush through space was un-
eventful garry was no longer a
novice at interplanetary flying he plotted
the course touched off corrective rocket
bursts avoided huge meteorites with as-
sured ease and facility to naomi and
rade he explained his plans

  ill try to land on the island of levis
were running rather short of fuel there
ought to be tanks of it down there remem-
ber we left a lot behind

  on schedule time the liner reached with-
in striking distance of the earth parry
swerved the ship sharply repeating the
initial landing maneuver that had brought
them safely to the surface of the moon
the great craft zoomed through the unre-
sistant ether like a new satellite around the
earth three times it flashed over the
round face of the world on a long spiral
slant the third time at a height of one
hundred and fifty miles the streamlines bit
into the resistant atmosphere

  half way around on the fourth circling
garry changed over the huge airfoils
caught hold with the scream of a thousand
devils the gyrocopter vanes whirled aloft
the turbines screamed and settled into
steady vibration they were home again-
if this earth on which their lives were for-
feit could be called their home

  nevertheless the exiles stared down at
the fleeting familiar landscape with the
yearning of returned prodigals they were
skimming over asia now the broad siber-
ian steppes turned beneath in a shining
blue of green it was spring now how
different from the alien inimical desolate
moon this lovely earth was theirs there
was no other like it in the universe simul-
taneously they turned to each other each
read aright the shining resolve in the others
eyes they would conquer for themselves

and for those poor people left on the moon
a place in their fair world or die in the at-
tempt there must be no turning back

  soon the pacific rolled blue beneath
garry plotted his course by the intermittent
signals that came through from greenwich

it gave him an odd thrill to see once more
the old familiar dots coursing over the 
charts the televisor was scanned eagerly
but only the interminable wastes of water
flashes at them

  then its over there see rose rades
joyous shout almost in the center of the
visor the white of the screen showed a
blank circle against the tossing heaving
pacific

  garry smiled his satisfaction well
drp to the three mile level and have a look
-see before we land mustnt take any
chances you know

  think there are police still on the is-
land naomi queried anxiously

  garry shrugged cant tell there
shouldnt be any of course now that vedor
island has lost its usefulness but sada-
kuchi may have anticipated the possibility
of our return

  naomi shuddered at the mention of the
hated name a sickening wave of repul-
sion swept over her as she thought how
near she had been to marriage with that
suave cruel asiatic garry saw it and
folded her in his arms protectingly

  whatever happens she whispered
dont let me fall into his hands her
lover nodded fiercely as he pressed her
closer

  rade averted his eyes his devotion was
log-like hopeless yet something hurt inside
at the sight of their complete absorption in
each other

  three mile level reached sir he re-
ported coldly efficiently

  garry released the girl sprang to the
periscopes the televisor was useless in
this area as he peered into the lens the
others saw his body stiffen suddenly and
heard the involuntary groan that escaped
him

  what is it naomis voice sounded in
his ear

  he turned to her a face from which all
exiles of the moon



the blood bad drained look for your-
self the words issued slowly

  with a beating heart she took his place
at the lens below the two islands were
within the range of vision vedor the is-
land of death drew her eyes as though it
were a magnet she stared with a slow-
ly dawning horror

  there sure enough was the familiar out-
lines of the terrible black mountain but
the truncated top the vast shimmering bowl
of the green luminescent gas where were
they

  in its place she saw a great metal dome
from which a huge pipe line dropped down
the steep slope of the mountain writhed
across the beach and plunged into the sea

  her fascinated eyes followed its dim out-
line through the translucent waters to its
emergence on the island of levis her
heart almost stopped beating for levis
was swarming with tiny moving dots and
though they could not distinguish at this
height they fancied they made out the yel-
low of the chemical workers and the flam-
ing scarlet of sadakuchis police

as she turned away garry met her with
level gaze he was himself once more
contained resourceful

  yes dear he said gently i know
what youre about to say

  somehow the aristocrats have discov-
ered the effect of the gas on the explosion
rate of the fuel mixture and they have al-
ready set up a plant to utilize the phenom-
enon and the worst of it is that it was
probably one of the old crew of this ship
who reported the secret

  he smiled bitterly down trodden
slaves ready to curry favor by squealing
 their own kind no wonder the masters
have lorded it so securely and so long

  but what are we going to do now
rade burst out we cant hide any place
else on the face of the earth their damned
televisors will pick out the ship and reveal
us

  that is a problem garry agreed of
course he continued musingly we could
sink the ship offshore somewhere and trust
to our wits ot carry us through

  perrin objected then we cant carry
more than a handful of the ray-stone and
even if we do damage somehow how are we
going to get back to the moon for our wait-
ing comrades

thats true garry nodded well
simply have to find some spot where the
visors cant get at us to park the old boat 
a memory struggled dimly in naomis
consciousness her maid emma

  i have it she cried delightedly the
very place

  where

  in the great mid-continent park re-
member i told you emma went there to hide
herself from my fathers wrath its the
only wild territory left in the americas the
rockies cut right through it you know full
of ravines and gorges and shaded glens
very few people there at this time of the
year-theres snow on the mountains yet
and only a handful of rangers

  emma knows the chief-hell be loyal
we can easily hide the ship in an inaccessi-
ble cleft and use that as a base for oper-
ations besides she ended with a little
wistful smile ill be very glad to see
emma again she was like a mother to
me even though she was only a worker
the very place garry wasted no fur-
ther comment he made his decisions
swiftly

  a lever closed the gyrocopter vanes and
the expanse of wings another shut off the
turbines from their roaring action a but-
ton and the rockets spurted in continuous
sheets of flame once more they were a
rocket flier hurtling through the strato-
sphere at half a mile a second to their new
destination

  in two hours its change-over was made
the gyrocopters held them motionless over
a vast wilderness of serrated peaks that
thrust their hoary heads boldly into the air
halfway up their slopes and as far around
as the visors showed was a tangle of dense
forests and rushing tumbling silver streams
not a sign of life in thousands of square
miles not a curling smoke drift not a habi-
tation to show that man or his works had
over defaced the primitive wilderness

  a hundred years before the world coun-

cil had ruthlessly evacuated and turn down
town after town within this area replanted
it with stately pines and cedars and de-
creed that forever this was to be natural
parkland inviolate only the aristocrats
were permitted to enjoy its marvelous pos-
sibilities as a playground the workers were
rigorously excluded except for the neces-
sary rangers and foresters

chapter xviii
a sudden onslaught

garry and rade perrin hung entranced
over the glamorous view rade had
never been out of new york while on earth
and garry had zipped over it countless
times but fifty miles up where the land-
scape was only a blur naomi had been
there several times but even to her the
tumbled mountains and stately forests were
an ever-present delight

  the problem is where to land garry
broke the silence some place where well
not be seen do you know of any naomi
she shook her head i cant seem to
place our position she confessed it
looks quite different from the air than when
youre on the ground

  garry cruised slowly along just clearing
several jagged peaks his keen eyes search-
ing the terrain

  i hope the visors dont catch our im-
age perrin sounded worried

  thats a chance well have to take was
garrys grim response then he leaned for-
ward over the scope holding the ship mo-
tionless when he straightened his face
showed his relief

  just the spot for us made to order
a canyon just broad enough to let us
through the bottom seems to widen out a
bit theres a stream running through it
very gently he set the great liner down
a precipitous mountain loomed to one side
as they dropped cutting off their sight with
a vast wall of rock down down they
went the canyon swam into view a curv-
ing gash in the wooded slope garry jock-
eyed into position and eased the boat very
carefully into the yawning gap a tense

moment as she settled was there sufficient
clearance a shuddering scrape on one
side a bump on the other and the tired old
freighter drifted by imperceptible stages to
the grassy floor of the chasm came to rest
with hardly a tremor

  it was a perfect landing garry was se-
cretly proud for he was a rocket flier not
a plane pilot but his face was as calm as
ever as he opened the wide exit door

  now for a breath of real air that smells
of trees and pastures not of filthy chem-
icals

  with one accord they moved to the door
sniffing eagerly the odorous wind that la-
ready had glided into the stuffy interior
the way lay past the cargo checkers cage
where the supercargo hand-checked each bale
as it was brought into the hold in the days
when the old craft had been a freighter
now the cubby hole was dark useless un-
tenanted

  naomi was the first to hear the rustling
sound the stealthy tread she turned
swiftly a startled scream rang out a
scream of warning it was too late garry
went down in a bloody heap under the
smashing impact of the uplifted bludgeon
rade perrin whirled just in time to catch a
glimpse of the bearded hate-filled face the
heavy cudgel raised high to strike he
threw up his hand toward the threatened
blow and tried to dodge the descending
weapon broke down his guard caught him
glancing on the forehead ho too dropped
with a little moan and lay still

  naomi darted in a fury of beating fists
you-you she choked with the intensity
of hei wrath but she was no match for the
assailant a powerful arm shot out caught
her in a grip of steel in spite of her fur-
ious strugglings the man bound her swiftly
and expertly with a length of rope he drag-
ged out of the cage she lay helpless watch-
ing him proceed coolly to truss up the two
unconscious men

  thought i was lying dead and frozen
up there on the moon didnt you growl-
ed farr as he finished his task a vicious
kick drove into the ribs of the unconscious
parker see how you like that mr
leader
exiles of the moon



  stop that you brute coward kicking
an unconscious man you wouldnt dare
if he was able to fight back jeris whirled
to her a vicious snarl twisting his mouth

  whore you calling a coward me
think again lady id like to know who
else could have gotten out of the mess i
was in its taken guts i tell you

  sneak traitor the girl was finding
an unholy satisfaction in thus baiting the
man who had finally ruined all garrys
plans and hopes satisfaction and refuge
from hysteric weeping shed never break
down in front of farr-never her little
fists clenched and she spat another epithet
at him fool

a roaring laugh came from jeris
fool am i thats the best joke yet
its parker whos the fool and that ape pur-
tell they thought theyd gotten rid of me
huh kickin me out to die

  hell i near split my sides laughin just
as soon as i got out o sight there was the
ship restin nice and pretty without a single
guard on board there was plenty o food
on her for one man and plenty o hiding
places so i just opened the door an walk-
ed in snug as a bug in a rug i waited for
what i knew had to happen

  you guys had only enough grub left for
a month or so an you couldnt get any
more id damn well taken care o that
somebody would have to sail the ship back
to earth mebbe the whole colony mebbe
only a delegation but sooner or later
back to earth shed have to go so all i
had to do was to wait

  he paused and chuckled too bad i
didnt know how to run the ship myself
that would have been the best joke of all
to leave you stranded on the moon while
i piked off on my lone id like to have
done it

  what do you think youre going to do
now

  the little pig eyes wandered slowly over
naomis prostrate figure i know what id
like to do he muttered to himself aloud
however he said thats easy im going
back there in the cubby-hole to get my com-
munication disk ami im goin to let henry

 of the fentons know that ive got his daugh-
 ter here for him and also the guy that
 swiped her guess there wont be a nice
 little reward fer jeris farr when that news
 gets to new york and wont i laugh
 when i see parker gettin whats cornin to
 him

   oh you couldnt wouldnt dare

   i wouldnt huh watch and the rene-
 gade started off to carry out his threat

   hey there whats all this a gruff
 voice started farr into whirling again in
 the entrance stood a burly figure clad in
 the forest-green of the park rangers hisj
 gnarled hands held a paralyzing projector
 no worker was permitted under any circum-
 stances to handle more lethal weapons
 stick up your hands

   farrs hairy arms went slowly over his
 head

   now suppose you do some explaining
 youve got plenty of it to do too-youve
 broken about every park regulation there
 is the ranger mouthed the list lovingly
 unauthorized workers present in park
 landin rocket-ship in park disorderly con-
 duct in park enterin the park by other
 than the designated air-ways not reportin
 presence in park at entrance air-ways and
 a skintillion others its goin to take me
 a half a day to telewrite my report on this

 where the devil did you come from that
 you dont know the rules

   we just came from the moon officer
 and- farr began to be interrupted by a
 raucous laugh

   from the moon is it so yere trying
 to kid me are yeh well no prisoner has
 kidded john matson yet

   what did you say your name was john
 matson naomis eyes had opened wide
 she was writhing herself to a sitting position

   thats right john matson instinctive-
 ly a note of respect crept into the mans
 voice as he replied though there was noth-
 ing to indicate that the girl was other than
 a worker

   then you know emma white

 the man started a veil dropped over his
 eyes emma white hs repeated slowly
 you do i know you do many a time


wonder stories

has she spoken your name your wife was
her sister julia white

  whore you the astounded matson de-
manded

   naomi of the fentons emmas mistress
what in them clothes the ranger
stepped forward then paused i dont
know what youre talking about i dont
know no emma white and what would a
worker like me have to do with naomi of
the fentons

  oh exasperatedly dont be stupid
im not a spy looking for emma if shes
here call her shell soon tell you who
i am

into the forest

the big forest-keeper looked from na-
omi to farr his eyes shifted to the
recumbent forms of garry and perrin then
back again to naomi at last he said well
i dunno mebbe youre tellin the truth
mebbe even this guy what says you come
from the moon aint lyin but it looks
mighty queer to me all o this looks
queer with the three o you tied up

   this gave jeris farr the cue he was wait-
ing for listen he broke in eagerly its
all true she is naomi of the fentons and
thats the man she ran away with do you
know what that means to you youre a
made man just play along with me help me
get word to henry of the fentons and youll
be able to ask for whatever you want
oh so thats the way the land lies is
it here get them hands up an keep em
up thstw was no friendship in matsons
grim voice say miss im beginning to
dislike this guy i tell you what ill do
im goin to tie him up like the others an
then you an i are goin to take a-little
walk

  you damn fool youre throwing away
the opportunity of a lifetime

  oh yeah now heres some nice rope
thatll fix you up pretty s-o-o-o now
you kin put them hands down so-o-o-o and
so-o-o there thats a pretty good job
now lay down like a nice leetle boy-oh
you wont huh you may be a big guy on
the moon but youre just -a blowhard in

mid-continent park now i dont think
youll wander very far till john matson
sez that you kin

  farr lay neatly trussed up the end of
the rope that bound him fastened to a steel
stanchion a not-too-clean wad of waste had
been shoved into his mouthy to quell the
stream of profanity that had accompanied
matsons operation

  all right missy now well cut your
ropes and well take that little walk i
spoke of before

  and the boys too naomi begged eager-
ly as the rangers keen knife sliced through
her lashings

  nosser not them flatly refused mat-
son again that queer gleam peeped from
his eyes they lay here till we take that
walk

  then let me take care of them the
girl freed sprang to her feet ran to the
prone garry she kneeled garry dear
are you badly hurt his head was in her
arms white fingers searched gently through
the thick blond hair

   garry stirred groaned his eyes opened
stared dazedly wha-what happened
farr ambushed you hit you on the head
farr why hes dead

   no hes alive too much alive but just
a minute while i take care of rade

  the boy had also come to his face lit
as the girl knelt at his side im quite all
right naomi of the fentons dont trouble
yourself about me his eyes were big with
admiration hows the chief

   oh im so glad neither of you are hurt
badly naomis eyes danced listen
boys i think our troubles are pretty well
over she told rapidly the events of the
past fifteen minutes john maston she
wound up is the person to whom i sent
emma from the zz special embarkation
field in new york and she must still be
here even though her brother-in-law is so
reluctant to admit it im going with him
and you boys just rest here quietly im
sure everything will be all right naomi
was expressing a confidence she did not feel
for matson was acting in a troublingly
queer manner
exiles of the moon



  all right mr matson im ready to go
with you

  the man in forest green bent over the
recumbent forms of garry and perrin his
brawny hand tugged and tested their bonds
he was evidently taking no chances of
naomis having covertly freed her friends

  okay come on you go ahead of me
sos i can keep an eye on you

  a zigzag narrow path led up the preci-
pitous side of the ravine into which the
rocket-ship had descended

  as the path came over the lip of the cliff
it plunged at once into the depths of a for-
est giant pines soared two hundred feet
from the very brink of the precipice their
far spreading boughs meeting and interlac-
ing to form an almost continuous green
roof

  naomi breathed deep of the fragrance and
new life flowed into her even the watchful
eyes of her escort the projector held ready
for action could not disturb the feeling of
well-being that pervaded her it was good
to be back on earth again good to feel the
soft slither of the humus beneath the cool
touch of the breeze on her cheek

	 o top here her armed escort snap-

  o	ped suddenly the curt command
formed the first sounds to come from his lips
since they had left the ship there was a
little clearing where the tail-springing trees
opened a space and a thicket of man-high
bushes had taken their place the dim trail
dived into the thicket followed a tortuous
course where one could scarce see a hands-
breath in front

  the girl halted matson stood listening
a moment then whistled three notes as-
cending a pause a trill from somewhere
ahead startlingly close the call was repeat-
ed a gangling youngster appeared gog-
glin-g at the girl he too was in forest
green carrying a paralyzer

  here jim i want you to do something
matson put an arm around the youths
shoulder whispered in his ear you un-
derstand the older man finished aloud
now snap into it

  jim bobbed his head turned and was
gone naomi rubbed her eyes he had dis-

appeared into the green so quickly so noise-
less was his passage through the thickly in-
terlaced bushes that she thought she had
imagined his presence

  go on about ten yards well wait there
the girl walked forward an opening
had been hacked into the greenery a boul-
der invited her she sat down her guide
stood silently she noted that his vigilance
had not relaxed the projector was tensed
for quick action

  a soft rustling sounded in the bushes be-
yond naomi turned to its source but tfte
foliage was too thick the noise came nearer
then stopped only for a moment though
hien there erupted into the clearing a bux-
om gray haired woman the pastel orchid
of her silken domestic workers dress flut-
tering with the speed of her coming her
arms were outstretched

  miss naomi miss naomi is it really
you oh how ive cried and cried won-
dering what had become of you the ex-
cited hands fluttered over the girl as if to
assure themselves that she was no phantom

  naomi was standing her face glowing
for a moment she struggled with the old
hauteur of the class she had forsworn then
her arms went out around the form of her
old nurse her head was pillowed on the
ample bosom sobs choked her

  oh emma its so good to see you
again

  there there crooned the woman
dont you cry dear emmas right here
nobody can hurt you the dimpled pudgy
hands stroked the girls hair the words
the old familiar action took naomi back to
her childhood

 emma tell that man to go right down
and untie my garry just so had she
pouted many years ago and said emma
tell that boy to let my doll alone

  you john matson where have you got
her man tied up go let him free at once
or your life wont be worth living

  all right emm now that im sure this
young lady is who she said she was i
thought mebbe they was spies specially
when she asked for you

  spies you big fool couldnt you tell
this was my miss naomi now you just


wonder stories

  hustle right along and bring up her garry
  and rade perrin too added the girl
  but be careful that awful jeris farr doesnt
  get away

    matson strode away emma turned back
 to her mistress

    dearie what have they been doing to
 you youre so thin and worn looking
 ive worried myself sick over you where
 have you been all these months

    ive been on the moon nursie dear
  on the- an expression of alarm
  crossed the womans face quickly replaced
  by solicitude yes of course youve been
  on the moon now you just come with old
  emma and everything will be all right 
  but emma im not crazy i have been
  on the moon

    hush child dont excite yourself just
  be easy emmas here to take care of you

chapter xix

conquer or destroy

 n ee jumping jehosaphat i wish id
 vjt been with yez the boy jim burst
 forth as garry finished his sketchy outline
 of their adventures he had touched only
 the high spots being especially carefuly to
 avoid all mention of the ray-stone of ty-
 cho these people appeared friendly but
 there was no use taking unnecessary chances
 the safety of naomi perrin and himself
 the success of their mission the salvation of
 purtell and the others left behind on the
 moon depended on their utmost circum-
 spection

    the concrete cabin of the ranger was com-
  fortable the chillness that still lingered
  in the night-air at this high altitude was
  dissipated by the warm glow of a rad-chro-
  heater tapping the world-wide power waves
  that reached even this remote wilderness
  the same invisible source provided light
  too and heat for the gleaming cook-stove in
  the corner

a simple people they appeared the burly

	ranger and his wife julia a buxom coun-
 terpart of her sister emma two rangy
 apprentice lads jim tolley whom they had
 already met and mat fistel completed the

roll of the little outpost in the woods garry
studied them covertly as he talked would
they aid him

  his gaze shifted to naomi brave girl
she seemed ill at ease under the fluttering
attentions of her old nurse and maid months
of self-reliance had done that for her rade
was hunched over the heater his fine drawn
face pale his eyes two glowing coals that
followed naomis every move a livid welt
showed on his forehead where farrs blow
had landed

  jeris must be cold in that outhouse where
he had been taken blindfolded from the
ship what the devil could be done with
the fellow impossible to kill him in cold
blood yet living he was a constant men-
ace to their plans if he escaped again got
in touch with the aristocrats true he
would not know the exact location of the
rocket-ship matson had seen to that lead-
ing the blinkered rascal by devious routes
to the improvised prison he now occupied

  from the corner of his mouth matson
shot a brown stream of tobacco juice straight
into the moss-filled receptacle ten feet
away wall he drawled you fellows
have done a sight o scrappin and i guess
ive gotta believe that you have been to th
moon an back-but-tell me-how much
the farther have yez got seems to me that
the folks yez left up there are bound to die
o starvation an you three here-we kin
hide yez here fer a while but in th long
run yez must be found by the yella men
much as i hate to say it after the fight yez
have put up but it would have been better
had yez just lain down on that island and
let the gas kill yez

  garry came to a sudden decision these
people had hidden emma had shown every
desire to aid him and his companions thus
far why they had already involved them-
selves so deeply in defiance of the aristo-
crats that their lives were forfeit living here
in the great forest subject to a minimum
of supervision they were not as abject as
the great majority of the workers of the
world there was no servile bowing of
those straight shoulders frank eyes looked
straight at one when they talked he caught
exiles of

the moon



naomis eye a silent question a signalled
approval he plunged

  you would be right matson he said
gravely were it not for one thing on the
moon we found something thats going to
make it possible for us to challenge the
power of the aristocrats to demand free
pardon and safety for our comrades no
far more his eyes glowed as a vision rose
before them

  we have in our hands a weapon that
will enable us to force the aristocrats to
their knees that gives us the strength to de-
mand for all the workers their share of the
earths goods the little group right here
in this room can reform the world

  the peal of his ringing voice ceased a
silence fell john matsons eyes bored into
garrys an inscrutable mask had dropped
over his bronzed features at last he spoke
and strong emotion vibrated in his deep
slow voice

  you be not fooling-me man dont
dont tell me that tis a tissue o lies that
you spin to free our people from the iron
clutch o the masters to make o the
workers men again not slaves tis the
thing i have dreamed of these many years
as ive wandered through the clean-green
woods and watched even the very rabbits
play in the freedom that is denied to men

  he shook his head nay twill be of no
use i too have busied myself in plannin
foolish schemes o gatherin here in the wil-
derness a great army o workers but then
i wud go tuh the cities on my furlough
weeks and despair on the one side were
the aristocrats strong confident guarded
by the yellow police whom sadakuchi o
the samurai heads almost inhuman ma-
chines o destruction on the other an un-
armed mob o slaves why a full three-
quarters o the workers are beast-content
with their lot wud lift not a little finger to
battle for liberty an nine-tenths o the
rest are a flock o headless sheep ready to
run if an aristo so much as scowls at em
so id slink back to my trees and fergit my
dreams

  and now you come you tell me youve
bin to th moon you have a weapon that
the aristos cannot stand against mebbe

so mebbe so but you will not succeed
the workers will not stand by you no
matter how strong the weapon you place in
their hans they will not use it

  gary smiled bitterly you tell me
nothing i do not know already john even
with the little group i led those slave traits
you speak of have given me greater trouble
than the very enemies human and natural
from whom i have fought to save them
that fellow tied up outside is an example
but and his face showed grim and power-
ful this power we bring from the moon
needs no great army of workers no tre-
mendous uprising of slaves what i said
before i meant literally the little group
in this room unaided can defeat the aristo-
crats dictate a reformation of the world
we can conquer the earth or destroy it

midnight a full moon spread a sil-
very blanket of light over the tops
of the pine forest in the deep fastness of the
rockies apparently from the very side
of a craggy peak a man-bird soared a scar-
let arrow runabout with a black wc em-
blazoned on its nose naomi of the fen-
tons was again driving her gyrocopter hid-
den for half a year in a mountain cave care-
fully tended straight up into the new
york directional beam the whirling vanes
lifted its load-naomi garry rade-and
-black and mysterious under the seat-a
great metal box filled with white lumps of
the ray-stone of tycho

  wasnt it lucky garry that i had left
my old travelling robe in the plane

  garry looked fondly at his beloved once
more she wore the garb of an aristocrat
and his pulse leaped as he realized anew
that this exquisite girl had given up a life
of the utmost luxury for love of him

  the arrow reached the two-thousand foot
level leaped eastward as her automatic con-
trols caught the surge of the beam wave
for which they had been set

  beneath the rustling silver blanketed
tree-tops matson and jim and mat and
even the two women toiled the cautious
ranger skilled in the stratagems of the wild
had suggested that the ray-stone supply be
stowed away from the ship if the yel-


wonder stories

low men locate the ship then yez will still
have the ray-stone to battle with an if
they find the ray-stone then yez will have
the ship to go and git some more where-
as if yez leave the stone in the ship and they
find the ship-tis all over

  drum by drum tank by tank box by
box the long night through the five work-
ers carried the precious store through the
dark forest to the cave where the arrow had
been hidden

  all night the devoted five had worked
secure in the covering blanket of the forest
night at last matson swung a drum from
his huge shoulder to the dry floor of the
cave

  thats the last and its me thats glad
there be no more for the dawn light glim-
mers already in the east

  john

brush outside just before you came up this

house we can sleep but two hours then

bad if you should grow careless now after
all these months

	  

  the scarlet arrow hovered over the leap-
ing pinnacles of the great city just as the
false dawn grayed in the east the air was
almost deserted only the lone green patrol

ships soared here and there above the sleep-
ing metropolis a slant eyed flier in scar-
let glanced carelessly at the gyrocopter he
yawned that aristocrat woman was out
early or homing late really he should
hail her but he might get a wigging for his
pains that was a world councillors ship
-far be it from him to interfere with the
amours of the aristo women if the mas-
ters couldnt keep their women in order
twas no business of his

six months before he would have been
on the tail of that gyro in hurry a
confidential alarm with the personal signa-
ture of sadakuchi himself had ripped
through the air for just such a vessel as
this but that was a long time ago and
the sleepy patrolman had forgotten it so
he yawned again and looked searchingly
down at the police airport would that
damned relief of his never come

  the arrow drifted slowly down alight-
ed softly on the old familiar roof naomi
slipped from the vessel a whispered
careful dear came from beneath the cowl-
ing where garry and perrin crouched hid-
den she waved a careless hand belying
the trembling that shook her slight form

  had the settings of the alarm signals the
door seals been changed would they
rouse the house refuse her admittance
here was the crisis of the adventure

  she stepped into the guardian beams of
the elevator door her heart thumping as
though it was striving to betray her to
sound the alarm but the ornate gold por-
tal slid open-all was well as the silent
cage descended she thought of the last time
she had been in this moving chamber the
scene with her father her imprisonment
her escape lucky that only the door of
her suite had been barred against her she
must remember not to approach that cor-
ridor

	  

  to the two cramped in their hiding place
hours seemed to drag slowly by as they
waited damn it garry breathed in the
ear of his companion i shouldnt have let
her go suppose she is caught suppose
something happens-
exiles of the moon



  the boy stirred a bit shell take care
of herself mr parker shes wonderful
nothing can beat her

  i hope youre right god i hope so
and the two crouched silent again

  a soft step on the roof outside someone
climbing into the gyro the long awaited
voice everythings all right boys i left
the message and here-look what i have
for you

  the lifting vanes whirred through a cre-
scendo of power as garry and rade seized
the bundle thrust down to them two aris-
tocrat robes-the girl thought of every-
thing

  where now garry

  north above the city limits the old
ashokan reservoir that was drained when the
great aqueduct to the polar ice cap was
completed the pipe leading from it is a
tunnel thirty feet in diameter plenty of
room to hide plane and all in that

  ten minutes later the plane zoomed down
to the hiding place just as it disappeared
in the gaping aperture of the abandoned
duct a red sun poked its disk over the hor-
izon a superstitious police pilot view-
ing new york bathed in the red glow shud-
dered looks just like blood he mutter-
ed to himself something terrible is going to
happen	

	  

  henry of the fentons rose from the table
outside the day had clouded over was lead-
en dull dreary but there a flood of warm
simulated sunlight bathed the heaped flow-
ers gleamed from the crystal faceting of the
graceful breakfast service a young and
pretty worker woman her charms enhanced
by the orchid of the domestic service hov-
ered near unobtrusive but ready to serve
the world councillor no mechanical ser-
vants no synthetic food for the aristocrats
the art of fine living required human servi-
tors to add the last touch of finesse to lux-
ury

  a half year seemed to have aged henry
inordinately the hair above his temples
was fairly white now the wrinkles deeper
into the leather of his face sometimes
when he thought himself unobserved a
haunting sadness softened for a moment the

harsh lines but that lion head was as
stiffly erect that stern mouth as uncompro-
mising as ever

  the oligarch strode through a softly open-
ing panel in the wall this room from
which the western hemisphere was ruled
had no trace of luxury blank walls of
translucent glass a polished floor of oak
square in the centre a massive desk the
fenton started from the surface of that
desk which should be bare at this early
hour a yellow paper stared at him he
snatched it up

  to the world council he read

  we hold within our hands the power to
destroy the world

  at nine am eastern standard time we
shall demonstrate our power in the city of
new york

  at ten am we shall make known to you
our demands

  unless you accede to those demands we
shall proceed to make the earth uninhabit-
able

                     for the workers

the thick spatulate fingers clenched on
the paper for a moment he stared
rage suffusing his face with purple then
a thick voice snapped-tokisan

on the wall opposite appeared a scarlet
clad squat slant-eyed figure the captain
of the household guard what is it sir
someone entered this room last night
who was it

  no one sir there has been no alarm
you lie someone was here and left
this paper on my desk

  impossible sir i tested the seals my-
self after you left they were in order
there was no report of any disturbance dur-
ing the night if any one had forced the
door we should have known it any one
that is except you and- he hesitated
and who talk up you fool

  and-and the one whose name you have
forbidden us to mention

  my daughter were not the seals chang-
ed to bar her

  no sir

  why not someone will suffer for
that


wonder stories

  you gave no orders to that effect sir
henry of the fentons glared impossible
that she should have dared to enter this
house impossible

  place every worker in the house under
arrest the swift commands crackled
search every nook and cranny of the house
find out if anyone heard or saw anything
unusual report to me at once go

the figure disappeared from the screen
the world councillor picked up his com-
munication disk police headquarters
police headquarters came back the re-
ply 

  henry of the fentons give me general
yamurai at once

  sorry sir the general has just been
called to level one- something is wrong
down there ill try to get him for you as
quickly as possible

  what time is it

  nine-five sir

  from somewhere without came a dull
rumbling roar the room semed to vibrate
as if the great tower at whose pinnacle it
was had been suddenly struck by some tre-
mendous force

	  

  far underneath the city beneath even the
teeming industrial activity of level one
where the broad stream of the hudson flow-
ed in darkness to the sea the white beam
of a hand-flash lit momentarily the drip-
ping brick walls of the great rivers prison
an answering flash came from far ahead
scuttlings scrapings the startled squeal of
a water rat on the two-foot runway that
bordered the stream the flashes showed
again nearer to one another now two dim
forms met in blackness

  all right rade no trouble

  not a bit garry came the whispered
reply the aristocrat robe naomi got for
me sure worked wonders i heard some of
the workers curse as i passed i used to
do that myself when one of the inspectors
came through thats what they thought

i	was

  of course that was the idea the cops
wouldnt question you either got the ray-
stone placed

you bet i worked inward from a mile

away from the man-hole just as you sug-
gested by the time i reached it i could
already hear shouts coming from where i
started theyll never find the stones
plenty of places to hide them howd you
get along

  great

  theres only one thing that worries me
that stuffs going to hit the workers first
poor fellows

  i thought we thrashed that out last
night rade its unfortunate but some of
the workers will have to be sacrificed to the
common cause we couldnt warn them as
matson said ninety per cent of them are too
downtrodden too bestially content with con-
ditions to back us up theyd be sure to
give the whole thing away

  thats true but it seems tough

  its the way of the world my boy every
great reform has been purchased with the
blood and suffering of the very people
it benefited but enough of this you shoot
back to naomi and the gyrocopter go back
at once to mid-continent park and load up
with ray-stones then return just as fast as
you can make it

  ill hit for level three where the broad-
casters are i think i know a way to sneak
our demands through

  ill try to get back to ashokan by six
this evening but if something happens
and i dont show up distribute a double
quantity of the ray-stone to-morrow morn-
ing at nine

do you think the council will give in
not if i know them i expect well
have to give them another dose tomorrow

	  

  down in the rockies

  john john jim tolley was shouting
as he ran up the little glade where the mat-
son cabin stood john hes gone

  the big form of the ranger appeared in
the doorway whats that he grasped
the panting youth by the arm whats that
you say

  hes gone the prisoner got out
look he held up a frayed rope worked
this against the wall till he wore it through
theres blood here bet it took him all
night then he smashed the door dont
exiles of the moon



know what with maybe his shoulder hes
a powerful brute

  my god if he gets to the police were
done come on after him and pray were
in time damn good thing i took his com-
munication disk away

  matson leaped inside was out again in
a moment with his paralyzing tube told
mat to stay here look after the women
he snapped as the two loped through the
woods if the two of us cant get him
three cant

  the trail was easy to pick up farr was
no woodsman to glide through the forest
without leaving betraying marks he got
out just before dawn matson muttered
look the dew fell on these leaves after his
foot pressed them down but this moss was
already wet when he passed

  the trail points straight for the cave
where we hid the stone think hes hiding
there john

  mebbe i hope so but it looks to me
like he musta seen or heard something
yeah look here he stopped here for a
moment behind the tree sure theres my
tracks beyond and heres where he bedded
down watching us at the cave mouth the
woodsman was talking more to himself than
to his companion as he read the message
in the ground plainer to him than print

  the sonuvagun watched us but not
long he knows where the stone is then
how about the ship no see here it was
on my very last trip that he got here here
are all the other tracks beneath his foot-
prints thank god for that at least
now he angled away down the slope
come on jim weve got to hurry if he
kept on this way he ran right into the police
post down at the bottom of three forks
gorge

  kin we catch him

  dunno hes had an hours start
silently now the two slid through the
forest like two hounds on the scent of their
prey silently and fast but when at last
the trail debouched into a hillside clearing
the pursuers could see far below the pros-
trate figure of the fugitive tattered torn
bleeding-a scarlet clad policeman bend-
ing over him

  hell too late jims exclamation
was a groan

  mebbe not matsons face was grim
his paralysis projector up mebbe he aint
had time to say anything-a slither of in-
visible emanation the swarthy form be-
low quivered lay still sometimes death
resulted would it this time

  wonder how much he had time to tell
the grim-faced matson muttered as he turn-
ed to flee the scene

garry came out of the mouth of the
tunnel iqto a world of indescribable
confusion a furious blast of wind howled
past plucked at him with raging fingers
he snatched hold of an iron support pulled
himself back into the tunnel just in time to
avoid being hurled from his feet very cau-
tiously holding on he looked out again

  level one was a wreck a terrific cy-
clone roared and howled unimpeded down
the great corridors countless tons of air
hurtled by in a vain attempt to fill the
vacuum timbers chairs gyrocopters ta-
bles steel girders and vague darker shapes
that might be people scudded through the
murk torn loose from their moorings by
the swift impalpable air

  garry put out his hand it was almost
wrenched off by the pressure of the invis-
ible blast he received the impression of
a solid wall moving with incredible speed
it was hard to breathe even within the shel-
ter for the air swirled out to join the hur-
rying tide

  parker pressed the time button on his
wrist communication disk nine thirty-two
and a half intoned the central chrono-
meter broadcast so level three was still
unaffected by the catastrophic storm that
raged beneath it at least to the extent that
the broadcast systems were still intact that
was a relief only through their function-
ing could he hope to cut in with his ulti-
matum

  hell id never get there alive he mut-
tered to himself ill have to wait for this
to die down whew ive seen storms and
storms but they were mere babes compared
to this one wonder how long the ray-stone
will keep sucking up the air


wonder stories

  it was almost a half hour before his
question was answered garry watched the
interminable debris shooting past his place
of refuge heard the screaming chaos of that
stunned world

  then as abruptly as it had commenced
the great wind died to a faint whisper a
kaleidoscope of tossing wreckage crashed
heavily to the ground the storm was over
the cached ray-stone had reached the limit
of its absorption

  parkers ears still rang with the sudden-
ly stilled clamor when he ventured out into
an unfamiliar world level one was oblit-
erated under a tangle of twisted wreckage
here and there in the jumbled mass were
things that caused him to avert his eyes
quickly remorse welled within him all
these men had been killed by him just as
directly as though he had used a ray-gun
was the cause worth it

  yes he said angrily tc himself only
a few are slain of all the workers there
are myriads who some day would bless this
mornings work so he stilled his uneasy
conscience hurrying along the deserted cor-
ridor as fast as he could

  there was only five minutes to cut in on
the broadcasting from level three the
moving ways were out of commission no
doubt the spiral aseendors were also smash-
ed he dared not use the elevators the
whole avay would have to be made on foot

  in all his journeying through hurricane-
twisted level one not once did he come
upon the slightest sign of life he felt the
desolation more than on the reaches of the
moon there at least it was natural but
here it was man-made he garry had done
this

  he climbed painfully up the choked sta-
tionary ascendor into level two as he
swung out of the entrance into the common
amusement street once gay with cold light
radiance he found himself suddenly envel-
oped in a world of nightmarish shadows and
screams and thudding feet

  the long corridor ordinarily dedicated
to garish pleasures was filled with running
gesticulating workers a surging mob im-
pelled by panic fear flowing like a resist-
less tide-toward the aseendors to level

four a lank squint-eyed individual his
clothes awry a deep gash dripping blood
from his pasty face ran headlong into
garry

  garry braced himself under the blow and
cried angrily to his assailant here
whats the idea

  the worker shook himself clear his
squinting eyes were lit with madness with
stark unreasoning fear

  its cornin again i tell you at ten
oclock well all be wiped out the
aristos are killing us workers the lower
levels to be blown up up to level four
s our only chance

  and shouting unintelligently he ran on
others grim faced panic-stricken best-
ial were roaring by in a common flood
on to level four

  kill the bloody aristos

  i heard him say as plainly as i hear
you-ten oclock we let loose again

  its not enough to send us to the idlers
colonies-they want tuh get rid uv us all
at once

  and above the confused clamor rose a
steady ominous roar that became a welded
beating chant of hate

  kill the aristos kill kill

the workers were trapped rats turn-
ing at bay to snarl and snap at their
oppressors a revolution was under way-
unorganized desperate impelled by fear
and the sights of level one

  garry felt a fierce surge of exultation
the workers the meek submissive slaves
were aroused they thought the aristo-
crats had engineered the cataclysm below
had deliberately planned their extinction
he had not planned this but perhaps this
was the way out-destroy level four the
home of the aristocrats beat them to their
knees for a moment he envisioned him-
self the leader of this disorganized erup-
tion

  then cold reason descended on him
chilled him to the bone these poor devils
what could they do unarmed against the
discplined battalions of police that even
now were congregating on level four
ray-guns disintegrators paralyzing pro
exiles of the moon



jectors-why theyd sweep the attacking
horde into nothingness

 the howling berserk workers were
snatching up metal rods table legs every-
thing movable that might serve as a wea-
pon gleaming machines were torn to
pieces by frantic naked hands for the metal
pistons struts and rods then with one
voice the great flood roared on

  on to level four death to the aris-
tos

  garry awoke to the necessity of doing
something of stopping the inevitable
slaughter  he hurled himself into the push-
ing jostling mass head down fists and
elbows flying he transformed himself into
a human battering ram he must reach the
ascendor before too many of the madmen
had rushed to meet extinction at length
bruised battered bloody he found a pre-
carious foothold on the guard-rail over the
motionless ascendor

  balancing himself unsteadily he raised
his hand shouted to make himself heard
above the tumult of the strugglng mob

  friends workers he bellowed at the
top of his lungs you are mad insane
sadakuchis police are waiting for you in
level four theyll blast you into noth-
ingness not a man will survive down
with the aristocrats i say too but not this
way leave it to me i know a way to
beat them at their own game

  the great voice soared over stilling cries
as the workers paused at the sight of this
strange figure haranguing them a sea of
blood-stained faces garry exulted he
had them listening they would under-
stand

  then suddenly out of the uncanny calm
came a single angry shout its a bloody
aristo kill the-

  a roar went up the snarl of wolves
sniffing blood a tossing ocean of weapons
of insane fists garry looked at his still
outstretched arm in a spasm of horror he
still had on his aristocrat cloak then the
furious mob was upon him

  he was torn off his perch went under a
storm of blows and clawing fingers that
sought to tear him into little bits a myriad
feet stamped and pounded on him still

fighting garry gave hmself up for lost he
wriggled and squirmed warded off as best
he could the hail of fists and legs

  then there was a surge over and beyond
him ten oclock- the cry went up-
let us through level two is going to be
blown up

  in an ecstasy of fear the combatants for-
got their victim shoved in stark panic up
the ascendor trampling each other in their
mad rush to be out of the doomed area be-
fore the expected blow of the aristos fell

  somehow garry managed to totter to his
feet he was engulfed swallowed up a
helpless chip tossed aloft in the vast flood
up ever up the rush carried him past
level three that was a hazy glimpse of
power and television units onto the choked
ascendor to level four

  a last surge and he was spewed out into
the ordered magnificence of the abode of
the aristocrats garry just had time to
envision the great crystal palaces the lovely
gardens on this roof of their world as the
maddened workers spread out in a disor-
derly flood when he saw something straight
ahead	

  the police ranks on ranks of them
yellow men trim disciplined silent a
single officer stood coolly in front survey-
ing the erupting workers

  the mob was crazy now the pushing
driving fear from below and the sight of
the hated police ahead awoke frenzied rage
in their breasts with cries of execration
and hideous blasphemes they rushed upon
the waiting foe

garry saw the arm of the officer go
up he knew what that meant heed-
less of being trampled he threw himself
flat on the ground above his quivering
back he felt a stab of searing heat the
ray guns

  screams of anguish wails of fear and
glowing twisted bodies fell in heaps all over
the crystal surface garry was submerged
in a deluge of smoldering forms

  then above the piteous cries of the tor-
tured rose a fierce animal-like shout he
twisted and gasped his way from under
the charred bodies


wonder stories

  the great crystal level was a seething
mass of fighting clawing men the work-
ers in their multitdinous numbers had
broken the ranks of the police

  a thrill ran through garry though he
knew it was suicide though he knew the
police would reform and mow down the
embattled workers he could not restrain
himself with a wild cry that sounded
strange in his ears he hurled himself into
the fray

  what followed was forever dim in his
memory somewhere he snatched up a
steel rod he saw a policeman levelling
his deadly ray-gun a crash of the heavy
rod and down went the yellow man in a
tangle of gore

  garry went mad utterly triumphantly
mad his bloody weapon swung and
crashed men dropped their cudgels sprang
upon the police to hammer them with bare
fists to strangle them with animal snarls

   but slowly inevitably the police reform-
ed garry had a glimpse of a cold unflust-
ered aloof oriental a single star on his
shoulder strap issuing calm commands into
his communication disk sadakuchi park-
er saw red rushed for him he collided
heavily with another worker stumbled and
fell that saved his life

  a withering blast from ray-guns disin-
tegrators swept the crystal plain a para-
lyzing beam deflected somehow caught him
he sank into unconsciousness

	 

   as he weltered out of the influence of the
ray he heard a murmur of voices faint
far-off at first then clearer

  hello heres an aristocrat howd he
get here

  thats funny thought they were all hid-
ing in their palaces leaving the dirty work
to us

  garrys eyes opened slowly

  sssh a warning hiss

  it was ludicrous to see two members of
the police jumping to attention all over
the great area were strangely contorted
piles of bodies not a live worker was to
be seen the police in little groupe were
searching methodically

   are you hurt sir there was a note
 of respectful solicitation in the officers

 voice

   garry shook his head weakly now he
 thanked his stars for the aristocrat cloak-
 a wounded worker would get short shrift
 perhaps they would let him go

   but his hopes were dashed

   thats very good sir would you be
 gracious enough to accompany us

   strong arms set him on his feet gently

   garry simulated the haughty indignation
 of an aristocrat

  what do you mean accompany you
 you are overbold- sirrahs i go my own
 way he said cuttingly

   sorry sir but those are our orders
 from the chief himself everyone found
 alive must be brought before him res-
 pectful but insistent

   garry darted a hasty glance around not
 a chance for escape

   very well if i must but youll regret
 this outrage

   i cant help it sir the policeman said
 doggedly

   with a sinking heart he was led through
 a welter of blasted bodies over to where the
 single-starred officer was standing he
 racked his brain furiously but there seemed
 no way out of his predicament where
 were naomi and rade-were they safe
 theyd have to carry on

   sadakuchi surveyed him coldly a squat
 high-cheeked oriental with an arrogant air
 and a cruel droop to his lips

  what have you here he purred to
 garrys escort

   one of them explained an aristocrat
 your excellency whom we found lying amid
 the workers-caught by a paralyzing ray
 evidently

   an aristocrat hmm garry felt the
 slant black eyes boring into him he
 steeled himself for the ordeal

   unexpectedly sadakuchis arm shot out
 ripped open the collar of parkers robe
 garry started forward but the police grip-
 ped him hauled him back

   a supercilious sneer spread over the
 police chiefs sleek countenance while
exiles of the moon



garry raged and struggled

  just as i thought-a worker masquer-
ading

on garrys chest as on the chests of all
workers there had been indelibly im-
pressed at maturity his number

  what is your name the arrogant
command snapped at him parker was sil-
ent

  a rebellious dog well soon make you
talk hufan he spoke low into the
communication disk bring me the work-
ers register-c file

  sadakuchi turned away as though he had
forgotten the prisoners existence garry
strained to get at him just one free mo-
ment he panted and hed be satisfied even
if death would follow inevitably but the
encompassing arms were too strong

  a gyrocopter whipped through the air
settled down slowly a policeman jumped
out with a fat volume and handed it res-
pectfully to his chief

  sadakuchi turned the thin metal leaves
ah here we are-c garry park-
er rocket pilot

  a subtle sneer enveloped his features

  so you are garry parker he said con-
temptuously most interesting indeed
naomi of the fentons must have gone mad
to take up with a slave like you he
motioned to the waiting police take him
to the gaol ill attend to him later

  and while garry was being dragged
away shouting threats and objurgations
sadakuchi meditated

	 

  henry of the fentons sat glowering before
his desk in grim silence he stared straight
ahead where in place of what had been a
blank wall of translucent glass appeared a

vast and moving panorama there was be-
ing depicted the maelstrom of wild fury
the mad onslaught of the fear-ridden work-
ers the cold battling of the scarlet police
the flashing ray-tubes of destruction all the
chaotic scene of the metropolis so clearly
limned that the watcher seemed in the midst
of it the clamor and turmoil filled the
room the shrieks of the dying the crisp
commands of the police officers the hoarse
shouting of the rioting workers mingling
and merging into an indescribable contin-
uous roar that was the voice of the mob a
tortured face loomed large on the screen
crazed eyes stared out at the obligarch a
shriek of agony-and the face melted into
nothingness impassive no sign of emotion
on the cold mask of his face henry sat and
watched

  a thought seemed to strike the fenton
his hand went out touched a button on the
desk the noise was stilled in silent panto-
mime the pictured conflict continued he
spoke quietly into the diamond communica-
tion disk

  anton

  yes sir the suave voice of his sec-
retary responded

  call a council meeting for a half-hour
from now i think this will bring salis-
bury and na-jomba around to my idea that
the idle workers must be donb away with
very good sir came the non-committal
reply council meeting thirty minutes
from now

  i shall be here switch them right on
the screens without bothering to notify me
yes sir

  that will be all

transmutation

editor science questions and anstoers

  has the transmutation of elements ever been  per-
formed successfully artificially is this likely to lead to
the release of inter-atomic energy  if so how can it be
done i know that radium disintegrates automatically
into lead but this is a natural process what i want
to know is hns the transmutation ever been accom-

  the distinguished english scientist sir ernest ruth-
erford did succeed in causing transmutation in what
sir oliver callcd one of the most remarkable experi-
ments made by man

  rutherford had the belief that if he could bombard
th nucleus of an atom he could break down the nucleus
and from that disintegration complete atoms of another
substance would be released he knew for example
that the nucleus of the nitrogen atom contained  pro-
tons and  electrons which balances the  electrons
which revolve about the nucleus

  since the hydrogen atom consists of one proton and
one electron rutherford saw that the nitrogen nucleus
consisted of the building blockb for a nwnber of hydro-
gen atoms if he could break down the nucleus the
electrons and protons would naturally cling together
in pairs and hydrogen atoms would result

  rutherfords problem was to find a method of bom-
bardment that would be effective he utilized radium
the gamma rays shooting off at a speed of several
thousand miles per second acting as projectiles af unu-
sual power his experimentat least on the laboratory
scale was a success although the minute nitrogen



nuclei were very difficult to hit thousands of hits by
the radium projectiles did occur and hydrogen flew out
of the nitrogen

  naturally no power was obtained from this experi-
ment in fact energy the kinetic energy of the rad-
ium projectile had to be supplied in order to effect the
transihutation but rutherfords experiments do indi-
cate that transmutation is no idle dream the only
question at issue is what is the cost and what do we
get from it-editor

editor science questions and answers

  i read with interest the questions that e y ander-
son asked and your answers in the august number
on page  and also studied diagrams

  those diagrams however brings up another question
and that is-do we ever see the actual position of any
star

  take for example a star whoso light would take a
year to reach our earth and during that time that star
has traveled  miles wouldnt that star bo a
 miles from where we think that we see it

  mr michels point is very well taken stare are
continually moving and naturally if it takes years for
their light to reach us they have altered their posi-
tions considerably in the interim but for most stars
this change in position is not apparent to us the
stars are so very far away that even their motion

during years is insufficient to show any appreciable
change in their position to us

  it is stated by astronomers in fact that there are
less than  stars that change their positions in the
leavens due to their motion by one second of arc per
year and this motion is equivalent to that of the
thickness of a thread seen at five hundred feet the
greatest proper motion recorded for a star is for v s
which moves nine scconds of arc per year

  consider for example a star at the distance of
alpha ccntauri which is one of the nearest stars to
the solar system alpha centauri is at a distance of
 miles from us let us assume that
it has a proper motion as fast as  miles a second
then in four years it would have moved 
miles

  but this movement atalpha centnurts great dis-
tance from us is equivalent to the motion of only one
inch seen at a distance of  feet the star for all
practical purposes is therefore fixed-editor

the dinosaur

editor science questions and answers

  your writers have often mentioned great prehistoric
animals in their stories-such as the dinosaur did
these animals really exist what did they really look
like and how large were they i would appreciate an
answer from you and if possible some sort of an illus
tration of one of the beasts

                      harvey j wright

                       sandpoint idaho

  dinosaurs did actually exist and roamed the earth
some  years ago they were the largest of
carnivorous animals and they lived during the age of
reptiles in the company of giant crocodiles and turtles
flying reptiles and the great iguanas

  it is quite possible that the beasts were so large that
they were not quick nor mobile enough to fight out the
struggle for existence in a world of constantly changing
conditions they perished but their fossilized remains
have been discovered and reconstructed into n sem-
blance of the originals the illustration herewith gives
some idea of their size and the general appearance
of the skeleton-editor

  the term combustion means burning-the com-
bination of a substance with another substance such
as oxygen or chlorine etc to produce light and heat

  combustion involves only a chemical change in which
light and heat are given off and the molecules-not the
atoms-are changed in the process

  thus in the burning of coal-when coal or carbon ia
united with oxygen and heat is applied sufficient to
start the combustion-the carbon and oxygen molecules
are united their identity destroyed and a gas carbon
dioxide is formed

  once the combustion has started if it can produce
sufficient heat it will cause the combustion of more
oxygen and carbon and be spread through the whole
mass of the coal in brief the very combustion of a
molecule of carbon and one of oxygen provides sufficient
heat to start the combustion of two more molecules

  the atoms of carbon and oxygen are not destroyed
if the proper process is used the carbon dioxide can be
broken down and oxygen and carbon obtained again

  combustion is therefore quite different from the
breaking down of actual atoms in order to release their
energy combustion is simply a chemical combination
of substances that yields heat and light the fire that
accompanies combustion is only the luminous heated
particles-editor

editor science questions and answers

  what is really fire or rather what is really combus-
tion and how does it come about that the molecules
if not the atoms of a body are apparently destroyed
or scattered and transformed

  in other words how does destruction or transforma-
tion take place and propagate itself from molecules
to molecules after the first one is ignited i was
almost going to say contaminated by that unknown
destruction

why has such destruction of bodies been used solely
to generate heat in other bodies from which power is
created instead of utilizing that original destruction
or disintegration to create a more tremendous force

a form of energy

editor wonder stories

  for several months an interesting but unfruitful
discussion of time travelling has been going on read-
ers and authors alike have been submitting all kinds
of thoughts about this subject the sum total of these
thoughts being practically nothing

  the reason for this lies with both authors and read-
ers especially with the former since it is they who
supply most of the ideas about time travelling dis-
cussed in the reader speaks column without giving
satisfactory explanations of those ideas most authors
are content to invent time machines of all sizes and
shapes without attempting to describe their operation
this chey leave to the readers imagination and if his
imagination happens to be poor the story may be
spoiled as far as he is concerned henry f kirkham
for instance enters into an exceedingly long-winded
supposed explanation of the time machine in his story
tho time oscillator which conveys very little to the
mind of the reader and merely fills space

  almost all authors consider time as being a dimen-
sion preferably the fourth it appears to me that
these authors have not thought very much about time
for if they had they would not have chosen the fourth
or any other dimension as the time dimension the
reason is that if time is imagined to be a dimension
it becomes part of space i the leading phy-
sicists of today believe that time and space are separate
and different therefore when a writer who is writ-
ing a time travelling story seeks a scientific background
for it whose views should he accept his own or those
of the bright lights in the field of science there is
only one answer yet authors persist in employing
their own often incorrect ideas

  the point i wish to emphasize is that all time travel-
ling stories ever written would have been more satis-
factory more interesting and far more logical if the
authors had considered time as being not a dimension
but as being a form of energy i

  mr kirkham however seems to be definitely at
fault in one place it is obviously impossible for a
thing to exist before it begins to do so yet in mr
kirkhams time oscillator the time machine which
was completed some time after  ad goes back
to several thousand years bc at the time of atlan-
tis the metal used in the time machine was lying in the
ground in the form of ore it could not possibly exist
in the machine in the form of steel or some such
metal at the same time that it was in the ground as ore
this same error is true of other authors i suppose
the sole reply to this accusation is that the author of a
science fiction story may do as he pleases merely be-
cause it is fiction not fact

  in my humble opinion the only time travelling story
published in wonder stories which was worth
the paper it was printed upon was dr breuers
fitzgerald contraction the value of this storys
plot was greatly enhanced by the large amount of fact
in the story altogether too many stories time travel-
ling and otherwise contain too little science to warrant
their being called science fiction many of them being
just glorified wild west stories

  as for paradoxes here is a fairly good one if a
man travels into the future to see how he is to die
he will not find out until the moment of his death it
will then be too late for him to turn back and con-
sequently he will expire the question is if someone
sends tlie time machine with the corpse in it back ten
years will the man come back to life or will he remain
dead if he revives nature will be cheated as he has

already died but if he does not revive he will be
dead ten years before he died i again nature will bo
cheated 

  i would bo extremely pleased to continue this dis-
cussion with anyone who might care to communicate
with me

                     bronx n y

  mr kaletsky makes an indictment against authors
of time travelling stories that they will have to answer
to clear themselves before the judgment board of our
readers we invite our authors therefore to come
forward and explain away mr kaletskys accusations

  we do not insist in our editorial policy that a story
must have a terrific amount of scientific detail but we
do ask that it have enough to make it plausible we
received a story from an excellent writer the scientific
idea was quite original and novel but although the
writer used considerable scientific detail to explain it
the editors never became convinced that the device
was plausible the story was not accepted

  each screw or bolt on a machine does not have to
be described but the net effect of a writers description
must be that the reador will say at the end yes this
could exist

  as for the paradox it would certainly be a mixed
up state of affairs if what mr kaletsky relates should
occur-editor

  tho announcement of the cloud projector following

  mr glassers letter shows a highly developed interest
in the work that i believe this magazine stands for
the human anra is so much a fact to those that have
developed as the scent of flowers are to those who have
keen sense of smell both are vibrations just as radio
waves and sound waves-they must have the proper
instruments or they pass undetected

  to a deaf person sounds are not recorded in the
brain so of course they cannot prove that sound exists
to those whose pineal glands are developed vibrations
not recorded by others make impressions on the con-
sciousness

  my own experience shows that by the abstinence
from the eating of flesh coffee tobacco narcotics
white flour and other highly starched products refined
sugar and alcoholic beverages and food combinations
that set up toxic conditions in the system my sense
perceptions have become keener to these vibrations of
higher waves the aura does exist to those who can
see it and telepathy exists to those developed to receive
by the inner ear

  mrs harris letter shows a start in the right direc-
tion it seems to me that our amusements could bo
made much more interesting by some science fiction
introduced into motion pictures i suggest wo all take
our lady authors advice aud write to film companies
asking for a few real pictures

  some day a colony can be started like the lano
cooperative colony in louisiana there persons inter-
ested in scientific development live and assist each
other and try to erect a state  years ahead of our
ordinary life science mould rule in every depart-
ment and new ideas transmitted to the outside world
with a scientific diet agriculture housing and coopera-
tion a new civilizatiou could be started perhaps
an idea of this sort is underway already

  we agree with mr stockham that many people
have benses so highly developed that they can see and
hear and feel things that ordinary people can not we
think that no scientist no matter how conservative will
not agree to this statement also

  the question is do these people really see things or
are they in such a physical and mental aud emotional
state that visions appear to them

  now it is impossible to tell whose vision is truthful
the vision of the ninety-nine or that of the one a man
by fasting or by a certain diet or by being aroused
to an emotional intensity can see things just as clearly
perhaps even more so than people in ordinary health
and in an ordinary frame of inind science is just
beginning to realize how important is the state of our
being on what we sec hear feel aud think

  a man or woman under the influence of a great fear
may be positive that he sees someone following him
along a dark street he may hear perfectly clear the
footsteps of the pursuer  even though it is dark he may
see the clothing worn by the pursuer now does he
really see these things

  what we mean to say is that our mental world in-
cludes all kinds of states in some of them we do have
great clarity of vision and can really see things that
people in an ordinary state cannot in other conditions
we think we see things but they may be only mental
visions

  if the lano cooperative colony really exists we would
like to know more about it it sounda interesting-

make a deity of mathematics

editor wonder stories

  since my comment and query on the lorentz-fitz-
geruld contraction seems to have started quite a little
discussion i feel it is time to horn in again with
an explanation and more comment

  to begin with i will udmit  was struck with the
story possibilities of an infinite gravitational mass
hence my query to dr breuer who can be counted
upon to know what be is talking about his not
knowing indicates quite strongly that the question has
not been dealt with

  let us decide that it is tho inertia of a body equiv-
alent to its mass at low speeds that approaches in-
finity as the velocity of light as dr breuer says
equations are shorthand for fact and are not to be
regarded as sorcery

  this is certainly true of classical equations though
the modern physics is getting to be very largely
physics with the fact following the equation and
some of the greate-st physicists make a very respect-
able deity of mathematics i lean in this direction
myself but dr breuer takes the common-sense atti-
tude which will probably get him further than our
blind faith in figures

  all of our physical laws expressed in equations
represent tendencies as nearly as we can tell the
world behaves as they indicate for all purposes when
we have a large krror-a large factor of safety-they
hold but when we measure closer when we delve
into the realm of the small and particularly of the
few something goes wrong with our equations our
gods have fallen and we promptly grab new ones out
of the air which do all the old ones did and more

  all the old staid laws and equations of classical
physics can be deduced frjjm the freakish modern
laws by neglecting details and taking things as a
whole and in the long run

  newtons laws tell you how a ball will run down
a groove but they cant begin to say what happens
to the molecules of that ball much less to its atoms
and electrons the new physics is trying to do
that and physicists find roughly that taking the
molecules as a group seems to be just a wee bit dif-
ferent than taking the ball as a unit

  consequently they choose the equation that does
the most work and dig in again and like the men-
acing robots of-the science fiction writer the equa-
tions have a tendency to take over the controls and
give birth to others while tho physicists sit by and
gape in wonder

  whenever he begins to get entirely lost he just
shuts oft the power and takes stock until he is sure
his brain children arent running away with him
right now were in the midst of a spurt and since
science seems to be rather democratic nowadays some
physicists are trying to take stock at the same time
you can get gloriously drunk on modern physics but
if you dont watch your step youre in the gutter in-
stead of the life of the party

  reaching the july issue i cant quite see why an
infinite universe with an infinite mass in every direc-
tion pulling with an infinite force should prohibit the
solar system forces in all directions would quite
effectively kill each other off-a cosmic tug of war i
think an infinite universe shocks our imagination
much more than our reason  gravitational attraction
can cause a dispersed system to contract toward its
center of gravity where that is located in an infin-
ite system is beyond me if the universe is limited
that is something else again and it is quite possible
that it may expand or contract

  some of the modern theories require that it do so
observation seems to show some such expansion but
as the  editor has so nicely pointed outso far as we
are concerned the most violent of explosions hurling
every star to infinity would be beyond our ability to
detect aside from these details in which i may be
wrong mr evans letter and the editors comment
just about fill the bill

                      scotia new york

  we are glad that mr miller recognizes the alco-
holic content of modern physics the best explana-
tion of it all was provided by n young philosopher
many years ago in his book the philosophy of tse
as if his contention was that we had built our
science upon the premise that certain phenomena
might be true we recognized he said that they did
not act as our equations indicated but we ignored

the reader speaks

continued from page 

the difference for science was then in the grip
of materialism and equations had to be constructed so
that science might have a practical application

  now two forces have killed this voluntary blind-
ness we have gone so far in the practical applica-
tion of science that we must have now more precise
explanations second science is escaping from mater-
ialism and becoming instead of a tool to the prac-
tical an art in itself modern physicists dont give
a hang if their theories never are used they present
the truth and they are finished-editor

the only way to exist

 editor wonder stories

   when my first years subscription expired for won
 der stories i did not renew it i preferred to
 watch the outcome of the struggle of the magazine to 
 higher plane i want to tell you that i am satisfied
 again with wonder stories and that it is at pres-
 ent high in my estimation

   and ill tell you why i the covers are almost uni-
 formly good thanks to paul why dont you keep
 paul as a standard and allow no lower grade of illus-
 trations to enter wonder stories i speak of
 marchioni especially i am partial to impressionism
 but he seems to be realistic in a stilted way

   suggestion in the little note after each title in the
 table of contents why not have a connected sentence
 your broken phrases are really not attractive the
 stories themselves are usuallv interesting the world
 within was exceptionally fine althongh less interest-
 ing than its predecessor in my opinion the latter waa
 more stereotyped

   either cut down on the editorial note on each story
 or make them more interesting also please tell jack
 williamson not to sacrifice quality for quantity he
 could approach his earlier high-water mark if he took
 more time

   this doesnt seem to show why i approve of won-
 der stories but all the rest of the magazine is fine

   heres my contribution to the time travelling mix-
 up in worlds to barter the men from the future
 called a come to the men of the present b and
 change places with them well and good yet when
 in the natural course of time the descendants of the
 a people reach a point in time where the as them-
 selves were born what would happen the ab
 wouldnt be born of course because their natural par-
 ents would not exiet yet if they werent born their
 descendants wouldnt exist and thus would admit tho
 existence of tho as natural parents so the only way
 these men from the future could exist except by leav-
 ing no descendants is by not being born

                         los angeles california

   mr kuttner does pose a paradox no doubt it
 would be very confusing to have the descendants of a
 reach a time when they found their world perhaps even
 their space occupied by a totally strange race barr-
 ing the situation of having tho a race die out in tho
 meantime there seems to be no way out of the tangle

   we must call for help from the time travelling ex-
 perts among our readers what can be done to avoid
 this terrible calamity-editor

ranks among the best

 editor wonder stories

   once in a while you print a story which stands
 out such a one is rebellion  ad in
 wonder stories for july  it should rank
 among the best things you have yet published

   your june editorial and mr glassers letter in the
 august number on the human aura are very interesting
 and i hope the subject will be followed up with scien-
 tific care about three years ago i ran across a book
 printed in england on this subject-it called it the
 human atmosphere it was written by a man who
 called himself an electrical engineer and in no sense
 an occultist he stated that after experimentation
 ho had succeeded in seeing the human atmosphere with
 the naked eye against tho light through sensitized
 screens later i noticed some advertisements offering
 such screens for sale but have heard nothing further
wonder stories



 about them it may be that tho book i saw is the
 same as that to which you refer in your editorial

  why not put the word science back in tho
title to the magazine seems to me it belongs there

  while we have no definite information on the
screen mr morgan refers to we have our doubts about
the value of such a device for seeing a possible aura
it would be comparatively simple to make a screen
that would appear to surround a person with an aura
if the aufa business is worth anything it cannot bo
settled by merely having some sort of color filter as
tho screen appears to be-editor

in defense of authors

editor wonder stories

  this is just a letter in defense of sehachner and
zagats the emperor of the stars i noticed in
flie july issue a rather sarcastic comment about the
blue space of the new universe i only hope mr
pancoust has not thrown his april issue away if he
will go through it again i think he will notice that it
was the quartz sphere which was supposed to light
this universe

  it mentions that while the prostaks communicated
by thought with the other worlds they had never seen
them until tho arrival of the sphere also when the
sphere was blown up the light disappeared and the
men were wondering how they could pet to one of
these worlds when they were projected into their own
universe i hope this will relieve mr pancoasts
doubts

  i am a rather new reader but greatly enjoy your
stories this is the first letter i have written so far

  i just finished the august issue the time pro-
jector ended well i think venus mines inc was
very good also as was the th millennium
twelve hours to live is a puzzler all right the
other two the island of giants and the world
within i did not care so mucli for

  authors are so much browbeaten by readers that
its good to have a reader come to their defense occa-
sionally the job of the writer is hard he must
exorcise his imagination to the limit yet picture things
realistically and yet construct around the science
and the product of his imagination a corking good
story those of our readers whs have tried to write
bcitnce fiction will realize how hard it is

  naturally writers do slip up occasionally even the
best of them and although they want to bo told
about their breaches readers must remember that its
practically impossible to visualize an entirely new
world and have each detail perfectly consistent

  read the various newspaper accounts of some event
and it will be discovered that ofx six reporters seeing
exactly tho same thing no two will describe it alike

will really be a menace

editor wonder stories

in regard to mr gcrnsbacks illuminating editorial

i	would like to say that he omitted one important
development of the machine age namely-the robot
the possibilities of this machine seem small and in-
significant but when considered carefully assume ter-
rifying proportions the robot at the present time is
an awkward inefficient object but with development
is slowly being made more and more efficient even
tually it is quite certain that the robot will be the
equal of most unskilled and some skilled labor when
that time comes the machine age will really bo a men-
ace to society even to civilization because of a factor
which mr gernsback emphasizes in his article the
factor of human nature

  the average wage of a factory worker is about
fifteen hundred dollars per year with the perfection
of the robot will come mass production of the robot
with mass production will oome a decline in price as
occurred in other industries it would pay an enter-

firising capitalist to replace his human labor by mach-
nes for the machine will cost less than the salary of a
worker over a short time will work constantly will
not join unions or ask for a raise in wages

it is reasonable to assume that many perhaps most
employers folllowing the dictates of every human

beings desire for money will purchase those machines
which can produce for them so much more cheaply
but this attempt to save will prove to be a double-
edged sword the more machines used tho greater the
unemployment of human labor which will result in a
decrease in demand manufacturers will find them-
selves forced to shut down their factories and lose what
they intended to gain

  robots if used with discretion would benefit tho
world greatly by an arrangement whereby the work-
ing man works two hours a day and the robot tho
remainder such a system provided that the working
man still had his former income would free him to
pursue educational and cultural arts i need not go
into the benefits of this they are self-evident

  but will such a system ever be established pro-
bably not unless some scientist inspired by science
fiction perhaps perfects an elixir which will remove
the traits of greed and selfishness from the human
race then aud only then will a utopia be possible

  mr gernsback is of course very well aware of
the robot and he has as a matter of fact written
exhaustively for the past fifteen years on just this
phase one of his own inventions was a police auto-
maton and a number of others of the same class
one point of importance that the average man does
not realize however is that the word robot is usu-
ally misconstrued

  popularly the robot is supposed to be a man-liko
machine that walks on its feet and performs all sorts
of manual work while it may be possible in a hun-
dred thousand years hence to have a mechanical man
who performs simple tasks it will manifestly remain
impossible even then to have for instance to mention
one of thousands-a robot cook not by the widest
stretch of imagination can you think of a robot which
could cook an entire meal all by itself without the
human agency entering the work

  the robot of science fiction has as a rule no coun-
terpart in actual practice on the other hand we
have real robots around us right now and have had
them for some years the technical robot is a machine
that performs certain single or more or less compli-
cated tasks and does them much better than tho hu-
man being such a robot for instance is the auto-
matic telephone the machine replaces the telephone
operator and incidentally never makes  mistake

  any adding or calculating machine is a most effi-
cient robot so are the hundreds of so-called business
machines so is the automatic press which prints a
complete newspaper merely by the press of a button
a great deal of the ford motor works arc robotized
these are but a few examples and there are in use
today many thousands of efficient robots and they
have been in use for a number of years the trouble
however never lies with the robot but with tho hu-
man beings and this is what our correspondent points
out only when the machines over-produce do the
human beings suffer it is not a matter of controlling
the machine but rather of controlling the greediness
of humanity-editor

the gambler

   he gambles that a lucky break will
   come to him in the course of time

most men live in the hope that their lucky break wiu
come tomorrow or next week or next year

they gamble that fate some day some way will make
them rich they risk their whole lives on what may come to
them in the course of time

    this is a worse form of gambling than gambling for
money with a card sharp or a three shell game expert

    gambling on what time and fate have in store for you
is more costly than any other form of gambling known

   you lose more than money you lose your self-
respect you lose the self-respect of those about you

    and as each year passes your chance to amount to any-
thing becomes slimmer and slimmer

    you get discouraged you begin to feel that fate is against
you you complain secretly about your ill luck perhaps you hide
your shortcomings behind a whole flock of easy excuses

     but the hard cold world doesnt care about you

    youve got to look out for yourself

    time alone cannot help you if it could every man over
 would be rich

    you cannot count on luck or fate or circumstances if you
could everybody would get rich at some time or other

    your life is too precious to waste away waiting for some-
thing to turn up

   theres one sure way-yes only one sure way-to
get what you want out of life

    nothing can help you but your own brain make your brain
just a little bit more effective and you will multiply your
earning power

    there is no limit to what the human brain can accomplish
scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about ten per
cent of our brain power ninety per cent is unused it lies
dormant the longer it is unused the harder it becomes for us
to use it for the mind is like a muscle it grows in power
through exercise and use it weakens and deteriorates with
idleness

    what can you do about it that is the question you are
asking yourself here is a suggestion
