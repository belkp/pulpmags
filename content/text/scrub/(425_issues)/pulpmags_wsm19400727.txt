the
roundup

  with plans for vacations in the
air were inclined to be a bit dreamy-
eyed and away in the mind these
warm summer days particularly
when we receive a letter like the one
we reprint here from harry f olm-
sted who is taking his annual jaunt
in the southwest harry writes

  new mexico is beautiful at this
time of the year-hot days cool
nights and the verdure showing the
effects of the winter moisture the
cactus is in bloom and some of it
is very beautiful i brought in one
yesterday to plant at dean kirks
new trading post that had seventy-
five blood-red blooms

  it has not been a very good year
-little rain and not much snow
last year was total drought and the
indian corn crop was a failure the
result is a total lack of seed corn-
and a navaho will as soon sleep in
a haunted chindi hogan as plant
or eat the white mans superior
corn so few are planting but such
as have seed are busy in their fields
using much the same technique their
forefathers used here as far back as
the year 

  thunder and lightning today

with a little rain and what a dis-
play the southwestern skies put
forth the indians will soon start
their rain dances for the season is
a full month ahead of schedule a
fascinating country this one which
goes far to restore me after an
overly long period at the typewriter

  we know our readers join us in
hoping that harry enjoys his well-
earned rest and we feel certain that
hell collect a wealth of material for
future colorful and fascinating yarns
for western story

  and now wrote daniel s gage
some time ago referring to a story
by tom roan in our april th issue
we have another utterly silly and
fool mess of words gun ghosts
from boothill why inflict on us
such nonsense stories which picture
real life-which are possible-are
literature-such nonsense as this
story is just drivel

  defending ourselves we wrote
friend gage that this type of story
has become tremendously popular
with our readers judging from the
fan mail received the concensus of
opinion seemed to be that not only
was it exciting as well as entertain-
ing but was something different-a
departure from the usual run-of-the-
mine situations which have been
written about time and again

  we reprint mr gages reply here-
with because we consider it highly


street  smiths western story

interesting mr gage has this to
say

  your letter in reply to mine
criticizing gun ghosts from boot-
hill is at hand no doubt many
readers like such stories it takes all
kinds to make a world but i think
it more likely that those who like
something are apt to tell you so than
those who dislike it it is not very
agreeable to find fault

  reminds me of when max brand
first began to write for the western
magazines of all the crazy tales
his took the cake horses galloping
at full speed for hours without rest
dogs doing utterly impossible stunts
and men just behaving as if he were
writing a fairy tale but probably
you recall them i think in the end
the majority of readers tired of them
as to whether such a story as gun
ghosts could have happened maybe
it could have in some unheard-of
place but you must admit it is
utterly improbable and there is no
good literature which deals in im-
probabilities

   i have defended the type of story
in the westerns on the ground that
they do picture life as one can hardly
find it elsewhere i have often dis-
cussed with our professors of english
here whether they might not have
their classes read some such writings
whether these stories could be ex-
pected to rank as literature with
dickens eliot and others is not the
question but the fact is that they
are read widely and they and other
similar writings would be a valuable
study of the mind of many readers
but the professors rejoin that such a
study might be all right from the
standpoint of sociology but would
hardly be the kind of literature their
students should spend time upon
but there is no literature anywhere
to be called by that name that is
imqyrobable except of course fairy

tales fables et cetera so i do not
like improbable tales in your pages
-much less impossible stories so if
you print improbabilities all my ar-
guments are taken away

  we want to thank mr gage for
his frank opinion and we consider
this reaction far from finding fault
as he puts it we are always appre-
ciative of our readers reactions to
the stories we publish after all we
want all of our members of the
roundup to feel free at any time to
raise their voices whether it be in
praise or censure we welcome these
letters which reflect the type of en-
tertainment you prefer and natu-
rally it is to our interest to provide

gunfire rides the drag

  mike mcbride was twenty-one
this second day of the beef drive
when the black clouds hung low
from big baldy to the screw jack
hills far south and now and then
the clouds dropped marching veils
of mist and fine rain into which the
big circle  steers plodded with
lowered heads

  twenty-one this day-and under
a down-pulled black hat and gay
close-woven blanket poncho mike

mcbride was singing as he spurred
the chunky claybank ahead toward
larrupin ed shaw who was riding
point

  you could feel like singing on a
day like this you didnt care
whether it was sleeting or snowing


street  smiths western story

raining or sunny when youd come
twenty-one and half of a beef drive
was your birthday present

  half of six hundred and twenty-
eight head by the final tally as they
strung off the home ground for the
leisurely two weeks drive to the
two rivers shipping pens prime
steers for the most part with a few
old mossy bulls and cows that had
been hazed out of the salt creek
breaks

  concho walker had promised it
three days ago before riding to
salt fork with the wagon and old
jump-john myers

 youre plenty man already
mike but itll be legallike afore
jump-john an i meet the drive at
dripping springs with the wagon
conchos gnarled hand had
reached for tobacco and brown pa-
pers as he growled dont seem
no time since you was that tough
hungry little button that the bliz-
zard blowed in to help me v jump-
john save them cattle

  mike had grinned reminiscently
as he stood wiry and lean gray eyes
level with old conchos faded stare

  seems to me like it was a long
time ago mike had said a heap
has happened since

  concho twisted the end of his
smoke deliberately and lighted it be-
fore he spoke

  uh-huh a heap you was just
shadin twelve i want but a
busted-down old brusher squatter
with a measly beef bunch that
want even paid for salt fork was
half a dozen shacks an free grass
laid from the baldy range to the
screwjack malpais

  i mustve brought the rush
mike chuckled look at salt fork
now-six saloons a bank a sheriff
an a boothill every time i ride
out i hear someone else has come
into the country

  conchos seamed old face had
darkened at things he hated

  gittin so a man caint roll out
o his soogans an stretch without
pokin some stranger in the eye
good thing i got here first an took
my pick

 then concho had shrugged
weve done all right i reckon
the circle  has got grass an wa-
ter an the beef drive this yearll
bring us good cash money to bank
weve worked hard an et old jerky
an bad beans long enough the
hard days is done were in the tall
grass an clover an youve moren
done yore share mike all them
lean years without wages same as
jump-john an me so im gonna
start you out a man with half the
steer money in the two rivers
bank in yore name

  mike had flared back quickly
who wants any cash money in
the bank you think ive been
hangin around for a big hunk of the
fat meat

  shut up concho had snapped
i know what im a-doin an like
i told you-all this mornin im leav-
ing you men to get the drive under
way while i ride to salt fork with
jump-john an the wagon well
meet you at the springs

  the way you cussed salt fork
last time you come back mike had
observed i wouldnt figure youd
hone to see it before two rivers
dont care if i never see it
again concho had growled just
lookin at the place gets me feelin
crowdy but i got business to do
an i might as well get it over with
maybe you an mell ride on from
two rivers after the steers is sold
its time a younger feller like you
shoved cash money in his pocket an
looked around you been workin
too hard on the circle  fer years
now
death takes a tally



  i been gettin out last year i
rode to el paso an santa fe

  i aint askin where you been
concho had snapped im tellin
you what youll probly do you
aint big enough yet to stand an
argy with me i told you-an
thats how itll be dem that lead
in my shoulder its gonna rain

well that was old concho
a-snorting and a-bellowing like
a tailed-up bull for fear someone
would find how soft he was inside
but mike mcbride knew even
now as he spurred his claybank
through a spit of rain mikes throat
tightened at the thought of that
birthday present

  many a man worked hard all his
life and never laid hands on so much
money it was wealth for a young
buster just twenty-one and hard
to believe even now mike hadnt
expected it

  years back when that hard-
shelled button wearing too-big hand-
me-downs had ridden out of the
storm on a stolen horse the circle 
sod cabin and the gaunt stooped old
brush buster had meant only
warmth and grub for a few days un-
til the weather faired helping hold
the sorry bunch of cows from a dis-
astrous drift had been no more than
even trade for grub but the few
days had stretched into weeks
months years the button and the
circle  had grown together

  old concho walker had been one
of quantrells riders and before and
after that a freighter gambler cow-
hand handy with a gun from the
mexican settlements in california to
the rip-roaring spot on cherry
creek that had turned into the sil-
ver-and-cattle town called denver
concho had come out of it all an
old man with empty pockets and
lead scattered in his tall gaunt frame

to ache when the weather was bad

  but land and cattle of his own
had done something to the old man
winter evenings when concho told
yarns of the past he talked calmly
as a man might speak of things some
other man had lived through

  but when he talked of the cir-
cle  conchos faded squinty eyes
glowed and his voice grew eager

  i had to live to be an old fool
afore i dropped my loop on a good
thing button a man aint a man
until his feet stand hard on his own
land the circle  aint much now
but shes a-gettin bigger each year
like you button aint no tellin
what a young un or a good cow
spreadll grow into if theyre han-
dled right jest keep yore eye peeled
an watch

  staying around to watch the cir-
cle  grow had seemed natural to
mike mcbride before a fellow
knew it the circle  was home the
circle s good luck and bad luck
were part of life

  you sort of forgot that all men
werent square and generous like old
concho that life was wolf eat wolf
that when you grew up you were
going to outwolf them all because
of tnose early years when youd
been kicked around by bigger
wolves

  times you did think about it you
were confident youd outwolf them
all when old concho didnt need you
any more and you finally left the
circle  youd grown to handle
guns in a way that made even
concho grunt with approval your
half-starved kid body had grown
fast to stocky tireless manhood

concho didnt know about that
saloon trouble in el paso last
fall that would have ended in gun
trouble if mike mcbrides fists
hadnt beaten a border tough help-


street  smiths western story

less and then the toughs partner
reeling and dazed before either man
could snatch his gun

  concho and old jump-john and
the newer hands larrupin ed
shaw slim chance gus delight
jim crowder and sam parks never
suspected the cold wolfish delight
that flooded mike mcbride when he
thought of that savage saloon fight
that had left him cock of the walk
and ready for more trouble-gun
trouble if anyone asked for it

  the wolf pup had become a he-
wolf ready for the pack but now
as mike stopped singing and stared
into the misty rain throat tight at
the thought of those steers that were
his birthday present he felt less like
a he-wolf than at any time he could
remember

  concho had given more than
prime steers more than money in
the bank or friendship and hearty
words a part of the old man had
reached out to something in mike
mcbride that had been frozen
aloof coldly vengeful ever since as
a terrified kid just coming eight he
had seen his mother butchered by
renegades mavsquerading as raiding
kiowas

  as mike rode up larrupin ed
shaw observed

  you shore pick purty weather to
bust out singin like a canary bet-
ter save it pr yore night trick in
case we git thunder an lightning
them old mossybacks is still mad
an boogery an layin off to lead a
run

  ive got plenty left over mike
chuckled aint you heard this is
a birthday

  larrupin ed hunched under his
yellow slicker wet hat brim droop-
ing and water trickling off his long
mustache as he grumbled

  when you git old as i am youll

groan on yore birthdays kid
concho knowed what he was about
when he went around by salt fork
with the wagon bet hes bellied
up to a dry bar now swappin lies
over a whiskey bottle

  concho aint had a drink in
years mike reminded

  larrupin ed shifted in the saddle
and snorted

  aint because he didnt want it
conchos been takin his likker kick
in buildin up his cow spread an
gettin drier every year like a desert
weed in a drought when it comes
time for rain conchos dry roots is
gonna soak up everything in sight
larrupin ed shook water off his
mustache and chuckled grimly

  ive seen em dry out like that
before an when they finally git
set under a gentle pour o whiskey
they sprout flowers an green leaves
an howl i hear concho talkin
about the hard days bein over if
that aint medicine talk to break a
drought i never heered none and
i kin spot a sly look in that old
coons eye he had somethin on his
mind when he lit out fer salt fork
it werent grub fer us or dodgin a
wet saddle out here with the drive
either

  its your own tongue thats
hangin dry mike grinned salt
fork aint the place concholl go to
do his drinkin he aint liked salt
fork since it growed up fast so close
under his nose if he was in two
rivers now with the steers sold
you might be guessin right con-
chos earned a case of likker the
way hes worked an done without
whyd he have to go to salt
fork then

  had business there maybe at
the new courthouse

  have it yore way larrupin ed
shrugged well know when we meet
death takes a tally

is

the wagon at drippin springs to-
morrow night- say didja hear
that

  two faint gunshots had come sog-
gily through the mist veils hiding
the brushy country through which
the drive had just come

  sounded like a signal mike
said twisting in the saddle and star-
ing back

ing swing were looking back also

  several moments passed and then
two more shots rapped unmistak-
ably far back of where slim chance
was bringing up the drag

  trouble larrupin ed jerked
out an a little more of that
shootin close inll send them mossy-
horns hightailin better git back
an see whats wrong

  mike was already reining hard
back past the noisy nervous cattle
past gus delight who was riding
fast to head off an old cow and try-
ing to look back toward the gun-
shots at the same time back past
the drags that had started to fan
out from the gunfire behind them

  slim chance wasnt at his post
keeping them bunched and moving
ahead slim might have been shot
off his horse

  but the horse wasnt in sight ei-
ther as two more shots cracked
sharply mike galloped all of two
hundred yards on the back trail be-
fore he made out slims riderless
black pony beyond a chaparral
clump

  swearing mike had his belt gun
out from under the blanket poncho
before he saw slim getting to his
feet on the other side of the horse
beyond the chaparral clump a sec-
ond horse was easily recognizable as
conchos pet gray star then mike
saw that a man was visible lying at
slims feet

chapter n
bushwhackers reward

mike swore again as he raced
close enough to note the
stricken worry on slims angular
face concho hurt out here miles
from dripping springs where he
was to have met the drive

  mike brought the running horse
up short and hit the muddy ground
before he saw that the prone man
was old jump-john myers

  plugged in the lungs an hip
slim said hoarsely look at him
it was there plain enough to see
old jump-john white-haired bow-
legged stooped he was older than
concho and not good for much any
more but droll humor and driving a
wagon and helping cook old jump-
john with his slicker muddy and
blood-smeared and the crimson
froth of his life bubbling on a slack
mouth as the misty rain patted un-
noticed on his wide staring eyes

  he mustve cut our sign bade
there a piece an burred on his horse
until he sighted the drag slim said
huskily guess he couldnt make it
any more an dragged his gun an
shot as he took a header off the
hoss hes been tryin to tell me
something about concho but he
chokes up an cant get it out
jump-john was choking again as
mike knelt in the mud rattling
gasps shook the frail hunched fig-
ure strangling on his own weak-
ness and blood jump-john was and
not much could be done about it
there wasnt any way to get a doc-
tor and probably not even enough
time to call back the grub wagon
that was far ahead with the remuda
and give the dying man shelter

  mike lifted the old mans head a
little it helped jump-john got
his throat clear drew a sobbing
breath and gathered his strength


street  smiths western story

with visible effort his harsh whis-
per was clear enough

  git to salt fork an stop con-
cho he done a little business an
took a drink an was off like a wild
man celebratin about his son he
was whoopin fer the whole damn
town to drink to the feller whos a
big cattleman

  slim bending over the spot heard
him and whistled

  concho never mentioned no son
always acted like hed never been
married

  i told him so an he called me
a ole fool an yelled fer me to drink
to the boy jump-john gasped
conchos throwed his loop on a
hellacious drunk thats gotta be
stopped

  he have a gun fight before you
left mike demanded

  jump-john rolled his head weakly
in a negative

  i seen he was set to stay in salt
fork an likely drink er gamble the
circle  away so i got his hoss out
o the livery stable an started to
head you boys off an git someone
to stop him afore the tinhorn gam-
blers got at him an just this side
of the salt fork crossin by the
black butte i was bushwhacked
feller plugged me twicet with a rifle
an then rode up to make sure i was
a goner

jump-john choked and gasped
again and when the spasm
passed he was vastly weaker mike
had to bend low to hear now

  never seen the feller before
look near big pine he shouldve
   kept away

 whyd he shoot you mike
asked can you hear me john
whyd he shoot you

  jump-john heard for his head
moved in another negative but his
gasping whisper was not the reply

  git concho afore its too late
im afeered-

 jump-john choked again and
mikes eyes were smarting and he
was swearing in husky helplessness
as he watched the old man go quiet
and inert in the circle of his arm

  larrupin ed came riding up as
mike lowered his burden to the wet
yellow slicker and stood up

  i heered more shots what the
devil is it larrupin ed yelled as
he rode up

 jump-john was bushwhacked
theres trouble in salt fork circle
the cattle an get the wagon back
here for a burying mike threw
harshly at the older man im rid-
in to salt fork

  but larrupin ed was already
swinging down

 bushwhacked who bush-
whacked him

  he didnt get it out

  larrupin eds long black mus-
tache jerked as he looked down at
jump-john and began to swear bit-
terly

  how come someone shot a harm-
less old feller like him wheres the
wagon wheres concho aint
that his horse

 conchos in salt fork on a
drunk mike said hoarsely some-
thing to do with a son he never told
us about jump-john figgered hed
better get word to us an started on
conchos horse he was bush-
whacked this side of the salt fork
crossing thats all we got from
him jump-john never carried
money enough to earn a killing an
never made trouble

  on conchos hoss it might be he
was mistook for concho larrupin
ed suggested

  concho was raising hell in salt
fork mike reminded bitterly
why would anybody be at the salt
fork crossing looking for him
death takes a tally



  it mustve been a mistake slim
put in heavily concho ner jump-
john never riled anyone enough to
bring on a killin this way

  mistake hell mike said vio-
lently you dont make a mistake
down a rifle barrel in daytime not
twice you know damn well who
youre shootin an why jump-
john was killed because he was

with the gun in his back mike gam-
bled everything on one wild chance

jump-john an the reasons back
there in salt fork where conchos
blowed his top over this son thats
turned up you menll have to bury
jump-john im going to salt fork
for the answer

mike was swinging in the saddle
as he finished larrupin ed
plunged over to his stirrup

waitll we get the drive stopped
an the wagon back here an ill side
yuh mike he urged

  stay with the cattle mike told
him better push on to the
springs for the water an grass ill
bring concho to the springs might
as well bury jump-john here he
was like concho always wanted
to be off alone a heap ill get my
rifle and turn the remuda back


street  smiths western story

  before larrupin ed could an-
swer mike was spurring away gus
delight saw him coming and rode
back to meet him

 jump-johns death made gus
erupt in profane anger a signal
caught sam parks attention lar-
rupin ed galloped up mike tar-
ried long enough to help start the
big steers circling and then went on
to get his rifle and turn back the
wagon and remuda

jump-john had died late in the
afternoon dark had just closed
down the rain had stopped and
patches of moonlight were gleaming
through holes in the clouds when the
black butte loomed off to mikes
right with cloud streamers drifting
past the top like strands of misty
hair

  jump-john had said to look near
a big pine many pines grew near
black butte and more than one big
pine stood near the trail the soggy
ground was dark and there was lit-
tle chance to find what jump-john
had been talking about

  mike turned off the trail to sev-
eral of the big pines without much
hope of seeing anything it was as
good a way as any to spell his horse
and it was the horse snorting shy-
ing from something on the ground
that located the body mike would
have missed

  a flaring match showed the man
lying face down on the wet pine nee-
dles black hat half crushed under
his head mike rolled him over
another match made clear the thin
foxlike fa-ce with a loose mouth un-
der a neat brown mustache

 a two-gun man one gun was
still in the hand-stamped leather
holster the other lay beside the
body a bullet had struck beside
the left nostril and come out the
back of the head

 this was what jump-john had
tried to tell about what jump-john
had meant when he said the stranger
should have kept away

  mike stood there in the black
night picturing old jump-john gal-
loping hard from the salt fork
crossing while this fox-faced gunman
carefully sighted a rifle and fired the
death bullet

  old john must have tried to reach
cover the second shot perhaps
had knocked him out of the saddle
under the pine like a dead man
old john must have lain here while
the stranger came up to make sure
the job was done right then old
john had nailed him square in the
face

  old-timers like jump-john and
concho were rawhide tough jump-
john had been tough enough to get
back on his horse and ride on to find
the circle  drive

  the dead man mike discovered
wore a money belt that held several
hundred dollars in gold and a
deputy sheriffs badge mike was
frowning as he put the badge back
and shoved the money belt in one
of the saddle pockets if the dead
man was a deputy why wasnt he
wearing his badge if he wasnt a
deputy why was he carrying the
badge in his money belt

  answers to those questions were
no clearer than old jump-johns
murder the dead mans horse was
gone wandered away probably
carrying the rifle that had killed
jump-john

  mike was turning back for a final
look at the body when his elaybank
nickered loudly and over to the
left back in the trees another horse
nickered

  at the first sound mike snatched
his belt gun and jumped for the
trailing reins then he listened it
might be the dead mans horse still
death takes a tally



tied where the owner had left him
before ambushing jump-john

  the horses nickered again and
wind shook drops from the trees in
ghostly pattering then silence fell
again the clouds parted and let
silver moonlight drench the spot as
mike moved to mount and ride to
the other horse

  a sharp high voice behind the big
pine froze his movement youre
covered with a rifle stand still

chapter iii

challenged

under his breath mike damned
the bright moonlight that made
him a clear target to rifle shots only
a few feet away his back was to
the gun too

  nerves on his neck prickled
crawled as he thought how he had
stood there striking matches with a
gun covering him all the time he
could have been shot down easier
than jump-john

  all right mike said without
looking around now what

  drop the reins step back with
your hands in the air

  mike took two steps back grin-
ning mirthlessly it had been hard
to believe his ears but now there
was no doubt that a woman held the
gun on him

  drop your gun she ordered
her voice was thin tight unsteady
clear though any other time it
might have been a pretty voice

  sposin i dont mike said lis-
tening for sign of a man but if
there were a man he would have
done the talking

  i dont want to shoot you like a
dog she sounded close to tears
as if nerves were ragged and tight
and her unsteady finger might press
the trigger any instant and she
added shooting is too good for

you theyll know how to settle
you in salt fork

here goes the gun mike said
the moonlight still flooded on
him the soft thud of the gun on
the mat of pine needles was audible
now step back away from it
mike stepped back without try-
ing to look around

  mind telling me maam how
come youre out here by black
butte this time of evening it aint
a place for a woman

  if i hadnt met his horse head-
ing back home and followed up the
back trail i wouldnt have caught
you robbing his body the rope
theyll put around your neck will be
too good for you

  she must have been standing just
beyond the pine trunk all the time
hed been examining the body mike
thought not half a dozen steps
away one easy shot would have
finished him-and shed been in the
mind to do it

  lady mike said over his shoul-
der i dont rob dead men aint
you a little hasty about a rope
around my neck

  the damp pine needles were noise-
less under her movements the rifle
muzzle was prodding mikes back
before he knew she had come out
from behind the pine her voice
was bitter scornful

  you sneaking thief i saw you
take his money belt and you knew
where he was i saw you come
along the trail looking for him one
of your friends must have shot him
and you came back to rob him
mike whistled softly so thats
how you got it figgered he your
husband

  i havent any husband hes my
brother she jabbed fiercely with
the rifle you hear me my
brother shootings too good for


street  smiths western story

you hangings too good for a mis-
erable thief like you

  sister huh mike said and his
voice hardened as he thought of old
jump-john i mightve known
bushwhackings more in the family
line aint it

  what do you mean somehow
a little of the anger was gone as she
put the question

  you ought to know if youve
growed up a sister to him mike
said harshly dont tell me you
dont know he was a skunk a man
dont get his age an turn bush-
whacker in a day hes killed his
men and run a dirty trail before an
the family must have known it he
got what was coming to him-an if
theres any more like him in the
family theyll probably end up the
same way get that gun out of my
back i dont hurt women

the rifle muzzle stayed hard in
his back but her voice
changed to huskiness to something
close to fright who are you
what are you talking about

  im mike mcbride from the
circle  i rode here from our beef
drive to two rivers one of our
men was coming from salt fork to
meet us when your brother bush-
whacked him here old jump-john
killed him an managed to find us
an tell us before he died i wasnt
robbing the body i took the money
belt to give to the salt fork sheriff
your brother asked for what he got
killing me wont help the circle 
men know about it

  so thats what happened
thats what happened mike
said harshly

  i  i believe you
thanks mike said ironically
over his shoulder

  d-dont take that belt to the
sheriff she pleaded

  ill take it if i can get there
lady mike promised grimly

  stand still dont try to f-follow
me she gulped she was crying
in soft racking sobs that she seemed
to be trying to conceal

 despite the grim memory of
jump-john mikes anger vanished
this woman sounded young and
suddenly helpless in grief and hurt
the gun left his back and she was
gone

  mike swung around and glimpsed
her running out of the moonlight
into the dark shadows beyond the
pine back toward the horse that
had nickered she stumbled slightly
as her foot slipped and kept on a
slim small figure with both hands
still clutching the rifle

  the whispering sound of her sobs
came back for a moment and then
she was indistinct and vanishing in
the night shadows

  a dead stick cracked her horse
nickered again and then the stamp
of hoofs the crackling of branches
marked her spurring retreat on the
horse

  mike stood there alone with the
dead man he could have followed
her-and perhaps been shot at a
woman in her state might do any-
thing

  helpless and crying trying only
to get away from him as if he
were guilty of her hurt he didnt
know who she was but he was sure
now that she hadnt realized the
dead man was a killer and shed
believed mike mcbrides angry
words without question believed
and fled

  didnt even give me an argu-
ment mike muttered scowling
down at the dead man

  but the dead couldnt hear or an-
swer back and the girl was gone it
would be hard and maybe dangerous
to try to catch her
death takes a tally



  she must live this side of salt
fork it wouldnt be hard now to
find out who the dead man was
and meanwhile concho walker was
in salt fork maybe in trouble

  mike left the dead man there un-
der the big pine and started on to-
ward salt fork and the bleak
cold anger at jump-johns killer was
grimmer now and he couldnt get
his mind off that sobbing fleeing
girl

chapter iv

salt fork celebrates

salt fork was a raw new town
that had mushroomed at the
fork of salt creek and blue river
when years ago old concho had
brought his mortgaged cattle onto
the lush grass north of the screw-
jack hills salt fork had been only
a few shanties and a trading post

 when the button named mike
mcbride had thrown in with the
circle  the last indian outbreak
had just been cleaned up to the
west gold had been discovered in
the cohita mountains a hundred
and fifty miles farther west and the
easiest way for the freight was
through salt fork with the indi-
ans out of the way cattle were safe
in the screwjack country and the
settlers had come fast

  salt fork had grown as fast and
been made the seat of a new coun-
try and on his circle  land con-
cho had grumbled about the rush of
strangers that put neighbors within
ten or fifteen miles and made salt
fork a bare fifty miles away a raw
wide-open cattle town almost under
their noses

  it was an hours fast ride from the
black butte to salt fork the clay-
bank was foam-flecked and blowing
hard when mike dismounted before
the colorado house the two-story

 ws-e

adobe hotel where the stages
stopped

  wagons and horses were at the
hitch racks along the muddy street
windows were lighted indicating
that salt fork was wide awake
mike walked stiffly into the hotel
and spoke to a fat gloomy-looking
clerk who was seated on a high stool
behind the counter making entries
in a ledger

  where can i find a gent by the
name of concho walker mike de-
manded

  the fat man started and spilled
a drop of ink on the sheet as he
looked up and blinked you mean
the old man who owns the circle 
thats him is he around
hes been around the fat man
said sourly his pen tip indicated
the long rafters behind mike peel
your eye up there bub an youll
see where he shot hell out o the ceil-
ing this afternoon said he was
goin to write his sons name up
there so salt forkd never forget it
he like to shot the shirt tail off a
preacher that had the room up
there

  i aint bub and the preacher
can look after his own shirt tail
mike said coldly whats the
sons name

  walker i reckon thats the
old uns name

  he have the son with him
  not as i seen

  wheres walker now

  the devil only knows the fat
man said sourly i only hope he
stays away until he sobers up

several men sitting in chairs
had listened to the conversation
one of them said he was at the
gold rush a couple of hours ago
going strong drinks is free an he
swears hell have the whole town
drunk tonight


street  smiths western story

  why dont the sheriff lock him
up mike demanded harshly

  if ban shelton locked up every-
one that bought drinks fer the
town the fat clerk grumbled salt
forkd be a hell of a place shel-
tons got the right idea he lets
em have a good time

  specially when they howdy-do as
how theyll pin a few ears back with
a stud deck as soon as they square
off at a table with any gents whod
like to learn poker from an expert
the other man drawled shelton
aint the man to annoy his gambler
friends by lockin the sucker up is
he

  a queer look came over the clerks
fat face

  that aint no way to be talkin
shelton wouldnt like it

  ill bet not the speaker agreed
in his lazy drawl

  he was a clean-shaven middle-
aged man in a black suit gray hat
and expensive half boots his air
of prosperity suggested that he came
from one of the larger towns long
slim hands unmarked by hard work
hinted that he might be a gambler
but his lip had curled with disdain
when he spoke of the sheriffs gam-
bler friends

  the clerk cleared his throat
frowned and started to say some-
thing then he pressed his lips to-
gether dipped the pen into the ink
and hunched back over his ledger

  thanks mike said and hurried
out

  at least concho hadnt gotten
himself into a gun fight but old
jump-john had been right concho
was on a hellacious drunk that
might lose him the circle  and ev-
erything he had built up in the lean
hard years of his old age

  larrupin ed had called the turn

too concho had dried out too long
and now the old man was roaring
wild on whiskey at the mercy of
any crooked gambler who might be
friendly with the sheriff mike was
scowling as he looked in a saloon
saw no customers and crossed the
muddy street toward another saloon

  ban shelton salt forks sheriff
had been in office less than a year
mike had seen him only once from
across the street a tall stringy man
with a reddish mustache a fancy
pearl-handled revolver and a big
fancy white sombrero

  shelton was a texas man he
was said to be handy with a gun
and was backed by all the texicans
who had settled in the south part
of the county

  the second saloon had only one
customer and he was not concho
mike studied the hitch racks and
building fronts along the street for
signs of the most life and ended up
at a low adobe building that housed
the stag saloon

the stag hitch rack was crowded
with horses loud voices laugh-
ter fiddle and piano music were au-
dible inside and as mike walked
in a high-pitched rebel yell keened
over the other sounds

  a burst of laughter followed the
tall gaunt bearded man in a bat-
tered black hat and worn buckskin
who had given the yell sighted mike
and took a step toward him whoop-
ing  nother stranger an walk-
in steady an sober er my name aint
jubal lark whatll it be young
feller yuh caint stay the only so-
ber un in town

  mike grinned as he allowed him-
self to be urged to the bar

  whiskey mike said i hear
concho walkers gettin the town
drunk
death takes a tally

  jubal lark whooped again

  concho walker theres a man
wholl do fer ary partner knowed
him on the picketwire thirty year
ago i did an they want ary cur-
rycomb made fer him then were

keepin er pourin while concho
gits him some rest with a leetle
poker barkeep everybodys
drink in i got the dust tuh pay fer
it golds gold in ary place yuh see
hit an i got the gold

  his rebel yell split the noise
again

  drink up on jubal lark an con-
cho walker hits free an hits here
a-waitin

  whoops and yells marked the
rush to the already crowded bar
the crowd was good-naturedly noisy
and drunk

  it must have been going on for
hours mike had never seen any-
thing like it concho had likkered
up most of salt fork half a dozen
men already were lying helplessly
against the walls where they had
been dragged

  whered you say concho was
mike asked jubal lark

  in the back havin him a few
cyards yuh know concho young
feller

  mike nodded

  jubal lark dropped an arm on
his shoulder and grabbed for his
hand

  im proud to know yuh son
conchos friends is jubal larks
friends git outside that drink an
ill take you to concho hes
a-waitin fer you boy conchos
a-waitin fer all his friends well
tote him a bottle an bring him luck
with them cyards

  the drink helped after the wet
day and hard ride but mike was

hard-eyed and watchful as he edged
away from the bar after jubal lark

chapter v

sheriff on guard

the saloon was l-shaped with
the bar in front and the side of
the l a long beamed room holding
a dance floor and tables jubal
lark weaved toward a door in a par-
tition at the back

  a man drinking beer at a table
near the door stood up when mike
and jubal lark approached the
big white sombrero topping the tall
stringy figure was familiar before
mike recognized ban shelton the
sheriff

  shelton hitched his gun belt up as
he stepped over before the door

  where you men headin he de-
manded	
bringin luck an a friend to my
ole pard concho jubal lark
whooped step in with us sher-
iff an clean out yore guzzle with

  ban sheltons angular face red-
dened

  lippy young squirt aint you
whon hell are you

  mcbrides the name i work for
the circle  brand i rode here to

mike was almost clear
of salt fork when
guns opened up across
the street and the
claybank went down
death takes a tally



see concho walker and  aim to
see him anything in your law book
that says i cant see him

ban sheltons eyes were set
close and mean-looking when
you watched them narrowing and
flaming in dislike as they did now

  my law book says youre too
damn smart for your age he said
harshly its got six pages a han-
dle an a steel barrel an ill bend
it over that swelled young head if
you dont get back to the bar with
this man an stop disturbin the
peace thats final warnin

  mike was grinning hed grinned
like this before and felt like this in-
side when the wild fracas had
started in the el paso saloon it
was a hot and surging feeling inside
like fire suddenly roaring up against
trouble

  workin with the tinhorn gam-
blers are you he said still grin-
ning get them hands up turn
around open that door

  ban sheltons look had turned
venomous as the first words came
out his hand had slapped down
toward the fancy pearl-handled
gun but it stopped when he saw
the fast outflip of mikes old
wooden-handled 

  the sheriffs jaw stayed loose in
amazement as mike bit out the or-
ders with the same cold grin slowly
shelton turned and reached for the
doorknob mike jerked the pearl-
handled six-gun from the holster

  jubal lark had sobered into quick
uneasiness

  wait a minute young feller he
protested they aint no use slick-
in up the sheriff trouble aint
conchos idee today

  pick out a spot of floor an guz-
zle yourself blind mike said
through his teeth im handlin
this you sheriff hurry up lemme

see concho walker im in a
hurry

  therell be hell to pay for this
ban shelton threatened thickly as
he stepped through the doorway
into a dim passage beyond

  ask for it and youll get it
mike said open up that card
game an show me concho

  the edges of the second door on
the right oozed light and murmur-
ing voices then the bright-yellow
lamp light glowed into the passage
and the voices went silent as shel-
ton opened the door and stood there
with his hands up

  what the hell a nasal voice ex-
claimed

past the sheriffs shoulder mike
saw a bottle glasses and cards
on a table under a hanging brass
lamp that was wreathed in bluish
tobacco smoke

  a stud game by the lay of the
cards four players concho had
his back to the door the nasal-
voiced man was across the table
facing the door under the down-
pulled brim of his hat a lean fur-
rowed face eyed the sheriff fixedly

  on the right side of the table a
burly red-faced man with his vest
open and his sleeves rolled up on
big hairy arms had been dealing
cards he put the deck down slowly
as his lread turned on a thick pow-
erful neck under bushy black
brows his eyes narrowed at the
doorway

  the fourth man on the left side
of the table was small lean and
young behind a scanty blond mus-
tache his rather handsome face was
suddenly nervous as he leaned for-
ward and saw the sheriff a stack
of chips clattered softly as he
dropped them on the table he slid
lower in the chair as if shrinking
from trouble
street  smiths western story

  get up concho mike said
sharply ive come for you

  eh conchos voice was thick
his chair scraped back and he stag-
gered as he started to get up who
is it

  a damn stranger lookin for trou-
ble on account of the old man
shelton said harshly he drawed a
gun on me

  shut up mike said concho
come out o there

  concho caught at the chair to
steady himself and lurched around
into the doorway peering to see what
was happening his stooped spare
frame hid the rest of the room for
the moment and back of concho
there was no warning as a gunshot
blasted out the overhead light

  mike couldnt shoot the sheriff in
the back but any tenderfoot would
have recognized this as a mess of
trouble for mike mcbride and con-
cho walker

  damn your dirty tricks mike
swore as he jerked up the  to pis-
tol-whip the sheriff out of the way

  the blow glanced ff a shoulder
shelton had nimbly dodged aside in
the sudden dark as the pressure of
the gun left his back

  duck concho mike yelled a
second blasting shot in the card room
drowned the words then there was
a third shot

  a man lurched out of the doorway
into mike and would have fallen if
mike hadnt thrown out a support-
ing arm it was concho reeking of
whiskey and now worse than drunk

  mike jumped back with conchos
sagging weight full on his arm he
fired past concho at a gun flash in-
side the card-room doorway

  concho was muttering something
but the words were lost as other
guns hammered a hail of lead out
the card-room doorway bullets
that would have riddled them both

if mike hadnt moved fast

  there was no time now to hear
what concho was saying concho
was badly hit hed be killed and
mike mcbride too if those poker
sharks had their way

chapter vi

gun-smoke inheritance

mike bumped into jubal lark
as he backed with conchos
stumbling weight he was throwing
shots past concho at the doorway
where red gun flashes searched after
them the sheriff had disappeared
back in the dark hallway

  get outta the way mike yelled
crowding back past jubal lark with
his burden

  the numbing slam of a bullet fur-
rowed his left arm the arm that was
holding up concho maybe it
meant another wound for concho
the old man had been hit more than
once his weight was getting
heavier

  mike was raging with wild anger
this was like the killing of old
jump-john this was cold murder
a second time without any excuse
or reason that a man could see
murder backed by ban shelton the
sheriff

 honcho was stumbling badly
ready to fall there wasnt a chance
to duck for cover and make a stand
mikes shoulder hit the side of the
doorway he staggered back out of
the passage found the open door
with a sweep of his arm and
slammed it shut

  beside him jubal lark grumbled
whyd yuh have to start trouble
thataway young un whats the
matter with concho

  conchos knees buckled and a
great groaji wrenched from him

cant make it any more mike
death takes a tally



he gasped lempie down an run
fer it

  here outside the passage there
was dim light from the front of the
saloon light that showed conchos
weathered wrinkled face contorted
with pain

  blood was spreading over con-
chos shoulder a great red blotch
was widening on the front of his
shirt mike swallowed a groan as
he saw that a bullet had gone in
conchos back and torn out big in
the front concho didnt have a
chance

  concho knew it his look had
cleared and steadied concho was
a sober man now calling on the last
of his strength as he tried to push
mike away

  jubal concho gasped

  here pardner

  help the boy git away hes my
boy my son dont let em git
him

  hells blazes wliynt somebody
say so jubal lark blurted he
never told me shore ill watch
him

  jubal lark whirled menacingly
toward the crowd that was cau-
tiously moving out from the bar
into the other end of the l-shaped
room

  git back there jubal lark
yelled keep out o this ill plug
the first snake that gits in our way

concho was sitting on the floor
now supporting himself with a
hand as mike finished reloading the
 and cocked the sheriffs fancy re-
volver in the other hand

  wheres your real son mike
asked huskily ill get to him if i
can an tell him

  always wanted a son concho
wrenched out been aimin fer it

i come here to salt fork this trip

an made it legal lawyer sanders
drawed up the papers so youll git
the circle  an all i own  took
me a drink to celebrate-an
couldnt stop the celebratin

  concho gulped and smiled faintly
aint every day a old hardshell like
me gits a bang-up son hes so proud
about

  mikes throat was suddenly tight
so that it was hard to speak his
eyes were moistening strangely as
he knelt there on the rough floor
with cocked six-guns and looked at
conchos lean wrinkled face and
bowed shoulders

  conchos faded frosty eyes were
clouding now and yet they were
bright too with a pride and satis-
faction mike had never before seen

  you neednt have done it mike
gulped youve been betterll a
father

  might a whaled you a few times
wlten i didnt concho said thickly
and managed to smile as he bowed
there with a hand over the torn hole
in his stomach and blood creeping
out over the gnarled fingers

  a spasm passed over conchos
face he fought it away and
gasped

  listen while i cn talk its the
only chance ill get to talk to a real
son youve growed up now i
want you tuh keep growin dont
wait like me till yore busted down
an wore out afore you git yore roots

street  smiths western story

son

  jubal lark was stamping back
and forth beside them warning the
saloon crowd away the sheriff and
gamblers hadnt appeared they
might any second conchos eyes
were clouding fast mike didnt
know where he was getting the
strength to hold himself up and pour
out the dry feverish words

  kneeling there with the two s
cocked and ready for the gun fight
that might resume any second mike
nodded again unashamed tears in
his eyes

  im listening concho i wont
forget

  yore young enough to make it
concho said itll mean your heart
an yore headll have to keep growin
with yore bank account jealous
menll try to cut you down sofne

cross yuh youll have to be hard

stay hard on the ground while yore
lookin up above where youre climb-
in an when you get there son
i want you to be proud an big with
no shame behind you savvy

  i savvy concho-all of it

  concho was looking at him but
the faded eyes had a faraway look
as if concho already were leaving
and straining back for a last look

  conchos voice was fading away
too

  no matter where you bury me
son ill be lookin when you git up
there to the top ill be proud i
pointed you right-proud of ol
concho walkers son-

  concho mike caught the col-
lapsing figure and eased it to the
floor

  concho was gasping his eyes
had closed he was past hearing
now past caring what happened to
concho walker he had gone far
on that trail all men travel alone
and was going faster farther each
moment

  hes dying mike gulped

  like he wanted to jubal lark
jerked out concho use to say hed
like to git it with his boots on an
guns smokin close aint no more
we cn do boy our skins is next
lets get out o here

mike stood up blinking grip-
ping the two cocked six-guns
there was no time now to think it
all out there at his feet concho
was dying one of the gamblers
had shot concho in the back and
savagely mike knew what had to be
done

  ride your trail mike threw at
jubal lark as he turned toward the
passage door

  what yuh doin

  im gettin the dirty son that
killed concho

  no yuh dont jubal lark said
decisively yore conchos boy i
told him id git yuh out o here
that sheriffll be back to even up
the way yuh handled him

  but mike elbowed past the older
man jerked open the door plunged
into the passage taut and ready to
meet triggered guns

  but the dark passage was quiet
deserted the card room held no
sign of life on to the back mike
ran guns cocked for any movement
ahead then suddenly through an-
other door he came out back of the
building into the open night

  jubal lark was at his heels pro-
testing

  they hightailed to a hole some-
eres yuh wont find em if yuh
hunt all night git out o town
death takes a tally



 boy that sheriffll have help by
 now yuh caint gun-fight him an
 his friends all alone an come out

   in front of the hotel mike mut-
 tered peering about listening

  jubal lark caught his arm and
 spoke with hoarse urgency

 on the drippin springs trail well
 jine yore outfit an talk things over

 gered

   it was only words strung together
 words that had no meaning for mike
 mcbride anger grief at conchos
 death had brought that cold sav-
 age wolfish feeling they wanted
 gun fighting theyd get gun fight-
 ing

   go get your hoss mike said 
 dont worry about me

   jubal lark held onto his arm

   still want trouble dont yuh
 caint ride away an leave hit to an-
 other day you young hotheads is
 all the same listen yore con-
 chos boy yuh made concho a
 dyin promise are yuh gonna keep

   the harsh reminder struck mike
 like cold water it was as though
 concho were standing there in the
 dark with the weight of his gnarled
 hand beside jubal larks hand

   mike wavered surrendered ill
 meet you out on the trail

   good boy keep offn the street
 till yuh get to the hotel an then
 ride like hell that blasted sheriff
 is wantin yuh he aint forgot how
 yuh handled him

jubal lark vanished in the
night startled mike tried to
follow the buckskin-clad mans re-
treat he heard nothing saw noth-
ing jubal lark had gone like a
ghost with a grunt of approval
mike went the other way cutting
back behind the store buildings

  the crowd in the stag saloon was
boiling out into the street the gun-
play the dead man the threat of
more to come had silenced ali but
the noisiest ones

  mike heard a few uncertain yells
as he ran toward the hotel he met
no one back there in the dark behind
the store buildings everything
seemed quiet in front of the hotel
the claybank drooped at the hitch
rail

  but as mike holstered his gun and
stepped out to the rack a quiet
voice said trouble down the street
there

 mike spun toward the voice
then he shoved his six-gun back in
the holster as he recognized the
clean-shaven stranger in the black
suit and expensive boots who had
spoken up in the hotel lobby the
man was leaning against the build-
ing front now smoking a cigarette

  i met the sheriff an his friends
mike said briefly as he turned back
to the claybank and unwrapped the
reins

  figured you might the stranger
drawled without moving who got
hurt

  the man i was looking for
mike answered harshly as he
reached to the saddle murdered
shot in the back might help you
to remember that in the back

 my memory the stranger
drawled is good his cigarette
end was glowing red as mike reined
the claybank out into the street

  back at the stag saloon there
was more noise now as the drunken


street  smiths western story

crowd spread along the street back
there too was concho walker and
a score that mike mcbride would
settle before he again slept easy at
night

  the bitter bite of it was in his
throat as he settled in the saddle to
ride and the drumming crash of
gunshots across the street was the
first warning that he was not getting
out of salt fork without more trou-
ble the next instant the claybank
was screaming rearing high

chapter vii

under arrest

half a dozen guns at least were
spurting fire the claybank
was badly hit high it reared-and
came down loosely pitching forward
into the muddy street

  mike kicked out of the stirrups
threw himself clear of the saddle hit
the ground staggering and sprawled
in the mud the six-gun he had
drawn went deep into the mud
clogging the barrel

  mike hurled the gun away as he
scrambled up and clawed out the
sheriffs gun that was thrust inside
his belt the shots had stopped as
the horse went down now they
started again as mike came up in
the street

  a trip-hammer blow seemed to
tear off the top of his head and he
felt himself falling into blackness
that had no bottom

  then lamplight was in his eyes
and men were about him he was
on his back his shirt off someone
was working on his arm

  the first words he heard sounded
far away his clearing head brought
the voice suddenly just above him
speaking in a mild drawl

  he was lucky an eighth of an
inch lower would have split his skull
like a meat ax this arm wont

bother him much it gouged out a
little muscle and he lost some blood
but hes young and husky enough
to stand it

  hed be better off if hed leaked
all his blood an angry voice broke
in because im gonna hang him
an laugh while the rope stretches
his dirty neck id have killed him
back there in the street if id known
about him then

  hes your prisoner now better
not lose your head the mild voice
advised after all there might be
a mistake

  mistake hell witnesses seen
him shoot old man walker that
money belt in his saddlebag is one
i give my brother he had to kill
jake to get it you try in to tell me
he aint a dirty killer

  im not trying to tell you hes
anything the mild voice said a
jury will do that but dead brother
or not shelton youll do well to
make sure he faces a jury im tell-
ing you now that hell be all right
in a little while i suggest you keep
him that way

  ill ask for your advice when i
want it shelton snapped too
damn many folks tonight are tellin
me how i ought to act as a sheriff
the mild voice said i voted for
you shelton it was my under-
standing salt fork wanted a sheriff
not a judge jury and public execu-
tionist as you see fit youd have
killed this man instead of arresting
him as he lay there in the street if
that stranger hadnt stopped you
a damned lone-wolf gambler
buttin into something that was
none of his business hes anothern
thatll learn to mind his own busi-
ness

  shelton the mild-voiced man
said im a voter a taxpayer and
the only medical man in three days
death takes a tally



mike beard the sheriff com-
ing but he had the lawyer
by the throat before the
sheriff could get to the cell

rr-

ride you might remember that
a sheriff can always be replaced a
doctor cant

the sheriff growled something as
mike opened his eyes the doc-
tor was putting on his black hat
barely past thirty by his looks
clean-shaven with a thin likable
face

  ban shelton was there and an-
other man and behind them were
jail bars mike lifted his head he
was on a cell cot half a dozen men

beyond the bars had been watching
the doctor work

  one of them exclaimed looks
like you was right doc hes a-rear-
in up

  ill handle him ban shelton
grunted his red face was ugly as
he said wheres jakes body
speak up or ill choke it out of
you

  ask your sister mike said with
an effort

  whats judy got to do with it

  she found the body shell tell


street  smiths western story

you i took the money belt to bring
to the sheriff not knowin you
were brother to a man whod bush-
whacked an old man in cold blood
i dont know what in blazes
youre talking about mcbride its
a lie whatever it is judy dont
know jakes dead or shed have sent
word if you brought jakes belt
to the sheriff whyn hell didnt you
give it to me at the stag instead of
pulling a gun when i wasnt looking
and crowdin past to shoot that old
soak youve been workin for
sitting on the cot edge mike was
dizzy sick with the hammering pain
inside his bandaged head the men
outside the bars were watching for
his reply the doctors look was
thoughtful half an eye could see
that even the doctor thought hed
shot concho in the back

  mike tried to stand up protest-
ing thats a lie one of those
gamblers shot concho one of your
friends

  shelton pushed him violently
back on the cot

  that talk aint helpin you
there was witnesses i saw it my-
self well put you before a jury
an let them hang you now every-
body clear out ive got him safe
and ill keep him safe

  just a moment the doctor said
whats this shelton about your
brother killing someone

if this fellers got any kind of a
likely story he can tell it in court
doc mike said looking at the
physician i need a lawyer tell
lawyer sanders to get over here
the sheriff cant keep him out
thats right the young doctor
agreed ill get sanders at once
i dont hold a man from his legal
rights shelton growled all right
men move on

  the sheriff locked the cell door

alone mike hunched on the cot
holding his throbbing head

  concho dead ban sheltons
brother dead he mike mcbride 
charged with both killings the 
money belt pinning one murder on
him shelton and the gamblers
swearing the other murder on him
shelton knew it was a lie knew
who killed concho

  thinking back it was easy to be-
lieve that shelton must have known
concho didnt have a chance and
just now shelton had stopped all
questions about his brother hustled
witnesses out of the way there
was more to this than a card game
and a killing if a man could read
the sign right

  facts were plain concho had
started his roaring drunk old
jump-john had taken conchos
horse and ridden to meet the cir-
cle  drive

  jake shelton the sheriffs brother
had shot jump-john at the black
butte shelton must have followed
jump-john out of salt fork to stop
him and had almost done so al-
most left concho drunk helpless in
the hands of the gamblers and ban
shelton

  they couldnt have planned to
kill concho and lay the murder on
mike mcbride because they hadnt
known mike mcbride was coming

  but while concho was dying ban
shelton had made no attempt to re-
enter the stag saloon and arrest the
men he was now charging with the
killing shelton had gone for
friends had opened fire without
warning as his man was riding away
by the doctors word mike mc-
bride would have been killed there
in the muddy street if a stranger
hadnt stepped in

  all that had happened before ban
shelton had found his brothers
money belt in mike mcbrides sad-
death takes a tally



die bag before shelton knew that
his brother was dead for some rea-
son shelton had wanted mike mc-
bride as quickly dead as concho

  you could bet good gold that
shelton still felt the same way and
not because of his brother and
then you could wonder why

  the girld know mike mut-
tered to himself she said not to
take the belt to the sheriff she
knew damned well her brother jake
got what was cornin to him knew
her sheriff brother was up to some-
thing snaky

chapter viii

double-crossing lawyer

dan shelton stepped back
into the cell alone the fancy
pearl-handled six-gun was in his hol-
ster once more he was scowling as
he spoke through the bars so
jakes dead

  shot by the man he rode out of
town to kill mike said

  youre claiming another man
killed jake

  it was jump-john myers who
rode in here to salt fork with con-
cho maybe you wouldnt be know-
ing that

  wheres this myers now shel-
ton demanded

  like to have a try at shuttin
his mouth wouldnt you go talk
to your sister she found your
brothers body before i did she
heard me say i was bringin the
money belt in to the sheriff
what did judy say

  ask her

  sheltons blustering anger was
under control now his mouth was
tight and hard eyes sharp wary
he stared through the bars as if try-
ing to read the prisoners face a
slow grin twisted his mouth

  you brought judy into this if

youre lucky enough to get into
court shell help hang you

  wouldnt surprise me mike
agreed it must run in the family
someone entered the front office
and shelton turned away

  mike heard voices murmuring for
several moments then shelton
brought in a smiling roly poly little
man in a black frock coat black hat
and red cardboard note case under
an arm

  heres your lawyer shelton
said curtly as he unlocked the cell
door hes a killer sanders and
itll take a better man than you to
get him out

  the lawyer chuckled bringing lit-
tle creases over his smooth pink
cheeks he looked plump jolly
sure of himself

  well let the law settle that
sheriff lock the door and leave us
alone

  you bet ill lock it an dont
take all night im leavin with a
posse to find jakes body i want
you out o here before im gone
according to the law-

  shelton cut him off brusquely
damn the law im running the
jail tonight sanders an im in a
hurry

when they were alone in the
cell mike indicated the other
end of the cot for the lawyer to sit
on and spoke grimly

  shelton seems to be the sheriff
an the law both around sajt fork
talk only talk the pink-
cheeked little man said cheerfully as
he sat down now then young
man can you pay for a good law-
yer

  worried about the money al-
ready

  lawyers have to live sanders
reminded shrewdly
	street  smiths western story

  i reckon i can pay maybe you
didnt get the name im mike mc-
bride

  sanders nodded work for the
circle  i understand

  i reckon i own it now
hm-m-m didnt this concho
walker own the circle 

  concho signed papers making me
his legal son said so in the stag
tonight just before he died he told
me to see you about it

you dont have to worry then
sanders said with returning cheer-
fulness where are the papers
you made em out mike said
where are they

  eh

  concho signed em

  sanders stood up smiling regret-
fully

  walker did say something about
drawing up some papers before he
left town perhaps tomorrow he
didnt sign anything if thats all
the title you have to the ranch
young man you havent anything
the little good-humored crinkles
in the plump smooth face were still
there but mike suddenly realized
that the smile held no friendliness
it was a tricky smile

  youre lying mike charged
concho did sign them papers

  i didnt come here to be called a
liar young man if youre going to
get-

 concho trusted you an you
turned snake soon as he was dead
sanders yelled with fright tried to
dodge in the cramped narrow little
cell as mike came off the cot mike
caught him by the throat slammed
him against the back wall sinking
fingers deep into the puffy neck

  the lawyers face mottled as he
clawed at the corded wrists eyes
began to bulge

  conchos dead but ill get the
truth out o you mike panted

what happened to those papers
whatd you do with them

  then outside the cell ban shel-
ton was shouting whats the mat-
ter here leggo him mcbride
leggo before i gut-shoot yuh
mike yanked the struggling little
lawyer around for a shield

  leads what he needs shoot
the hell out of him

  cursing ban shelton unlocked
the door and plunged in with his
gun mike hurled the half-throttled
little lawyer across the cell at him

  drag the little buzzard out of
here before i break his neck tell
him he aint heard the last of this
if im hung on every gallows from
here to the border i aint the only
friend concho walker had itll
take more than a greasy little law-
yer to work the trick hes trying
shelton pulled the stumbling
choking man outside the cell
slammed the door and locked it

  you get a lawyer an then try
to kill him as soon as my backs
turned itll take a lynching to set-
tle you an the quicker the better
come on sanders i reckon youre
through here

  coughing feeling his neck san-
ders scurried into the sheriffs office
without looking back

breathing heavily mike

dropped back on the cot the
bullet-furrowed arm was hurting
hie head felt worse inside too
for the first time he felt like a
trapped animal he swore thickly
as he rolled a cigarette with un-
steady fingers

  this afternoon hed been mike
mcbride twenty-one owning half
of a prosperous beef drive tonight
for a little while hed been mike
mcbride conchos adopted son
owning all the beef drive and the
circle  too now here in the salt
death takes a tally	

fork jail cell he was mike mc-
bride circle  cowhand pockets al-
most empty and a hang rope staring
him in the face

  mike swore again concho had
signed that paper drunk or sober
concho had told the truth before he
died which made sign that any
man could read

  concho had come to salt fork
left his business with a crooked law-
yer and let whiskey make him a tar-
get for every sharper in town

  theyd worked fast theyd gone
after conchos ranch and cattle
theyd shot concho out of the pic-
ture now they had mike mcbride
locked up and were ready to hang
him theyd have killed him to-
night in front of the hotel if the
stranger hadnt stopped them

  mike paced the cell like a caged
wild cat activity was audible in the
sheriffs office finally it stopped
a lanky man with a drooping mus-
tache and a deputys star pinned on
his vest stepped back to the cell and
peered through the bars

  bans rode out o town an im
in charge yall set for the night
coffeed help my head

  the deputy shifted chewing to-
bacco into the other cheek and
grinned loosely

  this aint a hotel yuhll get
coffee with breakfast if yuh aint
lynched by then uh-huh lynched
heap of folks in these parts thought
well of jake shelton us texans
stays next to one another

 that lawyer sanders from

the deputy grinned again the
ol lone stars a big un

  aint big enough to hold all the
crooks skunks and snakes ive run
into tonight mike said that

goes for you too get out so i can
rest my eyes

  the deputy snarled back through
the bars yuh wont be so damned
talky ifn they get a lynch rope on
yore neck an i aint got no help
to stop em if theyre minded ease
yore damn head with that

  he stamped out mike started
pacing again three steps one way
three the other

  both shelton and his deputy had
spoken about a lynching miss out
on killing a man when you arrested
him and a lynch rope would settle
everything before he walked into
court to tell his side

 mike stopped as something
tapped faintly on the window glass
it was the end of a branch tapping
the glass by standing  his toes
mike could push the window up
part way and reach through the
ldrs

  yuh in there boy

  that would be jubal lark out-
side under the window speaking
guardedly

might be if i could talk to him out
of town thered be a different story

  fatty little lawyer named san-
ders jubal lark repeated out of
the darkness under the jail window
yuh ride out the drippin springs
trail an find yore beef drive boy
ive toted in slicker game than fatty
little lawyers yuhll git yore talk
with him jubal larks a-promisin
hit an dont waste yore time in
there them drunken fools is
a-gatherin an a-inchin up to a
lynchin im wishin yuh luck

  thanks

jubal lark evidently vanished
quickly again for he did not reply

  all chambers in the six-gun he
had brought were loaded mike
shoved it under his belt closed the
window and moved the cot back
then he pulled on his muddy coat
and buttoned it over the gun his
hat had evidently been left in the
muddy street

  the left arm was stiff and pain-
ful but usable his head was feel-
ing better from the moment the
gun came through the window
strength and hope had come flood-
ing back one friend outside had
been all he needed he had two
three if you counted the young
doctor mike mcbride had a
chance now

for a moment mike had the feel-
ing that old concho was close
watching waiting for mike mcbride
to fight out of this trouble and start
for those heights which concho had
planned

  men might die concho might be
avenged but there was more to it
than that more than a jail cell
more than revenge for concho and
smooth trickery this was the first
testing of mike mcbride who one
day had to be all those things that
concho walker might have been

and the girls reply was steadier
than he expected

  youre the one they want she
guessed swiftly

  she was small and slim and her
eyes were unhappy and mike
would have known that clear note
in her voice anywhere

  youre judy shelton

  she nodded

  got here in a hurry to help hang
me didnt you must run in the
family

that brought a blaze into her
eyes - hed thought her young
but not so young not younger
than himself looking now it was
hard to believe shed held him up by
the black butte as coolly as a man

  i believed you about jakes
money belt she said scornfully
and you rode into town and killed
the man who was hiring you

  you know the straight of it
mike threw at her you knew the

truth out there tonight ban shel-
ton and his gambler friends did the
killing tonight pity you aint a
third brother id start on you
they voted for a sheriff last year
an got a buzzard he made the
law gun law mike lifted the 
im raising him with six-guns him
an his friends an any more of the
shelton breed thats running a loop
on this range

  a drunken yell split the night out-
side whatre we waitin for
lets git him

  mike grinned mirthlessly that
would sound good to your brother
ban better get in the back room

the gamblers foot caught in
the stirrup as he left the sad-
dle and he plunged under the
hoofs of the maddened horse
death takes a tally



these windows wont stop lead
he turned the light out as he spoke

  and through the swift blackness
that fell between them judy shel-
ton cried in protest theyll kill
you brazos jones is leading them
i  i saw him when i came in
there must be some other way i
   ill help you

  never heard of brazos jones
and the sheltons mike answered
her bitterly have helped me
enough get back out o the way
hellll be popping in a minute
mike opened the door he was
in blackness cloudy moonlight
brushed shadowy pallor over the
muddy street outside the jail
enough light to see the gathering
crowd twoscore or more some
hanging back beyond the hitch rack
and spreading to right and left along
the slippery plank walk most of
them liquored up by the noise they
were making and the leaders al-
ready close to the jail steps bunch-
ing up behind a broad-shouldered
powerful man who had drawn a gun
and shouted as the door opened
thats right tomkins open
up all we want is that young
killer come out with yore hands
up an you wont have any trouble
one quick look placed the men
there was enough light to mark the
big fellow shouting at the doorway
he must be brazos jones he was
the burly red-faced gambler with
the bushy black brows and hairy
arms who had been sitting at con-
chos right hand in the back of the
stag saloon one of the men whod
murdered concho

  mike could have opened fire from
the dark doorway and riddled bra-
zos jones and some of the drunken
men behind jones dropped them
before they broke into the jail
scattered them in panic for a few
moments but if he did that in

years to come the dead men would
haunt mike mcbride many of the
drunks were convinced that the pris-
oner was a killer sober theyd look
at the dead who hadnt fired a shot
and swear that all charges against
mike mcbride must be true

  mike made an instant choice be-
fore he moved-and took the greater
risk

  stand back dont shoot he
yelled as he dived out of the dark
doorway

chapter x

circle  talks war

uncertainty stopped even
brazos jones while a man
might count four in that time
mike dodged to the right along the
front of the jail cocked guns silent
the hell of gunfire and death hang-
ing by a thread

  then a bawl of anger came from
jones thats mcbride get him

  the big gamblers gun crashed
furiously at the shadowy figure
plunging to the corner of the build-
ing three shots came almost as
one while mike gambled with death
to reach that jail corner without
killing a man and maybe he was
a fool and maybe not concho
would know

  a foot slipped on the rain-soft
ground as he ducked around the cor-
ner he stumbled found footing
and raced toward the back of the
jail other guns had opened up
the lynch crowd was milling in ex-
citement and uncertainty some of
them not sure yet what was happen-
ing

  brazos jones dashed around to
the side of the jail mike spun
around saw the big figure the red-
spurting gun muzzle the smile
that bared his teeth was cold and
hard as the two big s blasted and


street  smiths western story

roared in his hands the gambler
and a man or two bolder than the
rest were leading the wolf pack to
kill for years mike mcbride had
been growing up for this moment
music and a wild surging excite-
ment were in the six-guns that
blasted and bucked in his hands
head and wounded ann were for-
gotten screaming lead fanned
death about him and he had no
thought for it as he triggered at the
gamblers shadowy figure at the
front of the building

 the men behind brazos jones
and others on the plank walk out
front dashed back and aside from
the red gun muzzles that had sud-
denly turned on them

  brazos jones jumped into the
shadows beside the jail building-
and then lurched out staggering a
step or two as he fell

 there he is concho mike
yelled maybe hes the one

 excitement had him now like
whiskey running fire in his blood
gun law they wanted and gun law
theyd get the man behind the
jail must have yelled several times
before mike heard him

  mcbride you jool fork tjiis
horse

then mike realized hed been
standing there shouting for bra-
zos jones and the others to come
and get him theyd given him
open space clear out into the street
and brazos jones was huddled on
the muddy ground where he had
fallen

  the man behind the jail was in
the saddle and leading another sad-
dled horse mike made a flying
jump clawed into the saddle found
the stirrups and grabbed for the
reins as the man spurred away yell-
ing this way

  jubal lark wasnt there as he

followed mike recognized the gray
hat and black suit of the man hed
last seen in front of the hotel

 are you monte hill mike
called as he spurred alongside

  shut up and ride theyll be
after us this way

  monte hill galloped through an
open lot away from the main street
dogs ran barking at them they
passed lighted windows and staring
figures in open doorways then
they were past the last houses and
corrals racing into the south

  the old fellow said youd go to
dripping springs monte hill
called

  our herd wont get that far to-
night thanks for the help ill
make it all right now

  im siding you pour it on

  miles out of town east of the
stage road they reined up a second
time they were alone in the vast
night

  lost em monte hill decided

  this makes a second favor i owe
you mike said are you sure ju-
bal lark didnt get hurt

  he had some business thatd
keep him a while said monte hill
hell be all right

  miles farther on they crossed the
dripping springs trail mike guid-
ing and rode south and east for the
salt fork crossing and black butte
mikes thoughts turned back to
judy shelton young and anguished
as she had again abruptly sided with
him

  sheltons sister was at the jail
mike said aloud

  monte hill nodded i saw her
ride by the livery barn by the
looks of her horse shed come fast
must have heard about her brother
jake

  she found his body mike said
i met her there when i got the
money belt to bring to the sheriff
death takes a tally



   that the way you got it

   mike told him what had hap-
 pened from jump-johns death to
 the lawyers visit to the jail

    i had an idea sheltons story was
 wrong monte hill said coolly
 good riddance to jake so dude
 ringold parson pitts and shelton
 are after your ranch

   those first two names are new
 gamblers monte hill said
 dude ringolds good-looking with
  a light mustache hed rob his own
 mother i hear that parson pitts
 was in the poker game too hes
 worse they were friends of shel-
 ton back in texas

   know plentv about them dont
 you

   monte hill shrugged ive been
 through texas what do you aim
 to do now

   maybe ill have an idea by
 morning

   youd better monte hill re-
 marked because ban shelton will
 have ideas tonight

 they were pushing the horses
 by monte hills watch it was
 past one thirty when they forded
 the salt fork miles south of black
 butte by three they sighted the
 wan glow of the circle  wagon fire
 and hailed gus delight riding night
 trick on the bedded steers

   jump-john had been buried and
 the cattle thrown on a bed ground a
 mile or so away gus delight was
 profane with dismayed anger as he
 rode with them to the sleeping men
 near the fire

   crawl out conchos dead git
 out all of yuh an hear trouble
 they came awake-jim crowder
 slim chance sam parks larrupin
 ed shaw dozy the cook and
 guaymas red the part mexican
 wrangler with red hair whod rather
 use a knife than a gun

  and as fresh damp wood sizzled
on the fire guaymas red was as
bitter as the rest when mike told
what had happened

  larrupin ed shaw spoke the vio-
lent thought of every man

  well ride in on them snakes
damn if id only gone along

  monte hill spoke coolly ban
sheltons not there tonight half
the towns still drunk enough to
think mcbride killed your boss
better wait

  you tink we do nothing for
thees guaymas red said angrily

  im waiting lor this man jubal
lark mike said well want good
horses ready red dozy how
about some coffee the rest of you
better sleep it out till daybreak

  but there was no sleeping gun
belts and rifles were brought to the
fire and checked hot coffee warmed
them and questions were volleyed at
mike until all details were known

  if that damned lawyer gets here
hell talk larrupin ed harshly
promised

  hell talk mike agreed and no-
ticed monte hill watching him re-
flectively the man was younger
than hed seemed at first and more
of a mystery than ever

  the steers grazed out as the false
dawn gave way to the first faint
gray monte hill had wrapped him-
self in a borrowed blanket and tarp
and slept near the fire mike moved
stiffly about thinking even now it
was hard to believe that concho was
dead that he himself was on his
own now

  jubal lark hadnt appeared by
the time dozy called grub the
clouds were thinning a scarlet sun-
rise colored the east monte hill
rolled out of his blanket and joined
mike

  time enough for that old fellow
to be here


street  smiths western story

  i dont like it mike admitted
i should have stayed

  theyd have hunted you down
that lawyer said mike was
mj only chance to show crooked
work im outlawed sheltonll
make sure im hunted mike spoke
savagely killing ban shelton
might make it worse im through
on this range no matter what i do
going to quit and run

  whats it to you mike said
curtly

  monte hill was silent for a mo-
ment before he drawled

  judy shelton helped her broth-
ers take out from stock detectives
who were ready to send them to the
pen one of the detectives had been
fool enough to tell her hoping shed
understand what he had to do she
didnt tell her brothers he wasnt the
gambler they thought he was but
after they were safely gone judy
told the man she was through with
him shed never marry anyone
who might take her brothers to
court shed never marry anyway
and disgrace a husband with her
brothers she said she was young
and broken up and she meant it
he had to leave and a year later
he came back judys mother was
dead of heartbreak they said and
judy had gone west to the screw-
jack country he came after her
and found shed joined her brothers
and hadnt changed her mind so
he stayed around to see if the broth-
ers wouldnt hang themselves by
their own cussedness after folks
found them out

  and youre hoping this will do
it mike guessed

  hoping like hell monte hill
drawled since im hogtied and
helpless because of judy

  i wondered about you mike
admitted maybe well both have
luck

 they were eating when dozy
called from the grub wagon whos
a-comin

  riders had topped the slope to
the west-four riders loping toward
the wagon one man wore a white
sombrero that brought mike to his
feet

  thats shelton the sheriff
mike said grimly

gun talk

larrupin ed picked up his
rifle sit tight mike they
aint gonna get you

  mike grinned coldly meet him
on the other side of the wagon ill
keep out of sight for a minute
monte hill joined mike behind
the wagon hes fast with a gun
he warned theres only three men
with him but he rode out of salt
fork with nine or ten last night
mike looked past the wagon seat
aint that the card sharp parson
pitts with him

  and lafe cantwell and montana
jack said monte hill looking
theyre killers

  standing there behind the wagon
they heard larrupin ed greet the
newcomers

  howdy gents

own men named mcbride the
sheriffs got mcbride locked up in
salt fork for trial walker lost his
ranch in a card game before he was
killed you men can have your pay
and move on this morning
death takes a tally



  gus delights voice exploded high
and angrily

  no tinhorn gambler that oughta
got what this jake shelton got fires
me from anywhere while  got a
hawglaig tuh talk-

  a gunshot blotted out the rest
of his defiance and gus slid to the
ground in an inert heap

  larrupin ed shouted that
man murdered him sheriff

  he pulled a gun on a deputy
ban shelton rasped back throw
down them guns and step back
while we take over whos that be-
hind the wagon

mike thumbed both guns as he
dived for the end of the wagon
no time now to plan further gus
delights foolish outburst had set off
a killers gun and hell had started
hell that would leave ban shelton
running the salt fork country or
stop him here in the scarlet dawn

  shelton was waiting his gun
blasted as mike plunged into the
open behind the wagon

  the big smoke-blackened coffee-
pot flew off the tailboard and show-
ered mike with hot coffee and as
a second shot roared on the heels of
the first shelton recognized the
bandaged head that should have
been back in salt fork in jail or on
the end of a lynch rope

  shelton yelled and missed the sec-
ond shot clean the drive of his
spurs sent his horse bolting with
circle  men between him and
mikes guns

  mike fired over their heads and
missed the running horse and
crouching figure the slam of a bul-
let in his left arm already wounded
knocked him half around

  that lead came from the gunman
that monte hill had pointed out as
montana jack the numbing shock

left the arm useless as mike got his
other gun up again

  montana jack had fired hastily as
he reined his horse away now he
was spurring away after the others

  mike stumbled past sam parks
and jim crowder and aimed care-
fully as he emptied the old wooden-
handled  montana jack lurched
in the saddle grabbed the horn and
rode on wounded but burring tight
to the saddle

  around mike guns were crashing
but the targets were moving fast
out of range scattering as they
went

  monte hill ran past mike with a
rifle and took careful aim he fired
once and missed coolly levered an-
other cartridge in and aimed again
his target was the gaunt parson
pitts who was riding in a crouch
black coat tails flapping in the wind

  monte hills rifle cracked a sec-
ond time-and a second time he
seemed to miss his angry exclama-
tion was audible as he hastily re-
loaded

  then a wild indian yell came
from guaymas bed the flapping
black coat tails were leaving the sad-
dle parson pitts was sliding over
clawing weakly at the saddlehorn
then he seemed to stiffen as he
pitched from the saddle

  look slim chance shouted

  the gamblers head and shoulders
had hit the damp ground and
bounced and bounced again and
again

 the shooting had stopped
around mike the men stood frozen
as the gamblers foot stayed caught
in the stirrup and he dragged under
the driving hoofs of the maddened
horse

  mike thought he heard a thin far
horrible scream from under the run-
ning horse he wasnt sure it
came no more the dragging body


street  smiths western story

was limp now and the coat tails had
dropped down over the head and
were flapping grotesquely as flying
hoofs shredded cloth and flesh and
bone

  shoot the horse mike cried
hoarsely

  monte hill already had the rifle
up he took his time before squeez-
ing the trigger and dropped the
horse kicking and helpless near the
top of the slope the inert body
was pinned underneath

  he come askin for it larrup-
in ed said harshly but damned
if i wish any man that

  shelton and the other two men
were out of sight now thered been
no time to look to gus delight who
had dragged himself over against the
hind wheel of the wagon

  mike could feel the warm blood
over his arm as he stooped by gus
delights round drawn face

  how bad is it gus

  gus delight tried to grin busted
up a rib an missed the lung i think
i dont feel no blood in my throat
we showed em where to get off
didnt we aint that blood on yore
arm mike

  nothing to think about get
flat on the ground and lets have a
look and mike called over his
shoulder get the horses theres
something funny about that sheriff
only bringing three men i dont-
he broke off demanding whats
that

 guaymas red was nearest the
back of the wagon and he too had
heard the sudden rolling stamp of
hoofs the high alarmed bellow of
startled cattle then a fusillade of
shots before guaymas red could
speak

 stampede guaymas red
yelled bolting for his horse

chapter xii

six-gun stampede

under the wagon mike caught
a glimpse of the cattle coming
in a senseless wave of rushing bod-
ies and clashing horns theyd been
started and pointed by a thin line
of riders who had come down on
them from the east

  now it was plain why ban shel-
ton had come with only three men
why the circle  men had been told
to get their time why shelton
hadnt stood his ground to fight
shelton had parlayed while other
riders had circled around to get set
for surprise and trouble

  the wagon offered some shelter
but the stampede would carry away
their horses theyd be afoot and
helpless around the wagon cold tar-
gets for hidden men whose rifles
could pick them off one by one

  ride it out mike shouted
take your guns

  there was still gus delight help-
less on the ground and for the mo-
ment all but forgotten mike
jumped toward him monte hill
got there first shouting as he lifted
gus delights chunky figure

  hit the saddle mcbride ill do
this

  mike lingered to make sure while
the bawling tornado of frightened
steers bore down on the spot the
saddled horses that had stayed
ground-tied near the wagon through
the shooting were catching the
panic too and starting to move as
the circle  men plunged to them

  monte hill all but threw gus de-
light into the front of the wagon
rough treatment but gus would
have to take it mike ran for his
horse and it bolted then slim
chance came spurring stooped far
over caught the dragging reins and
yanked the horse over to mike
death takes a tally



  larrupin ed shaw had seen how
tilings were with monte hill and
had gotten his horse and was bring-
ing it at a run

  mikes arm was still numb to the
shoulder he had to get into the
saddle one-handed he saw blood
running over the wrist and fingers
as his feet found the stirrups and
his good hand took the slack out of
the reins then the first of the
bawling thundering stampede was
on them and the horse needed no
spurring as it raced away

  over his shoulder mike saw
monte hills horse stumble as a big
steer brushed it and then settle into
stride there was no dust ban
sheltons men were plain at the rear
of the stampede nine or ten of
them at least shooting forward
over the cattle

  they had failed to put the cir-
cle  men afoot now they were
trying to gun them from their
horses

a wild yell over to the right
dragged mikes look he
cursed helplessly as he saw jim
crowder pitching out of the saddle
jims horse kept on jim stayed
under the torrent of running steers

  ban shelton wanted it this way
for anyone who stood in the way of
his law gun law shelton law
that could wipe out an old man like
concho walker and all who tried
to stand up to him

  mike cut over toward larrupin
ed and slim chance who were fol-
lowing guaymas red and monte
hill to the west flank of the stam-
pede dozy and sam parks were
coining also

  they were outnumbered if they
scattered now theyd stay scattered
the circle  land and cattle would
be in other hands

  looking back mike could see the

gunmen bunching up to follow them
ban shelton and the two men with
him evidently hadnt circled fast
enough to swing in behind the stam-
pede

  monte hill rode close looks
like shelton pulled a trick thatll be
hard to beat

  they were plunging over a brushy
ridge now with the stampede swerv-
ing off over the lower ground the
shelton men were following up the
slope shooting as mike called

  aint a chance to whip that
bunch scatter the boys an keep
riding sheltons menll give up
after a few miles

  monte hill nodded his look was
regretful disappointed mike mc-
bride was quitting after all his talk
of blocking shelton

  they topped the ridge and raced
down through the brush hidden for
a little from the guns behind mike
lagged swinging to the left monte
hill caught up with larrupin ed
and the others urging them ahead

  dozy and sam parks passed on
as mike pulled his horse hard over
along the ridge paralleling the top
brush and low trees closed in behind
him when hed ridden a hundred
and fifty yards and pulled up the
others were out of sight crashing on
down the slope

  mike dismounted behind low
bushes as the shelton men topped
the ridge in a bunch quirting spur-
ring after the fleeing riders ahead
they swept on down the slope with-
out looking toward the brush where
mike waited

  blood covered mikes left hand
and the throbbing hurt went up into
the shoulder but he could use the
hand a little and reload both six-
guns his rifle was back in salt
fork

  he was in the saddle again when
he heard another coming the man


street  smiths western story

cut the ridge and took the slope
his hat was black he showed in the
clear for an instant and he was the
gunman deputy that monte hill
had called lafe cantwell

  ragged bursts of gunfire marked 
the running fight moving off into
the west no one followed cantwell
as mike put his horse into a run
south along the ridge

  minutes later the distant gunfire
in the west seemed to double in in-
tensity as if the circle  men had
been caught and had turned to
fight mike fought down the urge
to head that way fast his grim
face was lined with strain as he kept
on

  the grub wagon was out there on
the sun-drenched flat parson
pitts horse was dead and had been
rolled off the body two saddled
horses stood restlessly nearby and
the two men near the body were
talking with some heat

  dude ringold handsome well-
dressed had a neck sling supporting
his left arm his voice was angrily
clear as mike stepped behind a small
tree and listened

youre talkin a lot but it dont
change me shelton i shot that
damn lamp out last night and put
the lead in the old coots back and
got a bullet in my arm for it ive
earned the parsons share and i
want it for the time ill be laid up
from gambling

  the idea was mine and the par-
sons in the first place shelton
rasped there aint too much to
go around as it is with that lawyer
euttin in for his share

  you cant claim the circle 
shelton therell be enough talk as
it is that greasy little lawyer aint
to be trusted an brazos hasnt got
the head or tongue for this youve
got to have me to handle the cir-

cle  ill have my price for it or
nobody cashes in savvy

  brazos dont think fast but hell
do what hes told ban shelton
sneered dude youve growed a
big head for a young fellow

  dude ringold jumped back grab-
bing under his coat then the vom-
iting six-gun in ban sheltons hand
slammed him against the earth and
lie stayed there trying weakly to
get his gun out

  ban shelton tore the gun from
him threw it away and grinned
down at the dying man

  thats your cut dude the
parson an me was savin it for
you shelton was not a hundred
yards away back partly turned to
the crest of the slope as mike
stepped out toward him

  ill take your money belt you
wont need it shelton said as he
knelt by the young gambler he
had jerked the money belt out and
was getting to his feet when mike
spoke

  ive brought your cut shelton
ban shelton whirled around-and
for an instant his angular face was
stunned unbelieving then he
hurled the belt aside and his pearl
handled gun streaked from the hol-
ster blasting as it came out

  mikes gun met shot for shot
handicapped by the sun into which
he was facing a bullet nicked his
ear shelton staggered as lead tore
into his leg his gun emptied as he
reached for dude ringolds gun and
he made a lurching dive and caught
up the gamblers gun

  one-handed mike dropped his
empty gun and caught the other
from under his belt without stopping
his advance

  that broke ban sheltons nerve
he made a limping break for his
horse which jumped back nerv-
ously
death takes a tally



  mike ran forward he had three
shots left and no time to reload if
shelton started riding shelton got
the reins and cursed the horse wildly
as he caught the saddle and swung
awkwardly up

  for an instant he was silhouetted
against the blazing morning sun
mike stopped steadied and emptied
the second gun in a roaring roll of
shots that hurled ban shelton out
of the saddle in a sprawling fall as
the horse bolted away

  mike stood grimly by the man as
he died he had had the feeling
when he sighted shelton a few min-
utes back that it would end this
way

  shelton died first with dude rin-
gold lying on his side staring at the
sight with a thin fixed grin

  mike looked around his voice
was husky concho i didnt aim
to make the start this way you
figure it out

  he went back for his horse and
rode to the wagon gus delight
was still alive hed keep on living
gus was on the ground again with
his shirt off when the first of a
straggling line of riders swept down
on them

  larrupin ed and monte hill
were leading close behind them
galloped the buckskin-clad figure of
old jubal lark

dont know what happened but
it looks good mike said to
gus delight the riders were
around them a few moments later
strange faces riding up smiling
faces that gathered around while
jubal lark leaped down brandish-
ing an old rifle and whooping

  hows this fer fixin yore busi-
ness boy i cotched that snaky lit-
tle law talker in his office as he was
a-fixin to ride to sheltons ranch

sawed a knife agin his throat an
he talked an give me the papers

he squealed as how them gamblers
an a sheriffs posse was cornin to
get yore cattle at daybreak all legal

  jubal spat again and continued
i taken him to the young doc to
tell his story sheltons sister was

ied the papers concho signed an
heered the lawyer talk again an
the doc run out to see men he saidd

time to get em all together an stop

demon an pithypuss

by s omar barker

  you might doubt that a duck can
swim that a skunk sucks eggs or
that hawg fat will sizzle in hades
but on the shoe bar ranch there
was one thing considered as sure and
undoubtable as cockleburs in a coy-
otes tail even pinch-pocket pat-
terson had been to town and bet
twenty dollars on it and pinch was
a man who wouldntve put up half
that many cents on tomorrows sun-
rise the rest of the boys as far
as they could find takers had done
dug deep and laid it on the line

 duff moser the ramrod ex-
pressed the unanimous views of all
shoe bar hands-and many others
-in the statement he give editor
strawn for the ganado gazette

  in this here forthcomin range
reunion and rodeo he said i
aint claimin my boys will top the
pile in all events the bronc ridin
the bulldoggin the steer straddlin
the calf ropin even this here cow-
boy-singin contest-its liable to be
nip tuck and tickle who takes em
but in the team-steer ropin you
can print it right out on the front
page that the shoe bar team of ran-
som and mccorkadale aint been
cant be and wont be beat the
way they work together its a won-
der they aint twins

  pals are they inquired editor
strawn

  well said duff moser ive no-
ticed one of em cant even itch
without the other un starts scratch-

in

like damon and pythias eh
i dont know about that
shrugged the shoe bar ramrod for
ive never seen this demon and

pithypuss perform but if theyre
aimin to rope in this contest they
just as well git their mouths fixed
for a dose of bitters because-

  i doubt if damon and pythias
will be entered editor strawn re-
assured him but i hear the box l
has a couple of new boys that rate
pretty high their ownselves bud
ross and sam hicks i believe their
names are

  ringers snorted duff moser
disdainful as a pup pretending he
hasnt noticed the old tomcat spit-
tin at him rodeo professionals
arena roosters big-time tuckahoos
dragged in by the heels an signed
on as ranch hands jest to qualify for
this rodeo because the box l aint
got no ropers amongst their regular
hands that stands a chinamans
chance well they still aint not
agin rowdy ransom an mac mc-
corkadale you got any bettin
money itchin you strawn jest take
my word where to lay it

  here have a drink smiled
strawn fudging a half-empty bot-
tle out of his desk maybe i will

you take a pack of coon dogs
and theres always some
amongst em thatll bristle up over
who gits to the tree first this is
known in the dictionary as a uni-
versal human habit called rivalry
or who treed the coon

  same way with cow outfits and
in the ganado country the shoe bar
and the box l was the main pair
of rivals thats why it made the
shoe bar boys so happy to know
that their steer-tyin team was un-


beatable even by this pair of rodeo
ringers

  thats how it was a few even ins
before the ganado range reunion
and rodeo when they gathered in
the bunkhouse to practice up some
on their cowboy singin the gan-
ado ladies social literary and
business society had hatched out
the idee of a buckaroo ballard-bell-
erin contest in connection with the
rodeo and as they was in the habit
of doing everything else together
rowdy ransom and mac mccork-
adale was entered for a duet

  rowdys voice was a beery-tone
macs a whiskey tenor and the piece
they choose to sing was that sad
and sentimental old ballard called
the trail to mexico

  when mac come in that evenin
rowdy was already singin

i made up my mind to change my way
an quit my crowd that was so gay

to leave my nay-ay-ay-tive home for a
   while

an travel west for-

  wup a minute rowdy says
mac reaching for the guitar with


street  smiths western story

a hand big enough to choke an ele-
phant you got the tune all right
but the words goes like this

i made up my mind in an early day
that id leave my gal-she was too gay
that id leave my home an roam for a
while

an travel west for many a mile

  now then he goes on whang-
ing more or less of a chord on the
guitar and fixing his number leven
mouth like he was about tospit out
a prune seed lets try it together
rowdy ransom had got his nick-
name for being just the opposite of
what it labeled him its not an
unfrequent custom amongst the cow-
boys you take a feller so skinny
that he has to hire help to throw a
shadow and theyre liable to name
him fat i knowed a waddy once
that outbellered a bull every time
he flapped his tonsils and they called
iiim whisper so rowdy wasnt
really no rowdy he was a mild-
eved quiet-spoken little man but
shoulder-built like a bull yearling
and plenty able in the muscles

  all right he says we gonna
sing it your way or mine

  why the right way o course
o k lets hit er

  they hit the first five words to-
gether all night then it begun to
jangle for while rowdy was bravely
beery-toning to change my way
mac made melody on in an early
day they stayed with it through
the second line anyhow then ol
mac slapped his big paw acrost the
guitars belly all of a sudden and
give a snort

  dammit rowdy he says do
you know the words to this here
song or dont yuh

  why sure says rowdy mild
as a muslin mitten it goes-

  it dont no suchuva busts in
mccorkadale this heres the bal-
lard of a buckaroo that took to the

lonesome trail on account of a fe-
male woman that was cuttin up too
gay with other fellers-like it says
in the second line that id leave
my gal-she was too gay did you
ever hear of a cowboy runnin off
to a life of sin sorrow an shootin
on account of a whole crowd bein
too gay for him

  why sure says rowdy in
this song i did

  youre crazy as a locoed-

  hold on here a minute boys
interposes duff moser soothingly
as i recollect it this here ballard
has got plenty verses if you cant
git together on the first un why not
jest spare it an start off with the
second

  why sure agrees rowdy and
lets in to sing

 twas in the merry month of may
when i started for texas far away

i left my darling gal behind

she said her heart was only mine

  rowdy exclaims mac ive
been knowin this song ever since
hell caught afire an there aint no
suchuva verse in it the second
stanzer goes like this

 twas in the year eightv-three
that a j stinson hired me

he says young feller i want you to go
an feller my herd down to mexico 

  as mac brung his tender tenor
to a double demi-semi-quaverin
conclusion rowdy ransom was seen
to shake his head and kinder of a
saw-tooth edge begun to creep into
that quiet way he had of speaking

  rights right an wrongs wrong
mac he says even in a song
that theres the third verse-only
you got it plumb wrong heres
the rightful way it goes

 twas in the spring of eighty-three
that ol jim stinson said to me

young man how would you like to go
with a herd of steers to new mexico 
demon an pithypuss



  for a mild little mgi with only
one upper lip rowdy sure bellered
it big and bold bearing down per-
tiekerly hard on the words that was
different from ol macs

  there brother ballard buster
he says when hes finished if them
oversize ears of yours aint too fuzzy
with jackass hair now you know
how it goes

  jackass ears huh snorts mc-
corkadale slamming down the gui-
tar well at least i got something
besides jackass brains between em
yeah grunts rowdy ransom
mostly bone

  bone huh mccorkadale flares
up like somebody had lit a match to
him and his voice gits plumb con-
temptuous why you little sawed-
off sonuva short-horn-

 right there was where rowdy
ransom hit him-between the
sonuva and the short-horn
mccorkadale never even took time
to look surprised the roundhouse
right that he swang at rowdy ran-
soms jaw would of downed a drome-
dary but it never fazed rowdy a
mite-because it never hit him but
the left that follered it connected
and from there on for about a min-
ute it was a sure nough dog fight
then duff moser link cassidy joe
clark pinch-pocket patterson big-
nose george swarmed on em from
all directions and pulled em apart

  shame on you says the ram-
rod fightin over the fool words
to a fool song like a couple of didey
buttons

  duff says rowdy ransom wip-
ing a little streak of blood from his
lip but not sounding noways ex-
cited aint you rambled the range
long enough to learn that it aint
manners to interfere in a fair fight
it sure as hell aint snorts mc-
corkadale jest turn me a-loose
an ill-

  sure busts in the ramrod
turn you a-loose an youd both
spit out your teeth to spite your
spleen how you ever expect to-
for my part we dont busts
in mac either he agrees to sing
this here song right or the duets
done cancelled

  suits me shrugs rowdy i
never hankered to hitch up for no
duet with no whiskey-tenored hawg-
caller in the first place

  why that settles it then says
the ramrod soothing as sugar-sirup
call off the duet an everybodys
satisfied

  now youre talkin agrees
pinch-pocket patterson who gives
a durn about them ol hens an their
cowboy croonin contest anyways
my moneys on the steer ropin an
if you two grapplin galoots dont
git out there an win it bv gollies
ill-

  steer ropin hah snorts mac
mccorkadale you think im go-
in to team up in a public ropin with
a lillypewshun lunkhead that blows
up an lambastes his own partner
jest because hes too dumb his own-
self to recollect the right words to
a little ol song hah

  but listen you fellers duff
moser still tries to smooth em down
the honor of the whole shoe bar
outfit is staked on that steer ropin
our moneys done bet an-

  you better unbet it then if you
can interposes rowdy ransom
quiet but firm for as far as im
concerned the ropin team of ran-
som and mccork-the-dull has sure
nough come to the partin of the
ways

doubt if you will that a duck
can quack that your saddle
will turn when the cinch gits slack
but dont you never doubt but what
them two shoe bar rannyhans had


street  smiths western story

their necks bowed by threatenin
to bonnet em with slop buckets and
pen em up with the hawgs duff
moser and the boys did manage to
kinder hold em apart for the time
being he appointed link cassidy
and joe clark to take turns hang-
ing onto rowdy whilst pinch-pocket
patterson and big-nose george
drawed the same responsibility for
mccorkadale

  if we ever let em tangle to a
finish fists or guns says duff
there wont be enough left of either
one of em to rope a rabbit much
less a thousand-pound steer as
long as we can keep em apart
theres always a chance they may
cool off an make up in time to git
into that team-tyin contest after
all

  but there wasnt much prospect
of it follering the bust up them
two formerly pardners wouldnt
even speak to each other mean-
time the rest of them shoe bar
waddies was gittin plumb frantic
when they seen threatening
wouldnt do no good they let in
to beg

  listen rowdy pleads link
cassidy it aint fair to the rest
of us boys weve done bet ever
cent we got on you an mac-ive
even put up my saddle-to win that
ropin

  better cancel your bets then
says rowdy we aint teamin

  try cancellin hell with a cup of
coffee says link  sheriff
millwees holdin the stakes duffs
done been to see him he maintains
a bets a bet an as stakeholder he
aint goin to cancel nothin unless
we git them box l boogers were
bettin agin to agree to it per-
sonally id rather lose forty saddles
than humilimate myself by beggin
them bull-whackers to let me off

  i wouldnt says pinch-pocket

in fact ive done been over and
tried it they say all their side of
the bets was that ross an hicks
would win the steer-ropin an
whether our men rope or not aint
got no bearing on it

  damn the bets says big-nose
george its the disgrace of let-
tin them box l lollypops walk off
with a win after all the big medicine
weve made about it

  well says rowdy lookin
at it from that angle ill swaller my
insults on one condition git holt of
a songbook with the trail to mex-
ico in it an if it shows them words
to be the way mccorkadale claims
ill not only sing it his way in the
duet but ill also git out there and
help him win that steer ropin
when they put the same proposi-
tion to mac he faunched around
right smart but finally agreed to
abide by the same conditions

  course he says there aint no
question which one of us is right
an any honest song book in the
world will prove it

  trouble was there didnt seem to
be no song book in the whole town
of ganado that even mentioned such
a ballard as the trail to mexico
ive studied through ever hymn
book in both churches groans
pinch-pocket patterson reporting to
duff moser out back of the chutes
not moren a half hour before the
rodeo was due to commence they
got plenty pieces on the trail to
heaven but nary a mention of mex-
ico

  kinder peculiar too complains
joe clark ive noticed a heap
more people headin for mexico than
i have for heaven- well it looks
like- wup looky yonder you
reckon theyve gone an made up
it sure looked like it for yonder
was rowdy ransom and mac mc-
corkadale a-straddle of their ropin
demon an pithypuss



ponies ridin from the stable toward
the outside gate side by side

  i told link an big-nose not to
let them two git together snorts
duff moser look they got their
guns on we better see whats up
the three of em overtaken rowdy
and mac just inside the gate

  well boys inquires duff

a little

  limber up hell snorts mccork-
adale were goin outside to set-
tle this here disagreement once an
for all

  like gentlemen an cowboys
agrees rowdy he pats the holt of
his six-gun plumb significant

  if it hadnt been for the gate-
man old snapper smith swinging
the gate shut quick when duff hol-
lered to him they just might of done
it too as it was duff and pinch-
pocket and joe clark got between
em rowdy and mac looked at the
ten or a dozen box l cowboys ap-
proaching from the stables then at
each other

  we dont want no box l audi-
ence rowdy says mac suppos-
in we tend to this later

  sure says rowdy anyways
link says hes got wind of an old
feller thatll prove-

  prove hell snorts mccorkadale
ill prove to you that-

  he didnt git to say what on ac-
count of the grinnin arrival of them
box l hands

  hiyah songbirds they all sing
out together any more cash to
lay on the team-tyin

  sure says duff moser grimly
yampin some bills from his pocket
thirty more that the team of ran-
som and mccorkadale wins it
you shouldnt ort to of done
that duff says rowdy after them
box ls had rode on to line up for
the grand entry you know there
ws-b

aint no such team any more an
wont be unless-

  unless we show you that song
in a book provin which one of you
is right that theres the promise
you made us youre still aimin
to keep it aint you

  yeah grunts mac but-
you an joe stay with em pinch-
pocket busts in the ramrod sud-
denly spurrin for the grandstand
gate im going after that song
book

  what duff had got suddenly took
with was a good-enough idea all
right if it would work the droop-
eyed hombre he grabbed at the
grandstand gate was editor strawn
of the ganado gazette on duffs
tip strawn had bet some money on
rowdy and mac his ownself and he
already knowed about the bust-up

  looky here strawn says duff
when he got him cornered all we
got to do is show them boys that
blasted song printed out in a book
an theyve agreed to abide by same
an call the feud off well we cant
find it in no song book but whats
to keep you from rushin right down
to your place an printin one
whaz prevent says editor
strawn jush three thingsh pre-
vent mishter mossher number
one printing takesh time itssh
too late now number two shopsh
outa paper because the editor used
paper money to bet on shteer-rop-
ing number three only one
printer in town-thash me-ssh
hesh drunk

so the ganado range rodeo
banged open it come on to the
big main event of team steer rop-
ing and the shoe bar still didnt
have no prospect of winning for the
unbeatable team of rowdy and mac
was still hatin each others innards
over a song not only that but


street  smiths western story

both link cassidy and big-nose
george were missing which broke
up both of the shoe bars other en-
tries

  i leave them honyaks to keep
watch over rowdy and mac com-
plained duff moser an they not
only dont do it but plumb disap-
pear into the bargain i wisht to
hell-

  he busted off all of a sudden for
yonder come link cassidy racing
acrost the track waving a guitar

  hey duff he pants i got
him bring em over here behind
the grandstand

you mean runnin off when i-
or nick shortridge rowdy an
mac-an pronto before the team-
ropins over

  still without savvyin what it was
about duff with joe clark and
pinch-pocket to help him managed
somehow to haze them two feudin
ropers around behind the stand

  there squattin against a post
was a weather-whipped little old
man with droughty whiskers and ir-
rigatin eyes

  boys says link this beats a
book meet mr nick shortridge
the feller that made up the trail
to mexico in the first place which
ive brung him here to settle this
song argument once an for all you
tell em how it goes granpa

  tetch me a chord says mr
shortridge my fingers is so stiff
i caint whang it no more

  so link give him the chord and
he cut er loose kinder shrill and
whiney but right strong for such
an old coot

i made up my mind in an early day
that id leave my gal-she was too gay-

  yuh see gloats mccorkadale
at the end of the first stanzer it
goes jest like i said it did

  quit interrumpin me young
squirt snaps the old man he
cuts loose on the stanzer about old
man stinson only danged if he dont
sing this un rowdys way endin
it up

 with a herd of steers to new mexico- 

  so now its rowdys turn to look
like the cat that caught the gopher
hes jest waiting for the old man
to let go of the double-demi-semi-
quaver on the last note before he
starts crowing for his side when all
of a sudden another old whiskerino
come hobbling around the corner
of the grandstand leanin on a cane
with one hand and on big-nose
george with the other he looks
plenty feeble but his voice aint

  drat your guzzle nick short-
ridge he bellers wont you never
learn the right words to that there
song it aint new mexico its
mex-

   taint no suchova busts in
mr shortridge bristling his whisk-
ers  jim stinson never drove
a steer to old mexico in his life he
demon an pithypuss



drove into new mexico at salt lake
swung past fort sumner an-

  what plumb drownded him out
was this other oldsters bobbed-wire
beller bawling out

 twas in the year of eighty-three

that a j stinson hired me

he says young feller i want you to go
an foller my herd down to mexico 

  thats the way it goes gents
he puffs an dont you let no wa-
tery-eved sniffle-snooted wabble-
tailed ol coot like nick shortridge
try to tell you different

  thats right boys says big-
nose george because i jest found
out that mr bunker here is the
feller that made it up in the first
place i reckon that ort to prove
that-

  prove my tail feathers whinnies
old nick shortridge i made up
that ballard myownself back in 
an if ab bunker claims different
hes a split-tongued storv-tellin ol
magpie

  why you cockle-bur-tailed o
sawed-off song-stealin sonuva short-
horn-

  right then was when old nick
shortridge hit him with his cane-
right between the sonuva and the
shorthorn the next thing any-
body knowed them two old whiske-
roosters was goin it for hell-aint-
half eane-whippin each other to
beat a bullfight

  strangely enough it was rowdy
ransom and mac mccorkadale that
jumped in quickest to pull em apart

  shame on you say mac two

old mossyhorns like you fightin
over the fool words to a fool song
we ort to bump your heads together
for you

  then all of a sudden mac seemed
to realized what lies sayin he
looks at rowdy ransom his num-
ber leven mouth kinder dangles
open and one of his ham-size hands
scratches his head kinder sheepish
rowdy ransom meets his look with
sort of a sickly grin

  seems like thats what they been
tryin to tell us mac he says
kinder silly aint it

  specially when we didnt neither
of us make up the dang song in the
first place grins mac listen-
theyre still callin up steer ropers
out there rowdy lets you an

          

me-

  get out there an show em how
its did

  well i be damned says duff
moser watchin em hightail it for
their hosses jest like demon and
pithypuss aint they

 that night when the shoe bar
team of winnin steer ropers also
teamed up on a duet in the ganado
ladies social literary and business
societys cowboy singing contest the
song they sung was the old
chisholm trail it had a new verse
in it that theyd made up their own-
selves

a kick in the pants or a punch in the
    nose-

who gives a hoot how the dang song goes
  coma ti yi yoopy yoopv yip yoopy yay
  its team-tyin steers that draws the pay

tonto town

by harry r keller

 in tonto town the silent streets
 lie buried in a drift of sand

 like corpses in their winding sheets
 the gaunt adobe houses stand

 time was when clamor filled the air

 and range-bred men all lean and brown

 came riding nightly to the blare
 of revelry in tonto town

 i know for i was one of these

 the wildest ranny of the band

 a wiry bronc between my knees

 a six-gun ready to my hand

 from fickle chance i caught my cue
 to swap hot lead or play the clown

 it mattered not when life was new-

 and likewise cheap-in tonto town

 i close my eyes and see them still

 the bearded freighters gray with dust

 the gun hawks spoiling for a kill

 the panther play of greed and lust

 the rabble in the dancing halls

 the lurid lips the gaudy gown-

 their shadows haunt the crumbling walls
 in tonto town in tonto town

 nor will i be forgetting this

 blue moonlight in a patio

 a touch of hands a breathless kiss

 a promise whispered soft and low

 too soon the eastern sky grew wan

 with morning light    her eyes were brown

 but she with all the rest is gone

 forever gone from tonto town

 the sun-bleached bones of cattle lie
 across the range that drought has swept

 beneath the brazen searing sky

 for twenty years the town has slept

 its darkened doorways mock the night

 like sightless eyes its windows frown

 but it is not deserted quite-

 my heart still lives in tonto town

in


aces and eights

        by ney n geer

long and the kid had left a few dead
men along it for sheriffs to worry
over the first to drop had been
dutch holtz owner of the saloon
where the kids father had been
fleeced of his cattle and range in
a crooked poker game then killed by
a derringer slug when he questioned
the honesty of three-finger jack a
fly-by-night tinhorn gambler it was
three-finger jack that the kid was
after and the tinhorns erratic wan-
derings were hard to follow the
gambler was constantly changing his
name and making long jumps be-
tween killings which invariably were

the powder river kid
was fast but he wasnt
expecting a sneak
draw from the tinhorn

  the powder river kid drew rein
at the high gap cutting through the
cascade range it had been a hard
climb up the east slope and his bay
gelding was winded with a caution
that had become habitual during the
past two years the kids blue eyes
narrowed intently as he looked back
across the tufted pines and scanned
his trail

  that trail was a thousand miles


street  smiths western story

the result of card games it was a
trail that had put bitter lines in the
kids young face and a sardonic
smile on lips which had once been
cheerful and friendly

  the powder river kid knew he
would find no rest from the morose
and brooding thoughts that drove
him along this trail of three-finger
jack until he sat face to face with
the crooked gambler across a poker
table for like many a man before
him-some of whom were now dead
-the kid had vowed to beat the tin-
horn at his own game a game of
draw-cards and guns

  the kid was not a fool however
by constant training his supple
hands had acquired a lightning
swiftness of movement that baffled
the eye even as he paused on the
trail one hand expertly worked with
a worn deck of cards switching the
lop half off the bottom then back
again suddenly his other hand
dropped reins and streaked to hol-
ster snapping out his colt in a sin-
gle motion that was quicker than
thought

  he laughed without mirth for his
back trail was empty and he was
entirely alone no danger threat-
ened he returned the colt to
leather changed hands with the
cards then executed a sudden cross-
hand draw a draw that was sudden
death to tinhorns three times since
leaving wyomings powder river
range the kid had used that draw
across a poker table and it was his
hunch that very soon he would use
it on three-finger jack lucky
gulch where a bonanza of placer
gold had been recently discovered
was not far ahead and the card sharp
was almost sure to be there un-
suspecting miners would be easy
picking for the tricky gambler

  the bay gelding nudged the slack
reins and stepped off along the trail

through the gap and on down the
west slope two days later the big
bronc picked its way into the new-
gold camp

  lucky gulch was a five-mile
stretch of looping curves where
rough-clad miners toiled thick as
ants using gold pans rockers long
toms and whip-sawed sluice boxes in
which to wash out the rich red gravel
and reap their golden harvest first
news of the strike had brought a wild
stampede not yet at its peak for the
population of the diggings was in-
creasing hourly excitement pre-
vailed everywhere the kid observed
and men moved about with tense
nerves calmly riding at a walk
through all this confusion the kid
came into stringtown which had
mushroomed up overnight

  stringtown was a double row of
tents and rough-board buildings
sprawling along the canyon trail
the kid saw hotels under canvas
gambling dens saloons and a few
stores the hot noon sun boiled
pitch from the towns raw lumber

  the most pretentious of all the
false-fronted buildings was the ace
high bar a combination saloon and
gambling joint the kid stopped at
the hitch rail before it found a
vacant place for his horse then en-
tered the bar which housed a brawl-
ing two-fisted hell-for-leather sort
of crowd well sprinkled with profes-
sional gamblers riffraff and outlaws
all seeking adventure and the quick-
est easiest way to turn a dishonest
dollar

  near the front end of the long bar
stood diamond joe more of a look-
out than a dispenser of drinks he
had observed the kid ride up and
gave him a close scrutiny as he
stepped inside diamond joe saw
with interest that this stranger was
well built and wore his gun in an
unusual fashion butt foremost on
aces and eights



his right hip also the stranger
looked capable and willing to use
that gun if and when occasion re-
quired

  diamond joes friendly smile was
a magnet that drew the kid to him
howdv cowboy the saloonman
called cheerfully name your poi-
son pilgrim a strangers first drink
is always free come far

  the kid smiled far enough to
be choked with dust he replied
easily and ordered rye

  the kid casually observed that
the large room housed many and
various gambling layouts most of
them receiving a good play across
the room on a raised platform a
small droop-shouldered man was
pounding from a battered piano
something which passed for music
with the boisterous crowd to spot
three-finger jack among this shift-
ing camp population would take a
little time the kid decided for he
had never seen the man and had only
a sketchy description of him he
was said to be a nondescript char-
acter of ordinary size and build
whose only oddity was that the sec-
ond finger of the left hand was cut
off at the first joint

  any easy money around this dig-
gings he asked of joe

  diamond joe could detect only
bitterness in the kids hard-bitten
face and sardonic smile not unless
youve a stand-in with ike jenkins
diamond said but if youre plenty
handy with your gun waal ike
might use you just stick around
camp a few days give the boss a
chance to look you over whats
your moniker son

  the kid thought of three-finger
jack and decided changing names
was a game two could play he
brought out his worn deck of cards
and gave them a shuffle then
with studied carelessness he cut the

deck and turned two cards face up
on the bar the ace of diamonds
and king of spades showed diamond
joe looked at the cards puzzled

  thats my moniker explained
the kid just tell ike jenkins that
ace king will bear lookin over ill
stay a few days

  you wont stay long with that
moniker said the lookout not
unless you take up residence in boot-
hill

  yeah said the kid that
spade is to bury my dead

diamond joe shook his head

he stepped to a drawer contain-
ing gambling supplies and selected a
new deck of cards which he placed
before the kid

  your cards are about worn out
he smiled still friendly try your
luck with a new deck pick another
moniker son one of the boys an-
swers to ace jackson theres no
use in you gettin killed

  the kids blue eyes brightened
thats right he grinned i reckon
i better try my luck again

  he broke the seal on the new deck
and shuffled it while diamond joe
watched narrowly and with keen in-
terest but when the kid cut and
turned up two cards they were the
same as before the ace of diamonds
and king of spades diamond joe
looked startled

  pilgrim you are slick with cards
he conceded

  yeah an slick with a gun said
the kid better tell ace jackson to
change his moniker-or leave camp
i aim to stay he pocketed the new
deck of cards tossed a coin on the
bar and walked outside to his horse

  looking out over the painted half
of a front window diamond joe
watched the kid mount and ride off
along the street a young but mighty


street  smiths western story

salty gun hand he decided and
hunting easy money

  there was a clearing amid the
pines and chincapins where a large
corral and open-faced shed served
stringtown as a livery the kid
found it and left his animal with the
hostler in charge next he dulled
i he keen edge of his hunger in a tent
eating house where he picked up
scraps of information while listening
to the other patrons converse he
knew at once that the camp was on
edge rich claims were constantly
being jumped thrifty miners who
did not gamble or spend money over
the bars were nightly being mur-
dered and robbed of their hard-won
gold gunplay was so common that
it passed with scant notice the jen-
kins gang it seemed held a death
grip on this bonanza diggings the
powder river kid set out to prowl
the camp

  the sun dropped behind high tim-
bered ridges and the sultry air of
stringtown cooled miners wearing
the mud-stained garb of their trade
thronged the street in increasing
numbers one of them an elderly
man who walked with a painful limp
attracted the kids attention the
mans hat brim was low over his
eyes a grizzled beard effectually ob-
scured his features pausing fre-
quently the limping man spoke in
low tones to other miners who
nodded as if in agreement then con-
tinued on their way this aroused
the kids interest something was
stirring

  he followed the man at a distance
soon an entirely different type of
man brushed past the kid a man
who wore expensive and spotless
garb and whose half-lidded hawk-
like eyes were fixed intently on the
movements of the one who limped
the stalkers lean sharp visage ex-
pressed the predatory cruelty and

cunning of a wolf his polished
boots took him nearer to his quarry
while his lean hands drew closer to
the butts of his thonged-down guns
suddenly his cold voice chilled the
crowded street

  tuttle he called youdamned
thief

  startled the limping man whirled
about his hand going to his gun it
was a hopeless attempt to draw and
shoot his weapon never cleared
leather the hawk-eyed gunman
blasted him down shooting with
both hands tuttles body shuddered
with the impact of smashing lead

  he gave an agonized cry jen-
kins you bloody devil youll-
a lead slug crashed through his
teeth another ripped through his
heart

  ike jenkins stood in his tracks a
moment watching the body settle in
the red dust of the street carefully
judging the temper of the startled
crowd then he turned calmly and
walked back toward the ace high
saloon while nearly fifty miners
watched him go they had wit-
nessed cold-blooded murder yet
none of them made a move a gun-
man laughed coldly and the kid was
quick to understand there were
others of the jenkins gang posted
along the street their guns were
protecting their leaders back

 laugh you damned coyote
growled an embittered miner under
his breath the jenkins gang has
just about shot its last wad in this
diggins

  the kid swung about and faced
him yeah what do you mean
by that he eyed the big miner ap-
praisingly and his thin lips twisted
in scorn

  without answering the miner spat
into the dust and turned away it
was obvious that he wanted no words
aces and eights



with anyone who wore a gun in such
a rakish manner as the kid did
other miners eyed the kid sharply
no doubt considering him one of the
jenkins gang none of them spoke
for the expression on the kids face
was not friendly he saw in these
slow-handed intimidated miners
only so much pay dirt being run
through ike jenkins sluice box and
washed clean of their gold where
was their fighting spirit he won-
dered they stood huddled like a
bunch of storm-whipped cattle the
kid turned his back on them and
moved away

the kid continued his prowl of the
camp while doves mourned in the
chincapins and nighthawks cried in
the darkening sky sight of that
gunplay had intensified the hard-
bitten expression on the kids face
it had plunged his mind into a dark
interval of morose and brooding
thought the night life of the boom-
ing camp held small interest for him
and it was yet early when he paid
an outrageous price for a room on the
second floor of a frame hotel which
was not yet completely finished but
was already open for business

  he pulled off his boots stretched
out on the narrow bunk and pre-
pared to get some needed sleep but
sleep would not come he soon dis-
covered through the flimsy parti-
tion there crept into his ears the muf-
fled sound of someone sobbing a
soul-racking outpouring of grief
all the more disturbing because
it was almost wholly suppressed it
angered the kid he tried in vain to
close his ears to the sound he com-
menced wishing he had slept out un-
der some chincapin however he
was packing a considerable roll of
money and had not wanted to run
the risk of being murdered while he
slept but now that racking sound

in the adjoining room was cutting
into his heart

  the powder river kid had long
thought his heart was hard as stone
he was still more angered to discover
it wasnt that sound of grief
slight as it was cut into his heart
quite easily he found no defense
against it sitting up in the dark-
ness he rolled a smoke waiting for
the sound to stop but it kept on
and on it drove the kid to remove
the chair from before his door and go
out into the long hallway where he
gently tried the latch at the next
door

  the door opened and the kid went
quietly inside he struck a match
and lighted a lamp on the wall face
down on the bunk lay a slender fig-
ure in overalls and brush-frayed
jacket head buried under a pillow
at first the kid thought it was a
girl he hesitated as if about to
back away then thought better of it

  snatching away the pillow he said
harshly shut up stop that fool
noise

  with a violent start the youngster
sat up shrinking back against the
wall he was dry-eyed now for the
wells from which tears flow had long
since been emptied he looked at
the kid and his quivering lips tight-
ened he became utterly silent and
motionless his grief-reddened eyes
glaring at the kid with an expression
of bitterest hatred his eyes were
light-brown well set in a handsome
face something in that face turned
the kids unreasoning anger he sat
down on a rough bench and worked
up a smoke eying the holes in his
socks the silence became a living
thing

  i couldnt sleep said the kid
and took out the new deck of cards
his skilled hands worked with them
absent-mindedly while the boy
watched and the silence built again


street  smiths western story

the kids hard-bitten expression
softened somewhat and when he
spoke again his voice had softened
too cryin dont get a man no-
where better tell me about it son

  the boy on the bunk drew a deep
unsteady breath and let go of it with
a quivering sigh youre not one of
the jenkins gang the kid shook
his head and the boy went on ike
killed my dad and i  i couldnt
even get pas gun they toted him
off and slapped me away wouldnt
even let me watch his buryin im
sorry you couldnt sleep mister
soon as i can get over these shakes
ill slip out of here i gotta kill ike
jenkins thats why i snuck up
here mister to get rid of these
shakes

  i know how you feel said the
kid ive felt that way myself
you learn you got a chore to do even
though you gotta grow up to the job
youre tuttles kid i reckon

  yeah jim tuttle my pa dis-
covered this diggings ike jenkins
drove us off and jumped our claims
he shot pa and left him for dead
but i managed to pack him back in
the hills and he come around again
pretty fair we kept to the hills
because the jenkins gang had staked
all the best claims here pa was
lucky and struck it again the mother
lode he said we got a family back
east dependin on us and pa was
determined to make good he came
here thinkin to pick some honest
miners whod help him hold that new
strike for a fair share now pas
dead

  gold never made anyone rich
said the kid you better get out of
this camp and head for your folks
back home

  jim tuttle shook his head we
hid our horses back in the chinca-
pins theres a rifle on my saddle
i aim to kill ike jenkins then ill

hold that lode you might have
caught me cryin mister but i aint
a quitter

  sure not said the kid  know
how you feel you got a chore to
do he eyed the holes in his socks
and continued to work with the
cards his thoughts taking a new
turn he wanted to help this kid

  a step came along the hall doors
softly opened and closed listening
the blue eyes of the powder river
kid narrowed a little presently the
door of the room opened and a non-
descript man in gamblers attire
coolly stepped inside the kid felt
his back hair raise like the hackles of
a dog scenting wolf the intruder
smiled and his left hand toyed with
the heavy gold watch chain strung
across his checkered vest the second
finger of that hand was short its fin-
gertip had been neatly amputated at
the first joint and the kid knew ex-
actly why that short finger offered
a decided advantage to a crooked
poker player wtith it cards could be
dealt from the bottom of the deck
without a telltale glimpse of the
working fingers knuckle

  the powder river kid knew he
was face to face with three-finger
jack the tricky tinhorn who had
killed his father but not face to
face across a poker table so the kid
grinned this your room amigo
he asked easily

  not at all sir replied the gam-
bler suavely i was hunting this
fatherless lad this camp is not un-
mindful of his sorrow over in the
ace high some of us gentlemen took
up a collection in his behalf al-
ready it amounts to over a thousand
dollars and its still growing we
will all feel honored if the lad comes
over with me so that the donation
can properly be presented to him
you understand sir

  jim tuttle blurted out a hot re-
aces and eights



fusal but the kid silenced him with
a look and said the lad is all on
edge he dont savvy how such
things go but i savvy it was
mighty kind of you gents to take up
that collection for the youngster
hell think well of you in the morn-
in after hes had some sleep ill
talk with him about it tomorrow
ill bring him over to the ace high
mister-

  the gambler smiled just ask for
ace jackson ill be looking for you
if im not around some of the boys
can find me by the way whats
your name

  the moniker is ace king said
the kid and matched the tinhorns
smile

  i take keen pleasure in making
your acquantance jackson said
you impress me as being a far-
sighted young man we have much
in common ace the tinhorns
colorless eyes turned suggestively to
jim tuttle then returned to the kid
it becomes obvious that we can
work together diamond joe speaks
well of you three-finger jack
bowed courteously and departed

  jim tuttle looked accusingly at
the kid i dont want their damned
money

  sure not jim but when you toss
a cat on its ear it always lands on
its feet well be mighty lucky to
do that i reckon was your dad
packin gold of rich quartz from that
lode

  yeah ace pa brought along
some picture rock thatd knock yore
eyes out he wanted something to
show the honest miners thatd draw
em to him look here

  the boy handed the kid a lump of
ore it did not require a trained eye
to see that the ore was the real mc-
coy for it was seamed and splotched
with yellow metal the kid viewed
it with a sardonic smile

  i thought so jim the jenkins
gang searched your dads pockets
they know he made a new strike
that talk of a thousand dollars was
just bait they aim to get their
hands on you so you can lead em
to the rich lode your dad discovered
id never do that declared the
boy

  sure you would said the kid

   	

theyd help you change your mind
and it wouldnt be pleasant the way
theyd handle you you got a kite
to fly an mighty sudden come
along jim ill get my boots on
jim tuttle followed rather uncer-
tainly events were moving too fast
for him to understand fully but he
had looked behind the kids mask
of bitterness and knew he had found
a friend the two of them left the
hotel by way of the back stairs and
without mishap gained the livery

  i was lookin to get some shut-
eye grumbled the kid to the watch-
ful hostler in charge but ike
gimme a chore to do straight off
that seemed to satisfy the hostler
and his alacrity to serve the kid
proved he was one of the jenkins
gang the kid saddled and
mounted he rode to where the boy
waited in the scrub timber nearby
and swung him up behind the two
continued on for a little ways then
the kid stepped down he split his
roll of money and tucked one half in
the boys overall pocket

  so long jim he said easily
give my bronc its head itll pick
a game trail and take you up the east
slope and over the pass keep on
headin east amigo my bronc
knows the way when you hit the
t bar z on powder river just tell
the boys that the kid sent you
theyll make you right at home no
matter who owns the spread now
but i wasnt thinkin to pull


street  smiths western story

out said jim tuttle i got me a
job to do

  skip it jim said the kid firmly
ill do yore chore along with one
of my own he slapped the bay
gelding  the rump give them
t bar z punchers a howdy from me
jim he called softly as the gelding
knowingly carried the tuttle boy
away

three-finger jack was deal-
ing at a poker table in the ace
high bar when the kifl found him a
little later that night they ex-
changed a look of mutual under-
standing as the kid settled into a
vacant chair at the table which an
unlucky miner was vacating having
dropped all the gold in his poke in
the game of draw

  the colorless eyes of the gambler
asked a question

  i left him asleep answered the
kid and bought a stack of blues
he feels pretty tough butll come
out of it

  the gambler smiled and nodded
youre mighty quick to catch on
my friend its a no-limit game with
millions in it

  the kid smiled i could use a
little easy money he replied am-
biguously i been thinkin to buy
me a ranch

  so the jenkins gang was after jim
tuttle he mused the game was
like mistletoe on the oaks a para-
sitic growth that lived on the sweat
and blood of honest men who toiled
c observed that the cards were fac-
tory marked the same as the new
deck in his pocket bought from dia-
mond joe this was a no-limit game
and the miners were betting reck-
lessly not knowing that they were
being fleeced one of the miners was
the same black-bearded giant the
kid had met in the street his name
proved to be abe benton big abe

his friends called him abe was los-
ing heavily losing temper too and
grumbling

  when it came the kids turn to
deal his skilled hands stacked the
deck after the cut he easily
slipped the lower half back to the
top again he dealt top bottom and
second cards he dealt big abe a
winning hand and smiled sardoni-
cally as the giant raked in the chips

  by thunder rumbled abe ben-
ton youve changed my luck
young feller he gave the kid a
square-toothed grin

  luck whipsawed back and forth
across the table chips passed from
three-finger jack to abe benton
other miners and the kid won a
few

 the game became faster and
wilder it drew an interested crowd
the gamblers drawer emptied of
gold dust and chips but he smiled
thinly and sent for more jenkins
came to stand at the tinhorns shoul-
der not at all pleased with the way
the game was going always before
ace jackson had been a steady win-
ner abe benton pawed his black
whiskers and chuckled with delight
his luck was running high the kid
remained cool and calm the smile
on his hard-bitten face never chang-
ing he had his way with the deck
and his trained hands escaped detec-
tion seated to the right of three-
finger jack the kid was cutting the
cards in such a way as to hamper the
gamblers tricky dealing

  a grim-visaged gunman came to
whisper softly into the ear of ike
jenkins who in turn bent forward
and whispered into the ear of three-
finger jack the gamblers face
tightened a bit he opened a new
deck of cards and gave them a rapid
shuffle he crimped the deck just a
trifle relinquished it for the cut

  the kid saw the crimp but care-
aces and eights



lessly cut to it whos short in the
ante he said

  three-finger jack glanced at the
pot then looked hard at abe benton
and said sweeten the kitty my
friend the big miner grumblingly
tossed in a chip and the tinhorn com-
menced dealing the cards but un-
noticed the kid had deftly switched
the lower half of the deck to the top
again the deal went wild from
there the betting went wild too
and everyone but the kid big abe
and three-finger jack dropped out
those three seemed to be holding
pat hands abe bet his pile and
called for a showdown spreading a
full house at kings and jacks the
tinhorn his face a shade whiter
grimly exposed a higher full aces and
eights he reached for his winnings
but suddenly the kid stayed his
hand

  just a minute he said im
still in this game with his right
hand he fanned out his cards he
was holding the joker along with four
aces

  five aces thundered big abe
and jackson has already turned up
three someone has cheated

  ill say smiled the kid nar-
rowly eying three-finger jack it
was a new deck and this card-
sharpers deal by mistake i
reckon he dealt himself the wrong
cards aces and eights is a dead
mans hand-so the boys say on
powder river a cowman died with
such cards in his hands once

  two guns hung on the tinhorns
flanks but he thrust at the table
and snatched for his hidden der-
ringer the great arms of big abe
had locked about the winnings and
held the table fast the kids cross-
hand draw was fast as the tongue of
a snake his big colt roared across
the poker table his slug ranged up-
ward through the gamblers skull be-

fore the derringer spoke three-
finger jack dropped back into his
chair then sprawled forward with
his head scattering the cards it was
over before surprised spectators had
time to fling their bodies from the
line of fire

  looking first at the dead gambler
then at the smiling kid big abe
slowly unfolded his arms waal
by cracky i reckon you win this
pot he said a little shaken

  bring it along pard said the
kid quite undisturbed if you like
well cash in at the bar and split the
winnings

  big abe grinned he took off his
huge hat and scooped chips currency
and gold into it then followed the
kid other miners crowded around
him and big abe grinned at them
spoke a low word or two making
clear to them that he was backing
his new-found pard to the limit

  ike jenkins a cluster of hard-eyed
gunmen around him had been in-
formed that jim tuttle had vanished
from the hotel ike correctly judged
that this salty pilgrim was crossing
his gang ike silently cursed dia-
mond joe for a bungling fool then
he cursed the dead gambler for an-
other fool-allowing himself to be
tricked at his own game with a
covert sign to his henchmen jenkins
strode after the big miner and the
kid determined to recover their
heavy winnings jim tuttle and the
new strike also figured in this play

at the bar the kid saw the gang
closing in two of them took
positions near the front door cutting
off escape other hard-looking desper-
adoes set themselves to the kids
right and left where they had him
hipped jenkins came in slowly the
powder river kid smiled in scorn
a prize bunch of gun-slingers the
gang must consider him pretty good


street  smith s western story

if they reckoned it would take the
whole dozen or so of them to down
him in a gun fight

  with his back to the bar the kid
braced himself against the shock of
lead he knew was coming jenkins
spoke sharply to diamond joe who
was counting the pile of chips

  dont pay off on that take joe
he snapped i saw this card slick
cheating

  diamond joe ducked low jenkins
was drawing and on all sides guns
were being snatched from leather
the kids colt was the first to go
into action

  in the front doorway a sharps rifle
boomed its black powder thunder
leading a crashing symphony of gun
fire the kid saw ike jenkins
knocked off balance and start down
fanning his hammer the powder
river kid heated his colt into a
flaming torch pouring lead into the
jenkins gang the kid felt his left
arm knocked limp and useless an-
other slug took him through a leg
whistlers were flying nine ways from
the jack the kids colt ran dry
diamond joe cocked back an arm
and hurled a bottle it clipped the
kids head and knocked him spin-
ning to the floor

  to hell with the jenkins gang
shouted big abe a smoking gun in
his fist finish the bloody devils

  sprawled there under the rolling
smoke the kid shook his head and
cleared it he saw the guns that had
spilled from jenkins lifeless hands
and he snatched up one of those
guns he peered toward the front
of the saloon under the thickening
smoke he made out a slender figure
in overalls and frayed jacket jim
tuttle was anything but a quitter
jim was down one one knee calmly
squinting over the sights of a sharps
at one of the jenkins gang the

the

sharps cut loose with a roar the
kid knew now who had spiked ike
jenkins and he swung about toward
the bar diamond joes head came
into sight and he was sighting a gun
at big abe bentons back the kid
spilled a shot that dropped diamond
joe into the discard

   suddenly it stopped the miners
had finished the rest of the jenkins
gang they could fight those slow-
handed miners once they got started
big abe picked up the kid ex-
amined his wounds then slapped him
on the back by cracky paid
well split them winnins yet they
downed yuh but youre all to the
good

   in spite of two bullet holes the
 kid was feeling pretty good a
 changed expression was on his face
 as he looked around at these hard-
 fisted miners they were giving him
 warm and friendly smiles the kid
 grinned back in kind

  jim tuttle came to his side
through the lifting smoke he was
carefully stuffing a cartridge into the
sharps waal i finished one chore
and i reckon you finished yourn
mister i tied your bronc along with
mine back in the chincs ifn you
aint too busy maybe youd help me
with that other job back in the hills

   dont you two kids be in no tar-
 nation rush said big abe benton
 kindly you aint goin no place
 without i tag along you need a
 gent about my size to look after
 you

   then plug these leaks and let s
fly our kite said the kid in big
abes ear jims got a lode to stake
and i reckon us three is equal to the
job the way i feel it wont be
healthy for no human to start both-
erin us

   not by a jugful it wont the

range savvy

by h fredric young

  sixty years before the oregon expedi-
tions and the discovery of gold in cali-
fornia pioneers from new england
shouted westward ho and the first
of the covered wagons creaked out of
ipswich massachusetts headed for the
great adventure on march   dele-
gates from eight counties met in boston
and drafted a plan made by general
benjamin tupper to explore northwest
of the ohio river

  the plan of action agreed upon in-
volved the raising of a fund of one
million dollars to be divided into one
thousand shares of one thousand dollars

each in conti-
n e n t a  land
certificates and
the purchase of
settlement land
in the western
territory con-
gress eventually
granted five
million acres of
land at two-
thirds of a dollar an acre as this was
to be paid in united states certificates
of debt which were worth about twelve
cents on the dollar the actual price of
the land was about eight or nine cents
per acre perhaps but one percent of the
present worth of that same land

  armed and equipped for their danger-
ous enterprise the emigrants gathered on
december   at the rev dr cutlers
house in ipswich and after firing a vol-
ley as a salute began their westward
track this was the first wagon train to
strike out for the west



  in western frontier times the ski or
norwegian snowshoe as it was then
called was an integral part of the equip-
ment of the stockman very few pos-
sessed web snowshoes much less the
skill to use them one reason being that

the legs of a man who rides a horse sev-
eral hours a day do not handle the clumsy
racquet easily

  a band of cattle might be trapped in

some sheltered
spot beyond
gulches and
drifts through
which a horse
could not wal-
low and in such
cases small
bales of hay
were carried to
them by means
of skis if roads and trails became
blocked the rancher waited only for the
snow to settle then on a pair of well-
tallowed skis he set out to visit neigh-
bors the post office or trading post prob-
ably at the same time enjoying the sport
very much as the ski enthusiast of today
does the only difference in the ski of
then and now was that the staff with
rings attached on which modern skiers
depend so much was unknown to ranchers

  up to a few years ago in order to
bring religion into the various inacces-
sible hamlets of cattle lands a circuit-
riding preacher visited these places

often months
and even years
elapsed between
his visits
hence arriv-
ing it was not
uncommon  for
him to hold
services for a
wife or hus-
band long dead
the word-coining cowboy in order to
avoid any confusion of identity in-
geniously nicknamed these gentlemen
sky pilots and the name stands as one
of the landmarks of the old west

saddleful of dynamite

by jim kjelgaard

  down in the corral little dust
bombs exploded under the hoofs of
the two mares as they made a wild
race around the inclosure and finally
backed into a corner but the sleek
brown gelding neck arched and
pointed ears erect braced his fore-
fee and lifted his tail a little as he
faced the girl who was approaching
him with hand outstretched

  mac williams sitting on the top
bar of the corral felt his own hands
tremble the gelding reared and a
great cloud of dust arose when it
cleared the gelding was nosing into

the pocket of the girls buckskin shirt
for the reward he knew would be his
for this bit of play acting and mac
heard chris laphams admiring
joan i think you talk horse lan-
guage

  mac said nothing then joan
deering turned her quick gaze from
chris lapham to him and smiled
macs white teeth flashed against
his lean sun-tanned jaw as he an-
swered the smile but his hand had
dropped to the corral bar and his
knuckles showed white

  he and joan deering had grown
saddleful of dynamite



up together mac remembered her
as far back as he remembered any-
thing they had ridden brooms
about the yard and after that she
had been a half-wild rugged little
tomboy sticking like a leech to the
back of the wildest pony mac had
never thought of her as a girl in
i hose days she had been like an-
other boy riding with him as they
explored the far blue hazes together
and always they had talked of
horses the wonderful horses both
would own when they grew up

  now this girl who had always been
part of his life was a woman and
mac knew that if she did not con-
tinue to be part of his life for him
there could be no life

  hut there was chris lapham who
controlled a small empire of ranches
and fifty thousand head of cattle and
horses chris was a fair man as he
understood fairness but what he
already had in the palm of his hand
mac only hoped to get

  joan deering came out of the cor-
ral mac leaped down to join her
and for a moment before chris lap-
ham came around the corral his
gray eyes met her brown ones they
had known each other a long time
and speech was not always neces-
sary between them but lately by
tacit consent they had been more
aloof from one another joan owed
him nothing and mac wanted her
to understand it she neednt do
anything she might later be sorry for

ive brought you something joan
chris lapham was saying

 brought me something her
brown eyes lighted pleasurably
what is it

  chris grinned a little jigger i
thought youd like he led the way
to his car opened the door and bent
over the back seat mac heard joan
deerings gasp of incredulous de-
ws-  a

light and for the fraction of a second
felt chris laphams eyes piercing
him mac lowered his gaze to the
present chris lapham had brought

  it was a saddle a heavy stock
saddle made of finest tooled leather
silver stars and circles decorated the
tree skirts and stirrup leathers on
one fender was a silver-inlaid picture
of a girl on a bucking horse holding
her hat hight in her right hand with
reckless abandon on the other fen-
der was simply a horse but it had
been wrought with supreme artistry
that made the horse come alive as
he stood on a little silver-tinted
hillock with his head alert

  joan deering was on her knees
the tips of her fingers daring only to
brush the silver saddle she looked
up at chris lapham her face
flushed

  chris she said haltingly i-

  it was made in london especially
for you

  he might have said especially
for me mac thought recognizing
the silver saddle for what it was a
daring gesture a bold stroke telling
joan deering that it was only the
first of many marvels that could be
hers with chris lapham and it
was a challenge to mac williams
at last the gantlet was thrown
openly

  joan deering arose her riding
skirt molded smoothly to her slim
hips and swished loosely about her
knees her buckskin shirt revealed
her slender waist a big hat hung
down her back and her tumbled
brown hair framed her excited face
mac knew that if she had designed
the saddle herself she would not
have had it different chris lapham
could read a girls thoughts and
know her dreams

  joan looked at mac and back to
chris if she kept the saddle- mac
tightened his jaw suddenly and did


street  smiths western story

not speak for a moment because he
wanted his words to flow freely and
naturally any man who could not
stand and trade punches with an-
other man admitted himself inferior
to that man and a man must never
beg for what he could not get

  joan thats as fine a piece of
leather as i ever saw he said ad-
miringly

  and he saw respect in joan deer-
ings eyes resentment and involun-
tary admiration in chris laphams

half that night mac williams
lay in his bunk his open eyes
staring into the blank unyielding
darkness that was so heavy it almost
seemed he could push it away if he
reached forth his hand and tried
and when he finally found sleep it
was troubled slumber broken by
dreams of a huge silver saddle that
had been fastened to his back and
rendered him incapable of moving
mac woke up again he struck a
match and its yellow light made a
puny effort to defeat the darkness
the alarm clock on the shelf said
two oclock

  mac got up and dressed he
started a fire in the stove and cooked
a breakfast of ham eggs and coffee
he made a light pack of coffee flour
bacon and salt wrapped it in a tar-
paulin and strapped a holstered 
around his waist he took his strong-
est lariat from its peg in the store-
room and with that in his hand went
out to the corral

  a hundred million stars were pin
points in the sky and above the dark
bowl of hills that surrounded his
ranch the sky was light the six
horses in the corral snorted when
they smelled him and milled about
mac opened the gate and went in
he dropped the lariat noose over the
head of a stringy bay with a wall
eye there were faster horses in the

corral but the stringy bay was
longer winded and had more en-
durance than any of the others

- mac drew the fighting horse to
him warmed the bit with his hands
and put on the bridle the horse
danced skittishly when mac threw
the heavy saddle on and fastened the
pack to it the rope he laid across
the saddlehorn leaving the bay
tied to a corral post mac hazed the
other five horses out they would
find range fodder while he was away
so there was no need for anybody to
be at his ranch mac mounted the
bay pitched briskly for a few min-
utes then warmed up and started
off at an easy trot through the dark-
ness

  mac rode up a stone-bottomed
gully and into timber at its head
the first light of day shot a wide
silver streak across the sky mac
turned south through the timber
and let the horse pick his own gait
and his own way through there
was no hurry

  the light of the stars began to
fade as the increasingly stronger
hand of day shoved them back to
distant hiding paces in the sky mac
touched the spurs lightly to the bays
flanks and turned him down a hill
into an aspen-covered valley they
climbed the hill on the opposite side
and mac drew up beside a natural
meadow to sit his horse waiting

  then daylight broke full and the
pouring sun made dappled shadows
on the trees and seemed to make a
golden fire of the meadow mac bent
low in the saddle his eyes fixed on
the lower end of the meadow

  a scrubby little white mare came
into the meadow and started across
it she stopped in the center and
looked back mac caught the mo-
tion of other horses following lier
seven more little white mares their
saddleful of dynamite

g

tails and manes heavy with bur-
docks came into the meadow and
dropped their heads to crop list-
lessly at the grass then mac
sighted the blue roan

perfectly formed from his
small head to his black tail the
blue roan was a living model of a
horsemans dream nobody knew
exactly how he had come here
whether he was a throwback to fine
forebears or whether he had escaped
from some wealthy ranchers private
stables he was mac thought
mostly pure arab with a dash of
some other blood

  only once in the three years the
blue roan had been on the range had
he been saddled two cowboys had
trapped him in a blind gully and
had roped and saddled him blind-
folded and still hobbled the blue
roan had been allowed to come to
his feet one of the men mounted
while the other snatched the blind-
fold and hobbles off then the sad-
dle cinches broke and the blue roan
nearly killed his rider before the
other man drove him off and back
to the hills with the bridle still on

  in some way the blue roan had
gotten rid of the bridle since then
he had been chased numerous times
but catching him was like catching
a deer he was faster than any
other horse and gave no man or
group of men another opportunity
to corner him when pursued he
took to the hills and sought the wild-
est and most unapproachable breaks
and canyons but this time mac
thought with set jaw the blue roan
would have to trail longer than he
ever had before and hide his trail
better

  mac rode into the meadow the
eight mares threw their heads up
the blue roans nostrils flared and
his eyes fixed on mac mac held the

bay to a trot the nine horses
wheeled and were gone

  they scattered the blue roan
never held his bunch together when
they were being chased mac still
held the bay to a trot before he was
through he was going to need all the
strength speed and endurance the
bay had the wild bunch came to-
gether in the gully but scattered
again when mac caught up with
them they came together a third
time in the main valley leading to
the ranches and again mac found
them

  the blue roan black mane flying
and black tail streaming behind him
broke into a gallop and drew away
from the mares he cut toward a
side valley that led back into the
hills thundered up it mac roweled
the stringy bay a white mare
squealed and her heels flashed up as
he rode past her he entered the
valley but the blue roan was not in
sight the little black marks where
his pounding hoofs had scarred the
green earth made an uneven line up
the valley mac took the trail and
followed it all day camping on it
that night

for four days mac trailed the
blue roan and in that time saw
him twice true to his habits the
horse had struck for the roughest of
the upland country and for two days
mac had ridden the stringy bay
through breaks great spruce and
pine forests and over rough rocky
country so desolate and forsaken
that it seemed unbelievable any
other creature could live there

  it was not game country though
there was some game a half dozen
times a day big-eared deer flashed
across the trail there were trees
that had been scarred and tom by
bears claws and big grouse that
waited until the horse and rider were


street  smith s western story

almost upon them then burst out on
thundering wings and at least once
a day mac saw fresh cougar sign
there would be cougars wherever
there was deer it was not a safe
country for horses mac did not
worry about the bay but the blue
roan had no protection

  a stubble of black beard itched
macs tanned face his shirt was
ripped and torn by sharp spikes of
branches and the food lie had
brought was almost gone but there
was enough game in this country so
that he need not fear starvation he
shot grouse with his pistol and re-
served five cartridges in an inner
pocket they were for shooting deer
if he got so far back that it would
take him a number of days to get
out again

  but while there was food for him
there was little forage for the horse
he rode the bay nibbled at shoots
of trees and whenever they crossed
a patch of grass that the blue roan
had not already eaten mac stopped
to let his horse graze and always
the trail of the blue roan led farther
back into the wilderness

  the roan was never more than a
few miles ahead but mac could
not shorten his lead when he found
the trail plainly marked and rode
hard the blue roan galloped to draw
away from him when he stopped
to rest or camp he found when he
rode on where the blue roan had also
stopped when because of hard or
rocky ground mac had to walk and
lead his horse the blue roan walked
ahead of him

  another day passed mac found
himself one more days travel back
in the wilderness and no closer to
the blue roan he picketed the bay
with the lasso and made his camp at
the base of a towering pine from the
foot of which a little crystal spring
bubbled his supper was a partridge

and sour-dough bread and when he
finished eating he sat with his knees
hunched under his chin watching the
fire cut the night with yellow knives
and listening to the bay as he ranged
to the end of his rope to smell out
every last bit of the sparse forage

mac often thought of the silver
saddle that had cost chris lap-
ham half as much as macs whole
ranch was worth and of joan who
had accepted it as a gift she had
known as well as mac knew what
that saddle meant had understood
that to refuse it would have been to
insult both men if mac couldnt
match the present chris had of-
fered- but he would match it
hed follow that roan devil to hell
and back hed-

  the bay horse raised his head and
snorted his hoofs thudded on the
pine needles as he galloped close to
the firelight and stood staring into
the darkness the pistol in his hand
mac stepped up beside him the
horse had smelled either a cougar or
a bear mac stroked the bays neck
talked to him soothingly when he
returned to the fire the horse
crowded close to him and stood
swishing his tail and stamping his
forefoot

  mac wrapped the tarpaulin about
him and lay down to sleep a cold
fear that had been present but latent
since hed been in this country
started up afresh the bay had
nothing to fear because it was in-
conceivable that any animal would
attack a horse while a man was near
but the blue roan was a different
proposition

  the bay still stamped near the fire
when mac fell asleep but it had wan-
dered to the end of the rope and was
lying on a small hummock when he
woke up it was still dark but not
the intense blackness of deep night
saddleful of dynamite



a gray light filtered through the
trees and it grew stronger as mac
built up the fire in these high alti-
tudes the nights were always cold

  breakfast-another partridge and
more sour-dough bread-finished
mac paced restlessly back and forth
waiting for enough light to continue
on the blue roans trail

  at last mounted and leaning from
the saddle he started he sighed
knew tremenduous relief when he
found the blue roans trail and five
miles from the place where he had
camped the horses bed in a grassy
little swale

  all day trotting or cantering
where he could walking and leading
the bay where trailing was hard
mac followed the day was a dreary
repetition of the five preceding it
just before dusk mac swung from
the bay to make camp he went for-
ward for one last look at the blue
roans trail and gasped his heart
seemed to skip a beat ten feet
beyond the place where he had
stopped a big cougar had come out
of a patch of small evergreen

  his track beside the blue roans
was plain

leaning close to the ground
mac continued on the trail
dusk became semi-night mac
struck a match and by the flicker-
ing light advanced a few more
paces then realizing the futility
of such action he turned to almost
bump into the bay the animal had
smelled the cougar and was afraid
to be alone

  mac returned to the camp site he
had selected and built a fire cou-
gars hunted by sight and hearing
more than by scent undoubtedly
this cougar had come out of the ever-
greens just after the blue roan had
gone by and had seen the horse he

was following him to get some idea
of the blue roans line of travel the
places he would pass and the spot
where he would probably bed down
if the cougar decided to hunt farther
he would go to the bedding place
and make his attack there

  but the cougar might not be hunt-
ing the blue roan mac told himself
cougars didnt hunt by running
along the trail of whatever animal
they wanted to kill they ambushed
that animal and sprang from some
high place down on it besides the
blue roan was as swift and powerful
as any horse his size could be lie
could defend himself then mac
shook his head horses had de-
feated cougars but not often

  but all he could do was sit the
night out and see what the morning
brought he told himself that his
chances of getting a rope on the roan
were only about one in forty any-
way and even if he roped him there
still remained saddling and riding
him but he had known before he
started that his chances of getting
the blue roan were small

  he rolled up in the tarpaulin and
tried to sleep but he could not
sleep again he was troubled by
visions of the silver saddle and the
tall cool girl to whom he must take
as good a present or admit defeat
finally he dozed in fitful snatches to
wake up long before daylight the
bay horse stood over him

  mac cooked and ate breakfast and
saddled the bay eagerly he led the
horse out to the last point to which
he had traced the blue roans trail
the night before and waited fretfully
there while the black curtains of
night lifted from the wilderness
when it was light enough to see he
led the bay and followed the tracks
farther

  slowly the light grew so that he
could stand erect and see the tracks


street  smiths western story

then he could follow from the sad-
dle the blue roan had gone on be-
yond his customary lead he too
must have scented the cougar mac
touched the spurs lightly to the bays
flanks and put him to a slow trot
then he rode out on a bed of almost
solid rock with only scattered trees
growing from cracks in the rock and
lost the trail there

  he swore and dropped from the
saddle to search on his hands and
knees after five minutes he found
where the rock had been scuffed by
a pointed hoof the next mark was
ten feet beyond that and took an-
other two minutes to find mac
stood erect beads of sweat dotting
his temple his shirt collar was hot
about his neck it would require
hours of painful tracking to follow
the blue roan across the rock he
might lose the trail altogether the
reins slack in his hand he stood up

  then the bay whinnied

  mac turned the bays head was
up and his ears were cocked forward
he was gazing intently across the
rock in the direction the blue roans
trail led mac followed his gaze
then he vaulted to the saddle and
dug the spurs in the bay leaped
forward

  they thundered across the rock
and were in a thin line of trees the
bay tossed his head and fought the
bit he wheeled in a little half turn
and tried to go back mac brought
his head around and raked his flanks
the bay began to pitch mac slid
from the saddle and tied the reins
to a small pine tree his eyes rolling
the bay strained backward then
from ahead came the shrill scream
of a fighting horse

  mac snatched the rope from the
saddle and gripped his gun in his
right hand as he ran on branches
whipped him the blue roan
screamed again

  a half mile from where he had
tied the bay mac broke from the
trees into a rock-studded little glade
he paused for a split second

  pitching bending twisting the
blue roan flung himself insanely
about his sleek sides were shiny
with his own blood and the cougar
that clung like a tawny strip of
shimmering satin to his back was
digging claws in deeper the horse
rolled but the cougar was on his
back when he got up the cougar
must have jumped from one of the
trees and the blue roan had carried
him this far

  mac raised his gun but he could
not shoot from here without endan-
gering the horse recklessly he ran
forward to get within five feet of the
savagely plunging horse then the
cougar saw him the beast leaped
and his tawny length made a long
arc in the air as he headed for a rock
gained it and slipped behind it mac
did not shoot he jammed the gun
back in its holster and took the lasso
in both hands

  the rope snaked out and the blue
roan was his horse

exactly thirty days after he
had taken the blue roans trail
mac williams rode out of the forest
on the wall-eyed bay he led a
magnificent blue roan that had a row
of freshly healed scars down his back
the horse made no effort to strain
on the short lead rope or to get
away when mac dismounted the
blue roan smelled him over with a
friendly muzzle

  only mac knew exactly what had
happened in the wild little upland
pasture to which he had taken the
blue roan only he could tell how
by infinite patience and tender care
he had taught the blue roan that
while man might be the bitterest
saddleful of dynamite



of enemies he could also be the kind-
est of friends and only mac knew
how finally he had persuaded the
blue roan to accept shackles in the
form of a saddle and bridle but
mac would never tell he had done
what he set out to do the rest wasnt
important

  mac stopped at his house on the
way in shaved and changed his
clothes he was hungry after living
on venison and roots for three weeks
but he didnt take time to eat he
remounted the bay and still leading
the blue roan rode down to the
deering ranch he put the blue
roans lead rope in joan deerings
hands

  ive brought you a horse he

said a horse fit to wear that silver
saddle

  he watched the blue roan arch his
neck as his soft muzzle brushed the
tips of the girls extended fingers
she took the lead rope the blue
roan danced skittishly but quieted
under her expert hand she looked
from the horse back to mac and
when she smiled it seemed to him
that all the old days had returned
that forever he and this girl would
ride their horses into the blue hazes
-together

  hes just good enough to wear
my saddle she corrected softly
the day you left i told chris lap-
ham hed better give that silver sad-
dle to somebody else

the end

buffalo wallow

    early travelers on the western prairie were at first puzzled by deep
cuts frequently found in the heavy sod far from any stream or water course
one spring a hunter stalking a small band of buffalo advanced under cover
to within a hundred yards of the group two bulls were industriously dig-
ging at the sod with their short heavy horns and throwing the loose dirt
back over their bodies when they tired of the play others took their
places in a short time a trench was started the animals were shed-
ding and since there were no tree trunks against which they might rub
off their loose hair they were making a place like all animals that shed
hair or wool the buffalo likes to roll in the dirt and the wallows were as
popular among them as the rolling place is with horses and mules

    buffalo wallows served the pioneers in many ways at times suffi-
cient water collected in them during a heavy rainfall so that a horse could
be watered they afforded ideal cover for hunters and some of them were
deep enough to afford protection from the cyclones that swept the prairie

    wallows had their dangers too as many a trail driver learned when in
riding out a stampede in the darkness he suddenly felt the front feet of
his horse give way under him even today one may find them in high
mesa country along the platte where the land has not been cultivated

  honest john colter would have
fought any man that told him so
but he was something like the old
gray mare not what he used to be
it had taken him until sundown to
finish his post-hole job on rock
mesa and ten oclock wasnt far off
by the time he finally reached the
y- corrals he was dog tired and
hungry enough to have eaten supper
with a buzzard but not too much of
either to notice a strange line-up in
the feed barn

  saddled horses four of them
there was no reason that he could
think of for the men to have left
their mounts saddled and bridled at
this time of night

  it bothered john he didnt even
take time to unsaddle his own raw-
boned bay but started immediately
for the bunkhouse as fast as his stiff
cramped old legs could walk

  the boys were still up all right
a sliver of light leaked from monk
dooleys room in the west end and
the low hum of voices indicated that
the foreman was not alone

  john pulled the latch string set-
ting his knee against the door which
opened with a squeak four men
huddled strangely in the center of
the room jerked around at johns
noisy entry like so many wolves
startled at a kill he didnt attempt
to move any closer just stood there
with his wide gaunt shoulders filling
the doorway

  whats the matter he asked
curiously

  with his white hair contrasted by
shaggy still-black eyebrows and a
black stub mustache honest john
colter didnt look like the average

broken-down old cowhand nor was
he a year ago he had been figured
one of the wealthiest ranchmen in
the county with ninety sections of
good grassland and plenty of fair-
marked stock to graze it but ev-
erything had gone in a single ca-
lamitous day all he had left now
was his reputation of honesty

  weve been waitip for you old-
timer foreman monk dooley said
a bit uneasily it seemed to john
the foreman was a big man with
the power of a pack mule inside his
flannel-clad shoulders and the hard-
headed grhnness of a bulldog show-
ing in his square chin and twisted
flat nose shut the door an get
over here closer so we wont have
to talk so loud

wondering john obeyed he
lowered his gaunt form stiffly
onto an upturned nail keg then
leaned forward chin in his cupped
hands

 you rannies he remarked
dryly look guilty as a litter of
hound pups around a cut of dropped
beef whats goin on anyhow
you knowed bruce gallop was
losin the y- tomorrow monk
dooley asked

  john nodded soberly unless
hes been able to raise seven thou-
sand dollars

  well he aint hes still two
thousand shy dooley seated op-
posite old honest john in the circle
of men leaned across toward him
we dont dare tell bruce ahead of
time he whispered but were aim-
in to rustle the rest of that money
for him tonight
sidewinders rain check



 how

  come midnight the foreman
explained briskly were headin for
town we aim to tap the bank be-
tween two thirty an three oclock
it ought to be easy theyve given
the night watchman a key to the
place an hell be the only hombre
on the streets at that hour with
his key the jobs a cinch

  johns sharp old eyes studied the
foreman intently youve got
somethin else up your sleeve he
accused him shucks this is the
first time i ever knowed you to play
nursemaid to anybody whats your
game monk-the real game

  the foremans swarthy face went
livid it looked for an instant as
though he would climb old john

if theres a lynchin
honest john colter said
take me too i was
in with those boys

  while the foreman talked honest
johns leathery jaw had dropped
giving his face an expression of un-
believing amazement you aint-
you aint serious he sputtered

  youre damn right we are the
foreman declared weve got a
heap more regard for bruce gallop
than we have for the bank


street  smiths western story

then and there but the mood
passed he forced a mirthless laugh
shrugged his mammoth shoulders

  if you think its all my doins
he said curtly just ask the rest of
the boys

  johns gaze swept the circle he
saw them all nod agreement his
eyes met those of dad carver who
had cooked for the gallop outfit
nearly fifteen years

  im in dad told him frankly
bruce gallop has been the best
boss that ever walked on two legs
an ill stick my chin out for him
any day

  me too chimed shorty plunk-
ett a squatty freckled little rider
who had grown up in the canyon
and never expected to leave i
couldnt stand to see pore ol bruce
out huntin a thirty-a-month job
next week

  thats the way i feel drawled
lanky tex rowan its a choice
between the bank an bruce gallop
im throwin in with bruce later
when he gets on his feet again we
can slip the money back where it
came from with interest

  but    but dang it sput-
tered honest john you rannies
are jumpin offn a cliff without even
lookin to see whats at the bottom
dont you know theres a thousand
bucks reward for the scalp of any
bank robber these days

  of course monk dooley said
sarcastically if youre scared to
join us we-

old john stiffened and anger
flared in his eyes one more
crack like that you loose-lipped ran-
nihan he said bleakly an ill
blow them words clean through the
back of your head

  tense quiet the foremans thick
fingers started inching down toward
his gun old john saw the move

he waited willing to let dooleys
hand reach the gun butt before
starting his own grab then hed
show him but dad carver who
was sitting next to monk dooley
intervened by linking his arm
through the foremans

  cut it out monk he warned
sharply you know plumb well
honest john aint got enough yellow
in his whole carcass to paint a mus-
tard seed

   then whv dont he throw in with
us

  maybe he will yet returned
dad let me have a try at him
he glanced across at john now
listen here you ol rooster he said
patiently it was this same bank
that once busted you flatter than a
split cigarette paper if it was me
id help steer bruce gallop out of
a similar chute an besides you
ought to be plumb tickled for a
chance like this to give the bank a
return wallop across the rump be-
lieve me i would

  youre damn right growled
monk dooley

   but old john continued to shake
his head

  monk dooley who had been
frowning impatiently suddenly
switched tactics he produced a
grin that was evidently meant to be
friendly reached across and laid his
hand on johns knee

   dont forget old-timer he said
 persuasively that bruce gallop has
 been mighty white to you while
 everybody else was layin men off
 he gave you a job an hes told me
 many a time to make your assign-
 ments easy-in fact ill likely catch
 hell in the mornin for sendin you
 up to rock mesa today another
 thing the foreman added hastily as
 old john attempted to cut in last
 month you were laid up three weeks
 with the rheumatism but bruce
sidewinders rain check



never stopped your pay for a min-
ute he needed the money himself
too you aint forgettin that are
you

  of course not john admitted
miserably

  a flicker of hope lighted dad
carvers face then youll throw
in with us he asked leaning for-
ward eagerly

  it was a tough moment for the
oldster he was going to have to re-
fuse them he knew but how could
he say it these rannies would
never understand that to honest
john colter it was one thing to be
loyal to his friends but quite an-
other to break either his word or the
law

  that very principle was responsi-
ble for his own plight now it was
a peculiar case a year ago john
colter had wanted to retire he fig-
ured on cashing out for some fifty
thousand dollars then being able to
pay off a ten-thousand-dollar mort-
gage the bank held so that he could
spend his remaining years in town
a buyer had contracted for his
stock and the deal was practically
closed when in a far corner of his
range john had discovered a calf
badly infected with the dread foot-
and-mouth disease he knew the
penalty if folks found it out hed
be forced to destroy his entire herd
and set fire to the range

  complete total ruin stared john
colter in the face but there was
one way he could save himself if
he closed the deal without saying
anything it would be the other fel-
lows loss faced with such a pros-
pect only one man in a million
would have called off the deal but
honest john colter was that man
two days later his stock having
been killed by the sheriffs orders
his grass only a black charred ex-
panse he surrendered his home to

the bank in payment of the mort-
gage

  this past year as a common cow-
hand had been mighty hard on john
colter but he had been able to grit
his way through because of his pride
and his conscience now they were
asking him to give up these

  what do you say monk doo-
ley urged impatiently would you
rather see bruce keep his home or
do you want him throwed out

  john hesitated for only an instant
longer then his head came up with
a jerk his old eyes now did not
waver as he stared from one to an-
other of the group

  theres no excuse never for a
man to break the law he declared
sternly

  then well do the job ourselves

  not if i can stop you- began
john

the bunkhouse door squeaked
suddenly open as startled as
though they were criminals already
every man lunged to his feet but
it was no sheriffs posse that had
walked in on them just a stooped
kindly faced old cowman with his
vest front open and his sleeves
rolled up he seemed mildly sur-
prised at the gathering then singled
out john colter

  im glad you got back all right
john he said smiling slightly
youre still tough enough to fight
a wild cat an give him the first bite
aint you but come on over to the
main house marys fixed you some
supper an mind you he said
shooting an angry glance at the fore-
man john gets tomorrow momin
off to lay abed as long as he pleases
come along john marys already
got your biscuits in the oven he
held the door open

  john colter hesitated once more
his eyes swept the group of silent


street  smiths western story

men he read the same question on
every face could he still refuse to
help bruce gallop his closest friend
for many years his desperate gaze
moved over to bruce as concerned
over an old cowhands getting his
supper as though his own cares
werent weighing him down old
john knew he couldnt refuse to help
bruce gallop no matter what the
cost

  count me in boys he said
huskily and followed gallop

  whatre you boys fixin to do
gallop asked him outside

  just a little poker game were
cooking up lied john

  it was a strange night by two
oclock stuffy with the thick feel
of coming rain in the air a bril-
liant moon was trying to shine but
fast-moving clouds high overhead
would one minute plunge the little
canyon into gloomy darkness the
next to dazzling light

  monk dooley led his little band
of masked men into the alley behind
the bank and there motioned them
to halt suddenly the threatened
rain materialized in a soaking
drenching downpour that lasted for
perhaps a minute only to quit as
quickly as it had begun monk took
off his hat swishing the water from
its brim then beckoning his men in
close

  its about time for the night
watchman to make the rounds he
whispered ill sneak over to yon
doorway an corral him when he
comes

  dont handle him too rough
cautioned john colter

  the foreman grunted scornfully
swinging down from the saddle he
handed the reins to shorty plunkett
to hold at the same moment a
man strolled across the alley just
ahead of them the group went

rigid not even daring to breathe
one of the horses coughed but ap-
parently the watchman did not no-
tice he disappeared from sight
monk dooley waited a few seconds
then pulled out his six-shooter and
started in stealthy pursuit

  presently the waiting group heard
a scuffle followed by sounds of a
falling body and a low moan monk
came hurrying back to them and
they saw that he was shaking his
head

  i couldnt find any keys he ex-
plained well have to break in

  maybe that wasnt the watch-
man john colter suggested it
seemed to me that he was a couple
inches taller than owl malone

  it wasnt owl dooley said
they fired him yesterday this is
some new hombre they put in owls
place

 did you have to hurt him
much

  enough so that he wont stir till
mornin the foreman said grimly
but lets get started shorty you
an the rest of the boys tackle the
front door ill see if i can break
in the rear come on

  it was dark again now but they
could hear monk dooley just ahead
of them as they rode out of the al-
ley he left them there darting off
toward the banks rear door while
the rest continued on toward the
front

  old john colter hadnt said any
more but he was doing a lot of
thinking now as the group rode
on he quietly checked his horse and
swung down from the saddle he
wanted to have a look at the injured
night watchman a man left lying
in the street with a busted head
might die before morning robbing
a bank was bad enough but mur-
der too- old johns pulse nearly
stopped at the thought
sidewinders rain check



  a crushed hat on the ground in-
dicated monk had caught up with
the watchman but the man himself
was gone as moonlight lit the
street temporarily he got down on
his knees searching the ground for
bloodstains it was impossible to
tell ifthere were any though since
everything was damp from the dash
of rain a few minutes before so he
rose again to his feet he stood
undecided

  a movement down the street drew
johns gaze a hatless figure had
darted nimbly in between two build-
ings old john sucked in his breath
the watchman hadnt been badly
hurt not when he could move like
that

  john wondered whether to go
back and help the boys or collar this
fellow to keep him from rousing the
town before they could enter the
bank he decided on the latter
course breaking into a stiff-legged
trot he hurried to the place where
the watchman had disappeared
trailing after him between the two
shadowy buildings

the sudden rattle of gunfire
jerked old john to a halt more
shots sounded coming from the
bank he whirled rushing out into
the street cursing himself for not
being there to side the y- boys

  it was a block and a half farther
on and the fight was over by the
time john reached there panting
and heaving like a foundered old
horse the sight that greeted his
eyes sickened him lanterns-a
dozen of them-had bobbed up from
all sides forming a circle of light
around shorty plunkett and tex
rowan who stood with their hands
high in the air dad carver was on
the ground wounded but giving
vent to his anger at the ambush
that had trapped them

  big sheriff dawson walked over
and grabbed shorty plunkett by the
shirt collar wheres the money
he demanded peremptorily

  hell we didnt even get inside
the place growled shorty if its
gone somebody else got there first
the sheriff whipped out a gun
he jabbed the muzzle solidly into
shortys ribs dont try to give
me that he roared i want to
know where the money is

  thats right a dozen members
of the crowd muttered almost in
unison make em come clean or
well string the whole bunch up
john colter pushed through the
ring into the center of light if
theres any lynchin done around
here he said take me too im
with these boys but im backin
what shorty said we never even
got inside the place

  a murmur of surprise rippled
through the crowd there wasnt a
more respected man in the county
than honest john colter and his
admission now that he was con-
nected with a band which had in-
tended robbing the bank jolted them
to the heels

  sheriff dawson was the first to
find words in the name of thun-
der john what got you mixed up
in this

  there was an ominous hush
then

   answer that

  everybody turned the words
had come from the outer fringe of
light and now a big set of shoul-
ders squeezed into view at sight
of monk dooley old johns lower
jaw sagged in amazement he noted
further that the foreman wasnt a
captive like the rest of them

  monk dooley a gloating smile on
his face swaggered to the near cen-
ter he pointed an accusing finger
at john colter


street  smiths western story

  not all of you know it he said
in a loud voice but honest john
here has carried a grudge against
the bank since they foreclosed on
his place so hes been plannin for
a solid year to get a bunch together
an rol-

  why you lyin polecat john
broke in hotly it was you that
framed this aint that right boys
he turned to the equally astonished
y- captives they nodded em-
phatically ive smelled trouble
right from the start john went on
but monk was a little too smooth
now im beginnin to savvy it
wasnt his wantin to help bruce
gallop that lays behind this its
the reward money-a thousand dol-
lars on each of our heads as bank
robbers monk argued us into it
an then tipped you folks off to am-
bush us so he could collect-
monk dooleys scornful laugh cut
through johns words he threw a
knowing wink at the sheriff
ninety-nine bandits in a hundred
he sneered claim they aint guilty
are you gonna swallow that

  i dont know muttered daw-
son after all honest john colter
aint a man that would lie-

  but this is different sheriff cut
in a hat less red-bearded man whom
john immediately recognized as the
night watchman from what i
gather the bank took colters place
away from him a year ago you
know how an old cow mopes around
after losin a calf well no matter
how honest he used to be id say
hes changed

  thats right muttered a by-
stander

  sure another seconded hes
hid that bank loot some place lets
sweat it out of him

  old john whirled savagely on the
man if that moneys gone he
flared somebody else-

  its sure-enough gone another
man broke in

  the sheriff laid a strong set of fin-
gers on johns arm jerking him off
balance you come with me he
said crisply

wait john yanked himself
loose his eyes fairly spurting
flame youre lettin the real bank
robbers go free he charged hotly

 who do you mean-dad carver
an shorty

  no thundered old john its
as plain now as the wart on your
aunt sallys wooden leg this new
night watchman with his key
tapped the bank before we ever rode
into town he an monk dooley
are in this thing together no won-
der he passed by us in the alley
without lookin an no wonder he
got away so fast after monk re-
ported bustin him across the head
shucks-he wasnt no more hurt
than me the whole thing was a
frame-up

 you mean-

  i mean old john went on sav-
agely that this pair of oilv-tongued
hellions stands to win plenty if you
dont wake up besides collectin
four thousand dollars reward money
on me an the boys theyve proba-
bly got that bank loot salted away
too i tell you monk dooley
framed this whole thing he rode
into town with us himself an then
when-

  again the foremans sneering
laugh interrupted i figure you
gents are too smart to be fooled by
any such yarn he said to the
group but if any of you do figure
that i came in with these outlaws
i can prove it aint so

  that wont be necessary monk
sheriff dawson assured him we
dont doubt you in fact the
county owes you plenty for-
sidewinders rain check



  let monk tell us where hes
been old john broke in sharply
if hes so innocent it wont hurt
him

  thats right one of the men in
the crowd muttered

  sure if monk offers to prove
he wasnt with the gang suggested
another let him go ahead therell
be time enough afterward to settle
with the rest of these coyotes-if
they dont produce the money

  the sheriff hesitated momen-
tarily then glanced toward monk
all right he said where were
you when john an his bunch rode
into town

  from ten thirty until just now

i	was over there inside that empty
water barrel monk lied persua-
sively i didnt know just how
soon these four hombres would
strike town so i tied my horse an
hid early to keep watch on the bank

  thats gospel truth the night
watchman promptly seconded him
every time i made the rounds
monk was right there on guard it
was- a near explosion from john
colter cut him short

  youre the biggest two liars that
ever fouled good air john charged
hotly an whats more i can
prove it

  prove what asked the sheriff
i can prove old john declared
that monk dooley was in the sad-
dle with the rest of us when we rode
into town at two oclock an if
youre fair minded at all youll give
me the chance

  thats right a murmur came
from the crowd honest john is
entitled to a chance

  then hurry the sheriff growled
where is this proof

  do you gents remember a heavy
dash of rain about fifteen minutes
ago john asked as several nod-
ded he went on well we were

just enterin town it soaked us
plenty

  whats that got to do with
monk dooley

  go look at his horse an saddle
john invited them youll find
theyre both still wet-except for
the seat of his saddle that will
be dry that proves monk was rid-
in it when the rain hit

  evidence like that pointed out
monk dooley wont get you very
far youre too smart to swallow
that aint you sheriff

  the officer scratched his head
of course he said slowly if your
saddle seat really is dry an the rest
is wet it would look bad for-
it wouldnt prove a damn thing
monk dooley insisted nervously

  sure of his hunch now john col-
ter turned to the sheriff an inno-
cent man he surmised wouldnt
be afraid to let us look at his sad-
dle

  thats right agreed several in
the crowd

  the sheriff nodded to dooley
come along monk he said just
to satisfy folks well have a look
monk dooley started to hold
back but the night watchman
walked over and linked arms with
him

  sure he said readily me an
monk aint afraid of any honest evi-
dence

old john saw the pair swap
glances and saw the watch mail
wink knowingly at monk then
monk also began to grin it both-
ered john momentarily but he was
still too sure of his ground to be
much concerned with the sheriff
at his side he led the way into the
alley turning to where monks big
sorrel was hitched to a tree stump
a few of the group had stayed to
guard the y- cowboys but several
si

street  smiths western story

others had followed with lanterns
john colter asked for one then
hoisted it above his head for a look
at the saddle confident that a sin-
gle quick glance would be proof
enough

  but he was wrong the saddle
seat and all was as wet as though
it had been soaked overnight in a
tub of water

  the sheriff grunted sourly i
guess this clears monk he ob-
served its a cinch nobody was
ridin this saddle when the rain
struck

 monk dooley who had been
strangely silent now broke out with
a gloating laugh i told you he
sneered whirling on john colter
he asked well have you got any
more proof

  john gulped for words but found
none his gaunt old shoulders had
sagged wearily forward ten years
heaped onto his age his eyes de-
jected and glassy-looking now
stayed fixed on the wet leather sad-
dle and the pair of full worn bags
draped on either side of the pommel

  a hand clutched his shoulder
come along the sheriff said
coldly im takin you to jail

  all right john agreed wearily
he sucked in a deep breath and
started to turn around then he
thought of something quick as a
streak his eyes again showed fire

  look he cried excitedly the
missin money

 what do you mean sheriff
dawson demanded

  look inside them saddlebags
john directed feverishly its all
soaked through my thick head now
while monk was preparin the am-
bush at the front of the bank his
accomplice sneaked around here an
swapped saddles this ones been
waitin out in the rain but he had

the

 it packed with the money an all
 ready to go ill bet- hey

   he spun around just in time to
 nuike a wild grab for monk dooley
 the foreman was trying frantically
 to break from the crowd he would
 have made it too if old johns claw-
 ing fingers hadnt caught the back
 of his shirt he fought to get loose
 but john held on suddenly dooley
 snatched out his gun whipped the
 muzzle around and jerked a quick
 shot almost in johns face

   scorching lead seared johns tem-
 ple but the old-timer clung like a
 leech dooley tried to shoot again
 a desperate twisting jerk threw him
 off balance however and john daz-
 edly managed to trip him to his
 knees john let go with his left
 hand smashed the other a raking
 blow across the mouth dooley
 promptly countered with a clubbed
 wallop from his pistol it knocked
 john away but he dived back at
 dooley with a fury that sent the
 foreman scooting forward on his
 face before he could get up a
 dozen bystanders had leaped in to
 hold him helpless others had taken
 charge of the watchman

  friendly arms helped old john
 colter to his feet and he was daz-
 edly conscious that the sheriff was
 pumping his hand

  im sure glad to admit i was
 mistaken the officer said warmly
 an for trappin two bank robbers
 against plenty of odds ill see to it
 that the county pays you a couple
 of thousand dollars the first thing
 tomorrow mornin i reckon you
 can most retire on that old-timer

   two thousand dollars muttered
 honest john colter his tired old
 face broke into a grin why thats
 enough to clear bruce gallops place
 -an do it legal he chuckled hap-
 pily

remember this tully
taw ringo said ill ride
you down and make you pay
if it takes me a lifetime

whiplash for

a gun rucko

by h fredric young

 there was no fear in taw ringos
tanned face and only hard anger
and contempt in his eyes lay that
lash to me once tully he said with
deadly earnestness and youll pay
a devils ransom ill collect if i
have to crawl on my belly like a
snake through a prairie fire

 the moon was coming up filling
the raw pits and crooked fissures of
the mustangs with silver glow it
made pasty-white the faces of the
score of block g punchers who
formed a horseshoe around the base

 ws-b

of the cottonwood it seemed to
etch deeper the stern almost savage
lines on the face of old tully gerault
and its lifting rays bounced back
from the defiant blue fires in taw
ringos young eyes

  taw ringo was lashed with his
back to a cottonwood tree his
hard-muscled brown body had been
stripped to the waist and the hard-
bitten old man who owned the
block g stood before him with a
quirt in his hand

  taws muscles were strained but


street  smiths western story

he made no struggle against the
hemp lariat that held him there
was laughing contempt in his eyes
as he looked first at gerault then
down at the thonged quirt

  go ahead young ringo taunted
contemptuously go ahead youll
collect yore pay farther up the
crick

  tully geraults seamed face split
in a grin of derision i been threat-
ened all my life ringo he said
and threats never did spook me i
could do worse than im gonna do-i
could string you up but i swore
the next thief i caught using his
owlhoot iron on my range id lash
him and send him back to his kind-
and now i aim to do it

 then go ahead taw said
bleakly do it youre wastin
good time my time and yores the
quicker you git it done the sooner
ill start to collect but remember
what im telling yo tully you got
the wrong hombre i aint a thief

  mebbe i shouldnt hold too much
agin you said gerault you got
your old mans black blood in your
heart

  leave jed out of this taw said
thinly

  i slapped the cayuse from under
jed when we hung him gerault
continued relentlessly we caught
him dead wood just like we caught
you standing there with a hog-
tied calf at your feet and a hot iron
in the fire trouble was we didnt
catch jed until hed stolen several
hundred head of my cattle i dont
think youve gotten away with
many i seen a few calves hair-
branded of late so i been having
you trailed im doing this to warn
your kind go an tell them you was
whip-lashed by tully gerault go
to ringo roost and tell carp peters
if he ever rides out of hiding ill do
the same to him an then hang him

liighern a crows roost and tell em
id hang you now but i know i can
catch you again sometime and ill
wait till then to hang you

  taw ringo only laughed is that
palaver part of the lashing he
inquired mockingly when i die
itll be my way tully not yores
an im tellin you again i didnt
hogtie that calf

  your story dont hold water the
grim-faced cowman said savagely
you claim you rode up and scared
an hombre away ill admit there
wasnt a brand on the calf yet-i
reckon id be hanging you now if
there had been-but if my boys had
just waited five minutes longer
theyd a caught you in the act if
you are such a law-abiding citizen
as you claim why didnt you catch
the hombre

  i wouldnt care if rustlers stole
you blind said taw i know what
happened and that suits me if id
been rustlin yore punchers would
never have tied me without a fight

there was a shuffling of feet
amidst the black g hands and
some went so far as to lift their
brows punch back their stetsons
and nod to each other there w-is
logic in taw ringos words all right
and there was no guilt written across
the bronze of his face only bitter
defiance and a laughing contempt
but then he was the son of jed
ringo and what was more likely
than that jeds mean blood had
cropped out in his lone offspring

  the moon was lifting higher
bringing awing hordes of screaming
night hawks sending its revealing
waves deeper along the jagged ter-
rain splashing deeper shafts of sil-
ver along the face of tully gerault
the lines in that face attested to
the cowmans two-fisted fight for su-
premacy in the mustangs a two-
whiplash for a gun bucko



fisted fight that carried him often to
his back but ever forward over the
long years and that was enough to
satisfy tully gerault a savage hulk
of a man whose guns had never
slowed or shown mercy to an en-
emy and now before him stood
the offspring of the man who had
been his worst enemy and being
of ringo stock taw knew he could
expect no mercy he didnt ask for
any

  ill use a rope on your neck next
time i find you on block g land
growled gerault if you want my
advice dig up your old mans booty
and hit the long trail you know
where its cached theres thousands
of dollars he hid from his thievin and
marauding dig it up and git

  taw ringo laughed i aint ask-
in yore advice tully mebbe i
know where jed hid his money if i
do im the only hombre that does
but whats wrong with yore nerve
tully-ou aint crawfishin on that
quirt lay it on and lay it on
hard because i want to remember
it a long time i want to be able
to count each drop of blood on my
chest-and that many drops will be
yore pay

  ill draw blood ringo gerault
whispered hoarsely and his great
arm rose and fell long lean strips
of buckskin made loud explosions
against taut skin but taw ringo
never flinched

 twenty-five times geraults
brawny arm rose and fell and sweat
oozed from his face making it a
gleaming mask that shone with dull
and cruel radiance the sound of
whipped flesh sung a high song that
penetrated far up the pine-choked
slopes of the mustangs taw gave
no indication of the hot fire that
must have been ripping into the
heart of his chest muscles and at last
gerault stepped back the quirt

left his fingers as if it had suddenly
grown white hot and hit the dust at
his feet

  untie him gerault panted

  two punchers leaped forward and
dropped the ropes around taw
ringos shabby boots he stood
there a moment his eyes measuring
those of gerault

  beat it ordered the cowman
take vour old mans booty and
git

  but a full minute passed before
ringo moved then he took one
swift step toward gerault yore
old tully or id tear you limb from
limb he spoke in a low tension-
filled voice but youll pay arid
dont forget that

  then he moved through a parting
lane of block g riders leaped to his
horse and vanished into the night
the tattoo of his horse growing
fainter and fainter and finally dying
while the echoes lingered like some
last hushed warning

  as if mesmerized every block g
man listened until the hoofbeats
died away it was some moments
before they discovered the new-
comer in their midst

  gramp what are you doing

  tully gerault whirled tad
he gasped what you doing out
at this hour anger vanished from
his eyes as he gazed at this seven-
year-old boy who seemed to hold no
fear night or day of the rangeland
tad whose mother was dead these
seven years and whose father had
fallen a victim to one of the owl-
hooters from ringo roost was the
very cornerstone of tully geraults
kingdom

  you whipped a man tad said
accusingly

  its part of this kind of life
tad his grandfather explained
you run along home and dont
ever come out at night again


street  smiths western story

taw ringo rode with fury-
charged recklessness through the
night toward the shack he called
home a lopsided log cabin on free
land long since deserted by some
aspiring squatter rage and shame
burned in his heart

  he had been playing a game with
that little one-room gee-gaw place
a game of dreams known only to him-
self and ironically enough to little
tad gerault who often sneaked
away from his grandfathers domain
to while away happy hours with taw
ringo they called this tumble-
down structure the running r for
taw dreamed of a spread to call his
own bought with honesty and hard
sweat and smashing knuckles if
need be

  but his mind was made up the
instant that whiplash seared into his
flesh he knew what he was going to
do he had tried to live down the
name of jed ringo tried to prove
to people that an outlaws offspring
could be a decent citizen he had
tried all that and now he was
through tully gerault had branded
him an outlaw and hed be one hed
surpass the misdeeds of jed ringo
so completely that people would re-
call his father with a forgiving sigh
and he had the money to hire gun
hawks by the dozen it had been a
temptation knowing that twenty-
five thousand dollars was his for the
digging all these years since his
fathers death he had been taunted
by that money-enough to set up a
ranch equaling that of his dreams
but he had forswore ever touching
that money for personal use he had
wanted a spread built on honesty
sweat and skinned knuckles well
he was through with such dreams

  home again taw realized he was
hungry he warmed some beans on
the stove and made some coffee
when he had satisfied his hunger he

heated water and bathed his chest
as he swiped away clots of drying
blood he tried to count the livid
marks but gave up when rage blazed
up in him again

  next morning he was out on the
trail early he headed for a distant
peak that boe his fathers name-
and his own ne thought savagely-
ringo roost he could see the dim
outline of the peak in one of its
hidden canyons he knew a nest
of renegades had their hide-out
there he could hire as many guns
as he needed he spurred on

  he laughed aloud at the irony
that had brought all this about a
twist of fate as vicious as a rattler
that he had fought against for years
tully gerault was to blame for it all
tully had thrown jeering remarks at
him every time they met had
taunted him tormented him about
trying to pass himself off as an hon-
est citizen tully gerault would pay
-pay with his most sacred pos-
session the undisputed power of the
mustangs it would send the old
man to his knees crushed quiver-
ing begging for mercy

  taw knew from range gossip that
the present year had been disastrous
for the block g outfit knew that
tully geraults salvation lay in the
fact that recent heavy rains had
filled his tanks and reservoirs but
at the moment gerault could not
stand a hard blow below the belt
anything that would require hard
cash and a lot of it would send the
block g to its knees for the count
for instance a blasted dam or the
loss of a couple thousand head of
stocky yearlings

  skirting the lower realms of the
mustangs taw ringo suddenly
stopped his horse there on the
trail ahead was the answer to his
promise of revenge if he wanted to
take it tad gerault was gouging
whiplash for a gun bucko



his small pony along a brush-walled
trail taw swerved his horse and
met the youngster

  howdy tad said taw smiling
crookedly where you headed so
early

  the boy looked startled then a
quick smile lighted his face

  oh you frightened me taw
you see i was riding over to your
cabin to see you and here you are
his boyish laughter rang like a bell
through the pine-clad slopes

  taw swallowed surprise lingering
long on his face but he said gruffly
what you riding to my place for
tullyd skin you was he to know
it

  sure i know that said the lad
and he cast a backward glance over
his shoulder but i have been com-
ing here for a year and he aint
caught me yet he asked me the
other day who taught me to spin a
rope but i wouldnt tell him thats
what you said for me to do

  sure taw said brusquely sure
but you run along now i got busi-
ness on hand he seemed to forget
that here was the means of revenge
within reach of his fingers

  i got to hurry back taw i   

i	just wanted to tell you that i think
youre honest and that grainp was
wrong in whipping you fm sorry

  taw gritted his teeth ground
them until they ached all right
youre sorry his voice was harsh
now run along

  with a hurt look in his eyes the
lad turned his pony and rode away
taws eyes followed him for a mo-
ment and he swallowed again then
he jabbed his spurs and headed up-
slope

taw ringo rode into a world of
jagged peaks and yawning
chasms higher and higher toward a
bidden valley there was one door

to that valley and one door only
but taw knew where the opening lay
he rode through it unchallenged a
high-walled knife-cut pass and en-
tered upon a flat arrow-shaped area
of land comprising about a thousand
acres it was completely walled in
with staggering slabs of upright
granite taw headed straight for
a group of log huts he could see
in the distance

  it was nearing sundown and the
valley was already growing half dark
as taw dismounted before a large
cabin set apart from the rest he
recalled this cabin vividly for it had
been the home of jed ringo now
however it was occupied by an out-
law named carp peters who had
been second in command to jed

 as taw dismounted a man
emerged from the door of the place
and walked toward him he was a
tall man and the drawing shadows
distorted his heavy figure until he
looked amazingly broad he had a
short neck bullet-shaped head and
small suspicious eyes his arms
thick and hairy flapped loosely at
his sides and his flat features
seemed continually wrapped in a
snarl this man taw knew would
be apache ranee

  ranee tilted his head forward
resting his scarred chin on his bar-
rel chest who in blazes are yuh
he demanded

  im taw ringo and i want to
see carp

  ringo huh the giant drawled
what you want yuh think to
take jeds boots over skeedaddle
if yuh do ringo im it when carp
is gone besides i heard yuh was
too good to mix with yore paps
friends if yuh think-

  taw turned and strode into the
cabin aware that the giant ranee
was at his heels carp peters was
alone in the large littered room


street  smith s western story

carp was small withered like an
aging hawk that had a cracked voice
but deadly talons hed written
grim history in blood and seemed
to be gloating over it as he sat at
the table turning a bottle of whiskey
in his yellowed fingers his small
shrewd eyes lifted to taw studying
the youth at first without a sign of
recognition finally his eyes gleamed
and he said

  taw ringo whats up you
coinin here you scoutin for the
law

  no im not taw said curtly
but im scoutin gun hands how
many you got here for rent

  carp peters yawned and poured
himself a drink

  so the saints come home he
taunted well make track out o
here taw i know youre lyin
taw smiled bleakly and stood his
ground i could have brought the
law here if id wanted to he re-
minded i mean what i said-
the boss says git

the voice came from behind taw
a snarling reminder from apache
ranee taw spun round quickly
the giants huge arms stabbed out
at him blunt fingers clutching at
his jumper taw struck and he
struck hard and quick a short right
hook that cracked against ranees
cheekbone spinning the big hombre
half away a choking roar filled
the room ranee whirled with amaz-
ing speed for his size hunkered his
shoulders and began charging carp
peters leaped to his feet

  pull in your neck apache he
ordered leave the kid alone
maybe hes right he could have
brought the law along with him
ranee was still snarling but the
gun that had flashed into peters
hand cowed him he straightened
and turned toward the door

  ill kill you for that ringo he
threw over his big shoulder and
it wont be long

  alone with peters taw propped
himself on the edge of the table

  now whats all this talk youre
makin taw the owlhooter asked
calmly

  i said i want to hire some guns
taw reminded he opened his shirt
showing the lash welts to peters
tully gerault done that i aim to
break him in two

  carp peters chuckled his lids
drooped like those of a drowsy cata-
mount i been up to that idea ever
since he hung jed i got three men
down there right now on his spread
and if they get what they went after
tullys a broke gringo

  taws lips tightened wrhats it
about he asked

mebbe ill tell you-later mebbe
you wont have to break tully in
two i think i done got him broke
what about the gunhands i want
to hire asked taw

  come back in two days said
carp mysteriously if my plan
dont work ill throw in with you
well work together

  not at all satisfied with this an-
swer taw nevertheless had to accept
it he left saying he would be back
in two days as he rode away he
saw apache ranee hanging back in
the deep dusk watching him

the next evening as he sat in his
cabin eating a tasteless meal
taw heard the drum of approaching
hoofs a horseman was speeding
across the grassy flat punishing his
horse cruelly

  when taw finally recognized the
rider he stepped over and grabbed
his gun belt from a wall peg throw-
ing it around his waist

  tully gerault leaped from his
horse and ran to the door he

gun in taws middle youll come
or ill put daylight through you
he rasped

  taw only laughed go ahead
tully why dont you put daylight
through me

  their eyes met locked fiercely
then the gun sagged in tullys hand
the boss of the range was whipped-
like a jellow cur wild fierce tri-
umph was rioting through taw here
was the man he wanted to break-
broken

  yo dont dare shoot tully he
taunted im yore last chance-
and im telling yo to go to blazes
why should i help yo

  all the iron went out of gerault
the corners of his mouth sagged and
his eyes went dead and a pained
look of defeat showed on his face

  no he said wearily i cant
shoot you i came here hoping id
been wrong about you thought
maybe you was right that you really
wanted to go straight but i was
wrong youre rotten rotten to the
core

  shoulders suddenly drooping
tully gerault turned and strode to-
ward his horse slowly he lifted
himself a-saddle and rode away the
slow beat of his horses hoofs echo-
ing with leaden intensity

  as taw watched the fury in him
slowly subsided impulsively he took
a forward step then drew back a
terrible conflict raged inside him and
he tried to feed it with thoughts of
hatred he glanced down at the
red marks on his chest and his
fingers touched them gently then
as if he had no control over his own
actions he moved to the door and
shouted

tully gerault stopped

turned something jerking at his
lips taw bolted out to the corral
saddled and mounted and rode

alongside the old man their eyes
met and held an instant then taw
grunted and jerked his head toward
the mountains he rode that way
and tully followed

  the moon came out painting the
pine-choked slopes a frothy white
splashing like phantom waves along
the rugged rocks and still thej rode
on and on tullys eyes were half
closed and he kept his lips sealed
nor had the younger man spoken a
single word it was midnight when
taw halted

  dismounting he warned gerault
to keep watch then he strode off
into the underbrush came to a small
rock-crested cave and crawled in
five minutes later his nails grimy
with fresh clay taw ringo handed
tully a huge leather case

  theres about twenty-five thou-
sand in greenbacks there he said
i always intended giving it back to
you some day

  joy leaped into tully geraults
eyes his lips parted

  i dont want any thanks taw
said harshly but im gonna de-
liver that money myself lets go

 near daybreak they reached
block g headquarters men were
already astir hitting the trail while
others were dragging in weary after
a nights search for ringo roost
they bunched around gerault and
taw

  boys said tully in a trembling
voice i got the money taw lent
it to me and lies ramroddin the
affair from here on

  eyes flashed to the young man
eyes filled with amazement and new
hope

  tully says this money is to be
delivered to a hombre who will be
in shotgun gulch at noon to-day
taw said abruptly i want every
man here to go to the gulch and hide
in the south end crawl  yore
whiplash for a gun bucko



bellies for five miles if you have to
but dont be seen is that straight
he glanced around at the nodding
heads quickly estimating the man
strength aj twelve or thirteen he
felt a dull foreboding that the deliv-
ery of this money would not assure
the return of tad gerault he knew
the way of carp peters and did not
trust the outlaw an inch

  you better get started now
taw added ill ride into the gulch
at noon and meet this hombre but
i dont want a shot fired until some-
thing starts from the other side

  the other side asked a waddy
what you mean ringo

  just what i said taw said
shortly

taw waited unconscious of the
noonday heat of shotgun gulch
just when the sun was directly over-
head apache ranee a rifle across
his lap came riding in on a tough
big dun stallion ranees face
bloated with anger when he saw
who was waiting for him

  wheres the kid taw de-
manded

  wheres the money snarled
ranee

  taw opened the top of the leather
bag and the owlhooters eyes
widened with greed as he saw the
packets of green money inside his
blunt paw shot out but taw jerked
back

  wait a minute taw warned

  yuhll git the kid back ranee
spat out

  taw let his glance stray back
amidst the oak trees hugging the
gulch floor his sharp eyes detected
the tip of a black stetson but his
expression did not change suddenly
he handed the sack to apache the
big man hugged it against his body

  you see the kid gets safe to the

ranch apache taw said mildly
you see to that and dont forget

   he turned gouged his horse lightly
in the flanks apache ranee a lit-
tle puzzled sat gaping at taws back
then glanced down at the bag poked
his fingers inside and licked his
cracked lips then his laugh-a sig-
nal that taw awaited-sounded loud
and callous

  taw ringo suddenly pulled in his
mustang dropping to one side in-
dian fashion just as two slugs
chopped at his hat crown gunfire
broke loose on all sides in a split sec-
onds time and suddenly taw could
hear pounding hoofs bearing down
on him he flung up his gun too
late for apache ranee was already
upon him ramming his horse with
the big dun stallion taw felt him-
self spinning through the air he lost
all control of arms and legs once
twice during that spin he heard the
report of apaches gun and felt the
staggering power of slugs shattering
their way through flesh and bone
when he hit the ground he hit in a
limp heap

  coming to-he didnt know how
much later-the roar of winchesters
and colts dinned in his ears hoofs
were knifing the air over his head
and he had a drugged feeling which
made movement almost impossible
he began clawing the dirt with his
fingers and finally rose to his knees
he felt his six-gun on the ground be-
neath one knee and grabbing it
staggered to his feet

dimly taw saw a horse charg-
ing down on him he ducked
to one side and saw the hulk of
apache ranee lean down taw
yanked on the trigger missed but
ranees horse stumbled in a dog hole
and threw its rider end over end
the giant hit like a huge ball roll-
ing over and over but miraculously
street  smiths western story

coming to a halt on his feet in-
stantly he roared and charged

  taw dizzy and weak saw two or
three men where there should have
been one he saw forked tongues of
flame dancing before his eyes and
felt the jerk of lead as it passed
through his clothes his mind was
playing tricks on him for he was
sure that apache ranee was twins
or perhaps triplets so as a drunken
man might do he fired at each of the
figures in turn

  sound filled the air a hoarse fatal
screeching followed by several
choked coughs and then something
terrifically heavy slid against his
legs knocking him back he lay
there struggling until finally he
gained his feet as in a daze he
pointed his gun at the figure sprawled
at his feet but he didnt pull trig-
ger because he suddenly realized
that apache ranee was dead

  taw kept shaking his head trying
to jar loose the cobwebs that af-
fected his vision he thought that
sounds of the battle were dimming
he was still doing that when a group
of punchers thundered up and dis-
mounted taw lifted his gun it
wavered and somebody shouted a
warningthen taw felt the dead click
in his hand somebody laughed-
the laugh had a friendly sound-and
taw ringo at last saw clearly the
group of block g riders at his front

the

 taw counted and knew some were
 missing several were bleeding from
 open wounds but they seemed happy
 about something then taw saw
 tully gerault and tad moving to-
 ward him

   we got tad said an exultant
 voice but we had a hard time
 finding him thought youd been
 killed

   taw recognized the voice as tully
 geraults taw stood there slam-
 ming his open hand against his head
 clearing it some

   good he mumbled im glad
 tads all right well so long
 wait a minute boomed tullys
 hearty voice you ramrodded the
 act before ringo but this time its
 mine tad told me all about the
 ranch you and him called the run-
 ning r well we found the money
 where ranee dropped it im beg-
 gin you again but in a different way
 this time taw- heres the money
 take it itll set up that running r
 in fine fashion and i need a neigh-
 bor on that side of my spread-a
 man i can trust

   taw turned to face the cowman
 staring at him as though his words
 were beyond credulity then his
 glance drifted to tads jubilant face

   pinch me kid he said huskily
 i want to be sure this aint still a
 dream

  our readers seem to become more
and more active in sports as time
goes on in recent months we have
received a surprising amount of in-
quiries concerning firearms for sport-
ing purposes and this interest is
growing

  one of the most frequent of these
inquiries concerns the model 
enfield army rifle and its possibili-
ties for conversion to a good hunt-
ing rifle this particular rifle is
available to any american citizen
who is a member in good standing of
the national rifle association dues
in the n r a are only three dollars
per year and the enfield is sold to
n r a members simply because
it is war surplus not because the
government considers the gun use-
less

  heres the story behind the en-
field rifle back along in  the
allies required large quantities of

guns and
gunners

by phil sharpe

arms and ammunition their own
factories were loaded to capacity so
accordingly contracts were being
actively filled in the united states
by our own commercial gun makers
they were producing the british en-
field rifle in enormous quantities for
england of course this gun known
as the model  enfield was cham-
bered for the british  service
cartridge

  when the united states entered
the war in  it was totally un-
equipped to fight only a small
quantity of rifles were available to
take care of the rapidly mobilizing
united states army the service
springfield known as the model 
had been built in only two factories


street  smiths western story

-springfield armory at springfield
massachusetts and rock island ar-
senal at rock island illinois it
was being turned out in such small
quantities that the capacity of these
plants would not permit us to pro-
duce enough rifles to take care of
the increasing number of soldiers

  to ask any factory to produce a
new rifle is a rather complicated job
thousand of dies jigs special
gauges and other small tools would
have to be made before the first gun
could be produced this would take
many long months of effort uncle
sam looked at all available guns and
decided that the enfield would be
the best bet

  accordingly we stopped manufac-
ture of the british enfield for eng-
land and altered it slightly to handle
the regular - army cartridge
factories were already tooled up to
produce this gun and the army took
the entire production the altered
 enfield became our model


  the british enfield had not been
standardized so that parts were read-
ily interchangeable uncle sam
changed all of that after we had
standardized the enfield the assem-
bly record was  rifles a day while
skilled assemblers in the various
plants average  rifles a day per
man

  the production of enfield rifles
for the duration of the war was
 the british government
had been paying  each for these
rifles in the enormous quantities they
were taking them standardization
by our methods of manufacture

brought the cost down to the united
states to approximately  each
therefore the rifle that you can buy
from uncle sam actually costs him
 and you can acquire it for one-
half that amount of money

  uncle sam still has considerably
more than a million of these rifles
stored away thats the reason he
can afford to spare a few of them
to shooters of the united states
the price to members of the n r a
its  for a new gun or  for
a used gun used guns are service-
able but it is recommended that you
plan to buy a new gun

  of course this is a military rifle
and if you want to make a neat
sporting arm out of it it requires
some home gunsmithing the barrel
is twenty-six inches long with a mili-
tary front sight the gunsmith can
cut this barrel down to twenty-four
inches remove the ugly front sight
and fit a modern sporting sight de-
signed for this particular rifle the
rear sight is crude and mounted on
the top of the receiver this could
readily be used for hunting purposes
but the average amateur prefers to
have this machined off and a good
peep sight mounted in its place

  the military stock can be cut
down and reformed to make a sport-
ing type but the average man de-
sires a stock made along neater lines
for about five dollars you can get a
good walnut blank roughly formed
on the outside and with the action
parts all inletted so that any good
craftsman can do the final fitting in
a few evenings many shooters pre-
fer to build their own in this fashion

mines
and mining

by j a thompson

  drift mining is the working of
placer gold deposits by underground
methods the system is applicable
where the gold values are held to a
fairly narrow well-defined pay
streak close to bedrock and where
there is considerable barren over-
burden above the gold-carrying
material moreover drift mining
can be used by individual prospec-
tors in small-scale operations no
extra expensive equipment is re-
quired but some knowledge of the
process is essential

  h h of charlotte north caro-
lina has asked us about drift min-
ing this week can an individual
drift mine he writes is the
method suitable for alaska which is
where my partner and i intend to
do some prospecting in the near fu-
ture how is it carried on

  those are the questions now for
the answers alaska because the
permanently frozen condition of

many of the placer gravel deposits
there eliminates the need of heavy
timbering in underground work is
one of the sections in which drift
mining has played an important role
in the past the method is also ex-
tensively employed in northern cali-
fornia in working old channel beds
bench gravels and buried placers

  among old-time alaskan prospec-
tors drift mining often afforded ex-
cellent opportunity for winter work
on the gold-flecked patches of a bed-
rock pay streak that could be taken
out best when the country was
frozen piled on a dump and washed
in summer when water for the pur-
pose was available

  today once you have first located
suitable gold gravel this same sys-
tem can be used the practice
formerly was to sink a small shaft
down to bedrock on the pay streak
the shaft should be located on the
lowest part of the channel and in
approximately the middle of the pay
from the shaft run a main drift or
tunnel the entire length of the claim
or the pay streak

  in working out the ground start
mining at the lower end of the main
drift by establishing working faces
across the channel at right angles to
the drift extending them of course
the full width of the pay streak in
small-scale work the custom in
alaska used to be to thaw the frozen
gravel with wood fires

  both care and skill were required
in handling these fires so as to keep
the heat directly against the face
otherwise the roof would warm up
and slough badly first kindling
was placed along the face when an
area of several hundred square feet
had been opened up on the top of
the kindling a layer of dry wood was
built up until it was roughly two feet
thick over this a layer of green


street  smiths western story

wood was sometimes set and the
whole thing covered with long sheet-
iron plates or else the dry wood
was simply topped off and muffled
with a thick layer of coarse gravel

  once lighted such fires usually
burned about five hours more or
less and would thaw the frozen
gravel about a foot back into the
face general custom was to build
and light the fires in the evening so
that they accomplished their thaw-
ing job during the night by morn-
ing the fires had burned out and at
the same time the thawed gravel had
not had a chance to refreeze the
day could then be spent in getting
out the thawed material wheeling it
to the shaft and hoisting it to the
ground surface for deposition on the
dump to await washing when
warmer weather came the face
was cleaned up and a new fire set
to thaw the next days quota of
gravel

  an average prospector working
fairly steadily under at least medium
satisfactory conditions ought to be
able to get out about a thousand
wheelbarrow loads of gold gravel
during a winter this way his re-
turns will naturally depend on how
much gold the ground averages per
wheelbarrow load where three or
four partners are working together
faster handling for the frozen pay
streak can often be obtained by sink-
ing two shafts instead of one the
shafts should be between fifty and
seventy-five feet apart while the
gravel is being mined from one shaft

thawing can be carried on from the
other

  pay streaks that are on bedrock
at a depth of anywhere from fifteen
to thirty feet below the surface are
the handiest depths for small-scale
drift mining in frozen ground such
as is prevalent in alaska large-
scale drift mining has been accom-
plished with bedrock depths as high
as two hundred feet such work
necessitates a hoist and other equip-
ment as well as considerable man
power

  in country where the ground is
not frozen northern california for
instance timbers and lagging must
be used both on top and sides of the
main drift to keep the ground from
sloughing faces are worked essen-
tially the same way except that
there is no need of pre-thawing the
ground it can be picked down
suitable timbering in the form of
posts lagging and head boards is
also required in the cross cuts

  likewise interested in gold pros-
pecting in alaska is j f of ta-
coma washington who writes that
just for the record he would like
to know when placer gold was first
discovered there

  in  a russian engineer made
the first reported discovery of placer
gold in alaska in the kenai river
basin gold was found in the
tanana valley in the s near
juneau in  and at circle and
forty-mile about

where to go
and how to
get there

by john north

  carrying along some sort of con-
centrated food or emergency ration
is important to every camper trap-
pers hunters timber cruisers and
prospectors out far from the beaten
trail may find themselves farther
from their base camp than they
anticipated or caught and kept
from camp several days by storms
swollen streams and a host of other
unpredictable occurrences that are
always cropping up to test the stam-
ina and the resourcefulness of the
true outdoorsman a pocket pack
of concentrated food on such occa-
sions may literally be a life saver

  moreover hikers off on a few days
jaunt into back-country wilderness
must perforce travel light canned
goods for such trips are heavy bulky
and awkward for the back packer to
handle concentrated foods have
none of these drawbacks on the
other hand they are primarily useful

 ws-b



as emergency rations and not in-
tended for a steady unsupplemented
diet over long periods of time

  a h of chicago illinois is one
of that ever-growing group of wil-
derness hikers men who are city liv-
ing but outdoor loving and who
find they can cram more real back-
to-nature stuff in a weeks walking
trip through woods and forests than
any other way how about con-
centrated foods for such trips
wrote a h remember shelter
food in fact everything i take with
me i tote on my back

  first and foremost among such
concentrated foods is that old
standby of the indian on long lone
trips-pinole our own famous
pioneer frontiersmen like daniel
boone davy crockett bridger and
their contemporaries relied heavily
on pinole even today down in the
southwest and particularly below
the border lone mexicans will start
off on trips of several days duration
with just a little sack of pinole tied
on behind their saddles

  xbout two heaping tablespoonfuls
of pinole stirred in a cup of cold
water will make a meal you drink
the stuff down and for the modern
traveler your pinole in water plus
a small handful of raisins another
excellent concentrated food will
make a pretty square meal with lots
of sustaining power

  pinole itself is simply pulverized
parched indian corn the corn can
be parched in a frying pan on the
stove stir it constantly however
to prevent scorching it the in-
dians used to parch it in hot wood
ashes until it was brown then sift
the ashes out and grind the corn at
home you can grind the corn yourself
in one of those old-fashioned coffee
mills that used to hang on nearly
every kitchen wall the idea is to
grind it fine enough to be drinkable


street  smiths western story

when mixed with water but not so
fine that it merely flours into a thin
paste when put into a water-filled
cup

  pinole was originally intended for
a quick meal while on the trail or
on long trips as an alternative
standby when game was scarce
it gets its staying qualities
not only because it is surpris-
ingly high in nutritive content but
also because when added to water
and consumed the parched corn
swells in the stomach creating that
customary full after-dinner feeling

  pemmican of course is the old
standby of arctic explorers and
hunters in the far northwest be-
cause it contains a considerable per-
centage of suet or fat it is essentially
a cold-climate concentrated food
the early-day pemmican of the far
north a standard item of diet
among the old hudson bay trappers
was made of lean buffalo meat dried
like jerky in the sun or over a fire
until it was hard and brittle then
pounded to powder the buffalo fat
and marrow was then melted mixed
to a pasty mass with the powdered
dried lean meat and the whole
packed into cloth bags

  thus prepared pemmican would
keep for years in the cold north
country climate it can be eaten
raw sliced and fried like sausage
or boiled with a little flour into a
thick heavy soup

  modern manufactured pemmican
is made of beef meat instead of buf-
falo but is just as nutritious as the

old-timers product perhaps even
more nutritious because as a rule
a little sugar and some raisins are
added to the manufactured beef
pemmican which is squeezed into
cakes and packed in moisture-proof
containers

  so much for the two mainstay
emergency rations-pinole for the
hot climate of the south and south-
west and pemmican for the cold
country of the north or for winter
travel neither of these foods alone
constitutes a balanced diet by any
means both are notably lacking in
the acid factor nowadays hiker
hunter trapper or trader can get
his daily fruit-juice vitamins on the
trail via the medium of concentrated
citric-acid or lime-juice tablets that
may easily be taken along anywhere
raisins as already mentioned are
an excellent concentrated food af-
fording a handy form of sugar

  tabloid tea tablets which come
a hundred in a little box that will
slip into your vest pocket and make
a cup of fairly good tea per tablet
are another modern innovation but
a real bread substitute still seems to
be the unsolved perhaps unsolvable
concentrated food problem regular
old-fashioned hardtack still remains
about the best emergency bread
ration dessicated eggs dried
milk powder and various forms
of compressed soups may also be in-
cluded on extended trips where food
bulk must be kept to a minimum
and at the same time a greater vari-
ety in diet is desired

the story so far

  steve mcgraw is hired by ed page to
eearch for the latters father lost in the
remote and unexplored dark river coun-
try in alaska where he went to search for
tin steve locates the missing prospector
and makes a rich find of tin when he re-
turns to seattle he finds that page with-
out his consent has formed a company to
develop the claim involved in a partner-
ship which he had entered involuntarily

port four

by frank
richardson pierce

steve is arrested with page on charge of
violating the stock-selling laws

  steve is paroled by the judge and al-
lowed to return to dark river on condition
that he fill a contract to supply a large
amount of tin clay bullock a mine pro-
moter who has a reputation for fleecing
miners out of their claims believes he has
steve in a hole because one of his men
filed on the dark river ground before
steve he intends however to let steve
street  smiths western story

get his operations under way and then take
over

  professor boyer one of bullocks men
who is posing as an anthropologist learns
that steve filed on the south fork of dark
river not on the north fork where bul-
locks claim is located realizing that bul-
locks plans will have to be changed he
sends word to the promoter

  steve charts a course over the ice from
schooner bay to the south fork in order
to bring a dredge to the place where min-
ing operations are to begin unknown to
him boyer has dynamited a hole in the
ice over which the dredge will have to pass

chapter xiv

ice-trapped

  the diesel motor turning over at
top speed pulled the dredge slowly
upstream the work proceeded
slowly until the engine man sud-
denly bellowed somebody better
take care of that wire rope its
twisting into loops as it comes off
the winch

  steve climbed onto the dredge
grasped a loom and got the rope
back onto a drum once more shes
o k now he said dont know
whether its the cold or what but
the lines giving a lot of trouble of
late ill hold it on a couple more
revolutions feed it to her

  o k

  a moment later the dredge gave
a convulsive shudder whats
that steve asked it felt like
something giving way

  the forward part of the dredge
was a third over the pit boyer had
dug when the ice on the downstream
end crumpled under the load the
dredge shot forward and the front
end was buried deep in the water
then as the buoyancy of the pon-
toons started lifting it up the end
wedged under the thick unbroken
ice ahead

  the engine man had shut off the
power but his body pitched forward
with the momentum and he cracked

his head on solid steel he slipped
into the water as it boiled over
windlass cable and engine pee
wee bompard leaped to the dredge
grasped the mans foot and hauled
him out his clothing glazed in-
stantly half conscious he gasped
steves down there

  steves down there pee wee
bellowed he turned to the watch-
ing men some of you fellers get
a fire goin an sleeping bags laid
out somebody tear the clothes offn
this man an get him into a bag
as pee wee talked paddy ho-
gan unnoticed was stripping off his
clothing he grasped a rope and
had dived into the black icy wa-
ters before anyone could stop him

  the fool pee wee shouted
that wont do any good

  paddy was down a long time at
last he broke through the skin of
ice that had formed and drew in
choking gasps of air ice was al-
ready beginning to glaze over his
face and head paddy shook his
head and spoke with difficulty
hes caught by the cable couldnt
hold my breath long enough-
pee wee hauled in the rope paddy
was grasping and pulled him clear
of the water he was hurried into
a sleeping bag

  youre a brave man pee wee
told him but it was the wrong
move

  me intentions was of the best
paddy said feebly i never was
so cold in me misspent life

  pee wee had pulled down a length
of half-inch water pipe now he
stripped off his clothing and picked
up a heavy chunk of iron get the
headlights of one of the tractors on
the spot he ordered

  the tractor was on its way almost
before he finished speaking he
turned to another man keep this
end of the pipe above water dont
dark frontier



let it get wet or itll ice over ive
got to breathe through it

  he eased himself into the ice wa-
ter and submerged lips to the other
end of the pipe it was awkward
and hard to handle a hose would
have been better but there was
none available ice coated the pipe
and every time it moved skin ice
was broken on the surface of the
water

  pee wee had to move crabwise
with his neck twisted in order to
keep his lips to the pipe but he
knew every inch of the dredge and
as his feet struck objects he identi-
fied them the heavy weight in his
right hand kept his body submerged
his feet touched a loop of cable
and he half turned his head by
the vague light seeping down from
the tractor headlights he saw steves
ankle tight in a loop of cable

  he got down close and studied it
looking up to make certain there
was nothing above to trap him he
dropped the weight and grasped the
cable he twisted it widened the
loop and then gripping the air pipe
in his teeth pulled steve free with
his left hand he got a good hold
on steves body and planted his feet
firmly on the dredge deck then
grasping the air pipe with his left
hand again he kicked upward

pee wee felt the ice break across
his back he held tightly to the
pipe while men h aujed him and
steve within reach pee wee kept
steves head under water until he
could work his hand over the uncon-
scious mans mouth and pinch his
nostrils tightly

  keep his mouth and nose cov-
ered he warned dont want the
water in em freezin up

  one of the men wrapped a blanket
around steves head and hurried
him to the fire others helped pee

wee now a weak stumbling giant
incased in a thin covering of ice

  a roaring fire had been made with
gasoline and driftwood men held
a tarp to inclose a small space and
imprison the heat pee wees coat-
ing of ice melted instantly he was
dried off with rough towels and put
into a sleeping bag other men had
removed steves clothing got him
into a bag and were now emptying
the water from his lungs

  keep it up pee wee ordered
hoarsely make him breathe
keep that fire going a blast of
freezin air might be fatal

  paddy was watching the opera-
tion with sober worried eyes aint
there some signs of life he asked

  not yet a man answered i
learned first aid as a boy scout and
if anybody laughs ill kill him
nobodys laughin paddy said
solemnly

  after what seemed hours to
paddy the big irishman saw steves
eyes flutter then the half-drowned
man began heaving up river water
from his stomach and coughing it
from his lungs

  keep that air warm pee wee
kept repeating frosted lungs
would kill him he spotted a man
who seemed to have no particular
job light out for the paddy creek
cabin and get a fire going make it
so hot the walls smoke but dont
burn the cabin down hey you
tractor man be ready to take steve
into your cab the rest of us will
ride on the sled

  anything we can do about the
dredge the engine man asked

  its here until spring one of the
men observed dejectedly then
the break-up will take care of every-
thing

  steve aint said so pee wee
said curtly he turned to another
man you leg it for schooner bay


street  smiths western story

tell em whats happened and ask
dorothy sheldon if she wants a
nursin job

  when steve could stare weakly at
the wreckage they carried him to
the tractor cab sleeping bag and
all its a mess he muttered
wonder how you go about getting
an ice-locked dredge out of a river
you just forget the dredge
pee wee told him itll keep
yeah paddy muttered itll
keep its in ice

pee wee had a hunch steve
wouldnt be on his feet the next
day and he was right steve was a
very sick man somewhere in the
crash he had received internal in-
juries of an undetermined nature
he remembered vaguely the heavy
ice on the edge of the hole leaping
at him perhaps he was thrown
against it-he didnt know but he
did remember one thing-there was
water filled with broken bits of ice
boiling around him just before he
passed out he knew this was no
air hole the dredge had tumbled
into

  paddy being in better shape than
pee wee was the logical man to
send on a special mission steve
sent for him

howre you feeling he asked
fit as a fiddlepaddy declared
paddy i think someone dug a
pit in the ice said steve then
they let it fill and freeze over you
know the rest

 if they did paddy said
shrewdly they mustve done some-
thing with the ice

  exactly steve exclaimed and
i want you to see if you can find it
take things easy dont hurry and
be careful not to frost your lungs
and another thing dont let any-
one know what youre up to i
want the report circulated that the

dredge dropped into an air hole

  leave it to me paddy told him

  to save himself unnecessary walk-
ing paddy rode a tractor down to
the dredge the headlights showed
him a lone figure contemplating the
wreck dorothy me darlin he
shouted

  the girl turned paddy there
was an anxious look on her face
hows steve

  hes in better shape than his
dredge is answered paddy

 im glad he mightve been
killed or drowned dorothy said
how did this happen steve told
me the ice had been tested every few
rods and the bad places marked
why tractors have gone over this
place for weeks and dragged heavy
loads on sleds

 its a secret paddy told her
but ill give you the low-down
he explained steves theory i
wouldnt mention it but youre a
friend of us boys even if you do
work for one of them grave diggers
im on me way now to hunt evi-
dence

 let me help you dorothy
begged

  no paddy answered youll be
more help lookin after steve pee
wee and i are afraid hell try and
get up and do somethin about the
dredge before hes able then hell
really be a sick man

  so dorothy went upriver through
the gloom while paddy searched for
likely spots to begin his search

  when dorothy got to the cabin
steve was running a temperature
a man was doing his best to hold
him in the bunk

  listen you steve was shout-
ing weve got to figure a way to
get the dredge out of there horse
it up onto the ice and keep it mov-
ing ive seen the break-up on dark
river ive seen the ice tumble
dark frontier



through black canyon that dredge
will last about as long as an antique
fiddle

  dorothy could see that he was
only half conscious he was really
trying to solve the problem but his
feverish brain couldnt maintain a
constant logical thought process

  all right steve the girl said
soothingly im going to help you
get back on your feet if youll
help it wont be long but if you
buck us theres no telling how long
youll be in bed

  but dont you see if youd just
take me down there and let me size
up the situation steve argued i
might work out something then a
crew of men could tackle the job
steve that isnt your biggest
problem right now dorothy said
sharply she took his arms and
forced him back onto the pillow
now relax

  that was the last thing steve
mcgraw remembered for some time
is next impression was of pee wee
pompard sitting beside the other
bunk where dorothy was stretched
cut

  poor kid pee wee said
youre all in i reckon pee wtee
was only a blur and steve closed
bis eyes and tried to straighten out
things

  when he opened his eyes again
pee wee was whittling on a piece
of wood cant figger it he said
savagely cant figger it

cant figure what steve asked
pee wee stopped whittling and
stared then he crossed the room
and looked down whats that
he asked say it again

  cant figure what steve re-
peated

  by golly son youre out of it
pee wee cried exultantly youre
yourself again for a minute i fig-

gered you was gettin fixed for an-
other session of ravin

  ive been out of my head eh

steve asked weaklv

                                     

 yep you had a whale of a
fever dorothy had a big hand in
pulling you through pee wee said
shes a mighty good little nurse

  its too bad i wasnt conscious
to enjoy it all steve grinned but
im still weak and ill need a nurse
quite a while longer suddenly
pee wees face seemed blurry again
steve knew he had been overdoing at
the start and settled back

  when he awakened from another
sleep dorothy was sitting in the
chair beside his bunk pee wtee and
his shavings had vanished

  ive put you to plenty of trou-
ble steve told the girl

  im terribly sorry you had to go
through such an ordeal dorothy
said but im glad i could nurse
you some of the time she walked
over and gazed out the window
steve did not hear her as she mur-
mured the debits have piled so
high and my credits are so few
she stood there trying to get a grip
on herself steves appreciation was
so deep it almost shattered her
poise she regained her composure
but there was no concealing the ex-
haustion in her face as she sat down
beside the bunk again

professor boyer appeared
later to ask how steve was get-
ting along he expressed his regret
at the disaster and asked if there
was any possible way of salvaging
the dredge steve made vague non-
committal replies to his questions

  when boyer left he motioned the
girl outside have you learned
anything of his future plans he
asked in a low voice

  hardly she answered hes
been unconscious


street  smiths western story

  sometimes unconscious men re-
veal things in their ravings boyer
suggested

  he hasnt mentioned a thing
dorothy said briefly and if he
had i wouldnt tell you i still have
some sense of ethics you know
boyer studied her intently and
shrugged his shoulders i guess
youd better return to schooner
bay he said they believe this
affair was an accident of course
steve hasnt been conscious long
enough to talk of it dorothy said
evasively

  paddy came to see steve the next
day it is just as you figgered
steve the irishman declared
somebody dug a hole i found the
hunks of ice-tons of it at first i
thought itd be like huntin for a
needle in a haystack then i says
paddy hogan use your head for
somethin besides buttin and i
used it just drove the tractor in
all the snowdrifts i could find
when i hit somethin solid as a rock
i investigated and there was the
ice-ragged pieces split up

  got any ideas

  there might be a spy planted in
our gang paddy said by brush-
in away the snow carefully i
thought i might find footprints or
somethin to prove who done it
what i fourfd was tractor marks
and we own the only tractors in
the region steve murmured well
paddy thanks and keep your find
to yourself you havent mentioned
it have you

  only to pee wee paddy as-
sured him

  dorothy came in in a few min-
utes she sent paddy away and told
steve he was to go to rest he
obeyed growling that she was al-
ways insisting on sleep just when
things were getting interesting
youre getting along all right

steve dorothy told him so i
must leave you professor boyer
insists that i return to schooner
bay and catch up on my work

  i suppose youll have to do it
steve said glumly i wish he
would fire you wed give you a
job in a hurry

  ill tell him dorothy smiled
maybe hell raise my pay ill send
pee wee in to look after you
steve must have fallen asleep
again because when he opened his
eyes again dorothy was gone pee
wee was sitting there with another
pile of shavings at his feet

  i see you havent solved the
problem yet steve remarked
well what is it

  dorothy gave strict orders you
shouldnt talk about minin and the
dredge for another week pee wee
explained but times flyin as
the feller says ive practically
whittled up a tree try in to figger a
way of gettin that dredge out but
i havent had any luck

  tomorrow steve said youre
goin to bundle me up and take me
down there

pee wee argued the point the
next day threatening steve
with dorothys wrath but he lost
steve was carried out to the dredge

  there was a smugness about the
way the river held the bulky ma-
chine in its icy grasp that challenged
him boiled down the problem was
simple push back the river re-
move the ice lift the dredge onto
the ice and continue on up the
stream

  howre you goin to push back
the river pee wee grumbled when
steve outlined the problem if we
had a lot of cement we could build
a bulkhead around the dredge to
keep the river out and- he
stopped and looked a little reseat-


ful you aint listenin to what im
sayin

  youve hit it steve said excit-
edly a bulkhead put the men
to work cutting trees long enough
to reach the river bottom and a lit-
tle to spare trim the branches off
and bring em down on sleds carry
every tree you can each trip the
tractors make to save fuel

  then to his disgust steve real-
ized he was beginning to feel tired
already i guess youd better get
me back to the cabin i cant seem
to take it like i used to

chapter xv

the easy way out

a day after steve visited the
dredge every man except pee
wee was at work in a patch of tim-
ber a mile up paddy creek kula-
lik grew restless and took to snarl-
ing for no good reason

  a dog teams coming steve re-
marked kulalik always acts that
way when he scents a rival dog
its probably professor boyer

  pee wee rubbed the frost off the
window and looked out a fine
team with tails up to prove their
freshness and with plumes of vapor
coming from their mouths pulled up
in front of the cabin and stopped
the driver a swarthy heavy-set
man tied the dogs to convenient
trees and helped a big man from the
sled

 holy mackerel pee wee
roared steve its clay bullock
bullock steve sat up in the
bunk are you sure

  id know him in hell pee wee
growled how the devil did he get
here and whats he want

  a plane equipped with skis could
land on schooner bay steve said
and it could bring dog team and
outfit with it well we mustnt for-

hot tea and food and a drink of
whiskey if he wants it

  this is going to hurt me pee
wee muttered but ill go through
with it when bullock yelled and
knocked on the cabin door pee wee
opened it the big man stamped
into the room and looked around

  ilello bullock steve said qui-
etly whats going on outside
we havent been getting much over
the radio too much magnetic iron
in the mountains i guess

  the price of tin is holding up
bullock answered as he shed his
parka thats what you want to
know isnt it this is one of my
men big chris maybe youve
heard of him

  yes steve answered he was
watching big chris and pee wee
sizing up each other

  so youre pee wee bompard
big chris said i hear you claim
to be a rough-and-tumble fighter
i never make any claims
drawled pee wee i mind my own
business-he paused and added
significantly-as long as others
mind theirs

  he knew all about big chris too
one of the most valued men in bul-
locks employ he was a past master
in the art of taking the fight out of
rival outfits cripple em but
dont kill em was supposed to be
his motto rivals buried dead men
but they had to care for cripples
and that was an added burden if
robins heralded spring then big
chris heralded trouble

  bullock and big chris ate the
food pee wee gave them in silence
then bullock settled back and lit a
cigar

  got bad news for you steve
he said casually im takin over
the companys operations here got
a court order appointin me re-
ceiver

  first you were a friend of the
courts steve observed and now
the courts a friend of yours well
you and the court can go to hell
youre not taking things over until
youre biggern you are now

  i expected a little trouble with
you bullock said lazily

  you should youve had plenty
of experience in that line steve
said

  yes and im prepared i had
big chris here appointed deputy
united states marshal bullock
continued want to sec his au-
thority

  yes steve answered

chris nonchalantly turned back
his coat then amazement filled
his eyes my badges gone he
exclaimed somebody stole it
dont look at me pee wee
growled i havent been near you
i wont insist on a badge steve
said just show me your commis-
sion chris and ill accept you as
special deputy to do bullocks dirty
work

  chris took out a billfold and
opened it again surprise filled his
eyes commissions gone too he
glared about him with rage-filled
eyes somebody swiped it from
me

  steve grinned youve got to
show your authority chris before
you can order me around he said

  ive a receivers authority bul-
lock said angrily and im taking
over now look here mcgraw
youre under suspended sentence
right now in a state court if you
get tough and resist me youll have
to serve out your sentence and
youll be subject to a federal con-
tempt charge as well

  what started this receivership
steve asked youre back of it of
course
dark frontier



  i had a man cached back in the
hills checking over things bullock
explained glibly he learned youd
actually staked the south fork
giound i pointed out to judge
lund that you had used deception
youd let him think the north fork
ground was involved the receiver-
ship was a cinch then he grinned
then coming upriver what do i
see you know damned well what
i see-a dredge iced in

  i dont think this hombres
showing the proper attitude boss
big chris grinned maybe id bet-
ter work on him if he has any ideas
cf resistin the law

  i dont have to take your word
on the deputy-marshal business
steve pointed out and bullock
knows it you cant come into
country like this and assume au-
thority without proof

  boss lets go outside and talk
things over chris said im ready
to move in now

  i think wed belter bullock
drawled with a dredge ready to
go out with the ice the situations
changed i imagine the poor de-
luded stockholders of mcgraw-page
metals will be tickled to death to
unload their claims on me-if i put
it up to the court in the right way
the two pulled on their parkas and
went outside

  what do you say steve pee
wree asked in a hoarse whisper is
this receiver and marshal business
on the level

  i think it is steve admitted
he had a man watching us which
doesnt surprise me at all the man
made his way to some cannery or
settlement and communicated with
bullock by radio im dead sure
chris had his badge and commis-
sion but lost it which is lucky for
us we may have to do some back-
ing down now pee wee and swal-

low an insult or two that wont taste
sweet but were going to do it
knowing our turn will come to even
things up with fists keep your
temper and leave everything to me
but bullock and big chris sur-
prised them when they returned
youre right mcgraw bullock
said youre entitled to see chris
authority and he cant produce it
we wont make an issue of it have
you any objections to us sleeping
here tonight

  none in the world steve said
make yourself at home

 they may sleep pee wee
growled when the two went out to
bring in their sleeping bags but i
wont theyre up to something
youre right steve agreed but
it wont happen tonight im sure
of that i dont want them to know
about the tree-cutting gang you
light out and warn the boys against
showing up around the cabin

bullock was a genial enter-
taining guest he related what
had happened outside during the
winter and told a few yarns in
spite of his dislike for bullock steve
had an enjoyable evening but big
chris and pee wee scowled at each
other all night

  in the morning when he and big
chris were ready to leave bullock
said mcgraw youre - licked and
you know it youve got a jail sen-
tence hanging over you besides
now string along with me and ill
not only put you on my pay roll
and give you a chunk of money to
boot but ill go to judge lund ex-
plain you did everything possible to
deliver the goods and get him to
suspend your sentence for good its
an easy way out

  no dice steve said promptly
ill play my hand through and next


street  smiths western story

fall ill either be in the money or in
jail

  pee wee trailed bullock and big
chris all the way to schooner bay
a light snowstorm concealed him
nicely and when he arrived he
slipped into the bunkhouse without
being seen only a few mcgraw-
page men occupied the structure
now most of the others including
the resentful ed page were upriver

  doctor zednick had moved in
along with several of professor boy-
ers men just to be on the safe
side pee wee occupied a storage
room on the second floor he heard
bullock come in during the evening
and say im flying back to seat-
tle and will be glad to take any let-
ters you want to write ill leave
my dogs and ample food to the man
who will take care of them and work
them

  thats very generous of you mr
bullock bover said i already
have a team but i can use another
i have some supplies i want to
freight up river i expect to make
some important discoveries this
coming year

  pee wee heard dr zednick give
the snort of disgust which he used
to express his opinion of boyer
then quiet settled as the man set-
tled down to write their letters pee
wee turned in awakened at four
oclock and peering through a crack
in the floor noticed some were still
writing

  the mcgraw-page storekeeper
who also acted as postmaster sold
stamps received the letters and
placed them in a pouch pee wee
sneaked into the kitchen a few min-
utes later ate a hurried meal then
faded into the lightly falling snow
he made his way over the schooner
bay ice to a drift near bullocks
plane then he burrowed in and

waited it was a long cold wait
for the air didnt clear until after
daybreak

  i had the pious idear of fixin
their plane so itd quit and set em
down two hundred miles from no-
where pee wee told himself
chuckling but my second idear
was a better one he chuckled
again itll give steve a laugh
too and fill him with hope and he
aint had much to laugh at lately

  pee wee would have liked to visit
with dorothy sheldon but he de-
cided it would be just as well if he
left as quietly as he had arrived
when he reached the dredge on the
upstream trip the first sled load of
trees had arrived he rode the trac-
tor the remainder of the way and
found steve sitting up in a chair
when he reached the cabin

  full of business eh pee wee
said

  yeah had two of the boys
build a cabin on a sled he said
im moving in and the tractor will
haul it downstream they put in
windows next to the lower bunk so
i can rest and watch operations at
the dredge you get the upper bunk
and the cooking job

  now listen here pee wee pro-
tested you arent well enough to
do that

  if im in a bunk and warm
thats all thats necessary steve
told him i can just as well be
watching the men work as to be
here looking at the ceiling whatd
you find out down below

  i tried to find out whether bul-
lock was on friendly terms with any
of the grave-diggers pee wee an-
swered he didnt seem to be
though but somebody is playin
his game and weve got to find who
it is or theyll knife your plans in
the back again
dark frontier



the shack on the sled was tried
out the next day steve was
moved without the slightest discom-
fort and pee wee cooked his first
meal on a yukon stove en route
half of the force was on hand to
greet the two of them the other
half remained in the woods under
steves instructions pee wee
marked out an area that included
the dredge

  all youve got to do he said
is to cut holes in the ice and shove
trees down to the bottom each
tree is to be pointed on the end
you take sledge hammers and drive
it into the bottom a few inches
cut the holes as you need em oth-
erwise theyll freeze up

  ft was slow work because the
trees were placed tightly together
in a few days the supply was ex-

hausted and steve sent all hands
back to the woods again paddy
hogan was straw boss and he saw
to it that ed page did more than
his share of work if there were
trees to pack ed had to carry one
end a husky man the other rather
than drop his end and be subjected
to a rawhiding ed stayed with it
all the while nursing his hate of
steve paddy and the others he
had long since ceased trying to get
by on personality

  steve spent less time each day in
his bunk and more on the ice the
second week he put in a full shift
but he continued to live in the
shack the others lived in the for-
est camp a mile above paddy creek
canyon

 the great day came when the
dredge was completely inclosed with

street  smith s western story

trees steve had the men bring
down piping and pumps from page
city and set them up every tarp
hide and blanket that could be
spared was brought up also ice
was cut on the outer side of the
fence and the tarps lowered into the
water there was no trouble in fas-
tening the upper edge it froze to
the trees almost as soon as it
touched

  o k steve said now pump
out the water around the dredge and
well see what happens

  while ice imprisoned the dredge
nevertheless the lower part was in
the water area below the ice it was
necessary to turn the pumps over at
top speed and keep them insulated
besides otherwise they would have
frozen up tight water gushed from
the outlet moved a few inches and
froze this problem was solved by
the crew breaking up the slabs and
skidding them downstream

  steve watched the ice around the
dredge carefully presently it be-
gan to break up drop an inch or so
then the space between glazed over
only to break as the slabs sank
lower

  this is a crazy expensive idea
ed page sneered

  thats because you havent any
brains retorted pee wee the
fence of trees helps keep the water
from reaching the area around the
dredge the pressure of the water
against the tarps stops the water
from seeping in between

  well not quite that steve said
but almost

  thats it ed insisted it
comes in faster than the pumps can
take it out

  not quite steve insisted
were gaining slightly

  and using up costly fuel ed ar-
gued

  steve stayed up all night and all

of the next day that night the
pumps sucked the inclosure dry
water seeping slowly through tarps
and trees had gradually frozen seal-
ing everything tight what re-
mained turned to ice steve put a
gang to work removing the remain-
ing ice then went to bed he was
satisfied with the progress they had
made but he knew the toughest job
was ahead

chapter xvi

no admittance

steve still underweight and
lacking his usual strength ar-
rived by tractor at schooner bay
a few minutes after he sat down in
the bunkhouse mess room dorothy
sheldon and professor boyer ar-
rived

  whats going on upriver boyer
asked curiously not that its any
of my business he added

  were doing the best we can
steve answered

  i heard youd put up a barricade
below the dredge and erected a no
admittance sign

  thats right steve admitted
its our way of handling a little
problem in case clay bullock has
men planted in the region we dont
want them to know what is going
on barring everyone is easier than
trying to find out whos who we
came down to pick up a little equip-
ment we need later well be glad
to have visitors im sure you can
realize we have to take this stand
plenty depends on our success one
more mishap and we wont be able
to operate next season

  more power to you boyer said
with an enthusiasm he did not feel
let me know when the bars are
down dorothy and i have just
about finished our work the
break-up is a long way off and time
dark frontier

will hang heavy on our hands you
wouldnt permit me to examine the
ice man would you

  doctor zednick had entered just
in time to hear the request mr
mcgraw realizes by this time youre
no anthropologist he told boyer
hotly hell not permit you to ruin
the greatest find-

  im getting tired of your insults
zednick boyer flared

  gentlemen gentlemen steve
admonished when the time comes
ill give the ice man to the scientist
who proves to me hes the most ad-
vanced in his work

  thank you mcgraw zednick
said the ice man as you persist
in calling him is as good as mine
right now

  boyer and dorothy left a few
minutes later without the girl hav-
ing an opportunity to talk to steve
as they walked along boyer said
dorothy the time has come for
you to make up for the blunder you
caused when you reported that
steve had staked the north fork
ground i think hes more than half
in love with you

  i nursed him dorothy said qui-
etly and he may feel a little ro-
mantic but hell get back to nor-
mal as soon as hes himself

  i think youre wrong there its
more than appreciation with a lit-
tle playing up on your part you
could have him eating out of your
hand barrier or no barrier youre
going up there on a visit youre
going to bring that pup to heel and
find out just what he expects to do
i see she said thoughtfully
im to make him feel im in love
with him win his confidence-
become engaged to him if neces-
sary boyer insisted bullock will
remember you when its all over
its a part ive never played
dorothy said slowly

  i think youll do all right said
boyer steve mcgraw has been
too busy trying to lick the frontier
to pick up an education on the tricks
of the fair sex youll find your part
easy enough in a day or two youll
go upstream slip past the barrier-
whatll i give as an excuse
tell them anything boyer said
tell them im in a romantic
mood he looked at her intently
and dorothy flushed which
wouldnt be far from the truth you
know

when the tractors left schooner
bay they were hauling the big
timbers used as ways when the
dredge was built loaded on a sled
were the powerful jacks used in
shifting the dredge

  men had already cleared away
the ice that had gripped the bottom
of the dredge considerable work
had been done inside where water
had entered and frozen the
dredge was heavy enough without
its load of ice

  the heavy timbers were placed
under the dredge a task that re-
quired many days work they had
only started the job when the man
on guard at the barrier sent for
steve miss sheldon wants to
come upstream he said you said
nobody was to be passed and i
figgered that included girls too
right steve answered ill go
down and talk to her he found
her sitting demurely in the watch-
mans shack anything wrong
he asked

  yes dorothy answered pro-
fessor boyer has been getting a lit-
tle romantic hes my boss and i
didnt want a scene either so i told
him i was getting away from it all
for a few days she looked at
steve appealingly of course if
your rule includes me ill go back
ill

street  smiths western story

i can make boyer head in i sup-
pose

  youll do nothing of the kind
steve said come along with me
were doing some interesting things
when you get tired of watching you
can go on to the paddy creek cabin
and make yourself at home did
you bring anything with you

 my sleeping bag and a few
clothes on a hand sled she an-
swered

  ryou can have the cabin pee
wee and ill stay in the sled shack
he said

  steve was glad to have the girl
with him again she was fresh and
stimulating it seemed to him she
was not only interested in his work
but pulling for him to overcome the
obstacles that kept presenting them-
selves

  heres the idea he said when
they reached the dredge we jack
up the dredge a few inches admit
water and let it freeze solid then
using the ice as a base we jack it
up some more in time well have
the dredge level with the river sur-
face and well continue the journey

  a week later the watchman again
sent word to steve the latter went
down and found boyer at the barri-
cade hello professor he said
cheerfully

  i came for my secretary boyer
said we had a little quarrel and
i think i ought to apologize i guess
i had a touch of cabin fever

  i know steve said but doro-
thy cant go back awhile you see
she knows whats going on and
while im sure she wouldnt mention
the matter to you we cant take any
chances

  boyers pretended indignation
was well done he raved stormed
and said that steves action bor-
dered on kidnaping but steve didnt
weaken during a lull in the boy-

ers protest the canyon echoed with
the roar of motors

  whats that boyer asked for-
getting his anger in his curiosity

  that professor steve an-
swered is the dredge moving up-
stream again

  you mean to say that you got
it out of the ice its actually mov-
ing ahead you got it out of that
hole you- boyer was so dum-
founded he couldnt talk

  thats about the size of it
steve admitted congratulate me
boyer bullock hasnt quite got the
upper hand im knocking on wood
understand but were out of one
bad hole

  i congratulate you boyer said
regaining his poise but i still re-
sent your holding my secretary pris-
oner

  ill take the responsibility
steve answered and dont bother
to come up again well send her
back when i think its safe

  boyer had difficulty restraining
himself then he remembered that
an outburst wouldnt be in keeping
with his position he turned and
walked slowly down the canyon

steve hitched up the dogs that
night and asked dorothy if she
wanted a ride he wanted to exer-
cise the dogs he told her

  he drove to the forks without
stopping some of the time he rode
the runners at others he ran be-
side the sled he helped the girl
from the sled while the dogs were
resting

  i didnt bring you up here just
for the ride he told her quietly
i wanted to talk wanted to forget
im a cog in a machine called mc-
graw-page metals and youre a cog
in boyers machine i wanted to
think of the two of us as a couple
of human beings but first i want
dark frontier



to tell you boyer wanted me to send
you down river today i told him
that you knew too much that you
had to stay

  and he didnt like it dorothy
asked

  not much answered steve
do you know i have the feeling
you wouldnt mind staying up here
awhile that itd be a change
im glad you didnt send me
down steve she said

  im beating around the bush
he said hesitantly in trying to tell
you how i feel about things
dorothy smiled faintly i know if
you gave me your word you
wouldnt mention how things are go-
ing with us youd keep it

  now youre getting into some-
thing else she said ive made
certain agreements with professor
boyer and his people i intend to
carry out those agreements to the
letter

  are you trying to tell me doro-
thy steve said only half seriously
that if boyers anthropology plans
and mine clashed youd fight me
to the last ditch steve doro-
thy said quietly

  good youre my kind of per-
son he said always go through
with any deal youve made thats
what im trying to do for the stock-
holders and jerry page pay them
dividends and make jerrys dream
come true by producing the tin we
need i dont think tin production
and grave digging will clash but
if it does well be good enemies
yes she answered she looked
at him and realized his thoughts
were far from tin and anthropology
something fine and enduring in his
face touched her deeply and she
was prepared for his next words

  weve been through a lot doro-
thy steve said and we know our
way of life i know what you can
ws-b

do in my life and you know what
i can do in yours some of the time
ill be in the city but most of the
time ill be on the frontier i want
you to go along with me there
may be better ways for a man to tell
a girl he loves her than just saying
i love you but i dont know
them

  there are no better ways she
answered

  that was all except her face
framed by the fur of her parka hood
was very beautiful steve told him-
self it wasnt just the physical
beauty of a lovely girl but the
spiritual beauty of a girl whom he
loved and who loved him he kissed
her and held her in his arms

  no matter what happens he
said tenderly no matter how wide
our trails separate well make them
come together again wont we

  yes steve she answered then
her face clouded as she remembered
that boyer had once ordered her to
make steve love her well she
thought wearily he ought to be
satisfied

the barrier guard glanced down
black canyon and yawned va-
por billowed from his mouth with
each breath he was bored no
one had come up the canyon in
days but this morning kulalik
who was there to keep him company
as well as warn him of the approach
of strangers suddenly grew inter-
ested he pricked his ears and
sniffed the guard got out his
sawed-off shotgun it was a very
effective weapon but steve had told
him never to use it

  several minutes passed then a
lone figure came out of the gloom of
the bend the guard put down the
shotgun but he looked surprised
the new arrival was the storekeeper
from schooner bay


street  smiths western story

  im softern a kettle of mush
the man panted listen hightail
it upriver and tell steve theres hell
to pay bullock and a bunch of
thugs hit schooner bay last night
how could they the guard
asked did they come by plane
no hired a arctic tradin
schooner one with plenty of iron
on its bow it bucked the ice into
the bay and landed sleds boats
tractors and a mountain of grub on
the ice theyre gettin the stuff
onto the land i figger theyll be
cornin up the canyon in a day or
two

  you go back to schooner bay
the guard advised take your
time and if you can keep em from
knowin you come up here so much
the better bullock may have an
idea hell catch us by surprise
the guard hurried to the paddy
creek cabin and sent a man on to
page city where steve was keeping
a watchful eye on the dredge which
was now nearing its destination
the guard returned to his post
ready for business if necessary and
it was well he did for soon he could
hear the roar of a tractor coming
over the ice

  the barrier was formed of ice
blocks and logs five or six inches
through and thirty feet ng the
guard got behind a mass of ice and
waited until the tractor stopped
two men got out to move the logs

  nothin doin brother the
guard warned this is private
property didnt they tell you
down at schooner bay nobody
could pass here

  clay bullock swinging his big
shoulders aggressively got out of
the tractor cab you cant get
away with this he blustered
come here chris and arrest this
man big chris unloaded his bulk
from a sled load of grub

  you step over that barrier or
touch it the guard said and ill
let you have both barrels that
ought to pretty well take care of
things

  he means it big chris said
he looked at bullock

  wheres mcgraw bullock de-
manded

  ive sent for him the guard
said he was hoping the store-
keeper had managed to slip past
without being noticed

  an hour passed then ed page ap-
peared he had heard a rumor of
approaching tractors and had come
down to investigate

  hello page bullock said easily
talk some sense into this man will
you weve got claims on the north
fork and if we dont get our grub in
over the ice were licked

  thats right ed agreed what
about the receivership business

  ill talk that over with mcgraw
when he shows up now confiden-
tially bullock continued youll
admit- his voice grew low and
confident ed stepped closer

  i wouldnt do it page the
guard warned youre flirtin with
a rattlesnake

  dont be foolish ed snapped
mr bullock and i have something
to discuss

 something i dont want the
world to hear bullock growled
his hand shot out and grasped eds
wrist he jerked him over the bar-
ricade and big chris leaping to
lend a hand caught the other wrist
and twisted eds arm up behind his
back

  sweat poured down eds face
and he turned white from pain

  dont worry chris said grimly
i wont break your arm ill just
pull it out of the shoulder socket
he grinned at bullock been itch-
in to get my hands on one of them

mcgraw-page fellers for a long
time sorry it aint mcgraw but
this one will do

  bullock looked at the guard
how about it do we go upriver
or does chris work over your chump
boss

  hes no boss of mine the guard
answered twist and be damned
and i wont lift a hand hes the
cause of all this trouble if he
hadnt got drunk and blabbed youd
still think you owned the pay
ground and you wouldnt be here

  chris twisted and ed alternately
begged bullock and the guard for
mercy its no use bullock said
at length you can tear him apart
and get nowhere he stepped
nearer the guard i can use a man
like you ill pay you twice what
youre getting and give you five
hundred dollars bonus to quit right
now

  ill take no bonus half the pay
and stick with steve the guard an-
swered crisply bullock shrugged
and made no more offers the group
settled down to wait the men on
the load got off and walked around
beating their arms against their
sides and stamping their feet to keep
circulation moving

it was three hours before steve ar-
rived he came on a dog sled
with pee wee riding the runners
and the team on the dead run the
dogs had been fresh and in racing
form when they started but they
were ready to drop in their tracks
at the finish

  in the distance steve could hear
his own tractors coming downstream
with his men and another coming
upstream he wasnt expecting a
showdown this early in the game
but he was ready for it

  wheres your badge and com-
mission chris he demanded

and let us through were peaceful
men

  the only time youre peaceful
steve answered is when somebody
beats hell out of you

  lets start in and make him
peaceful pee wee suggested

  not yet waitll the others get
here steve said no need of
playing bullocks game he could
see the others move up he saw
chris give ed pages arm a twist
and he noticed eds lips trembling
like a frightened kids

  steves tractor pulling a sled
black with men came around a
bend the sled skidding dangerously
they unloaded and grouped behind
steve paddy was in this group
he forged his way to the front then
started to go over the barrier steve
pulled him back

  just a minute he said i want
to be sure we arent fighting a
deputy marshal and posse now
lets see your credentials chris

  chris answer was cut short by
the arrival of the downstream trac-
tor steve expected bullock re-
inforcements but to his surprise
professor boyer and dr zednick
jumped off the tractor

  well steve exclaimed when
did you fellows start billing and coo-
ing

  dr zednick snorted necessity
makes strange bedfellows

  we were afraid wed get a short
shift if you miners started fighting
boyer explained so we got to-
gether

  we ask permission to take the
remainder of our outfit through
zednick said my people hearing
that a trading schooner with power
for ice breaking was coming to the
bay sent me additional supplies
mr bullock very kindly offered to
bring them

  and he brought men and sup-

piles for me too boyer said his
contribution to science-

  forget it bullock said i had
the space and was glad to accom-
modate you its too bad mcgraw
isnt accommodating

  all right go ahead steve
agreed pee wee and paddy re-
moved the logs they kept their
eyes on the enemy ready to meet
any attack too ready in fact
steve had to calm them twice

  the tractor dragging sleds loaded
with supplies snorted by at that
precise moment big chris evi-
dently believing bullock would rush
the opening momentarily relaxed
his grasp on ed as he set himself
ed jerked free and fairly soared over
the barrier big chris leaped the
barrier and pee wees fist caught
him flush on the jaw it staggered
him but he didnt go down

  wait a minute bullock roared
chris come here obey orders
blast it

  pee wee you hair-trigger mug
stop it steves half-joking repri-
mand checked pee wee

  im not ready for the showdown
mcgraw bullock said well test
this later i want plenty of john
law to back my hand

  youre yellow jeered a mc-
graw man

  thatll do steve warned
turn the tractor around bul-
lock ordered in sullen silence his
men returned climbed on the loaded
sleds and began lighting pipes and
cigarettes the tractor snorted
turned and moved slowly down river

  yellow the mcgraw man re-
peated

  no steve answered youre
dead wrong bullock doesnt hire
yellow men remember hes smart
and he knows its important to win
only one battle-the last hes up
to something were going to shift
dark frontier



the barrier closer to paddy creek
cabin theres a narrower spot
thats easier to defend and help can
get to the guards quicker i want
to thank you boys for keeping cool
and obeying orders

  steve put on extra guards at the
new barrier and sent the others
away to rest up late that night
the tractor and empty sleds came
back from page city boyer and
the driver were alone

  did you murder dr zednick
steve inquired

  im saving that until later
boyer answered laughing zed-
nick and his men are watchin the
supplies were going back after
another load

  another steve asked

  yes boyer answered the
last

chapter xvii

an early break-up

steve pee wee and paddy
hooked empty sleds onto their
fastest tractor and followed boyer
down to schooner bay the three
carried a sawed-off shotgun rifle
and six-guns

  heres a swell chance for big
chris to flash his badge steve said
if hes got one

  the brock-bullock crowd was
shifting a ton of supplies from the
beach to the river bank bullock
was surprised at steves unexpected
appearance but he made no move
steves men loaded their few re-
maining supplies onto the sleds left
enough to last the storekeeper until
the first steamer arrived then
started back

  well follow you boyer said
the return was made without in-
cident they unloaded one sled at
paddy creek cabin then steve took
over the tractor and drove away
while the others ate when they

had finished he was back again and
there was a very small square load
on the sled paddy and pee wee
i can use you he said

  youd better take some more of
us a man urged i hear bullocks
tractors cornin again

  listen you fighting fool steve
said save it for later on

  pee wee and paddy climbed
aboard and steve drove the tractor
at top speed to the barricade they
could hear the bullock tractors com-
ing theyre wide open pee wee
said and draggin the limit load
i can tell by their exhausts

  ones ahead two are quite a
way behind steve said boyer
hasnt passed yet

  boyer came around the turn a
few minutes later he stopped on
steves signal

  whatve you got on the sleds
steve demanded

  cases of canned goods boyer
answered tools for my men and
a few odds and ends

  steve brought the butt of the
shotgun down on a bulge in a tarp
and a man howled you didnt
mention having a phonograph with
a record on steve said softly

  if theres a man hiding in that
load its a surprise to me boyer
shouted he ran back but steve
made him return to the tractor

  come out of there steve or-
dered hands up he stepped
back and a bullock man crawled
out now unlash that load the
man obeyed revealing ten men
crouched on the last sled a frame-
work supporting the tarp gave it the
appearance of a well-lashed load of
canned goods

  boyer with a show of indignation
lighted into them you threw off
food ill need and hid on my sled
he shouted whats the meaning
of this


street  smiths western story

  very simple professor steve
answered the boys had an idea
theyd jump us from behind while
bullock and the others kept us
busy in front go on and dont
stop he grinned at the men as
boyer disappeared a fine lot of
suckers you turned out to be you
dont suppose we werent expecting
some such trick turn around and
get going

faced with a sawed-off shotgun
the men obeyed the moment
they were out of sight steve and
his companions began digging holes
in the ice he removed cases of
powder from his load inserted fuses
in several sticks loaded the holes
and covered the powder with ice and
snow then tramped it down

  the three lighted the fuses
hopped onto the tractor and rode to
the nearest bend a hundred yards
away it was midday and fairly
light in this part of the canyon
gray smoke rolled from the fuses
it was still rolling when bullocks
tractor came around a bend he
saw the smoke and knew instantly
what was happening a few seconds
later the blasts went off almost as
one ice filled the air water gey-
sered up then fragments tumbled
back and smoke slowly drifted up
the canyon

  bullock and his men left their
tractors and came over the ice a
yawning hole a hundred feet wide
and extending from wall to wall
separated the factions steve
looked at the hole choked with shat-
tered ice then at the men then be-
yond he noticed for the first time
that sheet steel had been attached
to the tractor cabs bullock had in-
tended coming through regardless
of shotguns

  steve lighted a cigarette watch-
ing the baffled expressions on the

faces of the bullock men it was
slowly dawning on them just what
this meant it was still cold enough
for the surface to glaze over but the
ice would never be thick enough to
support a tractor

  youre building up one hell of a
debt mcgraw bullock said at last
what with selling stock unlawfully
resisting officers and dynamiting
river ice youre going to be in the
pen a long time

  it had to be done bullock
steve said you should look upon
this as a beautiful compliment it
indicates i have such a wholesale
respect for your dirty fighting that
im trying to head it off youre
right ive troubles enough deliver-
ing tin as per contract without tak-
ing you on too

 bullock made no answer he
stared long and hard at the ice as
if speculating on means of getting
across then he started to look at the
canyon rim but changed his mind

  its winning the last battle that
counts boys he said finally lets
go back

  steve listened until the roar of the
tractors had diminished then be
went back to paddy creek canyon
the men there swarmed around
what happened they asked we
heard a blast

 what you heard steve an-
swered was an early break-up

steve left two men to guard the
break in case it froze thick
enough to bear a mans weight he
didnt want the bullock crowd sift-
ing across and scattering in the back
country all the others moved to
page city in the next two days
the dredge passed the small settle-
ment and moved on to the south
side of the south fork

  steve opened a case of whiskey
and told the boys to use their own
dark frontier



 judgment by way of celebration
 within an hour their judgment was
 sound or unsound depending on the
 viewpoint not a quartet but a
 male chorus sang sweet adeline
 and little liza jane as they had
 never been sung before

   voices carried far on the cold still
 air and presently dorothy stood in
 the doorway of her shack listening
 boyer came out of his cabin

   a lot of fine-feathered cocks are
 crowing too soon he observed
 and we know it dont we

   thats the way it usually works
 out the girl answered but what
 can bullock do now hes stopped
 dead in the canyon and in a few
 weeks it will be white water

  i dont know what hell do
 boyer answered but i know hes
 one man whos never stopped dead
 damn it all if steve mcgraw
 hadnt looked into that sled load
 wed be sitting pretty right now
 but steve did the girl said
 and hed have been much dumber
 than i think he is if hed let you get
 away with anything like that
 the male chorus stopped while
 the members argued over the next
 number pee wees voice booming
 like a rapids came clear and sharp
 hey ed none of this sissy drink-
 in drink er straight like a man

 or if you must have water drink
 the water first bottoms up boys
 a period of silence ensued followed
 by what appeared to be violent
 coughing then there was a burst
 of laughter and pee wee bellowed
 fine work ed well make a man
 out of you yet

   hours later the voices had been
 reduced to three dorothy growing
 curious made her way down to the
 south fork then walked along the
 ice for some distance on the high-
 est part of the dredge she saw three
 figures silhouetted against the sky

singing to the moon the sur-
vivors she said softly steve
paddy and pee wee

  even they faded before dawn and
the silence on the south fork was
impressive for the next twelve hours
steve was the first up followed by
ed who muttered and held pieces
of ice to his head

  im dying of thirst steve he
complained i thought men only
died of thirst on the desert

  heres an eye-opener steve
said pouring him a small drink
toss it off well boys the party
is over we start hitting the ball
again

  everyone in the region watched
the days lengthen the sun grow
warmer and winter gradually fade
the creeks began gathering melting
snow and spilling the water into the
forks it spread crusted over at
night and made dangerous over-
flows dr zednick formed the habit
of following steve about and pee
wee nicknamed the serious explo-
sive man shadow in time boyer
followed zednick explaining that if
steve uncovered any anthropologi-
cal evidence of the frontier that was
once dark he wanted to be in on it

  steve explained that he was
checking over the ground once more
in order to be ready to work that
which thawed first the break-up
was near when a snowslide slipped
from a bank dragging hundreds of
tonof dirt with it and exposing an
unusual stratum

  dr zednick stood stock-still
gasped and stared he said some-
thing pee wee didnt catch and
stepped closer then he turned and
glanced sharply at boyer pee wee
caught steves arm and whispered
wait your shadows just spotted
somethin in them layers of dirt
hes tremblin like a bird dog on a
point he called it some kind of a


street  smiths western story

word that sounded as if it meant
things a million years old

dr zednick wiped his fore-
head put on a pair of glasses
and continued to look at the
stratum in a fascinated manner

  hes goin to start purrin in a
minute paddy whispered
danged if i can see anything but
dirt stones and somethin that looks
like a tin nugget

  suddenly dr zednicky attitude
changed lie whirled scowled at
boyer then his eyes narrowed
bah he snorted bah

  black sheep have you any
wool paddy chuckled this is
goin to be good a fight between
two sissy anthro    anthrop   
grave-diggers

  fraud impostor zednick
raged so youre an anthropolo-
gist boyer

  yvhore you talking to boyer
demanded

  you zednick shouted one
of the greatest discoveries in its field
in years and you dont even see it
and all the time youve been trying
to cut in ahead of me amateur
you might have ruined an impor-
tant discovery with your blunder-
ing the very thought seemed to
make him white with rage

 why damn you boyer
shouted calling me a fraud
lie looked at the stratum but could
see nothing and he knew he was
trapped but he decided to bluff it
through pie made his way through
the mass of snow and muck to the
stratum saw a piece of fossilized
bone protruding and started to
heave away on it

  zednick took off his glasses and
carefully tucked them into his
pocket he walked over to boyer
drop that he said thickly drop
it

  boyer whirled and let fly with his
fist zednick ducked the blow but
the second one caught him squarely
 the nose then they were at it
sometimes they were in the mud
rolling over sometimes standing up
zednick was the smaller lighter and
older of the two but his fury offset
boyers physical advantage he
never let boyer get set and pres-
ently boyer began retreating he
looked around wildly for a club

  it was then that pee wee stepped
in fight fair you he ordered
im refereein this brawl

  nobody asked you to boyer
snarled

  im asking you now zednick
shouted he knocked boyer down
and the latter got up again zed-
nick had found a combination that
worked remember your prom-
ise he yelled at steve you said
if i showed this man to be a fraud
id be given the ice man he made
the mistake of looking at steve and
boyer nailed him

  zednick went down and boyer
started to kick him in the stomach
pee wee shoved him back zed-
nick got up and went after boyer
both were tiring and their punches
lacked steam but boyer was dis-
couraged and zednick wasnt then
boyer went down and didnt get up

  anthropologist fighter bah 
zednick panted his knees buckled
but he managed to remain upright
until he found a rock to sit on

  the winner and still champion
steve shouted and the owner of
the ice man-raw meat zednick

  then steve turned to boyer who
was getting up slowly youre a
fake boyer he said sternly im
sure of that now thanks to dr zed-
nick paddy take this cuss into the
brush where he cant be seen if
he opens his mouth knock him cold
dr zednick you get out of sight
dark frontier



pee wee leg it up to boyers head-
quarters mobilize his grave diggers
and tell em their boss has made a
great discovery well find out
whether thevre anthropologists or
not

  everyone complied with enthusi-
asm boyers men eyes alert for
danger muscles tense followed pee
wee to the slide

  all right boys steve said
heres a great discovery-the story
of this country when it was the dark
frontier hop to it get your speci-
mens before another slide comes
down and covers things up

mcgraw-page men had fol-
lowed the boyer group down
and were standing around trying to
decide what was going on the
boyer men approached the slide and
studied the dirt asked questions an-
swered them and tried to carry out
a bluff

  heres tin nuggets one said
when the silence grew painful it
was the only reaction

  its no use boys steve said
you arent up to it but i admire
you for trying paddy bring the
professor here when boyer was
brought up steve continued
youre all wearing the brock-bul-
lock brand get your things and
start hoofing it down the river
hold on boyer protested hotly
you cant do that we cant get
across the place you blew up and-
well get you over that steve
told him the rest of the ice is
safe a little mushy in spots
maybe but in better shape than
when we made it up here

  the mcgraw-page men herded
the others back to their cabins and
shacks and gave them time to pack
up personal belongings a weeks
grub and sleeping bags dorothy
sheldon came out in the midst of

it whats wrong steve she
asked

  cleaning out the brock-bullock
bunch steve said briefly the
professor is going and i suppose his
secretary had better go along too
she looked at him quietly but
made no protest

  aw steve let her stay if she
wants to pee wee pleaded

  no dice pee wee steve said
shes been in the thick of this with
the others

  youre right there dorothy
told him in a low tone youd be
astonished if you knew just how
much ive been in all this in more
ways than one some day- oh
well she shrugged and turned
away

  good-by steve said for a mo-
ment he almost faltered then he
put personal feelings aside as he had
done from the beginning youre
going down on a tractor he in-
formed the waiting men pile on
he waved his hand toward the sleds

  the tractor stopped at paddy
creek picked up several long
planks then continued on to the
break in the ice steve thrust the
planks over the spots where the ice
seemed thickest then tested them
they held up but he ran a hand
rope across as an added precaution

  grasping the rope the bullock
men and dorothy crossed the break
one at a time they gathered on
the lower side picked up their be-
longings and started off the rest
of the way was a matter of hiking
steve waited until they were out of
sight then he picked up the planks
thats that he said but it isnt
the end of the fight

  it kind o hurts pee wee said
to think dorothy was a spy all the
time i always figgered she was one
of us i told her plenty

  so did i paddy said but


street  smiths western story

steve kept his trap closed ill bet
you

  no not always steve said qui-
etly now that i look back there
were times when it seemed i was
ready to open it and dorothy closed
it for me

chapter xviii

ice jam

dr zednick was apologetic
when steve and the others re-
turned to page city i made a
regular savage of myself he said
i dont know why i lost my tem-
per so completely

  dont worry about it pee wee
told him ive a new respect for
college doctors you certainly
showed boyer up me and steve
dont know anything of the fine
points of your work there was
times when he didnt ring true but
we didnt know he was puttin over
a bullock trick he mustve been
the one who dug the ice pit for the
dredge

  who else steve asked dr
zednick well show our appreciation
by calling you if we see anything
that looks like dark-frontier evi-
dence naturally the most impor-
tant thing to us is to mine but well
try to co-operate with you as much
as we can

  the anthropologist thanked him
profusely then steve gathered his
force together

  theres work to be done he
told them between now and the
next freeze-up

  where the sun beat down hard
near the bench the ground was
thawing steadily some time in the
distant future this would be dredg-
ing ground and steve was anxious
to clear away the portion above
high-water level as soon as possible

  the creek which he had explored
the previous summer was frozen to

the gravel but melting snow water
was tumbling over the falls and run-
ning over the surface that indi-
cated that plenty of water was in
the lake above the falls steves men
had installed a pipe line from the
lake carried it along the bluff above
the bench then dropped it to the
bench proper

  steve ordered a monitor con-
nected to the pipe line and the water
turned on the results brought
broad grins to the faces of steve
pee wee and the alaskan miners
they had included in their gang

  a jet of water two hundred feet
long shot from the nozzle and
knocked sod dirt and small stones
into the air a skilled man han-
dling the stream could undermine
small boulders and keep them mov-
ing

 the men moved the stream
slowly clearing everything down to
the frost line and knocking out pro-
truding objects the dirt carried
by the flood flowed into the sluice
boxes and spilled onto the river ice

  disposal of the tailings brought a
smile to steves face sometimes
the costs of tailing disposal eats
deeply into the profits here every-
thing would be carried down to
schooner bay with each break-up
and during the high-water season

 men moved slowly along the
sluice boxes dislodging boulders
that had jammed dr zednick was
working on the slope exposed by the
slide he had found part of a mas-
todon bone and was excavating in
the hope of finding the remainder of
the skeleton

  zednick had converted a couple
of fuel-oil drums into boilers and
was thawing ground he was so ab-
sorbed in his task that steve had to
remind him he had better shift food
for several days from page city to
the scene of operations
  when the break-up comes
steve warned we wont be able to
cross the stream for several days
when things quiet down ill build
a bridge

steve held clean-ups frequently
sacking the tin nuggets and
caching them well above high-water
mark it was necessary to shift the
monitor often for the ground had
thawed but a few inches the pipe
line was extended and carried close
to the bluff but on the bench this
brought it under zednicks opera-
tion

   cover it up steve said dont
 try to keep the pipe clear i doubt
 if we move the line unless we make
 a big shift and run out of pipe

   there was a stub nearby fitted
with a valve and zednick kept this
clear of muck and it was well that
he did so the climax steve had
felt was certain to take place was
rapidly approaching so far as he
knew every man in the vicinity was
a hundred percent loyal he had
even made quiet tests of zednicks
men there was no doubt of it
every man was an experienced an-
thropologist enthusiastic about zed-
nick and his work

   steve made a quick trip down to
paddy creek cabin and found no
evidence of recent visits he swung
over creeks ready to go out and
found nothing to arouse his suspi-
cions he returned to page city
wading through water in the upper
canyon it must be plain nerves
he told himself ruefully

  paddy had ed on the monitor
nozzle when steve arrived on the
job it was tough work even
though the nozzle moved on a ball-
bearing assembly the pressure had
a tendency to whip the nozzle
about

   weve just about stripped this
ground paddy reported whatll
we do make another shift or wait

 still the break-up is over and we
 know where we stand

   wait it wont be long now
 warm winds and rains will move the
 ice steve predicted how much
 tin have we got

   a ton paddy reported now
 if that was only gold

    theres more tin though steve
  consoled him turn the stream
  into that bluff just below the high
  part of the bench well prospect
  the ground afterward and see what
  its got

   the stream hit the bench well
 down cut a trench into the frost
 line then moved slowly upward
 presently a mass tumbled ed kept
 the water eating into the mass

    let me have it steve said he
  had hydraulicked thousands of cu-
  bic yards before he was twenty and
  had learned a few tricks he kept
  large masses moving everything
  fell away leaving a sheer wall of
  frozen gravel a hundred feet high
  then steve saw something curved
  and dark protruding from the wall
  and turned the stream aside

   get zednick steve yelled
 hop ed dont stand there gap-
 ing

    youre gaping too ed snapped
  showing more spirit than steve had
  seen in him in a long time

   water had stopped running by
 the time zednick and his men came
 panting up there were pools
 masses of muck and muddy boul-
 ders scattered all the way to the
 sluice boxes several tin nuggets as
 large as a mans head were visible
 but none of the scientists paid the
 metal the slightest attention

   mastodon tusk zednick said
 and in fine state of preservation
 he could hardly talk a ladder
 boys hurry

the things been there thousands
of years pee wee observed and
now you fellers are in a hurry
the ladder was brought and zed-
 nick climbed up no doubt of it
dark frontier



lie said i wonder if in that ice
and gravel well find a perfectly pre-
served mastodon im afraid even
to dream it

  according to legend steve said
one came down an ice jam turn-
ing the river might have washed out
the bank and released it as it did
the ice man

  we shift our operations here
zednick declared the other can
wait

steve left zednick and his men
working on the mastodon and
checked on power creek an ice
jam had formed in the canyon
above the falls and he decided to
cash in on it a few cases of pow-
der started a slide that almost filled
the canyon the intake to his wa-
ter supply was beyond the slide and
unless the run-off was too great and
water poured over the slide washing
it out he was assured of a seasons
water supply

  things are goin pretty slick
pee wee said zednicks got his
break youve got yours in all the
water you need in a few days
power creek ice will go out then
you can put the dredge to work
hadnt we better move it onto the
job

  no steve answered well
leave it where it is until after the
break-up they had left the dredge
 the south side of the south fork
on a low bench a quarter mile from
power creek there were no signs
that water had ever reached that
level in recent years and steve felt
it was safe

  they did turn water into the
powerhouse turbines and the elec-
trician who had installed the small
plant during the winter made his
first practical tests for the first
time electric lights glowed on the
dark frontier

  the electrician was as interested
and enthusiastic as the rest of them
everything o k he announced
now all we need is the break-up
and then we can clean up and i
aint tryin to be funny steve
nodded and went outside

  boss seems down in the dumps
the electrician remarked seems
like hes fearin the worst i reckon
he misses dorothy sheldon

  he sure is on edge pee wee
agreed but he wasnt sure doro-
thy was responsible steve appre-
ciated bullocks uncanny ability to
snatch an eleventh-hour victory
and he had discussed the matter
with pee wee many times of late
the latter knew steves chief con-
cern was the possible loophole he
might have failed to plug

  the flow of water over the south
fork had increased during their in-
spection several very small creeks
emptying into power creek were
now flooding its ice to a depth of
several inches and steve concluded
it was no longer safe to use the
south fork ice in reaching page
city

  everyone ate in the tent cook-
house they had erected near the
monitor after the evening meal
they sat around and listened to the
gradually increasing mutter of the
water

  by morning steve predicted
itll be a roar

  after months of dead silence the
sound of water was welcome but it
awakened them at four the follow-
ing morning the ice was tumbling
through the south fork and those
in page city signaled that the
north fork ice was beginning to go
out too

  everyone dressed wolfed down
something to eat drank hot coffee
and hurried down to the river bank
to those who hadnt seen it it was


street  smiths western story

a stirring sight to those who had
it was almost as thrilling

  rivers just getting warmed up
to the subject steve said in a
couple of hours youll see real ac-
tion

  even dr zednick had left his be-
loved mastodon and was staring
fascinated by the spectacle paddy
started to climb down the bank but
steve grabbed him by the collar and
hauled him back again trying to
commit suicide he demanded

  i saw a piece of tree paddy
said and it had ax marks on it

  how could it

  thats just what im wonderin
paddy declared theres another
hunk of wood its gone sucked
under they watched and pres-
ently saw splinters trees didnt
last long with the ice grinding away

  the river was jammed now the
water high and the ice piling up
slabs fifty feet in diameter turned
slowly and on edge like three-foot-
thick cartwheels some would jam
and break off others would move
on shattering smaller slabs the
roar was tremendous and men
shouted to make themselves heard

across the fork those in page
city had lined the bank and
were watching the volume in-
creased until some of the slabs were
higher than the bank itself they
swept along striking the edge of
the bank ripping off rocks and
blocks of half-frozen sod and gravel

  paddy suddenly jumped down
leaped to a cake and gave a mighty
heave both hands were clutching
the stub of a limb the ice shifted
and he brought out a two-foot
length of tree the upper portion
chewed to a pulp by the ice the
lower showing ax marks

  he struggled to the bank with it
and pee wee lifted him up

  no doubt of it steve said
theyre ax marks if this were the
north fork and the wood older id
say it was a souvenir of jerry page
and sam tafts operations but the
wood is freshly cut someone is up
that canyon

  maybe a trapper over from the
upper country zednick suggested
we know no one passed through
here

  the day slipped by before they
knew it everyone turned in late
only to be awakened at two oclock
by a diminishing in the grind of ice
steve and pee wree ran down the
river was dropping rapidly ice
was stranding everywhere an hour
later the flow increased until the
banks almost overflowed

  they returned to bed but the si-
lence came again at five oclock
water in the south fork was a tenth
of normal the largest flow coming
from power creek

  theres a jam up the canyon
pee wee declared and its a honey
to stop the river like that

  weve got to break it steve de-
clared how much powder have
we left

  plenty wte used some to blast
the ice downstream pee wee an-
swered if we can shatter the key
ice in the jam pressure will do the
rest it dropped down to freezing
last night which means its colder
higher up that should tighten up
the run-off and help us that much
steve called his men together and
asked for volunteers im not or-
dring any man into that canyon
he said no married men can go
either if the ice lets go its cur-
tains no need of kidding ourselves
he looked at ed but the man would
not meet his eyes

  there were plenty of volunteers
however steve led the way to the
powder cache when each was
loaded he outlined his plan of ac-
tion itll be a case of crawling
into holes and out again most of the
time he explained again we
can jump from slab to slab but
its risky business and watch out
for small pieces thatll drop you into
the water well keep pretty well
apart just in case somebody slips
and his powder goes off

make ed go pee wee urged
he might fold up on us pass
out from fright steve explained
then wed have to pack him out
i cant take that chance

  im glad his old man isnt here
to see it pee wee said there
was a man id go to hell for

  and maybe thats just what
youre doing pee wee steve said
the final plan of action was clear
in his own mind he would check
on the time consumed going up and
allow that much for the return he
would send the others out and when
the time had nearly elapsed he
would light the fuse and try to race
back before the ice let go

  they plodded steadily and in sin-
gle file a short distance and sud-
denly a rifle cracked too close at
hand for comfort steve stopped
dead in his tracks as the bullet
kicked up the muck a couple of
yards ahead of him

  i got him spotted pee wee said
in a low voice hes up there in
the first tunnel zednick drove into
the bluff

steve turned and saw a mans
face in the vague light he no-
ticed the man had built a protective
mound of rocks across the tunnel
mouth looking the other way
steve realized the man commanded
the canyon mouth he turned his
gaze back to the man again

  mcgraw youre in a jackpot
the man shouted the first man
startin up that canyon gets a -
bullet in the dynamite hes carryin

we had one hell of a time jammin
that ice but there she is just keep
your shirts on gents and itll break
of its own accord-when theres
enough water behind it

  pee wee looked at the tunnel cu-
riously two or three guys up
there could hold off an army you
cant attack em from in front or
behind or any other way and if
we dont get rid of em and hurry
up and blow the dam when she does
let go- he shook his head and
shrugged his shoulders

  they all knew what would hap-
pen when the jam finally let go a
wall of water a hundred feet high
and perhaps several miles long
would be released and as the flood
burst from the canyon mouth it
would hurl thousands of tons of ice
at everything in its path dredge
townsite monitors and in fact ev-
erything not carried to high points
would be lost

 looking across to page city
steve could see that the men over
there had already sized up the situa-
tion they were beginning to move
food and supplies to higher ground

  the first thing theyre takin is
them skin boats you brought up
steve pee wee said figger well
need em to get out of the country
after the flood

  steve didnt hear he was admit-
ting to himself reluctantly that his
men could neither get up the can-
yon nor shoot the bullock men in
the tunnel

  you know youre licked the
man jeered waving the rifle barrel
back and forth better make up
your mind what youre goin to do
next

  i have steve answered

forty years and more than  people in all parts

venient money-saving way they have studied the

eiano violin guitar accordion and in short every
iud of popular instrument

many of these pupils did not know one musical note
from another when they enrolled many had previ-
ously tried other methods of instruction without suc-
cess and not a few were frankly skeptical they
doubted whether it was possible to learn music by

the surprise of their lives when they actually heard
themselves playing simple popular melodies at tirst
then more and more advanced pieces all the way to

pleasure they found in the lessons they say it was

derstand that with all the wonderful photographs

easy fascinating way
