the waxdejutr returned

what 

 dr sheldon readjusted his
 glasses an d took another arid
 more prolonged look at the
 card in his hand

 henry  randall  he cried more

softly  well ill be--

 jest there he stopped for the maid
 was watching him with slightly elevated
 eyebrows she was a very prim and
 satisfactory maid too and there seemed
 no use risking her nerves by the undue
 use of joyous profanity therefore the
 doctor concluded

  well tell him to come right in
 helen

 there are two geodemen in the
waiting-room sir theyve been there
ten or fifteen minutes

  eh  the doctor had jost come up
 from a late breakfast  nothing the
 matter with them apparently 

 no sir bet they gave me their

cards and-

  all right bring em in when mr
 randall leaves then sheldon ordered
  he wont be here long show him in

 two minutes later he dropped ran-
 dalls hand with a final grip and re-
 turned to his chair with an approving
 grin

  so youre actually back at last and
 as suddenly and unexpectedly as you left
 henry  be said  sit down

  well i only dropped in for a mo-
 ment randall hesitated  theres
 some one ahead of me the maid said

  sit down  

the approval grew as the doctor sur-

 on the street-level

eyed his visitor scon ritks
clean-cut face of a mav the shades
thirty the powerful lines o-r came off
body that has profited by mud to shel-
lord henry sis mcnths a a
ging around hasnt injured yon  iner
brown as a nut and-yes all of fift-vi
pounds heavier arent you 

   about that randall laughed
yes a jaunt around the world is a bit
cf a freshener tom ive made pretty
certain of that

   just where did you go  

   from here to england randall
soiled  from england to south
africa from there to holland-to
england-and home again r

   and yon landed 

   last night said randall hew
has the world been treating you kill-
ing off the population as successfully as
ever 

  sheldon did not answer immediately
he locked steadily at the other and a
strong light cf curiosity came into his
eyes

   did you-get it   he said softly

   the-the diamond i went after 
randall started slightly and lowered his
voice  i-why of coarse

  randall merely soiled oddly nodded
and remained silent the doctor pursed
his lips and just the slightest hint of
a frown appeared

   henry he said in low tones
youve known me for twenty years or
v and you know that im nt given to
prying ini

peoples affairs-yours less

   but at the same time when a man
starts off as you did half a year ago
without warning or ar-narent reason

    i suppose not the

   h twinkling eyes if i tell
   truth can you contain it for
   -four hours

    twenty-four years  sheldon an-
ounced  hand out the tale henry
and end the suspense 

   well all right randall glanced
toward the door and drew his chair to
the doctors side  ill put it in half a
dozen words then and skip on cfc-wn-
town tom its not an overwhelming
mystery you know

  one hand wen with a queer furtive
motion toward his left armpit rardal
drew breath and began

for a stan just three days before
i saw you last a gentleman by the name
of gardner was ushered into my private
osce in the jewelry store down-town
 wlsch gardner 

   p e

   phew  sheldon opened his eyes
 the one with the large large bank-
account eh 

   yes the millionaire well he closed
the door and sat down and informed me
that he had done business with my father
in the same store thirty years agj that
he understood i had inherited the sti re
and was carrying on business as usual
and that he believed i was one of the
diamond experts of new york i in-
timated that he had pretty nearly hit the
nail on the head and invited him to pro-
ceed

   he did a year ago next month
you know he married miss marjorie
pelton the society beauty a lady about a
quarter of a century younger than him-
self hes pretty well convinced that the

sun rises and sets for her especial benefit

and rice vtrsa

   at any rate he wished to make her

a little gift on the first anniversary of
their marriage and he wanted to prepare
for it ahead of time in short he wished
to misult me about obtaining the largest

i ssible single diamond 

   aha  observed sheldon

   well ive been digging a pretty fair
profit out of new yorks fashionable
set randall chuckled  but i can tell
yon my heart wanned to that son of
customer i ran over several stones that
i had in mind for his benefit

   there was one perfect peach of a
diamond i could have bought for about
twenty thousand and another that forty-
five might have taken  and-er some-
where within a dozen miles-there is a
perfect old-fashioned bouncer that might
be acquired for eighty-five or ninety
thousand dollars

   great scott  

   that was what i thought hed say
but he didnt gardners a good spon
tom he merely asked whether there
wasnt something fe-gcr to be had

   that rather staggered me for a little
while but it set me thinking harder in
the end i went the limit and told him
that the largest diamond of which i had
any inside knowledge was a certain tre-
mendous chunk of r ck not as yet wholly
at and recently mined in south africa
known as the great gordon

   what it could be bought for if at
all i couldnt say certainly it was one
of the biggest stones in the world an 
the only really abnormally big one any -
where near being on the market

   gardner simply nodded inquired if
i would leave at once personally under-
take the buying and cutting of the great
gordon and bring it bark here in time
to be set for the anniversary i con-
sidered it for just five minutes atid
agreed there was something about that
deal too fascinating too infernally profit-
able too altogether absurd to resist

   he invited me to meet him at his
bankers on the following morning to
arrange letters of credit and an unlimited
cash-supply thereafter i was to leave
as soon as possible accomplish the mis-
sion and get back i did it there i-
the whole story
the going of the gordon

   with the exception of about nine-
tenths of it sheldon commented while
his face betrayed his lively interest
 you must have had worries and respon-
sibilities and adventures by the ton

   dozens of them randall smiled
easily  there were several rows before
i acquired the stone at all there was a
secret night-departure from the mine that
would put a dime novel in the shade 
there was an isolated brigand on the
coast who forced me to demonstrate how
fast an automatic pistol can work when
it gets wanned through all that sort of
thing

   well im off ill raise your hair
with stories of the trip when weve both
more time just now im slightly anx-
ious to get the great gordon into the big
vault and put a guard outside

  you have it with you escaped ex-
citedly from the doctor

   i-iush  randall said sharply  of
course i have you dont suppose i ship
the thing around in a trunk do you
except for the time when it was in the
hands of the diamond-cutters it hasnt
left me once well-

  he held out his hand in farewell
sheldon ignored it he rose and stood
beside the jeweler and there was rather
a remarkable quality in his gaze

   henry  he almost whispered  let
me see that stone 

  what

  do it the doctor urged ive
never seen a diamond of that kind and
you have increased any previous curiosity
about a thousandfold let me have just
one glimpse of it 

   but my dear fellow- randall

broke off

  if his smile was not annoyed it was
at least somewhat puzzled

   you know this whole affair is a
regular dyed-in-the-wool secret even
from mrs gardner only gardner him-
self pelton his brother-in-law and i
are aware that the stone is on my
person

   well im not going to publish the
fact just let me have one look at a
stone thats worth-how much is it
worth  

   away up in six figures said ran-
dall absently  i dont know i sup-
pose it wouldnt do any particular harm



but ive gualed the thing so carefully
all along the line

  sheldon walked across the room and
locked the door he returned and stood
expectantly before the jeweler hands in
pockets randall contemplating the
eager expression finally sighed resign-
edly

   well its a fool thing to do i sup-
pose and its rather a silly thing to re-
fuse but- say pull down those

shades tom 

   no one can see in here

   look here were on the street-level
and im not taking any risks

  the doctor obeyed briskly the shades
came down and randalls coat came off
and his vest as well somewhat to shel-
dons bewilderment the jeweler began a
rather lengthy expedition into the inner
recesses of his apparel his right hand
groped and groped in the region of his
left armpit

  he grunted a little and twisted at
something he groped farther and still
farther

  in the end he grunted again with ap-
parent satisfaction this time and re-
gained his coat and vest in his hand
he held up a rather unique contrivance
and sheldon after a moments study be-
came enlightened

  it was an odd affair in its way the
product of randalls ingenuity and a
cape town harness-makers craft there
was a short stout strap ta buckle
over the shoulder there was another
crossing it and sewed hard to it which
was obviously meant to encircle the upper
arm between the two a pouch was fas-
tened so placed as to hang under the
arm all in all it was a jewel-pouch
with a degree of secure anchorage

   my own invention said randall
softly  when this affairs over im
going to patent it and make a million
or two on my own account well-sure
that doors locked

   yes said sheldon rather breath-
lessly

  in the darkened room he watched
tensely as the jeweler opened the mouth
of the pouch he hardly breathed as a
velvet bag came forth but he gasped
aloud when there rolled to his desk a
gleaming glittering diamond of size
hardly conceivable
going to own-to wear that  lie cried
 such seems to be the plan

  randall lingered nervously over the
thing his fingers fairly twitched as the
doctor raised the stone and looked at it
wide-eyed and startled beyond words at
the immensity and brilliancy of the gem
he let a sharp breath of relief escape as
sheldons fingers positively cold now re-
turned the crystal fortune

  in a matter of possibly two seconds
the great gordon was returned to its
bag and the bag to the pouch and shel-
don shook his head dazedly

   its the-the most tremendous thing
of the kind i ever dreamed of  he said
 i-why its worth half a dozen for-
tunes henry 

   well what i handed the customs
people alone yesterday afternoon would
keep one or two families in comfort for
a while randall muttered thoughtfully

   i declared it for even every cent its
worth for the sake of getting her through
in a hurry and with as little excitement
as possible well now im off in earnest
tom

   going to put it back 

   um-no   randall considered for
a moment  ill strap it around my
wrist and-eh  

  there was a sharp knock at the door
randall clutching his treasure turned
swiftly the doctor hurriedly threw up
the shades and in a twinkling his bewil-
derment vanished and his professional
calm returned

  he opened the door to confront the
maid and hear

   the gentlemen sir that are waiting
they sent in their cards and said theyd
drop in another time if you were still
busy

  well-hello sheldon turned to
his visitor with a smile  one of the
waiting ones is mr fenway pelton
henry 

  mrs gardners brother

   the same person hes one of my
patients

   and hes growing impatient  a
hearty voice in the corridor announced
 alone yet 

   going to be now laughed the doc-
tor  theres a-an acquaintance of
yours in here mr pelton

for a second randall scowled his
frank annoyance down the corridor
steps were coming in another moment
gardners own brother-in-law would be
in the room and there he was standing
with the great gordon in his hand at
the very least the fact that sheldon had
had the first view of it would be obvious

  rapidly he thrust it into the side
pocket of his coat just as the tall broad
and immaculately fashionable figure of
mr fenway pelton came through the
door

   doctor  want to introduce mr
david lane he said  hes troubled
with a few of the things you specialize

i believe and- hello randall 

  he crossed to the jeweler as the slen-
der rather pale man behind him shook
hands with the physician

  by george youre looking well
randall  he cried  diamond-chasing
seems to agree with you 

  he drew off his gloves and said more
softly

   so you did get her here safely i
imagine philip was a little relieved when
you phoned him last night that you were
actually ashore with the thing

 i wasnt particularly sorry myself
 no i fancy not pelton dropped
into a chair and stretched his long legs
where is she now locked up down-
town i suppose

   just at the moment the great gor-
don diamond is in my hand in this
pocket

   phew  pelton opened his eyes
somewhat  you dont mind lugging
fortunes around do you still i sup-
pose jewels dont impress you much more
than greenbacks do the bank-teller

   perhaps not randall smiled
rather thankful for the suggestion  i
try to take pretty good care of them
though

  pelton nodded and stretched the fin-
gers of his gloves thoughtfully the
doctor and lane crossed to them and
randall prepared for the third time to
make for the comforting depths of his
own big vault farther down-town

  again he was to be halted however
for pelton looked up suddenly

   i say doctor-and you too lane-
youre not addicted to talking about
things that are not to be mentioned no

popped from his head one violently

on sheldons desk

  the space was wholly blank

   ihe great gordon pouch straps and
all had disappeared

chapter ii

an apparent evanescence

  if old mr frothingham had actually
opened operations bv tearing down the
ceiling the shock would have been rather
gentler

  the four men stared at one another in
thunderstruck silence for a matter of
minutes a remarkable sound half groan
half wail escaped randall

   it was sheldon who first regained his
wits however he shook himself to-
gether and laughed-and the spell broke

   the thing hasnt walked out of the
room you know he said  it may be
a remarkable sort of stone but it hasnt
legs

   but it was-jvas there it was lying
right there tom and-and- ran-
dall mouthed incoherently

   yes and now it is lying somewhere
within three feet of there  said shel-
don with a good deal of briskness as
he crossed the office and threw up the
shades once more

  with the coming of more light four
highly interested pairs of eyes centered
on the desk they as well might have
centered on the chandelier or the mantel
or the door-knob

   typically neat as all his other posses-
sions the flat expanse of sheldons desk-
top held nothing unnecessary it revealed
a small ink-well a prescription-pad a
book or two-and nothing more

    well it slid off the desk then   said
the doctor with a note of impatience in
his voice  in the excitement over
frothingham one of you must have jarred
the desk or the pad or something of the
sort

   i dont think any of us were near
enough to touch the desk doctor said
iane

    and if that were the case why isnt
the pad crooked now asked the jew-
eler excitedly

   eh  why-tord i dont know

maybe me of you brushed it off with his
coat whe turning some of you look on
that side

  the iloeutrdropped to his knees and
searched the rug it was rather an un-
necessary proceeding for the leather con-
trivance could have been seen plainly the
length of the room but in the excitement
the physicians nose went almost to the
carpet

  ill ere and there he moved searching
energetically he moved chairs he
peered under the table he looked even
into the entirely empty fireplace

  in the end he rose with a puzzled
grunt

    its over that side  he observed

  pelton also stood erect and randall
with him

    there isnt a sign of it here shel-
don   said the former

  no not a sign not the first
sign  the jeweler cried wildly

   do you mean to say that that dia-
mond isnt on the floor within two feet
of you the doctor exclaimed in some
bewilderment  why bosh it must
be let me look

  he came quickly around the desk and
his sharp eyes ran across the floor it
was a search of painful simplicity and
quite as fruitless as the one he had just
completed

  from side to side from corner to
corner of the office practically every
inch of floor was visible an object the
size of a thimble would have been in-
stantly perceptible there was no indi
cation of the great gordon

  sheldon scratched his head and
frowned for an instant

  well here then he said its
gone under the desk-thats all one of
you take hold there please yes thats
right well move it away from the wall
altogether and carry it into the center
of the room thats it

  randall was on his knees again as the
desk rose and was moved away breath-
ing hard he craned forward eagerly
and some two or three seconds later he
sank back somewhat limply

    it isnt there he announced

   what 

    not a trace of it 

   can-can we have dragged it along
under the desk sheldon suggested
the going ok the gordon



perhaps the confounded things caught
in the bottom part

  his hands closed on the desk and
tilted it upward bodily the three
crouched together for a view three
heads shook together

   nothing doing sheldon felton re-
marked

  the doctor stared blankly at him

  he rolled the desk back to its old
place and perched on top  and for a little
he looked at the trio in silence ex-
treme bewilderment was written upon
two of those faces bewilderment and
horror on the third sheldon began to
feel peculiarly as he faced the problem

   gentlemen he said  im not ad-
dicted to profanity but id unhesitating-
ly pronounce this about the damnedest
happening on record

  randall was gathering his courage it
seemed he looked from one to the
other and suddenly his uppermost
thought crystallized into words

   i-i he said uncertainly- i
dont like to say it but this-this matter

seems to lie between the three-

  he stopped and reddened a little

   eh sheldons eyes opened and a
faint smile appeared on his lips  dont
be absurd henry youre excited and
all that sort of thing but dont begin by
accusing us

   but that stone never-

   henry  said the doctor with a
sharp snap of his fingers do you be-
lieve me capable of stealing that or any
other diamond

  the men faced each other and ran-
dall surrendered suddenly

   frankly tom i know you didnt 
he muttered

   all right pass on to mr pelton
then hes mrs gardners brother for
one thing for another he hardly needs

the stone as for mr lane-

   ill vouch for dave lane said
pelton with a grave smile  ive
known him ar fifteen years randall
the doctor nodded

   therefore henry gather your wits
together if there was a stranger heri-
or if any one else had even been in the
room theft might have been a possibility
as it is weve got to face the situation
and sit down and reason out just where
that infernal stone is

  he set the example and found a cigar

  lets see what do we know about
it he went on thoughtfully  it was
on the desk for one thing who laid
it there 

   i did said pelton

   and you had not touched it
henry 

   i was just going to pick it up when
that old man arrived tom

   but vou hadnt laid hands on it  

   no

   and when frothingham came to the
door you all turned toward it if i re-
member right

   yes

   and when you turned back a sec-
ond or so later the thing was gone
humph 

  sheldon stared at the wall behind the
desk and whistled a bar or two

   well bv george it passes me if
there was a trap-door in that wall or an
open chimney within reaching distance
id almost say that some insanely intel-
ligent person had gathered it in

  he ended with another shake of the
head

   as it is groaned randall  the
great gordon is simply gone

   well it hasnt gone into thin air
sheldon pursued dryly  we know
that much anyway sole-leather doesnt
vaporize at any rate um henry is
it possible that you may have picked it
up and thrust it into one of your pockets
when the door opened subconscious
cerebration you know

  do you suppose i shouldnt have
found it out by this time randall
cried running hopelessly through his
pockets  no

  one of you gentlemen then

   not i certainly said lane with
an uneasy laugh as he rummaged
through the various receptacles of his
person  no doctor theres nothing
of the sort here and furthermore i mav
say that on account of its huge value i
hesitated at even touching the gem when
mr pelton offered it to me for inspec-
tion

   and you mr pelton

  pelton had removed his gloves again
and was running through his pockets

   im afraid that i shall have to spoil
your theory sheldon he said  i cer-


the all-story magazine

tainly did not touch the great gordon
after piadng it on the desk

  the doctor frowning again investi-
gated his own person lie ended by
throwing up his hands with a helpless
gesture

   not here either  he looked from
one to the other of them and exclaimed
good lord im nut a detective or
an analyst of this sort of freak happen-
ing hasnt one of you a suggestion to
offer  

  blank staring silence was his only
answer the doctor chewed his cigar
meditatively and looked around the floor
again it was as empty of diamond as
his own brain of a solution of the mys-
tery

   young woman  came from the ad-
joining room in a thin cracked voice

   frothingham  muttered the doctor

   young woman come here i say
positively i must insist that you inform
the doctor at once that i am waiting
here and suffering

  sheldon rose slowly

   gentlemen im afraid that i shall
have to ask you to step into the waiting-
room for half an hour or so mr
frothingham has evidently gone his
limit hell he in here in a moment

   well i think i wont wait shel-
don said pelton  i have a number
of things to attend to this morning with
mr lane f

  he too arose and lane with him
and upon the latters face was a degree
of perplexity

   mr randall he said slowly
 this-this has been a most remarkable
a most unfortunate occurrence i-
well i quite understand that in your
mind at least a certain degree of sus-
picion must rest upon all three of us
before leaving the room i wish very
much indeed that you personally would
make a thorough search of me

  pelton nodded approval

   good scheme dave go ahead
with it randall it is the best plan all
around 

   and count me in on it added the
doctor as he removed his coat and held
it forth for a beginning

  randall faced them with a weak smile

   do you suppose for a moment that
im going to do anything so absurd un-

der the circumstances and particularly
in the face o a plain invitation i
am bound to confess gentlemen that i
cant conceive any of you taking the
great jordon if for no other reason
than that none of you had the oppor-
tunity to do it

   but nevertheless mr randall
lane insisted  it is due to us as much
as to yourself if you will be kind
enough to begin with me our times
a little limited and the old gentleman
seems to be uneasy

   im not going to search you  the
jeweler cried almost impatiently  it
is fair and square of you to suggest it
but-im not going to do it

  he turned to sheldon  good-by
tom

   good-by old man im infernally
sorry

   thank you and you will keep it
quiet for a little while at least

   of course but-

   and promise me another thing
randall said miserably  when you
get rid of the old chap in there make
another search of this room and as
thorough a one as you know how

   i certainly will ill tear the whole
place to pieces henry if i have to de-
vote the day to it if shes here ill
have her before noon and ill telephone
you

   thank you tom

  randalls voice was almost quivering
his head seemed to jump with every
pulse his feet scuffed weakly along the
hall behind the other two men

  it was only on the steps once more and
in the outer air that the full meaning of
his loss swept over him

  not half an hour ago he had walked
up those steps secure in the possession of
one of the worlds largest diamonds
cheerfully satisfied in the execution of a
commission that had netted him thou-
sands of dollars and considerable pres-
tige

  now he was walking out and-pel-
ton was speaking

   i didnt like to say it in there and
perhaps i shouldnt say it in lanes pres-
ence randall but i suppose you realize
that a pretty serious thing has occurred
this morning

   serious  burst from the jeweler
the going of the gordon



 do you suppose that it is possible for
any one to realize it more sironglv than
 do

   yes  peltons voice was decidedly
sharp  mr gardner for example is
likely to feel the loss quite as keenly
he has spent a fortune-and not a
small one-to secure the great gordon
fortunately having seen it myself i can
testify that you at least brought it into
the country but when he learns that the
stone has vanished  

  peltons aristocratic eyebrows went up
a trifle

  randall moistened his lips he too
had been considering that phase and in
a measure he was prepared his eyes
turned upon the other were fairly im-
ploring

    mr pelton he said huskily  if it
turns out-i cant believe it but if it
does turn out-that the stone has really
vanished for good all the reparation that
 can make will be made whether it
takes every dollar i have in the world
or not but until i can feel more cer-
tain that the great gordon is not going
to reappear may i ask that you keep the
affair a secret

  peltons eyebrows went higher

   my dear sir  he protested  gard-
ner is my brother-in-law you know
ill hardly be justified knowing what i
do in keeping quiet
t  i understand that but-but just for
a little time pelton just until i get
back my breath and-and am able to
take steps toward recovering the stone

  randall waited

  pelton tapped the pavement annoyedly
with his cane as they sauntered along
and his expression did not look alto-
gether hopeful for the jeweler

-	 thats-pshaw thats rather a
remarkable proposition you know ran-
dall i dont half like it gardner nat-
urally should know at once its a sort
of family treason for me even to contem-
plate keeping quiet too

    just for a little while 

  well for how long a period

   one week   hazarded randall

    urn 

  pelton stopped at the corner and
studied the curb in silence when he
faced randall it was with a doubtful
smile

   v ell-i  do that he said
 whatever sort of position it may put
me in i will say nothing for one week
but randall and his finger shook
menacingly at the very latest if you
should not get track of the diamond
you will make the disclosure yourself
one week from to-day

    yes

  a word from lane and they sepa-
rated randall watched them walk
away in something of a haze finally
he turned-half blindly to the car line
which would land him at the store

   gould it actually be possible that the
diamond was gone

  was he dreaming or was the great
gordon actually gone

   wasnt it some beastly hideous night-
mare from which he would awaken to
find the gem under his arm and the pis-
tol under his pillow as they had been
for so long

  his hand went up with the familiar
furtive motion no that sensation of
emptiness in his armpit had but too solid
foundation no thick little case was
there now it was all plain hard fact
he and the great gordon had parted
company randall turned from the
thought with a shudder he would have
to calm down first and try to analyze the
situation afterward

  like a gloomy ghost he entered his
own store for the first time in months

  the dozen or so clerks were amazed
once the genial employer with a nod
and a smile for every one randall
seemed to have returned from his pleas-
ure-trip a changed mortal his step was
leaden he saw no one even when
thorne his manager hurried forward
with outstretched hand he was hardly
aware of the presence

   into his private office at the rear he
went with a dull steadiness the desk
was just as he had left it the chairs in
the same position the books and the
catalogues on the shelves might never
have been out of his sight so familiar
were they the dream-aspect of the
affair returned with fresh strength as
he sank into his chair and threw up the
desk-top

  now he must settle down to business
must collect himself and brace himself

   theres a gentleman been waiting


the am story magazine

for ymi some minutes sir said thorne
from the doorway

   eh randalls head came up with
n jerk  who is it 

  its mr philip gardner sir

chapter iii

interviews ami dwucttons

  gardner

  of all people on the fare of the globe
whom randall did not wish to interview-
just then gardner was certainly the most
unwelcome

  for an instant the jeweler almost con-
templated precipitate flight by way of
the window then in the dire emer-
gency calm came over him rapidly
there was no earthly way of dodging
it gardner knew that he was there
gardner himself had appointed the inter-
view the uight before over the telephone
now he would haw to be faced

  plainly the truth would be out of the
question just then plainly also he
would have a somewhat difficult job in
concocting a suitable falxhood mean
while thorne was waiting and studying
his employer with frank curiosity and
randall said shortly

   show him in here thorne

  and now for it

  the jeweler sat rigid and listened
lie heard gardners big voice he
heard the heavy steps approaching along
the aisle like so many strokes of his
own business death-knell he heard the
millionaires hearty chuckle at something
and shuddered if he were not able to
brazen it out about how many minutes
more would gardner be chuckling

  but as the door opened again and
randall arose he felt with vast relief
and much surprise that his smile was
all it should have been he was aware
joyfully that the hand which shook the
millionaires no longer trembled and he
returned to his chair with a stilled sigh
of faint satisfaction

  gardner smiled approvingly at him
and with delicious irony summed up the
situation in

    so its itu right 

  randall almost caught his breath
and in spite of all the grim humor of the
remark brought a smile to his lips

   yes its  right  he assented

  have intich trouble buying it

   no more than i told you after i
secured it everything went smoothly

  have any bother with the customs
people  

   not a bit i put it through there
like a streak oj lightning hy the way
 have a balance of three or four thou-
sand dollars ahat till belong to you

  ah all right the fact of your
bringing in such a stone didnt leak out
anywhere did it

   no im sure it didnt

  randall was talking quickly and
thinking even more rapidly now lo-
calise of the latter condition silence
fell a hall-minute and it lmd become
uncomfortable silence gardner with a
little justice was waiting for something
and presently he announced the fact

   well lets have the first glimpse of
the wonder mr randall

  eh the jewelers eyes opened
in apparent astonishment  did you
want to see the great gordon this morn-
ing mr gardner

   whv of course 

 du you pshaw -

   what whats the matter gard-
ner asked quickly  isnt it all right
randall

   why the stone is perfectly safe of
course said the jeweler with the
sunvest of smiles  there were one or
two of the facets that needed just the
least trifle more polishing that is all 
took it down-town early this morning
and left it with the diumond-cutters

   per j telly safe there is it randall

    as safe as if it was locked in a treas-
ury-vault sir

  if a case must be made out of thin
air randall was impressed with the fact
that it had better lie made as strongly
as possible

   well will you take a run down with
me now for a look at the stone the
millionaire inquired suddenly

   eh  the jeweler wondered
whether insane horror were gleaming
from his eyes

   theres nothing to prevent is
there  

   certainly not i will go if youre
very anxious randall said siowlv
 but would yon not do better to wait
the going of the gordon



ancl see the stone in absolute perfection
mr gardner the great gordon is a
magnificently beautiful gem i should
very much advise waiting until it is in
the finest possible shape

   and how long will the cutting
take 

   it will be returned one week from
this morning it is a rather more care-
ful job than the diamond-cutter en-
counters ordinarily you know

  gardner pursed his lips thoughtfully
randalls left hand out of sight was
silently snapping its fingers at the rate
of two snaps to the second as he watched
the millionaire

  in his comparative ignorance of dia-
monds and their handling in his confi-
dence in randall would he accept the
excuse wuld be consent to wait or
would be insist on going down to the
mythical cutter and viewing the great
gordon was disaster after all to
come at once and-

  gardner was nodding reluctant acqui-
escence

   well you probably know best mr
randall he said rather grudgingly
 i should have liked to see the thing
considering its purpose and all the time
and money that has been spent on it
still youre probably right the first
impression had better be the most per-
fect possible one you cant hurry the
work any 

   it would be the last thing advisable
mr gardner said randall earnesth

  and then after a few minutes of
chatting and the recital of several ad-
ventures of the trip the jeweler was
alone once more

  he called for thorne and further
astonished that individual by ordering
that all details requiring his attention
should wait that he was not to be dis-
turbed he locked the door and lighted
a cigar and head in hands he undertook
to wrestle with the problem

  at first the gloomy side of the affair
overwhelmed him up to leaving home
that morning the bringing of the great
gordon had been nothing more than a
combination of decided enjoyment and
good business he had seen the world
he had a good- profit in view and all
things were satisfactory

  and now

  well now it appeared that the great
gordon had turned  him with all the
force of which its immense value was
capable from the probable termination
randall turned shakily he would have
to make good that went without saying
both by reason of gardners power to
compel him and by reason of his own
conscience

  it was going to be a somewhat cheer-
less process it would involve the sign-
ing over or the selling out of his splen-
did inherited business it would mean
that his almost lifelong home would
have to go as well and even that would
not square the debt for when he had
rendered himself penniless and without
income other than what he might make
on salary somewhere there would be a
balance due to gardner

  all in all the great gordon seemed
to have changed to the veriest hoodoo
the mind could conjure

  however there was another side
thanks to peltons goodness and gard-
ners acceptance of the lie he had of-
fered he had still one week in which
to act

  stones do not go into smoke without
reason a mass of sole leather does not
pass out of existence in a twinkling
somewhere or other diamond pouch and
all must still exist his part was to find
them but-how

  first and most natural inspiration
included the police randall brightened
momentarily but only momentarily

  the realization swept over him that
the very last people who must know of
the disappearance were the police to
communicate with them meant in all
probability publicity publicity signi-
fied instant ruin  not only present ruin
either it would be bad enough in all
conscience to have gardner upon him for
an accounting but his prestige in the
trade would suffer tremendously as well

  a man who can take a diamond of
immense value and lose it in such a
manner that there is absolutely no trace
is unlikely to be trusted with other dia-
monds great or small

  moreover what could the police do
the idea of using them carried with
it the accepted idea of theft and this
randall was not ready to assume

  sheldon he simply could not suspect


the all-story magazine



pelton he certainly could not suspect
lane too seemed vouched for and even
more as nearly as randall recalled he
had been farthest from the desk in that
fatal second or two that witnessed the
mysterious passing of the gem

  but if theft did not enter into the
proposition what then

  the stone had emphatically neither
blown nor slid from the desk there had
been not the slightest indication of it or
the pouch on the floor or elsewhere
and had it dropped there shoujd have
been some noise to the process case and
all the great gordon was not a feather-
weight outfit

  bah

  why hadnt he taken the three men
at their word and searched them on the
spot beyond doubt it would have been
an embarrassing a most uncomfortable
proceeding to go systematically through
their pockets but it would have estab-
lished at least that neither of them was
carrying the diamond

  or did that need to be established
was it exactly likely that any man rich
or poor good bad or indifferent with
a stolen fortune on his person in per-
fectly detectable shape would offer him-
self to be-nay would insist upon be-
ing-searched 

  randalls head began to swim out
in the store several of his beautiful
clocks began to strike off the hour of
twelve and he started up he must
have pondered the problem for a consid-
erable time and without any result
since he had but seven days the half of
one of them was far too precious to
spend in fruitless mooning

  he must have help some sort of
skilled help and at once from what
quarter obviously the private detec-
tive field

  there was bell who kept the very
quiet and unadvertised agency on the
other side of the city bell had done
well enough last spring in that little
matter of the stolen rubies indeed now
that randall came to consider it he had
done everything possible each time he
had been employed by the house for his
labors inevitably ended only when the
criminal had been detected and jailed

  randall gave a decided nod and
reached for the telephone director- and

five minutes later he had bells assur-
ance of a visit at one oclock

  the hollow farce of lunch over ran-
dall returned to find the detective wait-
ing

  he was a most ordinary appearing
man this same john bell his features
his clothes his ready-made necktie were
ordinary to a degree he might have
passed for a bookkeeper or a clerk or
a man waiting hungrily to insure your
life

  you might have gone by him ten times
in a crowd and on the eleventh failed
to realize that you had ever seen him
before and it was this same quality of
utter conventionality of appearance that
formed no small part of his stock in
trade

  another job for me mr randall

  the jeweler dropped into his chair

  if you can find the biggest diamond
that has been sold in the world during
the past ten years-yes 

  stolen bells expressionless fea-
tures betrayed only the slightest inter-
est

  randall locked his door and plunged
into the story in a low voice bell lis-
tened without comment his face grew
a trifle more animated as the jeweler
described the mysterious taking off of the
great gordon and when the recital
came to its miserable close he crossed
his legs and smiled a little

   mr randall you are quite positive
that some outside party didnt walk in
tie a string to your case and suddenly
jerk it through shade and window-or
up the chimnev-or through the key-
hole

  randall frowned at the levity bell
smiled a little more

   and as a diamond expert you would
go to court and swear that it is impos-
sible for a diamond to go into a vapor-
ous state at ordinary room tempera-
ture

   certainly but-

   then my dear sir how can you see
anything but the simple fact tlmone of
those three men stole it  

   but its impossible i tell you
they-

   nothings impossible unless it be an
impenetrable mystery mr randall if
you can show me that that diamond
the going of the gordon



wasnt stolen ill chip in all my worldly
goods with yours if bad luck should
make restitution to gardner necessary

  now who stole it lets see for
a starter were bound to get a motive
which one of your three gentlemen
needs money the most

   none of them do 

   the doctor is well fixed 

   very well more than that i have

known him for-

   well that doesnt necessarily alter
matters bell chuckled  how about
lane 

  if he is the david lane i looked
up this noon he is a person very com-
fortably supplied with this worlds
goods

  and pelton

   man alive hes wealthy and hes
mrs gardners brother in addition
ah bell studied the ceiling i
wonder if theres any little family row-
lurking around this thing ill have to
look that up too

   still he rubbed his chin  un-
likely i suppose well weve estab-
lished that none of them has any
particular reason for wanting to steal
diamonds next item why did one of
them steal it 

   bell it may sound absurd but i
cant believe that they did 

   it does sound absurd decidedly so
you are positive that the maid or the
old man you mentioned did not enter the
room  

   absolutely

   and that windows and doors were
closed and that the diamond was only
in the hands of those three men con-
found it that certainly settles it
why did he do it was it the overpow-
ering fascination of a jewel of such
size 

   it might have been that mr ran-
dall so far as you know are any of
the three temperamentally nervous-
high-strung imaginative-anything of
that sort  

   sheldon certainly isnt pelton
doesnt look or act it if he is

  and this mr lane

  well hes rather a nervous frail-
appearing person bell randall said
thoughtfully  hes a fidgety sort of
mortal i think

  ah bells face brightened a lit-
tle  now isnt it supposable that he
may have been overtaken by an insane
desire to acquire the thing

   well if that were the case why
should he insist on being searched
bell laughed shortly

  it is a sort of sticking-point that
searching business isnt it i suppose
we might consider a theory on psycho-
logical grounds that he was simply in-
capable of returning it of his own will
that he wanted to have it discovered on
him and taken away but-oh its prettv
thin

   and if such a thing had occurred
theyre all men of education and sense
if one of them had yielded to such an
impulse arent the chances ten to one
that he would have regained his senses
in a minute or two and handed it back 
 perhaps he would-perhaps he
would 

  bell considered his cigar for a time
when he looked up it was with a new
idea

   mr randall as you tell the story
the taking of that gem must have been
a lightning piece of work are any of
the three particularly quick of motion-
in a general way i mean 

   only lane-he seems to move in lit-
tle jerks bell peltons big and pon-
derous and pretty slow and for the
matter of sheldon he was across the
room when i discovered the loss

  lane again eh lane

  bells hands went into his pockets
he rose and walked slowly back and
forth for a time

   any objection to my calling up your
friend sheldon mr randall

 not the slightest why had
anything turned up he would have sent
a message before this

   doubtless but id like to have a
chat with him

  sheldon answered the wire in person
and the jewelers nerves tingled as he
watched bells face hope against hope
though it might lie he waited for the
suddenly animated expression which
would mean good news

  it failed to come bell announced
his identity and speaking sharply and
with more authority than randall would
have supposed possible put a line of
jo- v

 m

more or less painted questions he
seemed to receive answers in no sense
startling

  in the end he rang off and shrugged
his shoulders

   he has nothing to tell it seems he
says that he lias been over every inch of
the floor has taken the drawers out of
the desk and even gone into the chim-
ney with a light and that there is abso-
lutely nothing to be found

   he says that he locks the office be-
hind him when it becomes necessary to
leave and asked me if there was any-
thing more i could advise him to do
there wasnt

  the detective smiled somewhat rue-
fully

   do you know i had a notion that
if i went at him hard and fast as i did
it might startle him into giving some
sign of knowledge of the affair he
said

   and while im not out as an expert
criminal detector by means of the tele-
phoned voice im bound to say that

there was no sign of agitation and that
more open talk i never heard 

   and if you knew the man  
randall began

  hell was not listening his unattrac-
tive brow was wrinkled in thought as
he stared at the lioor he whistled an
endless melody of his own composition
and beat time with his foot until
facing randall again he seemed to
have reached a decision

   well sir we have just one course
to pursue

  and that

   that involves the most careful sort
of watch on all three men up to the very
moment we locate the great gordon
ill set men on the job this afternoon
oh dont start mr randall they
wont know any more than that theyre
shadowing somebody

  his eyes narrowed into a squinting
smile

   meanwhile if you want my private
opinion your diamond is in possession of
one mr david lane

  sacrifices of love are the
  last to be appreciated and
  the first to be forgotten j jt

horace jessup shivered a little
as he drew nearer to the roaring
fire upon the wide hearth

         pete will find it very hard
getting through to-night he remarked
impartially  the drifts in gattos
canon were almost impassable at day-
break and the yellowstone was whimper-
ing like a half-starved wolf-cub it is
going to be a fearful night bob-even
for the bad lands

  the man to whom he had spoken a
well-knit young fellow with the face of
a seraph rose languidly from his seat at
the narrow deal table and crossed the

room to the one window which the shack
afforded

  i thought that it would clear up be-
fore noon he remarked non-committal-
ly damn this climate anyway it
is early spring now down in gods coun-
try jessup the yellow jasmine is bud-
ding along the banks of the creeks and
the mocking-birds are singing-

  he stopped short suddenly

  did you speak to me jessup he
asked but jessup was poking the fire
noisily and did not answer

  perhaps he heard above the hissing of
the soft wet snow upon the panes the
echo of a birds love-song perhaps he
saw in the thousand circling sparks that
melted in the black maw of the wide
chimney the fluttering fireflies that
braided a brooding southern night with
torches of palest gold

   the storm has been growing heavier

a raw spot youve been a good friend
to me though old chap and if the time
ever comes when i can do you a good
turn-

  jessup did not look at him

  he still stared through the tiny win-
dow at the barren sweep of the dreary
waste of butte and canon the swollen
current of willow-bordered water creep-
ing along under the sullen sky to join
its alkali-roughened voice to the roar
and clamor of the yellowstone so lately
freed from its bonds of ice late in the
season as it was the scene was especially
gloomy with no faintest hint of vegeta-
tion no vaguest promise of a resurrect-
ing spring

  horace jessup dragged his eyes away
from it to the scanty fringe of conifers
that formed the green border of our
ladys mantle and higher yet to the
pure white shrouded form half-veiled in
the drifts of swirling snow

   i think that i hear pete now he
said still without turning  i guess he
is going to make it after all and the
storm cant be so heavy as you fancied
porter or he never would have been
able to get the stage through

  porter had flung himself on the
lounge and now raised himself on his
elbow

   good old boy  le said approv-
ingly  i didnt say that he wouldnt
get through i didnt speak so posi-
tively

  it was nearing night-fall and the
stage stopped short at the low fence of
lodge-pole pine that surrounded the
shack pete climbed down from his seat
a little stiffly his weather-beaten face
bitten blue by the cruel wind looked
drawn and puckered like unripened fruit
that the frost has nipped his voice
however was cheery enough

   ill have to camp here with you fel-
lows to-night he said casually  i
wouldnt try to get any farther-not for
any amount of money i ought to a
got through too ive got two pas-
sengers in the stage booked for pike

  two passengers

  something in the bland artlessness of
the stage-drivers face had made porter
who had followed jessup to the door
vaguely suspicious

  pete nodded

  petticoats he said pleasantly in a
stage-whisper  a young woman anil
her aunt and say porter shes a peach
all right-the young one is the

other-

   is this the place where we are to
stop driver

  the clear metallic frosty tones had
an immediate effect upon pete he
winked at porter and turned hurriedly

   this is the place-yesm he said
genially  we cant get any farther
to-night and thats the plain truth of
it-and theres no use trying the
horses have been floundering belly-deep
in snow for the last four hours and they
are plumb beat now and with night
coming on--

 the woman who had spoken said
something in a lower voice to her com-
panion who seemed to agree-a little re-
luctantly 

  if you are quite sure that it is for
the best she said in a low sweet voice

  porter pushed the grinning stage-
driver aside and assisted the two to alight

   you are both very welcome to the
little that we have to offer i am sure
he said hastily  we can at least assure
you a roof over your heads and some-
thing fairly decent to eat jessup

  but jessup with unwonted shyness
had vanished

   you are very good said the elde
woman stiffly  i had no idea thatwie
roads would be so impassable now that it
is almost the last of april bari

home-

  the young man looked at her whole-
some middle-aged face a little wistfully

   perhaps  had better introduce my-
self he ventured  my name is robert
porter and my partner and i have only
been west -a little over a year  an

from louisiana he-

 from louisiana the older
woman looked at him a little oddly

 do you hear that margaret my dear
the young man as we are is from
louisiana the world is a little place
after all we are from shreveport mr
porter my niece and i my husband
was a norris you know we are go-
ing-

  the girl a slender blue-eyed thing
created a momentary diversion much to
porters relief
  i am almost frozen aunt martha
she complained  and you are keeping
mr-porter-bare-headed in the snow
we had better go in the house dear
since he has been so good as to say that
we might the explanation you know
can come later

   porter still more than a little puzzled
by something peculiar in the situation
went before them a little slowly up the
path the older woman peered beyond
him through the swirling drifts at the
cabin and caught above it for a fleeting
instant the vague outlines of the rock-
formation called by the natives  our
lady of the snows  that towered above
them then the black bitter gloom of
a night in late spring in the edge of the
bad lands closed down and shut the
vision out

   how spiritually inspiring your sur-
roundings are she said still a little
stiffly  what an uplift such soul-com-
munings with nature must bring about
 yes no doubt agreed porter pleas-
antly if a little absently he was won-
dering nervously whether he would have
time to whisk a certain black bottle and
well-thumbed pack of cards off the table
before her eyes would fall upon them
 confound jessup 

    you are fifty miles from the railroad
here are you not  asked the girl the
icv wind snatched the words from her lips
so greedily that porter scarcely caught
them  i dont know how you manage
to exist it is so desolate and dreary

    it is better in the spring said the
young man hurriedly  you would not
think what a difference there could be
ill admit that there is little cheerful-
ness even about  our lady of the
snows  now the night and the snow
have veiled much of her beauty but in
the spring she is very gay you know
then her mantle is blue with wild lark-
spur and she wears a wreath of deep-
red wild-roses like a string of coral about
her throat there used to be a tiny mis-
sion tucked away in the canon at her
feet but it was abandoned long ago

  she stared at him through the dark-
ness striving vainly to see his features

   my name in margaret loomis she
said  we ought never to have under-
taken the journey at this season but we
were told-

  her companion pushed the door of the
cabin open almost seeming to ignore the
fact that she was talking

  a bright fire flared a welcome to them
from the wide hearth and two lamps
had been lighted but the absent-mind-
ed jessup had evidently forgotten the
palpable tokens of his own and his
friends depravity the cards still lay
face upward on the table and the half-
emptied bottle of whisky was still very
much in evidence jessup himself was
not visible

  he-my friend-may be helping
pete with the team said porter try-
ing to appear at ease and agonizedly
conscious that the eyes of the older wom-
an were resting frostily and accusingly
upon the damning articles lying on the
table he was keenly sensible that any
attempt at apology would only make mat-
ters worse

  the two women took the seats which
he placed for them near the leaping
flame and they both-the younger es-
pecially-showed a decided inclination
to maintain a dignified reserve-even
with erring compatriots of her own

   i am horribly tired she said to her
companion in a low voice  you may
tell them-these people-as much or as
little as you like dear i think that

i	should like to lie down at once if you
do not mind

  young porter had been dragging
things about clumsily behind a gaudy
print curtain that concealed one-half the
cabin from view

   we have few visitors here he said
apologetically emerging with a very red
face from behind it  an occasional

cowboy- i am afraid that the very

best that we can do will be bad enough
after all but if the young lady cares

to rest-

  the girl thanked him with a rather
watery smile

   i have understood that visitors are
always welcome in the west she said in
a forlorn little voice  we are very-
grateful to you for your hospitality i
am sure mr porter

  she vanished behind the flimsy curtain
ablaze with flaming poppies and gay with
green roses as she spoke

   the child is tired out remarked the
okier woman briefly  tea oh i


the all-story magazine

think not thank you  seldom drink
it

   porter still slightly mystified by jes-
sups unaccountable absence placed food
upon the table a little absently

   i am sorry that i cannot offer you
more lie said shyly  a half-breed
does the most of our cooking for u-

and she is away now i dare say-

  mrs norris eyed him coldly

    had better come to the point at
once if we are to understand each other
i suppose she said coldly  mr por-
ter we-my niece and i-are looking for
a lad who left home two years ago in a

fit of perversity the stage-drivcr-

  a sound behind him made porter turn
sharply

  oh its you is it lie said to jes-
sup who was shaking the loose snow
from his wide-brimmed hat  i couldnt
think what on earth had become of you
jessup looked beyond him at the wom-
an still seated at the table she faced
them both alike with level uninterested
gaze

   one of the horses had cast a shoe
he explained monotonously  i had to
help pete about it a little

  mrs norris had bowed to him coldly
enough evidently she was not prepared
to take him as readily into her good
graces as she had taken his friend

    thought at first that the stage-
driver might be able to tell us what we
wanted to know she said slowly re-
verting to the subject again  he looked
as if he might but he turned glum of
a sudden and would say just nothing at
all

   pete is a half-breed remarked por-
ter explanatorily  they are shy you
know and quick to take alarm when they
are questioned and mostly they are gov-
erned by a vague sense of honor and
there is a certain crude code to which
they conform perhaps pete suspected
that you were asking questions-which
you had no right to ask

   she flushed

  	the lad for whom we are searching
left home over two years ago as i have
said she repeated  he went away
because of a miserable mistake-a mis-
understanding with my brother it

seems-

   are you speaking of-the young

ladys brother there was a vague
change in porters voice

  	am speaking of my nieces cousin-
the lad to whom she was engaged you
see my brother was an old man and a
sum of money was missing he was very
generous with his nephew generous to

the point of insanity  think and-

 well

   well my brother awakened one day
as i have said with a large sum of money
missing and there was meg with a dia-
mond which must have cost an extrav-
agant sum flashing on her finger a stone
which no one but a rich girl had any
right to wear

   had he given it to her 

   most certainly who else could
have done so that was not the ques-
tion however the foolish boy chose
to deny that my brothers money had paid
for it-chose indeed to refuse to answer
any of the questions which he asked af-
ter that it seemed that there was nothing
that could be done to bring about a rec-
onciliation between the two my brother
refused to prosecute but the search for
the money was at once abandoned and
the breach remained absolute the stub-
born lad had forfeited the affection of
his guardian and abused the confidence
of the young girl who had promised to
be his wife she told him so

  jessup had not seen margaret loomis
naturally he was not so interested in
the story as his friend was  he stirred
restlessly in his seat

   the lad was as foolish as he was
young he forgot that his uncles bark
was worse than his bite and that the girl
whom he loved was an impulsive chit
who did not know her own mind ten min-
utes together he treated them both
to a theatrical display of something that
was half temper and half eloquence and
quitted home in a huff we have not
seen him since

   so far the story is a very ordinary
one said porter evasively  i fail to
see-

  the woman laid the bit of untasted
bread back upon her plate there were
tears in her eyes

   my brother died very recently she
said in a lower voice just before his
deatli he discovered that he had accused
his nephew unjustly and that another
our lady of the snows



man was responsible for the theft i
dont know where arthur got the money
that he paid for margarets engagement
ring i dont care to know and neither
does she she is breaking her heart over
the injustice that sent him out in the
world i am going to help to find him
for her if i can

  for the first time jessup spoke

   maybe the way the boy got the mon-
ey was quite as much to his discredit
as you thought even if your brother was
not the victim he said harshly  his
flight would certainly indicate it

   i dont care whether it was or not
said the lady with some agitation she
wiped her eyes defiantly  he may have
committed highway robbery for all i
know-er care i am not going to have
his life ruined or megs heart broken if
i can help it he is my dead brothers
son and i think shame to myself and
shame to the dead that we allowed him-
our own lad-to sneak out of his own
house at night like a convicted felon
porter looked helplessly from her to
jessup and back again

   i dont see just what help you can
expect from us he said undecidedly

  for the second time the woman showed
traces of impatience

   we heard once that he was out in
this part of the country some where- she
said  the stage-driver practically ad-
mitted that he had heard of him and
then as i have told you he shut up like
a clam and not another word from him

    you might ask porter he said at
last when margaret could not restrain
her tears  you see he lives where he
gets a sight of just about every stranger
that cocoes int the country first nd last
we call this place the  gate of the bad
lands i dont know whether he knows
anything about it or not and i cant
promise you that he wiii tell you any-
thing about it even if be doe kni w

   where are you from young man 
she asked jessup suddenly and sharply

  jessup reddened he made a grace-
ful effort however to overlook this de-
liberate if unconscious breach of the
cardinal fundamental laws of hospital-
ity i am from arkansas he admit-
ted hastily

   you look like it agreed the woman
 youve got the same maiaria- not

that you can help it of course well it
seems that neither of you are in-
clined-

    isnt a question of inclination ob-
jected porter hastily it has been near-
ly two years you know you said that
yourself and shs-the girl he lowed-
if she accepted his guilt without a pro-
test-

  there was a little vague indeterminate
stir at the door and it fell open

  a young woman crossed the threshold
noiselessly the high cheek-bones the
shy movements the straight black hair
the lithe grace of the figure told unmis-
takably of indian blood she looked
from one to the other of the little party
in surprise not unmixed with a tinge of
dread

   this young woman was connected
with the njission of which i spoke to vour
niece just now said porter bridging
an awkward pause  she is called in
the language of her people  swaying
reed she understands english perfect-
ly so it might be as well-

  martha norriss face did not soften

   what is she doing here  she asked
pertinently

  the indian woman had looked at her
at first indifferently and later with some-
thing that was almost like trouble in her
dark eyes again she cast a quick be-
wildered glance from porter to jessup
and then back again to the former

   shall i go now   she asked sim-
piy-

  jessup did not answer but porter with
a glance at mrs norris shook his head

   not now he said simply  the
storm is growing worse i will take you
back a little later myself

  but still jessup neither looked at her
ncr spoke

   i asked you where you came from
on account of your name said the older
-woman addressing jessup again and re-
verting to her grievance  our lads
mother was a jessup from the nonhem
pan of the state i thought it likely
that you might be related to some of our
people

  jessup stared at her as if fascinated
bat shook his head

   all the people that i have are in
the west he said stubbornly

  he looked across at the half-breed


the all-story magazine

for the first time but she had averted
her face and her eyes were quite hidden
under their long lashes

   well i hope that you will both
think it over said the woman with a
sigh  maybe when you have thought
about it a while it will come to you-
whether you have seen him or not i
mean he was always a great hand for
stock of all kinds when i do find him
 expect to find him in the cattle busi-
ness margaret and i have talked it
over and we both feel just exactly the
same about it all that i am afraid

of is-

  she hesitated

   the jessups were always fools about
women she said regretfully if i
were to find arthur entangled with an

indian woman-

 porter flushed	

   she he said shortly referring to the
half-breed girl  understands english
as well as you do i guess you have for-
gotten that i told you that just now
you will remember that i mentioned that
she was educated at the mission and
personally i guess that i might just
as well tell you now first as last that in
my opinion the indian women are as a
rule far and away too good for the
white men with whom they associate
he hesitated in his turn

   i might tell you about a man whom
i knew once and who came out west
to the bad lands he said a little
vaguely  he-had got into trouble
of some kind back in the states and had
been run out maybe it was his own
fault and maybe it wasnt i guess that
he was about the only one that could
say as to that he wasnt a very at-
tractive object when he got here he
had stopped over in st paul or some-
where and had gone just about all the
gaits i guess-and a little more he
wasnt fit for a decent woman to touch
with a pair of tongs

  the half-breed had evidently found
tlie presence of the strangers embarrass-
ing she arose from her seat in the cor-
ner impulsively and with a pleading
word or two in her own tongue but por-
ter shook his head and she sank back
again in her place

he was sick a long tune-some sort
of a malignant fever they thought h was

at first you see they couldnt jl
a doctor then smallpox in an es-
pecially nasty form developed one or
two people had clung to him up to that
time they left him then-all of them

  he paused significantly the indian
woman sat quite still as if carved out  f
stone her unwinking gaze never for
an instant left the leaping flames nor
did mrs norris move she looked from
one to the other of the young men dully
and behind the dividing curtain a little
current of air set the poppies nodding
feverishly and caused die painted roses
to lift their fading heads only jessup
looked at none of them his clenched
right hand thrown across the table un-
clenched slowly and nervelessly he did
not speak

   there was one creature a woman-
scarcely better than a child-to whom
this man he might have been the neph-
ew of whom you spoke this type
of the eternally masculine had been
kind i do not know in what way he
was not bad to look upon at the very first
before the fever struck him down and
it may be that he had tossed her a kind
word now and then as you might toss a
bone to a starving dog but when the
others had quitted him and left him to
die as not even a decent dog is left she
went to his relief

   maybe you dont know what she
braved-maybe  dont the indian is a
bundle of contradictions sometimes even
to those who know him liest and mird
you this girl had no exaggerated illu-
sions in the matter she knew exactly
what she had to expect when she watched
the lodge-poles of her fathers teepee
fall that cool morning and saw his slim-
legged children brown and sinewy
break the trail matted with kinnikinick
and oregon-grape that lay northward

   deliberately she shut her eyes on
the mist that closed down over the faint
far-away trail to the distant tangling
smoke that columned upward and came
to her with a personal message delib-
erately she would not breathe the tang
of the wo-xi-fire the scent of salmon
broiling on the coals the odor of the
tamarack ard the bruised fruit of the
oregon-grape deliberately she closed
her ears to the thousand sounds of the
forest that called to her
our lady of the snows



    she went inside the white mans cab-
in looked down upon what had once
been a man and closed the door behind
her

   she stayed there eight weeks part
of the time when delirium held its vic-
tim strongest in its ruthless hold she
suffered actual abuse at his hands it is
easy to strike you know when there is
no resistance her wrists and hands were
black and bruised once when she re-
sisted liis attempts to rise from his bed
he struck her savagely-a brutal blow in
the face with his clenched fist

   it left a mark that she will carry
to her grave she was always his in-
ferior-admittedly sometimes-rarely
for he talked little-he raved of the girl
who had cast him off for a trifle his
blows left physical scars his words left
spiritual disfigurements that will last
until death-and after

   he began to grow better finally
thanks to her care and nursing the
fever left him weak mentally as well
as physically the others of her race
and his did not return

   then winter came again and if
they were to live through the long
months when the ice slowly choked the
raucous cry of the yellowstone into a
feeble whimper there was much to do
and she never strong was enfeebled
by the long confinement and by the dis-
ease that taken in a milder form than
his own had fed upon her childish
frame and during all this time he
never-i have had it from his own lips-
gave her one loving word she never
asked for one

   the winter deepened and her people
came back into the sheltered little val-
ley under the smile of our lady of the
snows the first voice she heard-the
first face she saw-i think that i will
spare you that i will not tell yon what
either brought her

   but a day came she had worked
hard and was tired when something
happened she had been engaged in
the most menial tasks-the gathering of
fagots to keep the dogs of cold at bay
through the long winter and had strayed
some distance from home coming
hack that day when the twilight was al-
most gone she found a tiny pool of al-
kali water fringed about with thin

starved grasses that the ice had never
hound

    she stared down into the clear mir-
 ror and the slender vestige of vanity
 and self-respect that his treatment and
 open contempt had left her took flight
 forever the indian woman loses youth
 and good looks early enough at best and
 the half-breed-that alien blossom of
 ill-nourished soil-withers usually long
 before the flower is perfected it was
 a woman of middle age haggard and
 tired and faded and ugly who looked
 back at her from the little mirror set in
 the silver frame of frosted alkali

    i have no idea of what she was
thinking as she went back to the cabin
that night only god who is very mer-
ciful to the women of his sinful world
and who of all people need mercy most
can know

    it was very late when she opened
 the door of the little cabin and he had
 grown tired waiting for her he was
 hungry and cold and lonely remem-
 ber i am not trying to excuse him he
 was not trying to excuse himself when
 he told her about it later she crept about
 her delayed tasks in the indian way with
 his brutal words stinging her

    she was so engrossed that some one
 had called outside more than once be-
 fore either of them heard it he did not
 raise his head when she looked at him
 appealingly-it was one of his glum
 days-and she opened the door hurried-
 ly herself

    the moon was shining and above
 the toil and fret and trouble our lady
 of the snows looked down with some-
 thing of the same vague pity that her
 gentle heart had held even in the midst
 of her own sorrow when she looked at
 those who hung one upon either side of
 her son upon the trees that bore such
 strange unnatural fruit that morning
 long ago upon that nameless hill above
 the garden

     hello  the voice called again

   what do you want it was the
impatient voice of the man behind her
he pushed her roughly aside

     i want to know who lives here and
 if you are the party i want i am look-
 ing for a fellow that lives somewhere in
 the valley a squaw-man-

   no i dont suppose that there is


the atl-story magazine

 any use going on he left her next day
 and you can see just about what it must
 have meant to her she was not all
 indian you know there were the long
 months at the mission and her white
 blood and there was another element
 to reckon with unfortunately

 she loved him-god knows why
women are made that way and she
was just indian enough to snatch up the
gift that another woman had thrown
away and just enough to suffer-suf-
fer 

  jle looked curiously over his shoul-
der there had been no sound behind
him but margaret loomis stood there
white and motionless the gaudy pop-
pies no longer flaunting lying frost-bit-
ten against her colorless face she did
not speak

  she only stared at porter and from
him to jessup with a growing horror
of comprehension in her face

  as for jessup even porter who had
fancied that he knew the man-his faults
and weaknesses-as no one else did
or could looked at him as at the face
of an utter stranger the wind out-

side had strengthened and the whisper
of the snow upon the window had
changed to the hurtling mutter of sleet
the sound had a chord of summons in
it steadfast and clear as the note of a
bugle

  the fire on the hearth had died down
just a little and the flickering sparks
were no longer like the flicker of the
fireflies of a brooding southern night
or if so it was that of a night whose
moon had gradually gone down at mid-
night

  then jessup rose and slipping the
resisting hand of the indian woman in
his turned and faced the others

   i have been a brute he said  and
worse i have sunk to depths of cow-
ardice of which even the most craven of
wretches never dreamed i thank you
porter for your words of to-night in
uttering them you have cancelled every
debt that you ever owed me

   i may be lacking in the elements
of a hero but i will no longer forget my
manhood so help me god aunt mar-
tha-margaret-you will allow me to
present my wife 

   truant love

synopsis of previous chapters

arthur dale artist on returning one night to his cottage in the scotch high-
lands setjs before his door a packing-case in which when he opens it he finds to his
horror the apparently lifeless body of a young girl he succeeds however in resus-
citating her but she upon regaining consciousness is unable to remember even so much
as her own identity much less the scries of events which preceded her mysterious arrival
the mist becomes so thick that it is impossible to leave the cottage that night so the girl
retires to sleep in the loft dale goes out for a moment and on returning is greeted by
the sight of a stranger loading a revolver in front of his fire this is sir george belville
who tells dale that he is in search of four strangers who have been seen about the moors
dale distrusts belville believing him io be involved in the packing-case mystery and his
suspicions become stronger when sir george suddenly dashing out into the night disap-
pears in the fog and a sound of firing begins dale rushes out also and when he again
returns finds three more strange men in the house one of whom dressed as a groom
threatens him with a revolver and admits knowing all about the box but believer that it
contained a lifeless body and insists on being led to where dale has buried it dile pre-
suming it best to allow the groom to remain deceived agrees to lead them to the place
the girl in the loft makes a slight noise and dale upon being questioned says that it is
his wife the groom says she must come too the two other men attempt to get into the
loft but the trap-door leading up has evidently been fastened down while they are
working to force it the girl who has escaped by a window opens the cottage-door from
the outside dale knocks down the groom and with the girl runs out into the fog
there they encounter a regular running fight in which sir george and his servant mon-
tague are pitted against the groom and his followers after a series of adventures dale
leads the exhausted and fainting girl back lo the cottage where in a pool of blood  the
floor is the groom-dead and in death the fact is disclosed that it is a woman in mans
clothes

chapter vi

abduction

dale relighted the candle and sur-
veyed the gruesome sight it
was as horrible as anything he
had ever looked upon and he
was more than glad that the girl in her
faint was saved from seeing it

   with little liking for the task he took
up the body of the unfortunate woman
and carried it outside to the rear of the
cottage where lie left it beside the mys-
terious packing-box in his mind was
the conviction that the dead woman was
immediately concerned with the events
which must-have preceded the arrival of
the box and as he walked back to the

 began march a  - s t  r y m

house he rejoiced almost at the divine
retribution which had overtaken the
vicious little groom

  after putting the room in somewhat
decent order and removing or hiding the
signs of the tragedy dale for the third
time set about reviving the girl grad-
ually under his ministrations she re-
turned to consciousness dale watched
her heavy eyelids flutter

   is that you uncle she murmured
  was dreaming of the princess why
wheres your beard then with a sud-
den start she seemed to realize all that
had happened  oh she cried
 where are they are we safe

  you remember he asked eagerly
imagining that at last iib-it was to be

thrown on the mystery in which he was
involved  you remember dont you  
she made a gesture of despair

   it has gone from me again she
said dully  for a moment i knew
for a moment i remembered there
was an old white-bearded man there
was a woman a dark woman-but its
all gone from me now

  and she shook her head gazing into
his eyes with dumb anguish that cut into
his heart

   let me go she cried suddenly
springing to her feet im sure im a
crazy woman let me go why should
you be troubled with my madness 

   have you so soon forgotten he
asked taking her hands  what we said
to each other out there in the mist 

   its not possible indeed its not
she panted trying hard to release her-
self  how can you care for one who
cant even tell her own name 

  if thats all he answered tenderly
 ill give you a name to me you shall
be always  beloved 

  she did not speak but presently he
found that she was weeping and though
he did his best to soothe her it was long
before her sobs ceased but at last weari-
ness overcame her and she fell asleep
in his arms he laid her again on the
settle then went outside and sat down
with his back against the door

  his thoughts were many and strange
he knew it to be a black business un-
doubtedly concerned with attempted
murder and now probably with abduc-
tion the people of whom she had
spoken-the princess her uncle the old
man with the white beard those
whom he had seen-belville montague
wilkes and the quasi-groom-were they
all her enemies were any of them her
friends 

  it was imperative that they get to a
town of some size and consult authori-
ties and so about sunrise after long
hours of thinking and dozing he went
to rouse the girl it took a deal of
knocking to wake her but finally he
heard her sleepy voice asking what was
the trouble

  he answered that it was morning and
time they were away and heard her
after a moments silence give a little
sobbing exclamation as though the mem-

ory of the events through which she had
so recently passed had rolled back upon
her mind he knocked again and told
her that in the chamber above she would
find such toilet requisites as he possessed
-at any rate clean towels and a hand-
basin

  it was not long before they were tak-
ing a hasty meal

  the girl wasweary and nervous her
face pallid her eyes rimmed yet it was
borne in upon dale that he bad absurdly
underestimated her charms for though
before he had thought her lovely-an ad-
jective he perceived inadequate-now
indeed she was a beautiful woman he
did not realize that love had touched his
eyes with tender exaggeration

  the meal w-as silent the girl hardly-
speaking dale almost as quiet for in
his heart the young artist was praying
very fervently that she might never have
cause to regret his advent into her life

  as soon as they had finished they
started off over the rough track to the
village the walking was hard and the
girl still tired and somewhat lame yet
they made fair time and in an hour or
so were at the village inn a small estab-
lishment hardly more than a public-
house the landlady however was a
decent pleasant woman and in her
charge dale placed the girl while he
went to find the village police in regard
to the death of the groom and to the
railroad station

   theres no train said the landlady
 for twa hour or mair

   im going to order a special said
dale impatiently  the ladys business
is too serious for a moments delay see
that you make her comfortable and al-
low no one to trouble her

  he went away assuring the girl who
was clearly ill at ease at being left alone
that he would not be long but as it hap-
pened fully three-quarters of an hour
had passed before he returned he had
had some trouble in arranging for the
special train but at last was able to
make his way back to the inn with the
knowledge that they were already get-
ting up steam in an asthmatic old
freight-engine which would be ready for
him by the time he returned with his
companion

  in the hall of the inn dale met the
enshrouded



landlady her air of subdued anxiety
struck an instant chill into his heart

   whats happened   he demanded

   weel sir replied the woman  ye
stc the bonny young leddys fayther-

  father interrupted dale did
she know him

  ken her ain fayther echoed the
landlady wonderingly  twould be a
sorry lassie that didna sir but i didna
ken for i just telt him whaur she war
an in he went but i thocht i heard a
cry a while sine

  dale when the thought came to him
that this was but another seeking to
harm the girl was swamped in a wave of
impotent anger and discouragement

  	woman what have you done he
groaned

   whats ailin ye she asked him
 would ye hae me keep the bit lassie
frae her ain fayther

  he didnt answer but with bitter self-
reproach that he should have allowed
the girl for even one moment out of his
sight went blindly toward the room
where he had left her the door was
bolted on the inside and when lie called
there was no answer

  his pale face grew still paler and
disregarding the shrill outcry of the
landlady he drew back a few feet and
putting down his shoulder hurled him-
self with all his might at the panel near-
est the bolt it gave at once he
pushed his hand through the splintered
wood drew back the bolt and hinging
the door open burst into the room

  a glance showed him that the room
was empty and so terrible had been the
pictures conjured up in his mind that
for the moment he felt a certain relief
a second glance showed a wide-opened
window through which exit must have
been made all his fears came back
what her enemies had failed to do by
violence they had now effected by guile

  there was no sign that the girl had
been there she had vanished as she had
come-without warning all the love
in dales being cried out at being thus
deprived of its object he felt his en-
ergy sapped from him as though by an
illness for a moment lie stood helpless
and uncertain then determination came
back to him and again heedless of the
shrill protesting landlady  e leaped

through the open window into the court
yard

  here his fierce stammering queries
that half-frightened the rustics revealed
that two strangers a man and a girl had
been seen walking away a short time
before

  he listened impatiently till they be-
gan to repeat themselves then hurried

c horse from the inn stable and jumping
pon it galloped off in the direction the
rustics had indicated then he tore
through the village beating his old
mount till it reached an acme of fear
unknown to it since colthood and setting
all the population agape

  the road they were on led only to 
bare moor he knew where he could
surely overtake them so confident was
he that at the foot of every rise he more
than half expected that upon reaching
the summit he would come up with the
fugitives as he rounded the shoulder
of a hill he noticed without paying
much attention the faint odor of gas-
eous smoke then as he turned into the
open and came out with the wide moor
on his left a groan of utter disappoint-
ment burst from his lips

  not three hundred yards away was a
large motor-car in which were seated
two men between them with drooping
head and rounded shoulders was the
huddled form of the girl lie sought
the car was moving slowly but as he
appeared ran up its speed and in less
than a minute it was more than half a
mile away the puffing of its motor com-
ing back faintly to his ears the dust
rising in a dun cloud behind it

  dales first impulse was to pursue
then grimly laughing at his idiocy he
pulled up short

  broken in spirit he slouched deject-
edly on his useless horse and watched
the girl disappear

       chapter vii

sir georges slave

   for a while he stared after the car as
it drew away now scurrying along the
edge of the heath now burrowing down
out of sight beyond the hills and rises
to come up again in a cloud of dust and
steam


the all-story magazine

  in the end he jerked arcrond the head

of hit disgusted horse and was about to
gallop back to town when he heard his
name called and saw hurrying toward
him two men

  of these one was montague belvilles
servant as demure and decorous as ever
the other was wilkes late subordinate
to the dead groom when last dale had
seen them they had been in deadly con-
flict with each other now they appeared
to be comrades wilkes reached the
road first and came to a halt in front
of the rider who looked down at him
uncertainly and angrily

   beg pardon but this ere bloomin
gent want to speak to you said wilkes
panting after his run then he added
with an affable nod at dales unfettered
hands  see youve got em off then
reglar orrid feelin aint it but
eavins we done it tender long the wye
them peelers andle a bloke

  what do you want asked dale
impassively speaking over wilkess head
to montague who had by that time come
up

   sir george belvilles compliments
sir said the man his face as unexpres-
sive and immobile as ever  and he is
arranging to have you hanged for mur-
der unless you promise not to interfere
any longer in this matter

  dale gasped

  are vcu crazv he started
 why-

   i cant answer for myself sir re-
plied the mar with a momentary lifting
of his strangely pale eyes  but my mas-
ter is quite sane i am to make you un-
derstand sir that he is arranging to
have you arrested for murder unless you
promise to leave here at once to preserve
silence about all that has passed and to
resign the young lady to his care sir
george bids me add that his only desire
is to save and protect the young lady
from a certain great peril that menaces
her

   i can believe your last lialf-dozen
words said dale watching him keenly
to see if he was aware of the girls dis-
appearance  but the lady you speak
of is-there he turned and pointed
to the motor-car that was now but a
moving dot far down the rough moor
track

  montague coughed and raised his
hand to his mouth dale thought he
grinned as well as coughed under the
cover of his palm

  it was wilkes who finally spoke and
he said

   blimee d ye mean to sve theyve
got er agyne

   who are they asked dale and
then as montague hesitated to reply he
added earnestly  if she is in any real
danger i wish you would tell me give
me some idea at least

   in danger ye montague answered
slowly  but not immediately i should
judge unless their hands are forced by
publicity especially she should be safe
if its true as you say that her memorys
lost after all i dont suppose they
have any wish to kill her if they can
manage without

  dale leaned down to montague

   ill give you he said  a hundred
pounds if youll tell me all you know
about this matter

  wilkes who had been craning his
neck to hear this last sentence for all-
or perhaps because it was clearly not in-
tended for his ears-gave vent to a long
whistle

   lor love ye he said  ill tell all
i know for a fiver

  but montague shook his head in
silence and for the nest few minutes
stood quiet his mind evidently far away
in thought dale stared at him won-
dering what sort of man he might have
been before he became mixed up with
this belville after a while he grew
restless

   well he said  i suppose youre
as big a rogue as your master give
him my compliments and tell him that
within an hour or so i shall be on my
way to the police to tell them the full
facts then i think he will be com-
pelled to give the explanation he now
refuses up at my cottage there is
something that cannot well be hidden

  montague looked up at him suddenly

   but you see you aint got no cottage
now snickered wilkes

  dale jerked round and stared at him
the man was grinning inanely

   yes sir supplied montague
 wilkes and myself have just been burn-
ing your cottage down
enshrouded



   but what for the colossal nerve
 of the thing somehow struck a humor-
 ous chord in dales make-up rather than
 one of anger he almost could have
 smiled

     we buried the body too sir mon-
 tague continued deferentially  and took
 the liberty of placing beside it a long
 sharp knife of yours which we found in
 order that it might seem to be the
 weapon with which the woman was
 killed

     at present sir george is i believe
 drawing up the story wilkes and i are
 to swear to it is to be represented i
 understand that-well i wont go into
 detail suffice it that the story is dis-
 tinctly disagreeable and will i imagine
 prove detrimental to both your good
 name and to your health

    dale listened numb with wonder

    his sensation of amusement was rap-
 idly changing to one of helpless wrath
 he knew himself to be powerless and
 as the fulness of belville intentions
 came to him he pictured the future very-
 black before him besides the personal
 danger and harm of the story it flashed
 across him too that if he were entangled
 in such a mesh of lies he would be able
  to do little for the girl

   he could not he believed cope at
 the same time with her enemies and with
 this accusation against him neverthe-
 less he answered

     i shall tei my story regardless and
 i think it will be the more plausible
 the truth is apt to hang together better
 than a fabric of lies

    ah -montague bowed apologetic-
 ally- there i must beg to differ sir
 your statement will not hold when the
 lies are being woven by a gentleman so
 proficient in prevarication as my mas-
 ter

    a gent added wilkes  with a
 natral-bora gift fr it such a gift 

    he rolled his eyes in an ecstacy of ad-
 miration and then looking at dale went
 through an unpleasant pantomime of
 choking with his head lolling on one
 side

    of course resumed montague
  sir georges plans may have altered
 now that the lady is no longer in your
 care

    dale nodded in reply

  th re seemed to be little to say he
was clearly fighting with odds against
him against one at least who could
outd him at every turn when it cam
to ingenious perversions of the truth  id
shady machinations how could lie
best save the girl who with her lack of
memory was as great a hindrance as an
aid

  montague watched him in silence the
light of constrained passion behind his
strange eyes glowing with an intensity
of hidden feeling it seemed as if he
guessed the artists thoughts for he
waved wilkes aside and said in a
per

    mr dale your best chance of help-
ing her is to keep at liberty belvilles
chief idea is to get you out of the way
but now that she has disappeared asain
his plans as i said may change let me
advise you come and -ee him before
acting in this matter i think he will
lie wiling to postpone anything in order
to rescue her from the princess

  from the princess repeated dale
sharply then he went on if youre
honest if youre at all friendly why
cant you tell me what you know how
can i judge what is best for her -hiie
im so mazed  

   sir georges heel is on my neck re-
plied the other with an inexpressible
plav of emotions across his mask-like
face  i am his slave-body and soul
he owns me and makes me do what he
wills me to do if i dared i would
act readily- enough but i darent

  he spoke with a great bitterness and
dale felt again even more acutely how
formidable was his adversary who could
reduce men ta such complete and loath-
some subjection

   what are you afraid of  he a-ked
but the other only shivered for ar-ver

   fight him in the dark he broke
out thats your only chance our
story is too strange to be believed espe-
cialiy with sir george weaving lies about
you agree with him now and bide your
time or you will deprive the girl of one
of the only two frieuds she has in the
world

  two friends said de swiftly
 who is the other 

   i said the man

   you  dale almost laughed in his
i

the all-story magazine

face  you dont expect to be believed
do you  

  the other shrugged his shoulders

   oh no he said with apathy then
ls voice changed grew small and hard
 but  tell you and swear it by my
hate for this man belville that i hug to
ray soul by day and by night that your
best chance of helping and saving that
girl is to ostensibly yield to sir george
and work with him till the time comes
till the time comes be repeated

  dale hesitated for a moment mon-
tague was very likely right so-

  take me to him he said at
leas ill find out what he has to say be-
fore i go to the police

  montague changed again dale was
beginning to feel him an emotional
weathercock

   look here he cried throwing his
aims wide as though in an appeal-
 look here i beg of you that if you
value your life youll go on  sketching
tour to italy for the next sis months or
a year dont match yourself between
these two the princess and sir george

   toat advice said dale  i think
i shall not follow

   you dont know sir george said
montague with a sigh  he will get
his grip on you as he has on me it
would be like brute belville just for the
fun of it to make you best man at his
wedding to stand by and watch while
he married the girl

   now cried dale stung to fury by

the suggestion  by my honor-

   ah interrupted montague  i
swore that oath once

   as im a man said dale  i-

   i too interrupted montague again
 was once a man

   yell take me to him exclaimed
the artist with an angry gesture

chapter viii

a treaty of alliajfce

  it was to a mall shoo ting- lodge that
tlale was conducted by montague who
now had suddenly reverted to the demure
and respectful man servant interlarding
his conversation with sirs and much
hat-touching and seemingly quite oblivi-
ous to the fact that a while before he had

displayed a different side to his char-
acter

  he was shown into a very comfortable
and neatly arranged little sitting-room
where a fire burned cheerily in the
grate he sa down wondering a gcod
deal what was going to happen for after
his first impulse to accede to montagues
suggestion it had occurred to him that
he was acting rashly in thus visiting alone
and unarmed a man as desperate and
unscrupulous as belville seemed to be

  his cogitations were broken into how-
ever by the sound of the baronets voice
very loud and fierce there came an-
other voice as though in extenuation
the cracking sound of a blow and 
heavy fall dale sprang to his feet as
the door burst open and belville his
handsome face black with wrath his left
arm in a siing came furiously into the
room and ran straight at him

   you fool he screamed  do you
mean youve lost her  he raised his
arm as though to strike

   look out warned dale in a low
voice while through the open door he
watched montague who with a dazed
look on his white and bleeding face
crawled to his feet belvilles hand went
down and he turned away evidently in
disgust when he faced dale again his
features were less contorted though he
was anything but pleasant to look upon

   i thought it was all over and now
it seems that things are worse off than
ever what happened how were you
fool and coward enough to lose her 

   if explanations are to be given
said dale  i think you might begin

   you fool you utter fool explain to
you why ive only to lift my fingers
and youll swing from the gallows

   that sounds very pretty but i fear
you are oversanguine about my death it
is possible that i may be put to that
amount of trouble and inconvenience but
rest assured that i shall take care that

you-

  belville cut him short

   while we are fighting each other
what about this lady to whom the first
sign of publicity may be fatal 

   why 

   because the dead are more easily
hidden than the living

  there was a quality in his tones that
ensh rouded



frightened dale the threat aimed at
himself he could afford to disregard
formidable as it was he felt competent
to defend himself but how if in his
blindness and ignorance he should take
steps that might seem beneficial only to
prove fatal to the unknown girl whom
he loved  

why cant you tell me he broke
out  i dont know how to treat you

i only know i mistrust you he
paused then with a quick gesture of his
hands exdaimed  who is this lady 
 she is the lady replied belville
 whom t intend to marry

   that at least is untrue was dales
retort

  the other started with an angry ex-
clamation and his piercing eyes became
fixed on the young artist then he
flungback his head and laughed

  sits the wind in that quarter he
jeered  my good fellow put such
ideas oat of your head that the lady-
shall become my wife i have sworn the
most solemn oath a man can take

   fortunately observed the other
 from what i have seen of sir george
belville a broken oath more or less can
matter very little

  he turned and walked toward the
door

  belville waited till his hand was on
the knob then he called to him

   where are you going

  to the police since youll tell me
nothing it will be strange if they cant
find out something about all this
belville caught him up with

   and while theyre trying to find out
what will be happening to the poor
girl youve allowed to slip into her
enemies hands

   i see no other way to help her said
dale simply

   have you forgotten that i told you
that the first hint of publicity will almost
certainly cause her immediate death

   how have i the slightest idea that
you are telling the truth

  the other didnt answer but rocked
on his heels before the fireplace his eyes
staring through dale and out of the
window beyond him finally he said
his voice a little softened

   because i love her

  dale winced

   all my life long ive loved two
things-my own pleasure and power over
other men now it seems i must love
a slip of a white-faced girl the more
fool i for my pains

  he fell silent again dale was torn
between a desire to spring  him and
finish him for good and all and a sort
of admiration for the mans love which
when he gave voice to it sounded sincere
here was a rival dale thought whom
were he an honest man it would be
worth while defeating

  belville broke into his thoughts with
 its the princess of course who has
her

  it had been so useless in the past to
find out just who was this princess that
dale though itching with curiosity let
the remark go

   speculation went on the other  is
however useless the practical question
is to rescue her

  the police dale reiterated

  oh tut how often have i said to
you this morning that police interference
is impossible what sense moreover in
pitting them against one of the keenest
braids in europe im not desirous of
having the authorities meddling in this
anyway its too delicate an affair he
paused again and looked keenly at dale

   my dear sir he said suddenly  if
i should propose a treaty of alliance

what-

  alliance with you dale gasped
at the assurance of the man if you
were to propose such a treaty with me i
should know sir george that you were
planning some fresh villainy against me

   not till she was safe said the other
with a somewhat sardonic grin  
am sufficiently in love with that girl to
be honest in getting her if i can get
her no way else cant you see i love
her 

  as he spoke there was truth in his ey 
and in his voice

   i love her too said dale quietly
and if it please heaven no other man
shall win her

   i will win her cried belville
 whether it please or displease heaven
-or her give me your help to save her
now or death may win her from us
both

   what is it that vou want me to do 
	the all-story magazine

   return to london make the ac-
quaintance of the princess the divinely
dangerous the audaciously plain prin-
cess from her you can get a clue to
the girls whereabouts i cant go the
princess would suspect me but you-a
total stranger-can with your youth and
freshness win where i should fail

   we should be good friends-good
allies rather said dale  till the lady

we speak of is rescued after that-

   after that as good enemies as you
wish sir george finished the sentence
dale sat musing in indecision

   how is it he asked after a pause
 that that fellow wilkes seems to be
in your employ now

   a fellow like that is easily won over
by a well-aimed steady pistol said the
baronet carelessly

   who was the woman then the
one disguised as a groom  

   i dont know replied sir george
 i didnt see the body being too busy
nursing this shoulder which some one
slipped a knife into she was an agent
of the princesss i fancy

   ive been imagining this morning
that it might have been the princess her-
self who was it killed her

  the other shrugged his shoulders his
face was not pleasant to look upon

   in such affairs all must take their
chance one strikes practically without
seeing besides how was i to know she
was a woman  

  the brutality of the man struck dale
like a blow the room grew close he
could feel the perspiration break out all
over his body

   i think i will go he said rising
 i think we have talked enough
belville rose too

   win you go to london to see the
princess fianona he asked

  dale walked past him toward the door
without answering the baronet both
amused and annoyed followed him with
his eyes

   you havent told me yet he said
with mock politeness  whether you
agree to my proposition  

  the smile on his face was almost a
leer so that when dale turned to him
he could barely keep from shuddering
afterward it seemed to him that perhaps
this smile was what quickened his deci-

sion  that he felt that the brain behind
it would be less harmful working with
him than against him

  he didnt hide his disgust when he

answered

   i dont understand how i can he
said  but i agree

  the baronet bowed dale opened the
door and passed out into the hall

  on his way out of doors he passed the
obsequious montague his pale eyes
gleaming over the bandage which hid the
cuts on his face

chapter ix

the chase begins

  a day or two after the evelits which
had brought his stay in scotland to such
a sudden end dale was back in his rooms
in london prepared to overcome all
obstacles in his search for the girl

  that on the whole he had done wisely
in accepting sir georges offer he was
now fairly satisfied after all he
persuaded himself he felt no obligation
to avenge the death of the strangely-
disguised woman who had perished in
the fight on the misty hillside and to
have informed the police would but have
entangled himself in a network of compli-
cations just when he had need of perfect
freedom of action

  he quieted that part of his conscience
that questioned his allowing the scotch
fight to remain hidden from the authori-
ties and turned his attention to his quest

  his agreement with sir george had
already proved satisfactory for he had
received from the baronet a communica-
tion requesting him to go that evening
to the  apollo a well-known and fash-
ionable restaurant where arrangements
had been made for him to be introduced
by a certain major bennet to the prin-
cess fianona

  at last he was to meet this redoubtable
person whom now he realized to be the
center of the whole grim business he
felt hope grow in him as the chase be-
came warmer and set out at once to
arrange for an individual hunting party
on his own hook for this purpose he
made his way riverward and climbed to
the top floor of a dingy building

  his knock was answered by an un-
enshrouded



healthy-looking elderly clerk who took
his name and then showed him to an in-
ner room where a little thin man of
tired appearance and bored manner sat
dozing in front of the fire

   oh mr dale he said looking up
and stiiling a yawn evidently with some
difficulty take a seat sir please
yes i had your letter-proud to oblige

any friend of-of- he rummaged

among his papers in a kind of mild
despair at his own forgetfulness  oh
yes of mr rawson

  it was with quite an air of triumph
at having remembered at last that he
brought out the name of the solicitor
who had recommended him to dale as
the smartest and brightest inquiry agent
in the country

   what can i do for you sir  

  you are mr mooney i presume
asked dale hesitating a little to intro-
duce the business on which he had come

  the other nodded

   my name sir he said with a deep
sigh that turned into a yawn and then
he subsided again into a state of apparent
sleepiness being as a matter of fact not
unused to clients who found it somewhat
difficult to state their business

  dale still hesitated hardly knowing
what to say really his chief idea was
to obtain some reserve force on which
to call in any moment of emergency

  he felt too that at present while he
and belville were working together for
one object it was hardiv fair to go to
any one behind his back yet he enter-
tained toward the baronet so deep a mis-
trust that he felt their partnership might
be broker at any minute

    mr rawson he said at last  spoke
very highly of your abilities mr moo-
ney

   yen- good ot mr rawson mur-
mured mooney  but perhaps too good
my ability is slight what i do best is to
sit still most people you know find
that impossible

   well said dale after an ther lent
pause during which little mr mooney
appeared lost in meditation  can you
tell me anything about a lady-the prin-
cess fianona  

   most dangerous woman n europe
replied mooney for the first time show-
ing a sign of real animation

      	s

   in what way 

   in every way replied mooney sink-
ing again into his manner of repose
 sometimes sir after a good dinner or
on a warm summer afternoon  permit
myself pleasant dreams of some dav lav-
ing my hands on that woman but i
never shall too much to hope for-
too much to hope for

  he gave a profound sigh as of a
wizened little peri in tail-coat and trou-
sers gazing into a paradise that he knew
was not for him

  not even by sitting still asked
dale with a faint smile

   not even by sitting still replied
mr mooney with undiminished gravity
 hut if it is about her you want my
advice i can give it you in two words-
steer clear my fee will be ten guinea-
please and you never got more for vour
money either

   but unluckily i cant steer clear
for i am to dine with her this evening

   the iaj gentleman who dined with

her- mused mooney  it cost him

three pound ten that night seven thou-
sand within six rr nths and a bullet
through his brain before the year was out
but he hadnt laid out ten guineas to
such good purpose as you mr dale

   there are circumstances replied the
young artist  tha make it necessary
for me to see as much of her as i can
at present but i should like you to
keep a watch on her and all her move-
ments

  mr mooney rubbed the end of his
nose reflectively and looked more sleepy
than ever

  too vague a commission to have any
good results only as it rather uriously
happens i am watching her already--v
rather her maid

  oh betty brown do you mean
asked dale

   urn said mooney shooting at lta
a quick glance from beneath s hall-
closed lids  you know somethin  -a
mav i ask who gave vou that mo-
tion  

  sir george belville replied dai-
somewhat hesitatingly

   oh sir george belviile -aid
mooney and he seemed to sink into re-
flection so deep as to become quite ob-
livious to the presence of his visitor who


the all-story magazine

presently came to the rather angry con-
iusion that there was little help to be
obtained from this sleepy and meditative
person

  he was just thinking of going when
mooney looked up and remarked

   the combination of princess fia-
nona betty brown and sir george bel-
ville means trouble for some one where
those three are gathered together there is
the devil to pay but i hardly see how
i can help you sir unless youre more
explicit

   im afraid  cant tell you more at
present replied dale  i merely wish
you to take what lawyers i believe call
a  watching brief 

  mooney shook his head and sighed
deeply

   no man he murmured  can do
good work in the dark

  all i feel at liberty to say is that
i have reason to believe that princess
fianona has obtained possession of the
person of a young lady whose very name
i am ignorant of and i cannot imagine
what aim the princess has to serve said
dale  but i do know that there is
some deviltry at work which i intend
to defeat

   a hard thing to do murmured
mooney trying to shift into a more
comfortable position  where sir george
belville is concerned with the princess
fianona i have much affection for them
both especially sir george

   he is a strange man fir in times
of war or adventure or in a position of
danger and responsibility he might have
made a great name for himself but as it
is he is one of the most formidable men
i know of-violent and unscrupulous
yet oddly checked by a crooked sense of
fair play and sportsmanship

   he would ruin a man by the most
subtle treachery and yet face to face
with him you could be assured he would
not lie to you though if you were a
woman he would think lying to you the
best joke in the world on the other
hand he would probably die rather than
strike a woman while i have seen him
beat some unfortunate fellow who he
fancied had been lacking in respect to
him within an inch of his life

   i tell you this sir that you may
realize in how deep water you sail in

the company of princess fianona and
sir george belville two people lie-
added with another deep sigh  for
whom i have a profound admiration and
affection

   but you have not told me yet
whether you will accept my commis-
sion 

   i fear i can do little for you sir
unless you can tel me more

   do you mind telling me why you
are watching this maid of hers   asked
dale  it is possible there might be
some connection between that and the
affair i have come about

   hardly i think answered mooney
 but-of course in the strictest confi-
dence sir-she is wanted by the french
police on a charge cf murdering a
mistress of hers in paris some years ago
a frenchman named acquin was over
here the other day to identify her and
she will be extradited though at present
some legal hitch in france is causing
delay

   in a panic lest she should escape
during this delay the murdered womans
relatives have telegraphed to me to
watch her and on the whole i am
inclined to think miss betty browns
head ought to feel rather loose can you
give me a couple of days to consider your
commission

  dale agreed and went away scarcely
had he gone when mr mooney slipped
into his outer office

   parsons he said to the clerk  how
is my charity account

   you are about seventy pounds to the
good sir replied the clerk after re-
ferring to a ledger

   oh very satisfactory indeed smiled
mr mooney  parsons

    yes sir

   book a bet of a hundred to three
that princess fianona will liave mr
dale her slave ready to kiss her feet at
her nod within-within-well we
give him three months parsons

    es sr said parsons imperturba-
bly making the entry

  a wonderful woman  mused mr
mooney with a kind of restrained
enthusiasm an adorable creature 
could love her myself once i had the
handcuffs on her

  it was an opinion about his future that
enshrouded



had he known it would probably have
rather amused dale for he walking
slowly back to his room was thinking
not at all of the princess but of the
pleading eyes and the sad face memory
of which never left him

  deep in thought he was standing on
the curb waiting a favorable moment
to cross the street when from a han-
som that momentarily slackened its pace
as it passed there leaned forth a woman
heavily veiled and muffled in a huge
cloak that covered her from head to
foot and whispered

  take care beware-oh beware of
driving in a motor-car

  it was her voice

  dale in his astonishment gaped fish-
like and before he could speak the cab-
man lashed suddenly at his horse and
in an instant the hansom was half-way
down the street paying no attention to
the shouts of dale who was running
in pursuit

  another cabman near at hand saw a
chance of earning something substantial

  jump in guvnor he called and
ill catch em for you

  two pounds if you do cried dale
and made one spring into the cab which
at once started at a hot pace rocking
round corners and threading a practi-
cally abandoned course through the press
of the traffic

	now a lumbering omnibus would de-
lay them now a stretch of clear street
would give them an advantage while
dale his hands nervously clutching on
the door-knob ready to spring out asked
himself whether he could have possibly
been mistaken in thinking he had rec-
ognized that soft clear voice which had
uttered so strange a warning

  to his dismay a policeman lifted his
white-gloved hand to stop the traffic
now was the chance for the fugitives
to escape but his driver whipped up
his horse and cut across with a shouted
apology to the policeman to the effect
that he couldnt  old im in so quick
the first cab turned into a side-street
where half-way down the block it
stopped its single occupant jumped
cut wertt lightly up the steps of an un-
pretentious house and in a second was
out of sight in the vestibule

  dales own cab slackened speed and

not waiting for it to stop he took a fly-
ing leap to the pavement luckily kept
his feet and while the passers-by gaped
at the sight of his haste made after the
girl he dashed into the entrance into
which she had gone to find it empty

  on the door was a small brass plate
that bore the words

princess andrette fianona

chapter x

princess fianona

  a strange tumult of fear and of
dismayed bewilderment arose in dales
mind as he saw whither his pursuit had
led him with a kind of sinister derision
it seemed to him the door-plate twinkled
up at him as if mockingly demanding
what reason he imagined had this girl
for flying from him who loved her to
take retuge with her deadliest enemy
who was almost certainly responsible
for her strange and terrible arrival in
scotland

  hampered with hesitation he stood
there on the landing for four or five
minutes at one moment he felt that
he must obtain entrance and discover
certainly who it was he had seen enter
then it seemed to him that this would
be foolish that it might result in conse-
quences all the more dreadful to his
imagination from their very vagueness

  he felt like a man oppressed by a
nightmare struggling with an im-
palpable terror or walking blindfold
among dreadful pits

  then the door opened quietly and
there glided out a little workman carry-
ing a small bag of tools

  dale glanced at him carelessly as he
moved aside to let him pass but as the
man brushed by he whispered

   i can do no good at all you know
sir if you interfere and make her
suspicious

  what mooney exclaimed dale
recognizing the sleepy little detective
who certainly seemed to have shown no
sleepiness in his recent movements

thats me sir he said and it


the all-story magazine

doesnt help a mans disguise to shout
out his name

   did you see that lady who just
entered the flat three or four minutes
ago asked dale eagerly

   yes sir but we cant talk here
replied mooney just follow me
please

  without another word he slipped off
down the stairs and after a moments
vacillation dale followed reflecting that
in the end he could return to the flat if
desirable when he had heard what
mooney knew at any rate the girl
could not be in any immediate danger
since she seemed to be at perfect liberty

  accordingly he went slowly in pursuit
of mooney who after several blocks
were passed dropped back and talked
with the young man

   when you told me what little you
told me sir he remarked  i confess i
did not attach much importance to your
story i have changed my mind now

   you saw that lady then  

   yes answered mooney shooting at
the other an odd and very alert look
from beneath his half-closed eyelids  i
saw her very plainly i was working
in the vestibule when she entered

   thats the one whom i want to
help said dale atremble with excite-
ment  how can i see her and talk
with her shall i go to the house and
ask to see her do you think or shall
i wait till she comes out again  

  mr mooney rubbed the end of his nose
very hard and his air of weary dejection
was more pronounced than ever as he
sighed in response

   that young lady who came in just
about five minutes before i came out in
a big cloak and a great hurry-do you
mean her sir  

   yes and i must speak to her dale
jumped to his feet his face flushed his
voice trembling with eagerness  did
you hear who she was

  her name answered mooney
slowly  is betty brown and she is the
princess fianonas maid

  dale stared at him blankly then
he shot out his arm across the table
and caught mooney by the collar

   do you think this a time for
joking he demanded fiercely

   i never joke said mr mooney in-

dignantly  only fools joke things
being what they are

  dale relaxed his grasp upon the others

collar and then turned slowly toward
the door

   i dont understand he said briefly
 but i dont care to be played with i
wish to have nothing more to do with
you mr mooney i shall go straight
back to the flat and see for myself

   of all the hot-tempered young gen-
tlemen complained the detective
 youre the worst how do you propose
to gain admittance to search a strange
ladys flat

  the other hesitated perceiving that
he had set himself no easy task he
frowned and bit his lip mooney went
on in a slightly brisker tone

   i pledge you my professional reputa-
tion that in the flat at the moment i left
it there was no other person but the
princess herself betty brown who had
just come in and old mrs brown
bettys mother cook and housekeeper to
the establishment and as i believe the
worst of the lot

   but i tell you i saw her go in there
a man must believe his eyes

  not if he knows how often they
deceive him retorted mooney  i
assure you sir i have examined every
room in that flat since i saw you i knew
something was wrong with the electric
light so i represented myself as a work-
man sent to see to it and i went into
every room

   it is only a small flat-two living-
rooms two bedrooms and the kitchen
there is certainly not space to hide a
cat let alone a young lady but there
was one thing sir that has made me
decide to accept your commission if you
still wish it though t had fully made
up my mind to decline

  what is that asked dale whose
certitude was a little staggered by the
detectives positive assurance that the flat
held but the three people he had men-
tioned

   why this said mooney  that
while i was there a gentleman named
bellingham from exeter came to see
the princess

   hes a doctor well known in the
west  believe-an old man with a long
white beard of which he seems very
enshrouded



proud a bit ago his niece and ward
was drowned from one of the irish boats
i happened to be on board and  saw
one or two things that struck me as-
rummy and now when i find him
apparently on intimate terms with
princess fianona i think that is-
rummy too

   they didnt give me a chance to
learn much but i heard dr bellingham
say something was  terribly audacious
and  risky and the princess replied
with that nasty little laugh of hers that
she found it the most profoundly amusing
experience of her life

   and i concluded mooney with a
tremendous sigh  would give a lot to
know what they referred to for it
sounded ugly mr dale-it sounded
terribly ugly

   then youll take my commission to
watch this princess and report anything
suspicious or- unusual   asked dale

   yes sir replied mooney  but you
must understand i cant promise good
results unless vou give me fuller informa-
tion

   thats impossible returned dale
 at present anyway youre simply to
keep her under observation with a view
to discovering the identity and present
whereabouts of a young lady against
whom i believe this woman to be plot-
ting but i can tell you nothing about
the young lady in question except that
i saw her enter the flat just before you
came out

-	 which i know she didnt unless of
course she is identical with the princess
whom i know well with betty brown
whose head sits so loose upon her
shoulders or with bettys mother wicked
old hag that she is moreover if the
princess is plotting against the young
lady you speak of how could it be
possible fot her to take refuge there  
 i must believe what i saw said
dale obstinately

   but what did you see probably
you just mistook betty brown for her
or perhaps the young lady wished to
avoid you and managed to dodge you
they talked a little more then dale
went away to dress for his dinner at the
 apollo  with the mysterious princess

  it was in a mood of some depression
that he made his preparations for certain

as he was that he had made no error-
the very suggestion seemed treachery to
his love-he felt the full baffling force
of the detectives testimony the more
he saw of the matter the blacker it
seemed

  the  apollo  was already full of
diners when he arrived and on the
threshold he was met by major bennet
a tall dissipated-looking man with a
long fair mustache and the reputation of
being able to live more extravagantly
on less money than any other man in
town

  the major though he had met him but
two or three times before greeted him
with the warmth of an old friend and
in a moment or two dale found himself
bowing low as he was presented to the
princess fianona

  he almost imagined there must be
some misunderstanding so different was
she from all his expectations

  in a vague way he had anticipated
some vision of resplendent and fascina-
ting beauty attired fittingly in an
exquisite dress and wearing magnificent
jewels instead he saw a rather plain
heavy-looking woman obviously no
longer young and making no attempt to
conceal the fact on the whole probably
the most dowdily dressed woman in the
room and she was so eagerly intent
upon her dinner that she had hardly a
word to say

  he experienced a vague sense of dis-
appointment until the wonder of her
full lustrous black eyes dawned upon
him and as the meal progressed he
lost his sense of disappointment and
found himself taking far more than his
usual part in the conversation it was
not that the princess herself spoke much
-she hardly said a word till she had
finished her soup and afterward she
conversed chiefly in monosyllables

  but somehow she seemed remarkably
sympathetic showed an interest in her
companions and in particular displayed
so much knowledge of his own pictures
that dale could not help responding it
was not often in his life he had talked
so well and once or twice when the
princess turned her full black eyes on
him with smiling approval of something
he had said he experienced a singular
feeling as though his innermost thoughts


the all-story magazine

were being read-and read with admira-
tion

  the thought crossed dales mind that
possibly there was some mistake about
the alleged criminality of the princess
he wondered whether sir george had
practised some deep treachery and if
she were a victim herself of some obscure
plot

   vou are looking at me very intently
mr dale said the princesss slow voice
 i wonder now if i dare ask you a
favor

   i should be delighted

   thats what you men always say
answered the princess looking at him
as though he were the only person in the
world for whose opinion she had any
regard il yet some day perhaps i shall
ask you to paint my portrait so youre
fairly warned

   i should be delighted again i
should regard it as a great privilege
he repeated it earnestly and it was
as though he heard some small voice
whispering in his ear that it was not only
a motor-car of which it was necessary
to beware

   but how would you make me look 
wonder she asked flashing at him a
very swift and piercing glance  for
they say you know you painters have
such terrible insight into character why
i should be almost afraid

   vou must come to my flat and well
discuss it but not to-morrow for i
intend to go motoring in the afternoon-
 o mote as these fast up-to-date people
say do you care for motoring mr
dale

   no he answered  comparatively
little as a rule i preserve an old-
fashioned love for horses ive not been
in a motor-car for years

   oh she cried clapping her hands
with more animation than she had shown
all through the dinner  then you must
certainly come with me to-morrow and
be converted for mine is an electric car
and so delightful i shall expect you
at three be sure vou do not fail mr
dale

  once more it seemed to him that he
stood upon the curb while a low sweet
voice whispered a strange warning but
the princesss black lustrous eyes were
upon him and it almost seemed as though

they dragged from him by magnetic
force the affirmative he pronounced

   so good of you she murmured and
smiled at him very pleasantly

chapter xl

in shite of warning

  ii was with strange thoughts that at
the appointed hour that afternoon dale
stood waiting on the princesss stairs
he hoped that perhaps the unknown girl
herself would answer his ring but in-
stead a grim old woman appeared

  she was very tall and in spite of her
age seemed still vigorous though the
skin that covered her gaunt hawk-like
features was as yellow as parchment
the hooked nose and the projecting chin
almost met over the cruel thin lips and
as he caught the glance of two pale evil
eyes of a cold blue-gray it seemed to
him that he had either seen them before
or eyes very like them

   mr dale she said without wait-
ing for him to speak  my mistress is
expecting you sir

  she paused and looked him up and
down and then laughed wickedly to
herself

   aye aye she muttered with a
kind of senile malice  she is expecting
you our little andrette

  mumbling something unintelligible
she conducted him to a very pretty and
dainty little drawing-room carried out
in an effective scheme of white and gold

   what an old beldame that woman
does look thought dale to himself
when she had gone instinctively he
took out a pocketbook and began from
sheer force of habit to sketch the old
womans face

   only i hope he muttered as he
paused and surveyed his handiwork  she
doesnt look quite such a fiend as nv
sketch has turned her into somehow

  there was a light step just outside
the door and then a faint restrained
sound of scuffling as if all those who
struggled were equally anxious to avoid
noise it had a strange sinister effect
this soft conflict and subdued muttering
that reached him through the closed door
of the dainty little drawing-room and
a moment he stood intently listening
enshrouded



  then something seemed to touch a fa-
miliar chord in his heart he sprang
hastily toward the door as he put out
his hand it opened suddenly and the
princess dressed for motoring in a neat-
fittirg jacket of moleskin and a heavy
white veil came rustling in

   isnt it too awful mr dale she
said a slightly heightened color on her
cheeks  that intolerable maid of mine
has been drinking again

  dale made no answer but stared at
her stupidly the vague memory that
had awakened in his mind died utterly
away

    would send her off this instant
continued the princess  but it would
break my dear old nurses heart and
after all it is not often betty breaks out
like this

   betty repeated dale like a man
in a dream

   thats her name the princess ex-
plained- betty brown she is my old
nurses daughter and it is only for her
sake i keep betty

   it must certainly be trying said
dale slowly

   i am sorry for the deiay she re-
marked again  i dont want to be
overtaken by the dark

  dale murmured something suitable as
he opened the door for her and then
following her had just closed it behind
him when he seemed to hear the faintest
echo of a cry of pain poignant with in-
expressible agony and yet so low so in-
stantly suppressed that he could not be
certain whether he had heard it at all
and whence it had proceeded or wheth-
er it had not been a trick of an excited
imagination

  but already the princess was in the
street where a smart-looking electric-
car was waiting for them and though
reluctantly enough he saw nothing for
it but to ran down after her as he
assisted her to her seat she suddenly pro-
duced two letters from her capacious
muff

   i had nearly forgotten them she
said  do you mind posting them for
me 

  he walked across to the post-box near
and in slipping them in noticed that the
uppermost one was addressed to sir
george bellville

  at first after he had taken his seat
by the princess he had beer surprised to
see that she intended to drive the car
herseh but he soon perceived that she
was thoroughly competent proceeding
at a moderate pace she kept her ma-
chine well under control steered with
considerable dexterity and showed a
good regard for the customs and courte-
sies of the road

  the more dale studied her the more
he recognized in her a woman of un-
usual mind and character common-
place in appearance dowdy in dress
there was ye about her a curious mag-
netism to which no man could be entirely
indifferent and to which dales sensi-
tive artist nature responded readily

  her gift was not of the beauty of
which men tire but of the mind that
is always fresh and few ever escaped
from her fascination until she herself
threw them away

  as it was she had worked herself
through many disadvantages from her
birthplace in a low liverpool court
where all the evils of life flourished up
to her present position of apparent
wealth and rank through a career where
the mile-stones were the ruined souls
of the men on whom she had smiled as
now she smiled on arthur dale

   mr dale she said suddenly  i
wonder if you know how handsome you
are men are sometimes rather ashamed
of their good looks i hope you arent
 i dont think so he laughed find-
ing her abrupt frankness rather piquant
 are you not afraid of making me
vain  

   now  see you are angry- with
me she remarked with a quaint
grimace  but do not forget im old
enough to be your mother

   hardly  fancy said he laugh-
ing again  seeing i am twenty-five

   and i- she answered  it is

a profound secret you will not be-
tray it will you but i am five years
older in age and two centuries in ex-
perience

   oh well if you are over two hun-
dred years old i am prepared to admit
you might have been my mother

  the orincess after that did most of
the- talking speaking freely and irti-
matelv there was somehow a warmer
the all story magazine

tone in her conversation and it surprised
dale to see how friendly they seemed
to have become on one occasion she
made a half-sad half-bitter reference to
her past life that impressed the young
man with a sense of sympathy toward
one who had suffered

  from what she said it seemed she
had been married young to prince fia-
nona-which appeared to be an ital-
ian title - and dale gathered that
though the prince had been fond of her
he had been a man of vulgar habits and
of an absolute hatred toward artistic
interests which naturally filled so large
a part of her life

   shortly before he died she re-
marked  the poor fellow made me
promise never either to paint or to sketch
again he seemed to be possessed by a
morbid hatred of the arts

   but surely- exclaimed dale

   ah she interrupted  one must
keep ones word thats necessary if one
is to steer straight through this tangled
world especially a promise to the
dead

  what could dale do but how before
so high a display of principle

  almost certain was he now that bel-
ville bad attempted to inveigle him into
a plot against a perfectly innocent wom-
an of the highest character

   he grew quite indignant and in his an-
gry thoughts there was for the time
small room for memories of certain soft
brown eyes however sweet and plead-
ing or of a certain gentle sad face

  they grew even more intimate when
they began to discuss the portrait of the
princess that dale was to paint soon
and then quite suddenly she brought the
car to a full stop

  whats the matter he asked for
into her eyes had come a sudden fear as
though she perceived some danger from
which they bad but barely escaped

    i was thinking she replied  that
wed better turn here and go back

  they were in a deep and narrow lane
in one of those solitary patches of coun-
try still to be found near london to
turn here would be awkward even dan-
gerous for a deep ditch ran by the side
of the road

   dale looked at her in surprise

   its an awkward spot for turning

isnt it hadnt we better run through
that grove of trees in front well prob-
ably find an easier place to turn farther
on

  she agreed with him and started the
car slowly forward

  suddenly he was aware that she was
looking at him curiously though the mo-
ment she realized that he had perceived
she turned hastily

   i didnt make you angry just now
did i she asked softly  when i said
you were so handsome 

   certainly not he answered  why
should you think you had

   i like the lad she murmured her
hands moving restlessly on the steering-
wheel  besides he would add just
the supreme relish to the whole affair-
pay the child out beautifully and give
the lamb a lesson

  then she seemed to remember that
she was muttering aloud and broke off
frowning

    a foolish trick of mine she said
with a forced laugh  i learned it
during three of the most monotonous and
tedious years of my life that i spent once
in france i think we can turn here
she seemed in hesitation as she slack-
ened the speed and her rather heavy
features showed a perplexity even an
alarm quite unwarrantable

   but if you just pass that grove
said he again  turning will be easy
and safe

  again she started the car and this
time it bounded forward rapidly-faster
in fact than it had theretofore traveled

  there was a curious set look on her
face as if the pace made her nervous
he leaned forward to suggest that she
should moderate it and at the same mo-
ment it was as if the car hounded in the
air dale found himself flying through
space to crash headforemost into a small
bush and to the green turf beyond he
lay quite still at first conscious onlv
of a pain in his left arm

  with an effort remembering that the
princess might also be hurt and in need
of help he dragged himself to a crouch-
ing position he vaguely saw two men a
few yards farther on rise from behind
the shrubbery on the roadside and with
bludgeons in their hands come running
toward him
mrs pic ke tts emp iation



  faintly lie recognized in the first of
them wilkes and in the second that
thin red-whiskered man whom he had
seen running in blind panic through the
mist on that night of battle

  between them and him ran the prin-
cess with arms uplifted though whether
in encouragement in defiance or in
greeting he could not tell

 he tried to get to his feet and with
 the motion a terrible pain shot through
 his body

 a tumult of shouting and wild oaths
 reached his deafened ears

 before his fleeting sight floated a cloud
 of pale angry faces and brandished
 weapons

 then he fainted

                         to be continued

mrs picketts temptation

                  by john barton oxfoid

  here in a connivance with
  the criminal turns out to be
  an assistance to the virtuous o

it was a gentle tapping that sounded
at the back door-so gentle indeed
that it seemed almost apologctic yet
at the sound of it mrs pickett started
nervously in her chair and her hands
which were holding a piece of yellowed
paper close to the feeble light of the
lamp began to tremble

  nevertheless she arose and making
her way across the creaking floor of the
tiny kitchen answered the summons

  on the door-step stood a disheveled
young man his clothes covered with dust
and torn by the underbrush of the
woods his shoulders drooped with weari-
ness and a two days growth of stubbly
beard covered his face she noticed with
a little gasp of surprise a small well-
defined scar on the left cheek

  the instant the door had opened the
stranger had removed his battered felt
hat and now he lifted to mrs picketts
face a pair of very tired blue eyes

   good evening he said in a low
voice which also had something of apol-
ogy in it  i hope i havent startled
you can you get me something to eat
im willing to pay you for it he added
in smiling explanation

  she looked at him doubtfully for a

moment her heart was pounding madly
and she felt her knees weakening beneath
her a second glance however gave
her courage he was not a large man
and moreover he was very plainly tired
out his face too had an expression of
almost childish frankness

  mrs pickett swallowed what few of
her misgivings remained and stepped
back from the door

   come in she said holding it open
for him to enter  i guess maybe i
can accommodate you

  the young man shuffled into the little
kitchen and sank into a chair against
the wall with a sigh of relief in the
fuller light of the room his appearance
was even less disquieting than it had
been on the door-step

  despite the fact that he was covered
with dust and haggard and unshaven
there was something rather attractive
about his face the last of mrs pick-
etts apprehensions vanished as she began
to bustle about preparing the meal the
stranger sat very quietly in his chair
his head tilted back against the wall anil
his eyes closed presently his hat slipped
from his hand to the floor and mrs
pickett looking up from the place she
was setting at the table saw he was
asleep

  a grim light came into her eyes she
tiptoed cautiously to the sleepers side
and stood looking down at him

   guess i didnt have no call to
be scared of him she muttered half
aloud  that is if it really is him

she added

  she moved noiselessly to the dork on
the mantel-shelf and from beneath it
drew a paper-a copy of a circular she
had seen at the post-office two days be-
fore she had copied the circular that
she might recognize this man and avoid
him that she might lock herself in the
house in case he appeared in the vicinity

  that she would ever assume the of-
fensive in the event of meeting him had
been the farthest thing from her mind
now that he was here such a course
seemed absurdly easy-he was so frail-
looking and so altogether worn out she
unfolded the paper and ran her eyes
over the description it contained fitting
it bit by bit to the sleeping man before
her

    five feet seven and a half she
read  that parts all right  weight
one hundred and forty-six pounds
looks most too pindling for that but
maybe he does  blond hair and blue
eyes that fits to a t  sandy com-
plexion vou cant tell nothing about
that hes so sunburnt but it might be
sandy jut as well as not  small scar
on left cheek if i had any doubts i
guess that would settle em i guess
its him all right and i guess i might
just as well have the reward as anybody
else there aint nobody who needs it
any worsen i do thats one thing cer-
tain

  she dropped the paper into the fire
and then put the supper she had pre-
pared onto the table after which she
shook the sleeping man into wakeful-
ness

   	your suppers ready now she said
as he sat up staring about him stupidly

he rubbed his eyes and for a moment
seemed trying to collect his scattered

senses

   supper  ah yes thank you he
said at length he drew a chair to the
table and began eating hungrily like a
man half famished

  mrs pickett sat watching him nar-
rowly she was perfectly cool there
v as not a trace of agitation about her
very deliberately she planned it out in
her mind she would offer to get him
-me fresh water then as soon as this
ruse had got her clear of the house she

would go to the wood-shed and load the
double-barreled gun

  as soon as he had finished his supper
she would order him lo the front room
and mount guard over him until such
time in the early morning as she could
summon aid from the workmen on their
way to the quarry

  no sooner had the plan formulated
itself in her mind than she proceeded to
act upon it she got hurriedly to her
feet and lifted the water-bucket from
its shelf by the sink

   maybe youd like some fresh wa-
ter  she hazarded

   dont bother said the man between
mouthfuls  ill get it myseli if i
want any

   id just as soon she said and
slipped out of the house

  once outside she set the bucket on
the ground softly opened the door of
the wood-shed and cautiously felt her
way through the darkness of the place
to the corner where the old shotgun rest-
ed in the angle of the walls fumbling
about on the shelf above her head she
found the box of shells snapped the
breech open and thrust one into either
barrel then she made her way out of
the wood-shed and stood panting in the
back yard

  through the kitchen-window she could
see her unsuspicious guest still eating
hungrily at the table a sudden wave of
compunction seized her her knees be-
gan to tremble but by sheer force of
will she stilled the tumult of her mind

  he aint nothin to me she told
herself angrily  i hadnt ought to
have no fool qualms about sendin him
back if i dont do it some one cer-
tainly will an i need that money-
lord knows how i need it

  she crossed the yard to stop irresolute-
ly again at the back door three times
she essayed to lift the latch but each
time her arm fell back to her side with
the simple deed still unaccomplished

  the man had finished his meal and
was pushing back his chair mrs pick-
ett took up the gun and with a heart
pounding violently against her ribs
opened the door and entered the kitchen
llie mans eyes widened in surprise
they fixed themselves finally on the
rutv shotgun in mrs picketts hands
mrs picketts temptation



   its loaded she said very grimly

  the young man smiled in deprecating
fashion

   im mighty sorry ive frightened
you he said gravely his eyes still on
the gun

   you aint scared me none mrs
pickett returned then very deliberate-
ly she cocked the gun and raised it to
her shoulder  youd better be goin
now she commanded

  the young man seemed not in the
least perturbed he looked quite stead-
ily into the barrels of the gun and then
at the woman

   i guess youve made some sort of a
mistake he began

   i aint made no mistake mrs
pickett returned  youd better go an
go quick before i change my mind
again i know who you are youre
dave samson you got out of the peni-
tentiary at danville day before yester-
day theyre huntin for you all around
these parts now an theres a cirkeler
down to the post-office givin a descrip-
tion of you an offerin a reward of a
hundred dollars for your capture i
knowd you soons i clapped my eyes on
you you cant fool me youd bet-
ter go

  her guest stood before her smiling
quietly he made no motion to leave
instead he put his hand into his pocket
and drew out a handful of silver and be-
gan picking out some coins

   how much is my supper  he asked
calmly

   i dont want your money said mrs
pickett  you keep it like enough
youll have need of it before you get
away from em now youd better start
right off youre temptin of me every
minute that youre staying here i need
money very much theres a mortgage
on this house an the interest is long
overdue

   theyre goin to foreclose on me if
i cant raise fifty dollars before next
wednesday when you come here to-
night i was figgerin it up an prayin
that i might get that fifty in some way
but i aint a goin to get it in no such
way as this i aint goin to send you
back to danville for the sake of havin
it now you go d yer hear you go

  the young man looked at her thought-
fully for a moment then he picked
up his battered hat and opened the back
door on the threshold he turned
mrs pickett with the gun still held to
her shoulder was watching him with
steady eyfes

   im much obliged to you i shant
forget it he said quietly and disap-
peared into the darkness

  she heard his dragging footsteps cross-
ing the yard suddenly she put down
the gun and ran to the back door

   say you she called

   yes came a voice out of the dark-
ness  what is it 

   voud oughter be careful about goin
to houses she cautioned  an if you
was to take some of the outside shells
of shagbarks an grind em up between
your hands an rub em on your hair
twould darken it up considerable

   thanks the voice returned simply
she heard him crashing through the
underbrush at the edge of the woods
she listened intently until the sounds
grew fainter and finally died away
then she sank down on the door-step and
wept weakly

  two days later sirs pickett opened
a letter addressed to her at the post-
office and stood staring stupidly at a
fifty-dollar bill pinned to the bit of scrib-
bled paper within it was some time be-
fore she could collect herself sufficiently
to read the brief note written in a sprawl-
ing hand

  mrs pickett

   dear madam i was not dave sam-
  son as you seemed to think as you
  will see by my signature i am a deputy
  sheriff of this county i got samson
  the next night after id had supper
  at your house it was a good supper

  i dont know when i ever enjoyed one
  more but for your hospitality i could
  never have kept on samsons trail and
  finally run him down permit me
  therefore to enclose half the reward
  which it seems to me iieiongs to you

  a mist rose to mrs picketts eyes a

stoutly  but maybe ill borry it for a

chapter ix

cormilifs kerrigan inhabits a tal-
    a   m half an hour and dona
    beaiiuz defies the president to
    the great glee of quintin sa-
    riol whom she invites to at-
    tend iier wedding

th e city of the golden spires was
sparkling in the morning sun-
shine when two dusty iraveling-
carriages drew up before the
great pink-marble palace which looks
loftily across the plaza principale

  cornelius kerrigan helped fifi from
the first of these and karl von rudolf
stood bowing by the other while the pres-
ident alighted

  beatriz came forth also but without
availing herself of the hand extended
by her august relative

bcfran february all-story m

   they all went up the steps together
and the guard presented arms while such
of the populace as were astir and pass-
ing through the square peered in upon
them from behind the gilded railings
gaping at the spectacle but giving no
sign or sound of approval for the
tigers yoke pressed full heavily upon
the common people but as they reached
the pillared portico and there came run-
ning forth to greet them one who had
been watching from within a cry of
 viva sariol  resounded from the
background and ybarra bit his lips

   the black frown faded from his face
however as he shook hands warmly with
the effusive newcomer and turning to
his cousin he said ceremoniously

     i have the honor to present to you
don quintin sariol vice-president of
the republic and my most valued friend
a e a  i o c sinele copits  cents
clipping the tigers claws



   i kiss your hands i am your hum-
ble servant declared sariol with
breathless volubility  but have you
heard ybarra that the englishman is
hard at your heels pray pardon my ab-
ruptness sefwrita but we live in
troublous times and it is for his excel-
lencys welfare

   what is the latest from la boca
asked the president cutting him short
 has any message reached you from
the pass

   the wires are down said sariol
without attempting to suppress the mal-
ice in his voice  there will be no
more messages in the meantime im
afraid

  ygnacio ybarra glared at him but
made no other comment on the news

   order fresh horses von rudolf he
snapped over his shoulder

  the general coolly transmitted the
order to an adjacent sentry in a tone of
indifferent contempt he was  lackey
and though it pleased him for the pres-
ent to ride at the head of the presiden-
tial life-guards he was ready and will-
ing to show this south american savage
that it was karl von rudolf and not
a menial who wore his livery

  nor was his excellency slow to realize
that he had made a false step

   i wish youd take my cousin in to
breakfast karl he said in a concilia-
tory tone  ive business to discuss with
quintin here show those two also
where to find food if you will

  fifi and kerrigan followed without a
word as beatriz moved forward on von
rudolfs arm and after she had been be-
stowed within the presidents private
apartment they were shown into an ad-
joining room wherein was spread a re-
past at the sight of which cornelius
whistled mellifluously

   no more chop-sooy and cheap rapid-
fire meals for mine it suits me better
to inhabit a pink palace

  von rudolf shot a swift inquiring
glance at fifi and withdrew

  ybarra did not waste much time over
affairs of state with the vice-president
he rejoined beatriz within ten minutes
and having seen that all her wants were
supplied dismissed the servants helping
himself from the buffet before lie sat
down beside her

   listen my cousin he said sharply
and she looked up at him in obvious as-
tonishment  there is no time for fur-
ther trifling and we must understand
each other clearly the crisis approaches
fast  have not weeks to woo you in
i have no option but to act you know
that i intend to marry you and that our

union will save san benito from-

  she interrupted him with flashing
eyes

   peace man  she cried  and do
not perjure your unfortunate country

   you know that i will never marry
you not even in order to fill your
empty purse you know that if you are
forced from your dictatorship to-mor-
row san benito will be better off than
it is to-day

   you know that my troth is pledged
elsewhere and let me tell you since
there is no time for further trifling that

i	hold my least pledge sacreji would
you could say as much 

  his face grew livid as she thus defied
him for heretofore their intercourse had
been more guarded and he had never
doubted that in time he would be able
to achieve his object her allegiance
to his rival set forth thus in words for
the first time was in itself sufficient to
provoke him to the point of frenzy

  who was this english dog that would
dare to beard the tiger of san benito

   cuerpo de dios swore the presi-
dent  ill free you from your troth
fair cousin and no least pledge will bind
you to a lifeless body without there
chamberlain tell father agust in he
is to travel with us we leave for the
golden horseshoe within five minutes
let the people know that i shall bring
back a wife-the dona beatriz ybarra
the official who had come at his call
went hastily to carry out his orders
when the travelers set forth again there
was a priest in their company

  all the church-bells were ringing
wildly at the street-corners there win-
cheering crowds his excellencys wa-
ning popularity had apparently received
a fillip and that in the nick of time

  but quintin sariol standing on the
palace-steps whence he had sped the
couple whose announced engagement
had so pleased the fickle populace
laughed with low glee


the all-story magazine

  the fool he said speaking thus
disrespectfully of his superior  the
stupid fool-to think that such a woman
would defy him with mere words

  a long days journey took the tired
travelers into the far recesses of that great
sirrra whose volcanic peaks look down
on five republics von rudolf faith-
ful to his task went with them all the
way and it was well he did since within
a wild ravine they were beset by a strong
body of insurgent infantry wild moun-
taineers of no mean marksmanship who
under efficient leadership might have put
period to this history there and then

  but after a fierce contest they were
driven from their coigns of vantage with
only the death of a dozen government
troopers to their credit the pass was
picketed fresh horses were harnessed in
the place of those which had fallen un-
der fire the two women came forth from
among the rocks where they had been
led to shelter and they reached safety
without further accident

  the golden horseshoe so called
from its shape was an enormous cup-
like hollow scooped by some eternal
power out of the sheer cliff-face which
spread for leagues on either side of it
and towered mistily above its only
opening looked across the intervening
hilltops toward cruz alta and was
guarded by a ridge of rock through
which a narrow entrance had been
blasted by the hand of man

  within lay an almost circular expanse
of level pasture watered by a stream
which showed like a white thread against
the golden rock five hundred feet above
sheer in the center there rose from the
green plain a steep unscalable islet of
stone an altar to the gods pushed up
entire out of the solid earth upon this
stood a number of low white buildings

  with a sufficient garrison at the open-
ing of the horseshoe the place was abso-
lutely impregnable and it was ybarras
property he had been born there on
liis fathers hacicntla and still farmed
the fertile acres which encircled his old
home

   is this the local sing-sing asked
kerrigan staring about him in blank
amazement  it wont be easy to break
out at any rate did you ever see such
a place fifi  

   its very wonderful the girl an-
swered gently her eyes on the golden
glow cast by the setting sun upon the
stupendous walls about her

  their carriage stopped under the
fortress-like shadow of the central height
and they alighted ybarra and his
cousin took the lead and all slowly des-
cended a steep winding staircase cut in
the solid rock

  it was a long climb to the top but
once there they could not restrain the
exclamations of surprise that rose to
their lips as the full beauty of the scene
displayed itself

  even ybarra was touched for an in-
stant as he looked back toward the city
of the golden spires all glittering in the
tender sunset beyond the blue hills in
between

 	you will be happy here my
beatrix  he whispered she turned
from him with a faint gesture of con-
tempt

   not with you she answered stead-
ily

  her hand was on her heart against
which nestled a fragrant faded rose

  cornelius had not failed to notice that
the stair was well guarded he saw the
twinkling camp-fires on the inside of the
ridge that encompassed the golden
horseshoe but noticed that in addition
to the sentry at the top of the steps
there seemed to be no armed men on the
plateau

   its safe enough without them he
mumbled disconsolately  no visitors
without wings will trouble us here id
hate to go too near the edge on a dark
night

  there were wide unkempt gardens
about the white buildings and beyond
those a thicket of low trees which shel-
tered them from any sudden blast

   two acres and a cow-on the top
of a perch   kerrigan remarked to fifi
and showed her the quadruped in ques-
tion-a draft-ox at the windlass of a
well

  once within the walls however they
forgot the strangeness of their situation
in the midst of solid comfort ill kept
as the surroundings seemed to be there
was no detail missing in the interior of
the rambling dwelling

  servants were waiting to receive
clipping the tigers claws

them all were treated with considera-
tion the women were taken charge of
by two maids the president had two
men to attend him and cornelius one
the priest seemed to have betaken him-
self elsewhere for the time being

  but he appeared again at dinner-time
and ate below the salt with the two
others while beatriz sat with her cousin
at a separate table

  it was a silent meal and every one
was glad when it was over ere they
separated for the night however
ybarra took the opportunity to explain
his plans and dispositions

   you know the rules dom agustin
he said turning his chair to face the
other table you mr kerrigan may
learn from the holy father my poor
house here with all that it contains is
at your disposal so long as you do not
transgress my rules

   i have come hither to attend a wed-
ding-my own with dona beatriz ybar-
ra it will take place within our private
chapel to-morrow night at this hour
dom agustin will marry us and you two
will attend as witnesses

   ladies and gentlemen i give you the
good night

  he arose and left them sitting
dumbly conscious of their helplessness
in his hands presently the women went
also weary enough to forget their
troubles in sleep

  kerrigan was fatigued almost beyond
endurance but he sat on for an hour
and sucked a very sound cigar that the
priest had produced hoping to extract
therefrom some temporal comfort

  ybarra seemed to have forgotten that
neither could understand the other and
the rules of which he had spoken could
not therefore be imparted to the
stranger wjthin his gates father agus-
tn knew no english kerrigan little
spanish they compounded on such
few words of latin as the actor still
carried in his memory and having ex-
hausted these parted with mutual com-
passion very little the wiser for their
intercourse

  it was late next morning before cor-
nelius awoke and having breakfasted at
the instigation of his servant in his own
apartment he went out into the garden
to smoke

   fifi and beatriz were there before him
pacing an open path together chatting
in low tones with ever and anon an
anxious glance in the direction of cruz
alta

   you havent a revolver have you
mr kerrigan fifi asked as he ap-
proached

   i have that he answered cheer-
fully but why

   would you-will you let me have it
this evening beatriz begged impul-
sively but he shook his head

   excuse me miss ybarra he re-
plied  but-if theres any shooting to
be done ill do it myself now dont
mistake my meaning im going to be
best man at this interesting ceremony to-
night and it will be my painful duty to
show cause why the ceremony should be
stopped by the simple but effective
method of corpsing the chief performer

  if you see me stoop to tie my shoe-
lace stand fast-and dont scream

  she shuddered in the sunshine

   there you are you see he added
 youd be far too nervous

   i meant it for myself-not him
she whispered  that would be the
easier way

  he shook his head decidedly

 im going to be best man he re-
peated  leave all the details to me
a flash as of lightning flared up from
above cruz alta and was followed by
others in steady succession

  whats that fifi asked curiously
 its been going on all morning

   somebody jiggling a shaving-mir-
ror in the sun cornelius answered from
the depths of his superior knowledge
 perhaps theyre trying to signal
thats it sure a heliograph of
course theyre talking to us here i
only wish i could read it

   beatriz  cried a voice from the
veranda behind and turning they saw
the president

   our good friend quintin sariol
sends his respects and asks me if lie
may attend our wedding shall i say
yes

    say yes cornelius whispered to her
from behind and on the impulse of the
moment she nodded and his excel-
lency looked well pleased

   im glad youre agreeable he re-

marked and went back again to where
at oue side of the house a field telegraph-
ist was receiving and answering the
distant signals

  the day passed somewhat drearily
despite strong efforts on the part of all
to show at least an outward unconcern
the two girls dreaded in anticipation
the seemingly inevitable tragedy that
every hour was bringing nearer ker-
rigan was cudgeling his brains for some
faint semblance of a plan to prevent the
atrocious wrong ybarra was ready to per-
petrate

  he knew too well that it would be
but by a miracle that he could hope to
carry out his wild idea of shooting the
wrongdoer down on the steps of the
altar his excellency was by far too
clever too well accustomed to such meth-
ods to afford him any opportunity of
using the ineffectual weapon he had
strapped to his ankle he had done this
with the idea that he might be searched
come what might he could not let the
victim of the wrong take her own life

   id throw myself off this cliff if it
would help her he reflected wretchedly
 but as things are that would be worse
than a useless sacrifice well have to
wait and see what happens

  the dinner-hour came round relent-
lessly and with it father agustin ap-
peared again the five of them sat
mutely through it and after coffee had
been served ybarra rose

   come cousin he said coldly

  she followed him without a word

  the priest went next and after him
walked kerrigan with fifi leaning heav-
ily on his arm

   you mustnt faint he said to her
in an anxious whisper as they passed
through a long passage  be brave-
for just a little while longer

  she shook convulsively but soon her
steps grew steadier and he was able to
spare a morsel of mental advice to his
own raw nerves

   keep cool you shivering snipe  he
said savagely to himself  and when the
time comes act like a man

they went downward into the earth
by steps that were slippery with damp
and gray with mildew toward soft mu-
tiiat came as if from behind closed
doors

   a merry sort of marriage-in a
catacomb  commented kerrigan in-
wardly  liut all the more convenient
for a funeral

  a double door in front moved noise-
lessly back upon its hinges a blaze of
light burst through kerrigan crossed
the threshold of the church behind the
priest and stared about him blindly for
a moment as he moved toward the altar

   it was indeed a most surprising scene
that met his view

   a cave in the interior of the table-
land on which the hacicnda buildings
stood had been converted in the course
of many lifetimes into a chapel perfect
in every detail from the most intricate
carving of the massive pillars to the
grained arches of the natural roof the
loving labor of centuries had gone to
make the cave a casket worthy of its
purpose

  it was a masterpiece-a monument to
-the dead men who had perfected it

   the crash of a great organ echoed in
the vault above and many voices were
uplifted in a curious chant the edi-
fice was full to overflowing and the ef-
fect was almost deafening

   ybarra stopped before the altar and
his cousin faced him as the priest passed
up the steps fifi would have gone for-
ward but he held up his hand and from
the ranks of men in uniform on either
side four stepped forward

  two tackled kerrigan and in such
wise that he had little chance to strug-
gle the other two took each a hand
of fifis holding her gently where she
was

  the whole affair had been stage-
managed to ajirto and beatriz ybar-
ra looking wildly about her saw all
chance of escape cut off

  the singing ceased and at that in-
stant there came thrusting up the aisle
don quintin sariol in boots and spurs
and breathless from his journev

   in his great haste he had forgotten to
doff his hat and when he did so it was
too late to stay him in his purpose

   let no man move a finger or i
fire  he cried and no man did move

   for he had the prospective bridegroom
by the throat at arms length and with
his head bent back upon the altar in
his right hand he held a cocked revolver
clipping the tigers claws

with the muzzle making a white mark on
the prospective bridegrooms forehead

  for a tense moment- this endured
then ybarra spoke quite calmly

    youre earlier than i expected ar- 
mytage he said  i wish you wouldnt
press so hard upon your pistol

chapter x

don quintin sarioi shows curiosity
    and suffers the consequences
    without complaint while joa-
    quin gonzalez shows the white
    feather

   it had struck quintin sariol as high-
ly humorous that his superior in the
executive of san benito should have as-
sumed the task of bending beatriz
ybarras will to his

   the wedding ceremony will be en-
tertaining-to the spectators the vice-
president told himself and grinned
across the table at his secretary

   make me a cipher message to his
excellency he commanded  say that
affairs of state will take me to the gold-
en horseshoe on the instant and that
i hope to reach his side in time to at-
tend his nuptials

   afterward order horses-three re-
lays

  and any escort asked the man of
letters

    ill take two orderlies von rudolf
and his men have doubtless left the road
safe and-im not afraid

   he left the room to change his clothes
for the journey and his underling
glanced after him through gold-rimmed
glasses

    youre a deep well don quintin
said that worthy to himself  and if
you meet a few reds by the way it will
not inconvenience you i only wish i
knew which of you is coming out on top

  there was an answer to the message
waiting when sariol came in again

    at half past nine to-night it said
and that was all

    ill start at once and dine with them
at eight it will be amusing to watch
them together he reflected mischiev-
ously and so set forth

he made good speed upon the jour-
ney finding fresh horses ready for him

     	s

at each stage and sunset saw him at the
entrance of the gorge wherein the presi-
dent had been attacked the day before

   well wait on this side until dark
comes down lie told his scanty escort
 it will be safer then than in the half-
light

  he threw his reins to one of the two
troopers and sauntered along the road-
side smoking contentedly as they
ensconced themselves behind a boulder
to avoid unfriendly observation

  a hundred yards away he too sat
down and looked about him curiously

  suddenly his attention became concen-
trated on a split tree-trunk not a stones
throw from where he was sitting he saw
clearly a brown gun-barrel resting upon
the fork and behind it two white eye-
balls that were fixed steadily on the top
left-hand pocket of his waistcoat

  he did not stir nor yet cry out be-
cause he had already recalled to mind
the unfortunate fact that a warm wind
was blowing from behind him where-
fore his voice might not carry far in
that direction

 he did not move when he heard
stealthy footsteps on the splintered shale
among the undergrowth at one side

  when a sharp voice said  hands
up  he held his hands up promptly

  some one behind him drew the pistol
from its holster in his belt and having
made sure he had no other arms con-
cealed about him said suavely

   thank you i think you may drop
your hands now if you wish but dont
make any noise

  the speaker stepped in front of him
a slim youth in the uniform of an officer
of cavalry and sariol looked non-
plused for the first time

   what means this outrage senor
tcnicntc  he asked stiffly  is the
vice-president of san benito to be
treated thus by soldiers of the repub-
lic

   call up your men and order them
to lay their arms down his captor or-
dered as if he had not heard and
sariol did so

  the troopers tramped along on foot
leading the horses and stared up to
where he was sitting

they handed their weapons over at a
word from him and werebidden to


the all-story magazine

face about and get back to cruz alta
at top speed on loot a thing they set
out to do without delay being only too
thankful that their throats had not been
cut

  but sariol was led still smoking
philosophically into the presence of
major armytage who seemed pleased to

see him

   we met in cruz alta three years
ago don quintin said that gentleman
in response to sariofs puzzled inquiry

  the vice-president looked relieved

  my old friend don antonio he
exclaimed i am delighted i might
have known but then your men are
wearing our new uniforms von rudolf
will be jealous if you dont look out
and when he hears how you rode
through cruz alta in-pataploum
out-zass he will be almost cross
with you youre brave my old friend
and as they say none but the brave de-
serve-success	

   ybarras at the golden horseshoe 
armytage asked as they sat down to-
gether by a deadwood fire within a hol-
low on the hillside

   he is and it may interest you to
know that he intends to wed the dona
beatriz to-night the hour is set for
half past nine and i was on my way to
the ceremony

  he turned his head to hide the mali-
cious grin called forth by the majors
startled malediction

   its only half past seven now he
added tentatively looking at his watch
 fbere is still time

   excuse me for five minutes his host
interrupted and calling corbyn over
from an adjacent lire held whispered
conversation with him

  don quintin made no demur when
he was presently requested to exchange
his clothes for a full cavalry uniform
he yielded-up his papers without pro-
test and supplied the correct counter-
sign as if he had been performing an
agreeable duty which in part he was
since any misfortune which might over-
take ybarra would help his own suc-
cession whereas otice the president had
the mastery of his cousins millions he
himself might look for a short shrift

  it therefore suited his own hand to
help the englishman and when that

  rash spirit rode forth on his risky er-
rand he knew all that quintin sariol
could tell him concerning current dis-
positions at the golden horseshoe that
did not amount to a great deal since his
excellency had always been astute enough
to guard the secrets of his final refuge
very jealously but armytage was glad
to gather all the details thus available

  the night passed quietly after he had
gone and don quintin made himself
quite at home with his remaining hosts
he was at worst a cheerful scoundrel
with few illusions as to honesty in walk
or conduct

   in san benito we are not yet civil-
ized he said to allardyce as they sat
smoking  and might is right my
friend ybarra rules with a high hand
and he has von rudolf to help him but
now that there is a woman in the case
we may see changes

   lopez of paraguay was still alive
when i was born and he had cause to
curse the petticoats before he died
ybarra also calls himself  the tiger
but as for me  need no alias when
the time comes i shall be merely sariol
the president and at your service
always

  the bait was clumsy allardyce ig-
nored it and the other said no more

  next day hung very heavily on the
hands of those who were waiting the
news which did not come

  the orders left by armytage with his
subordinates were that they should stand
fast for four and twenty hours where-
after failing receipt of word from him
they were to act as should seem to them-
selves most fitting

  when dusk came down again corbyn
and allardyce consulted long and anx-
iously with them now lay responsibil-
ity for the next step and twenty lives as
well as their own depended on their
decision wise or unwise

   lets put it to the others first cor-
byn suggested after they had formed a
plan wh -e sheer foolhardiness had for
sole excuse the lack of any one more
feasible and his friend readily approved
the proposition

   you talk to em old chap said
allardyce  and ill look after the vice-
president

  corbyn agreed and to the group
clipping the tigers claws



which gathered round him while the
englishman relieved the guard explained
the matter thus

   the games against us boys at this
stage and were going to chance a bluff
you know how weak our hand is and
ill tell you honestly that it may cost us
all our chips if any of you feel like
coming in its boot and saddle right
away but well think none the worse of
those that stand out

  he stooped and loosened his own
horses halter from the picket-line led
allardyces also to the spot where their
accouterments were stacked and got both
ready for the road some one had
saddled sariols before he went back for
it there was much noiseless bustle in the
neighborhood and when he numbered
off the ready rank in front of him there
were just twenty men who had made up
their minds to go the limit

   theres no four-flushers in this
bunch said a gruff voice reprovingly

  corbyn laughed softly as he answered
 thats a sure thing mcguire

  they led their mounts all fresh and
willing after the long rest down to the
roadside where they were on the point
of starting southward when from the
direction of cruz alta there was audible
the thud of many hoofs the clank of
metal the echo of an angry order

  out of the shadows which lay thick
in the ravine appeared two shaggy heads
bent beneath wicked-looking horns and
swaying to and fro on heaving shoul-
ders slavering lips blew steamy breath
almost in corbyns face before he real-
ized that he saw nothing more night-
marish than mountain-oxen a span
of twenty shuffled past the rear-
most yoke bent almost to the earth be-
neath the weight of a high two-wheeled
cart

  the driver was on foot wielding both
whip and goad perched up above him
on the vehicle there was a woman
quarrelsomely inclined to judge by the
way in which she presently began to rate
him for their slow progress the man
made no reply beyond redoubling his
efforts to hasten the pace of his leisurely
team

  halt there cried allardyce and
at the words dark figures darted out
upon the driver who obeyed with busi-

ness-like celerity the woman sat quite
still and did not even scream

  corbyn ran up

   drop that gun he said to her in
english  ive got you covered climb
down quick 

  his tone was ominous and she did as
she was bidden descending from her
perch with the agility of a young girl

   who-who are you  she asked her
accents thin and shaky as she peered in-
tently at the uniforms about her

  and corbyn snapped  shut up
gonzalez dont ask silly questions

  he had recognized his enemys voice

  a hurried consultation resulted in the
release of the wagoner who proved to
be a stupid peasant pressed into the
present enterprise at pistol-point and he
made off rejoicing after he had handed
oyer all his passengers property con-
sisting of a rifle a rusty revolver and a
full suit of mans apparel

  as to gonzalez they were in two minds
till sariol begged speech of allardyce
and helped them to a prompt decision

   where are you taking me  the spy
asked fearfully of the two troopers who
had bound his hands and were now
thrusting him toward a point where the
highway hung starkly over a deep gorge
within whose unseen depths a mountain
stream made mournful music he tot-
tered as he walked his teeth were chat-
tering great beads of perspiration be-
dewed his pallid face in his ridiculous
disguise he made a singularly unattract-
ive picture and they who had heard of
the hilario answered sternly to a
safe place

  he gave vent to a groan and would
have fallen but for their support

  at the edge of the precipice they
dropped him a huddled heap and drew
back while a half-circle of their com-
rades hemmed him in with ready rifles

  corbyn had charge of the firing-
party

   get up gonzalez he adjured the
guilty wretch who was groveling wildly
at their feet

   dont shoot dont shoot seiior 
that coward screamed  show mercy
for a moment its worth your while
ill swear dont shoot ill buy my
life from you ill tell you evetything
dont shoot 


the all-story magazine

   theres nothing you can tell us we
dont know said corbyn  for the
last time stand up

   my god but wait protested the
doomed man  ill tell you how to
reach the senorita ill take you through
the golden horseshoe

   if you could take us through the
golden horseshoe we might spare you-
for the present corbyn interpolated in
a most disbelieving tone  but since

you cant-

   i can i can gonzalez urged

 there is a way-

  take him along with you said the
american contemptuously and at the
words the whimpering poltroon was
picked up and led away

  to the vice-president they bade a brief
farewell before they started and he ex-
pressed great pain at parting

   yes ill go straight back to cruz
alta he assured them  i do not pine
to interfere between you and the tiger
although i should have liked to look
on-from a distance

   some day i may be able to serve
you caballeros until then discretion
eh that which has passed is safe as
between gentlemen command me to
his excellency good-by

  he went his way on foot chuckling
contentedly and they silently on into the
mountains

  gonzalez had no horse and they had
none for him he tramped along his
wrists fast to the stirrup-leathers of the
leading files and was most useful there
for at two different points the road was
picketed he gave them timely warning
of the fact and they were able to pass
onward unmolested at sole cost of a
short detour in each case

  at three in the morning they were
within long range of the ridge enclosing
the hacienda

   there are two regiments behind it
he told them in a terror-stricken whis-
per  that foreign devil von rudolf
is in command we must bear west
to where the stream comes forth and

then-

  he hesitated

   what then  demanded corbyn
suspiciously

   there is the tunnel it flows through
   which will be guarded 

   there is no guard sen or that is
the secret with which i have bought my
life

  he looked up furtively and licked his
dry lips well knowing that the secret
might be worthless

   your life will be short unless we get
safely through corbyn said grimly

  leaving the road their way lay
through the broken country at the base
of that gigantic peak within whose skirts
the hacienda was hidden soon they had
to dismount and lead their horses but
in time they came to the shallow gorge
through which the crystal torrent re-
sponsible for the due irrigation of its
acres had exit

  there was no great head of water run-
ning and gonzalez gasped relief had
the great sluice within the ridge been
wide there would have been small hope
for him

   youll have to leave your horses he
explained

  where asked allardyce

   there is an opening in the bank
see-there with grass and water in
abundance

  it was too late to balk at details and
they left the animals behind hiding the
saddles as best they could

  a breathless scramble up the bed of
the stream took them to a low cavern in
the cliff-side they entered blindly

  gonzalez led the way a stirrup-leather
fast about his waist  allardyce held an
end of it in one hand while in his other
was a cocked revolver

   make no false steps observed that
anxious follower  lest i should blow
your brains out by mistake

   be very careful senor begged his
guide uneasily  ill take you safely
through upon my honor a short half-
hour will see us on the other side

  nor did he speak beside the mark for
five and twenty minutes later-five and
twenty years they seemed to the torn and
bedraggled climbers-the thick gloom
gave way to dim starlight and they
emerged within a well-like opening over
which waved ghost-like grass and
rustling leaves

  allardyce drew gonzalez back into
the earth again

   why is this entrance left un-
guarded he inquired menacingly
clipping the tigers claws



   it is his excellencys private exit
only known to him-and me the spy
replied  by opening the water-gate
above it can be blocked

   why is the gate closed  

  to fill the dam up for the garri-
son

	they waited there till word came up
the line that the last man was within
touch then corbyn crept ahead to see
and make sure that their course was
clear

   theres no one within sight or hear-
ing said gonzalez  were well with-
in the ridge and all the troops are kept
in close quarters there lest they should
spoil or destroy his excellencys crops
see theres senor corbvn signaling to
you

  up above in the open air no time
was wasted

  gonzalez pointed out the black bulk
of the strange table-land on which
ybarras refuge stood and they held
straight for it in single file behind him
their backs toward the twinkling points
of fire which told them that breakfast
was being made ready for the regalement
of the regiments set there to withstand
them

  he did not lead them to the stair-
foot where there was also a fire burning
and a sleepy sentry ready to discourage
visitors but skirting the other side of
the plateau reached a long range of
cattle-sheds and byres

   be very cautious he requested
breathlessly  the peons quarters lie
beyond these buildings and there may be
dogs about

  even as he spoke one growled suspi-
ciously and a dozen others at once an-
swered it

   run  said gonzalez and they ran
in time and no more to escape the pack
which came hotfoot upon their trail as
they shut to the door of the long stable
they had entered

  they clambered to the loft above and
from there through an ivy-covered trap-
door into a crevice of the overhanging
cliff

  at the far end there was a second door
for which gonzalez had a key and once
within it he assured them that there
would be no pursuit

   only his excellency comes and goes

by this and the water-gate he said
 the stair on which we stand leads to
his private chapel

chapter xi

the disappearance of dom agustin
    and others results in an ap-
    pointment for von rudolf

   i wish you wouldnt press so hard
upon your pistol said ygnacio ybarra
 it hurts my head

   youll have  head immediately
armytage answered and his trigger-
finger trembled as he heard a rustle at
his side

   unless he added doubtfully
 you are prepared to carry out the or-
ders i shall give you

   spare him-for my sake tony
cried a womans voice and beatriz ybar-
ra would have laid a timid hand upon
his arm but that he ordered her back
abruptly

   stand still  he said again in span-
ish  or i fire

   let no one move ybarra echoed
 until i give the word

  then their eyes met again and he
continued tell me what you would
have me do and i-ill do it

  armytage tried hard not to look re-
lieved he had not dared to hope that
he could thus coerce his rival who
among many evil qualities had never
been accounted a coward ybarras reck-
less disregard of death his stubborn
courage had helped him to the place
he held and enabled him to sit secure
where a more cautious man would most
assuredly have come to grief

  his smooth assent to that which was
thus required of him without demur or
counter-stipulation made things much
easier for the englishman

   order your men to ground their
arms that strategist requested and the
president complied

  his words were audible throughout
the edifice the rank and file laid down
their rifles the staring subaltern in
charge cast sword and pistol clattering
on the tessellated pavement he felt the
degradation of this strange surrender
keenly but for ybarras sake he yielded
 say friend cornelius kerrigan


the all-story magazine

broke in  im on your side ill help
you if youll let me have a gun

   who is that man armytage asked
of beatriz

    yes hes a friend liell help she
replied  ill take a rifle also tony

   come up the steps then both of
you he said and they came forward
armed their reinforcement carried
matters more swiftly forward ami when
fifi also volunteered the congregation
was quite cowed by the three rifles
leveled at them while in the background
was his excellency helpless in the hands
of a mysterious stranger his very life
dependent on their prompt obedience

   have the church cleared com-
manded armytage  the women first
and then the workmen the troops will
follow with the lieutenant last

    they are to leave the hacicnda by
the stairway i have men posted there
and any one who speaks ere he or she
sets foot upon the road below will be
shot down without a moments mercy
the first shot fired will also sound your
death-knell bid them be very careful
to obey exactly

   an angry light shone in ybarras eyes
even as lie confirmed this disposition
he could not imagine by what means
armytage had succeeded in obtaining
entrance for the men of whom that anx-
ious diplomat had spoken so glibly he
could not know that there were only two
or that these in the uniform of his own
army had replaced the topmost sentries
by the expedient of a flask of potent
spirit duly drugged for the first time
he began to doubt the durability of his
luck if his opponent held the stairway
his own position would be doubly diffi-
cult

   there was no present help for it how-
ever and he heard his wonder-dumb de-
pendents and his guards shuffle away in
silcnce they streamed up the long
passage to its exit out into the darkness
down the stair past the two troopers sta-
tioned there without a whisper

   and when the keepers of the stair-foot
would have questioned them the women
broke and ran with white lips for the
safe shelter of the huts behind the
stables their men-folk followed sheep-
ishly and after them the soldiery came
forth in impotent array

  the last to reach ground-level was
the boy-officer who had been chosen to
command the guard of honor his black
eyes were suffused with tears of shame
his empty fingers twitched convulsively
his cheeks were chalk-like in their pallor

  he formed his men up and marched
off to camp there to inform von rudolf
of that which had befallen

  ybarra was by this time bitterly re-
pentant for that he had not bidden the
general himself to attend the ceremony
but he had been so secure in the inac-
cessibility of his private stronghold that
he had thought it more prudent to in-
sure the safeguarding of the outer gate

  furthermore the said von rudolf had
to perfection that most debonair and
winning way with women which don
ygnacio was ever striving to attain but
with equivocal success it had not
seemed advisable to his excellency to
challenge comparison of himself with
the beau sabrcur in all the glory of full
regimentals and it had seemed still less
so to expose that most susceptible young
man to further contact with the dona
beatriz

  he was still cursing his precautions
for the general good when armytage
stepped back and bade him stand up-
right

  he did so gladly the two rivals
faced each other for the first time since
they had dropped their masks at one
side stood the girl for whom they were
prepared to fight to a finish fifi and
kerrigan looked on the latter with his
rifle ready for eventualities

  armytage asked his name and learn-
ing it knew who he was corbyn had
spoken of him

   you know this place better than i
mr kerrigan he said pleasantly if
you will reinforce my men above-ground

i	shall be easier in my mind the stair-
head must be held at any cost and if
theres any other entrance to the
hacicnda it will be well to guard that
also it wont be long before we have
von rudolf to reckon with

  cornelius sought a sign from beatriz
and she nodded he went away to car-
ry out the duty imposed on him and
when he found that all the company he
could count upon for the defense con-
sisted of two devil-may-care cavalry
clipping the tigers claws



troopers with a west point vocabulary
he barely escaped brain-fever but he
soon assimilated some of their ideas as
to the wisdom of evading worry until
that specter should assume a tangible
and concrete shape and so sat down
to help them hold the fort there since
he knew no other vulnerable point

  while down below them the dum-
founded guardians of the stair-foot
squatted about their fire and spoke in
whispers of the incomprehensible move-
ments they had witnessed

   youre foolish armytage ybarra
said  to come here thus you have me
at a disadvantage for the moment but
you can scarcely hope to escape with
your prize can we not settle matters
amicably im willing to make terms

  beatriz was about to speak but
checked the impulse armytage was
looking fixedly at her half-cousin whose
eyes soon fell before the englishmans
straightforward glance

   you take me for a fool ybarra he
answered presently  and perhaps youre
right id rather be an honest fool than
a clever rogue but if you think im
fool enough to take your word for any-
thing youve overshot the mark par-
don my speaking plainly but it will be
best to understand each other

   no terms that you could offer would
tempt me to trust you your reputation
is not that of a fool and still less that
of an honest man

  the presidents pale face grew paler
and his teeth clenched under the unvar-
nished rejection of his right to treat in
honor with an enemy

  it was so long since any one had dared
to twit him with his weaknesses that he
had grown to think himself no worse in
thatrespect than any of his neighbors
lpon his pedestal of autocracy he had
been immune from criticism its per-
sonal application now stung him to the
verge of violent outbreak

  but with an effort he controlled his
feelings

   you have me at a disadvantage he
repeated  for the moment what do
you mean to do 

   i have accomplished my immediate
object armytage responded  which
was to prevent your molesting the lady
who will shortlv be mv wife i dont

know that i need discuss with you my
further plans

   it would perhaps be waste of time
it they have any reference to the dona
beatrix ybarra countered and his
cousin at length broke silence

   tony she said in a tense whisper
and her lover held out his right hand

  she moved toward him and he caught
her in a close embrace which somewhat
salved the hurt that his first words to
her had left all the time he kept his
left arm free and both eyes fixed upon
his excellency who was inwardly cursing
his astuteness

   tony she said again and shyly
nestling against his shoulder  there is
a priest here why should we not-

   we will sweetheart he answered
rapturously  and right away it was to
that end that i ventured to detain his
reverence

   come forward holy father there
will be a ceremony after all

  dom a gust  obeyed with terror-
stricken readiness penned in beyond
the altar he had been prevented from
escaping with the parislyoners and had
waited dumbly while the two men talked

  well need another witness army-
tage observed to the now blushing
beatriz  miss-miss florian might
perhaps ask mr kerrigan to step
down id go myself but it would not
be wise

   ill go said fifi bravely and
passed swiftly down the aisle the
echo of her footsteps became fainter and
then ceased

  ybarra  moved an inch or two to one
side

   stand still his adversary- ordered
and the words clicked like the snapping
of a steel trap he stood still since he
could see the blue-nosed bullets in the
revolver-barrel his teeth showed bare
behind the black mustache and his whole
attitude was that of a beast about to
spring armytage held him at bay with
unwinking watchfulness

  there was a sudden flash and beatriz
uttered a single strangled cry as she saw
armytage sink to the floor without a
sound so instantaneous had been the
impact of the great golden candlestick
which the priest had used as missile that
no shot was fired the stricken man
the all-story magazine

relaxed his trigger-fnger with he others
and lay starkly still

  ybarra sprang at her and heid her
lips his chaplain helping him to silence
her voices resounded from the stair-
way fifi and kerrigan were coming
down together the two men lifted her
and disappeared

  she was aware of an unpleasant
earthy odor and that they were descend-
ing almost immediately they stopped
and set her on her feet

  and one said sneeringly  your par-
don cousin if we have seemed rough or
hasty

  she did not answer knowing that
nothing she could say would help her
plight

  the place in which they were stand-
ing was pitch dark but she assumed that
it must be a crypt connected with the
chapel

  ybarra spoke again quite confidently
confirming her impression that it would
serve no purpose to cry out for help

   dom agustin will lead the way he
ordered  come beatriz tread care-
fully the steps are slippery-in places

  he led her forward and she followed
his directions dumbly they entered an
abruptly sloping tunnel and began a
journey which seemed never-ending

  their progress was slow  twice ybarra
urged the priest ahead to greater speed
but as he was about to speak a third
time there resounded from in front a
bitter and blood-curdling cry-a long-
drawn wail that rose full-voiced with-
out a moments warning and thinned
away into illimitable distance like the
last echo of a lost souls farewell even
ybarra shivered

  the girl beside him stopped and thrust
her fingers into her ears  her knees were
trembling under her she would have
fallen but that he upheld her and spoke
soothingly

   be brave he said  we are quite
safe

   what-what was that  she asked
a shrinking horror of him in her tone

   it must have been  it was
   never mind he stammered

	we are quite safe

   it was the priest she whispered
brokenly  and-and-you knew that
he was going to his death

   i thought he jtnew the secret said
ybarra sullenly  i would have warned
him but  it was an oversight-
an accident i was not thinking-i am
not to blame we must get on-away
from here come close your eyes if
you feel giddy you need not fear while
i am with you

  he struck a light and looked about
him his face was wet and ghastly

  a few steps farther down there was a
cresset in the tunnel wall and over
against it in a niche a plentiful supply
of pine-knots he paused to kindle a
handful in the iron basket and the light
from them lasted until he had led his
unresisting companion across the chasm
into which their ill-fated predecessor
had fallen

   it was a twelve-foot fissure within the
very heart of the titanic altar upon
which the hacienda stood a crack which
came together overhead and at some dis-
tance on either side of the tunnel below
it seemed to open out in bottle shape

   beatriz looking unblinkingly into its
abysmal depths as don ygnacio guided
her to safety on the other side saw for
herself the secret of which he had
spoken

  the narrow stairway led directly to
its edge and began again upon the other
side an infernal ingenuity had fash-
ioned the steps on both sides in such wise
that a stranger either mounting or de-
scending in the dark must surely slip
and so slide smoothly into space

  for those who knew there was a nar-
row gallery a two-foot ledge cut for a
mans height in the rock around the
edge skirting one corner of the open
mouth

  ybarra breathed more freely after
they had set another hundred steps be-
tween them and the gaping oubliette

  i hate this passage he said sav-
agely  ive always hated it thank
god were nearly through

   his spirits rose again however as soon
as they had clambered unobserved from
the ivy-covered cliff-face behind the
farm buildings on which the entrance
abutted thence they went forward to
von rudolfs camp and by the way
ybarra chatted volubly

   dom agustin is dead he said re-
flectively  and mores the pity but
clipping the tigers claws



the monks who made my private passage
-the golden horseshoe was a mission
when the spaniards ruled here-must
shoulder the responsibility

    there is no other priest at hand and
 i must wait a day or two before i nomi-
 nate a new chaplain he was a faithful
 fellow beatriz and always wide awake
 he caught my idea about the candle-
 stick at once-a telepathic sympathy no
 doubt

   she bore with him because she must
 but speechlessly and was unspeakably
 relieved when the sharp challenge of a
 sentry interrupted his reminiscences lor
 then he took upon himself again the dig-
 nitv of his high office and his habitual
 reserve

  von rudolf galloped out to greet
them when he heard of their miraculous
appearance at  the picket and having
satisfied himself that it was really they
made hasty disposition for their accom-
modation in camp and walked at his
excellencys side discussing all the as-
pects of the case and planning prompt
reprisals

   they sauntered slowly through the
 lines that their men might reassure
 themselves as to the presidents capacity
 for further mischief the story that the
 guard of honor had brought back had
 not improved his prestige-and see be-
 side him dona beatriz the beautiful and
 the wealthy upon whose whim it had
 been rumored depended all the back pay
 due them

   von rudolfs field-pavilion had been
 swept and garnished for his excellencys
 cousin she pleaded fatigue and passed
 within leaving the others to their own
 devices

   once inside secure from observation
 or intrusion she threw herself despair-
 ingly on the thick rugs with which the
 floor was covered her head fell for-
 ward on her forearm two tears of mis-
 ery ran down her wrists and then she
 slept the deep and dreamless slumber of
 exhaustion

  when she awoke refreshed and
strengthened it seemed strange to her
that day had not yet broken the inner
chamber where she lay was dark but
in the anteroom beyond a lamp was
still burning and seated in a rocking-
chair was fifi florian busily sewing

  she lay still for a moment struggling
to recollect somewhat bewildered be-
tween the curtains she observed fifi rise
as a step came softly toward the canvas
porchway which was also discreetly
draped

  some one lapped gently and a hand
was thrust through with a note fifi
eyes downcast squeezed the one and
took the other then she turned back and
read the note scribbled a hasty answer
 the reverse side entrusted that to the
five fingers visible behind the screen
gave vent to a coy giggle as they made a
grab at her and fled back to her rocking-
chair with much modest confusion and
a mincing gait

  the hand was withdrawn and steps
died quietly away

   damn that fellow anyway  com-
mented the occupant of the rocking-
chai facing about with guilty haste as
beartviz came through laying finger on
lips with an imploring gesture

   im one of armvtages men he ex-
plained  my name is allardyce

    	chapter xii

the man behind the tgerskin takes
    part in a tricky turn  and fifi
    florian takes a friends place

  beatriz looked at him with an ex-
pression of the most blank amazement

   kerrigan made me up he contin-
ued as if anxious to dispel her doubts at
once  he would have come himself
but i am more like fifi

  she held a hand up and he paused

   i dont-i cant-where have you
come from she asked dully how
long have i been here

  he looked at her in turn and what
he saw in her clear eyes helped him to
understand

   you have been here for nearly four
and twenty hours he answered speak-
ing distinctly  and much lias happened
in that time i think you must have had
some opiate to make you sleep so long

   in the first place the majors none
the worse for the priests blow which
onlv stunned him he has commissioned
me to take you to the hacicnda i
reached his side with the remainder of
his force some hours ago and came on


the all-story magazine

here as soon as corney-kerrigan this
is-had fixed me up to look like fifi

   the pickets passed me readily
enough and  went straight to von
rudolf with a note from armytage say-
ing that you would he sure to want your
maid he brought me here and has been
corresponding with me ever since i
told him in reply to his last billet doux
that you were angry with him for
disturbing you and that he must stay
away until i want him

   his excellency is at present on his
way here from cruz alta where he went
yesterday to slaughter quintin sariol
who he thinks is plotting to supplant
him he intends to bring a priest back
with him

   the coast is therefore as clear as it
will ever be and if you feel all right
again wed better go as soon as
possible

   yes i am wide awake now she
declared   think they must have
drugged the glass of water that i drank
just before daylight it seems so short
a time since i saw dawn across the
threshold what chance is there of our
escaping from the camp  

   where is the glass you drank from 
fifis double asked and she fetched it
along with a glass carafe still half full

  allardyce held it up to the light then
shook it slowly its contents clouded
over and he chuckled

   theyre third-class criminals and
clumsy ones at that he commented
cheerfully  do you know mr chal-
loner miss beatriz

  she shook her head and seemed sur-
prised

   thats all right then said he
 and now if you will-if you will
change your costume for that which i
have brought you in this suit-case ill
have you safely settled at the hacienda
with the real fifi by the time his
excellency comes to pay his morning
call upon you but you must not delay
a moment in the process please if he
should catch us by the way-

  she caught up the case and had dis-
appeared ere he could finish

  he turned away and lifted up a corner
of the tiger-skin which covered a dim
corner of the anteroom behind the chair
in which she had been sitting

   the games  afoot old chap he
whispered  if any trouble comes to
you through the part you have played
send up the signal and ill come to your
assistance

   the wireless will be wild if they
hear how ive been behaving he
answered challoner with a wry grin
 as for ybarra i dont give a damn
he doesnt dare interfere with me ive
too much pull crank up and get her
going

  the englishman dropped the rug
over him again turned the lamp lower
and passed swiftly to the porch he
thrust a hand out through the curtains
there and waved it in a manner which
he hoped might be set down as ladylike
and languid soft footsteps once more
sounded on the sun-baked soil without
and some one stooping kissed his
fingers

  he shook with silent laughter but
composed his features as von rudolf
pulled the screens apart and peeped in
roguishly

   angel adorable  whispered that
flatterer in french

  but his charmer with shy gestures
indicated the necessity of caution so in
pantomime he promised everything she
asked and as she drew back before him
crossed the threshold on tiptoe

  she raised her eyebrows and held up
her hands with a wild glance toward
the inner room always retreating
when he was opposite the rocking-chair
she signed to him to sit down while she
assured herself that there was no one
watching

  he did so willingly and waited with
a complacent smile while she tripped to
the partition laid an ear against it
listened for the fraction of a second and
came back behind him

  flash-like von rudolfs long legs
were shot out in front of him the rock-
ing-chair tipped backward and a cravat
of cord across his throat cut short the
cry of anger and astonishment to which
he would have given voice

  allardyce choked him thoroughly and
there emerged from underneath a tiger-
skin one who unseen secured his ankles
first and afterward his wrists it was
a very workmanlike garroting

  a scarf shut sight of the canvas ceiling
clipping the ilglrs claws

frum ii string eyes he choked and
mi all  wed a the contents of a corah
 b-l--d into his open mouth to gag
him efficaciously was easy and after that
he was quite powerless sight speech
and hearing were shut off and the
languor of drugged impotence was
loosening hi limbs

  the englishman made all his disposi-
tions at tip speed then turned his atten-
tion io providing challoner with an alibi
which should be unimpeachable he
tied him also hand and foot but tenderly
tacked him a-ay beneath the rug again
patted his curly head approvingly and
held up a handkerchief

   read- old chap he asked

  the correspondent nodded

    that was a tricky turn  he said
 give armytage my love and dont
forget to tell him that im working for
the wireless  dont mind lending him
a helping hand at an odd moment now
and then

    ill tel him youre a wooden brick
responded allardyce in a gruff voice
 what hope would  have had of get-
ting his girl back to him if you hadnt
stepped up

   nuff said snapped challoner
 get busy with the rrouchrir or ill
bite yon

  he signified as soon as he was gagged
and blinded that he could live quite
comfortably till relief came allardyce
gave him a very gentle farewell pat and
pulled the rug up carefully

  there was another young man waiting
when he rose a shapely youth with
motor garb-and goggles hrt coat and
cap and puttee all complete but who
w blushing vividly

  she started at the sight of von ru-
dolfs figure covered with a table-cloth
and stood aghast when allardyce faced
her in the generals field-uniform

    its i all right he said to reasrare
her  do i look like him 

   i thought it was he and that you
she answered staring at the outline in
the chair

   youre challoner a correspondent
of the wireless come through cruz
alta fromhe ast in starch of news
he explained rapidlv your motor-
bikes behind von rudolfs tent

  yon rudolfs going rund the

pickets now and youll go with him
w hen we get to the outermost well have
to make a break for the stair-foot which
armytages men hold now if anv-
thing goes wrong youll run for it wboe
i keep any friends that follow us in
check whatever happens you make for
the hacienda ready

   quite ready

   off we go then and-good luck
to us

  he extinguished the lamp and thev
started

  their way led through the officers
lines and from the bell-tents the s und
of snoring smote upon the small hours
beyond these were the servants
bivouacs rude shelters screens of
platted grass and then the kitchens
where a night-cook boiling water for
the duty detail sprang to attention as
the- passed and startled beatriz so that
she all but screamed von rudolf had
apparently succeeded in imbuing his
subordinates with a profound respect for
austrian etiquette

  allardyce lifted a forefinger in per-
functory response and looking back from
a safe distance saw that the man had
squatted down beside his fire again

   i think that well pass current he
encouraged her

  they followed the made road which
ran straight from the ridge to the stair-
foot and twice met orderlies bringing
reports in from the pickets allardyce
opened these and read them striking
matches in the shelter of his great-coat
his chin well down within the collar

  the first of them be sent or into
ramp the second was instructed to re-
turn whence he had come and bid the
n n-rommissic ned officer in charge await
the generals arrival

  allardyce lit a cigarette and taking
his companion by the arm strode for-
ward chatting cheerfully in french of
the most nondescript  as they ap-
proached the outpost set half way be-
tween the hacienda and the ridge he
stopped to illustrate a point of no im-
portance puffing smoke the while

  thev turned the guard out in his
hon--r despite his indiffer-n protest he
locked it over quickly and passed on
t nlv a last outlying pi ket lay between


the all-story magazine

  they had all but won through when
from behind sounded the call to arms
a single rocket soared up and dropped
two blue stars they heard the sound of
feet running after them and in front had
to face seven rifles waiting the word to
ire

  allardyce gnashed his teeth and swore
vociferously at the pickets corporal who
presently came forward and was most
apologetic when he saw the general but
would by no means part with him

  it isby your own order general
he said appealingly  and you will
doubtless have me shot like those poor
fellows who let senor sariol through if

i	do not obey the very letter of it there
were two stars and that means  hold all
comers whatsoever it is by your own
order general my god do not push
past me or ill fire 

   now run  cried allardyce in such
a tone that his companion did not dare
to disobey at that instant his left hand
shot forth the corporal fell over back-
ward with a final grunt while the mere
rank and file too bewildered by such a
strange display upon the part of their
redoubtable chief to offer further resist-
ance were glad to see him disappear
into the darkness ahead as soon as
he was out of sight they judged it well
to open an aimless fire upon the sur-
rounding scenery

  two or three bullets whistled past the
fugitives but they paid no attention to
such trifles what frightened allardyce
far more was the faint thud of hoofs be-
hind his hack that did not die down
but gained in volume until he ktiew that
the pursuers must be dangerously nlar

   keep straight on he told beatriz
abruptly and stopped short himself

  she knew that it would only hamper
him if she should lag and went on most
unwillingly but with renewed energy
if she were out of the way there would
be more chance for him she heard the
crack of his revolver and loud cries

  a moment later she fell headlong into
the arms of a gray shadow traveling
outward at a great pace and with others
following behind

  whos this it asked most anxious-
ly she replied tony hes back
there oh quick-or you will be too
late

  tie was too late and that though he
lost no single instant there was a hot
skirmish in the dark between his bandful
and the hurried reinforcements which
had made the pickets position impreg-
nable to him but for the darkness he
would have been cut off from his own
base and even as it was he had to fight
hard to regain the stair-foot

  there he found safety in the end but
as he carried up the steep stone steps the
slim boy whose recovery had cost the
capture of another his gray eyes were
dim and he held beatriz very tightly
to him for she was doubly dear since
she had cost so much

  fifi svas waiting at the top and led
beatriz in to the house kerrigan and
corbyn spent the remainder of the night
in proving to each other and to army-
tage that when fate steps in human effort
is of no avail

   its just the narrowness that
pinches corbyn concluded as day
broke  less than a hundred yards we
lost him by i reckon i wish that he
had let me go instead

  a clear cold dawn showed that the
plain beneath was empty save for the
customary outposts the scant light
strengthened and the sun changed the
gray walls of their prison to gold
spirals of smoke rose slowly from the
ridge and the world about them woke
without discord it seemed that they
were not to be molested yet awhile and
since the hour for a daylight attack was
safely past they tried to sleep

  then beatriz came forth in her own
guise and paced the garden paths with
armytage till fifi came to call them to
breakfast both girls were heavy-eyed
but strove to show a brave front to the
others it was a melancholy morning

  they fumed and fretted all forenoon
in forced inaction it would have been
sheer madness to attempt a sortie and yet
every man among them itched to pro-
pose and to take part in it rut coramon-
sense prevailed and no one annoyed his
neighbors by suggesting an impossibility
their business was to get the women
safely to the coast and at all costs they
must attend to that

  a sudden idea struck kerrigan and he
communicated it to armytage whs
jumped at it with concentrated eagerness
clipping the tigers claws



   where did you say they signaled
from he asked the south side
come along well find the tackle if
its anywhere about the hacienda

  xor had they far to look for under
a loose plank in the porch they dis-
covered all the signaling equipment
used for communicating with cruz alta
when his excellency happened to be in
the golden horseshoe

  armytage carried the tripod out and
kerrigan the leather case containing the
two mirrors they set the apparatus up
sighted it on the main-guard at the
ridge and the major to whom all such
matters were as an open book sent an
insistent call across to the enemy

  within ten minutes there came back
an answering flash and he held speech
with don ygnacio

  his first inquiry was as to allardyce
allardyce was alive

  he asked if don ygnacio would ex-
change him honorably for gonzalez but
was informed that he might hang that
individual out of hand and so save don
ygnacio trouble it seemed that don
ygnacio was not at all pleased with his
ex-spy

    and-as to-the-senor-allar-
dyce armytage read mechanically
turning the text of the flickering message
into english for behoof of his listening
men  he will be shot-at-dawn-to-
morrow the rest-of-you-will be
t reated-likewise - when-the-t ime -
comes 

   we need waste no more words on
him said the major curtly  ill see
whether i cant call up cruz alta
vice-president sariol might do something
for us

  but ere he could achieve his purpose
it had been forestalled a message from
the ridge forbidding the city to answer
any signals but those preceded by the
presidents cipher all he could do was
to read off the news that came thence to
the camp and since the bulk of that was
also coded he learned little

  corbyn and kerrigan in turn took
their commander to one side in order to
propound to him a private plan whereby
each might take allardyces place or
failing that lead a forlorn hope to his
rescue it was of course impossible
for armytage to countenance such a

suggestion or he would have gone forth
himself

  fortune had called a forfeit fixing on
allardyce to pay it that he would do
so withgood grace affd manliness no one
doubted the irrevocable could not be
gainsaid no matter what it might cost to
look on

  next morning they could not help but
rise early so sleepless had the night been
standing upon the cliffs they once more
watclied the dawn and heard the minutes
tick away

  the doomed mans friends saw clearly
through their glasses all that passed
there was a band which played a dismal
parody of the dead march and close
behind it a rough coffin on a cart after
the cart there walked a woman closely
guarded

  armytage groaned aloud

   poor chap  he said  theyve
made him wear the clothes he was
disguised in what an inhuman brute
ybarra is 

  the sad procession halted half way
between the two opposing camps and
waited there until all the troops visible
had massed upon it they formed a
hollow square on one side of which a
dozen sappers had dug a narrow shallow
grave

  the woman stepped toward it without
hesitation and stood facing the firing
party while an officer acting as provost-
marshal declaimed in a loud voice her
crime and its sentence faint echoes of
his speech floated to the hacienda on the
rare atmosphere

  and while the men there strained their
ears in a vain effort to catch a chance
word they heard a cheery voice behind
them saying

   gad but im glad to see you all
again

  it was allardyce himself who shook
hands with therh after they had got over
their first fright

 whats doing down there he
asked wonderingly

  as he spoke a thin white straggling
vapor wreathed the rifles of the firing-
party the woman in front of them fell
forward on her face and lay there very
still a sudden discordant crackle
sounded jarringly upon the silence

  and at that moment beatriz  barra

 ginger handasydes home-coming

by robert ai i ken

  a long-absent lover whose
  second return dispelled the
  grief his first had brought j-

  t was very hot in sao pedro

      the fat ship-chandlers clerk am-
bling along the shady side of the
calle desierta paused for a moment
to mop his moist countenance with an un-
pleasant-looking pocket-handkerchief in
order that he might do so the more con-
veniently he dropped upon the dusty
pavement the tiny octagonal tin case
labeled for the mail which he was car-
rying toward the lifeless post-office at
the end of the street and leaned his
great white green-lined umbrella
against his shoulder

  the laths in the outlook of a sun-
shutter behind him moved creakingly a
pair of hot feverish eyes peering out in
vain quest of coolness or change rested
fretfully for a moment on the blinding
brightness of the discarded package and
were instantly withdrawn the way-
farer glancing mechanically upward
saw only the impenetrable screen

  a pariah dog paused perfunctorily to
nose the glittering jetsam and he kicked
it in the ribs it snapped at his ankles
and fled in haste with a mouthful of
trouser-leg

  the fat man swore sanguinarily in
seven languages and disregarding in his
wrath the adverse climatic conditions
sought with exceeding fervor some
scheme of retaliation the dog lay
down in the dry gutter at a distance
with a view to making a meal of its
mouthful

  the prayerful eye of the avenger

lighted upon the twinkling tin he
picked it up again thankfully sidled
down the street in the shadow of the
houses and casting his missile with teu-
tonic accuracy smote the enemy to its
hurt wherefore he recovered the case
and pursued his way peacefully under a
halo of perspiration pocketing with ten-
der solicitude the half-chewed shred of
cloth which the cur had dropped

  the incident thus ended paul me-
thuen who had witnessed it with lan-
guid amusement lay back in his chair
again with a groan of disgust

  he might have been a passenger by the
same steamer which would take the par-
cel away from sao pedro but for a
bout of fever which coupled with gin-
ger iiandasydes unaccountable failure
to turn up in time had caused him to de-
lay his departure for another week it
made him tired to think of such misfor-
tune and-in five minutes he was fast
asleep

  sleep is scarce and precious during the
long days and nights when the norte
blows across brazil like the breath of a
blast-furnace i-t is worth more to an
invalid than many doctors and when a
grating guttural voice recalled methuen
the recently recovered from the
snow-sweet realm of dreams to a hate-
ful sweltering consciousness of mundane
misery that irritable convalescent rose
limply from his lounge resolute to shed
the blood of the injurious soliloquist

  it was the ship-chandlers clerkvwho
addressing to the still apparent mongrel
noisy judas-like endearments would
fain have decoyed it within reach of his
resentment he was still carrying the
curious case had evidently missed the
mail and held it morally responsible for
the mischance
ginger handasydes ii ime-coming



   methuen lacking personal interest fh
grievances other than his own opened
fire upon him with an overripe orange
the bullet found its billet on the nape
of the unconscious aliens neck

   that injured individual almost broke
down under the bespattering misfortune
which had thus befallen him but faced
about and entered into acrimonious ar-
gument in the midst of this he threw
the tin with great cunning and swiftness
at his aggressors head

   methuen caught it deftly weighed it
for a moment in one hand that he mighi
the more rakiiiglv return the compliment
and-fell fainting

   his projectile clattered over the win-
dow-sill onto the flags the fat man
once more retrieved it hastily and melt-
ed away in silence

   the dog barked delightedly and hav-
ing composed itself to slumber snored
audibly throughout the afternoon

   it was very hot in sao pedro

  up-river a hundred miles from the
seashore it was if anything hotter and
ah chow chopping wood in the pri-
meval forest sighed wearily

   his heart was not in his work  his
thoughts were wandering it therefore
happened quite suddenly that he
chopped a joint off his left forefinger

   his attention thus pointedly recalled
to the matter in hand he dropped his im-
plement and eyed the damaged digit
frowningly

    velly dam luck  said ah chow

   he tore a thread from the ragged shirt
which composed his costume and with
the helpof his teeth tied it tightly about
the wounded finger then he lit a small
fire heated the blade of his chopper
therein with great patience and cauter-
ized the bleeding stump unflinchingly

   as soon as the chopper was onre more
cool he went on deliberately with his
chopping

   toward sunset he rested from his la-
bors in that direction setting himself
instead to the tying up of neat little
bundles of fagots with cordage of flex-
ile creepers

when he had builded up a yellow
mans burden of these he shouldered it
uncomplainingly and made his way with
cautious steps toward an extremely in-


eligible abode pitched on foot-high piles
above the sodden bank of a sluggish
stream which wandered through the
dankness of the undergrowth like a
wounded serpent wherein on a couch
of dry leaves lay ginger handasyde de-
lirious

  ginger was no coward but he had
fled from sao pedro to escape the epi-
demic which seemed likely to decimate
the scanty population of that insalubri-
ous spot

  he had been risking his life there for
five long years in order to accumulate a
competence and now that he had almost
achieved his object had not scrupled to
flee before the plague until such time
as he should be ready to set sail from its
stronghold for good and all

  that was already arranged he had
promised to accompany paul methuen
by the cotopaxi at the end of april by
which time the balance of his modest
fortune would be forthcoming in cash
with it in his hand he would go back
to civilization and match the march-
mont millions for a wife

  such was the proposal but the dis-
posal was otherwise for it fell out that
the fever followed him he was one of
the first to be stricken by it in the lit-
tle country village whither he had re-
treated

  help there was none the populace
was panic-stricken believing that he had
brought the pestilence within their walls
they pursued with him the time-worn
tactics of superstitious ignorance turn-
ing him out into the wilderness to die-
as live-as an all-wise providence should
ordain  and the chief of police officially
annexed his portmanteau which was a
new one and looked quite nice once his
initials had been inked over

  in deference to his obvious gentility
they exiled with him the surprised ah
chow professional vagrant and ordered
that unfortunate to see the matter
through under pain of their most pro-
nounced displeasure after which they
forgot all about both for the sickness
ceased

  ah chow having pondered the situa
tion deeply decided to carry out the trust
imposed upon him he had found it not
unprofitable in the course of his career
to deal justly by such of the human race
	the all-story magazine

as were of ruddy countenance with red
hair and blue eyes lie knew more-
over that he might well be shot at sight
by any black-browed local patriot who
should chance to find him wandering
from the narrow path of duty and in
view of all these inducements to well-
doing set himself philosophically to tend
his gratuitous charge whom he feeling-
ly described for his own private edifica-
tion as  velly sick pidgin

  he was by no means a bad servant
and he was also a fatalist he made his
patient as comfortable as might be un-
der the very uncomfortable circum-
stances keeping house for him on such
slender resources as were to be had for
the gathering within the great forest
which hemmed them in

  linger grew rapidly worse and ah
chow who had acquired an easy liking
for the helpless white man correspond-
ingly sorrowful sorrow and fatalism
with a blending of sanitary instinct in-
duced the faithful chinaman to cut much
fire-wood which he persisted in stor-
ing immediately underneath the rotten
floor of mr handasydes temporary
dwelling and mr handasydes cursory
objections to this dangerous habit he met
with diplomatic evasiveness

  ginger spoke rationally to him at in-
frequent intervals and ah chow always
answered civilly to the best of his ability
lightly undertaking many ill-understood
commissions of importance in order that
his master might sleep with an easier
mind until at the end of an interminable
week that sufferer did drop off

   he slept for twelve hours and ah chow
watching over him grew very weary
he slept for twelve more and the ce-
lestial decided that it was high time to
jog the memory of that particular joss
which had so evidently forgotten a worn-
out chinaman at his post

  he looked long and carefully at the
motionless figure on its leafy couch held
a steel mirror to the breathless lips in
vain stood upright dizzily and shook
his head with doleful significance

  he placed his last handful of rice
and a pinch of rock-salt upon the head
mans breast moistened thtj lips of the
corpse with water against the long jour-
ney groaned heartrendingly and ap-
plied a light to the carefully prepared

	pyre the dry fagots flamed up sobbed
inwardly and were all ablaze

  ah chow sat -down at a safe distance
and closed his tired eyes moralizing in
the confucian manner upon the muta-
bility of human purpose until an indig-
nant family of monkeys stopped his snor-
ing with a shower of nuts having
now overcome his mixed emotions he
returned to the site of the riverside
mansion which was now  more

  the most prized of the poor orien-
tals worldly possessions was a small oc-
tagonal tin of curious workmanship in-
wrought with quaint devices in the shape
of dragons and serpents enwrapped in
blue paper bearing the announcement

   ly chee

  this he sacrificed upon the altar of
friendship soaking it in the stream un-
til its gaudy wrapper was  more pol-
ishing it with the plenteous mud to an
exceeding brightness

  he took two double-handfuls of pro-
miscuous gray ash from the heap which
represented the deceased dropped them
decorously into the tin and having also
enclosed a calling-card inscribed with
certain shaky words entrusted to him by
ginger in an interval of sanity soldered
the lid back into its place with a brand
from the fresh fire that accomplished
he departed coastward circuitously satis-
fied that he had done his best for all

  arriving at sao pedro after manifold
and blood-curdling trials he sought out
samuelsen the ship-chandler from
whom it had been his habit in happier
days to purchase pennyworths of pre-
served ginger and laid before that unin-
terested individual an addressed envelope
containing a letter written by the de-
funct american as also the tin coir-
taining all that was left of the letter

  by some species of legerdemain he
produced from nowhere in particular
the sum of two milreis in small change
the harvest of a somewhat prolonged
plowing in the wilds of brazil and
having spread that out upon the counter
departed penniless to hire himself in
the capacity of cook to the skipper of a
swedish bark then lying in the roads
this later on had to be abandoned 
the high seas because of the contagion
which went on board with the china-
man
ginger hanpasydes home-coming

  he was no longer visible when mr
samuelsen again looked up from his
ledger and that gentleman was consid-
erably incensed by his casual conduct
but notwithstanding instructed his
clerk to forward the aforesaid letter and
parcel to the address indicated on the
envelope which the clerk finally did at
the inclusive cost of one and a half mil-
reis two trips to the post-office and a
vast amount of grumbling

  he and his employer were then taken
very sick and had to stay in bed for a
fortnight before they felt better neither
they nor the swedish skipper can speak
of ah chow without emotion to this
day

  in due course and after being disin-
fected by the quarantine officials the let-
ter reached its destination on long
island sound anfmay marchmont felt
uncommonly glad when she had read it
that she had had faith enough in the
future to refuse that morning for the
fifth time the unconditional offer of her
cousin tommys hand and heart

  five years is a long past to x mod-
ern maiden of three and twenty and
tommys annual appeal had served to
remind her however unnecessarily that
she had had no word from the other
in all that interval for ginger poor
proud and dipped in debt before his de-
parture had not dared to put his aspira-
tions into words ere he set forth for for-
eign parts in search of that fortune
which should enable him to make her a
similar and more acceptable offer

  wherefore perhaps he had main-
tained a higher rank in her esteem than
any of the other suitors who had come
and gone in his absence

  his written message was a formal one
but she could read between the lines
and what she saw there brought bright-
er color to her cheeks it would be her
turn now to call the main and-she
owed this mr handasyde some sleepless
nights

  should she take toll of him when he
appeared for the -quixotic stubbornness
which had kept them apart which might
easily have cost them both their
happiness or should she rather re-
ward at once the single-minded purpose
which had brought him back from the
struggle to sge for his prize she

  	-s

laughed delightedly and went indoors out
of the sunshine making her way toward
the drawing-room whence sounded the
voices of visitors

  there was evidently a man among
them and she thought it only kind to
round up tommy the disconsolate for
his more masculine entertainment that
youth she discovered in a very dejected
attitude and a capacious armchair be-
fore the fire in the billian -room he
made no objection to honoring his aunts
tea-table with his presence given that
there was another male on the spot to
support him against the opposite sex
and followed his cousin back to the
drawing-room obediently although with-
out enthusiasm

  a tall thin cadaverous-looking stran-
ger rose to intercept them as they came
forward and with a simultaneous start
they recognized paul methuen

  how d ye do miss marchmont
said that wanderer cheerfully and held
out his hand  how do tommy
howre things with you all brisk
eh

  they returned his greeting warmly
and having saluted the other guests re-
turned to talk paul had been a great
friend of theirs before he went abroad

   and  how are you   may asked
 you dont look very-

   strong as a horse he reassured her
heartily  and quite ready for a good
time i had a go of fever y know and
lost weight a bit but im all right now

  thus euphemistically did he describe
the very narrowest escape from death at
which the overworked danish doctor in
sao pedro had ever connived during a
long experience of that joyless spot

  	how did you leave gerald handa-
syde paul asked mrs marchmonts
gentle voice and her daughter listened
intently

   quite well last time i saw him
methuen answered  he went up-river
to get away from the fever its been
pretty bad this summer-or winter as
you call it here

 what sort of fever tommy in-
terpolated and the traveler turned to-
ward him again

  yellow jaqk he explained in a
lower tone  a nasty dirty sort of sick-
ness knocks a man out in quick-time-
r 



the all-story magazine

and then they cremate you in case you
recover

   ive heard of it said tommy
 whens ginger coming home

  mays heart sank as methuen frowned
and shook his head but she could feel
the edge of the envelope in her lap and
that helped to uphold her

  extraordinary thing he replied
 ginger and i agreed months ago to
travel by the same steamer but he didnt
turn up although i waited a week for
him and ive had  news of him since

   perhaps well hear by the next boat

  more people came in and there was
nothing else said on that subject tea
over a move was made toward the ten-
nis-courts and paul claimed may as his
partner for the first set on the plea of his
own rustiness but she did not seem to
be in the best of form either and they
were hard pushed by their opponents

  the appearance of the station-messen-
ger trundling up the avenue on his wheel
afforded them a pretext for a moments
breathing-space while she inspected the
mail

  paul methuen watching her admi-
ringly as she came tripping back across
the turf saw with sudden horror that
she was carrying poised on her racquet
what seemed a faithful duplicate of the
curious case which he and the ship-
chandlers clerk had used for projectile
in the calle desierta a few short weeks
before he felt a sudden dryness of the
mouth as she dropped it outside the
court and his play became so shocking
that the other side had no difficulty in
bringing the game to an early conclusion
whereupon he apologized lamely and
she went off laughing to welcome some
new arrivals so that the ill-omened arti-
cle lay where she had left it until tom-
my marchmont passing picked it up

   more cigarettes may he asked in
jest

   open it she answered  to dis-
prove the libel

  the case was tightly soldered how-
ever and the inquisitive youth had some
difficulty in broaching it with his knife
but he finally managed to cut round the
lid and forcing the jagged ends back
handed it to his cousin while half a
dozen of the loungers looked on with
idle curiosity

  she peered into it half fearfully and
inserting her hand drew forth a calling-
card soiled and smeared with fine gray
dust

  methuen watching the process with
a fascinated stare a sick anticipation of
evil sprang forward to save her but he
was too late the card fell fluttering
from her fingers as she pitched forward
on the grass unconscious

  ah chows tin treasure had been lying
in the handasyde burial-place for a full
week before may marchmont could re-
cover from the shock of its arrival and
then she went down-stairs again to face
things out since she had sold hei
hearts secret to the world she would
take the consequences without crying in
public

  she blushed hotly when paul me-
thuen met her in the hall-he had fallen
into the habit of riding over every day
to ask for her-but he kept his eyes else-
where and talked triflingly so that she
soon recovered her self-possession and
was even glad of his countenance as
they entered the crowded drawing-room
together in the midst of that ordeal
tommy came in and the two men car-
ried her off to a quiet corner where they
entrenched themselves one on each side
of her and under pretense of being des-
perately hungry occupied themselves
with eating and drinking

  paul was in the act of taking a large
bite out of a larger muffin when the
drawing-room door was opened from
without and a hysterical housemaid an-
nounced   mr gin-gerald handa-
syde

  a frozen silence fell upon the com-
pany as a gaunt-looking individual not
unlike the dead man save for the dam-
ning difference between his snow-white
hair and the flaming shock which had
been the hall-mark of the genuine gin-
ger advanced shamefacedly toward
them and no one answered his ingra-
tiating  good evenin

  he flushed and stopped short paul
methuen sprang up with a stifled ex-
clamation confronting him squarely
tommy reenforced his friend and the
two together shouldered the stranger
quietly but firmly out of the room

  may marchmont her face buried in
her hand

struggle to be still the others in pity
for her plight took up again their bro-
ken sentences and a low buzz of con-
versation once more filled the room

  outside in the hall three angry men
were eying each other unpleasantly un-
til at length the newcomer spoke for the
second time

   whats the matter with you all  
he demanded with great indignation
are you mad-or what

   damn it man methuen answered
as fiercely  youre dead dead an
buried-an cremated at that 

   im nothing of the sort you fool 
said the specter savagely  youre mad
at any rate and it turned to tommy

   well it inquired coldly as he
gaped vacantly in its direction  are
you tommy marchmont-or a paralytic
idiot  

   ginger old fellow  paul me-
thuen interrupted in a choking voice
 ginger old fellow is it really you 
is it really me the apparition
mocked without regard for grammar
if i didnt know you too well polly
methuen id try to knock some of the
silliness out of your fat head who d ye
think it is that you must bounce up and
boot me out of this room when i drop
into a friends house for a cup of tea

   youre ratty my lad thats whats
the matter with you take my tip and
swear off for a time till you get the
knots out of your noddle

  methuen gulped down his joy arid
unappalled by this utterance from the
tomb seized one hand of the wraith
which he shook like a pump-handle

   ginger old fellow  he repeated
ecstatically  ginger old fellow  
and did not for a moment leave off
his hand-shake

  tommy bolted back into the drawing-
room

   its him  he cried and at the
words his cousin ran past him into the
hall so that when the less impulsive of
the gathering followed her they were in
ample time to behold the edifying spec-
tacle of a beautiful heiress locked in the
arms of a haggard and by no means
lovely lover

  gerald handasyde was haled into the
drawing-room again and tljere held
forth for a time-concerninir the manner

of his most marvelous resurrection but
the billiard-room edition of his adven-
tures which was shorter and more to the
point must serve the purpose of these
pages wherein brevity is the soul of
worth

   i saw the dirty heathen popping his
beastly bundles under my bed said
ginger wrathfully while tommy held
a glass for him and methuen poured
but id no idea of the trick he in-
tended to play me

   i was feeling sort of cheap at the
time and thought a ten minutes snoozed
do me a lot of good but if youll
believe me id no sooner closed my eyes
than the worthy ah chow lighted me
up and cleared

   im pretty hardy but not quite
hardy enough to stop in bed when the
blankets are burning so i vamoosed the
ranch one-time nothing to wear but
an old top hat of the heathens that i
grabbed in passing all my money raked
in by the local aristocracy before they
footed me out into the forest an devil
a shave for weeks-i didnt need a
mirror to know that i was a beauty

   i strolled over toward the village to
investigate but some sportsman with a
second-hand rifle headed me off at the
outskirts which i took as a warning that
i need never hope to be a welcome guest
there

   i struck out for the coast-it took
me ten days to cover the distance-and
when i at last reached it my troubles be-
gan but i borrowed a pair of trousers
from a man i met-thats the mark of
his knife on my neck he didnt want
to oblige me-and swam out to an old
dago windjammer that was loading tim-
ber in a creek i came to

   the skipper shipped me as a dis-
tressed seaman and  worked my way to
new york got there last night and
wired you first thing this forenoon pol-
ly you brute youll find my message
when you get home i suppose

   aftd what about ah chow   asked
tommy thoughtlessly

  what about ah chow ginger
answered with great earnestness  well
i think ill have enough left out of the
wreck to burv him handsomely

   when i next meet ah chow he will
suddenly cease

and wrought despair

synopsis of previous chapters

colonel gajllard with his younger son radnor receives his nephew arnold
crosby the narrator at his southern place four-pools farm arnold learns that
the elder son jeff disinherited by his father has evidently gone to the bad out west and
that the negroes are terrified by a  hant that has appeared at four-pools that night
he sees a repulsive negro  cat-eye mose sneaking with a bundle to where the hant was
seen he tells his suspicions to his hosts who laugh at him

    radnor and jim mattison the sheriff are rivals for polly mathers at a dance at four-
pools radnor in a sheet plays the hant after some time he rejoins his guests strangely
excited polly snubs him that night arnold sees him sneak off mysteriously

   radnor and mose now have some secret ugly stories are circulated about radnor
and the hant some of which come to polly who becomes even colder

   mose secs the hant and is terrified arnold sees radnor again at night this time
he drives away with a mysterious some one hardly has he gone when mose rouses the
household by his fright at having seen another awful hant in the house

   next morning five thousand dollars in bonds and cash is missing from the safe
radnor though perturbed will not tell where he spent the night but vows he knows
nothing of the robbery ill feeling arises between himself and the colonel who engages
a detective he reports that radnor is guilty but crosby keeps this from the colonel
whose mental state is now of the worst and who breaks out and brutally beats a negro
suspected of chicken-stealing

   a trip is made to the luray cave polly mathers leaves her coat in the cave and the
colonel turns back for it radnor disappears to turn up again very much excited while
the colonel fails to appear and crosby in anxiety sets out again for luray where he
discovers the dead body of the missing man

   crosby suspects cat-eye mose the more so that he has disappeared and offers
a reward for his apprehension but the rest of the community believe radnor guilty
because of the quarrels that he and his father had had and because of the strangely
excited condition that the young man was in on the day of the murder radnor will do
little to help his cause being so reticent that crosby feels sure that he is shielding some
one and that the mysterious hant is somehow involved jim mattison is especially
vindictive against radnor much to the disgust and grief of polly who is much broken
up over the affair and shows that she is devoted to radnor crosby believing that the
culprit may be the scapegrace brother jeff telegraphs concerning him but gets the reply
that on the day of the murder jeff was at his home in the west the situation becomes
hopelessly involved and radnor at the inquest makes so poor a showing that he is sent
to jail then all of a sudden jerry patten an old friend of crosbys and an exceedingly
clever new york newspaper man sends word that he is coming down to solve the
mystery

feeling that he could find the bottom of
any mystery it was with a deep breath
of relief that i held out my hand

    hello old man how are you 
he exclaimed with a smile of cordiality
as he grasped it

   then recalling the gravity of the sit-
uation he with some difficulty pulled a
sober face

       jerry comes	

th e moment i caught sight of
     jerry as he swung off the train
     i felt involuntarily that my
     troubles were near their end

his sharp eager face with its firm
jaw and quick eye inspired one with the
i

j

the four-pools mystery



   im sorry that we meet again under
such sad circumstances he added per-
functorily  i suppose you think ive
meddled enough in your affairs already
and on my word i intended to stay out
of this

    but of course ive been watching it
in the papers partly because it was in-
teresting and partly because i knew you
it struck me yesterday afternoon as i
was thinking things over that you werent
making much headway and might like
a little help so i induced the post-
despatcli to send down their best man
i hope i shall get at the truth

  he paused a moment and looked at
me sharply

   do you want me to stay i will go
back if you say so

  i was instantly ashamed of my dis-
trust of the afternoon whatever might
be jerrys failings i could not doubt
as i looked into his face that his irish
heart was in the right place

    i am not afraid of the truth i re-
turned steadily if you can discover
it for heavens sake do so 

   well thats what im paid for
said jerry  the post-despatch doesnt
deal in fiction any more than it can
help its a terrible affair he added
briskly as we climbed into the carriage
 the details as i have them from the
papers are not full enough of course
but you can tell them to me as we drive
along

  i should have laughed had i been
feeling less anxious his greeting was
so entirely characteristic in the way he
shuffled through the necessary con-
dolences and jumped with such evident
relish to the gruesome details

  as i gathered up the reins and backed
away from the hitching-post jerry
broke out with	

   here hold on a minute where are
you going 

   back to four-pools i said in some
surprise  i thought youd want to un-
pack your things and get settled

    i havent much time to get settled
he laughed  i have an engagement in
new york the day after to-morrow
how about the cave is it too late to
visit it now  

    well i said dubiously  its eight
miles across the mountains and pretty

heavy roads it would be dark before
we got there

  as far as that goes we could visit
the cave at night as well as in the day-
time but i want to examine the neigh-
borhood and interview some of the
people so i suppose he added with an
impatient sigh  well have to wait till
morning and now wheres this young
gaillard 

   hes in the kennisburg jail

   and wheres that  

   about three miles from here and six
miles from the farm

   ah-suppose we pay him a visit first
then there are one or two points con-
cerning his whereabouts on the night
of the robbery and his actions on the
day csf the murder that i should like to
have him clear up

  i smiled slightly as i turned the
horses heads toward kennisburg rad-
nor in- his present uncommunicative
frame of mind was not likely to afford
jerry much satisfaction

   there isnt any time to waste said
jerry as we drove along  just let me
have your account of everything that
happened beginning with the first ap-
pearance of the ghost

   i briefly sketched the situation in four-
pools as i had found it on my arrival
and the events preceding the robbery and
the murder

  jerry interrupted me once or twice
with questions

  he was particularly interested in the
three-cornered situation concerning rad-
nor polly mathers and jim mattison
and i was as brief as possible in my re-
plies i did not care to make polly the
heroine of a sunday feature article he
was also persistent in regard to jeffer-
sons past

  i told him all i knew added the story
of my own suspicions and ended by pro-
ducing the telegram proving his alibi

   hm  said jerry folding it
thoughtfully and putting it in his pocket
 it had occurred to me too that jeff
might be our man-this puts an end to
the theory that he personally committed
the murder

   there are some very peculiar points
about this case he added  as a mat-
ter of fact i dont believe that radnor
gaillard is any more guilty of the crime


the all-story magazine

  than i am-or i shouldnt have come
  but it wont do for me to jump at con-
  clusions until i get more data  sup-
  pose you realize what is the peculiarly
  significant point about the murder
  you mean moses disappearance
   well no i didnt have that in
  mind thats significant enough to be
  sure but nothing but what you would
  naturally expect the crime was com-
  mitted if yoifr data is straight either by
  him or in his presence and of course he
  disappears you could scarcely have ex-
  pected to find him sitting there waiting
  for you in either case

     you mean radnors behavior on the
  day of the murder and his refusal to
  explain it i asked uneasily

   no jerry laughed that may
 be significant and it may not i strongly
 suspect that it is not what i mean is
 the peculiar place in which the crime
 was committed no person on earth
 could have foreseen that colonel gail-
 lard would go alone into that cave

     there is an accidental element about
  the murder it must have been commit-
  ted on the spur of the moment by some
  one who had not premeditated it-at
  least at that time this is the point
  we must keep in mind

    he sat for a few moments staring at
  the dashboard with a puzzled frown

     broadly speaking he said slowly
   i have found that you can place the
  motive of every wilful murder under
  one of three heads-avarice fear or
  revenge suppose we consider the first
  could avarice have been the motive for
  colonel gaillards murder the body
  had not been robbed you tell me

     no we found a gold watch and con-
  siderable money in the pockets

     then you see if the motive were
  avarice it could not have been immediate
  gain that throws out the possibility
  that the murderer was some unknown
  thief who merely took advantage of a
  chance opportunity if we are to con-
  ceive of avarice as the motive the crime
  must have been committed by some per-
  son who would benefit more remotely by
  the colonels death did any one owe

	him money that you know of

     there is no record of anything of
  the sort and he was a careful business
  man i do not think he would have

loaned money without making some mem-
orandum of it he held several mort-
gages but they of course revert to his
heire

   i understood that radnor was the
only heir

   he is practically there are a few
minor bequests to the servants and to
some old friends

   did the servants know that anything
was to go to them  

   no i dont think they did

   and this cat-eye mose did he re-
ceive a share 

 yes larger than any of the others
 it seems that colonel gail lard at
least had confidence in him and how
about the other son did he know that
he was to be disinherited  

   i think that the colonel made it plain
at the time they parted

  jerry shook his head and frowned

   this disinheriting business is bad i
dont like it and i never shall it stirs
up more ill feeling than anything i know
of jeff seems to have proved an alibi
however and we will dismiss him for the
present

   rad has always sympathized with
jeff i said

   then continued jerry  if the
servants did not know the contents of the
will and we have all of the data rad-
nor is the only one who could knowingly
have benefited by the colonels death

   suppose we take a glance at motives
of fear do you know of any one who
had any reason to stand in fear of the
colonel he wasnt oppressing anybody
no damaging evidence against any per-
son in his possession not levying black-
mail was he

   not that i know of and i smile
slightly

   its not likely mused jerry  but
you never can tell what is going to come
out when a respectable man is dead

   and now as to revenge with a
man of colonel gaillards character
there were likely to be a good many
people who owed him a bad turn lie
seems to have been a peppery old gentle-
man its quite likely is it not that he
had some enemies among liis neighbors 
 no as far as i can discover he was
very popular in the neighborhood the
indignation over his death was something

             
the four-pools mystery



tremendous when it first got out that
rad was accused of the crime there was
even talk of lynching him

   and the servants all appeared to be
fond of him 

   the old family servants were broken-
hearted at the news of his death they
had been for the most part born and
bred on the place and in spite of his
occasional harshness they loved the
colonel with the old-fashioned devotion
of the slave toward his master

   he was in his way exceedingly kind
to them the night that old uncle
eben died my uncle watched all night
by his bed

   its a queer situation jerry mut-
tered and relapsed into silence till we
reached the jail

  it was an ivy-covered brick building
set back from the street and shaded by-
trees

   rather more sumptuous than the
tombs jerry commented  shouldnt
mind taking a rest in it myself

  we found radnor pacing up and
down the small room in which he was
confined like a caged animal the anx-
iety and seclusion were beginning to tell
on his nerves

  he faced about quickly as the door
opened and at sight of me his face light-
ened he was growing pathetically
pleased at having any one to talk to

   rad i said with an air of cheer-
fulness which was not entirely assumed
 i hope were nearing the end of our
trouble at last this is mr patten-
jerry patten of new york who has
come to help me unravel the mystery

  it was an unfortunate beginning i
had told him before of jerrys connec-
tion with the patterson-pratt affair he
had half held out his hand as i com-
menced to speak but he dropped it now
with a slight frown

    dont think i care to be inter-
viewed he remarked curtly  i have
nothing to say for the benefit of the
post-dts patch

   oh youd better said jerry im-
perturbably  the post-despatch prints
the truth you know and some of the
other papers dont the truths always
best in the end i merely want to find
out what information you can give me
in regard to the ghost

   i will tell you nothing radnor
growled   am not giving statements
to the press

   mr gaillard said jerrv with an
assumption of gentle patience if you
will excuse my referring to what i know
must be a painful subject would you
miud telling me if the suspicion has ever
crossed your mind that your brother jef-
ferson may have returned secretly have
abstracted the bonds from the safe and
two weeks uter quite accidentally have
met colonergaillard alone in the cave 
radnor turned upon him in a sudden
fury i thought for a moment he was
going to strike him and i sprang for-
ward and caught his arm

   the gaillards may be a bad lot but
they are not liars and they are not cow-
ards they do not run away  thev stand
by the consequences of their acts

 terry bowed gravely	- 

   tust one more question and i am
through what happened to you that
day in the cave

   its none of your damned business 
i glanced apprehensively at jerry un-
certain as to how he would take this
he did not appear to resent it he
looked radnor over with an air of inter-
ested approval and his smile slowly
broadened-

   im glad to see youre game he re-
marked

   i tell you i dont know who killed
my father any more than you do rad-
nor cried  you neednt come here
asking me questions go and find the
murderer if you can and if you cant
hang me and be done with it

   i dont know that we need take up
any more of mr gaillards time said
jerry to me  ive found out about all i
wished to know well drop in again
he added reassuringly to radnor
 good afternoon

  as we went out of the door he turned
back a moment and added with a slightly
sharp undertone in his voice

   and the next time i come gaillard
youll shake hands 

  fumbling in his pocket he drew out
my telegram from the police commis-
sioner and tossed it on to the cot  in
the meantime theres something for you
to think about good-by

   do you mean- i asked as we


the all-story magazine

climbed back into the carriage  that
radnor did believe jeff guilty

   well not exactly i fancy he will
be relieved though to find that jeff was
two thousand miles away when the mur-
der was committed

  only once during the drive home did
terry exhibit any interest in his surround-
ings and that was when we passed
through the village of lambert corners

  he made me slow down to a walk and
explain the purpose of everyone of the
dozen or so buildings alongthe square
at  millers store  he suddenly decided
that he needed some stamps and i wait-
ed outside while he obtained them to-
gether with a drink in the private back
room

   nothing like getting the lay of the
land he remarked as he climbed back
into the carriage  that miller is a
picturesque old party he thinks its all
tommyrot that radnor gaillard had any-
thing to do with the crime rads a cus-
tomer of his and its a downright impo-
sition to lock the boy up where he cant
spend money

  for the rest of the drive jerry kept
silence and i did not venture to inter-
rupt it i had come to have a super-
stitious feeling that his silences were por-
tentous

  it was not until i stopped to open the
gate into our own home lane that he
suddenly burst out with the question

 where do the mathers people live 
 a couple of miles farther down the
pike-they have no connection whatever
with the business and dont know a thing
about it

   ah-perhaps not would it be too
late to drive over to-night

   yes said i  it would

   oh very well said he good-hu-
moredly  therell be time enough in
the morning

  i let this pass without comment but
on one thing i was resolved and that
was that polly mathers should never fall
into jerrys clutches

  jl well here we are i said as we
came in sight of the house  and the
took is expecting us

vso that is the gaillard house is it
fwne olcl place when was it built
 im not sure about  i imag-
ine

   and that row of shanties down
there

   are the haunted negro cabins

   ah 

  jerry rose in his seat and scanned
them eagerly-

   well have a look at them as soon
as  get something to eat really a
farm isnt so bad he remarked as he
stepped out upon the portico

  and is this solomon he inquired
as the old negro came forward to take
his bag  well solomon ive been
reading about you in the papers you
and i will have a talk by and by

chapter xvi

we search the abandoned cabins

   now said jerry as solomon and
the suit-case disappeared up-stairs  lets
have a look at those haunted cabins

   i thought you were hungry  

   well i am but i still have strength
enough to get that far solomon says
supper wont be ready for half an hour
and we havent half an hour to waste
im due in the city the day after to-
morrow remember

   you wont find anything i said
 ive searched every one of those cabins
myself and the hant didnt leave a trace
behind him

   i think ill just glance about with
my own eyes said jerry  reporters
sometimes see tilings you know where
corporation lawyers dont

  just as you please i shrugged
 four-pools is at your disposal

  i led the way across the lawn and into
the laurel growth jerry followed with
eyes eagerly alert the gruesome possibil-
ities of the place appealed to him he
pushed through the briers that surround-
ed the first cabin and came out on the
slope behind where he stood gazing
down delightedly at the dark waters of
the fourth pool

  gee this is great well run i
half-page picture and call it the
haunted tarn i didnt know
places really existed thought writer-
made em up

  come on he called plunc  v
to the walk  we must cat 

i dont want this scenerv t
the four-pools mystery



  yve commenced at the first cabin and
went down the row thoroughly and sys-
tematically at jerrys insistence one of
the stablemen brought a ladder and we
climbed into every loft finding nothing
but spiders and dust

  the last on the left being more
weather-proof than the others was used
as a granary a space six feet square
was left inside the door but for the rest
the room was filled nearly to the ceiling
with sacks of indian meal

   how about this-did you examine
this cabin  

   well really jerry there isnt much
room for a ghost here -

   ghosts dont require much room
how about the loft

   i didnt go up-you cant get at the
trap without moving all the meal

  i see jerry was examining the
three walls of sacks before us  now
here is a sack rather dirtier than the rest
and squashy it looks to me as if it
had had a good deal of rough handling
he pulled it to the floor as he spoke
and another with it a space some three
feet high was visible by crawling one
could make his way along without hit-
ting the ceiling

  come on said jerry scrambling
to the top of the pile and pulling me
after him  weve struck the trail of our
ghostly friend unless im very much mis-
taken look at that 

  he pointed to a muddy footmark
plainly outlined on one of the sacks

   dont disturb it we may want to
compare it with the marks in the cave
hello whats this the print of a
bare foot-thats our friend mose

  he took out a pocket-rule and made
careful measurements of both prints the
result he set down in a notebook i was
quite as excited now as jerry

  we crawled along on all fours until
we reached the open trap there was 
trace here of either spider-webs or dust
we scrambled into the loft without much
difficulty and found a large room with
sloping beams overhead and two small
windows innocent of glass at either end

  the room was empty but clean it
had been thoroughly swept and recently
jerry poked about but found nothing

   hm  he grunted  mose eleaned
well ah here we are

  lie paused before a horizontal beam
along the side-wall and pointed to a
little pile of ashes and a cigar-stub

   lie smokes cigars and good strong
ones-at least he isnt a lady did you
ever see a cigar like that before  
yes i said thats the kind the
colonel always smoked a fresh box
was stolen from the dining-room cup-
board a day or so after i got here solo-
mon said it was the hant but we sus-
pected it was solomon

   yyas the cupboard unlocked

   oh yes any of the house servants
could have got at it

   well said jerry poking his head
from the windows for a view of the
ground beneath  thats all there seems
to be here we might as well go down
we boosted up the two meal-bags
again and started back toward the house

  jerrys eyes studied his surroundings
keenly whether for the sake of the story
he was planning to write or the mystery
he was trying to solve i could only con-
jecture his glance presently fixed on
the stables where old uncle jake was
sitting on an upturned pail in the door-
way

   you go on he said  and have em
put dinner or supper or whatever you
call it on the table and ill be back in
three minutes i want to see what that
old fellow over there has to say in re-
gard to the ghost

  it was fifteen minutes later that jerry
reappeared

   well i inquired as i led the way
to the dining-room did you get any
news of the ghost  

  did i the society for psychical
research ought to investigate this neigh-
borhood theyd find more spirits in
half an hour than theyve found in their
whole past history

  jerrys attention during supper was
chiefly directed toward nancys fried
chicken and beat biscuits when he did
make any remarks he addressed them to
solomon rather than to me his ques-
tions principally concerned the house-
hold and the farm and solomon in vafti
endeavored to confine his replies to  yes
sah  no sah  jes so sah but iu
five minutes he was well start afoitnt
would have required a floodgate to stop
him


the all-story magazine

  in the midst of it jerry rose and dis-
missing me with a brief  ill join you
in the library later i want to talk to
solomon a few minutes bowed me out
and shut the door

  i was amused rather than annoyed by
this summary dismissal jerry had been
in the house not quite two hours and i
am sure that a third person looking on
would have picked me out for the
stranger jerrys way of being at ease
in any surroundings was absolutely inim-
itable

  he appeared in the library in the
course of half an hour with the apology
 i hope you didnt mind being turned
out servants are sometimes embar-
rassed you know about telling the tilth
before any of the family

   you didnt get much truth out of
solomon i retorted

   i dont know that i did jerry ad-
mitted with a laugh  there are the
elements of a good reporter in solomon
he has an imagination which i respect
thegaillards appear to be an interest-
ing family with hereditary tempers
that may be i doubtfully acqui-
esced

  hm jerry frowned and sol-
omon tells me tales of the colonel him-
self whipping the negroes-there cant
be any truth in that

   but there is i said  he didnt
hesitate to strike them when he was
angry i myself saw him beat a nigger
a few days ago and i recounted the
story of the chicken thief

   i see a man of that sort is likely
to have enemies he doesnt suspect and
how about cat-eye mose was colonel
gaillard in the habit of whipping him 
 so i understand but the more the
colonel whipped mose the fonder mose
appeared to grow of the colonel

    its a puzzling situation said jerry
he took off his coat and rolled up his
shirt-sleeves then shoving everything
back from one end of the big library-
table he settled himself in a chair and
motioned me to one opposite

  now see here he said you told
me you werent afraid of the truth just
be so kind as to tell it to me then now
exactly what sort of a fellow is radnor

i	want to know for several reasons

   well he did drink a little i said

 but he had stopped lately and as
for gambling several of the young men
around here have got into the way of
playing for rather high stakes but for a
month or so past rad had pulled up in
that too

   as for his ever having been disin-
herited that is a newspaper story pure
and simple i never heard anything of
the sort and the neighborhood has told
me pretty much all there is to know
within the last few days

   his father never turned him out of
the house then  

   never that i heard of he did leave
home once because his father insulted
him but he came back again

   that was forgiving commented
jerry in general though i under-
stand that the relations between the two
were rather strained

   at times they were i admitted
 but things had been going rather better
for the last few days

   until the night before the murder
they quarreled then and over a mat-
ter of money

   yes radnor makes no secret of it
 and if you will allow me to go a
step farther why did colonel gaillard
object to settling something on the boy 
 he wanted to keep him under his
thumb the colonel liked to rule and
he wished every one around him to be
dependent on his will

  i see said jerry radnor had
a real grievance then after all-just one
thing more on this point why did he
choose that particular time to make his
request  

  i	shrugged my shoulders

   youll have to ask radnor that i
remarked i had my own suspicions
but i did not wish to drag polly math-
erss name into the discussion

  jerry watched me a moment without
saying anything and then he too
shrugged his shoulders

   i wont go into the matter of rad-
nors connection with the hant just now
i should like to consider first his actions
on the day of the murder i have here
a report of the testimony taken at the
inquest but it is not so full as i could
wish in some particulars

  ii	you say that radnor and his father
did not speak at the breakfast-table
the four-pools mystery



how was it when you started on the
picnic  

   they both appeared to be in pretty
good spirits but i noticed that they
avoided each other

   did you notice radnor through the
day 

   not particularly

   did you see either him or the colonel
in the cave

   yes i was with the colonel most of
the time

   and how about radnor didnt you
see him at all

   oh yes i remember talking to him
once about some queerly shaped stalag-
mites he didnt hang around me nat-
urally while i was with his father

   and when you talked to him about
the stalagmites-was there any one else
with him at the time

   i believe miss mathers was there
   and he was carrying her coat  

    i really didnt notice

   at least he left it later in what you
call the gallery of the broken column
 yes

   i see said jerry  that the coroner
asked at this point if he were in the habit
of forgetting young ladies coats thats
more pertinent than many of the ques-
tions the coroner asked how about it
was he in the habit of forgetting young
ladies coats

   i really dont know jerry i said
somewhat testily

    its a pity youre not more observ-
ing he returned  for its rather im-
portant on the whole but never mind
ill find that out for myself did you
notice when he left the rest of the
party

   no there was such a crowd of us
that i didnt miss him

   very well well have a look at his
testimony he left the rest of you in
this same gallery of the broken column
went out strolled about the woods for
half an hour and then returned to the
hotel i fancy  strolled  is not precise-
ly the right word

   now that half hour in the woods is
an unfortunate circumstance had he
gone directly to the hotel from the cave
we could have proved an alibi without
any difficulty

   as it is he had plenty of time after

the others came out to remember that he
had forgotten the coat return for it re-
new the quarrel with his father and
after the fatal result make his way to
the hotel while the rest of the party
were still loitering in the woods

 jerry- i began

  he waved his hand in a gesture of
dissent

   oh im not saying thats what did
happen im just showing you that the
district attorneys theory is a physical
possibility

   now lets glance at the landlords
testimony a moment

   when radnor returned for his horse
he appeared angry excited and in a
hurry those are thelandlords words
and they are corroborated by the stable-
boy and several loungers about the hotel

   he was in a hurry-why because
he wished to get away before the others
came back he had suddenly decided
while he was in the woods-probably
when he heard them laughing and talk-
ing as they came out of the cave-that
he did not wish to see any one

  he was angry-mark that he
lashed his horse quite unnecessarily as he
galloped off and he was not solomon
gives me to understand in the habit of
maltreating horses

   now what do you make of all this
here is a young man with an unexpended
lot of temper on his hands-bent on be-
ing reckless bent on being just as bad
as he can be its as clear as daylight

   that boy never committed any crime
a man who had just murdered his father
would not be filled with anger no mat-
ter what ihe provocation had been he
might be overcome with horror fear re-
morse-a dozen different emotions but
anger would not be among them young
gaillard had not injured any one he
himself had been injured he was mad
through and through and he didnt care
who knew it

   he expended the most of his bel --
erency on his horse on the way home
by evening he was probably considerably
ashamed of his conduct he doesnt
care to talk about the matter for several
reasons fortunately solomon is not so
scrupulous

   i dont know what youre driving at
jerry said i
g

the ali-story magazine

     dont you he inquired  i dont
 know myself but  think i can make a
 pretty good guess well call on miss
 ivlv mathers in the morning and see
 if she cant help us out

    jerry i said that girl knows no
 more about the matter than  do

   he ignored my remark and went on
 with

     there are just two more points con-
 necting radnor gaillard with the murder
 that need explaining the footprints in
 the cave and the match-box the foot-
 prints i will dismiss for the present

    but the question of the match-box
 may repay a little investigation i want
  you to tell me precisely what happened
 in the woods that day before you went
 into the cave in the first place how
 many older people were there in the
 party  

    mr and mrs mathers a lady who
 was visiting them and colonel gail-
 lard

    there were two servants i under-
 stand besides this mose to help about
 the lunch whatdid they do

    well i dont know exactly i
 wasnt paving much attention i be-
 lieve they carried things over from the
 hotel collected wood for the fire and
 then went to a farm-house for water

     but mrs mathers it seems attended
 to lighting the fire

    yes she and the colonel made the
 fire and started the coffee

   ah said jerry with a note of
 satisfaction in his voice  the matter
 begins to clear was colonel gaillard
 in the habit of smoking

    he smoked one cigar after every
 meal

   never any more than that

    no the doctor had limited him
 the colonel grumbled about it regularly
 and always smoked the biggest cigar lie
 could find

     and where did he get his matches 
  solomon passed the brass match-box
 from the dining-room mantel-piece just
 as he passed it to us to-night

    colonel gaillard was not in the
 habit of carrying matches in his pockets
 thcr
  nn i think not

     we may safely assume said jerry
  that in this matter of making the fire

if the two were working together the
colonel was on his knees arranging the
sticks while mrs mathers was standing
by giving directions that  believe is
the usual division of labor

   well then they get to the point of
needing a light the colonel feels
through his pockets finds that he hasnt
a match and-what happens

   what did happen  broke in  was
that mrs mathers turned to a group of
us who were standing talking at one side
and asked if any of us had a match and
rad handed her his box that i the
last any one remembers about it

   exactly said jerry  and i think
i can tell you the rest you can see for
yourself what took place mrs mathers
went back to the spot where they were
building the fire and the colonel took the
match-box from her

   no man is ever going to stand by and
watch a woman strike a match-he can
do it so much better himself

   at this point mrs mathers-by her
own testimony-was called away and
she doesnt remember anything further
about the box

   the colonel was left to light the fire
alone he recognized the box as his
sons and he dropped it into his pocket
at another time perhaps he would have
walked over and handed it back but
not then the two were not speaking
to each other later at the time of the
struggle in the cave the box fell from
the old mans pocket and formed a most
damaging piece of circumstantial evi-
dence against his son

   on the whole i had arrived at my
own conclusions from reading the
papers what extra data i needed i
managed to glean from solomons lies

   and as for you he added gazing
across at me with an imperturbable grin
 i think you were wise in deciding to
be a corporation lawyer

chapter xvii

jerry arrives at a conclusion

   and now said jerry lighting a
fresh cigar and after a few preliminary
puffs settling down to work again  we
will consider the case of cat-eye mose
it wont be my fault if we dont make a
the four-pools mystery



beautiful story out of him you your-
self i believe hold the opinion that he
committed the murder

   i am sure of it i cried

  in that case laughed jerry i
should be inclined to think him inno-
cent

  i shrugged my shoulders there
was nothing to be gained by getting
angry

  if jerry chose to regard the solving
of a murder mystery in the light of a
joke i had nothing to say though i
did think he might have realized that to
me at least it was a serious matter

   and you base your suspicions do
you not upon the fact that he has queer
eyes  

  not entirely

   upon what then  

   upon the fact that he took part in
the struggle which ended in my uncles
death

   well certainly that does seem rather
conclusive-there is no mistake about the
footprints 

   none whatever the mathers negroes
both wore shoes

   in that case i suppose its fair to
assume that mose took part in the strug-
gle it says here that the bootmarks
of two different men are visible

   thats the sheriffs opinion i re-
plied  but i myself cant make out
anything but the marks of mose and the
colonel i examined everything care-
fully but its awfully mixed up you
know

   as i understand it said jerry
 mose has the reputation of being a
harmless peaceable fellow not very
bright but always good-natured he
never resented an injury was never
known to quarrel with any one took
what was given him and said thank you

   he loved colonel gaillard and
watched over his interests as jealously
as a dog well now is a man who has
had this reputation all his life a man
whom everybody trusts very likely to go
off the hook as suddenly as that and-
with no conceivable motive-brutally
kill the master he has served so faith-
fully

   it is very possible i said  that
people were deceived in mose i have
been suspicious of him from the moment

i laid eyes  him you may think it
unfair to judge a man from his physical
appearance but i wish you could once
see cat-eye mose yourself and you
would know what i mean

   one night he drove radnor and me
home from a party and i could actually
see his eyes shining in the dark its
the most gruesome thing i ever saw
and take that on top of his habits-he
carries snakes around in the front of his
shirt-really one suspects him of any-
thing

   i hope he isnt dead jerry mur-
mured wistfully  id like a personal
interview

   he sat sunk down in his chair for sev-
eral minutes intently examining the end
of his fountain-pen

    hm he said rousing himself  its
time we had a shy at the ghost

   well i said  the first definite
thing that reached the house was the
night of my arrival when the roast
chicken was stolen ive told you that
in detail

   and it was that same night that
aunt what-ever-her-name-is saw the
ghost in the laurel walk

  i nodded

   did she say what it looked like

   it was white

   and when you searched the cabins
did you go into the one where the grain
is stored 

   no mose dropped his torch at the
entrance and anyway rad said there
was no use in searching it it was al-
ready full to the brim with sacks of corn-
rneal

   do you think that radnor was try-
ing to divert you from the scent

   no i am sure he hadnt a suspicion
himself

   and what did the thing look like
that you saw mose carrying to the cabins
in the night

   it seemed to be a large black bun-
dle i have thought since that it might
have been clothes or blankets or some-
thing of that sort

   so much for the first night said
jerry-  now how soon did the ghost
appear again	vv

  various things were stolen after
that and the servants attributed it to the
hant but the first direct knowledge i


the all-story magazine

had was the night of the party when
radnor acted so strangely i told you
of his going back in the night

  he was carrying something too

   yes he had a black bundle-it might
have been clothes

   and after that he and mose were
in constant consultation

   yes they both encouraged the be-
lief in the hant among the negroes and
did their best to keep every one away
from the laurel walk i overheard mose
several times telling stories to the other
negroes about the terrible things the
hant would do if he caught them

   and he himself didnt show any fear
over the stories

  not the slightest appeared rather
to enjoy them

   and radnor how did he take the
matter

   he was moody and irritable

   how did you explain the matter to
yourself 

   i was afraid he had fallen into the
clutches of some one who was threaten-
ing him possibly levying blackmail

   but you didnt make any attempt to
discover the truth

    well it was rads own affair and i
didnt want the appearance of spying
i did keep my eyes open as much as i
could

    and the colonel how did he take all
this excitement about the hant

   it bothered him considerably but
rad kept him from hearing it as much as
he could

   when did the hant appear again
after the party 

   oh by that time all sorts of ru-
mors were running about among the
negroes the whole place was haunted
and several of the farm-hands had left
but the next thing that we heard di-
rectly was in the early evening before
the robbery when mose appearing ter-
ribly frightened said he had seen the
hant rising in a cloud of blue smoke
out of the sink-hole

   and how did the colonel and rad-
nor take this

   the colonel was angry because he
had been bragging about mose not being
afraid and rad was dazed he didnt
know what to think he hustled mose out
of the way before he could lie questioned

  and what did you think

   well  fancied at the time that he
had really seen something but as i
thought it over in the light of later
events i came to the conclusion that he
was shamming both then and in the
middle of the night when he roused the
house

   that is you wished to think him
shamming in order to prove his com-
plicity in the robbery and the murder
and so you twisted the facts to suit your
theory 

   i dont think you can say that i
returned somewhat hotly-  its merely
a question of interpreting the facts

   he didnt gain much by raising all
that hullabaloo in the middle of the
night

   why yes that was done in order to
throw suspicion on the hant

  oh i see laughed jerry well
now lets get to the end of this matter
was any more seen of the hant after
that night  

    no at least not directly for five
or six days every one was so taken up
with the robbery that the hant excite-
ment rather died down then i believe
there were some rumors among the
negroes but nothing much reached the
house

   and since the murder nothing what-
ever has been seen of the hant  

  i shook my head

  just give me a list of the things
that were stolen

   well the roast chicken a box of
cigars some shirts off the line a suit of
rads pajamas a french novel some
brandy quite a lot of things to eat-
fresh loaves of bread preserves a boiled
ham sugar coffee

   oh any amount of stuff the
negroes simply helped themselves and
laid it to the hant one of the car-
riages was left out one night and in
the morning the cushions were gone and
two lap-robes at the same time a
water-pail was taken and a pair of
jakes overalls and then to end up
came the robbery of the safe

   the hant had catholic tastes any
of the things turned up since

    yes several things such as blankets
and clothes and dishes have gradually
drifted back
the four-pools mystery



   the carriage cushions and lap-robes
ever find tllem  

   never a trace and why any one
should want em i dont know

  what color were the lap-robes

   plain black broadcloth

  jerry got up and paced about a few
moments and then came back and sat
down

   one thing is clear he said  there
are two hants

  two hants what do you mean
just what i say suppose for con-
venience we call them hant number one
and hant number two number one oc-
cupied apartments over the grain bin and
haunted the laurel walk he was white
-i dont wonder at that if he spent
much time crawling over those flour
sacks

   he smoked cigars and read french
novels mose waited on him and radnor
knew about him-and didnt get much
enjoyment out of the knowledge it
took money to get rid of him-a hundred
dollars down and the promise of more
to come

   radnor himself drove him off in the
carriage the night he left and mose
obliterated all traces of his presence so
much for number one

   as for number two he appeared
three or four days before the robbery
and haunted pretty much the whole
place especially the region of the sink-
hole in appearance he was nine feet
tall transparent and black

   smoke came from his mouth and
blue flames from his eyes there was a
sulfurous odor about him he was
first seen rising out of the sink-hole and
there is a passage in the bottom of the
sink-hole that leads straight down to
hell solomon is my authority

   i asked him how he explained the
apparition and he reckoned it was the
ghost of the slave who was beaten to
death and that since his old master had
come back  to haunt the laurel walk he
had come back to haunt his old master

   that sounds to me like a plausible
explanation as soon as its light ill
have a look at the sink-hole

  jerry i said disgustedly that
may make a very picturesque newspaper
story but it doesnt help much in un-
raveling the mystery

   it helps a good deal i would not
like to swear to the flames or sulfur or
the passage down to hell but the fact
that he was tall and black and comes
from the sink-hole is significant he
was black-mark that-so were the
stolen lap-robes 

   now you see how the matter stands
on the night of the robbery while
ghost number one was out driving with
radnor ghost number two entered the
house through the open library window
found the safe ajar and helped himself

   lets consider what he took-five
thousand dollars in government bonds
two deeds an insurance policy and a
quart of small change-a very suggestive
lot of loot if you think about it enough

   after the robbery he disappeared
nothing seen of him for five or six days
then he turned up again for a day or
so and finally disappeared forever so
much for hant number two

  	 hes the party were after he cer-
tainly robbed the safe and he possibly
committed the murder as to that i wont
have any proof until i see the cave

  he stretched his arms with a laugh

   oh this isnt so bad all weve
got to do now is to identify those two
ghosts

   im glad if you think its so easy
i said somewhat sullenly  but i will
tell you one thing if you go to basing
any deductions on solomons stories
youll find yourself bumping against a
stone wall

   well have rad over to dinner with
us to-morrow night jerry declared

  he rose and pulled out his watch

   its a quarter before ten i think its
time you went to bed you look about
played out you havent been sleeping
much of late

   no i cant say that i have

   i ought to have come down at once
said jerry  but im always so blamed
afraid of hurting peoples feelings

  i stared slightly i had never consid-
ered that one of jerrys weak points but
as he seemed to be quite in earnest i
let the remark pass

   do you think i could wake up one
of the stablemen and get him to drive
me to the village i know its pretty
late but ive got to send a couple of
telegrams
	the all-story magazine

  telegrams i demanded where
to

  jem laughed

   well i must send a word to the
post-despatch to the effect that the
luray mystery grows more mysterious
every hour that the police have been
wasting their energies on the wrong
scent but that the post-despatchs spe-
cial correspondent lias arrived on the
scene and that we may accordingly look
for a speedy solution-

  what is the second one tasked
 to your friend the police commis-
sioner of seattle

   you dont think that jeff-

   my dear fellow i dont think any-
thing unless i have some facts to think
about dont look so nervous im not
accusing him of anything i merely want
more details than you got im a news-
paper man remember and i like local
color even in telegrams

   and now go to bed and for heav-
ens sake go to sleep the case is in
the hands of the post-despatchs young
man and you neednt worry any more

jerry finds the bonds

   i was wakened the next morning by
jerry clumping into my room dressed in
riding-breeches and boots freshly spat-
tered with mud they were radnors
clothes jerry had taken me at my word
and was thoroughly at home

    hello old man  he said sitting on
the edge of the bed  been asleep
havent you sorry to wake you but
weve got a days work ahead hope
you dont mind my borrowing radnors
togs i didnt come down prepared for
riding

   solomon gave em to me seemed to
think that rad wouldnt need em any
more oh solomon and i are great
friends he added with a laugh as he
suddenly appeared to remember the ob-
ject of his visit and commenced a search
through his pockets

   i sat up in bed and watched him im-
patiently it was evident that he had
some news and also that he was going
to be as leisurely as possible about im-
parting it

   this is a pretty country he re-
marked as he finished with his coat-
pockets and commenced on the waist-
coat  it would be almost worth living
in if many little affairs like this occurred
to keep things going

  really jerry- i cried when you
refer to my uncles murder as a  little
affair i think youre going too far

   oh i beg your pardon said jerry
good-naturedly  i guess i am incor-
rigible i didnt know colonel gaillard
personally you see and im so used to
murders that ive come to think its the
only natural way of dying

   anyhow he added as he finally
produced a yellow envelope  ive got
something here that will interest you it
explains why our young friend radnor
didnt want to talk

  he tossed the envelope on the bed and
i eagerly tore out the telegram it was
from the police commissioner in seattle
and it said

    jefferson gaillard returned seattle
  may seventh after six weeks absence
  said to have visited old home virginia
  appeared to be in funds

   what does it mean    asked

  it means said jerry that weve
spotted ghost number one it was clear
from the first that radnor was trying to
shield some one even at the expense of
his own reputation that narrowed our
search considerably leaving women out
of the case it pointed pretty straight to-
ward his elder brother

   so much of your theory was correct
the only trouble was that you carried it
too far you made him commit both the
robbery and the murder then when
you found a part of your theory broke
down you rejected the whole of it

   you see how the matter stood teff
gaillard was pretty desperately in need
of money probably the debt was not
entirely honest may have been misap-
propriating funds or something of that
sort seattle too hot to hold him and he
lit out and came east

   he applied to radnor but radnor
was in a tight place himself and couldnt
lay his hands on anything except what
his father had given him for a birthday
present that was tied up in another
investment and if he converted it into
the four-pools mystery	

cash it would be at a sacrifice so it
ran along for a week or so while rad
was casting about for a means of get-
ting his brother out of the way without
any fresh scandal

   but moses suddenly taking to see-
ing hants precipitated matters realiz-
ing that his fathers patience had reached
its limit and that he couldnt keep you
off the scent much longer he determined
to borrow the money for jeffs journey
back to seattle and to close up his own
investment

   that same night he drove jeff to
the station at kennisburg  the washing-
ton express does not stop at lambert
junction and anyway kennisburg is a
bigger station and travelers excite less
comment this isnt deduction  its fact

i	rode to kennisburg this morning and
proved it

   the station-man remembers selling
radnor gaillard a ticket to washington
in the middle of the night about three
weeks ago some anan who waited out-
side and whose face the agent did not
see boarded the train and rad drove
off home alone the ticket-seller does
not know rad personally but lie says
that he knows him by sight so much
for that

   rad came home and went to bed
when he came down-stairs in the morn-
ing he was met by the information that
the hant had robbed the safe you can
see what instantly jumped into his mind
-some way somehow jeff had taken
those bonds-and yet figure on it as he
might he could not see how it was pos-
sible

   the robbery seemed to have occurred
while he was away could jeff merely
have pretended to leave might he in
some way have got back those are the
questions that were bothering radnor
he vjis honest in saying that he could
not imagine how the bonds had been
stolen and yet he was also honest in not
wanting to know the truth

   he might have confided in me 
said

   it would have been a good deal
wiser for him to do so but in order to
understand rads point of view you
must take into account jeffs character
he appears to have been a reckless
dashing headstrong but exceedingly at-

     	s

tractive fellow his father put up with
his excesses for six years before the final
quarrel

   cat-eye mose so old jake tells me
moped for months after his disappear-
ance rad as a little fellow wor-
shiped his bad but charming brother
there you have it jeff turns up again
with a hard-luck story and mose and
radnor both go back to their old allegi-
ance he wants his presence kept a
secret and they do so

   after the robbery radnor is too sick
at the thought that jeff may have be-
trayed him to want to do anything but
hush the matter up at the news of
the murder he does not know what to
think he will not believe jeff guilty
and yet lie does not see anv other wav
out

  jerry paused a moment and leaned
forward with an excited gleam in his
eye

   that he said  is the whole truth
about ghost number one our business
now is to track down ghost number two
and here as a starter are the missing
bonds

  he tossed a pile of mildewed papers
on the bed and met my astonishment
with a triumphant chuckle

  it was true all live of the missing
bonds were there the may first coupons
still uncut also the deeds and insurance
policy just as they had left the safe ex-
cept that they were damp and mud-
stained

  i	stared for a moment too amazed to
speak

  good heavens jerry where did
you find them i gasped at last

  jerry shrugged his shoulders with a
tantalizing laugh

   exactly where i thought id find
them oh ive been out early this
morning i saw the sun rise and break-
fasted in kennisburg about six-forty-
five im ready for another breakfast
though

   hurry up and get dressed weve
got a days work before us im off to
the stables to talk  horses with u ncle
jake when youre ready for breakfast
send solomon after me

   jerry i implored  where on the
face of the earth did you find those
bonds

the burglary of sandmouth

by walter e grogan

  who aims to chtat others
  must watch out that he is
  not hoist with his own petard

the little town of sandmouth was
in a state of extreme excitement
for weeks it had panted for
something to break the monotony
of the dull months preceding the summer
season now it had come with a venge-
ance

  the shop belonging to mr william
jarvis had been broken into and jewelry
abstracted in the first glow of enthusi-
asm reports vaulted high as to the prob-
able loss thousands were mentioned
tens of thousands hinted at a jewelers
shop the principal jewelers shop of a
prosperous east-coast seaside resort looms
large in local eyes as a golconda of
wealth and in front of the season just
when the new stock was laid in and the
bills of the summer season sale already
printed

  some one early in the forenoon haz-
arded that the work was the work of a
person who knew sandmouth and knew
jarvis the remark created consterna-
tion

   and him in the town yesterday said
owen jones a draper breaking the si-
lence fallen cloud-like upon the office of
the ring o bells

  mr william jarvis was a little gray-
haired man with a hard mouth and a
determined chin his little black eyes
deep set looked out from undeiistraggly
gray brows in a challenging fashion he
was a close man-close-fisted close-
hearted close-mouthed sandmouth paid
him the deference due to his position

bought its rings and trinkets at his shop
but did not love him

  he was a hectoring man and bullied
his fellow members upon the council
and like all great men in little places
he was absurdly jealous

  the jeweler had a daughter-emily
jarvis some people held that that was
his one redeeming point others regarded
her as the chief jewel in his shop

  in reality she was just such a pretty
laughing healthy lovable girl as en-
couraged extravagance in compliment
she helped in the shop and made out
the bills in the neatest of handwriting
biting her penholder with her pearly
teeth and shaking her curls in despair
when she had to compute two and a half
per cent discount

  being a close man and a good business
man william jarvis was well aware of
the value of em visitors were known
to buy dozens of his sandmouth  sou-
venir spoon one at a time merely for
the pleasure of looking at her and so
being aware of her business value will-
iam jarvis regarded all efforts on the
part of young bachelor tradesmen to
transfer her attraction to their own shops
with a jaundiced eve not even the case
of expensive engagement-rings was more
safely nd jealously guarded than em

  she was luckily of a happy disposition
and little tempted to rebel she laughed
her way light-heartedly enough until
a few months previous to the sandmouth
sensation that was a month after the
engagement of a new assistant

  his name was charles gower a dark-
haired handsome young giant whose
advent changed the fortunes of the
sandmouth football club hitherto
william jarvis had eschewed handsome
assistants gowers remarkable indiffer-
the burglary of sandmouth



ence as to wages tempted him and he
succumbed not without twinges of un-
easiness yet the new employee proved
an admirable salesman business was
brisker than it had ever been before dur-
ing the dull season and old jarvis kept
him longer than his better judgment
suggested

  he argued that if he remained in the
shop with his daughter and young gower
as much as possible nothing in the way
of love-making could happen

  which wps unworthy of his wisdom

  one day william jarvis discovered
something-a kiss a note possibly only
a look for old jarvis could be sharp
ems manner had rendered him sus-
picious she had become self-conscious
and given to sudden flushings to odd
moods to tears unaccountably and to
smiles quite as unaccountably as the tears

  the interview that followed-between
william jarvis and his assistant-in the
glass-fronted room leading out of the
shop where the old man had his repair-
ing-bench was brief but unpleasant

   shes none for you  snapped the
old man finally

   em loves me protested charles
manfully i have a good trade and you
know as well as i do that i work well

    you are only an assistant

   	i can rise

  not in my shop i wont have it
my girl is mine and i keep her d you
see look at my position im a coun-
cilor-youre an assistant nothing more

   youre afraid if i married her as
youd lose some custom  charles cried
unwisely

 the accusation was near enough to the
truth to anger the old man exceedingly
set in plain words it sounded terribly
selfish

   youre an impudent rascal  f you
were ems only chance you shouldnt
have her  the old man raised his
voice

  why demanded the young man

    because i dont like you personally
nor your ways nor your deeds i was
going to give you the sack on friday
before ever i caught you at your under-
hand dealings with my daughter

   i kept it secret because em would
have it so she was afraid of you why
were you going to give me the sack 

  the old man hot with anger cudgeled
his brains for a reply lie had lied and
he must substantiate his lie suddenly
a suggestion came into his brain that
made him smile in an ugly fashion

  	theres been some things missing
and cash

  the young man took a step forward
every vestige of color had deserted his
face his eyes blazed

   what do you mc-an mr jarvis

   i mean nothing said the old man
steadily not flinching  i have missed
things and i was going to get rid of
you

  do you accuse me charles de-
manded

   no i have no proof but youd
better go to-night

    you are trying to blacken my charac-
ter in a cowardly way if you were
not ems father you should answer for
this 

   aye bluster-thats the way ive
got no proof i tell you youre safe
enough but you stay no longer in my
shop

  the wrangle ran on for a few minutes
longer and then charles flung out of the
inner room emily who was in the shop
trembling at the sound of the angry
voices came to his side

   stand away em   cried her father
 you shall have nothing to do with him

i	have discharged him

   i love him em answered fearlessly

  you shall not her father thun-
dered

   when the time is ripe i shall come
for her said charles  and she will
go with me nothing that you say will
stop her that is so sweetheart is it
not

   that is so charles she answered

   a pauper-and worse  sneered old
jarvis  be off before i turn you out 

   i shall not always be a pauper and
be assured i shall come one day for
emily

  with that charles gower turned on
his heel and quitted the shop and three
hours lter quitted the town of sand-
mouth

  old william jarvis hinted industri-
ously that his last assistant had been
dishonest and some believed him but
the many did not


the a li-story magazine

  emily grew sad and pale whether
she heard from charles no one knew
her father said no word to her about
her lover after the day on which he dis-
missed him but in his heart he knew
that whenever charles gower came for
her she would go hatred of the man
who had made him lie grew fiercer even
than his desire to keep the attraction of
his daughter in his shop

  another assistant an elderly man with
a gaunt figure and long hair was en-
gaged and the broken love-story was
three months old when right in front
of the summer season came the sensa-
tional news that william jarviss shop
had been robbed

  the house a three-storied building in
the main street had a small back yard
with a door in the wall leading into a
lane used for the discharge of merchan-
dise to other shops the whole of the
ground floor was given over to the jew-
elers business the iron-shuttered shop
came first then the little windowed room
looking into the shop where mr jarvis
had his bench and at the back a
workshop

  the door leading into the back yard
was bolted inside at night besides being
locked in this workshop slept a fox-
terrier an admirable house-dog the
upper part of the house composed the
living-rooms

  on the morning of the burglary will-
iam jarvis came down to find the back-
door bolt cut out evidently by a chisel
and the door unlocked a hasty glance
around the shop discovered the fact that
a case of gold watches and a tray of plain
gold wedding and chased keeper rings
were empty mr jarvis opened the
door of the shop and called a police-
man

  this was a little after seven in the
morning

  the constable entered the shop looked
around and gave his opinion that there
had been a burglary examining the
iron shutters which were still up and
the front door he added that an entrance
must have been made from the rear

  as the bolt of the back door had
been bodily cut out this surmise did not
impress mr jarvis sergeant wynn
passing the door was immediately sum-
moned by the constable who scratched

his head in thankful relief at so quickly
transferring the responsibility of inves-
tigation

  sergeant wynn made a morevor less
intelligent examination the dog who
barked at him when he entered the work-
shop puzzled him greatly

  	theres no doubt the house has been
entered from the lane mr jarvis he
said  the door into the lane was
scaled its easy enough for a tall man
there are scratches all the way up as
if the mans boots hit against it in pulling
himself up it rained yesterday and the
back yard must have been soaking wet
there are footmarks just inside the back
door into the house they will be use-
ful ive taken down the measurements
whoever did it knew the place for hes
cut out the bolt exactly but i dont
understand the dog being quiet didnt
you hear him mr jarvis 

    heard nothing knew nothing until
i came down tims a good house-dog-
would have been sure to bark unless he
knew the step and liked the man

   unless he knew the step  sergeant
wynn caught him up briskly  there
you are some one who knows the dog
and knew exactly where the bolt was
and has been able to take impressions of
the keys do you suspect any one

   no said mr jarvis slowly he
thought a while and then repeated
 no

   ah   commented the sergeant look-
ing wise  weve both got bur thoughts
sir ill leave the constable here and
look around i must report to the su-
perintendent when he comes in from ox-
ter

  exactly at twelve oclock sandmouth
received another shock sergeant wynn
walked down high street with his hand
on charles gowers shoulder and
they disappeared in the direction of the
police station

  at two oclock public opinion shook
its head over charles gower things
looked very black against him tim the
dog was known to be very fond of him
and who could know better than he the
exact position of the bolt or have greater
facilities for taking impressions of the
keys a clever workman too al-
ways making something in the smith-
ing line
the burglary of sandmouth



  the only keys never in his possession
were the keys of the safe and the safe
had not been tampered with three or
four volunteers had come forward as-
serting that they saw him loitering in
the lane behind the shop quite late at
night he had refused to say where he
had been the previous evening although
the landlady of the little inn where he
had put up for the night declared that
he did not return until three in the
morning

  and most damning of all facts the
muddy footmarks discovered by the ser-
geant were found to fit his boots so ex-
actly that no doubt at all could be en-
tertained that they were liis public
opinion held that matters looked uncom-
monly black for charles gower

  emily refused to believe that charles
was guilty he was incapable of
theft she asserted he was the truest
most honorable man ever known by
sandmouth or the rest of the world to
boot mr william jarvis looked at her
sadly then gravely shook his head over
the outburst she had just heard the
news of her lovers arrest-a fact hither-
to withheld from her by the forethought
of her father

  in the shop stood the superintendent
of police a thin alert military-looking
man behind him was the sergeant

    fie was seen outside at the back late
last night mr jarvis said slowly  he
returned to his room at three and he re-
fuses to account for his time except that
he was up on the cliff-a likely story 

   you are cruel father  emily cried
her head was thrown back her eyes were
defiant more especially defiant of the
superintendent who smiled lazily  he
refused to account for his movements
in order to shield me there its out
and i dont care who knows it he
came here last night to see me that
was after twelve-at night let me
speak father its true

   i waited until you were asleep and
crept down and opened the doors the
back door and the door into the lane
it was raining and he stood just inside
the door he wanted me to elope with
him he knew that it was hopeless to
get your consent i knew that also i
stood out for some time then i con-
sented

  mr william jarvis shook his head
again very sadly

    the folly of girls bewitched by a
good-looking scamp she is trying to
shield him mr andrews he said ad-
dressing the superintendent with a rising
note in his voice as if anger were be-
ginning to whip him did she go
she was going to elope she didnt
why because there is no truth in her
tale

   because my door was locked i was
to steal out in ail hour and meet him
on the cliff i had to put my things
together in a bag-there was some of
my mothers jewelry-i wanted that
w hen i came to open my door it was
locked

   yes said mr jarvis  i locked
it-i locked it at half past eleven when
i went to bed the servant found it
locked this morning i saw gower
sneaking about the shop-door yesterday
so i locked you in to make sure i told
the sergeant so this morning he can
bear me out the servant can bear ms
out

   oh father you are lying away my
happiness  emily cried out  it
wasnt charles he couldnt do such a
thing i know he is innocent-and ill
marry him in spite of anything 

   f wouldnt say anything more miss
said the sergeant in a fatherly manner
 it may hurt your young man

  mr andrews the superintendent
looked up and smiled

   ill just go over the house mr jar-
vis although the case seems fairly clear
he said  neat steps those of yours-
for reaching the top shelves i suppose 

   yes growled mr jarvis

   only used in the shop  

   only used in the shop assented mr
jarvis  not strong enough for rough
work

  mr andrews was gone half an hour
during which at his request mr jarvis
remained in the shop  to look after his
daughter as the superintendent sug-
gested emily sat staring before her
weeping quietly from time to time

  both turned at the sound of the su-
perintendents entrance both perhaps a
little relieved mr andrews was still
smiling softly

a careless man the thief mr jar-


iiie all-story magazine

vis he said- a very careless man i
am glad you had nothing disturbed it
has made investigation very easy the
case is quite clear new

  quite clear repeated mr jarvis
a little uncertainly

   it is hardly a case of theft hut of
paltry revenge the superintendent con-
tinued

   revenge the scamp had some rea-
son for revenge perhaps but theft is
theft whatever the reason

  ihe superintendent nodded and his
smile deepened

  of course the behavior of your dog
gave the first clue

  he was good to the dog i admit
that said mr jarvis

   then the knowledge of the exact

position of the bolt-

   quite so mr jarvis agreed eagerly
 are you insured against burglary
mr jarvis 

   no-no its a dead loss to me
the rates are so high i never insure
not a dead loss ive found the
missing articles

   what  screamed mr jarvis then
he mopped his forehead and stared at
mr andrews open-mouthed

   at least i know where to find them
they are in the box-room up in your
pent-roof

  mr jarvis tried to speak but failed

   it was a paltry thing to do mr
jarvis said the superintendent severely
a mean contemptible thing if you
had succeeded you would have had a
mans ruin on your conscience thank
god earnestly that you did not succeed
what-what do you mean mr
jarvis suddenly looking very old said
lamely

   last night you were disturbed and

coming down-stairs found your daugh-
ter talking to charles gower instead
of confronting them you listened and
as you listened you hatched a horrible
plot to ruin a young man

   when your daughter returned to her
room you locked her in then you came
down-stairs and cut out that bolt with
a chisel theres a heap of chips in-
side-it is palpable that it was cut out
from the inside  doubt for the con-
venience of the light but it was care-
less you ought to have used a lantern
ihen you took the steps from the shop
outside into the lane caught hold of
the top of the wall and scratched marks
with your boots

   there were mud-stains oq the legs
of the steps and you must have knocked
against the back door bringing them in
for there is a new scratch on the door and
traces of paint on the top of the steps
then you took the jewelry up to the box-
room which is i discovered rarely used

   the dust has been newly disturbed
on the short ladder going up to it and
the trap-door has been recently opened
a pair of goloshes still damp explained
why your feet left no mud-stains the
worst of it mr jarvis is that i do not
set how  can arrest you for stealing
your own property

  mr jarvis struggled to his feet and
glared wildly

   so-so youve found out  he cried
 well im-im not sorry it was a
sudden-a sudden temptation and now
-oh god im glad-im glad

  at thi point mr jarvis collapsed in
a fainting condition

  mr and mrs charles gower have now
a prosperous business in oxter and mr
jarvis is by no means the hard man he
was

this he practically does only to find die calendar party not aboard of her and after
being-robbed by her captain is landed in antwerp without a cent

    he sees mrs hallam arrive and take a cab which he follows until it stops before a
cheap water-front hotel mrs hallam watches patiently from the cab-window until mul-
ready and calendar emerge from the hotel and make for the wharves kirkwood losing
interest in the lady follows the men and seeing them put out for the alethea which is
anchored near by does likewise on the ship he watches them hide the gladstone bag and
then with the effrontery of a pirate enters the cabin holds them up locks them in a siatc-
room and with the bag returns to shore and goes to the hotel where he surmises dorothy
is he goes up to her room and is met by mrs hallam who is persuading the girl to go
with her but finally after threatening to expose the lady succeeds in getting the gir tu

  for a time they laughed and chatted
pretending fiutt all was well with them
ihen the gir nestling her head in a
corner of the dingy cushions smiled
drowsily upon kirkwood through her
drooping lashes and slept a soft color
ebbing and hewing in her cheeks the
shadow of a sleepy smile quivering about
the sensitive scarlet lips the wind
through the open window working won-
ders with the sunlit glory of her hair

  dunkirk halted their progress and
they changed cars - the ubiquitous
hobbs a hateful shadow in the distance
calais they reached in the middle of the
forenoon with a three-hour wait con-
fronting them before the departure of
the dover packet

  an anxious time-doubly anxious to
kirkwood both itecause of hobbs the
persistent and for that reason which he
had kept secret from the girl lest she
should grieve needlessly time enough
to agitate her on that head when he had
reached the absolute limit of his re-
sources

  moreover between dunkirk and ca-
lais they had decided upon a plan of
action involving a temporary separation
with all its attendant perils neither
could forget that calendar might be in
calais presuming that hobbs had
reached him by wire he could readily
have anticipated their arrival whether
by sea in the brigantine or by land-
the direct route via brussels and lille

if they were unhappily to meet him-

neither cared to contemplate the possi-
bilities involved in such a denouement

  when they left the train at the jure
centrale kirkwoods satchel held only
a majority of the girls belongings
which had been transferred from her own
traveling-bag to make room for the
gladstone further he had armed her
with one of the revolvers

  disregarding the importunities of the
cabmen they passed through the depot
and into the quiet streets of the seaport
hobbs hovering anxiously in the offing
then at a deserted corner they separated
the girl turning quickly out of sight to
make her way to the terminus hotel
kirkwood swinging sharply to deal with
the disturbed mr hobbs

  when this maneuver was executed the
mate was in the middle of the block as

kirkwood moved toward him purposeful-
ly he stopped short and initiated a swift
flanking movement across-street kirk-
wood hot with righteous wrath proved
too quick for the cockney on reaching
the farther sidewalk hobbs was dis-
gusted to find their relative positions
unchanged save that possibly kirkwood
had drawn a little closer

   abruptly the mate took to his heels
kirkwood satisfied pursued until con-
vinced that hobbs could not pick up the
trail again then hailed a fiacre and load
himself driven to the american consul-
ate

   some time later crimson and smart-
ing with shame and humiliation he
made a quick exit from the consulate
doors leaving an amused official repre-
sentative of his countrys government
with the impression of having been en-
tertained to the point of boredom for
half an hour by an exceptionally clumsy
but persistent liar

  and hobbs was strolling down the
street over the way kicking up his heels
and whistling an air maudlin with senti-
ment

  kirkwood paid him no further heed
whatsoever hopelessly abandoning the
attempt to shake him off resigned to a
future wherein the obnoxious little lon-
doner should form a component part of
the landscape wherever one turned ones
eye besides grim care was now setting
the pace for him in deadly earnest

  by noon the suspense had grown too
great for endurance and kirkwood
throwing caution and their understand-
ing to the winds proceeded directly for
the hotel at the gare maritime and sent
up his name to miss calendar

   the girl met him in the public lounge
bringing with her the traveling-bag
looking marvelously refreshed by her
ninety minutes of complete repose and
privacy kirkwood on the contrary
was so fagged and distraught that at
the sight of his care-worn countenance
she hurried to him with a low pitying
cry

    oh nothing new he told her with
a sorry ghost of a grin  only there are
no signs of mr calendar and i knew
you had to have something to eat

   they were lingering over dejeuner a
hi fourchettc and feeling somewhat
chase of the gladstone bag



better when word was brought to them
that the steamer was  the point of
sailing

outwardly composed but inwardly in
a tremor they boarded the packet meet-
ing with  misadventure whatsoever-
if one excepts the circumstance that
when the hotel and restaurant bills were
settled and through tickets to london
bought kirkwood found himself in pos-
session of precisely one franc and
twenty centimes

  if only he had not been so anxious to
give calendar full value for his money

  as the boat drew out from the pier
mr hobbs was to be seen waving mr
kirkwood an ironic farewell and vio-
lently blowing kisses to miss calendar
from the tips of his soiled fingers

  at the first blush by turns indignant
and relieved to see the last of him kirk-
wood fell subsequently a prey to pro-
phetic terrors

  hobbss relinquishment of the chase
could mean but one thing-that far
from having left danger behind them on
the continent they were but flying to
encounter it beneath the smoky pall of
london

the coils tighten

  the westering sun striking down
through the drab exhalations of ten
thousand sooty chimneypots tinted the
atmosphere to the hue of copper

  ones gaze wandering purposely out
through the window recoiled repelled
by the endless dreary vista of the
surrey sides uncounted roofs or
probing instantaneously the depths of
some narrow thoroughfare fleetingly
disclosed as the evening boat-train swung
on level with the eaves of southwarks
dwellings was saddened by the knowl-
edge that such squalor could obtain and
flourish unrebuked

  for perhaps the tenth time kirkwood
turned to the girl with the question
ready-framed upon his lips

   are you quite sure- he began

and then conscious of the clear and
penetrating perception of the brown eyes
that smiled into his from beneath their
level brows stammered and left the sen-
tence uncompleted

  still regarding him steadily smiling
the girl shook her head in laughing re-
buke and denial

   do you know she asked him
 that that is about the fifth repetition
within the last quarter-hour of that ques-
tion 

   how do you know what i meant to
say  he demanded momentarily di-
verted

   i could see it in your eyes besides
youve talked of nothing else since we
left the boat wont you believe me
please when i tell you that  know ab-
solutely not a soul in london to whom
i could go and ask for shelter

   its only a little way farther mr
kirkwood to chiltern-an hours ride
and the pyrfords will be glad to have
me so you see by eight to-night youll
have off your hands the girl who has
been nothing but a drag and a worry to
you ever since-

   dont  he pleaded  please

  you know he told her with his
heart in his eyes  that it isnt that i
dont want you off my hands-that is to
say i-er-

  and he fell speechless aghast at the
enormity of his blunder

   i mean he said presently control-
ling his voice  that i should be glad to
go on serving you howsoever i might
until the end of time

  here he came to a full stop

    oh lord   he groaned  worse
and more of it why in thunder cant i
say the right thing right

  the problem absorbing him for the
time he hardly noticed that she made
 answer the train grinding and jolt-
ing to a halt before crossing the bridge
presently roused him

  she was staring thoughtfully out of
the window out over a billowing sea of
roofs and chimneys merging indefinitely
into haze long ere it reached the horizon
and he could see the warm color pulsing
in her throat and cheeks while the
glamour of the light that leaped and
died in her eyes as the ruddy sunlight
wanned them was a thing to live for and
die for

  so she had understood 

  suddenly she turned to him sweet
troubled serious

   dear mr kirkwood she said


the all-story magazine

gently leaning forward to read his
anxious countenance  wont you tell me
what it is that worries you so is it the
fear xtf my father dont you know that
he can do nothing now that we are safe
all we have to do is to jump in a cab
and drive over to paddington station

   you dont want to underestimate
the resource and ability of mr calen-
dar he told her gloomily  weve a

chance but no more it wasnt-

he shut up suddenly

   it wasnt that  she caught him up
then what is it you must tell me
vou know if it affects me

   it affects us both he said drearily
 i-i dont-

  and there again the wretched embar-
rassment of the confession struck him
dumb  only his eyes appealed to hers
mutely piteous

  the train began to move

   theres only a minute mote the
girl told him  surely you can tell
me

   its this he broke out exasperated
 im strapped i havent enough to pay
cab-fare across town to say nothing of
taking us to chiltern  havent enough
money to buy you a glass of water if you
were thirsty 

  dismay flickered in her eyes-dismay
and sympathy and all the emotions such
a confession should naturally rouse in
one who like dorothy calendar had
never given money a thought had never
known the want of a penny

   and she added presently in a
breathless awestruck tone  i havent a
farthing in the world i never even
thought of it poor mr kirkwood i
am so sorry let me see what can 
do  cant consent to be a burden
but youre not theres one thing
we can do of course she glanced at
him inquiringly  craven streets just
round the comer we can walk there

   yes -wonderingly

  to mrs-hallams home  mean
its too lale now-after five-else we
could deposit the jewels in a bank since
-since theyre no longer yours the only
thing to do is to get them in safety or
to the rightful owner if you place them
in young hallams hands yours will be
clear and- nevet did such a thing in
my life miss calendar but if lies got

a spark of gratitude in his make-up i
ought to be able to-er-borrow a pound

or two

  thundering and panting the train
drew in beneath the vast dome of the
great station kirkwood lifting out the
luggage turned on the platfonn and
gave the girl his hand

  she stepped quickly down to his side
and together they made their way with
the pushing throng down the platform
toward the ticket-wicket

  here there was congestion the pas-
sengers backing up before the wickets
waiting their turn over the serried
array of silk hats and  bowlers  on the
inner side of the fence kirkwood could
see its counterpart on the outside-out-
bound passengers awaiting their chance
to enter idle onlookers people expecting
friends was calendar there

  no other way existed for their egress
save through those revolving wickets if
calendar were there or stryker or mul-
ready or all three they could not escape
seeing the girl in kirkwoods company

  they ran the gauntlet of those hun-
dreds of eyes in fear and trembling the
sensation of relief when at length they
were without and none had approached
them was exquisite yet it were unwise
to linger

  if you dont mind hurrying miss
calendar 

  she nodded brightly to him her lips
firm eyes speculative thoughts pre-
empted with concern in another mo-
ment they were outside the building
undergoing the crtiss-fire of the assem-
bled cabbies

  it being the first time that he had
ever left the station afoot kirkwood
paused irresolutely casting about him
for the way to the strand and then ab-
ruptly caught the girl without ceremony
by the arm and hurried her toward the
step of a waiting hansom

   quick he told her in a single
breath  your father he hasnt seen
us yet glancing back over his shoulder
 strykers with him-getting out of a
cab

  and  oh the devil  cried the
panic-stricken young man to himself

  already the girl instant to grasp the
situation was seated in the hansom
kirkwood was lifting the second valise
chase of the gladstone bag



up to the floor and simultaneously keep-
ing an eye on calendars cab-halt the
length of th- station-front away

  the fat adventurers foot was leaving
the step as stryker the keen of vision
called to him

  calendar turned flushed with excite-
ment and the knowledge that his quarry
was at last in sight simultaneously he
pointed out the cab into which kirk-
wood was climbing shouting to his own
driver and laboriously made the more
awkward by his haste started to hoist
his heavy carcass back into the hansom

   to that delay alone did they owe their
temporary escape kirkwood snapping
the- craven street address to the cabby
with a plea for extreme haste was hard-
ly seated ere the hansom swung around
the gate-posts into the strand

   thats the comfort of london
commented kirkwood cheerfully seating
himself   the cabbies are so quick when
they expect a tip

  great heavens as he caught the
expression in the girls eyes  i never
thought

  his face lengthened and his eye-
brows twisted themselves askew

  now we are in for it he said
 well its trust to luck now and take
whats coming to us

   but the girl said nothing

  kirkwood turned in his seat craning
his neck to peer out of the small rear
window

    i dont see their cab he said  but
of course its after us they must have
been on watch at cannon street and
finding we didnt get of there-of
course hobbs wired them-took cab for
charing cross luckily for us or is
it he added doubtfully

  the hansom turned down craven
street mrs hallams house stood near
the northumberland avenue end long
ere they had reached it kirkwood was
poised upon the step ready to jump
once he looked back and saw another
hansom break through the pedestrians
at the strand crossing and leap into
rapid pursuit

  vet as they neared mrs hallams
residence the young man drew back with
a short exclamation of dismay the
house was shut tight to the street-
blinds drawn close at the windows the

area-gate padlocked an estate agents
board projecting from above the door-
way advertising the property to be
let

  dnve on kirkwood shouted to
the cabby  as fast as you can

   were to sir 

   you see that cab behind dont let
it catch up shake it off lose it some-
how and it will be worth your while
then ill tell you where to go

   right-o  cried the cabby entering
into the spirit of the game with grateful
zest

    shant let em catch yer sir

  glancing back and estimating the dis-
tance that separated the two vehicles he
lifted whip from socket and brought it
down smartly around his horses flanks
the hansom seemed to jump from the
ground it swung into northumberland
avenue and whirled into the embank-
ment on a single wheel

  kirkwood looked again they had
gained on the pursuer

   good   he applauded beneath his
breath

   how said the girl breathlessly-
 how do you dare 

  dare echoed kirkwood in his
veins the excitement was running like
fire id dare a sight more than this
for you dorothy 

   and have dared the girl amended
softly then added with such hesitation
as to seem almost timidly  philip

  the long lashes swept up from her
cheeks her brown eyes brave to encoun-
ter his

  but he was not looking manlike
rap with the ardor of the chase he
was llind and deaf and she saw that
he had not even heard and did not realize
that for the first time in their knowledge
of each other they had broken through
the rigid bounds of social convention

  she turned away placing an elbow on
the arm-rest and flattening one small
gloved hand against the frame bracing
herself against the jouncing of the ve-
hicle as it swept beside the tawny
breadth of the thames for the time
there was silence between them the while
she forgot self and her present peril
surrendering her being to the lingering
sweetness of her long long thoughts

  ive got a scheme kirkwood an-
the all-story magazine

nounced so suddenly that she felt as if
wrenched back to earth

  theres the pless they know me
there and my credits good when weve
shake themoff we can have the driver
take u there ill reg-ster and borrow
from the management enough to take us
out to chtltem and pay for a cable to
new york

   ive a friend or two there that
wouldnt let roe suffer for the want of
a few pounds so you see ha face
clearing  we re at the end of our trou-
bles already

  she said s-mething inaudible her face
averted he bent forward wondering

   i didnt hear he suggested

  still looking away  i said you were
very g xd to me she whispered with a
little quaver in her voice

   dorothy t 

  unconsciously his strong fingers fell
and closed upon the little hand that lay
beside him as unconsciously as he used
her name

   what is the matter 

  he leaned still farther forward peer-
ir into her face till glance me glance
at last ard his pulses tightened for sheer
wonder at the humid glory in her eyes

   dorothy child he said gently
dont worry so dear its all working
out-all working out

  quietly she freed her fingers

   i wasnt she said shakily in a tone
between laughter and tears  i was-
you wouldnt understand dont be
afraid i shall break down

   theres no reason he argued
 the cabby knows his business

  he seemed to the hansom racing
onward at the highest lawful rate of
speed swung from the embankment past
the houses of parliament and with the
abbey on hs left clattered over the cob-
bles of old palace yard and abingdon
street turning suddenly into the mare of
baekways great and mean that twine
and intertwine south of victoria-

  doubling and twisting sow this way
and now that the cabby tooled them
through tv maze leading the pursuers
surh a dance as kirkwood thought cal-
culated to lose them in two minutes yet
aiways through the little window the fol-
lowing hansom kept visible hanging
doggedly in the rear-a hundred vards

behind no more no less pelting after

with indomitable determination

  gradually the pair drew westward
through pimlico and into chelsea once
flashing briefly down grosvenor road by
the river-wall

  children cheered them on and bob-
bies turned to stare wondering should
they interfere the minutes lengthened
to tens into an hour and suil they kept
on hunted and hunters playing their
game of hide-and-seek through the high-
ways and byways of those staid old quar-
ters

  the sun was low behind the houses
on the surrey side when kirkwood no-
ticed that their horse was nagging
though not more so than the one be-
hind within the past hour they seemed
to have gained a hundred feet or so upon
their persecutors

  concerned the young man lifted an
arm thrusting open the trap

   you had better drive as directly as
you can for the hotel pless cabby he
said im afraid you cant keep this
up much longer

   im sure of it sir came the rough
voice from above  es a good oss sir
but e carat keep goin forever you know
sir

  i know agreed kirkwood
 youve done very well - youve
done your best

  two blocks farther on the speed had
become so sensibly diminished that he
became genuinely alarmed and behind
them the pursuing cabby was lashing his
horse

  while  it arent no use me whippin
im sir came through the trap  es
doin orl e can

   i know

  desperation tightened kirkwoods lips
and fired a glitter in his eye he bent
forward and lifted to his knees the girls
traveling-bag in which the gladstone was
concealed

   what are you going to do   asked
the girl voice a tremble

   take a chancc-the last chance
youll stand by me  

   km know she told him

   then- kirkwood stood op

  they were traversing a street in old
brompton-a quaint old street lined with
houses curiously old-worldish even for
chase of the 

london house with sloping roofs
gables old dormer-windows their -ccl
brick facades trimmed with green shut-
ters and stoops cf white stone scrubbed
a shining white each owning a trim door-
yard fenced off from the sidewalk

  fheir numbers dropped past-shiny
brass plates set in the door-panels

     now kirk-
wood was twenty-five years of age as has
been said

   cabby he cried over the roof of the
hansom  put us down at number twenty-
five and wait-will you please 

   very good sir

  kirkwood turned to meet the girls
wondering eyes

   as soon as the cab stops please he
said significantly

  she nodded blankly

  he waited poised with a foot on the
step he wondered how insane he would
consider this contemplated proceeding in
a quieter moment

  the hansom pulled in sharply at the
curb its pursuer half a block away
kirkwood jumped down with the bag
be sure and gave a hand to the girl
who leaped lightly to his side

   come  he told her briefly nodding
to the cabman and hurried her through
the gate of number twenty-five and up the
short flagged walk then on the spot-
less white stoop rang the bell and
emphasized his haste by pealing a thun-
derous summons on the knocker

  behind their waiting hansom the sec-
ond cab drew in and calendar could be
seen lifting himself ponderously out of it

  kirkwoods fingers itched for the
knocker he had lifted his hand when
the door opened and on the threshold he
leheld not the butler or the smart white-
capped maid that he had thought to see
but the figure of a man evidently the
head of the house at a glance a tallish
man slender with a thin pink face a
white mustache and shrewd kindly eyes
gleaming somewhat wistfully behind his
glasses

   i beg your pardon volunteered
kirkwood hastily as the inquiring gaze
fell upon him   but may i beg five min-
utes of your time-at once 

  the shadow of a smile appeared on
ihe thin straight lips the keen eyes
ranged from his face to the waiting cab

ladstone bag	

 to calendar dropping hastily to the side-
 walk to the face of the girl at kirk-
 woods side

    the thin lids drooped a trifle

    wont you come in  said the house-
 holder

   kirkwood stood aside giving way to
 the girl smiling a confidence intoher
 eyes which it must be confessed he did
 not himse feel under its spell her
 momentary hesitation vanished  trusting
 submissive she bowed a little distant bow
 to the strange and entered the hallway

   as kirkwood followed her the house-
 holder stepped past him to the door-
 stoop calendar was at the gate his fat
 fingers fumbling with the latch his
 round red face dark with wrath

   do you wish tc see me inquired
 die householder mildly peering over his
 spectacles

   calendar paused with his hand on the
 gate

    i want my daughter he vociferated
 loudly

   the strangers gaze veered to kirk-
 woods face lingered momentarily on the
 young mans honest eyes and returned to
 calendar

    my dear sir he said in the same
 mild tone  will you be kind enough to
 take yourself off-tc the devil if you
 like or shall i call in the police

   the fat adventurer thunderstruck
 halted on the path then swung and
 looked in the direction indicated  -jje
 householders gestures

   a blue-coated limb of the law was at
 the instant advancing with measured
 stride from the nearer comer

   calendars mouth opened and closed
 his moon-like countenance was still fur-
 ther eclipsed by the shadow of his dis-
 concertment abruptly he turned and
 made off banging the gate behind him

   the stranger watched him for a mo-
 ment  then with the least of miles
 turned and waved the overwhelmed
 american into his house

chapter xxii

the amateur adventurer

   di mkoi nded kirkwood preceded his
 host through the hall to a small book-
 lined library in the rear of the house


the all-story magazine

  here a fire burned crackling happily
in a grate both wide and deep and a
shaded reading-lamp diffused its pleasant
homely glow upon the surface of a table
littered with magazines and books in
the air there swam a fine aroma of good
tobacco the fumes from a half-consumed
cigar drifting in thin blue reefs in the
lamplight

   at the fireplace one small foot on the
brassy fender dorothy stood looking
down the sensitive sweetness of her face
illumined and enhanced by the rich rud-
dy glow upflung from the bedded coals

   one entered tliis room as into a haven
of peace

  beyond the threshold as the girl
looked up kirkwood turned to face
his host candidly yet a trace nervously
ere he could speak however the other
gave him pause with a white and fragile
hand asking for attention

   sir said the owner of the hand
somewhat austerely  permit me to put
one question have you by any chance
paid your cabby 

  the younger man blushed painfully
the other quietly laid his hand upon a
bell-pull a faint jingle was audible in
the depths of the house

   how much should you say vou owe
him

   i have not a penny in the world
said kirkwood courageously as his host
thrusting a hand into his pocket with-
drew it filled with coin

  the shrewd eves flickered amusement
into his

   tut tut  with a chuckle  be-
tween gentlemen my dear sir how
much did you say  

   ten shillings-or twelve would be
nearer right stammered kirkwood
wretchedly divided between gratitude
and profound amazement

  at this moment a short and paunchy
butler appeared haughtily in the door

   hi master quietly selected a half-sov-
ereign and a half-crown from his hand-
ful and gave them to the servant  for
the cabby wot ton

   yessir the butler swung precise-
ly on his heel

  and wotton

    yessir  

  if any one should ask for me i am
not at home

   yessir

  the butler vanished a moment later
they heard him close the front door as he
went out

  his host turned from kirkwood tub-
bing his hands

   my dear he said addressing the
girl- i am old enough to call you my
dear without offense i trust-wont you
take this chair and make yourself more
comfortable 

  she rewarded him with a radiant
smile whereupon their host strode to
the fire turned his back to it and
clasped his hands behind him glower-
ing at kirkwood over his glasses

   ah  he commented in a tone of ex-
treme personal satisfaction  romance
romance 

   would you mind telling me how you
knew  had not paid my cabby sir   in-
quired kirkwood anxiously as yet not
half recovered from his stupefaction

   simply enough my dear sir i pos-
sess an imagination from my bedroom
window i behold two cabs racing down
the street the one madly pursuing the
other the foremost draws up at my
carriage-block alights therefrom a gen-
tleman looking if youll pardon me un-
commonly seedy followed by a young
lady if she will pardon me with a
little bow  uncommonly pretty

   with these two old eyes i observe
that the gentleman does not pay the cab-
by on the other hand he brings his
traveling-bag to my door which argues
that he purposes making me a visit of
some length in which case he certainly
should not keep a cabby waiting was i
justified 

   unfortunately assented kirkwood
 you were

  and grinned enchanted with the
charming consideration shown them by
their host

   so so  assented the gentleman
 so the world wags to the old tune
and i who in my youth pursued adven-
ture without success in my old age find
myself dragged into a romance by my
two ears whether i will or no eh  and
now you are going to tell me all about it
there is a chair mr-er 

   my name is kirkwood-philip kirk-
wood

   permit me to introduce myself as
chase of the gladstone bag



brentwick - arthur brentwick and
you my dear  

   i am dorothy calendar

  mr brentwick removed his glasses
rubbed them and blinked thoughtfully
at the girl

   my dear he said suddenly  you
look remarkably like your mother lut
i should know i was one of her most
ardent admirers but that can wait

  he replaced his glasses waved kirk-
wood peremptorily to a chair and rubbed
his hands

   now my dear sir for the adven-
ture  

   but how do you know-

  how can it be otherwise with a
trace of asperity  am i to be denied
my adventure i refuse sir unequivo-
cally your very bearing breathes of
romance if there be no adventure forth-
coming i regret to say that my disap-
pointment is so acute that i must show
you the door

    sir  cried kirkwood rising on his
dignity

  sit down barked mr brentwick
so abruptly that the young man obeyed
out of sheer astonishment upon which
his host advanced and menaced him with
a long white forefinger

   would you sir he demanded
 again expose this little lady to the
machinations of that corpulent scoundrel
whom i have just had the pleasure of
shooing off my premises because you
choose to resent an old mans raillery
for shame mr kirkwood 

    i am sorry sir said the young man
humbly

    you are right to be sir if the storys
long epitomize we can have the de-
tails later if your case be extreme

    briefly then said kirkwood halt-
ingly  the man who followed us to your
door is miss calendars father

   ah

   fie is pursuing us mr brentwick
with the intention of obtaining some
property to which he has no right and
which we are trying to return to its own-
ers

   my dear  said mr brentwick gen-
tly looking down at the girls flushed and
drooping head

   i continued kirkwood  am penni-
less to-day ive spent my last farthing

if i can cable to new york i can get a
few pounds from my personal friends
and repay you mr brentwick i came
to your door by accident-it might as
well have been another i ask your gen-
erosity the shelter of your roof for a
while on miss- calendars behalf it is
necessary that she should reach chiltern
this evening where she has friends who
will receive her and protect her will
you aid us 

   hmtn grumbled mr brentwick
meditatively

   my faith he commented his face
brightening  its almost too good to
be true and  had been afraid the
world was getting to be a humdrum
place my dear to the girl  what
mr kirkwood tells me is quite-er-

  the girl lifted her chin a trace resent-
fully

   whatever mr kirkwood tells you
sir could be nothing else she returned
simply  but im sure you do not
doubt-

   doubt my faith no my dear
doubr  he snorted indignantly  this
is altogether too fine to be doubted
what is it wotton 

  the butler had appeared silently in
the doorway  beg pardon sir the gen-
tlemans valise sir left in the cab
sir

   you may put it down wotton and
wotton dont you think you need a
breath of air 

   yessir thank you sir assented the
man readily

   then you may change your coat
wotton and light your pipe and stroll
out for a quarter of an hour and if
you should see a tall thin gentleman with
a seafaring air you see i have quick
eyes mr kirkwood or a short stout
gentleman with an air of mystery taking
an interest in these premises you might
make a note of it wotton

    yessir

   and if one of the gentlemen or
both should annoy you with conver-
sation wotton you will be careful not
to tell them anything in particular al-
though i authorize you to inform them
that mr brentwick lives here if they
ask

   yessir thank you sir

 asd thal concluded kirkwood
losing up from his savory meal   all
l alr interrupted the girl warmly
from her seat cn the opposite side of the
table  but what yes havent told

u and that my dear is due wholly tc

a very creditable modesty sasd brent-
wick

he leaned hack in his chair wming
to listen to a commun katkm murmured

at his ear in- the butler

  kirkwoods eyes met the girls across
the breadth of shining linen and be
grinned whimsically slaking his bead in
plaintive deprecation

   really yon mustnt he turfd her in
an undertone   dont deserve in

  bet her gaae held his  and presently
he locked down abashed strangely con-
scious c-f his anworthihess-

  cr nee was set before them by wotton
the cat-footed breatwkk refusing it
with a little sigh

   it is one of the things denied me by
the physician who makes his life happy
by making mine a desert waste he said
 i am permitted im three inxnries-
cigars my books and the privilege of im-
p -sing on my friends the frst i propose
presently to enjoy the second holds no
attraction for me this night the third i
have jns availed myself of

  he rested his head against the chair-
back glancing from face to face of the
two young people at his board

   inspiration to do the which he said
 came to me frc-m the seafaring man
stryker did yon say his name was - via
wottnn

   while yon were preparing for din-
ner my servant returned from his consti-
tutional with tbe news that leaving the
corpulent person cm duty a the comer
mr stryker had temporarily vanished
but only to reappear in good time and a
motor-car it becomes evident that yon
have not overrated their determination
the fas of the cab-chase is not to be re-
peated

  the girl resolutely suppressed a little
gasp  dismay kirkwood regarded his
cap somberly

   and so continued breiiwick  
bethought me of a count-erstr he it is
my h-bor to -mi a friend owns 
touring-car accordingly i telephoned
him and borrowed it-mechanic and all
i am willing blindly to risk a few pence
cn the belief that it will prove consider-
ably faster than the machine captain
stryker was able to hire

 i propose then he concluded sit-
chase of the gladstone bag



ting forward and lacing his long white
lingers -i that we avoid the perils of cab
and railway-carriage and proceed to
chiltern by motor miss calendar have
you any objection 

  the girl looked to kirkwood

    have none she said quietly

   and you sir 

   you are very thought lul said kirk-
wood  i cant think of anything better
calculated to throw them off the trail
than to distance them by motor it would
be always easy to trace our route by rail

   then said their host making as if
to rise  we had best go if my ears-or
captain strykers car-does not deceive
me our fiery chariot is panting at the
curb

  they rose a little sobered from the
gaiety with which they had dined brent-
wicks house had been to them a tower of
refuge in time of stress now they were
to go forth again to dare the pitfalls of
calendar the ingenious and purposeful

  not that either greatly feared the out-
come but there is always room for error
in human calculations calendars had
already proved fallible within the
bounds of possibility their turn to stum-
ble might now be at hand

  when he dwelt upon it their sneer im-
potency to stay calendar by ordinary
methods bade fair to madden kirkwood
with any other man it had been so sim-
ple a matter to put a period to his career
by a word to a policeman but in this case
it was dorothys hands that had stolen
the jewels innocently though she had
committed the larceny a catspaw a tool
in the hands of an intelligence malign
and unscrupulous the law would not
hold her guiltless were she once brought
within its cognizance nor would the
hallams

  upon their knowledge and fear of
this calendar was calculating  witness
the boldness with which he was operating
his fear of the police was genuine
enough but he was never for a moment
troubled by apprehensions of his daugh-
ter turning against him she would not
dare

  before they left the house kirkwood
recounoitered from the drawing-room
windows at the carriage-block their
motor-car rested humming contentedly
at the corner a smaller car stood in wait-

    	s

ing its lamps glaring balefully through
the night

  opposite the house a figure-strykers
-lurked in the shadows otherwise the
street was deserted not even the provi-
dential bobby of the early evening was in
evidence

  wotton outwardly immobile and
nerveless let them out by the front door
shutting it so abruptly behind them as
to give rise to the suspicion that beneath
his icy exterior he feared desperately that
the house might be stormed by tlie ad-
venturers

  kirkwood to the right brentwick to
the left of the girl each carrying one of
the valises they hastened down the path
through the gate and into the car
brentwick taking-the front seat by the
mechanic-a dark shape in goggles and a
touring-coat that shone like an oilskin-
left the tonneau to kirkwood and the
girl

  a near-by street-lamp made all this
clearly visible to the watcher across the
way

  as kirkwood slammed shut the ton-
neau-door and the car began to move
stryker whistled shrilly and the other car
swept up the street slowing down to let
him jump aboard

  then it fell in at the rear attempting
no greater speed than was necessary to
keep the leading car in sight calen-
dars design to leave them no instants
freedom from observation was obvious
he purposed keeping forever at their el-
bow waiting his chance waiting the mo-
ment when wearied their vigilance
should relax

  to some extent he had reckoned with-
out his motor-car as long as they were
within the city limits compelled to main-
tain a decorous pace in deference to the
prejudices of the london city council
it was an easy matter to trail the motor-
car that bore the jewels

 but once they had swung north
through kensington to shepherd s bush
and down the uxbridge road paced by
flying trams through hammersmith to
southall the complexion of the business-
was changed-for the worse as t aleridar
viewed it

  the scattered lights of southall drop-
ping behind them brentwick spoke a low-
toned word to the mechanic


the all-story magazine



   silently the latter opened out the throt-
tle  the motor lilted merrily into its song
of the open road its deep and silken
humming altered with startling sudden-
ness to a resounding purr a mile of
highway hail been flung behind almost
ere they had time to catch their breath
and another and another miles piling
upon miles the wide darkling country-
side opening out before them free and
clean

  a lurch threw the girl against
kirkwood and she caught at his arm to
save herself very gently he took her
hand passed it beneath his arm and
closed his fingers over it perhaps the
wildness of this dash through the night
the sonorous roar of the motor the buf-
feting of the night-wind violent in her
face rendered her a thought forget-
ful  she made no move as if to draw
away

  when he looked down into the face so
near to his she smiled contentedly up into
his eyes and the perilous sweetness of
lips and eyes that were shown him by
the light of the far shining stars tempted
him almost beyond his strength

  yet this was not the time time enough
when he had gone back to his place-or
rather when he should have found it-
in the ranks of the wage-earners and so
proved his right to happiness to lay what
he had to offer at her feet

  so he turned his face forward half
dreaming half planning against the
struggle that was to make his future
thus they rode at length free contented
in the knowledge that safety lay before
them that they were with friends that
their persecutors labored unavailing
far behind them striving to compass the
impossible-the impossible that is bar-
ring the intervention of the unforeseen

  llalf an hour of this then kirkwood
began to be conscious that their speed
was slackening he could hear the me-
chanics voice grumbling as he fussed
with the driving-gear  he heard brent-
wick fling him a sharp-toned query get a
reply as short

  and steadily the speed decreased until
at length they were moving scarcely
faster than a cab had carried them snail-
like to their former pace

  brent wick leaned bark over the ton-
neau

   trouble he announced briefly  im
afraid weve blundered

   what is it  inquired the girl bend-
ing forward

   petrols giving out charles here
says that the tank must have leaked
well do the best we can and stop at the
first inn  a majority of the inns maintain
stores of petrol for just such emergencies
now

   are we-do you think- kirk-
wood put in

  oh not a bit of it i theyll not
catch up with us this night thats a
poor car they have-nothing to compare
with this my dear sir well reach the
crown and mitre just ahead tank up
and be off long before they make up hall
what theyve lost

  dorothy looked anxiously at kirk-
wood  her lips forming the inaudible
query what did he think

   oh well have no trouble he as-
sured her  the chauffeur knows un-
doubtedly

  nevertheless he stood up in the ton-
neau the traveling-bag beneath his feet
conscious of the revolver weighing heav-
ily in his pocket and stared back along
the road there was absolutely nothing
visible

  the car continued to crawl some five
minutes elapsed gradually they drew
abreast a roadside tavern standing a little
back from the road embowered in trees
the lights of its tap-room and parlor
glowing invitingly between their trunks
a creaking sign on a post by the roadside
informed all and sundry that here was
the crown and mitre ready to furnish
entertainment for man and beast

  the car stopped

  charles the mechanic jumped out and
ran up the path toward the inn brent-
wick turned again his eyes shining in the
starlight his brow quaintly furrowed his
voice apologetic

   it may take a few moments he said
plainly endeavoring to hide his concern
 my dear if i have brought trouble to
you i shall never earn my own forgive-
ness

  kirkwood stood up again watchful
listening

   i hear nothing he said

   you will forgive me wont you my
dear for causing you these few anxious
chase of the gladstone bag



moments pleaded the old gentleman
his tone tremulous

   as if you could be blamed  pro-
tested the girl  you must not think of
it that way fancy what should we
have done without you 

   mr kirkwood do you hear any-
thing  

   nothing as yet sir responded the
young man

   perhaps said brentwick -i we had
best alight and go up to the inn it
would be more comfortable there
especially if the petrol proves hard to
procure and we have long to wait

   i should like to very much said the
girl

 kirkwood nodded approval and
opened the door stepping out to assist
her then he picked up the bag and
followed the pair

  brentwick had gallantly offered his
arm and she had accepted it as readily

  charles met them in the doorway ap-
parently vexed

  no petrol to be had here sir he said
touching the vizor of his cap  they are
going to send a mile up the road for
some you will have to be patient im
afraid sir

  kirkwood paused again listening at-
tentively before he entered but the
wind was blowing in the direction from
which they had come and he heard
naught but the sighing of it in the trees
and an echo of rustic laughter from the
tap-room

  a red-cheeked landlady bowed and
scraped before them until they had en-
tered a private parlor then departed in
search of light refreshments ordered by
brentwick

  the girl seated herself upon a couch
and made a palpable attempt to appear
at ease brentwick stood by the window
tall figure bent hands clasped behind his
back as he peered out into the night
kirkwood dropped the valise beneath a
chair and took to pacing the floor

  the minutes lagged sluggishly ticked
oil by the pendulum of the tall grand-
fathers clock in the corner the land-
lady did not reappear for some reason
unconscionably delayed brentwick re-
marked upon the fact querulously then
abruptly turned away from the window
and drew a chair up bv the table

   we must not permit ourselves to be
worried he said with a thin smile

 my dear wont you sit here and
mr kirkwood will you bring up your
chair i have something to show you
that may perhaps engage vour interestfor
a while

  to humor him and alleviate his ap-
parent distress they acceded kirkwood
seating himself opposite the girl with
brentwick between them the latter
with some hesitation thrust a hand into
an inner coat-pocket and produced a
small black-leather wallet fie seemed
about to open it then suddenly laid it
upon the table as steps approached the
room

   charles burst in leaving the door wide 

  mr brentwick sir he panted

 that car-

  kirkwood leaped to his feet tugging at
the weapon in his pocket

  in another breath he had the revolver
exposed the girl uttered a little low
cry sitting very still brentwick with a
sharp exclamation turned upon kirk-
wood and clamping strong supple fin-
gers upon the younger mans wrist with
the other hand laid hold of the re-
volver and by a single twist wrenched
it away

  kirkwood turned upon him furiously

   so  he cried his voice vibrant

 this is what your hospitality meant  i
might have known-

   my dear sir retorted mr brent-
wick with a flash of impatience  had i
desired to betray you i would have asked
no better opportunity than when you
were in my own house 

   but- expostulated kirkwood

trembling as heavy footsteps drummed
the tempo of haste in the hallway

  	would you have bullets flying when
this young lady is about demanded
brentwick

  he slid the revolver hurriedly upon
a shelf beneath the table-top

   sir  lie told kirkwood with heat

 you are a young fool  was once too
-and would to heaven i were again
take my advice and he calm-its the
only way to save your treasure 

  hang the jewels cried kirkwood
hotly

  sir who said anything about the
jewels -as indignantly


the all-story magazine

  at that moment calendar appeared in
the doorway strykers weather-beaten
countenance leering over his shoulder

chapter xxiv

mr calendar and care positively
their farewell appearance

  the fat adventurer hung momentarily
on the threshold quick eyes taking in the
four within the crown and mitre parlor
a shade of satisfaction colored his ex-
pression he smiled wickedly into the
close short thatch of his gray mustache
and held his revolver poised for instant
use

  but there was no necessity breut-
wick and kirkwood had resumed their
seats the girl had not stirred from
hers from the first alarm she was lean-
ing f t-vard elbows on table hands tight-
ly clasped her face-a little blanched-
turning toward the doorway her lips
were set and white with courage and the
brown eyes met calendar s in a level and
unflinching glance beyond this she
made no sign of recognition

  charles the mechanic stood nearest
the adventurers rigid in frightened as-
tonishment

  calendar advancing suddenly poked
at him with the revolver

   get back four-eyes he snapped
 get cut of my way 

  and the mechanic jumped as if shot
then hastily retreated to the table his
features working beneath the goggle-
mask that had excited calendars de-
rision

   come in cap n calendar threw
over his shoulder  come in close the
door and lock it 

  the captain obeyed grimacing mock-
ingly at kirkwood calendar advanced
jauntily to within a yard of the table
then stopped smiling complacently down
upon the little party lie had trapped and
twirling his revolver airily-

 good evening he gave them bland-

ly

   dorothy my child with assumed
concern  you are looking a trifle pale
im afraid youve been keeping late
hours

 mr kirkwood its delightful to see
you again permit me to remind you that

pistol-shots are apt to attract atten-
tc n it wouldnt be wise for voj to bring
the police about our ears  itelieve those
were your words to me in the cabin of the
alethea  were they not 

   and you sir staring hard at brent-
wick you animated fossil what dye
mean by telling me to go to the devil
but let that pass i forgive you what
might your name be 

   brentwick said that gentleman pla-
cidly

  he seemed about to say something
more but held his tongue smiling

   brentwick eh im charmed to meet
you im sure but permit me to advise
you not to come a second time between a
father and his daughter another man
might not be so patient with you i heres
a law in the land mr brentwick 

   it thoughtful of you not to go to
law observed brentwick quietly

hen with a change of note
come sir you have unwarrantably in-
vaded this room which i have engaged
get through with your business and be
off with yon 

  l eh whats that my antediluvian
friend oh all in my good - time
ahen ive concluded my business with
you ill go-not before but now well
get down to it mr kirkwood you have
a revolver belonging to me kindly re-
turn it

   its under the table interposed
brentwick suavely  shall i hand  to
you  

   by the muzzle if you please be
very careful-mines loaded toe apt to
go off at any moment

  brentwick to kirkwoods intense dis-
gust quietly slipped a hand underneath
the table and placing the revolver on its
top gently shoved it over to the farther
edge calendar with a satisfied grunt
dropped the weapon in his pocket

  any more he demanded sharply
eyes flitting alertly from face to face
 well yon wouldnt dare use them any-
way and im about through with you
dorothy my child its high time you re-
turned to your fathers protection where
is that gladstone bag  

   in my traveling-bag she told him
in even expressionless accents

   then bring it along vou may say
good night to the gentlemen
chase of the gladstone bag



  the girl did not move her pallor grew
slightly more intense her lips seemed a
trace more straight and firm

   dorothy  cried the adventurer
sharply  do you hear me 

    i hear you she replied a little wear-
ily

   never mind please mr kirk-
wood   with a little appealing gesture
 dont say anything i am not going
with this man

  calendars features worked nervously
he chewed at the corner of his mustache
eying the girl angrily

   i presume he said presently con-
trolling his emotion  that you are aware
that i as your parent am in a position to
remove you forcibly if you refuse to re-
turn to me

   i shall not go with you iterated the
girl calmly  whether by force or no
if i go to prison-with you-in penalty
lor resisting i shall not go mr brent-
wick and mr kirkwood are taking me to
-some friends of mine where i will be
comfortable that is all i have to say to
you

  bravo my dear brentwick ap-
plauded in an aside which did not escape
calendar

  mind your own business sir he
thundered his face purple with fury

  then more steadily to his daughter
 you understand of course what this
means i offer you a home and a good
one if you refuse it you work for your
liviug my girl youve forfeited the
burgoyne legacy

   i know i know she said con-
temptuously i am content wont
you please to leave me alone 

  for an instant calendar glowered over
her

    i presume he said acidly  that all
these heroics are inspired by this whip-
per-snapper kirkwood do ycu know
that he hasnt a brass farthing to his
name 

   what has that- cried the girl

indignantly

   why its everything to do with it
my child you cant marry on nothing a
year for i surmise that you propose to
marry this kirkwood dont you 

  there followed a little interval of si-
lence while the hot blood flamed in the
girls face and the red lips quivered as

she faced her tormentor then with a
break in her voice that escaped her con-
trol 

   if mr kirkwood asks me i shall
she said very quietly

   that kirkwood interposed  is un-
derstood

  his gaze sought her face but she
would not look toward him

  calendar loomed above them trem-
bling with anger

   you dont seem to take into consider-
ation the fact that im your father and
you a minor lie told them bitingly  i
can refuse my consent

   but you wont said kirkwood eas-
ily

   no agreed the adventurer after an
instants hesitation

   no i shant interfere take her
my boy if you want her he added iron-
ically  the lord knows ive troubles
enough-a fathers lot is not an easy
one he paused sardonic sneering

   but he continued deliberately
 theres this little matter of the glad-
stone bag i am ready to abandon my

paternal authority but my property-

   it is not your property interrupted
the girl

   it was your mothers my child it
is now mine

   i question that kirkwood put in

   you may question what you like
calendar told him undisturbed  the
fact remains that i propose to remove my
property when i go whether you like it
or not are you going to raise any se-
rious objection or may  count on your
being sensible

  you may put up your revolver if
thats what you mean said kirkwood
 we shall certainly not oppose you with
violence but i warn vou that scotland

yard-

   oh that be blowed  snorted the ad-
venturer in disgust  i can sail circles
round any beak that ever blew out of
scotland yard you can give me an
hours stan and you can do all the busi-
ness you want to with-scotland yard 
 then you acknowledge said brent-
wick suavely-the old gentleman had
been a quietly intereted spectator
through it ail- that youve no legal
title to the jewels

   look here m friend chuckled the
adventurer complacently  when you
catch me acknowledging anything you
make a note of it and tell a bobby just
at present ive got something better to
do than go bout making acknowledg-
ments stryker hand me that teg ol my
dutiful daughters

    ere you are said the captain lift-
ing the valise from beneath the chair and
depositing it on the table before kirk-
wood

   we dont take anything that doesnt
belong to us laughed calendar fum-
bling with the catch  not even when its
so small a matter as my own childs trav-
eling-bag

   a small heavy black gladstone bag
he added opening the valise and plung-
ing liis hand in  will just about do for
me

  he drew the jewel-satchel out and set
it the table

   ake this away stryker he
chuckled mirthfully pushing the girls
valise aside and stood rumbling with
stentorian laughter beaming benignantly
around at the assembled company

   why he exclaimed  this is worth
all the trouble it has cost me my chil-
dren i forgive you freely mr kirk-
wood i congratulate you on having
secured a most expensive wife for a starve-
ling painter really  dont know but
what i ought to do something for you
both

  he gurgled delightedly rubbing his
fat mottled palms together

   i tell you what he resumed  no
one yet ever accused georgie calendar of
being mean im just going to make you
a handsome wedding-present

   the good lord knows he mumbled
 that theres enough here for a fellow
to throw a little something away and
never miss it

  the thick red fingers tore at the catch
nervously and finally got the bag
opened flicse about the table bent for-
ward themselves a little warmed by ex-
citement over the prospect of for the first
time beholding that for which they had
fought and suffered so long

  a heavy and luscious fragrance per-
vaded the atmosphere exhaled from the
open mouth of the gladstone bag

  a tense silence made itself felt by
those in the room-a breathless pause

broken at length by  -harp snap of cal-
endars white teeth

  m-m-m he grunted heavily and
began to pant

  abruptly his heavy hands began to dig
into the contents of the bag as a terrier
digs into the ground the air seemed
momentarily thick with flying objects

  beneath kirkwoods astonished eyes a
towel fell upon the table-a towel bear-
ing on its dingy hem the inscription in
poor chirography and indelible ink
 hotel du commerce anvers

 a heavy earthenware tooth-mug
dropped to the floor with a crash a
slimy soap-dish slid across the table-top
and into brentwicks lap

  a battered alarm-clock with not a tick
left in its abused carcass rang vacuously
as it fell beside the bag the rest was
oranges-a dozen or more small round
golden globes of ripe fruit perhaps a
trifle overripe and therefore the more
aromatic	-

  suddenly calendar ripped out an oath
 mulready by the living god  he
cried furiously  tricked by that infer-
nal blackguard me-blind as a bat
thats why he bought those damned
oranges is it thats why he was so
bent on picking a fight with me on the
boat hey

   and thats why lie was so knocked cut
he couldnt help me hunt you two blessed
idiots down eh well-by-the-eter-
nal  ill camp on his trail for the rest
of his natural-born days ill have his
hearts blood for this 

  he swayed gibbering in his rage his
face shockingly congested his fat hands
shaking as with ague on the rim of the
gladstone bag 	

  and suddenly while still their own as-
tonishment held kirkwood and the girl
speechless charles the mechanic with
a swift movement bent forward over the
valise

  kirkwood heard two metallic clicks
so close together that they sounded as
one

  calendars ravings were shut off as if
his tongue had become paralyzed he
dropped hack a step flabby jowls pale
and shaking heavy jaw drooping on his
breast mouth wide and eyes protruding
as he clashed before him his thick fleshy
wrists-securely handcuffed
chase of the gladstone bag



  instantly the mechanic whirled about
bounded across the floor and caught
stryker at the door his quick fingers
twisting in the mans coat-collar as he
yanked him back and threw him

   mr kirkwood  cried the mechanic
 here-one moment take that gun
away from this man will you 

  kirkwood sprang to his assistance and
without difficulty or indeed encounter-
ing great resistance wrested a revolver
from the captains limp trembling fin-
gers

  roughly the mechanic shook the man
dragging him to his feet once more

   now he said sternly  you go over
there in the corner and turn your face to
the wall and be good you cant get
away anyway ive got men watching
fer you outside

  stryker trembling like a whipped cur
meekly obeyed his instructions to the
letter

   charles turning away from him
with a contemptuous laugh strode back
to calendar at the same time removing
his goggles and clapped a heavy hand
upon the adventurers quivering shoul-
ders

  well he cried heartily still
sailing circles round scotland yard sim-
mons or cartwright or bellows or san-
derson or calendar or crumbstone-or
whatever name you prefer to be known
by 

 calendar glared at him aghast

  then heaved a heavy sigh shrugged
his fat shoulders in resignation and
dropped his head in thought abruptly
he looked up

   you cant do it he told the de-
tective violently  youve got not one
atom of proof against me whats there
-a pile of oranges and a peck of trash
besides if you take me in youll have to
take that girl too for i swear she did the
stealing  ill not be trapped this way
through her and let her go on her way re-
joicing if you take me-take her dye
hear

   i think put in the clear bland
voice of mr brentwick that we can
consider that matter settled

   here he said picking up the wallet
in which he had asserted kirkwood and
the girl would find something to interest
them  here is a little matter that may

clear up any lingering doubts that you
may entertain

  he extracted a slip of cardboard and
gently shoved it across the table calen-
dar bewildered bent over it for a mo-
ment then straightened up shook him-
self laughed uneasily and turned to the
detective

   its come with you i suppose he
said

   the remsen warrant is still out for
you returned the man  thatll be
good enough to hold you on

   oh all right ill come peaceably
i guess said mr calendar thoughtful-
ly jingling the manacles  im a back
number anyway its up to me to quit
and live at the countrys expense for the
rest of my days when a half-grown girl
a half-baked artist a flub like mulready
and a club-footed snipe from scotland
yard can put it all over me this way

   yep he sighed  time to quit but
i would like to get in one good lick at
that blackguard mulready 

   dont worry about him advised the
detective  we got a wire from the am-
sterdam police this afternoon saying that
theyd picked up mr mulready and a
woman named hallam on suspicion
they were opening negotiations for the
sale of a lot of stones and seemed in
such a precious hurry that the diamond
merchants suspicions were aroused
there was a kid named frederick hallam
at their hotel and theyve got him under
surveillance too

  amen grunted calendar im
blame glad to hear it twouldnt be a
square deal otherwise

  he turned nodded uncertainly to the
girl kirkwood and brentwick then
with the detectives hand under his arm
and accompanied by the thoroughly
cowed stryker waddled awkwardly out
of the room

  kirkwood following the trio to the
door shut it carefully and returned slow-
ly to the table

  the girl had hardly moved save to
place elbows on the dark polished mahog-
any slab and cradle her cheeks between
hands still clenched

  the color had returned to her face
with a little enhanced depth of hue to
be credited to her excitement her
checks were hot her eyes starlike beneath
the- woven massy sunlight of her hair
and she stared steadfastly before her
temporarily unconscious of her surround-
ings thoughts astray and sounding the
iridescent depths of the dreamlike days
to come 

  brentwick had slid forward in his
chair resting his white head on its
back and was smiling serenely up at
the low yellow ceiling presently he
roused caught kirkwoods eye and
smiled the young man grinned

   and you did all that  he comment-
ed amused

   brentwick nodded self-satisfied

    r contrived it all said he  rather
neat i call it too his eyes brightened
youthfully with the light of pleasure

  inspiration he cried inspira-
tion pure and simple id been nagging
my brain for fully five minutes before
wotton told me about their engaging a
motor-car and then in a flash i had it
you see i happened to know charles-
his name by the way is really charles-
and  telephoned scotland yard and ar-
ranged all the details with him

  he chuckled with delight

     its the instinct  he told kirkwood
emphatically- the instinct for adven-
ture i knew i had it but never until this
day did it have a chance to prove its ex-
istence

   a born adventurer-thats what i
am he crowed you see we had to
get them to believe that we were afraid
and running away then theyd run after
us  might have baited a dozen traps
and failed to lure them into my house
after that stout scoundrel knew you had
had time to tell me the whole story the
minute you mentioned the name of cal-
endar  began to understand odd  
he lapsed suddenly into reverie the
wistful whimsical look coming back into
his eves replacing the glow of excite-
ment and he sighed faintly

   what i dont understand said
kirkwood shaking his head  is how you
forced calendar to withdraw his charge
against dorothy here

  oh-h mr brentwick elevated his
fine white eyebrows smiled again and
sat up

     i can answer you best perhaps said
he  by asking you to scan what  sub-

mitted to his respectful consideration my
dear sir

  and he delicately thrust the slip of
cardboard toward kirkwood it proved
an ordinary oblong of cream-colored
paper engraved in fine script simply a
visiting-card something like the follow-
ing

  mr george burgoyne calendar

                     asptn gardens s w

   oh  said the young man blankly
 you-

   i assented  mr brentwick la-
conically

  impulsively kirkwood leaned across
the table

  dorothy he said gently and
when the girl turned and her dreaming
eyes met his he quietly drew her atten-
tion to the card

  then he rose hastily and went over
and stood by the window staring out into
the night

  my dear-my dear protested the
old gentleman  positively i dont de-
serve this i dont i-the young-

old voice quavered and broke into a happy
laugh

   you must understand -more sober-
ly- that no consideration is due me
whatsoever i was too old for your
mother when we married but i believed
that it didnt matter it did i went
home-to america i thought our dif-
ference would not last long but your
mother died before i could return

   after that i was in no hurry just
before the old colonels death i came to
london to live and communicated with
him asking to be permitted to see you
he refused pointblauk-told me that he
would disinherit you if i did he was
very angry with me-justly  admit

   one must grow old before one can
see how unforgivably one was wrong so
 settled down to a quiet old age deter-
mined not to disturb you in your happi-
ness mr kirkwood 
after midnight



  kirkwood swung about from the win
dow the old gentleman was standing
with his arm around his daughters shoul-
der

   come here mr kirkwood he sug-
gested pleasantly  a word with you
sir

  kirkwood obeyed slowly

    dorothy said her father  the word
is really to you not to philip my dear
you did a very brave thing a little while
ago-a very brave womanly noble and
creditable action and philips words
were only second to yours i do hope to
goodness that you two young idiots are
not going to let any addle-pated scruples
stand between you and happiness 

  abruptly he dropped his arm from
about her shoulders and hopped nimbly
to the door  really i must see about
that petrol  he cried  its true that
charles lied but we really must be get-
ting on 

  and the door slammed

  the table was between them across
it the girl stood head erect lips firm and
sweet moisture gleaming on the lashes of

the

the eyes with which she met his question-
ing gaze so fearlessly

  the silence deepened about them
breathlessly fascinated kirkwood bent
toward her

  vou-dorothy you meant it
she laughed a little low sobbing
laugh  i meant it my dear-if youll
have a girl so bold and forward who
doesnt wait till shes asked but throws
herself at the head of the man she loves
i meant it all philip

  and as he came swiftly around the
table she turned to meet him arms up-
raised scarlet lips atremble the brown
adorable lashes drooping over her divine
and serenely childlike eyes

  after a while kirkwood laughed aloud
and there was that in his voice that
caused the shape of care which had for
the past ten minutes been luffing and fill-
ing in the offing and steadily diminishing
and growing more emaciated and pale
and indistinct-there was that in his
laugh i say which caused the shape of
care to utter a hollow croak of despair
and incontinently vanish

after midnight

    by william hamilton osbourne

 hw love when hunting for
 a disagreeable possibility
 unearthed a happy actuality j-

jg w oglethorpe of riv-
     erside drive took a firm hold

  	on the coat-lapel of his friend
tommy rogers and dragged
him into one of the small private rooms
in the millionaires club on the avenue

  tommy said old j c w ogle-
thorpe  im up against it and youve
got tohelp me out-just you and no one
else its-it about annette

  measles queried tommy rogers

  measles snorted j g y t
guess you havent seen annette for about
ten years its worse than measles

   shes grown up into a young woman
  tommy and-

a-ha responded tommy and
theres a man in the case i see a-ha

  youve hit the nail on the head
 tommy answered the old millionaire
  its almost a-man

  who is lie queried j g ws old
 crony the millionairefleaned forward
 and tapped tommys old and bony knee

  thats what i want you to find out
 lad he said

 rogers sat up

  d-dont she know he asked

  she knows all i know though she
 thinks she knows a heap more she
 knows his name  is name he added
  is john thatcher wing hes a
 society lad-or something worse i
 want to know ive got to be shown

  you know i married one of an-


the all-story magazine

nettes sisters to the count -dangelo-
a pig in a poke and another to whit-
tingham of london a member of
parliament you know about those
chaps and what they cost me and their
habits and proclivities are public prop-
erty

   well ive just about quit this
time its up to me not to make mistakes
nor will i let annette make any

  tommy rogers toddled out into the
corridor and returned with a fat direc-
tory under his arm but j g w shook
his head

   hes a society boy i tell you
roger he said  and all youll find in
there will be his name and residence
address he lives at the watkins arms
thats all

   on forty-third street assented
tommy rogers

   you look him up tommy will you
you know why i cant go to a detective
agency and i wont go to a mercantile
reporter if i do its bound to leak out
somehow ive got to trust to you

   i dont care a hang how fancy the
man is if hes decent and honest if
annette wants him and he wants an-
nette i dont care whether hes a butcher
or a bricklayer but hes got to be
straight he can be a willie if he wants
to but he cant be crooked not if hes
to deal with me youre on tommy
you find out when you find out itll
be terrapin and champagne on me

  now there was nothing that tommy
rogers liked so much as a mission of this
kind

  he was a man-about-town was tom-
my rogers with his little independent
income and nothing to do he had been
the same old two-and-sixpence for thirty-
seven years of his natty adult life

   fie called next morning at the watkins
arms and asked for mr john thatcher
wing he would not have known that
gentleman had he seen him but he
was not likely to see him either

  mr john thatcher wing he was in-
formed politely never rose before  pm
except on special occasions when he
arose at  pm would mr rogers
leave his card he would he accord-
ingly left the card of a brooklyn man
whom nobody knew then strolled back
to the club and reported

-	by george said old j- g w
 that fits in with what ive heard this
wing will go to picnics lectures
matinees-anything so long as its in the
afternoon yet when he talks to me its
always about the money market-the
details of it you understand

   yet hes never on the street-never
and theres not a broker down there
knows him either that ive been able to
find out he gets up at two eh well
what time does he go to bed 

   i reserved that inquiry for to-
morrow answered tommy rogers
slow and sure  ill see an elevator-boy
with a bit of a tip

  the next day he found out mr john
thatcher wing went to bed at seven in
the morning

  does he come home drunk he
inquired

  sober as a judge responded the
well-tipped elevator-boy for further
information the elevator-boy referred
mr tommy rogers to the clerk the
clerk had no information to give

   rules o the house you know the
clerk remarked

    ill tell you what you do said j g
w to rogers on the following day
 you come up to my place to-night
well have billiards and some good
cigars

   its dollars to doughnuts this wing
chap will be there he and annette
seem to be traveling in converging lines
its getting serious when he leaves our
place you follow him tommy what
do you think of that

  that suited tommy

  he was on time that evening and so
was wing but the two men did not
meet tommy caught a glimpse of him
through the curtains

   looks all right he said  but you
can never tell if id had time id
have brought a pair of sneakers and a set
o nippers and-and things

   oure too old for a good detective
tommy said the old millionaire  be-
sides theres the front door closing its
wing hes gone get into your duds
and follow him at once

  rogers followed him wing went al-
most as the crow flies down to his rooms
in the watkins arms and disappeared
within old rogers sneaked up in an
after midnight

elevator and ened at wings door
there was a light within bat there were
no voices

  now and then he heard wing hum-
ming a soft little song under his breath
s tommy rogers defended and loi-
tered about the hal and in the street
unit fifteen minutes to twelve and then
he left

   to-night evidently thought ro-
gers  hes piawn a straight game i
guess

  his views might have changed had he
known that at five minutes to twelve
oclock mr john thatcher wing
emerged from his rooms lid in  dark
business soit with a sioach-haz upon
his bead

  he did not know that mr wing de-
fended in the elevator and made his
way through the rear of the building into
an alleyway connecting forty-third with
f-rty-second street and disappeared

  as regular as clockwork however mr
john thatcher wing reappeared at the
watkins arms at  am ne day nodded
to the clerk and went to bed

  in the home of j g w oglethorpe
a crisis was approaching

  annette sobbed upon her fathers
shoulder

   he wants to marry me she pro-
tested and besides i want to marry
him

  the millionaire raised his eyebrows

   annette he said  would you marry
a man like dangeio to-day 

  no exclaimed the horrified an-
nette

    or-whittingham  

   nc repeated annette

    my dear said the millionaire softly
how much more do you know about
this wing than your sisters knew about
the other two 

    john thatcher wings a gentleman
replied annette loftily

    hats his business queried her
father  does he live on his money

   n -no returned annette he isnt
rich and he isnt poor

   and-his business

turned emphatically

old gentleman  and when we find out

pendent income we know that if

the all-story magazine

  his opportunity came sooner than he
had expected it came that evening it
was fully  pm when annettecalled
him into the parlor

  there was j ohn thatcher wing

   mr oglethorpe wing began and
his voice trembled   am acting under
the instructions of annette your-your
daughter she told me to-to ask you

right here in her presence- he

stopped

  the millionaire waited patiently

   well ask me he said  why dont
you ask me im here

   oh to be sure answered the red-
faced john thatcher wing  ill ask
you-for annette

  then his face paled

  the millionaire cleared his throat

   sit down he said j ohn thatcher
wing sat down but first he took his
watch from his pocket and looked at it

  the millionaire sparred for time he
started in on a desultory conversation
that began with the weather and threat-
ened never to let up at last john
thatcher wing rose to his feet once
more drew forth his timepiece and
stammered

   and-about annette he said

   by george he thought to himself
 ill be late if i dont look out

   th-thursday spluttered the mil-
lionaire for an idea had occurred to him
- th-thursday ill give you my answer
g-good night sir

  j g w oglethorpe stumbled over
himself in leaving the room but once
in the billiard-room he wasted no time
he called up his stable and ordered his
motor-car around at once

  in the hall john thatcher wing took
a hasty hut significant adieu of annette
and sped down the steps  ill have to
get a cab he told himself that old
duffer kept me so long

  he did not know that the old
duffer had directed his daughter to
wrap up in her duds and to come on
now no nunsensi-hed show her wing
did not know that a motor-car was fol-
lowing his cab up one street down an-
other

   oh yes thought the old million-
aire  ill give him his answer before
he knows it-and so will annette
wings cab trailed on in front

   i wont have time to go home he
muttered to himself so he stuck his head
out and uttered a brief direction to his
cabman who nodded then he kept on
and swung his horse into forty-second
street

  john thatcher wing leaped out in
front of an attractively lighted place-a
place that at that hour seemed to beckon
to all the midnight world-and disap-
peared within

  the motor-car pulled up behind him
the old millionaire saw nothing but the
glitter of the lights

   now girl he said to annette
fiercely for the recollection of dangelo
and of whittingham was fresh within
him  you come with me ill show you
no matter what the cost

  he pulled her-dragged her-behind
him together they slowly ascended the
steps of the glittering palace

  inside john thatcher wing stepped
through swinging doors then he flung
off his overcoat and looked at his watch

   on time to the minute he said
 its just twelve now you can go
old chap

  the old chap looked up

   got your togs on wing i see he
said

  he passed on out brushing against an
old man and a girl as he went but the
old man and the girl bustled in never-
theless one unwillingly the oilier with
determination

  john thatcher wing caught sight of
them as they came along he opened
a little gate and invited them inside an
enclosure

   to what he exclaimed with a smile
-a businesslike smile  do i owe the
honor of this visit  

  j g w oglethorpe puffed himself
up

   i told you young man he said se-
verely  that i would give you your
answer thursday your answer sir-
or mine-is ready yes sir you can
have her sir you can take her

   i couldnt wait till thursday to tell
you and neither could annette my
answer sir is  yes and good luck go
with you

  he went back to the motor-car while
john thatcher wing and annette did the
rest but annette was puzzled
the packing-case	

  what is this place she asked of
wing  and why didnt you ever tell
me

   i never told you dear said john
thatcher wing  because you never
asked and i suppose you never cared
but ill tell you now for the present
i am the head cashier of the all-

chapter i

a gruesome joke

the clock of st lukes was
chiming the second quarter after
midnight when i turned into
tedworth street

  it was the first night of my first play
and after the excitement of my  call
and the congratulations afterward when
everybody conspired to make me believe
that i had done something very wonder-
ful i had welcomed the idea of a long
walk home and was only sorry that the
distance between the theater and my
chambers on chelsea embankment was
not twice as great

  i knew that i should not sleep when
i had only to close my eyes to see again
the serried rows of faces which had
seemed to mass themselves into one vague
white glare in the moment that i stood
before the curtain when my ears rang
still with the deafening roar of applause
that had greeted me

  i hat consciously begun to loiter by
the time i auproached tedworth street
which is a mere double row of back
ardenf without a single hoise facing on
it for beyonc- lay tlu embankment and
my chambers snc  did not want to go
in yet

  then as i turned into the street my
steps arrested themselves altogether

night bank of new york city dont
you see 

  when j g w oglethorpe and tom-
my rogers had that dinner the all-
night bank of new york city was rep-
resented at it too

   my son-in-law sir said j g w
to tommy- my son-in-law-to be

  some twenty or thirty yards down it
two men showing dimly in the light of
the street-lamps appeared to be carrying
an oblong wooden case from the door of
one of the gardens to a hand-truck stand-
ing by the curb indistinct as the whole
scene was it was evident from the mens
movements that their burden was one of
considerable weight the lamplight
shcjwed nothing clearly except the white-
wood case

  it was no doubt an ordinary packing-
case and but for the lateness of the
iour and the dramatic tend of my own
thoughts i do not suppose i should have
found myself associating its dimensions
with those of a coffin or indeed should
have felt any curiosity over an incident
ihat in the daytime would have appeared
quite commonplace

  as the box was placed on the truck
one of the men turned his face toward
me and it seemed to me that the sight
of my approach made them hasten
whether it was so or not they certainly
acted with a surprising celerity by the
time i had taken the few steps necessary
to come abreast of them one man had
reentered the garden closing the door
behind him and the other had set off al
a rapid pace down the street wheeling
the truck with its burden before him

  i was in two minds whether to follow
him and see where he took it or to mind

 the packing-case

by nowell cay

hypocrisy corralling innocence tries a disappearing game but
runs loul of the law

a novel-complete in this issue


the all-story magazine

my own business i was standing now
just where the men had been but the tall
brick garden wall with its closed wooden
door made it impossible tor me to see
anything of the house from which they
had come

  a real estate agents board overhang-
ing the wall announced that tbe place
was to let and my suspicion that die
house was an empty one enabled me to
find a somewhat sordid explanation of
what i had seen i had little doubt
that the men were engaged in some un-
lawful enterprise but at the worst it was
probably that of the humble house-
stripper who lacking the enterprise and
daring needed for burglary devotes him-
self to the more arduous and less re-
munerative work of robbing empty
houses of such trifles as window-fittings
and lead piping

  this would account for the heaviness
of their load- and f felt a little ashamed
of the tragic suspicion with which i had
let it fill my mind i had allowed the
cigarette i had been smoking as i turned
into the street to go oat i now stopped
to relight it	-

  as i struck a match all my excite-
ment returned with redoubled force for
the light from the match had shown me
something glistening on the pavement
just in front of me in a moment i was
bending down over it with another light-
ed match in my hand to find that the
glistening spot which had caught my eye
was not alone

  fran the gate in tbe wail to the curb
where the hand-truck had stood ran a
regular succession of them-great drops
of wet blood

  all my indecision wi at an end and
with a last look at the doer in the wall
to assure myself that i could recognize
it again i set off at a run in pursuit of
the man with the truck

  he was just turning the corner in the
direction of the embankment and he
too must have begun to run  think
as soon as the corner was turned for by
the time i reached the embankment he
was still some considerable distance in
advance of me but it was easy to gain
ob hiny-when he bad such a considerable
weight to push before him and i slack-
ened my pace

  i do not think i am lacking in courage

or in public-spiritedness but although i
had no doubt that a crime had been com-
mitted i did not see that i was called
upon to try and capture the perpetrator
single-handed especially as i was quite
unarmed and had a very special reason
for wishing to be alive when the morn-
ings papers were on sale

  so i followed the truck at a set distance
until at the bottom of tite street where
the fortune i had prayed to favored me
and i caught sigh of a burly policeman
coming down

  he had not seen the man with the
truck passing and i was quite conscious
that he did not believe me when i panted
out that a murder had bc-en committed
and i was following the murderer carry-
ing away his victims body but when i
got him out into the roadway under the
trees the truck was still in sight and a
man wheeling a truck after midnight is
always an object of suspicion so c n-
stable smith as i learned to call him
later consented to trot after it with me
in pursuit

  the man in advance broke into a trot
also and put an end to my new allys
half- heart edness

   he cant get far with that barrow
to push he panted as we ran abreast
and i could tell from the tone that his
heart was in die chase

  but with the best intendons in the
world an english policeman cann-t ran
his dress is against it s much as his
habit of perpetual strolling and i had
soon outstripped him i was almost upon
our quarry when with another quick
glance behind him he dung down the
handle of the truck and leaving its
grimly suggestive load to look after itself
ran on unimpeded

   had been wondering why he had not
done so before when it was so evident
that we were overtaking him and i had
already decided that it was the man we
wanted the packing-case could wait
and i passed it without pausing

  it was a race of man against man now
but it seemed to me that the fugitive
was already exhausted while i was just
wanning up to the chase before he
could run another fifty yards i was
abreast of him and caught at his arm
warily for he was a big man quite a
head taller than myself and broad in
ill	i packing-case



proportion and i was on the lookout for
a knife or other weapon

  but the poor devil seemed past re-
sistance

  he turned and faced me panting pain-
fully for breath instead of running
straight forward he had taken a diagonal
course to the sidewalk nearest the river
and it was just under one of the embank-
ment lamps that we stood and faced each
other for a moment in silence

  i was conscious of a surprise none the
less great because it was  suppose
quite uncalled for i had taken it for
granted that i was pursuing a low-class
scoundrel and the man who faced me
was certainly not low-class

  he was dressed very quietly but his
serge suit had the unmistakable cut of
a good tailor his face with its keen
black eyes aquiline nose bushy black
mustache aud prominent chin struck
me in spite of the terror and distress it
showed as almost the typical face of the
successful banker or lawyer it seemed
indeed vaguely familiar to me as a face
i had come across in the illustrated
journals

  he was the first to speak and i was
prepared to find his voice confirming my
new impression of him he was des-
perately short of breath as i was too
hut the sight of the policeman trotting
like an overfed poodle toward us stirred
him to a desperate effort of bluff

   well and what can i do for you 
he panted and i was really taken aback
by the admirably acted tone which
abruptly seemed to make me and not
himself the person wh se duty it was to
explain his extraordinary conduct his
voice was that of a man accustomed to
speak with authority

   you can come aack and show me
what you havegot in that packing-case
i ssidl

effrontery  i was wheeling it home for
a wager and as one of the conditions
was that nobody should stop me or ask
what i was doing you can have the
satisfaction of knowing that you have
lost me a ten-pound note

  i nodded as though i believed him

   and may i ask why your old books
drip blood i demanded and watched
the last desperate hope forsake him

  he had been red in patches with his
running and beads of perspiration still
stood on his forehead but his face now
became white all over he uttered a
groan-the groan of a man who is faint-
ing-and i suppose the tight grip with
which i had not ceased to hold him
relaxed for a moment

  and in that moment when i thought
he would faint dead away he wrenched
his arm suddenly free and darted off
with a suddenness and agiliry for which
i was wholly unprepared he was
twenty yards away running alongside the
embankment wall before i recovered
from my surprise to start in pursuit

  but he was already flagging his
feet stumbled uncertainly and i did not
exert myself to the utmost as i ran after
him i was sorry afterward that i was
not quicker because i might have
reached him in time to avert the tragedy
i never anticipated it until i saw him
begin to clamber awkwardly over the
embankment wall and as it was my
hand was within a foot of his boot when
he dropped over clumsily into the
water

  the tide had passed the full and was
running out rapidly to sea and by the
time i had managed to get a glimpse of
him in the darkness he had been carried
a dozen yards down the stream and far-
ther out from the bank he did not
seem to be making any attempt t swim
and sank for the second time i suppose
almost as  caught sight of him

   it is not a pleasant thing to see a man
drovrn whatever he may be nd it turned

  he hesitated for just one moment and
 could see that he was deciding whether
to disown his connection with the pack-
ing-case altogether the lie would have
been too paltry when i had not once
lost sight of him since he abandoned
the truck and he no doubt realized the
fact

   oh the packing-case that contains
a lot of old book- that i have purchased
front a friend he said with admirable

me sick to think tht with a little more
quickness i might have prevented it
then i remembered that there were life-
buoys hung here and there along the
embankment ready for use and i had
turned excitedly to seek one when i met
constable smith trotting up breathlessly
with a life-buoy already in his hand


ihe all-story magazine

  we satisfied our excitement by dan-
gling ii as nearly as we could above the
place where  had seen the man disap-
pear but as we never got another glimpse
of him and i doubt very much whether
we could have thrown the life-buoy to
him if we had it took little more than
ten minutes to satisfy us that we vere
wasting our time and that he must be
given up as dead

  it was with a strange mingling of
morbid curiosity and humane concern
that i remembered the packing-case
which he had left at our mercy and we
made our way back to where it stood as
tbe suicide had abandoned it

  the embankment seemed to be wholly
deserted i had seen nobody there since
my pursuit of the hand-truck began ex-
cept the policeman and although con-
scious of a responsibility more weighty
than he was accustomed to he had blown
his whistle more than once for reinforce-
ments the summons had not as yet
brought even a curious night-bird to join
in our deliberations

  i had taken it for granted that we
should break open the case and satisfy
our curiosity as to its contents at once
but i was disappointed to find that it did
not agree with my companions idea of
police routine even when i showed him
an unmistakable stain of blood on tbe
under side of the case where it had evi-
dently oozed out between two loosely
fitting boards

   for all we know tbe body may have
life in it still i argued excitedly when
he protested that the opening of the case
was too serious a matter for us to under-
take on our own responsibility and that
we must wait till we reached the police
station

   and suppose it is not dead are you
a doctor  he demanded and i had to
admit that i was not

   then  do not see what good you
would do he said  and  dont know
wbethet you have a cliiscl in your pocket
but i kr w i have nothing to prize the
lid off with if i wanted to

  tbe second argument at least was
effective especially as i had not so much
as a penknife in my pocket

   then iet os hurry up and get it to
the station  said breathlessly  we
ought not to lose a minute-

  but again i was opposed by the con-
stables desire to consider all proper for-
mality

   i should get a reprimand or worse
it i left here without giving the river
police notice of the drowning s that
they can start dragging for the body
he said and blew his whistle again

  fortunately it was answered this time
by one of his colleagues from grosvenor
road and after what seemed to me an in-
terminable delay while smith explained
the affair pointed out the exact spot
where the fugitive had jumped into the
water and arranged that be should in-
form the river men we started for the
police station in kings road

  i lent a hand to the work and man-
aged to keep my companion trotting most
of tbe way

  i was consumed by a fever of impa-
tience apart from my curiosity i was
still counting on the chance that instead
of merely detecting a murder i might
be the means of saving a life the pack-
ing-case was too roughly put together to-
be anything like air-tight if a body
had been placed in it before death had
actually occurred it was possible that
when the box was opened at the police
station life might not be extinct and
although my stout companion was pant-
ing remonstrances all the way i did
not allow the pace to slacken until we
were at our destination

  in kings road there were still a few
people about and we had a little crowd
with us by the time we reached the sta-
tion door

  there seemed another interminable
delay while constable smith gave his
report and i was put through some sort
of examination but at last the packing-
case was on tbe flagged floor of the
charge-room and tools were brought to
unscrew the lid even then they seemed
to me painfully deliberate it was neces-
sary to note everything and to cause as
little d-sturbance to the case as possible
since the slightest detail might be useful
as evidence later on

  besides myself there were half a dozen
men in the room all policemen to whom

i suppose tragedy was not the rare
strange thng that it was to me but
i believe they were ail tensely interested
as tbe lid was opened
the packing-case



  at the top was a layer of earth inter-
ptrsed with old bricks which two of
the men took out carefully and deliber-
ately until when the box was half
empty the man in command suggested a
little impatiently that it should be placed
on its side earth and bricky came rat-
tling out together and at the bottom of
the case where the stain of blood was
visible the body of a lean half-starved
cat with its throat cut appeared there
was nothing else in the box

  there whs a moments dead silence
the faces of the ordinary constables were
terribly solemn the more so because that
of the chief was scarlet with anger

    it is all a silly practical joke i sup-
pose he said sharply and glared at me

  for an instant i had almost thought of
it as one myself until there flashed back
to my mind a vivid remembrance of the
terror and despair written on the face of
the man facing me on the embankment

  if it is a practical joke i said
gravely  it is a joke for which one man
has been willing to give up his life

chapter ii

the quick and the dead

  ik all my thoughts of the mystery of
the packing-case which the discovery of
its contents had only made more baffling
and exciting to me i had more or less
consciously looked forward to having my
curiosity satisfied fully only when t re-
turned to the house in tedworth street
which i felt i had been too precipitate
in considering uninhabited

  it would be when the police made in-
quiries there i had told myself that one
would get some facts to work upon and
i had sufficient faith in my own deduc-
tive power to think that a few facts were
all i needed to make an intelligible
theory out of the strange happenings i
had seen

  if you made some inquiry at the
house from which i saw the packing-
case taken i said with every show of
diffidence to the angry and suspicious
police inspector  perhaps it would en-
able us to understand why this apparent-
ly practical joke has been played

  the great man eyed me contemptu-
ously -

  	 s

   on what grounds can we make in-
quiries  he asked  a man has a per-
fect right to kill as msnv cats as he
pleases and cart them all over london
if he chooses it is not a matter for
police investigation or interference unless
the owners of the cats apply to us

  to my surprise constable smith who
had scarcely ceased to pant and mop his
perspiring face came to my assistance

   it will be necessary wont it sir
he suggested  to call at the house to
inform them of the deceased gentlemans
suicide and establish his identity 

  the inspector grunted

   that is a different matter if you are
sure that there has been a suicide-

  i hastened to assure him that the sui-
cide at least was genuine i had seen
the man sink without making any attempt
to swim it seemed to me absolutely im-
possible that he could have saved himself
afterward while i was seeking the life-
buoy

  the inspector was not so sure he
seemed to imagine that the desperate man
i had faced on the embankment had not
only given himself a great deal of
trouble and exertion in filling and wheel-
ing the packing-case but had also taken
a midnight dive fully dressed into a
dangerous current for the single purpose
of making the police force ridiculous
and i believe he more than half suspected
that i was an accomplice in the plot

  but constable smith was fortunately
as emphatic as i was in declaring that the
man was drowned and the debate ended
in his being told off to make inquiries at
the house in tedworth street in order
to establish the identity of the suicide
it was necessary for me to accompany
him to point out the particular door
from which i had seen the packing-case
carried and although i should have done
so in any case i was not sorry to have a
sort of official right to take part in his
investigations

  i felt a thrill of anticipation not un-
connected with the expectation of per-
sonal danger as we stepped out again
into the deserted streets i had tried to
persuade the inspector to give us another
man but he would not make even that
much admission that there was anything
more than an ordinary case of suicide to
investigate

n
to

the all-story mah azin i

   we can only deal with facts not
with theories mr herbert he said to
me as though he were saying some-
thing sensible and dignified

  but it seemed to me that the theories
he dismissed so contemptuously were of
some importance to constable smith and
myself when they offered us the only
means of guessing what reception we
were going to receive in tedworth
street

  i returned to them as soon as we had
started on our quest

   i never doubted for a moment-after
the man ran away-that there was a mur-
dered human being in that box did
sou sir  smith was saying as he suited
his pace to that of easy and confidential
conversation

  not for a moment i said and
what is more i am perfectly certain that
the fellow who was wheeling it never
doubted that there was a murdered body
in it he has been fooled in some way
by the people in the house we are going
to if there has not been a murder-
and they may have had some reason of
their own for keeping the body-at any
rate there has been a conspiracy to mur-
der and it will take pretty skilful ques-
tioning to get anything out of them
how do you propose to set to work 

  constable smith had more imagina-
tion than i had at first given him credit
for the idea his chief seemed to have
that he had allowed himself to lie made
a fool of over the packing-case when he
had so patently done no more than his
duty rankled within him and i found
him as ready as i was to prove to his
superior that he was treating the affair
too lightly

  we discussed a plan of campaign as
we walked and were still engaged on it
when we reached the scene of operations

  i had no difficulty in recognizing the
door through which  had seen the box
carried and to make my recognition cer-
tain the constables lamp showed the
dotted line of blood across the pavement

  the door was locked and smith
pulled the bell-handle at the side only
to find it broken

  he looked up at the notice-board

  if i remember rightly the house is
an empty one-been empty for months
he said  lets go round to the front

  the front of the houses were in an-
other street and we counted the garden
doors from the corner to make sure of
locating the one we wanted

  it was called erdenshaw house and
in each of its blank uncurtained windows
was a bill announcing that the place was
to let from its air of neglect it might
well have been unoccupied for the best
part of a year as smith averred but
we went through the form of trying
the door and sounding a summons on
bell and knocker

  as the sound died away unanswered
we stood and looked at each other a lit-
tle blank ly

   well i should like to have a
glance at that back garden i said  i
could manage to get over the wall with
your assistance

  so back we went to tedworth street
and in a few moments i was dropping
down from the high wall into the dark-
ness of the garden he door was for-
tunately bolted-not locked-and i had
no difficulty in opening it and admitting
my companion

  his bulls-eye lantern played on an
uncultivated waste that might once have
been a garden but showed no sign of
vegetation now beyond a few chimps of
rank grass and weeds in one corner
there had probably at some distant date
been a rockery and it was here to all
appearance that the packing-case had
been filled for the heap of earth and
bricks had been recently disturbed we
bent over the spot- examining it care-
fully and came to the conclusion that
the ballast for the box had been dug
out by hand

  but it was really all that the garden
had to tell us carefully as we investi-
gated every foot of it the house was as
well secured at the back as in front and
i doubted whether the conspirators had
entered it at all or had any connection
with it

  my companion was copying down in
his note-book the name and address of
the real estate agent who had the letting
of the house but it seemed to me that
the place had ceased to have any impor-
tance as a clue i said so to the con-
stable

   then we can only wait until the
body is recovered from the river sir
the packing-case



he questioned with disappointment in
his voice

  i	too should have been disappointed
if  had been compelled to take no fur-
ther active part in the elucidation of the
mystery

   i should like to have a look at that
truck at the station i said  i never
thought of noticing whether there was
a name on it

  constable smith had not thought of
noticing either and his face brightened
as he assured me that a liand-truck with-
out the owners name on it was quite a
rarity

  letting him out of the garden i
bolted the door again and clambered up
it and over the wall as i have no doubt
its last occupant had done

  we walked back to the station build-
ing new hopes on the clue that the truck
might give us it might even discover
for us the identity of the second man
which was of even more importance to
us than that of the suicide

  but at the police station i found
awaiting me a reception even more cold-
ly suspicious than before the inspector
laughed aloud at our report so we had
actually discovered that some earth and
old bricks might have been removed
from the place where the packing-case
was filled

   we are not investigating the death
of a cat mr herbert he said severely
to me and he refused pointblank to let
me inspect the truck

  it is very kind of you to wish to
assist us he went on in his tone of
angry irony  but we are quite capable
of conducting our own business

  it seemed that the river police had
been telephoning to ask whether there
was any certainty that a man was
drowned they had found no sign of
the body and thought constable smith
might have made a mistake partly as
punishment he was ordered to report
himself at the floating station and give
them any further details that they re-
quired if indeed be had actually seen a
man in the water

  this latter piece of information i re-
ceived from smith himself after i had
been practically turned out of the place

  i had loitered about outside on the
chance that he might join me and met

him starting off on his errand he had
managed with difficulty to give a rapid
examination to the truck which now
stood in the station-yard behind but had
found on it no name or distinctive marks
at all and it was apparent that he was
feeling blue

   the chief does not believe that there
was a suicide at all he said moodily
 he thinks the whole thing was a prac-
tical joke and that if you were not in
it you fancied a good deal more than
happened and stuffed me up and of
course i cant say that i actually saw
the man in the water i only caught a
glimpse of him climbing over the para-
pet

   i am in the chiefs black books till
the body is found and with the cur-
rent running out strong like that it may
not be found for weeks or it may not be
found at all it is a bad lookout for me
unless you can follow up the clue from
the packing-case sir

   there is not much chance of that
when they wont even let me see it
again i said

  i was feeling quite disheartened

  it was now between two and three
oclock but if i had felt unprepared for
sleep when i turned the corner of ted-
worth street at half past twelve i was
still more wakeful now i had reached
that state of mental activity when only
continuous action at high pressure seems
satisfying and abruptly i saw myself
with nothing to do

  my part in the nights work was
ended and i shrank from the reaction
that would come when i allowed my-
self to admit the fact in fear of it i
even thought of accompanying the con-
stable to his interview with the river
police but the journey lacked incentive
since i could tell them no more than
smith himself and the chances of their
finding the body that night seemed so
remote

  so very reluctantly i bade my friend
the policeman good night at a point on
the embankment not far from where we
had first met and turned my face once
more toward home

  there was no necessity of course for
me to pass through tedworth street on
my way but i was reluctant to go in
and admit that the excitement of the


the aii-story magazine

night was over so far a-  was con-
cerned and i made a detour to stroll
once more through the quiet thorough-
fare

   it had been quite silent and deserted
when i visited it with constable smith
but now as i turned the corner  became
aware that there were other footsteps
than mine breaking the night-silence

   a man like myself in evening dress
was strolling toward me on the opposite
side of the street the light of a lamp
as he passed it showed me his white
shirt-front but little more and instinct-
ively i drew farther into the shadow of
the wall to watch him

   the mere fact that he was in this par-
ticular street of all others at half past
two in the morning made him interest-
ing and i waited observantly for him
to pass the next lamp the next lamp
was almost opposite the garden door of
erdenshaw house the strangc-r reached
it and i drew my breath quickly for
he had stopped and turned toward the
fateful house i altogether forgot to
breathe i believe as he stretched out his
arm and pushed at the door as if ex-
pecting it to be unlocked finding it
firmly secured he stood a moment then
stepped out into the road as if to try
to obtain a view of the house the
house was not visible from the street as
i could have told him and he strolled
on again crossing to my side of the way

   more or less instinctively  had been
trying to keep out of sight but there
was no doubt that he would see me when
he passed and realizing the fact i
walked onward openly to the next lamp-
post and waited there making a pretense
of finding my matches and lighting a
cigarette

  i watched the approaching figure
keenly as i did so and i think that i
guessed the exact moment at which he
became aware of my presence in the
street

  his hand moved to his pocket and
reminded me again that i was quite un-
armed

  he was advancing toward me slowly
and it seemed to me warily his hand
still at his pocket and already indis-
tinct as the tall stalwart figure was in
the darkness it impressed me with a
vague and disquieting feeling of famil-

iarity which increased as he came nearer
then as lie reached the circle of light
thrown by the street-lamp near which i
had taken up my position the cigaret
i had been pretending to light fell from
my lips and  had difficulty in restrain-
ing an exclamation

   for the keen black eyes that met mine
the aquiline nose the bushy black mus-
tache and resolute chin were familiar

  it was the man whom less than two
hours earlier i had seen throw himself
desperately into the river and sink un-
resistingly in the swiftly ebbing tide

  he stared at me frankly with a ques-
tioning curiosity but without the least
sign of recognition and i saw his face
plainly and clearly

  it was not distorted now by the ex-
pression of terror and despair i had seen
on the embankment but the features
were too striking and characteristic as
was the figure also to allow any change
of expression or of dress to leave me in
a moments doubt that it was the man
whom i had been looking on as dead

  for a moment i thought he was going
to address me as his keen searching eyes
met mine but the next he had passed on
and i stooped to recover my lost cigar-
ette

   i took just as long as i wished to find
and light it and then turned to follow
him

  i felt completely bewildered and i
must admit a little unnerved sick with
apprehension in the moment that i
thought he was going to stop and speak
 dreaded to find myself at the mercy
of a man who two hours before had been
at mine and had all the agony of hope-
less terror i had seen on his face to pay-
back

  it was useless for me to remind my-
self that the apparent suicide must have
been a pretense and as a corollary that
the terror had been a pretense too i
could not believe it if the man i was
slowly following had turned i believe i
should have taken to my heels and run
for my life-

  but he continued to walk on at his
slow sauntering pace and i followed
him at a discreet distance from ted-
worth street to the embankment where
i had the satisfaction of seeing him turn
into one of the big residential blocks
the packing-case



within a stones throw of that in which
my own chambers were situated

  the whole place was in darkness and
i waited anxiously to see whether a light
would appear at any of the windows
when my patience was rewarded by see-
ing a room on the first-floor illuminated

i felt safe in concluding that i had at
last taken one small step toward eluci-
dating the mystery of the packing-case

  i had discovered the address of the
principal actor

  if my friend constable smith had been
at hand to give me the support and pro-
tection of the law i should have been
inclined to call on the man at once and
cross-examine him  he had not laid
himself open to a charge of attempted
suicide we should at least be justified in
asking him what he wished to be done
with a hand-truck and a packing-case
which he had left in our hands

  the idea of exacting a statement of
any sort from one of the men actually
concerned in the mystery was alluring
and i was not sorry to remember that i
owed a duty to the river police

  it was not fair to let them go on drag-
ging for a man when i had the best rea-
son for knowing that the man was not
drowned i must go to the floating
station to report what i had seen and
there or on my way to it along the em-
bankment i should see constable smith
and could consult with him as to our
next move

  as a matter of fact i met him just
coming out his face brightened at the
sight of me

   i have news for you i said speak-
ing before he could  after all the
man was not drowned  have seen
him-in tedworth street again and
found out where he lives

  constable smith stared at me

   i think you have made a mistake
sir he said

  a mistake why

   because they have just found the
body sir i was coming to see you about 
it the inspector wouid like you to say
whether it is the man we followed with
the hand-truck you see sir  never
really saw his face and it has become
important the body is at the station
here if you will come in

  i did not stop to prove to him that it

could not be the body of the man we had
seen it would be enough to see it and
say that it was not so i followed him
down the gangway and in a few more
minutes i had been introduced to the
officials and ushered into the room where
the body had been laid

   i believe i turned a little faint as i
looked at it  know that the inspector
who was standing at my side put out his
hand and held my arm as if to support
me and that i did not resent the action

   is that the man that you followed
along the embankment and whom you
saw throw himself into the river he
said and i nodded

    yes that is the man

   you are quite sure

   quite sure i held him for a mo-
ment just before he jumped in and i
noticed his face particularly as well as
this serge suit he is wearing

    it is very strange said the inspec-
tor  i do not know whether you have
recognized who it really is-his name i
mean 

  i shook my head

   you have heard of sir caleb burn-
ham of course i recognized him at
once and so did most of the men and if
we needed any confirmation the initials
 c b on his clothing

  sir caleb burnham i could under-
stand smith saying that the case had be-
come important for sir caleb burn-
ham the christian company promoter as
he was called was one of tiie most prom-
inent figures of the day and i knew
now why his face had seemed so fam-
iliar to me from the first

   it was because i had so often seen his
portrait in the religious journals where
lie was held up as a proof that a finan-
cier can be a devout christian and while
making great wealth for himself serve
his fellows by promoting semi-philan-
thropic enterprises ill which it was pos-
sible for the most religiously minded man
to invest his savings with the utmost cer-
tainty that he was using his money for a
good cause besides earning a perfectly
safe seven per cent guaranteed by the
undoubted piety and honesty of the
promoter

   it is very strange the inspector
continued  for sir caleb burnham
would seem the last man to wheel a


the all-story magazine

truck about at night and take his life
to avoid being detected doing it you
are quite sure that this is the man you
saw

   quite sure i said

  there was no possibility of doubt in
my mind in spite of the man so exactly
like him whom i had left behind me in
sartor mansions

chapter iii

in sartor mansions

  i was quite prepared to find that the
police took very little interest in the ac-
count of my meeting with the dead mans
 double  in tedworth street a resem-
blance so exact has to be seen to be be-
lieved when one is asked to believe in
it on hearsay it is more easy to dismiss
it as a mere hallucination

  my mind had been full of the suicide
i had witnessed  in a dark street  passed
a man of about the same height and size
as the victim what was more natural
than that  should imagine a complete
resemblance

  i knew quite well how my story would
be received and  should not have
thought it worth while telling but for
the fact that the stranger had actually
stopped and tried the fateful door from
which i had seen sir caleb burnham
start on his journey-to death

  and the fact only seemed to make
the inspector at the floating station more
certain that i had been allowing my
imagination to run away with me he
was a very decent fellow a pleasing con-
trast to his confrere of kings road but
despite ins politeness it was apparent to
me that my story made no effect upon
him at all

  i did not blame him but i was dis-
appointed in constable smith when i
left the station with him i was imagin-
ing that with him as with me the recov-
ery of the body was a secondary affair
the mystery of the packing-case seemed
to me our particular business

  it was easy to see that the police dis-
missed it as a minor incident-a very
curious incident no doubt but one which
the evidence at the inquest the ordinary
evidence of relatives and friends would
serve to explain

  my own view was that the suicide
would never be explained until the mys-
tery of the packing-case was solved and
 expected that smith would agree with
me and be as eager as i was to follow
up our investigations from the end which
his superiors seemed determined to ig-
nore

  but i was disappointed to find that
the ally on whom i had counted was
stolidly and completely satisfied the
body was found and his chief could no
longer deny that there had been a suicide
or pretend that he had done any more
than his duty in taking to the-station the
property the dead man had left behind
him

  he was completely justified and it
was all that he cared about he was
only anxious to get back with his report
and he was not interested in the man at
sartor mansions even when i could
point out to him in passing that the
light in his window was still showing

  smith said that he did not see what
the man had to do with the case and i
did not trouble to reiterate the point i
kept clear in my own mind that he had
proved his connection with the mystery
conclusively by trying the door in the
garden of erdenshaw house

  i bade the constable a second good
night at the entrance to my own cham-
bers and went indoors to root out of a
drawer a very serviceable revolver for
which i had found very little use after
i had settled down to the serious stav-at-
home work of the novelist the revolver
was however still in good order and i
charged its six chambers hastily i did
not want the man in the next block to
turn the light out in his room before i
was ready to visit him and i lost no
time in getting back to the street

  but short as had been the time i spent
on preparation for the interview i found
the light gone and the whole block
wrapped once more in darkness

  i stood staring undecidedly having
made up my mind to risk the imperti-
nence and possible danger of calling on
a man whose name i did not know at
four oclock ir the morning with no ex-
cuse beyond my gratuitous belief that
lie would be -nterested to hear of sir
caleb burnhams death i felt very loath
to put off the visit
the packing-case



   but there are limits to the effrontery
of which i am capable even under the
spur of a maddening curiosity and it
stopped at the idea of rousing the
stranger after he had retired i had de-
cided very reluctantly that the interview
on which i was counting for at least
some satisfaction of my curiosity must
wait till the morning when the door
opened and out came the very man i
wanted so much

   i was relieved and at the same time i
was a little startled and-well i
clutched at the revolver in my pocket
as i imagined again from his attitude
that the stranger was fingering his

  he must have given a good deal more
observation to my movements than i had
fondly imagined for he walked straight
to me

   who are you and what do you
want   he asked in a sharp tone of
nervously impatient demand

  the man who was dead had addressed
me in very much the same tone but the
voices were very different the one to
which i listened now was despite its
owners evident impatience more gentle
and refined than the other and helped to
encourage a theory which had been form-
ing itself in my mind

  as a practised writer of detective
stories i should have been ashamed of
myself if i had not evolved a theory
which made the police ridiculous they
were puzzled to conjecture how a man
of sir caleb burnhams stamp could
take his life and why he should have
abandoned his usual dignity so far as to
wheel a truck along the embankment
before he did so

  my idea was that sir caleb burnham
would not think of doing either that
the drowned man was impersonating him
for some reason and that the real sir
caleb was the gentleman to whom i had
the honor of speaking at any rate the
theory gave me my best excuse for
forcing an interview

  sir caleb burnham i believe i
said very formally and politely

   well and if i am sir caleb burn-
ham   he retorted in the same tone of
nervous impatience making me quite
confident that my theory was a true one

   i thought it might interest you to
know that you are drowned  said

   to be more explicit i continued
as he stared at me  the body of a man
bearing a most remarkable resemblance
to you has just been fished out of the
river by the police and identified by them
without a moments hesitation as sir
caleb burnham so unless you take
steps to prevent it the news will be all
over london to-morrow that you have
committed suicide sir caleb

  he regarded me with undisguised sus-
picion

   i do not see your object in telling me
this he said his tone full of distrust

   i am surely justified in thinking that
it is of interest to you i replied easily
and he interrupted me with nervous im-
patience

   it is confoundedly interesting if it
is true but who are you and what is
your object if i believe you what do
you want me to do

  i had ceased to think about my re-
volver although i imagined that my com-
panion was still keeping a ready finger
on his and i handed him my card

    my ulterior object is to satisfy a very-
active curiosity i said  my connec-
tion with the affair is only that of an
accidental observer but what i have
seen to-night has mystified me to the
point of frenzy and in exchange for my
news i am hoping that you will be able
to give me some and that between us we
shall get some solution of about the most
bewildering series of events that has ever
come under my notice

  he was watching my face as i spoke
too intent on trying to read from it
whether i was speaking the truth to
glance at the piece of cardboard i had
handed him he remembered it abruptly
and moved a step nearer the street-lamp
by which we were standing to read my
name i could see the doubt and sus-
picion fade from his face

   not mr selwyn herbert the novel-
ist he asked his voice and manner
suddenly aifiiable

  i should have been more pleased if he
had said the playwright but it was of
course early days for that and i was
very glad that my tales at least were
sufficiently well known to him to serve as
an introduction

  my companion said some very pleasant
things about my latest detective stories


the all-story magazine

   if anybody can solve a mystery-and
this one lias been bewildering me for a
month-i should think you can mr
herbert he said warmly  if you
really do not mind giving tne the time
i should be awfully glad to nave your
ideas on it especially as you seem to have
seen something that probably has a bear-
ing on it

  i smiled to myself at his idea that the
writing of detective stories in which one
really begins with the solution and works
back to the mystery is any proof of
actual detective ability but i did not
wish to lessen his pleasing faith in me
and in this case i felt pretty confident
that his  mystery  would serve as the
key to mine i had a hundred questions
to ask him

   i shall be only too pleased i said
to begin with were you aware that
you had a double if you were and
know his name we have  think estab-
lished the identity of the man who
drowned himself to-night

  he looked at me as if my question had
for the moment bewildered him and
smiled faintly

   if the police have identified him as
sir caleb burnham and he is as much
like me as you say then i suppose it i
-sir caleb burnham he said slowly
 and for some reasons i am not sorry
to hear that he is dead

  i stared at him

  sir caleb burnham then who are
you  

   oh  my name is carton-dudley
carton rut there is no need for us to
stand talking in the street come up to
my rooms

  he turned toward the door of the dark
block before which we had been stand-
ing as he spoke but i hesitated

  i am not a coward but at the same
time i am not foolhardy and it seemed
to me that there would lie something a
little foolhardy in accepting the invita-
tion from a man of whom i knew nothing
except that he had been accused of a par-
ticularly ferocious and apparently mo-
tiveless murder and owed his acquittal to
a happy chance

  glancing back quickly be saw my
hesitation and shrugged his broad shoul-
ders

   well talk in the street if you prefer

it he said  you recognize my name
i suppose it is not the name  am
living under now but as i was going
to tell you the whole storv it seemed
silly to start with a deception i forgot
that it would have the same effect ou
you as on other people

   hut i think you might at least hear
my account of the affair before fighting
shy of me like everybody else just be-
cause of an old fishermans mistake that
he did not even stick to i know it is
asking a lot of you but you might at
least hear my side

  his humility was touching and i had
sufficient sense of justice to remember
that the charge against him had been dis-
missed if he had shown the least eager-
ness to persuade me to enter the house
i should have refused but as it was-
well i remembered among other things
that i had a revolver

   of course i will hear it if it is part
of your  mystery  i said  and it will
be more comfortable to hear it indoors
thanks if you will lead the way

  i	followed him not without the little
thrill which adds to the pleasure of do-
ing something a trifle daring to the room
on the first floor at which i had looked
more than once with so much interest
from the embankment

  the interior although comfortable
enough was too plainly suggestive of the
 furnished apartment to make me
waste attention by looking around it for
indications of my hosts character or
tastes

  my host solicitously pulled forward
an armchair for me then sat down on
the other side of a center-table

   this is awfully good of you he
said pushing a cigar-hox toward me
 and i feel it all the more because i
am really a complete stranger in the
country i left england as a young-
ter and never saw it again till a couple
of month ago and  must say that i
have had a pretty rough time here so
far

   they told me at melbourne that i
should find the old country slow but
so far ive found it pretty exciting it
does not fall to the lot of every visitor
to your country to be accused of murder
within a month of his landing i sup-
pose
  i	was searching my memory for the
details of the affair

   so far as  remember the newspaper
report  said  you were accused of
clubbing a man on the front parade at
broadstairs and throwing the body over
the cliff you were recognized as the as-
sailant by somebody-a fisherman wasnt
it-who witnessed the affair but his
evidence was upset by your lawyer with
the assistance of a lucky chance i took
a note of the affair at the time as one of
the few things one sees in the papers
dramatic enough to do service in a plav

  carton threw out his hands in a ges-
ture of expostulation

   that is how everybody puts it and
it is not fair they talk as though i got
off by a lucky chance the chance-
and a damnably unlucky one-was that i
was suspected at all but let me tell
you just what happened

  he spoke with strong feeling and half
rose from the chair but my attitude
reminded him i suppose that i was a
little suspicious of him still and he sank
back his arms hanging ostentatiously
limp over the sides of his chair his voice
dropping again to the conversational
note

   i went to broadstairs he said
 just to see the house where charles
dickens worked id been to gads hill
and yarmouth and had visited practi-
cally every spot in yordon that he men-
tions in his books or that he has been
connected with i worship charles
dickens

  ii	so do  fr said and decided that i
liked the man

   it was really the chief thing 
wanted to come home for i left eng-
land as  told you when i was ten and
 have no personal interests here but
i always said that when  could afford
it-

  i nodded impatiently

   and the dickens pilgrimage took
you naturally to broadstairs where the
story begins  

   yes i put up at the albion hotel
n here i found myself the only visitor
had dinner and walked out on the front
it was quite deserted it being out of
the season you know and as it was al-
ready dark i went for a stiff walk leav-
ing bleak house for the morning

   when  got back the place had
changed there was quite a crowd on
the front and they told me that a man
had been murdered and thrown over the
cliff a fisherman had seen it all and
had run up in time to seize the murderer
but the man had proved too powerful
for him after a short struggle he had
knocked his would-be captor down and
made good his escape

   the fisherman had been too much
dazed by his knock-down blow to know
in what direction he had gone and had
hurried into the town with the news of
what had happened the crowd was
watching some half-dozen boats pad-
dling about near the foot of the cliff
looking for the victims body and 
waited there watching with them until
a wiry little man in a blue fisherman
jersey who had just come on the scene
with a policeman made a sudden rush
at me yelling like a maniac

   thats him-thats him seize
him dont let him get away

   he had me by the throat and the
policeman grabbed my arm and pre-
vented my knocking him off to answer
for myself and i believe every man in
the crowd and some of the women got
a grip of me somewhere or other

   the policeman persuaded them not
to throw me over the cliff i believe
but by the time i had been dragged up
to the station my coat was hanging in
rags around me and my collar and tie
had gone altogether and that on my
solemn word of honor mr herbert is
the only part i played in the broadstairs
murder as they call it

  he waited as if for an expression of
opinion but i gave none and he con-
tinued 

   i was locked up in a cell for the
night and the next morning was brought
up before the magistrates i had man-
aged to see a lawyer but he seemed to
think that i was sure to be committed as
the fisherman was so certain of his recog-
nition there was of course no other
evidence against me except that i was
a stranger and therefore a natural ob-
ject of suspicion

   to make matters worse the body of
the murdered man had been found and
from papers in his pockets it appeared
that he too had quite recently come
-

the all-story magazine

from australia tbt fact increased the
suspicion against me but the charge ac-
tually rested entirely on the fisherman 
certainty that he recognized me unless
that was shaken my lawyer gave me to
understand that he could not save me
from being sent to trial

   at the examination therefore he
directed all his efforts to making the wit-
ness show some uncertainty  he fisher-
man was not to be moved it was dark
but there was light eroagh for him to
see the murderer plainly when he grap-
pled with him he could nii say what
the material of his clothes was but he
was sure of his height and build

    and suppose you were told that at
the time you were struggling with the
murderer this gentleman was quietly
dining a the albion hotel asked my
lawyer who was preparing a feeble at-
tempt at an alibi  what should you
say	-

    i should say it was a lie said the
witness and won a murmur of approval
from the crowded room

   the lawyer who was so vainly try-
ing to clear me looked round as if to
deprecate it and seemed for a moment to
have forgotten his cross-examination

   he was staring across the room at
the crowd by the door and i saw his face
brighten suddenly

    sir caleb burnham he said rais-
ing his voice to speak across the room
 would you mind stepping forward a
moment sir caleb dont go please
i wont keep you a minute if you will
spare me it

   there was a stir in the room and
sir caleb came up to the solicitors table
with evident annoyance in his manner
it was the first time i had seen him and
even i noticed the resemblance he bore
to me at once although  suppose that
one does not realize it so quickly as other
people

   the lawyer asked him to stand by
the side of the pew where they had caged
me and turned to the fisherman again
but the witness did not wait for a ques-
tion   why thats the man  he shouted
excitedly  i thought the other one had
a bit too much color and too much brown
on his face but the white-faced one is
him

   everybody laughed even the magis-

trates the old mans sudden change of
opinion after the certainty with which
he had been swearing that he recognized
me was very funny and to make the joke
complete it seemed that everybody in the
court knew sir caleb burnham by name
as an uncommonly good and pious sort of
big-bug

   my lawyer got another laugh by ask-
ing him whether he had committed the
murder and he replied without going
into the witness-box or being sworn that
he had only come down by the midnight
train and had not even heard of the
murder till he looked in at the court
through idle curiosity

  when my host had reached this point
in his narrative i interrupted him

   i read the case in the papers i said
 but so far as i remember they did not
mention sir caleb burnhams name
carton shook his head

   no as far as i can make out it never
appeared in print he seemed to me
throughout very much annoyed by the
position in which the lawyers recognition
had placed him and i imagine that he
paid to keep his name out of it as far as
possible there were i believe only a
few local reporters present and i sup-
pose they could be bribed to speak of
him as a well-known public man in-
stead of giving his name but what does
that prove

   nothing unless sir caleb actually
murdered the man at broadstairs and
could not restrain his eagerness to know
what evidence was given at your exam-
ination what do you think 

  carton threw out his hands in a gesture
of exasperated impotence

   oh i am sick of thinking i f he
did commit the murder it does not seem
to explain in any way the strange things
that happened afterward-the mystery
that baffles me and that  am hoping you
will help me to solve mr herbert

chapter iv

                                

a gvest of sir caleb

  i wiu do my best i said but
please go on

   i will go straight on if you dont
mind he said  just as things hap-
pened though i cant decide of course
the packing-case



what would seem important to you and
what wouldnt

   as you know the charge against me
was dismissed my lawyer urged that
there was now no evidence against me
the only evidence had been that of the
fisherman and he admitted emphatically
that i was not the man he had struggled
with the murderer probably bore some
slight resemblance to me as also to the
deeply respected gentleman who seemed
almost to have been sent by a watchful
providence to clear me from a baseless
suspicion it would be as preposterous
to send me for trial on the mere strength
of that resemblance as it would be to
send sir caleb himself

   after a little discussion among them-
selves the magistrates agreed that there
was no case against me and i was dis-
charged  have often wished since that
i had been sent to trial and had the case
absolutely thrashed out but i took it for
granted that the dismissal of the charge
meant that i was cleared from suspicion

   the whole business had seemed to
me ridiculous and instead of feeling
thankful for my escape as the lawyer
seemed to expect i was only thinking of
the annoyance i had been put to

   i soon found out that the annoyance
had only begun i went with my lawyer
to his office and waited there until he
could get me a cab to take me back to
my hotel at broadstairs the news of
my acquittal had preceded me and as
i was running up to my room feeling
very anxious to get into a respectable
dress again the manager met me bar-
ring my way

   my luggage had been deposited at
the police station and he handed me my
bill for the dinner i had had there it
was all the charge they wished to make
and i gathered from the managers man-
ner that even that charge would not be
pressed if i would relieve the hotel of
my presence instantly i paid my bill
drove back to the police station for my
luggage and tried another hotel but it
was just the same very politely but
very firmly they regretted that they
could not give me a room

   by this time there was a crowd fol-
lowing my cab and hooting me finally
i had to change my clothes at the police
station and ask for an escort to see me

to the next train leaving the town i
took ticket to london and left the whole
population of broadstairs congratulating
itself i believe that a dangerous mur-
derer had been driven from its midst

   i still imagined that the feeling
against me was purely local and 
reaching town  went back to the apart-
ments  had occupied while i was follow-
ing charles dickens about fleet street
and the temple the landlady seemed
glad to see me back till the evening
papers came out

   thanks to a scarcity of news or the
touch of drama by which my acquittal
had been secured the journals had made
a sensation of it and when my landlady
came to me with a scared face and pre-
tended that she had made a mistake and
that my rooms had really been let to
somebody else who wanted to come into
them at once i realized for the first time
that the thing was serious after the
publicity given to my name i foresaw
that the treatment i had received at
broadstairs was likely to be the treat-
ment i should receive everywhere you
know yourself mr herbert what effect
it had on you even now you think that
you are doing a rather daring thing in
sitting here alone with me

  he spoke very-seriously and went on
without giving me an opportunity to
reply

   and i have no doubt the news will
go over to melbourne and be made much
of there it will ruin the hopes i had
of a political career when i go back un-
less that unfortunate tragedy at broad-
stairs is explained and so far there
seems  chance of its being cleared up

   the man murgatroyd who was
killed had only been two days in eng-
land and apparently had  connections
here they cant even discover why he
went to broadstairs or what he was do-
ing there but of course you have read
all that the papers have hail to say about
him and know as much about him as i
do i have set a private detective 
the business and i have stayed in lon-
don to keep in touch with him but he
has found out no more than the police
and charges me pretty heavily for that

   i suggested to him yesterday as you
suggested to-night that sir caleb burn-
ham might have actually been the mur-


he all-story magazine

                                              

derer but he laughed at the idea i
dont believe in these private detectives
and that is why i am so awfully glad to
put the facts before an acknowl-
edged-

  and he said more pleasant things
about my detective stories which tended
only to show that he confused the writer
of them with the hero

   moved my hand farther from my re-
volver-pocket as i deprecated his com
pinnents

   have you had any reason to connect
burnham with the murder apart from
the fishermans imagined recognition
i asked

  carton shook his head

   with the murder no none at all
it is his connection with me that i cant
understand and whether he killed the
man at broadstairtor not does not seem
to me to make any explanation of it pos-
sible but i will continue with an ac-
count ol things as they happened if i
am not trying your patience

  i assured him that he was not

   well i did not remonstrate with
my landlady he said taking up the
thread of his narrative  i just cleared
out to an hotel but i put up there as
 william dudley and i have not
thought of using my own name since ex-
cept to my fool of a detective and to
you the point is important to remem-
ber

   it was at the hotel a little place
near the strand that i realized first
that i was being shadowed on reach-
ing the london terminus from broad-
stairs i had casually noticed a ferrety-
looking little man with flaming red hair
waiting on the platform who seemed to
glance at me with interest and i thought
it only a coincidence when i recognized
him strolling past the house when i
quitted my apartments but when the
next m rning i caught sight of him out-
side my hotel  had no doubt that he was
keeping watch nn me and i concluded
wrongly that the police authorities
wished to keep an eye on me pending any
fresh development in the broadstairs
affair

   i was not afraid of the police but
i objected to being watched especially
when i had decided to change my name
and conceal my connection with the

dudley carton of the newspaper sensa-
tion so when i again moved into
chambers here i went to no end of
trouble to make sure that i was not fol-
lowed and i thought i had suc-
ceeded 

  carton passed a fresh cigar and
struck a match for me

   well the next thing he continued
 and this is where the mystery that
baffles me really begins  received an
anonymous letter addressed to me here
in my real name it said that the writer
had information of great personal im-
portance to give me if i could arrange to
meet her alone on the victoria bridge
between ten and eleven the same night

    found the letter in the rack in the
hall and thanked providence that it had
not been refused at the house since no
dudley carton was known there and i
took possession of it surreptitiously
when nobody was in the hall

   after consideration i decided to
keep the appointment if only through
curiosity to know how anybody had
found out where i was living for it
seemed to me that nobody could have
any news of importance to me unless
perhaps it has to do with the crime that
had thrown a shadow over my life

   so i put a revolver in my pocket in
case it might be some common robbing
fraud and was on the bridge at ten i
waited there for over the hour without
the slightest sign of a woman and was
just deciding that the letter was a hoax
of some sort when a man passing stared
at me stopped and held out his hand

     mr carton isnt it he said be-
fore i recognized him  i have often
wondered whether we should meet again
and hoped that we might are you liv-
ing in this part of london

   it was sir caleb burnham and his
friendly recognition pleased me all the
more because  had been feeling like a
pariah he ran on talking without wait-
ing for me to answer telling me that he
lived just over the bridge at battersea
had been delayed late at a board meet-
ing in the city and had failed to find
a cab at sloane street to drive him home

   he called it another intervention of
providence since it had led to our meet-
ing the striking resemblance between
us had interested him very much he
ihii packing-case



said and he had been anxious to make
my acquaintance and find out whether
there was not some relationship between
us a brother of his fathers had emi-
grated to australia some fifty years ago
and been lost sight of in any case if
there was any truth in the claims of the
physiognomists we ought to find that we
had a great many tastes in common and
he ended by asking whether i would
walk home with him

   i should not have hesitated for a mo-
ment but for my fear of missing the
writer of the anonymous letter and losing
the chance on which i had counted of
learning facts that might be of impor-
tance to me and i explained the posi-
tion to my new friend showing him the
letter sir caleb read it through in the
light of one of the bridge lamps and
quietly proceeded to tear the paper into
small pieces

   that is the only way to treat
anonymous letters he said as he let the
scraps flutter over the bridge into jhe
river  i receive hundreds of them and
treat them all alike people who wont
sign their names are always rogues and
are trying to serve themselves not to
serve you and it is a quarter past
eleven now he added glancing at his
watch  vou do not intend to wait here
all night i dare say it was merely the
trick of some thief who picked  your
name by chance and when he got you
here decided that you were a bit too
sturdy-looking to attack

   i could have told sir caleb car-
ton continued giving me another of his
diffident inquiring glances as if to ask
whether my patience was being ex-
hausted by all these details- i could
have told sir caleb that his easy explana-
tion of the letter was wrong because no
ordinary thief could be aware that dud-
ley carton was living at my address but
i did not care to discuss it i was feel-
ing ashamed of the hopes i had -allowed
myself to build on the meeting and since
my anonymous correspondent had now
plainly failed to keep the appointment
 allowed myself to be persuaded and
went on with my new friend

  he had put hiss arm jn mine and
chatted with the utmost amiability as we
walked the little way to his house an
important-looking place facing on bat-

tersea park burnham opened the door
with his latch-key and switched  the
light in the hall lie did not believe in
making slaves of his servants he told
me and his household always retired ai
eleven whether he was home or not
there was a comfortable fire which
seemed to have been very recently at-
tended to however burning in his study
and a carefully shaded oil-lamp was
alight

   the baronet made a most genial host
lie could not have laid himself out more
to be agreeable if i had come to him with
the best credentials on earth instead of
owing my introduction to my arrest for
murder and i said something of the sort

    i am sufficiently vain- he replied
to think that no credentials could be
better than your face i feel as though
 have found a twin brother and i want
to see as much of you as ever i can

   i do not think i felt any actual dis-
trust of him although the very excess of
his friendliness gave to the whole meet-
ing a sort of unreality that forbade me
to take his protestations quite seriously
he was pressing me to visit him at his
country-place in kent and spend a week
or two with him there and when i said
with ordinary politeness that i should be
very much pleased he proceeded at once
to make the invitation and my accept-
ance of it definite

   he was going down in the morning
by the first train for a few weeks holi-
day why should not  accompany him
i pleaded that i could think of nothing at
present but the clearing of my name and
that it was necessary lor me to keep in
touch with clash the private detective
but sir caleb brushed the objections
away my name did not need clearing
nobody but a fool could attach any sus-
picion to me and in a month the whole
affair would be forgotten clash was
quite incompetent-an idea i was arriv-
ing at myself-and if i was really set 
investigating he would introduce me to
the best man in england for the job

   trickett was the man for me-a veri-
table sherlock holmes-and he would
get him down to sarbury his country-
place while i was there to talk it over
with me i had no actual objections left
to offer against my hosts plan and i
was too much bewildered by his effusive-


the all-story magazine

ness lo resist him after feeling myself
such an outcast it was very pleasant to
find my company so much desired and
by a man so rich and influential

   he began to make arrangements for
our meeting early in the morning and
made me glance at my watch it was
nearly midnight

   i that gives me only six hours 
said and rose reluctantly the room
was very cozy and  was unconsciously
sleepy my host pushed me down again

  why turn out at all he said i
can easily give you a bed here do
they go to bed early at your place

   as a matter of fact they do not
the head porter never shuts the outside
door till half past twelve at the earliest
and  have wondered since whether
burnham was acquainted with the fact

     thats all right then he said when
i told him just write the man a line
and tell him you wont be back to-night
ask him to bundle all your things
into your boxes and give them to the
bearer if you take your rooms by the
week you might as well settle up with
the people it is of no use paying for
empty rooms while you are away write
the letter and i will send my secretary
across with it to bring your traps back
then we shall not stand any chance of
missing each other in the morning

   he got oul a sheet of note-paper for
me as he spoke and pushing a pen into
my hand actually dictated what i should
say before i had really thought of de-
ciding whether i wished to give up my
rooms or not  had informed the head
porter that i was staying the night with
a friend and going into the country for
an indefinite time on the morrow and
requested him to make out my bill to
the end of the week

   i had no money with me to meet it i
had thought it prudent to leave my purse
in my one portmanteau which as it hap-
pened i kept packed and ready in case
i found it necessary to change my quar-
ters at a moments notice but my host
made light of lending me the money
which would enable his secretary to set-
tle up everything for me

   but is not your secretary in bed
i asked him and he shook his head

  no diplock always sits up in
case i bring work home with me as

a matter of fact i have some for him
to do when he returns

    he took the letter and left the room
closing the door behind him i stirred
the fire lighted another cigar and
leaned back in drowsiness feeling a ra-
ther comfortable sense of satisfaction
at being taken so entirely under an
influential mans wing but i had been
so hurried along without a moment for
thought that not till  was alone did
i remember a somewhat important mis-
take i had made in my letter

   as it happened  had not had an
occasion for telling sir caleb about my
change of name and i wrote the letter
so completely under his influence that
when he had said  now your signature
carton  had written my actual name
if the mistake was not remedied the
poor secretary would only reach sartor
mansions to find that the head-porter
did not know who d carton was

    i opened the door quickly to recall
the letter

   in the hall below i could hear the
murmur of voices sir caleb was evi-
dently giving his secretary his direc-
tions and  hastened to join them but
before i was half way down the flight
i heard the hall-door close and at the
same moment the light below me was
switched off leaving me in darkness
impelled by the thought that the secre-
tary was leaving the house i hurried
on in the darkness and groped my way
to the door to open it at the same
moment sir caleb whom i had passed
in the complete darkness switched on
the light again to see what was hap-
pening

    what on earth is the matter he
asked but  was already outside the
house calling to the man who had just
left it he turned at once and as i
caught sight of him i turned suddenly
sick with apprehension

   sir caleb burnhams secretary was
the ferrety little man with flaming red
hair whom i had seen  shadowing me
when i first reached town

   i have wondered since carton con-
tinued after waiting to see whether i
was properly impressed by the sensa-
tionalism of the fact he had just given
me  i have wondered since why i took
alarm so instantly and felt all at once
the packing-case



that the house was a trap which  could
not enter again at any price

   of course when you comc to reason
it out calmly  was justified i think in
feeling uneasy if it was burnham who
had been having me shadowed he must
have had some greater object than the
mere interest he pretended to take in me
on account of our likeness and after
having taken the trouble to have ma
shadowed it was not likely that he would
owe his meeting with me to chance it
was more probable that he had written
me the anonymous letter with the sole
purpose of getting me to his house with-
out even his servants knowing that we
had met

   it looks suspicious all round when
one considers it but what surprises
me now is that i should have jumped
to all these deductions straight off with-
out reasoning for a moment and be in
a terror to get clear of the place burn-
ham had followed me out quickly and
already had his arm in mine the secre-
tary stood between us and the street
staring and really wondering i believe
which of us was his employer and i
conquered the inclination to pull out my
revolver and fight for my freedom the
shock had steadied me and made me
quite cool and resourceful

  what on earth is the matter
burnham was asking me again

  	only that i was sending your secre-
tary on a fools errand  said and ex-
plained about my name

   burnham seemed relieved

    well you can soon write the letter
again he said and i reentered the hall
with him but as i reached the rack
where my hat and overcoat were hang-
ing i stopped

    i think after all i had better go
mvself i said  there are two or three
things lying about that they might forget
to pack and i am sure to get a cab on
the embankment it will save me
troubling about breakfast and being
wakened in the morning if you dont
mind my coming back to you to sleep

   i believe i spoke quite easily and
left my friend satisfied that  should
come back to him but i did not go
back

   i wrote him a polite note instead
regretting that i had found a telegram

awaiting me which prevented my ac-
cepting his kind invitation you see i
was quite uncertain whether  had
escaped a deep laid plot or was making
a fool of myself by distrusting the only
man who had offered me any hospitality
since  landed in england i am not
sure yet and that is the great problem
i want you to solve for me mr her-
bert

  dudley carton leaned back in his
chair and waited as if i were an oracle
for my answer

   i should say i answered trying
hard to be oracular  especially after
what i have seen to-night that you did
well to give sir caleb a wide berth his
evident effort to prepare the people here
for your disappearance and prevent
them making inquiries about you if you
never returned looks very sinister if
you had spent the night in the house at
battersea there seems a fair possibility
that it would have been your last

   that is what i think he said quite
pleased by my indorsement of his suspi-
cion  but why even given that he
killed the man at broadstairs what
could he possibly hope to do or gain by
my death that is what baffles me

  it baffled me too but i did not care
to say so

   please go on with your story 
said instead  i should like to hear
more-especially what happened to you
to-night to take you to tedworth street
and make you try one of the garden
doors there

chapter v

the christian com pan y-promotlu

   the next day said dudley carton
continuing his story  i had a visit from
diplock the secretary he said that sir
caleb had been disappointed when i did
not return but had congratulated him-
self afterward when he found that he
too was unable to get away from town
he was hoping that i would let him
know when i was free and that we could
still manage to get away together

   i could see that he was very anxious
to know whether my excuse was a pre-
tended one and i did not take any great
pains to make it appear genuine
especially when he went on to say that


the all-story magazine

sir caleb was likely to be busy in the
city late for the nest few days but
would be glad if i could call in for a
chat again when he was at home after
eleven at night

    i answered politely and indefinitely
i was very determined not to go near the
house overlooking battersea park again
and i did not care whether diplock and
his master guessed the fact or not but
i was still quite uncertain whether i
was making a fool of myself by feeling
any queer sensation about my visit and
i did not want to lose sir calebs friend-
ship if it was a bona tide one i was
quite ready to meet any advances that
he cared to make in an ordinary open
manner bat i may say that he has
made none

    in the fortnight that has passed since
our meeting on the victoria bridge he
has never called on me or written to me
he has never invited me to his house
except for an hour when the household
would be asleep he has never asked
me to meet him in the city and all
the time i have had that man diplock
meeting me near here as if by accident
and telling me how anxious sir caleb
was to see me and twice i have met
burnham himself in the same way at
night and he has tried hard to get me
to go home with him

   now what do you make of it mr
herbert i confess that i cant think
what it means and it has got on my
nerves i have thought of course of
leaving these apartments and changing
my name again but my curiosity wont
let me i want to avoid danger but i
want more to know whether there is any
danger to avoid

   that is why i said that for some
things i s ould be glad to hear that
burnham is dead if he has really com-
mitted suiyide i suppose my danger is
at an end hut i should almost feel sorry
if it means that i am never to under-
stand what he really wanted with me es-
pecially if it interferes with my chance
of ever clearing up the broadstairs
affair t do not know whether you agree
with me but i feel as though that is
finally at the bottom of it all what do
you think mr herbert

  i did not offer an opinion although

i	would not have admitted it for worlds

to the man who was appealing to me
with such pathetic dependenre i was
simply bewildered by the strange story
he had told me

   you have not obtained any due to
the broadstairs murder which it would
be worth the actual murderers while to
suppress   asked

  he shook his head

   not a scrap of a clue i have not
made any inquiries at all because  know
it is not in my line i have not any of
your wonderful deductive powers mr
herbert and i have left it entirely in
my detectives hands if he has found
out anything-and he seems a complete
fool at the business-i would be clash
and not me that the murderer would
want to silence now can you see why
burnham-

  i	most decidedly could not see and i
interrupted him

  but about to-night i said hoping
that the affair would show some light
when we got to the mystery of the pack-
ing-case and were able to supplement
dudley cartons story with mine

  ii	oh to-night he said  i had
another letter from my anonymous
friend by the last post addressed to me
this time in my assumed name to make
sure that i should receive it i suppose
she began by apologizing for her failure
to meet me on the bridge and explained
that she was in hiding from the police
and that they had made it impossible
for her to leave her hiding-place or com-
municate with me till now -

   and she said outright that she knew
i wanted to solve the mystery of the
broadstairs murder and that she could
give me the whole account of the affair
for a five-pound note if i would meet
her with the money at a spot where she
would be safe from the watchful eyes
of the police a spot temptingly close
to me

  in tedworth street i inquired
and he stared at me

   how do you know

   i met you first there i said  pay-
ing  particular attention to a certain
house on the north side

   the thirteenth said carton  i
was to go there at twelve oclock precise-
ly knock twice at the garden door and
open it my informant would be wait-
the packing-case	

                          

ing to discuss the broadstairs affair it
was tempting yojj know fishy a it all
sounded i was strongly inclined to
keep the appointment as i had kept the
appointment on the bridge i have not
the least certainty you know that burn-
ham had really anything to do with the
first letter

   he had with the second i said
with certainty  but please go on you
did not keep the appointment

   carton reddened slightly as he shook
his head

   no i got in a complete fright as the
time drew near and i dared not venture
outside the house i ought of course to
have kept watch on the place but-well
-i turned coward and i dared not go
out for a couple of hours even to look
at the place it was then that i met
you and when i saw you follow me
home i got a fit of the nerves again it
was not till i saw you pass again with a
policeman in uniform that my curiosity
got the upper hand and i made up my
mind to seeif you had anything to tell
me and here we are as a consequence
now what have you to tell me 

   only that if you had kept the ap-
pointment you would probably have been
struck down and killed as you entered
the garden i said  that your dead
body would have been put in a packing-
case and wheeled by sir caleb burnham
across the bridge to bis house at batter-
sea i suppose

    as you did not turn up his confed-
erate filled the bos with bricks to give it
the weight required put a little blood
on it to persuade sir caleb that the crime
was committed contrary to his expecta-
tion sir caleli was stopped on the way
and nnagmingthai your dead body was
in the case jumped into the river to
avoid arrest and was drowned

  and i told him my story to prove my
hypothesis

  dudley carton heard me through in
silence and nodded his head when  had
finished

   that is clear enough i have felt
all along of course that burnham never
meant me to leave his liouse alive the
night he got me there and that is why
he wanted my affairs to be settled up
here so that the people of the house
wuld not think of making inquiry about

     	s

me when i disappeared he found that
he could not get me to the house alive
without anybody knowing  had gone
there so he sqhemed to take me there
dead

   but why mr herbert that is
what i want you to tell me what on
earth was it for that i what i want
you to tell me as i suppose you can

when you have such wonderful-

and he said kind and wholly mistaken
things about my detective ability again

  they irritated me a little carton
was regarding me with his pathetic air
of perfect confidence as if he had man-
aged at last to get the penny in the slot
and had only to open the drawer of my
mind and take out the complete solution
of all that had puzzled him

  and the solution was not there i
knew only what he knew that there had
been a very deliberate and cunning at-
tempt on his life but the reason for it
which he confidently expected me to
tell him simply because i have written
a few ingenious detective stories was as
far from my understanding as his

  but i hated to say so and i rose from
my chair to pace the floor as t always
do when i have a knotty point in a
story to work out i had long ceased to
think of the revolver in my pocket and
i gave  the broadstairs murderer as i
had called him in my mind when we
entered the house full opportunity to
take me unawares if he wished

  but he only watched me with an al-
most reverential expectancy for the re-
sult of my thinking i had stopped at
the uncurtained window unconsciously
and from the embankment below me
came the sound of a rapidly driven cab
which stopped at the house

   heres somebody stopping i said
 perhaps they have brought us the ex-
planation

  looking back at the affair afterward it
seems to me that it was the only thing i
contributed in the whole affair to justify
dudky cartons faith in me

  he had given his mind up to my
leadership sufficiently to take- the words
quite seriously and he hurried down to
open the hall-door while i followed for
want of anything better to do wonder-
ing how i shoufd maintain my reputa-
tion when he discovered that it was only


the am-story magazine

one of the inmate of the house return-
ing from a night out

  as a matter of fact it was a messen-
ger from charing cross hospital who
wanted  mr william dudley or  mr
dudley carton whichever he cared to
call himself to accompany him post
haste to satisfy the urgent wish of a
dying man-a man called diplock

  diplock had made an attempt the
messenger explained to board the tidal
express for dover and the continent as
it was leaving charing cross station
he had made a frantic rush for the
moving train and impeded by a heavy
bag in his hand had fallen and been
drawn under the guards van he was
terribly injured and there was no hope
of his recovery but now after lying for
four hours insensible in the hospital he
had awakened to full consciousness and
begged urgently that mr carton might
be sent for

  one would scarcely believe it but
carton seemed uncertain whether to go
to him he had been driven into such
a nervous state by the mysterious efforts
of this man diplock and his employer
to get him into their power that i be-
lieve he was still doubtful whether this
was not only a trap set for him he
looked at me quite appealingly

   you will come with me wont vou
mr herbert

   what do you think  i retorted
 hurry up he may be dead before
we hear what he has to say

  i	pushed him impatiently forward and
in another moment we were all three
crowded into the hansom and the driver
was urging his horse to its full speed
again we were too tightly packed-
for carton is a big man-for anything
like easy conversation but the messen-
ger told us in answer to a query of mine
that diplock knew his hack was broken
-it was his most serious injury-and
that there was no hope for him

  and he volunteered on his own ac-
count the information that the hand-bag
which was largely responsible for the ac-
cident had flown open on the line and let
out a shower of bank-notes and gold
more than ten thousand pounds had been
counted by the railway officials who
had gathered it up and there was quite
as much left in the bag the messenger

had an idea i think that it had been
stolen from carton and that diplock
stopped in his intended flight of the
continent with it by the accident was
going to make confession to the man
he had robbed but he did not find us
communicative and we drove to the
hospital practically in silence

  and at the hospital  was met by
the most exasperating incident of a
night that had not been without its
trials of patience  had taken it for
granted that  should hear what dip-
lock had to say if he was still able to
say anything carton was anxious for
me to accompany him to the accident
ward but it appeared i could not enter
because of some stupid red-tape rule of
the institution against which i pitted
my eagerness to hear diplocks disclos-
ures in vain

   was not a relative of the injured
man and he had not asked to see me
i could not even pretend that he wished
to see me so the laws of the medes
and persians had decided long ago that
i must not step beyond the waiting-room
and there  remained for an hour that
was as long as all the rest of the event-
ful night put together

  i	believe that  paced up and down it
the whole time till carton appeared
again his face a little white and drawn
but with all the nervous restlessness that
had characterized it gone

  ii	well that is all over he said
quietly

   he is dead 

   no they think he may last an hour
or two more but all the danger and
uncertainty that has been driving me
silly is at anend now he has told me
the whole plot he did not know that
sir caleb burnham was dead and he said
that he wanted to ease his mind by
putting me on my guard against him
but on my soul i believe that he really
told me because he was so proud of the
plot and did not want its cleverness to
le unrecognized

   he was just as keen on making his
confession when i told him that burn-
ham had committed suicide and he
wanted me to take possession of the
thirty thousand pounds he had in his
bag and keep half as a return for seeing
that the other half got to a sister of his
the packing-cask



in edinburgh of course it will have to
go back to burnhams estate and help
meet his liabilities diplock puts them
at over a million

   but i can tell you everything as we
walk home you dont mind walking
we can talk better and i have a lot to
tell you the fellow was perfectly
conscious and clear painfully so for a
man who knows that he has not six
hours at the utmost before him and he
seemed keen on unbosoming himself

  the hours pause had enabled me to
realize that i was physically about
fagged out but carton seemed anxious
to walk and i was ready tired as i was
to do much more than that distance to
chelsea to hear the solution of the
mystery

  london was already beginning to be-
stir itself as we stepped out into the
street ft was dark still but a passing
milkmans cart served as the first re-
minder that it was no longer night but
the beginning of a new day

   i think the broadstairs crime will
be cleared up sufficiently to clear my
name and allow me to see bleak
house after all carton began as
we linked arms and fell into step
and i did not blame him for thinking
firstly how the disclosures he had heard
would affect himself

   what diplock has tokl me is not
evidence i suppose and i nearly choked
him off altogether by suggesting to have
somebody sent for to make it a sworn
statement bt he says the facts are
bound to come out when murgatroyds
brother in australia hears of the affair
that is what made sir caleb in such a
hurry to get things settled

   then it was burnham who threw
murgatroyd over the cliff  i asked im-
patiently

   yes sir caleb burnham baronet
appears to be about the most colossal
hypocrite and impostor of the century
and it does not make me particularly
comfortable to know that i have a face
like his but if it proved that i have
his character latent in me it would prove
too that id got his brains and it is a
dead certainty that i havent

   his companies are all part of one
big swindle which each new one has
helped to support and he has gone on

blowing the bubble bigger and bigger
till it was ready to burst he was ma-
king preparations to save himself when
the burst came but murgatroyd turned
up before his preparations were com-
plete murgatroyd and his brother had
been partners with him in an undis-
covered swindle in the beginning of his
career and had emigrated

   they did badly and when they were
on their beam ends it occurred to them
that they might make money out of
burnham by threatening to show up the
whole scandal the one who was killed
came across for the purpose and arrived
at a moment when the bubble was near
bursting and it needed only a suspicion
to bring about the catastrophe burn-
ham pretended to treat with him and
made himself very agreeable invited
him down to his place in kent and took
him in his motor-car with diplock
driving he took him down to the coast
deliberately and got him out there on the
pretence that the motor had broken down
and that they must find somebody to
repair it

   then the quarrel came and murga-
troyd was thrown over the cliff that be-
ing the easiest way to dispose of him
when burnham got rid of the fisher-
man who tried to secure him he ran back
to the waiting motor and they were in
town again before midnight but fancy
the nerve of the fellow he no sooner
reported himself in town with a view
to a possibly required alibi than he
caught the midnight train back to the
neighborhood of the crime to get the
first news if anything threatened to in-
criminate him

   diplock who lent himself to every
crime seemed overwhelmed by admira-
tion of his masters cleverness and audac-
ity and i believe he is dying happy
because at the end lie managed to go
one better than his idol and cheat the
cheater

   but you are wondering why they
paid so much attention to me mr her-
bert well diplock says the idea was
his and i believe his pride in it made
him tell me all about it sir calebs
idea of meeting the cyclone which would
gather round him wherr the bubble at last
burst was to pretend suicide he had
managed to secure about one hundred


the ai i -stor v i  agazn e

thousand pounds in cash and untraceable
notes and his idea was to leave a sui-
cides letter in his room and his hat and
coat on the edge of the river to satisfy
public opinion while he disguised him-
self and commenced life anew some-
where under another identity

   the weak point of the scheme was
that it was too ostensible the public
he had gulled would want better evi-
dence that he was really dead before
they would relinquish their efforts to
find and punish him that is where i
and my wonderful resemblance came in
when sir caleb hurried up to town with
the news of my arrest and discharge
diplock saw the possibilities at a
glance and he has never lost sight of me
since you see the idea of course

   when the public which the  chris-
tian company-promoter  had hood-
winked for so long discovered how he
had cheated them nothing but the sight
of his dead body would satisfy them
that his pretended suicide was anything
more than another of his tricks i was
to supply the dead body to make his
escape complete on the night that i
was lured into his house without a soul
beyond burnham diplock and myself
knowing that we had ever met in
london the thing was to be done

   as soon as diplock had returned
with my luggage and made sure that
the people at sartor mansions would
not make inquiries about me when i
disappeared i was to be offered burn-
hams own rooms as soon as i had
undressed he would come in to press a
last drink  me and that last drink
would transform me from the living
dudley carton into the dead body of
sir caleb burnham fpr the servants to
discover in the morning

    what difference there is in our faces
and i do flatter myself that i have a
different expression at any rate-would
be wiped out by death and for the mat-
ter of that who ever thinks of examining
the face or body of a man found dead
in his own bed to make sure that it is
really-he

   burnham would have had the rest
of the night to write his farewell letter
appropriate my clothes and start off into
the world with the hundred thousand
pounds and a new identity the original

idea had been for him to return to my
rooms in my clothes spend the rest of
the night there and settle up my bill
as though he were myself in the morning
but the noticeable difference in our
voices as well as my readiness to agree
to anything he proposed made him alter
itis design while be talked to me fortu-
nately for me

   if he had not i should not be alive
now well they found out that my
suspicions were aroused sufficiently to
make me avoid burnhams house and
every day the bursting of the bubble
became more imminent so they had to
satisfy themselves with a plan more
dangerous and clumsy if i would not
go to burnhams house they must dis-
pose of me at some quiet spot where i
would go and make arrangements for
getting my body to the house when i
was dead

   they selected the garden of an
empty house belonging to burnham
thinking it would be near enough to my
own rooms to tempt me and diplock
wrote another anonymous letter to get
me there burnham was trying to throw
the whole burden on his accomplices
shoulders he kept his hold on diplock
by promising him a third of his haul
after he had made his escape but the
little man did not want to be left in the
lurch if anything went wrong he was
willing to wait for me in the dark garden
and shoot me down with an air-pistol as
i entered he considers himself to be
an unfailing shot but sir caleb must
take the risk of getting the corpse back
to the house

    diplock would finish the long record
of dirty work he had done for his master
by committing a murder but it was the
last stroke he would do after that he
must think of saving himself and for
that he would want his money burn-
ham had to accept the bargain diplock
was to kill me and receive his thirty
thousand pounds when he handed over
my dead body for the other man to
dispose of at his own risk and dip-
lock swears he meant to keep the bar-
gain

    it was not till he realized hat i was
not coming and an unfortunate cat got
on his nerves by raising an unearthly
caterwaul in the garden as if intent on
the celestial perfume



waking up everybody in the neighbor-
hood and made him shoot it that it
occurred to him to fool his confederate
and get his money at any cost

   the packing-case had been carted
into the garden two days earlier and lay
waiting with the lid and screws all ready
and diplock set tu work like a maniac
to ill it up with earth and stones think-
ing every moment that burnham would
be on the spot to spoil his stratagem
but the last screw was in when he heard
the truck approaching and met burnham
at the gate with the announcement that
the affair had succeeded perfectly

   burnham was horribly nervous al-
though he had wheeled the truck all the
way from his house without meeting a
soul and he got more nervous still when
he saw the blood on the case when he
found how heavy it was he wanted dip-
lock to help him but diplock had got his
money and kept him to his bargain

   they were disputing about it when
you turned the corner of- the street and
put an end to their talk as soon as you
had passed on diplock hurried to char-
ing cross station with his thirty thou-
sand pounds to try and catch the tidal
express and met with what i suppose
was just retribution you will come in 

  to my surprise we were back already
at sartor mansions and around us on the
embankment lay the gray light of dawn

   i rather think that it is time i was
going to bed i said and he walked on
with me to the door of my own chambers
thanking me again without the least
suspicion of irony i am sure for the
immense amount of help i had given
him in solving the mystery

  when he left me  found myself al-
most too tired and sleepy to get up to my
room and undress and i slept straight
away for a solid twelve hours i might
probably have slept longer but of the
many callers whom my man turned away
through the day one george malcolm
of the times considered himself suf-
ficiently intimate to decide that twelve
hours sleep was enough for anybody

  i woke as he entered my bedroom
bristling with newspapers

   look here old man he said
havent you looked at the papers yet 
i sat up rubbing my eyes

   what have the papers got hold of
it already i said and malcolm stared

 already he laughed why
every paper this morning had a glowing
account of it and the  evenings  are out
now following suit with if possible
more enthusiasm they all agree that
it is a big success

  he was talking about my play

  yet although nobody will believe me
any more than malcolm did i had for-
gotten all about it

how a man for cruelty and
falsehood was repaid a thou-
sandfold in the wages of sin

t was after dinner and the men were
smoking in a small red room off the
dining-room they had been talk-
ing of a monstrous inexplicable
rime which had staggered humanity
ml which had left its print on every

ones mind the story had just been
told with all its gruesome details and
the five men were digesting it with twist-
ed faces as after a bad draft

  finally the youngest man spoke

   there is an explanation to every-
thing he said  everything no mat-
ter how strange or mysterious it be has
perhaps the simplest explanation 

  he paused to relight his cigarette and
then lifted his eyes to the faces of the
men around him

   perhaps the doctor does not agree
	the all-story magazine

with you ore of the men suggested
noticing the thoughtful look on the mans
face

   yes the doctor returned  i do i
believe that statement is true i think
almost everything has an explanation
 say almost because once or twice things
occur in the lives of men which seem so
closely associated with the supernatural
so interwoven with mystery that it ap-
pears impossible to account for them by
natural means

   you talk as if sue a thing had oc-
curred in your life the first man said

  the doctor took a long pull at his
cigar then continued

    had an experience once that i
could not unravel and that has puzzled
me to this day it came near bring-
ing me to the murderers dock and yet
the explanation given at the time seemed
to have satisfied all those who heard it
but to me it was insufficient there was
something lacking if you wish  will
tell it to you

  several of the men spoke at once

   do so by all means they said

  after a short pause the doctor began

   it was some time ago just after the
civil war in  i was then serving
as a resident in the pencoyd hospital
at that time there were three of us who
lived in the hospital-alfred jordan
francis dalphine and myself alfred
jordan this story does not concern
francis dalphine however i wish to
describe to you as he was one of the
principals in the events i am about to
relate

   he was from new orleans and con-
tained in his appearance that mixture of
the french and southern blood which is
so characteristic

  in person he was lean and long with
a swarthy delicate face a broad rather
bulging brow and jet-black curling hair
a good-looking fellow enough save for
a peculiar leer about his mouth-corners
this man was to me particularly dis-
tasteful and i never saw good qualities
and bad ones so sadly mixed

   his habits were loose and coarse to
a degree yet his desires were withheld
with that modicum of prudence which
keeps a man from inconvenient drunk-
enness or discovered theft pie wore an
easy air nf tolerance and self-assurance

due perhaps to the consciousness of his
own mental ability which was marked
for his mind was fine and clear though
unclean

   he had an especial turn for surgery
and his longing for knowledge in this
branch of medicine burned with the same
furious flame as his baser desires and
was only quenched when his object was
secured it was this desire-this at-
tempt-to satisfy his surgical curiosity
regardless of consequences that led to the
tragedy i am about to relate

   it seems that late one night just
after my arrival at the hospital two
chinamen walked into the receiving
ward one was suffering from a bad
cold the other acted as interpreter
dalphine had given the sick man some
medicine or other and was about to send
him away when he noticed a lump on
his arm large enough to be seen through
the loose coat the chincman wore

   lie made the man disrobe and found
a tumor on the arm near the shoulder
through the interpreter he insisted that
the chinaman spend the night in the
hospital

  in the morning he asked me to ex-
amine the arm with him i was sur-
prised at the appearance of the china-
man he was evidently of the upper
class and not the low-caste coolie that

i	expected to see his face was intelli-
gent his clothes were the finest quality
of silk and he had the long uncut fin-
ger-nails which in that race denote lux-
ury and freedom from work a fine
gold chain hung around his neck and a
massive gold ring of curious design
adorned one of his fingers

   he bared his arm and i examined
it carefully the tumor was a large
one and seemed firmly attached i
thought it was a cancerous growth and
told dalphine so and asked him if he
had suggested an operation

    that is why i sent for you he ex-
plained  i need help to get his con-
sent you see its a good operation and
if i work it right i can do it myself

-	  but its an amputation i said
will smith let you do it

  now mind you dalphine re-
turned  i am telling nothing to smith
this is my case and i do it myself you
keep your mouth shut do you see
the celestial perfume



   i was green and timid and awed by
dalphines manner so said nothing

    now go aliead said dalpliine
 and explain to them what has to be
done i have already told them but
i think you can clinch the matter

   i turned to the interpreter and told
him at some length the dangerous con-
dition the man was in-how an opera-
tion would have to he performed and
how death would ensue if it was refused

   this was transmitted rapidly to the
patient who received it in silence fi-
nally he spoke shortly and the interpre-
ter turned to me

  he wishes to know if he loses his
arm

   dalpliine heard the question pull-
ing me aside he exchanged a sharp look

    these heathens he whispered
 have a belief that if their arms or legs
are taken off before death they will ap-
pear in hell or heaven without them
now i want you to tell this man that
we can take this tumor off without his
arm of course if anything happens
at the operation that makes amputation
necessary we can tell him afterward

    but it seems to me i said sharply
 that this will he necessary the tumor
so involves the bone that i do not think
it can he removed without the arm

    you wont tell him that  dalphine
said quickly

    i cant honestly tell him anything
else i replied  besides that you
should let smith see him

   no i will not dalphine returned

	smith is a blundering old woman and

i	intend doing this myself if you are
going to mix things up you had better
not tell the chinaman anything

    very veil i said angrily  do
as you please

  	and with that i left him

   i did not find out till the next day
what arrangements dalphine had made
he sent for me to etherize and i found
the chinaman and the interpreter in a
small room off the operating-chamber
before i began the chinaman sent for
dalghine who came with sleeves rolled
up arubber apron on andfiis hands cov-
ered with soap-suds

  what is it dalphine said look-
ing at me i pointed to the interpreter
who spoke

    he says you promised not to take
off his arm because he says he would
rather die than lose his arm

    all right dalphine said hurriedly
and turned to go

   the sick man rose up in bed caught
dalphine by the arm and rattled a few
sentences to the interpreter who again
spoke to dalphine

    he wishes you to promise on vour
god

    all right dalphine said looking
at me with his peculiar leer  i prom-
ise on my god

   this was told the chinaman who
sank back apparently satisfied

  to say  was disgusted with the
whole affair was but putting it mildly
and yet it was dalphines concern and
not mine he was my senior and to
him i believed all the blame belonged
since that time  have thought i should
have interfered and told the chinaman
what would probably happen hut i did
not

    had some trouble in getting the
chinaman to take the anesthetic but his
friend and i finally persuaded him
the smell of the ether was to me a re-
lief for the chinaman had about him a
peculiar musk-like perfume that per-
meated the room and was very unpleas-
ant

   the operation was done well i
have seldom seen one done with more
despatch or more skilfully when dal-
phine found by an incision where the
tumor went spreading its ramifications
into muscles and the very bone itself he
did not hesitate but looking at me
asked how the patient was doing i
answered that he was all right

    then he said  this arm comes off
at the shoulder

   i paled over the ether

    surely you cannot do this thing
after your promise i said  much bet-
ter let him die

    this arm comes off at the shoulder
he repeated and that was all while i
continued to ply the ether with repul-
sion in my heart for so vile a beast
knowing well that if i threw down the
towel and refused to continue he would
press the orderly into my place with per-
haps disastrous results

   at last it was over the severed


hi- ail-story magazine

arm was slipped in a jar of alcohol for
dalphine to examine at leisure and the
poor devil placed in his bed

  never shall  forget the chinaman
after the operation he was heavy with
ether all the afternoon hut toward night
he became gradually conscious and anx-
ious to know the result of the operation
 happened to be in the ward when his
friend was asking dalphine about it and
from a point of vantage by an alcove
could take in the whole scene without
being observed

  the chinaman his green face im-
movable as a statue had been propped
up slightly with a pillow and the quick
glances from his rat-like eyes at dal-
phine were the only evidence he gave
of any agitation bluntly and cruelly
dalphine told how at the operation the
arm had been taken off i could hear
his loud but rounded voice roll through
the ward and then to make matters
worse he said that the growth was a
cancer and that the chinaman would
probably die

  	this was interpreted to the china-
man and i watched his face as he re-
ceived it his expression did not change
but he gave the surgeon a look of such
intense hatred and loathing as i have
never seen and which made dalphine
pale beneath his dusky skin

   the evening of that day dalphine
was off duty and alfred jordan having
left the hospital on account of sickness
it fell to my lot to see the chinaman
he seemed to be in good shape and gave
no evidence of the pain which he must
have been suffering he had not changed
his position and his face wore the same-
rigid impenetrable expression

   before leaving the ward as i was
giving some directions to the nurse the
man in the next bed called to me

     doctor he said  cant you move
that chinaman out of here he smells
like a drug-store and makes me sick

    he is annoying all the patients
the nurse said  they have complained
continually since he has been in the ward
of that offensive perfume we could
move him into the end room she sug-
gested  there is no one there

   i agreed to her proposal and left
the ward for the night

     toward one oclock received a note

from the nurse saying that the chinaman
was doing badly and would  see him
i hurriedly dressed and went to the ward

   the nurse met me in the hall out-
side of the end room site told me that
a short time before she had gone to the
chinamans bed to give him some milk
he looked all right perhaps a trifle
paler but his eyes seemed lifelike and his
expression had not changed it was only
when she tried to rouse him that she
discovered something was wrong he
was not breathing and his pulse had
disappeared

    went to the bed with her and
found as she had surmised that the chi-
naman was dead lifting the bedclothes
 discovered that the mattress was soaked
with blood when i examined the mans
shoulder i found that the bandages had
all been pulled away and a ligature torn
from the main artery

   the chinaman had worked the
dressings off loosened a ligature and
quietly bled to death  gave some di-
rections in regard to the removal of the
body and started for bed as  was
leaving the ward i encountered dal-
phine who was evidently quite intoxi-
cated

  how are things he asked me
thickly steadying himself against the
door

    that chinaman of yours is dead
i answered shortly  i have just seen
him

   he said nothing but went stagger-
ing into the ward

   as i was undressing  heard him
come blundering down the hall and go
to his room

  presently he called me

     preston come in here a moment

   he was sitting on a chair in front
of the bureau when i entered and as he
faced me i saw that something had
shaken him the hush of the alcohol
had left his face he was as white as
paper

    preston he began  that damned
chinaman bit me

     bit you  i cried staring into his
bloodshot eyes

     yes bit me he repeated

   he clumsily unraveled a handker-
chief about his hand and held it to my
face two fingers were running blood
    youre a good diagnostician he
mumbled  i wen ia to see him when
i left you and was examining the shoul-
der when i knocked the candle over
while i was hunting for i- in the dark
i stack my hand in his face and he
bit me like a dog

    xoosense i said it isnt pos-
sible the mar is dead

   youre right preston he said stu-
pidly  he is dead now at any rate 
beat him over the head till he let go

    dalphine youre drunk i re-
marked  you had better go to bed
you rut your hand n something

  - i know im drunk- he muttered

	but pfeston he bit me i know that
too

   he rabbed his hand over his mouth
ard suddenly tc-ok it away nd looked
at it

    god i smell like a sachet powder
well good night here goes for bed

   he attempted to get up from the
chair slipped and fell fiat on the
ground where he lay breathing heavily
i dragged him on to his bed loosened his
collar and removed his shoes but be-
fore leaving the room i untied his hand

   on two fingers were deep and bleed-
ing indentations of human teeth

   the next day he was about his work
a- usual i asked him how his hand
was and he replied that he had cut it
on something the night before but made
no mention of the bite nor did i attempt
to question him further

    xo one came to claim the body of
the chinaman his friend who acted
a- interpreter was never seen again so
he wa- buried in the potters field

   it chanced that one night not long
afterward i went to the museum where
the specimens were preserved to examine
a thoracic aneurism which i had been
dissecting

   the museum in those days occu-
pied the basement of an old house which
was apart from the hospital in the midst
of a clump of trees to one comer of the
grounds the upper part of this house
had been used formerly t-- isolate con-
tagious casts but had long since been
abandoned on account of the dilapi-
dated condition of the walls and the
impossibility of heating the upper story

   it was a fine frosty night in decem-

ber with a thin bright moonlight and
a sharp wind which buffeted the small
lantern i carried and had swept the
brick pavements as clean as a ballroom
door i entered the building and turn-
ing locked the door firmly behind me
for on other occasions i had had some
street-prowlers vault the low fence
around the grounds open the door and
watch me with morbid curiosity

   the museum was a large room di-
vided by a long case of shelves which
extended from ceiling to floor across the
-enter of the room leaving just enough
space at each end for passageways this
case was filled with specimens as were
the shelves lining the sides the r
 ne of these shelves was protected wit
a hinged glass cover fastened with a
padlock and was the only place where
specimens were secure from the meddle-
some medical students who studied there-
at times

   after i had placed the lantern on
the table at the end of the room and
lighted a amp i unlocked the shelf
which held my specimen there were
eight or ten jars on this shelf ea rh con-
taining some portion of -he human anat-
omy preserved in alcohol among them
i recognized the arm of the chinaman
which dalphine had placed there for ex-
amination

  the fingers with their long nai
were curled up over the palm and 
noticed with surprise that the g id ring
still encircled the swollen finger and
glittered through the jar in the lamp-
light

    brought out my specimen placed
it on the table and started to work

   i dont know why it was but i was
unsuccessful i could not get my mind
on the task  had been then- perhaps
an hour when i felt the room grow cold
and a mast of chill air came sweeping
around the case of shelves taking a
lantern i advanced from the table and
discovered to my amazement tiat the
door was wide open

   you can judge of my surprise ior
i was positive that i had i eked v r
me when  entered this time h-w-
ever i closed it again but did not j 
it a-  had left my keys m the pad  k
of the specimen-cast as i turned from
the door i was conscious - a pecul ar


the all-story magazine

smell subtle at first it became more
pronounced as i returned to the table
then suddenly i recognized it-the sin-
gular musk-like odor the chinaman had
borne before death

   i was not easily frightened in those
days but i must confess i felt a creep-
ing chill crawl through my bones and a
weight of utterly causeless alarm grip
me by the heart i placed myself again
at the table attempted to work and tried
to banish the sensation of fear which was
pervading me but all to no purpose
this constant pungent smell made me
uncomfortable and to add to it i had
an odd subjective sensation accompanied
by a sinking of the pulse that there was
somebody in the room with me

   this idea became so firm so con-
vincing that i felt sure that the thing
whatever it was was behind the case
which threw its shadow blackly on the
floor it was as if something had gath-
ered there-something i had great rea-
son to fear some peculiar thing that
would harm me how or why i could not
tell

   i endeavored to reason off my nerv-
ousness  i endeavored to believe that
much if not all of what i felt was due
to the oppressive influence of the gloomy
room the isolated building and the hour
of thenight but the more i struggled
the more panic-stricken i became and
had to restrain myself by a strong force
of will from grasping the lantern and
rushing from the building during this
struggle against my fears i sat staring
at the table with the sweat running down
my face and neck overpowered with hor-
ror unaccountable yet unendurable

   the very fact that there was nothing
tangible to frighten me i think added
to my terror for if i had seen or heard
anything it would have relieved the ten-
sion

   finally i did hear something-a
faint tinkle a soft click of steel striking
steel i looked to where the sound came
from and saw as plainly as i see your
faces the keys in the locked case turn-
ing-

   the tension broke like a snapped
wire and i rushed to the case and pulled
them from the lock i imagined they
were held from me by a soft force as
if some one had a finger in the key-ring

and was gently restraining me from ta-
king them  jammed them in my pock-
et and taking the lamp went around
the case the golden rays illuminated
thoroughly the space beyond the case

    there was nothing there but  no-
ticed that the smell here was stronger
and i had a sensation of nausea from it
as i had had the day of the operation i
blew out the lamp and holding the lan-
tern on high fled from the building

    the cold night-air settled me some-
what but i could not shake off the sen-
sation that the thing had followed me
and looked back time and again to re-
assure myself

   that night  could not sleep for
some time but tossed about with a troub-
led mind while the hours waned away
i had received a shock that seemed en-
tirely disproportionate to actual occur-
rences and one that had shaken my
nerves badly the death of the china-
man and the thought which i know will
seem foolish to you that he was seeking
his lost arm kept running through my
mind

    finally toward morning i fell into
a disturbed sleep half asleep  thought
a figure entered my room i called to
it thinking it was dalphine but re-
ceived no answer again i smelled the
musty odor and attempted to awaken my-
self for the insidious perfume was cho-
king me the figure went to the table
and i heard the rattle of the keys as
they were turned as i imagined in an
effort to remove one from the ring i
awoke with a cry and found dalphine
standing by my bed

   dawn was making things plain in
my room and dalphine with blue shad-
ows about his mouth looked wan and
ghastly in the faint light of the two
of us he looked the more frightened

     whats the matter with you   he
asked did you call did you see
anything 

     no i said collecting myself  
had a dream thats all

   he went to the window and opened

 it

      its awful close in here he said
whats that sickening smell

 i could smell it too as the fresh
air from the window drove it tpward me
  it was in my room last night he
the celestial perfume

   said turning from the window  and
   say preston lie said irritably before lie
   left me  if you have any more dreams
   dont make so much noise about them

      after that night the ordinary pro-
   cession of events in the hospital under-
   went a change-everything seemed to go
   wrong something strange  was about
   and  had a queer feeling of foreboding
   which i have heard precedes a calamity
   we began to lose case after case without
   apparent cause and if there was a chance
   for the most benign disease to become
   fatal it would certainly do it

      sometimes i thought i detected the
   peculiar odor in the ward i dont know
   whether it was my imagination or not
   but it seemed to always precede a death
   and filled me with the same horror  had
    experienced in the museum once or
   twice-things were seen by patients but 
   gave little credence to them

      dalphine and i at that time were
   living in rooms at the end of a long one-
   story ward of the hospital all the pa-
   tients had been removed from this wing
   temporarily as the ward was being
   cleaned and plastered it was a cold
   cheerless place to live in there was no
   heat save from a broken-down stove
   which stood in the hall and served for
   both rooms but only partially counter-
   acted the cold blasts which came through
   the ill-fitting window-sashes

      that we were not the only occupants
   of this wing soon became evident there
   was something that was always looking
   over my shoulder when i read or was
   waiting in the shadow of my room at
   dusk and when  walked down the long
   empty ward which adjoined our rooms
   to make ifv evening rounds it would fol-
   low me ivith light pattering footsteps
   it was continually fumbling my keys
   and after i had retired i could hear the
   bunch tinkle cautiously on the bureau

      in my sleep  imagined that the
   thing wished something it could not get
   and was reproaching me with soft blun-
   dering murmurs which would at last
   awake me and then go sighing down
   the corridor with the wind nee i
   heard or imagined  heard it crying out
   in the hall weeping like a woman and
    awoke with great pity in my heart

      i was not the only one who thought
   something strange was going on

    my dog which was a large terrier
and had always slept in my room at
night refused to remain there preferring
the cold outside to the strange visitor
sometimes i could coax him in but lie
was uneasy and with hair uplifted on
his back and muscles tense would watch
the thing in the dark hall growling with
his teeth barfed under his lips

   that dalphine noticed something
was wrong  have no doubt he never
spoke to me in this regard but  noticed
that he was greatly changed and went
about as if some terrible weight was op-
pressing him there were times indeed
when i thought his unceasingly agitated
mind was laboring with some oppressive
secret to divulge which he struggled for
the necessary courage he looked ghast-
ly and his heavy-skinned face was the
color of cigar-ash and creased with deep
lines

   he began to drink harder and time
and time again i could hear him in the
dead of night talking quickly as if lie
was quarreling with some one

   one morning early he awoke me and
accused me of going through his pockets
in search of the keys he had borrowed
the night before

    preston l want you to keep out
of my room at night he said

   i told him i had not been in his
room

    well some one has he continued
 they are after those keys

   he slapped the bunch on the table

    and look here lie added drawing
a revolver  some one has been annoy-
ing me-some devilish joke or other-
and the next time it happens  am going
to put a bullet through him whoever
he is

   as i marked his trembling hand and
startled face it was easy to sec that his
air of bravado was feigned and that be-
neath it the man was mortally shaken-
frightened almost beyond endurance

   in the evening of that day he came
to my room he bad got himself to-
gether somewhat looked better and was
perfectly sober

    i am sorry i acted the ass this
morning he said  i was in a bad
funk-rum i guess and nerves and no
sleep i want to take those museum keys
again
   


the all-story magazine

   as  handed them to him i noticed
he had a small file in his hand  he saw
the direction of my glance and explained
that he was going to file off the gold
ring on the severed hand in the museum

  it is too valuable to be allowed to
remain where it is he said  and i am
going to have it in payment you know
for the operation

   he bade me good night and left
me after he had gone i went to the
gate-house and got my dog singularly
enough he seemed willing to come to
my room and instead of sniffing all
around and nervously growling he con-
tentedly curled himself up near my chair

   at twelve oclock-i marked the
time exactly for i remember setting my
watch by the city clock whose bell car-
ried to me from the next square-i left
my room with the dog intending to take
a walk about the grounds before turn-
ing in

   it was a black winters night cold
and raw with no wind but a dampness
which felt like snow at any moment
the slight snow of the day before had
drifted into small heaps on the grass and
in corners and was frozen into a thin
crust on the pavement which made walk-
ing hazardous there were no noises
of carts and pedestrians in the streets
the restless grumble of traffic seemed
to have gone down with the wind
sounds carried far and clear and the
closing of a shutter in the hospital rang
out sharply in the night

   my walk led me toward the museum
with my dog pattering at my heels i
dont know what prompted me but as
 came closer i paused in my walk be-
fore turning back and watched dalphine
whom i could see plainly through the
lighted window he was bent over and

i	judged from the movement of his
arm that he was filing the ring

   suddenly he ceased working and
lilted his head as if he had heard some-
thing he stood for a few seconds mo-
tionless apparently listening and then
quickly turned and lifting his hands
in front of his face as if to ward off
something staggered back against the ta-
ble and sent it with the lamp crashing
to the ground that one instant when
t -aw the hormr of his face will haunt
me io rav dving dav

     stood rigid a if paralyzed looking
with staring eyes at the black window
the next moment a thin cry came from
the museum it went down my spine
like ice and touched the marrow of my
bones a cry at first broken and muffled
like the sobbing of a child which quickly
swelled into one long loud inhuman
screech and then abruptly ceased

   i started on a run for the museum
and threw myself against the door it
was unlocked and i burst suddenly
in a dense disgusting musklike odor
greeted my nostrils

     dalphine i shouted there was no
response from the blackness save the
growling of my dog which had fol-
lowed me

   i groped my way to the case and
then around it with hands stretched out
to protect me from i knew not what
and stumbled and fell over something

   kneeling i felt about and placed
my fingers on a human face still warm
but quiet and lifeless i shuddered and
drew back with repulsion for  knew
instinctively that the thing was dead
my hand went for the heart and i
found its pulsation gone and then i
felt for the neck to unloosen the collar
when i touched an ice-cold hand which
grasped thedead mans throat

    oh god  i cried and  oil
god  again and staggered upright
when something came toward me that

i	could not see but could feel with a
deep-seated terror of the mind some-
thing that gathered itself out of the
blackness and although i knew i was
in danger i could not move a muscle or
utter a sound and then js i stood there
this thing enveloped m and a hand
seized me by the throat bore me to
the ground

   i struggled and grasped its wet and
slimy wrist and struck out with my feet
for its body but the thing which had
me by the throat had no connection witfh
a human frame for my feet went through
thin air

  	at that instant my dog sprang for
my throat i felt his jaws close on
something fastened to my neck and his
hot breath in my face but the cold clam-
like fingers only pressed the tighter
tvhile my head swam with retained blood
and i fell my senses gradually leave inc
ihk celestial perfume



then indistinctly i heard a voice and
dimly perceived a light the grasp re-
laxed and t became unconscious for a
moment

   when i recovered myself i was
lying on the floor in one corner the
room was lighted by a lantern which
had been placed near me by the watch-
man who was bending over me and who
helped me to my feet

   wait a moment  said leaning
against the wall as lie started to ques-
tion me  let me pull myself together

   the watchman glanced about the
room and started back with a half-cry
when he saw the body for the first time

   it lay on its back with one hand
clenched and rigid at its throat in its
staring eyes and black and swollen face
was written fear such terror as no one
can describe which drove the color from
the watchmans cheek as he peered into
the dead mans face

    my god its doctor dalphine
he said hoarsely and then noticing the
black marks on the throat cried out that
he had been choked to death i nodded
my head and rubbed my neck which was
stiff and sore

   the grumbling and growling of the
dog which was worrying something in
the corner attracted his attention he
took the lamp and went toward the dog
and seizing him by the neck drove him
off the dog came to me whining

    look at what hes been at the
watchman said

   i came over to him still dazed and
saw him lift the severed arm i righted
the table and we placed the arm on it
the hand was torn and shredded by the
dogs teeth

     its the arm he was dissecting i
mumbled and shivered as with a chill

  morse did you hear him cry i
asked

     hear him  he said   i never heard
the like aye i heard him i can hear
him now oil lord what a cry 

   he wiped his handkerchief over his
face which was wet with sweat although
the room was cold as a vault

    i was just coming out of the main
building he continued  when i heard
it and turned and saw you running

    thank god for that i said com-
ing more to myself

  for what he questioned

     that you saw me dont you see
man it lifts murder from my soul you
find me here i continued  with a man
choked to death no one else about
 hats to prevent you and every one
thinking that i killed him but you
saw me running after he cried out-dont
forget that morse-and you followed
me in and found me unconscious and
dr dalphine dead youll have to tell
that to the coroner 

     why the watchman said  doctor
you dont suppose any one would think
you killed him look there he point-
ed to a window at the end of the room
which was wide open

  the doctor paused in his story his
voice was hoarse and he drank eagerly
from a glass of water on the table

   and now comes the explanation he
continued

  in those days in the basement of
the pencoyd flospital were a number of
rooms where the insane were confined
that night just before dalphine was
killed morse the watchman found that
an insane patient james long had
broken open the door of his room and
escaped he was a dangerous lunatic
with homicidal mania

   morse was looking for him when he
heard dalphines cry he thought the
madman had raised the window in the
rear of the museum entered quietly and
strangled dalphine and attacked me
the solution seemed more than plausible
for on coming from the building after
arranging dalphines body we found the
lunatic crouching in the corner of the
steps we overpowered him with diffi-
culty and again placed him in his room

   of course there was great excite-
ment the next day as the story of the
murder leaked out the coroners jury
after an exhaustive inquiry came to the
conclusion that dalphine had been killed
by james long the lunatic the state-
ment of the watchman completely exon-
erated me but i think that if he had not
seen me running toward the museum
after dalphine cried out it might have
been a nasty business

   strange as it may seem the arm dis-
appeared during the night the coroner
and police did not give any weight to
this fact i searched the museum and
the all-story magazine

the grounds- about thoroughly but could
no find it nor was it ever again seen in
the hospiial

  	a i said in the beginning this ex-
ination seemed satisfactory to all who
heard it and  have n doubt will seem
so to you hut to me there was something
else-something that only  who had
gone through such an experience can ap-
preciate

   there is only one other thing con-
nected with this singular occurrence and
then i am done

   three years ago it was decided to
remove all tubercular cases from the
city hospital for this purpose a large
plot o ground was purchased in order
ti- build a new hospital for them i was
one of the committee for the erection of
this building the spot chosen was a
large pauper burying-ground on the out-
k-ns of the city which had been in dis-
use for some time

   one day while i was overlooking
the work i was standing near some v ork-
men whr-- texcavation was taking
place watching them remove a coffin
the top of which suddenly gave way and
exposed the skeleton within i climbed
d-wc freon where  was standing to get
a clear view of the remains which i
feund to be these of a chinaman from
the naked skull was still attached a long
jet-black queue

   all the bodies that had been disin-
terred were placed in a shed awaiting
transportation to another burying-

ground after this coffin had been
placed wh the rest  went over alone

and lifting the cover iooked carefully
within the body had evidently been
despoiled by those who buried it for the
bones lay naked in the wooden box

   one of the arms was broken off
clean near the shoulder as if the bone
had been sawed through i lifted the
hand that was flexed on the forearm and
straightened out the fingers which were
clenched in the palm a large gold ring
dropped from the bony finger to the bot-
tom of the coffin

   i picked it up n was half filed
through

   gentlemen  gave you an explana-
tion of the first part of my story

   to this last i give you none

   but the ring one of the men said
-what became of itr

  the doctor withdrew one end of his
watch-chain from his pocket and ms-
clasped the heavy gold ring

   there it is he said placing it on
the table

  the window in the room was open
and a soft summer breeze was blowing
die curtains

  the man near the window sniffed

   do you notice a peculiar smell com-
ing through that window he asked

  the doctor smiled and said

   my story has made a great impres-
sion does it smell like musk 

  but presently he arose and closed the
window quickly

burdocks and blueberries

               by george allan england

  provtng that in the many-
  ringed circus of life one gets
  tumbles as well as applause

 i his here blind side-track we run
into last year said napoleon

i burdock proprietor of bur-
dock brothers big tent
sbo as  ail begins aion of  hard

frost we encountered just outside the
great new england pie belt

  napoleon squintingly lighted the prof-
fered  her ot at a hissing gasoline-fiare
then sprangh-d down agin at ease on
one of h own reserved seats

   lemme ruminate a bit now and dras
a few details off the mental junk-heap
and iii give it to you straight how us
and our dutch side-partner hermann
all got tarul-footed on the same stretch
of adamantine lurk
burdocks and blukberriks



   our show was this kind of a show-
a refined black-face vawdeveal with
mimical jolly isms and a wire act on the
side we had a little menagerie too
there was a gray wolf some coon-cats
dyed with anil in dyes and billed as cir-
cassian tigrettes and a canady link
which the link was that moth-eaten you
couldnt have taken your oath whether it
was a naturally bald beast with oasises
of fur or vicky-verky we had a wall-
eyed bear too named miltiades-dys-
peptic he was and pessimistic on account
of a bad cough besides all these there
was a dummy stuffed to reppesent a pole
nihilist shawl-grots or saw-grass or
some such name

   for humans there was me and eb
my brother plus a couple of kids
named mccarty but billed as the angelo
freres plus  kid  nagle the six-hand-
ed bag-puncher and a slim paderewsky
named jefferson figg what tortured the
fiddle and played the bass-drum-cymbal
combination with his knees plus bill
macklin who manipulated the horse-
teeth of our vest-pocket melodeon

   bill was a curly-headed good lookin
britisher from leeds which we called
him the leeds duck because the organ-
bellerses was that small he had to pump
one hundred and twenty to the minute
like a sure-enough ducks paddle-wheels
navigatin a mill-pond

   add to the above  peg  wilkins
which is our adipose advance agent with
a real genius for alcohol and with a
mahogany leg the same bein as fine a
piece of wood-turnin as ever i see and
you have the toot ensimble of burdocks
amalgamated australian and diamond
musee

   we toured the granite state and for
a while did a land-office biz playin on
velvet to a houses unfortunately it
didnt last nope when we crossed
over into n h and tried to string up
there somethin solid fell on us in the
shape of an injunction bought and paid
for by a sure-enough circus in the next
county

   youve got to have a thousand-dollar
license to exhibit a circus in little old
n h a slight detail we wasnt wise to
so as per above this here injunction
drops on us like a pint of half-melted
ice-cream down a fat mans osteopathy

   lawyers and sheriffs swarmed round
the amalgamated for a spell like a
queen-bees weddin but though her-
mann and us was handy with the jaw-
tackle wedidnt really have a look-in at
the game at all bein tied to the post
as compared with the red-tape men when
it come to a legal show-down

  it aint a circus at all that were
exhibitin  is our contention  with-
out equine equilibration how d you
make a circus out of us 

  youve got a reener aint you
says the law-buzzards

    um-m-m yes but whats that got
to do with it

    makes it a circus thats all a
teener does a reeners a reener and
youre a circus and wfe can prove it re-
peats the law-buzzards  put up a thou-
sand or quit the state

   so we quit

   well first thing we done after trav-
el in away from them unsalubrious re-
gions was take account of stock what
with salaries transportation and el cet
wes up against three hundred of debt
and our cash assets is thirty-nine-sixty
the stock-takin developed into a coun-
cil of wrar blue bein the prevailin color
which it would have been far far more
of a frosty-phiz party if wed been wise
to the kind of jiu-jitsu package fate had
ribbed up to hand us before long

   the decision we reached was this
kind of a decision

   hermann was to hustle back lo his
home burg to try and raise the mazoom
and then execute a gyration over the map
lookin for a good all-summer proposition
at some amusement park or other - salt
harbor says he  is a likely place

   me and eb meantime is to keep on
with the show workin south on credit
biz dont bid fair to be s good a up
among the turkey-necked plow-pushers
because of course the people is more
huirn thefarther away you get and the
better run theyll want for their money
but still we reckons some way we can
pull along till hermann finds a chance
for us to recoop

   well hermann he takes nine dol-
lars and moseys out leavin us with only
thirty dollars and sixty cents in coin to
grease the wheels of destiny it takes
moren that when heres el even people
and six animals and a mummy and
freight and car-fare and advertlsin so
the wheels squeaked this whole story
is just the echo of that there t squeak
which it made the band-wagon of our
lives considerable noisy for quite a while

   peg wilkins our advance agent
couldnt walk on the railroad track no
way in this world what with slumpin
into the cinders and jarrin on the ties
with that mahogany leg of his so we
had to ship him along southward to the
next town with the noahs ark bunch
freight and ticket evaps twelve plunks
and leaves us only fourteen after de-
ductin two-sixty for meat to feed the
critters its about  pm on the
th of june and a thursday when
the tail-lights of pegs train fades from
our view leavin us to economize by
plain every-day foot-work

   we pounds cinders and spruce pretty
much all night and next mornin dopes
into a wart on the map called gilead we
blows a couple of dollars against some
human fodder which brings us down to
twelve simoleons and puts us very low
in our minds which were lower short-
ly after trvin to arrange for a show
there bein a town regulation due to
some local womens anti-everything
league which prohibits tent exhibitions
therefore its hire a hall or hike so
me and eb leaves our troupe reposin
round the freight-house and snipes our-
selves over the burg in a hurry

   well mister man that must have
been an off-day for luck in gilead the
balm-market was sure dry not a place
could we locate that wasnt occupied
the grange had a meetin on their date-
book  there was a fair runnin and the
opera house was full of hay

   we fine-tooth-combed the settlement
fore an aft and at last by bull-luck
run to earth a individual whos said to
know somethin about some place thats
said to possibly be for hire this indi-
viduals name is walker callington
phipps and he has a head on him like a
long mackrimay-lacework of glowing
whiskers glued to an ostrich-egg the
egg being lumpy you understand be-
sides hes lean with a burking adams
apple

  hall says he when we grapples
him  hall fr a circus nawp

    why not  falters eb with a qua-
king diaphragm
  its our lodge hall aint ben let
fr a show sence two years ago last
jan-u-wary

    wjiich the reason is  says 
niggers they had it fr min-
strels and the like o that took us three
days to clean up now we aint friend-
ly to no such doins

    see here mister says  catchin
him by the front part of his clothes

 were on the narrow edge of the soup-
kettle ami it all rests with you people
which way we tumble-see our whole
bunch animals and humans has only
twelve dollars between us and the sher-
iff if wes stranded here gileads got
to care for us and youre a taxpayer-
see 

   walker gallington polished off his
ivory-colored coco with his handkerchief
swallowed hard and then said said he
  if you wont take your critters in
the hall and promise to be careful of
the furnishins and also give us eight
dollars plus half the gate-money i reck-
on you kin show here

   at that eb and me orates some
plenty but w g is harder than a coun-
try-hotel bed and our eloquence cant
dent him he takes refuge in behind
his hirsute drop-curtain and refuses to
budge

    whats more says he  i cant al-
low no regular charge to be made this
bein our lodge hall but folks can
contribute whatever they sees fit other-
wise the deals all off

   fresh bunches of consternation on
our part-more rapid-fire expostulation
all wasted its a case of take it or
leave it and no more to be said so we
takes it but were sad sad and sos all
the rest when we breaks the news to em
but the try of our lives has to be made
sadness or no sadness so we prepares to
give gilead the broadest-gaged fusillade
of folly wes capable of furnishin

   we attracts quite some attention
teamin our stuff down to the hall and
the streets full by the time our cages
is displayed in the entryway you never
see such a bunch of jaspers as buzzed
out to observe- us-regulation yahoos

clatterty-rattle in that pail was sure the
gladdest sound that ever tickled my tym-
panums loves old sweet song nah

spasms but she cant travel in the same

   its only when the shows over and
the people all gone the lamps beginnin

that we wakes up which the cause is
w g phipps coinin up to the stage
and dumpin out the contents of the col-
lection it runs out kc-rjingle on the
boards with us all gathered round like
starvation coyotes inspectin a nest of
juicy young jack-rabbits

  which theres a dozen tin tops from
chow-chow bottles picked up on a
neighborin dump-they looks some like
silver dollars when held skilful theres
a brass check good for one cup of coffee
at a place called the empire spa and a
plugged canady penny five grcen-
cloth tobacco-sacks crumpled up sos
they look like dollar bills-oh yes

  w g looks blank too and his

that now it looks to me like youre
about- to the end of your rope and i
aint goin to be hard on you take the
cash says he  and whatever of this
here junk is any good to you and ill
annex the reffage w hat say we sort
it

    with that he goes to winowin the
pay-dirt from the tailins and shoves the
coin our way along of the meal-ticket
the tooth and the coffee-check

     take the loocer says w g  and
make good use of it ill square things
with the lodge folks but try to get
out of here early in the mornin by the
way if youll be careful and not do no
damage you can sleep here to-night but
no drinkin and no disturbance-see
if theres any alkyhoj brought in here
dead-weight or live youll hear from me

    and he vibrates a spavined fin at us
his words ended harsh but still con-
siderin what hed done for us better
man never cultivated spinach on his neck

    after hed gone eb and the duck
and me collars peg-leg whos been show-
in signs of dryness and expounds some
desperation plans to him

    peg says i takin- him by the
shoulder- peg things is all to the ex-
tremely worse and its now we put our
last sumarchee against a final shake of
the dice either we gets away from herp
and makes a strike in the next town
which is bethel or we goes broke right
here and takes the count heres all
the coin weve got except two plunks
take it theres a train out of here
south-bound at twelve-two take that
too

    you and your lithos make one
quick exit and bill us the limit in
bethel-see bill us we and the ani-
mals will follow some way one good
haul and well sand the rail again  a fail-
ure-but there thats too ghoulish for
contemplation hump now and as
you hope for salvation no rum

  my trunk whimpers peg  with
all m worldly goods-two wigs a shirt
and some burnt cork-if you go bust
will you send it back to old hoboken
  sure thing skip now

    we steers him out past the cages
and into the street and he weeps a few
as he receives our blessin then he

   fades into the night with his posters and
our cash headin for the deepo

    not very long after that in spite of
 there bein such a hollowness in the place
 where we used to remember we had
 stomachs and notwithstanding the un-
 certain outlook for the future we folds
 ourselves up here and there on the stage
 and prepares for slumber none of us
 has sand enough left to wash off the
 grease-paint and burnt cork we just
 lavs right down as we are black-face and
 ali

    eb he blows out the lights i tucks
 my blank-cartridge animal-trainin pistol
 under my canvas-scenery pillow and
 composes my mind to rest about the
 last thing i remembers hearin is a faint
 far-away  hoot-toot-toot  which i
 knows is the train for bethel and on
 that train is peg-leg bearin away all our
 prospecks worldly hopes and the most
 of our cash

      good old peg thinks i  pikin off
 ahead to help us to-morrow some-
 thin will turn up sure then  listens
 to the beur coughin it gets farther an
 farther away the cough does and a kind
  of warm rosy hope nestles down among
 the icebergs of our luck till at last i
 drifts away into the arms of murphys

     guess its about  am and
 wes all pounding our ear luxurious
 holding a sure-pop symphonic snore-fest
 when theres a  knock-tap-thumpetv-
 bump at the door mingled up with
 the barkin of colonel colonel was the
 angelo frercss little fox-terrier and
 complicated with sounds as of a human
 voice all of which jars me back to a
 lame chilly hungry kind of flabbergasted
 consciousness

     sits up sudden in the dark and
 reaches for my pistol its harmless as a
 nursing-bot but kind of good to bluff
 with a prod in the laths from me starts
 eb up all frowsly

       hats that  he whispers in a kind
 of a scared tell-me-quick-or-ill-holler
 voice that sets my scalp-lock to elevatin

     sheriff maybe  i answers  maybe
 tar-an-feathers hear that

      there comes a rattlin then the voice
 again and somethin paws at the door
 then the bear coughs and the rattle comes
 again
burdocks and blueberries



     tryin to unlock it  exclaims el
and jumps up half dazed he starts for
the door and you remember js in a
strange place darkern pharaosp pocket
durin the tenth plague wen result
is that eb does a sevcn-league-boot stride
off the edge of the platform which its
over a yard high on the way down he
takes a footlight with him and theres a
frappe of glass oil and eb on the car-
pet immediate

  hurt says i climbin down very
cautious

    murdered  he bellows  strike
a match im dyin

   as the light flares the others rouse
up and theres a cloudburst of questions
by the time i gets a lamp lit and has
eb on his feet again what with him
limpin round and the others a mixture
of negligee and commiseration we makes
a study for a poets dream

   the smashed lamp and oily carpet
nearly distracts our minds from the
original cause of the whole to-do yet
all this time theres a rattlin at the door
a tappin and that peculiar voice seem-
inly eloquent over and above most
voices

    come on now boys and see whats
doin   says i when eb gets pulled to-
gether a bit  ill open the door seein
as ive got the pistol but you all back
me up and dont let em rush us 

    by this time wes at the door me in
front with the artillery duck right be-
hind me with the lamp and the rest
back of him

     look out now says i as i snaps
back the catch and pokes the little blank
revolver through the crack

    who-w-w-whos there  says i
expectin a rush of some sort but nary
rush comes theres not even anybody
standin outside and what to make of
it im stumped if i know

    hold that light here  says i
and the duck obeys then the faint halo
of a jag wafts in round the edge of the
door i peeks out and theres some-
thin human lyin on the porch talkin
to itself the raw truth catches me

     peg-leg 

  what echoes my petrified min-
ions  peg-leg 

     him  says i and throws the door
wide open	

    lifeless almost but beautiful he lay
and no boiled owl was ever boilder than
him he was smilin smilin with his eyes
shut and prattliiv like an innocent child
which the prattle and the wooden leg
tappin the floor and the large equator
of him and the smile-you-couldnt-file-off
make a tablow vivong of rare beautv
more especial as hes swimmin-like with
his hands and flopping head from one
side to the other 

    frensh kind good frensh says
he  couldnt bandon kind lovin mnag-
erie-left m trunk-all m worldly
goods-aint honrable bandon compan-
ions in trouble-honrable trunk-kind

an lovin-

   he looked like somethin the cat
brought in and us in our play-actin
costooms with the grease-paint makin
us blush outside of our sickenin misery
under the smoky light of one lamp-the
picture it made was a jeezly frost now
you can bet on that and carry money
home

    come fellers in with him says i
at last and we drags him inside where
he passes away and begin to go prr-ouff
in full chromatics with oblongato varia-
tions then we hold another mask-
ball-effeck council of war what our
emotions was i wont try to tell you
cause the words aint made yet to fit em

   first thing we done after reason
assumed her swav over despair was
search the cuss hopin against hope lies
still got some change left after his
merry-go-round of the speak-easies

   sixty-eight cents is now all thats
left plus a yeller pawn-ticket plus some
pretzel-crumbs

    this says the leeds duck judi-
cial when the census is complete  looks
like the most complicated game  ever
stacked into wed better explode this
show right here and now-open the ani-
mal-cages-each of us run a different
way critters and all they can t catch
more than a part of us anyhow

    it certainly does look like starva-
tion sheriffs and a shirt-tail scoot over
the map for ours says i  one jump
ahead of annihilation them that wants
to quit can quit now who goes  

   everybody looks at everybody else
but no one starts	 

  well now says t if wes goin
to hang together my say is that the
quicker we mosey out of here the better
itll be i aint hankerin none to meet
v g in i lie mornin when he sees the
damage and hears of the doins in this
lodge hall this here situation is a
camel and pegs the final bunch of
straw exit left for ours how much
money in the gang

   everybody digs up with both flip-
pers and we manages to corral three-
twelve plus the meal ticket the gold-
filled tooth and the lead quarter

  hand it all over i i commands
and takes possession of the wealth in
the name of the common good

  now then says  the only lay
 see is to hike out rapid somewheres
into the country take up some land thats
idle and use it till we hears from her-
mann the farmers life they say is
the only reely independent one on earth
me for it says kid nagle en-
thusiastic hed been brought up in a
gutter and believed potatoes grew on
trees

     but the animals objected jeffer-
son p figg  what we goin to do with
a bear or aniliu cats or a link out
farmin can you hypnotize em into
subsistin on spruce-boughs  

    i read once of a man crossin the
sahara answers   which he has a
little dog with him and they runs out
of grub well this here man cuts the
dogs tail off and makes soup of it-
see-and gives the bone to the dog
and theys both happy and pulls through
what man has done man can do so dont
you worry none

    but miltiades is a cinnamon bear
and cinnamon bears aint got no tails
aw reverse for yours says i
 youre a skeptic and lifes too short
to waste arguin with them what has no
imagination

iv

   resultin from the conference of
war i sends the angelo mccarty freres
out in the gray of early mornin one
to the railroad deepo to see if theres
any telegram yet from hermann while
the other one rustles up a livery-stable
and orders a big barge with two horses
the rest of us washes up and packs our
stuff preparatory to migratin

   about the time i-rancesco de mike
angelo returns with no news from the
deepo his brother vincento pat drives
up with the barge sittin on the front
seat along of the driver which is a big
red-mottled-faced gazebe inclined to lie
graspin as to coin

   i dickers with this individual and
arranges for three dollars worth of
transportation in consideration of the
dough lies to take us way out into the
country and dump us in some likely place
and say nothin i s humans and the
dog and the bear is to go the rest of
the animals we leaves on the front steps
of the hall with a sign on one of the
cages like this

left for benefit of kind creditors

wc cant keep em so we leave em
feed em right and theyll love you-

   this arranged we stows our baggage
on top of the barge puts old miltiades
in his cage crossways ol the vehicle in
front lays peg-leg in the straw and piles
in the driver cracks his whip one or
two fossilized citizens yawps at us the
horses stagger the old barge creaks wob-
bles and makes a heave forward and
were off

   few seen and none mourned our
departure from that hospitable burg
two or three times eb and me tries
to get the driver started on some nice-
weather-were-havin talk but he lias a
bad case of the fishy eye and answers
with nothin but an ice-w-agon line of
grunts so we lets our gab-policies lapse

  after that we drives in silence
broken only by old miltiadess grumb-
lin and pegs gradual wakin up verv
low in our minds and all to the bad
as to interior furnishin we aint had
a four-cornered feed in twenty-four
hours and you ranr live on bananas and
crackers and wear turned collars and feel
human thats a fact we gets out of
town pretty soon into the real yap dis-
tricts where every farmhouse shells out
gawpin reubes in the damp cold dawn

   well we jolts and sags along the
rutty road for half an hour or more
till at last we comes to a kind of
wooded point juttin out into a lake-
burdocks and blueberries



spot pond the driver says it is we
takes a vote and its spot pond for
ours so we stops and unloads ourselves
trunks tents and miltiades

   gettin the baggage down from on
top of the barge kid nagle unfortu-
nately puts a little of his weight on the
side-bars and one of em buckles up so
the top slumps over and spills peg-legs
trunk which sort of explodes the shirt
and wigs and burnt cork into the ditch
that sobers peg in a minute what be-
tween the shock of his loss and the vilent
efforts to rescue his property he plumb
gets over his alcoholics

   as for the driver when he sees his
barge cave in he grows vicious but we
quells him and sends him os home
wavin his ham of a list and the lan-
guage that floats back to us is some cay-
enne or i aint no judge of embroidered
speechifvin

   its maybe five hundred yards from
the road to the far side of the wooded
point and by the time we totes our
stuff and the bear-cage in there leadin
miltiades by his nose-ring the polish
is pretty well off our shaftin were
glad to strike such a haven of peace you
bet the woods is on two sides of us
to the left is a marshy place and dead
ahead is the lake where we decides
to camp theres a clean beach take
it all round its a boss and dandy loca-
tion

   first thing we does after we gets
the tents set up and washes in the lake
is to have a try for some fish a few
pins and alder poles and some twine
does for tackle and theres plenty worms
round the swamp not a quarter-hour
from the time were settled you cd a
seen us stragglin round the lake shore
peg and all though peg he sinks in the
beach pretty bad his mahogany leg bein
smallish and round at the end

   i finds him a good place on a log
that sticks out of the water-a good
likely lookin place with a muddy bot-
tom where pouts is apt to come

   go in and win i tells him and
then walks along castin here and there
but not even gettin so much as a sucker
on my hook-and me a circus man too

   well i aint gone but a hundred
feet or mebbe two when theres a gi-
gantic ktrjlop and a sort of yell cut in

two in the middle and then a bubbly
noise

  what-th-deuce thinks i and
starts back on the run

   say d you know when i gets in
sight of the log there aint no peg on
it but theres a kind of egg-beater ef-
feck in the water with rile and mud
and bubbles all sousled up together
pegs fish-pole too is floatin and his
hat and theres somethin ele-kind
of a stick with a knob on it thats frothin
the water convulsive like a churn-stick

 what-the- i begins again

but all of a sudden a human boot pro-
jects out of the water near the stick
and theres a leg in the boot-pegs good
leg the leg and the stick pirouettes
foamily a minute and then starts to go
down but i skips out along the log
grabs the stick and hauls in

   peg he comes up blowin like the
father of all bellowses drippin ooze and
mud

    i s-s-slipped on some tarn-n-nation
moss  he splutters  and my --leg
floated and my head s-s-stayed down
and id a been drowned in bout a
m-m-minute if you hadnt got me
pf-f-fui iviwosh you told me to
g-g-go in and win and i did look 

   and he holds up the two-pound
mud-pout that had pulled him offn the
slippery log its sure a strangle hold
hes got on the pout as i helps him back
along the log

   by the time pegs cleaned up and
dressed in some gladiator togs of mine
they bein the only spare things weve
got with a big enough equator-stretchy
cloth the others straggle in with more
or less fish and we lights a fire chow-
ders suggested and what with a few
hunks of dog-biscuit stolen plumb out-
right from colonel and our catch we
makes up a good hot kettle of grub

   which after the tin plates is licked
clean by colonel and miltiades and we
gets our pipes goin round the fire we
votes it aint so tarnation bad even it we
are cross-hobbled by fate and turned
loose on a beach to scrabble up a livin
by unusual and irregular means like a
bunch of cats tryin to catch mice in a
sleepin-car

   smokin we argues what to do with
miltiades we cant feed him and we
cant let him starve eb suggests tryin

	my sahara methods on him one paw at a
time kid nagle says to kill and eat
him while j  figg wants to make
him hibernate the rest says to let him
go and as wes in the majority go he
has lo but he aint at all eager for free-
dom  quite the contrary

    its only when we threatens to poke
him with a hot iron trapeze-bar that hell
get up at all and climb down outa his
cage he wont leave the camp even
then but hangs round sniffin at the
dishes till we plumb has to drive him
off finally seein as how we aint goin
to he his meal-ticket no longer he boos
and snuffles and crashes off through the
woods more sad than mad yet makin
little side-swipes at the bushes too for
to show he aint an angel hut just a
plain every-day human kind of a bear
after all

    by-bv says the duck when the
last of him and hes very hob-ended
at that disappears in the undergrowth
and then we clots round the fire again
to talk things over and hatch plans-
plans bein like eggs which they hatch-
es out best in a warm place

    the plans end in a blueberry cru-
sade blueberries yes-acres of em all
along the edges of the woods-big juicy
fellers just the custard for the agglom-
erated tent shows we all goes at em
that afternoon takes tin dishes and goes
to peckin at the bushes like a bunch of
hens punishin hot mash

    it aint too bad neither what with
the blue sky an the white-cappy lake
the bumblybees workin overtime for the
lloney trust and maybe a big steely
blue devils darning-needle skyhootin
past with a santos dumont flicker of
wings two or three of us shucks foot-
leather and does the k-nipe-cure act

    and youd a envied us our appetites
that evenin when we comes in with thir-
ty quarts of blueberries and gathers
round the fire to eat a supper of more
chowder and them same berries with
two quarts of milk that we borrowed
from a farmers cow over in a pasture
beyond the swamp

    and after supper we smokes again
and rags away at this that and the
other thing mostly speoulatin as to
how hermanns makin it and when hell

get on track of us again pretty soon
the little new moon comes up over the
woods like a muskmelon rind over a
back fence and then we gets out a couple
of banjos and does stunts of war in
while eb and the duck accompanies on
the african harp

   ive seen worse times in the show biz
you can bet your hand to the plasterin
on rtf

v

  aboui am that night there busts
in on us a rumpus thats a blend
of growls squeals barks and just plain
noise like a menagerie turned loose in a
slaughter-house we comes to in a
hurry all buzzin questions and i grips
my revolver like a miser boldin on to
a goldfish seems like the noise is sort
of bearish we sees somethin lumberin
toward the cage with colonel orbitin
round uncommon eloquent

  shoat hollers kid nagle of a
sudden and  save it  echoes the duck

   in about one second theres a mix-up
the agglomerated tent shows versus
miltiades with one young pig as first
prize

   twas epic while it lasted but we
gets the pig eventual though kind of tat-
tered a shame to do it-to rob the old
boy when hes been retrievin-but fact
is we needed the meat and aint that kind
of excuse good for any sort of graft by
firelight we dresses the critter  milt he
comes in like a sure-enough proletariat
for whats left over

   and about half-past ten next morn-
ing after havin breakfasted in epicure-
an style on berries and shoat you could a
seen eb and j p and me hikin to town
with tin pails full of the fruit our idea
was to sell em and lay in supplies swap
em for things and also redeem the meal-
ticket wed got in the contribution for
whatever it would fetch we must have
had twenty or twenty-five quarts and
wes calculatin what a bunch of edibles
theyll swap for to say nothin of cash

   but our frenzied finance strikes a
rock and busts wide open like a jellyfish
hit by a baseball bat just subsequent to
our first try at the market

     blueberries maam says  at the
first house we strikes when the lady
comes to the door-she bein the feather-
burdocks and blueberries



bolster kind with a string tied round
also she has one of them wans the kind
you always want to grab and yank off

   she only stares so again says i
 blueberries  

    land sakes no she answers
 youre handlin the wrong article
then she laughs and her double chin
suddenly adopts another roll of fat off
her neck so shes got three chins

    i snum says she  blueberries is
the hardest thing to sell that there is
round here why they even grows in
peoples back yards this is preservin-
time and i reckon everybodys supplied
youd better try another line such as
apple-trees or needles or rat-pizen

   then she shut the door

   take my oath we never sold more
than two quarts that whole mornin but
we collected quite a lot of grub by bar-
ter especially from the empire spa
where j p figg exchanged the meal-
ticket for a big sackful of dry bread
all kinds

   when we got back to camp and
joined dividends we found a blueberry
pie some johnny-cake with blueberries
in it and a jar of fresh blueberry pre-
serve seems like we wasnj cut out to
forget the taste of blueberries anyway
so wehas dinner-pig garnished with
berries-and renders thanks that wes
still alive

   that afternoon it sets in to rain a
little so we huddles into the tents and
chews the rag miltiades lingers round
we can hear him off and on cracklin the
bushes long toward evenin the rain
lets up and we goes out prospectin dnce
more this time eb and me runs onto
a potato-field tother side of the woods
without any visible owner except the
bugs which is disportin of themselves
scandal ious

    potatoes  says i  and why not 
says ed and then we goes at em

   if it comes right down to starva-
tion or coppin grub most of us will
cop any day we takes care to pull the
tubers out the side of the hills sos not
to disturb the plants any and we puts
the dirt back careful in ten minutes
wes hikin back to camp every pocket
crammed and better potatoes i never
squdged tooth into-big white fellers
hot and mealy

   but the reckonin next day wasnt
so pleasant eb you see had left one
hill open by mistake and die fanner
happened along with some bug-powder
and seen it and it was all off with us
immediate

   this here farmer was a swede or
finn or somethin about six feet six in
his socks only he didnt wear socks and
weathered-lookin same as tanbark he
blows into camp while were all awav
bertyin all except the hibernian an-
gelo freres whos peelin potatoes for
dinner when he sees em he lands a
kick on colonel that near petrifies him
and doubles up his hands and orates

   har bane my potato says he
 my potato and yu bane tiefs and ay
pu yu in lockup and yu haf big dog
steal my yung pig 

   see the boss answers mike an-
gelo   cant sprecken zee dutch

    dutch y u call me dutch and
yu tief my pig and potato ay get
de law on yu  

   then he cuffs mike and cusses yin-
cento pat de angelo and makes a quick
exit when hes gone the kj hollers
for us and we comes lopin in to see
whats up pretty soon it sounds like a
crow-congress discussin the tariff on
com in a tamarack as a result of our
deliberations we buries the hog-bones
and potato-peelins in a good safe place
where they wont never be found and
eb and me pikes for town hotfoot on
the trail of svensky finn to lock horns
with the police force of gilead

   we finds the force hoein his gar-
den just havin given the finn party a
warrant for our arrest its somethin
of a supprise to him when he sees us
and its more of a supprise when i comes
out plump with a demand for a warrant
on my own hook against said scandi-
navian it seems that w g phipps is
buzzin on our trail too for damages to
his lodge hall so our stock is some
depreciated with the police

    why says he  my duty is t ar-
rest both of you this very minute and
lock ye up to say nothin of givin you
a warrant

  hold no not so fast says eb
 heres us campin out in the country
tryin to keep body an- soul from get-
tin an absolute divorce till our side-
im k a  story magazine



partner turns up with money or a con-
track or somethin now then be fore you
take action you got to perduce some evi-
dence aint you we acknowledge the
corn a- regards the hall but we left our
menagerie to cover that

   as for the pork an potato racket
you come long with us an if you find
any evidence well all go to jail for as
long s you say if you dont then
weve got an action against that there
iiim for malicious defrangification of
character also kickin our prize dog

which its a valuable one-

    and the case will be took higher
i interrupts  us bein backed by infloo-
ential people at home to say nothin of
the expense your burg will be put to in
maintainin us if were arrested

    plus the action that will be brought
by the real owner of the show for de-
tainin of us

    hold on wait says the police
force  gilead aint wantin to git tan-
gled in no spider-web of litigation
wait here and ill fix you up a paper
sos mebbe you can settle out of court
and sive the town expense

   and off he spraddles into the house
bout five minutes later he comes out
again with a folded document

    here says he  you see your man
now and square things with him
thisll help and you clear out of the
town limits inside of twenty-four hours-
see way out if you dont youll hear
from me pussonal

  thanks says i we will but
which it was we meant we left him to
guess

   then we hipered back to camp only
stoppin to exchange a nickel which we
found lay in loose in the linin of my
coat for a big bunch of stale bread that
bein cheaper than fresh and filling-er

vi

   w hex we arrives at the lake we finds
theres trouble in the shape of a country
constable with svensky finns warrant
and finn hes there too the group -
picture they made and the cyclone ar-
guments that was takin- place when we
heaved iu sight was sure full of action
seems like finn - case aint makm much
headway cause there aint no evidence
not a skrid of it anywheres except his

say-so which aint no  tetter than ours
bui soons we arrives we puts that to
rights immediate

   sure says i we took the goods
 our bear caught the shoat which bein
 hungry we ate it serve your warrant
 says i to the yap sheriff  and while
 youre servin it serve this too such bein
 your duty 

    with which i presents our paper
 against finn for assault an battery an
 umstification of character and ft crt
 when the officer and finn sees that they
 both has frosty phiz almighty sudden and
 severe

   what bane de trouble meester
 asks finn of the constable runnin his
 claws through his mop of tow

     why-er-step over this way ef
 you please answers the reube and they
 retires toward the woods for a confer-
 ence off to the left  hears a cracklin
 and knows miltiades aint far distant
 and while wes standin there very nerv-
 ous to know whether finns goin to settle
 out of court or push matters a figure
 comes lopin cross-lots for us the sun
 glints off a bunch of flamin hirsuteness
 and we all recognizes more trouble in
 the mediate future

    w g phipps of course and when
 hes near enough he hauls out a paper
 too and pokes it at me

    i takes it to spar for wind and
 say its a bill for damages to the hall-
 ten dollars altogether what with the
 busted footlight burnt carpet and gen-
 eral disorder to say nothin of pegs fos-
 silsation while im lookin it over
 with loud mental groans back comes the
 sheriff and finnsky

     heres how weve fixed it gents
 says the sheriff  complainant says hes
 willin to annul proceedin if you do
 likewise

      an hh pleasure says i  he apolo-
 gizin ample

    well says the sheriff old
 viking

    yike gets red and hunts for a place
 where he can put his hands without
 steppin on em then he falls over his
 palate and stammers

      ay hope yu excuse me tell in vu
 how yu bane tiefs and ay say now dat
 even dough yu bane tiefs vu aint bane
 tiefs 
burdocks and blueberries

    we accepts that apology says i
and shakes hands with finn

    glad one case is settled remarks
the sheriff while svenskv backs away
still holdin on to his hands sos life
wont trip over em  theres another
though-this here bill of mr phippss
-ten dollars will you settle and move
on or shall we sue

  youre welcome to all ive got-
exclaims the duck  though  tell you
right here if you take it i have to walk
away in a barrel

    same here says i then a sudden
hope busts in my think-tank

    do i understand i asks  that if
this here bill is settled itll square us
with gilead and we gets the menagerie
back and are free to leave town is
such the meanin of the court

     it is says the sheriff

    whats a big cinnamon bear worth
to you   i asks  bears bein on a risin
market and shop-worn ones bringin one
hundred an fifty or over

   theres a gleam of yellow in the
sheriffs eye as he answers

   thirty dollars said bear warranted
sound and kind

    make it fifty and our darlin mil-
tiades is lost to us forever

     forty

    done says i  gimme the thirty
dollars change and lies yours

  hold on says he hold on
wheres the bear

    oh off there in the woods hear
him cough take him lies yours

   i waved my hand eloquent

    but-but you got to deliver the
goods aint you 

    thats right come along boys
says i to my henchmen  come an
well round up milt

   was it some dust blew into my eye
or just a plain every-day wink

    spread out says i  and circle
round tack of him and you three i
continues to the gileadites  stay here
by the edge of the woods and head him
off when he runs out he aint been fed
in some time and his tempers all to the
bad till he gets some inward baggage
but the minute you lay hands on him
lies yours-see

    but-but- protests the sheriff

    thats all right  reassures him

 we aint tryin to take no due honor
away from you and remember a bears
nose is the tenderest place hes got one
good crack on the probosci puts the most
husky bruin in the d and o for quiu-
a while-not that youll have occasion
for violence with old milt but simply
as a small crumb of useful information
easy to swaller and not liable to set up
mental gripes-see let the expedition
advance

   about then the agglomerateds be-
gins to proceed toward the bosky dells
where old milt is -layin and every step
we takes the boys hesitates peers round
listens and shows the earmarks of a
disposition to beat it over the top of the
scenery at the first grumble

   all this aint lost none on our guests
as we comes to the woods and plunges
in professional dignity and human
scaredness comes to close grips in the
sheriffs heavin boozum and from all
indications the p d is all to the worse

   finn he aint much better off he
says atew remarks in shorthand or some-
thin and shows desires to constitute the
rear guard as for walker g he just
picks up a good stick and says nothin
such bein the different ways of nian
which man is a curious beast half mind
three-quarters foolishness and seven-
eighths animal after all when it comes
to a tight place

   well we plunges in as ive said
leavin the three visitors on the outside
of the woods and beats up round old
milt with just the hist-there-he-is-
now air as if the poor old dyspeptic
cuss was a royal ceylon man-eater

   we finds him easy enough-hes
layin down in a kind of dingle where
hes made himself a wallow when he
sees us he whines friendly and nuzzles
his paws

    look out careful  shouts el
 hes ripe for trouble

    stand back now everybody i
commands  drive him out easy dont
hurry him careful 

   seems like theres remarks from tin-
three men outside in the clearin but its
too far to hear what they say specially
as kid nagle then gives milt a short-
rib poke with a club and milt heaves t
his feet and grumbles off toward the edge
of the woods


the all-story magazine

  head him off there look out
there he goes watch them claws
turn him  turn him 

   such is the verbiage that floats out
to phipps and the other two whos neat-
ly bunched to head off bruin ahead of
us old milt plows along through the
underbrush some vexed at our prods
and also at colonels barkin round his
heels

   then he comes to the edge of the
woods and we sets up a comanche yell
rushes forward and projects milt in the
direction of our guests milt he breaks
into a lope the days hot and hes pant-
in trap hangin out long and drippy
colonel yaps himself almost into dog-
apoplexv

    head him  turn him   i screech-
es and the others all plays up to
me full bellows-power as we careens
out of the timber

   the sheriff when he sees this here
ursine panorama of wrath-to-come pi-
rootin for him head on turns a lettuce-
green wobbles makes noise and scrab-
bles rearward finnsky and w g
looks disposed to hit the high places
too but phipps manages to get sand
on the rail and finn hes more afraid
of bein afraid than he is of milt so
he makes a stand too

    head him off i yells again and
dog my cats if w g dont reely grip
his club and advance with old vike in
the rear on comes milt with a rush
surrounded by colonel on comes the
pair of heroes now milts within twen-
ty feet up goes the club milt sees it
and doubles w g closes in

    swish thud plumb on the
bowsprit

    boo-oo  milt quivers from bilge
to keelson rares up and makes an open-
handed swipe at v g- who turns just
in time to catch the claws in the part of
his pants he uses most when hes sittin
down

     r-r-r-rip 

    boo-oo swipe  and w gs club
flips thirty feet through the atmosphere
w g goes down in a simoom of dust
bear-claws eloquence and rags as the
hero falls he makes a grab and gets both
hands jiu-jitsued into milts fur

  help help comes a muffled
screech

   vike he aint so slow after all-he
does a baseball slide and lands on milts
quarter-deck likewise tanglin his talons
in the thatch

   now when a bears sprised hes
scairt and when hes scairt he runs and
when he runs he proceeds some rapid
and milt was sprised

   wherefore w g what aint got
sense enough left by now to let go rico-
chets and vike he ricofhets too such

 by alexander mcarthur

 j-jerein american honor de-
 ceived by slavic slyness is
 responsible for a catastrophe

had just turned into the nevsky
and was enjoying that wondrous
scintillating night-scene of rus-
sias winter city when a hair in
my throat made me put up my hand to
my mouth and cough thrice

  it was a purely accidental and un-
premeditated occurrence and i would
never have given the act a thought
only that some two seconds later a tall
individual in a long fur cloak the collar
well gathered about his chin approached
me and said in a mysterious whisper

j

   follow me

  newspaper training bad made me
quick of thought and action and even
as i asked myself  what the dickens
is this i turned on my heel and fol-
lowed him

  matters in st petersburg were for
the moment somewhat slow my col-
leagues and myself were forced to rely
on our imaginations and trust to luck to
pull us through our editors in new
york paid us for news and insisted on
getting it but as a matter of fact in
spite of rumors here there and every-
where nothing was happening or affair-
were so secret that none of us could get
wind of them

  at the same time we all agreed that it
was but the lull before the storm the
country was in the throes of a mighty
discontent and the wildest rumors as to
what was coming were afloat

  something was bound to explode we
told ourselves consolingly over our pipes
in the back room of the little cafe where
not a stones throw from the kazan
cathedral we gathered nightly

  as i followed the mysterious stranger
 felt satisfied i was at last hot on the
trail of this  something

  how lucky  had coughed three times
that evidently was the magic signal i
could not help cogitating on the triviality
of incidents that so often make up the
grave and tragic facts of life

  for months i had haunted the lowest
cafes and tea-houses of the vasily os-
troff  had treated the students lis-
tened to their raw debates acquiesced in
statements steeped in pessimism and
uttered sentiments-when i deemed it
safe and prudent-that would have
blown up the czars empire had they
been bombs

  but i could never get the confidence
of the nihilists nor ingratiate myself
into their sympathies others told me
my standing at the american embassy
always proved my stumbling-block

  but at last here was something for
my perseverance and instinct told me it
was nihilism

  we had reached the church of st
catherine on the nevsky and my leader
turned in i followed in the corridor
leading to the priests apartments he
turned and faced me

    you are somewhat early he said

   i nodded

   the meeting he began cautiously
 is not till one oclock you know
that

  again i nodded

  he seemed annoyed then he said
quickly

   how are they all in geneva

  this was a puzzler to me was it a
password or a question i queried of my-
self nervously

   i	looked him straight in the eye then

i	said tartly

   my dear sir i never talk silence
is always prudent

  for a moment he seemed taken aback
even frightened but after studying me
intently he laughed as one who enjoys
a huge joke

   straightening himself he said soberly

   but this is not business we must
make our plans the meeting is not till
one oclock and it is now only eight but
i dti not like to lose sight of you

   	im jiggered if i lose sight of you
was my instant reflection

  	 see you are in evening clothes
have you some engagement

    yes the ball at the gagarines

    ah  he cried as he threw open his
cloak revealing his faultless attire  then
it is easy i can wait for you in the
antechamber

   well all right i replied like a
chump falling into his snare

  nihilism or no nihilism i did not
want to miss the ball the salon of the
princess gagarine was the most delight-
ful in st petersburg the members of
the various embassies were sure to be
there-prince gagarine was minister of
instruction-and commend me to the
diplomatic corps for gossip i always
carried away a quiverful enough to give
me material for a dozen sunday sheets

   the name on your card is banks is
it not he next inquired

  the name on my cards was john
everett carrington

    banks yes i replied readily won-
dering what i should say if he asked me
to produce one

  he seemed relieved

  so was i

   but how does it come that you got
the invitation he asked eagerly

   oh i laughed mysteriously  that
is my affair

   well he went on buttoning up his
cloak  suppose we go to the rooms of
the society i want to get some papers

   as you like i answered as calmly
as i could what a story if i could only
once get there fate seemed too kind

  we left the building and taking the
first iswostschik without the formality of
bargaining my companion gave him the
number of a house on the nevsky
near by

   hardly necessary to take a sleigh
i interposed

   walking is always dangerous was
the sententious response

  we stopped before a house facing the
anitchkoff palace the residence of the
czar when in st petersburg
with the reds ix russia



  the dvornik allowed us to enter un-
challenged we passed into a hall but in-
stead of ascending descending we came
to a narrow passage which  estimated
must be at least six or eight feet be-
neath the level of the street all at once
my companion kicked three times-on the
wooden floor a moment later the
boards moved back as if by magic by
the light of the electric lamp my friend
carried i saw a long light of steps lead-
ing apparently into darkness

  come on he said seeing me peer
below  they are steep but i will go
ahead and count the number out to you

  i could hear a steady hammering and
pounding and the lower we went the
more distinct this sound grew there
mis the smell of earth-the clamp moldi-
ness that comes when it has not been
disturbed for years if ever before

  all at once it flashed across me the
nihilists were burrowing under the
nevsky-it had been rumored they were
so doing-burrowing to reach the czars
palace reaching out to do what they
had so often bombastically threatened

    blow the palace and all the royalties
in it to hades

  something cold ran down my spine

i felt myself grow pale it is easy to
write and discuss and tell of things but
when it comes to facing them that is
another matter  could feel myself
tremble

  a charge of dynamite and chaos
the czars immediate family destroyed
at one blow

  the scheme was colossal

   thanked god as i had done daily
since my arrival in russia that i was
not the czar nor of his entourage

  we reached the end of the stairs
traversed a long passage and entered a
vast damp chamber with lanterns strung
from a beam above a suave-voiced
person came to greet us

   ah officer b lie said extending
his hand

  my cicerone whispered something in
his ear whereupon he held out his hand
to me

   grasped it my teeth were chatter-
ing with cold

  a little beyond men were working
with lanterns fastened to their caps-
working with pickax and shovel some-

how tbe place reminded me of a mine
it had all the dreariness and ugliness
the smell of the earth they were dig-
ging and of the wood they were using
seemed the most penetrating odor that
had ever greeted my nostrils

  officer b took a small square pack-
age from a desk he put this in the
lining of his cloak then he embraced
his friend as one who goes on a long
journey-that is lingeringly and ten-
derly tears were in the eyes of both
tears in the tones of their voices

   was wondering why when officer b
said turning to me 

   we had better go now

  again he led the way again i fol-
lowed him at the head of the stairs
he pressed a spring we emerged reached
the nevsky and stood on the sidewalk
waiting for a sleigh

  my brain was in a whirl only one
thought was uppermost-how could i
best manage to get to a cable office

  get to it i was determined i had
a story that would startle new york
and every city in europe and america
on the morrow before the police of
st petersburg were awake the news
would be flashed to every point of civ-
ilization on the globe not for an hour
would i delay my triumph i would
certainly sacrifice anything to come

  when officer p told the is-vostschik
to drive to prince gagarines i halted
him and said as quietly as i could

   no let us go to the american cafe
behind the kazan cathedral we wont
meet any one there at this hour and if
we get to the palace by ten oclock it
will be time enough

  my companion did not seem pleased
but he assented and on our way down i
asked him what he thought of certain of
our american stocks

  he replied in a tone of indifference
that he knew nothing about stocks

  i tried to interest him and mean-
while laid my plan

  arriving at the restaurant i pro-
fessed hunger and ordered a rabchik
against which  russian appetite is
proof  this with a salad was soon put
on the table and the waiter brought me
tbe evening papers

  all at once after glancing hurriedly
over these i said quickly


the all-story magazine

   my friend you must pardon me for
a few minutes i must write cut a long
cable to my stock-breker those stocks
 -poke to yoa about you know

   oh yoa americans he said jooam-
fully  can you think of nothing but
money  

  i waved my hand at him jubilantly i
knew i could get my story off

  ten minutes later my -able was writ-
ten officer b read it as i could see
from across the table but it was a mean-
ingless jumble of words tc all except
two or three in th- office to which i was
sending it

  we finished our rai--aii and salad i
paid the score walked across to the tele-
graph office sent off my cable and en-
tered the sleigh my spirits rejoicing

  with nihilism i had never any sym-
pathy i needed it in my business i
made use of it and money out of it when-
ever  cv-uld but i loathed it as i loathed
all bloodshed

  sitting beside officer b i chuckled
over my luck in being able to fed one
of the most inhuman plots of which i
had ever read or heard i thought of
the lives in that great palace-the kindly
a ad gra-ious czaritsa the innocent little
grand take and grand duchesses playing
in their nursery i thought of what
might have happened but for that cough
of mine and i shuddered so that officer
e asked me if i was still cold

  we were at the palace before i knew

it

  a crowd of sleighs hemmed us in
all around us soldiers and police were
shouting out hoarse orders to the long-
suffering ifseesisekik

  officer b said hastily now you
get the information you came for and
leave me to lock after myself i will be
in the antechamber as arranged

  we entered and in the throng of peo-
ple officer b slipped away  got rid
of my cloak and after paying my re-
spect- to the hostess the beautiful prin-
cess gagarine i moved away to see who
had come and who of my old friends
were there

  as i was going from one room w an-
other marie wakwska touched me
sharply on the shoulder with her fan

   ivan petrowitch she whispered im-
peratively beckoning me with fnsr head

  that was how they addressed me in
russia  john the son of peter

  my heart began pounding mane was
adorable-the most beautiful girl in st
petersburg a poetess an essayist and
the special correspondent of a warsaw
paper therefore a brother in arms

  she knew my feeling for her tar too
well and treated me with a coquetry
that at times drove me wild and then
again would send me to the seventh
heaven of bliss  had never known any
one who could be so mercilessly cruel
and so enchantingly kind she had eyes
that hypnotized or repelled at will and
a voice sireaic in its low musical timbre

   i want to speak to you she said
quietly and i saw that the lines about
her rosy sensitive mouth were troubled

   pressed her hand tenderly but for
the first time in our acquaintanceship
she seemed to take no notice i could
not understand this i glanced into her
face anxiously

   how do you happen to be with
michaebn  she asked gravely

  miehaeen michaelm i re-
peated stupidly-  is that who t is 

  for a moment e could say nothing 
was too startled

   tell me-fell me she said impa-
tiently  this is a matter of life and
death

  i	first made sure we could not be over-
heard  then plunged into my story

   you poor boy they knew your pas-
sion for news and they used you
michaelin counted on your being blown
to atoms she said gently and her svf
little gloved hand touched me in a
caressing fashion that well-nigh drove
me delirious

   he is not in the antechamber she
said suddenly  he is among the
guests i saw him mount the staircase
a moment ago

  all at once she grew rigid

   put on your things and await me
at the entrance she said with the air
of one accustomed to be obeyed

   but why  why   i t-unmered

   ivan if you love me she whispered
in accents that sen a keen thrill of de-
light through my entire leing

   if you love me

  that nrvjuest from her would have
sent me to the inferno
  she left me i hurried to the ante-
chamber officer b was not there i
found my cloak and mystified but obedi-
ent left the building at the door 
met her anxious and distraught and to-
gether we entered her sleigh

  she gave her order and as we drove
off she turned to me

   do you know what you have done 
she asked me in english as her soft
brown eyes sought mine in an anguish
that terrified me

  a loud detonation in the direction of
the gagarine palace caused us both to
rise simultaneously in our seats the
driver looked back cracked his horses
with an oath then began to pray

  	a bomb  a bomb  cried several
terrified voices near us

   and you ivan you admitted the
man that brought it marie said with a
shuddering sob of horror as she hid her
face on my shoulder

  all at once i understood i remem-
bered the searching glance given my
companion by the policeman as we en-
tered the courtyard the look of relief
as the officer turning from my com-
panion recognized me

  the driver was still beating his horses
we were going like the wind there
was the dull glare of fire in the blue of
the skies behind us

  for the first time in my life my
equilibrium was shaken beyond my con-
trol

   i must go back i must see what i
can do there is my paper you know

    you will get it all at the restaurant
she said disjointedly  you must not
go back it is our lives now

   then  will leave you you must
not be seen with me i cried alive at
last to my danger and the result of my
ghastly mistake

   no i stay with you ivan petro-
witch come what may

  the sleigh stopped before her door
two men were standing on the curb-
stone as if awaiting us in russia when
two or three men are grouped together
it is apt to mean police surveillance i
saw i had marie in a trap i knew she
dared not and would not argue with me
just then i pressed her hand

   mademoiselle i said formally  i
will telephone you in an hour or two

from the restaurant and i will call to
see you early to-morrow

   thank you very much ivan petro-
witch she replied as she got out of the
sleigh i did not follow her i sat
where i was and when the isnostschik
tucked the fur coverings about me told
him to drive back to the palace

  a cordon of police guarded the streets
near by but my card admitted me
through the lines to my intense relief
i found all of my colleagues safe and
unharmed the atmosphere was heavy
with the suppressed excitement and
nervousness of the moment  learned
that prince gagarine was but slightly
hurt that several unfortunate soldiers
had been blown to atoms and that the
perpetrator of the outrage had stabbed
himself after he had thrown the bomb

  most of the windows in the palace
were shattered and owing to the explo-
sion the electric wires were not in work-
ing order even as i was speaking to
a syndicate man a body was brought out
on a stretcher it was officer b his
clothes showed the mauling he had re-
ceived at the hands of the crowd bend-
ing a tall burly soldier spat in the dead
face and the sullen murmur of curses
deep and bitter followed the body

   waited and waited wondering what
was next

  surely i told myself some one must
have seen us together officer b and i
the prefect of police came toward me
i felt that this was the beginning but
with a grave salutation he passed on

  after a while when it was certain that
there was nothing more to be learned
my colleagues and myself departed

  when we reached the restaurant one
of the group teased me because of the
pallor of my countenance

   you are a new hand carrington
he said  wait till you see a few more
of these sights and you will become cal-
lous

  i	smiled a sickly smile two minutes
later we were all busy with our pens

  any one know his name sang out
a voice suddenly

   michaelin i replied mechanically
and a moment later could have bitten out
my tongue at the admission

  not i in michaelin asked some
one
   i really dont know  replied

   well we will let it go at that said
our dean

  a few minutes more of scratching and
i rose my cable was ready and grab-
bing my hat i rushed out

  when  returned to the restaurant the
others had left i got marie on the tele-
phone and gave her the details of the
affair until the other newspaper men re-
turned when i closed the conversation

  we journalists sat at our own table
smoking and eating caviar sandwiches
and listening to the older fellows as they
regailed us with stories of intrigue and
nihilism that would make the flesh of
an oyster creep

  it was dawn when we separated i
went back to my rooms at the hotel de
europe and i did not feel safe even
when i had locked and bolted my door

  hong before noon next day i was
with marie she gave a great sigh of
relief as she saw me

 has anything happened she
queried eagerly

  	nothing i replied as yet

  she made me some tea then in whis-
pers we spoke of the events of the previ-
ous evening

   but you-how did you know about
michaelin i asked a dozen other
ideas surging through my brain mean-
while

   my friend i am a pole i have
ways and means of knowing things i
cannot reveal but it was from a nihilist
who loves me that i got the warning not
to go to the palace last night

   yet you did go 

   yes to pass it on to you

  marie marie

   ivas by her side in a moment

   then you do care a little no-
no-you care more i whispered in
breathless content as  put my arms
about her

   marie do you love me well enough
to marry me 

  the immutable smile of the polish
women that smile that dazzles and con-
founds at once bathed my soul in
ecstasy

   love she whispered  that is a
big word then she added carelessly
 but i think  like you well enough to
marry-perhaps

  the sorcery in her tone and in her
manner played havoc with my feelings
 knelt at her feet and kissed her hands

  she bent and kissed me polish fash-
ion on the eyelids then on the mouth

  when i came to my senses i was at
the american consulate in the sanctum
sanctorum of that august personage ut-
tering a rambling incoherent and abom-
inably disconnected statement of facts

   for heavens sake jack carrington
do stop blithering was the impatient
response that broke in on my overexcited
wits dragging me from the heavenly
bliss of love to the reality of every-day
business

   i am ready and waiting to tie the
knot no explanations necessary where
is the lady

  as  stood beside my bride i was won-
dering how it all had happened  re-
member urging the fact that at any mo-
ment i might be sent over the frontier
what really was worrying me was the
fear that marie might change her mind
so she had consented she must have
or we would not be at the consulate

  we spent our honeymoon of a week
in moscow-a week that the very angels
must have envied-then my consul sum-
moned me to st petersburg

  i was wanted by the prefect of police
before i left the consul i had told him
the entire history of the evening

  he looked grave

  humph he said slowly this
means banishment if not worse  will
communicate with the embassy at once
and head off these fellows

  the prefect received me as soon as i
arrived

   i am sorry mr carrington to have
to inform you that you will have to leave
the country within forty-eight hours

   what do you mean   i asked indig-
nantly what have you against me
what have i done

  done he echoed in his dignified
basso  why you sent that anitchkoff
palace story to america before we knew
of it

   burst out laughing

   and so because i saved your gzars
life you would banish me

  he rose dignified and stately

   mr carrington he said slowly
 putting ii in that light i think perhaps
 v    

loves crossway 		

 i	zt		

i can show you some leniency irat in
future be less hasty

  i	bowed inwardly chuckling of the
other affair he knew nothing therefore i
was safe in my haste to get home and
give the news to marie i stumbled over
one of my colleagues in the entry

  his face wore a sour and sullen ex-
press ion

   congratulations old man but
about that anitchkoff palace plot you
played us a dirty trick-keeping it to
yourself

   oh hang the anitchkoff plot i
cried airily  ancient history what of
it tell the boys to come round to-

loves c

by raymo

slight to celebrate  have another one
ty then 

   a word to the consul to prevent com-
plications there and i was at last steer-
ing for home

   marie met me her eyes like two stars
 i know-i know she whispered
  heard it from the prefects office ten
minutes ago

   i	looked at her in amazement in the
room with the prefect and myself had
been no one

   then i kissed her and laughed i did
not take the trouble even to question
her

   such is russia 

ross way

d s spears

  jn which mountain capulets and
  montagues fight and brawl
  with rifles and epithets 

two men rode down the steep
banks of muddy run and met in
midstream

       one was a brawny bushy-
whiskered man on a proud-stepping sad-
dle-horse while the other was a lank
youth whose angles showed that he had
not quite reached his full growth the
youths horse was a shaggy bony crea-
ture which seemed to have been often
exposed to the weather as the horses
reached to drink the man turned in his
saddle and faced the youth fiercely

   aint i tole you-all to keep away
from my girl he demanded  por
apron-stringed putterin shiftless no-
account boy what for you-uns think
teh go with her eh

   because i low she loves me the
youth drawled facing the man squarely
but without displaying any emotion

  the man gasped

   whats fiiat  he shouted

  then he plunged at the youth and
both fell from their horses into the run-

ning water where they fought rolled
over and over by the current till they
lodged on a grave bar ten rods down
stream there the man came uppermost
and pounded his opponents face to his
hearts content

  when he ceased the youth was limp
and insensible

  there clinr tazewell the man
said  i low nex time lon campbell
tells ye tokeep clear of his yoll mind 

  with that he rode away on his horse
while the shaggy mare snutiled over the
prostrate figure in the water wondering
what was the matter

  an hour later tazewell began to re-
cover consciousness he tried to open
his eyes but found them painfully swol-
len pe could feel the water lapping
against his clothes and gradually he
remembered what had happened

  the rough clinch at the ford the fall
into the water the struggle for foothold
and fist-freedom were recalled little by
little and a last he at up and held an
eye open to look about him there was
his faithful mare and up stream was
the gash made by the bridle-path in the
steep banks of the run

   law law  he muttered  that
man done whupped me he shore did
he beat me all up 
the all-story magazine

  he rose to his feel painfully climbed
to the saddle and clucked to the mare
telling her to go home making a sorry
figure as he rode along clinging with
both hands to the pommel his face
swollen and his clothes pulled and torn
awry two of his neighbors saw him
pass by but made no attempt to stop
or question him they had seen lon
campbell go down the road and they
had divined what had happened they
were surprised that young tazewell had
escaped with only a  beating up
arriving at his home clint dismounted
and turned his horse into the pasture
then he felt his way to the little log
house where his mother met him face
to face at the door

   my land clint what has hap-
pened she cried

   campbell-lon campbell don hit 
he answefed  he beat me up  

  the mother led her son to a chair
before the open fireplace and made him
sit down then she killed a chicken
and bandaged his face with the warm
meat next to his skin soothing him all
the while as he choked back the sobs
that came into his throat at last she
had done every thing she could for him

  thehl she said youll soon be
all right clinty

  jes wait tell i can see he gasped
suddenly jes wait tell i can see them
sights 

   oh clint  she said  dont
dont les don have no shootin up
hes her father shed never forgive
ye

  he made no reply and for days after
sat in ominous silence while the swelling
of the bruises gradually disappeared
leaving his face a ghastly yellow hue

  in a weeks time he was working
about the little place shucking corn
cutting wood and making things snug
for the winter day by day his mother
begged him not to arouse the wrath of
the campbells by killing their leader
her one convincing argument was

   his gal never will love you no
more if you kill him

  nothing else appealed to clint-much
less fear of the numerous campbells
he felt that there were not enough of
them to satisfy his lust for revenge on
the family which held itself so much

above the tazewells that they frowned
upon his courting pretty laura hut
of course he excepted her from the plans
of vengeance which he was secretly lay-
ing in his heart his mother convinced
him that he must see laura first

  the time came when he once more
crossed the ridges to the copper bottoms
where he sat down in the orchard on
the little knoll behind lon campbells
house the shades were down but a
bright light was burning within he
mimicked the whippoorwills song with
a low whistle it had never failed be-
fore but there was no answer to it now
he repeated it several times but without
avail the girl did not come never-
theless it was evident that the call had
been heard for the light was quickly
extinguished when his plaintive notes
quavered in the night

  clint waited long but no sound came
to warm his heart as he sat there
he realized that he had lost the girl un-
less he could  do something

   that mans watching her like a
hawk he said to himself  ill shore
have teh settle with him first yasseh 

  he turned homeward wondering just
what he had better  do-wondering
whether to go riding the bridle-paths
rifle in hand to kill his sweethearts fa-
ther or to  wait his chance it was
late when he climbed to his husk bed
in the garret of his home next day
his mother did not call him for she
knew he had been out late the night
before

  the morning was just half gone when
lon campbell rode up the bridle-path
to the widow tazewells little farm
she was at the spring-house drawing
a bucket of water when he arrived within
speaking distance

  campbell was not unacquainted with
mrs tazewell his errand that morn-
ing was not so much to seek clint as
it was to humble her pride he remem-
bered the time when the clintons were
set against him because he was poor and
no-account and though he had after-
ward  married well the memory had
never lost its sting especially now that
he wai a widower

  lida clintons charms had never been
entirely out of his mind and now that
she was ihe widow tazewell he longed
loves crossway

 do

to glery over her poverty and supposed
distress

  he saw her before she caught sight
of mm and had opportunity to notice
that her carriage was not less graceful
than it had been when she was a girl
as she turned at the sound of his horses
hoofs he noted that there was still a
saucy tilt o her nose and a poise to her
head which had always stirred the anger
in his heart it was so proud and inde-
pendent now the womans pride almost
pleased him he was so sure that he
could humble it by a threat

   look a hyar mrs tazewell he
began  whahs that son of youm i
ain got no hawd feelins agin you-all
but  tell you naow ef you don keep
that poh white-trash son of youm to
hum ill-ill-

   an whatll you do lon campbell 
the woman demanded with a toss of her
head

  the question and the way it was put
were so unexpected that campbell was
abashed the next moment the accumu-
lated wrath of years welled from his
heart and he cursed the family and the
son of the woman whom he had loved in
his youth

   that patched an gangling boy of
yournll shore git hurt if he don keep
away from my gal  he exclaimed  
got betteh ideas than havin her marry in
inteh side-hill pone-eaters an i tell ye
naow my gals got a sweetheart as has
money an clothes an sense he shore
has an you keep that clint tazewell
home i tell ye 

  the woman laughed in his face as he
jerked his horse around and drove away
down the bridle-path at a gallop the
way to the woods was not far fortunately
for him as he disappeared clint
sprang through the doorway rifle in
hand just too late to ge a shot

   clint clint  mtazewell cried

  it was a long time before she could
quiet him nor did she succeed until she
had explained the fact that campbell
had courted her in her youth her ready
wit divining the chief reason for camp-
bells visit she told her son that
campbells daughter was being courted
by some one else clirt listened quietly
enough and then said

    low id betteh see that man i

reckon i know him hes tip callo-
way he works in a store an wears a
white collar

  a few days later clint met tip on the
road between kyles ford and copper
bottoms

   naow see here mr tip calloway
clint drawled shifting his repeater from
the crook of his elbow  low they aint
no use of your cornin up this road no
moh you-alls rich but we-uns shoots
right smart yasseh we shoots right
smart

  tips pale face twitched but he was
not the kind of youth to make a fight
without a word he turned his horse
around to gallop back to kyles ford
there was much to dread from such a
lank red-looking mountaineer clint
grinned over his easy victory he had
expected a harder fight

  the experience with tip gave him
confidence for his struggle with lon
campbell who was a grown man much
feared by the timid souls of the region

  campbell supposed that he had cowed
clint till he heard that tip calloway
had been  run out of the country then
his wrath was boundless

  first of all he sent word to clint by
a neighbor that he was going to repeat
the beating that had taken place in
muddy run then he told his daugh-
ter what clint had done fancying that
clints impudence would make her as
wrathful as it had made him instead
it surprised and pleased her she had
willingly turned from clint when site
heard how he had been whipped by her
father not knowing that he had come to
see her one night when she was visiting
her aunt

  she knew now that clint cared and
that lie had courage that reached above
a mere whipping but the fact that her
father had threatened to beat clint again
frightened her she understood the
clinton tazewell spirit better than her
father did

   oh pop she said  whats the use
of whipping him again hes jest a boy
-an youre a big man besides-be-
sides-

  huh the man answered  ill
whip him twict as hard i shore will 

  the girl made no answer bat fear
came to her heart-the fear that her
lover would kill the man whose threats
were scattered in all directions now
the neighbors talked of the  trouble
wondering what its next turn would be
there was only one question any one
asked and that was

  whatll clint do will he let that
man beat him up again he caynt fight
him with his fists

  most of them thought clint would
shrink from fighting the man knowing
how many relatives there were to take
up the quarrel if clint should  go to
war -use his rifle that is but some
few iaura among the rest feared that
clint had just that courage-the courage
that would not count the odds against
him one day her fears were shown to
tie justified mabel green her dearest
friend brought her some news

   clints riding up an down the roads
a sight moren he used to do mabel
told her  mostly he has his rifle with
him but he aint saying anything to
anybody even his mother is plumb
scarrt up about what hes doing hes
that quiet an dont say anything even
to her

   lauras heart fluttered at this news

   hell kill him hell kill him she
cried to herself  pops so hard head-
ed i mustnt let him do it i
mustnt 

  that night laura did a strange thing
for a campbell to do

  she slipped out of her house and ran
up among the ridges to beg for mercy
from an enemy of her father she came
up the path to the tazewell clearing and
whistled-whistled like a mocking-bird
-a sound which she knew clint was not
likely to ignore

  clint was by the fireplace cleaning
his rifle he started but his mother
had turned her face to listen and so did
not notice the motion

  my land she said i never
knowed a mocking-bird to sing like that
this time of year before huh 

   hits a young un an i low ill go
ketch hit  clint remarked taking down
his hat as he pased through the door-
way his mothers face lightened up

   lawse  she said to herself
 hits some friend of hisn  might
of knowed 

  even she didnt dream of a campbell

coming at night to ask for what laura
was about to ask

  as the days had gone by campbell
had made more threats instead of
threatening to beat clint the fact that
the youth was carrying a rifle caused
him to carry his own-and he changed
the threat from a whipping to shooting
the youth only laura had dared to
interfere and failing with her father
she came to his intended victim

  as clint came to her in the bridle-
path she threw her arms around his neck
and began to cry clint could only gasp
and stutter

   dont kill my father she cried
 dont kill him hes all i got
mammys dead an youll kill him
dont clint dont

   hes got a gun to kill me with an i
low ill shore shoot back clint ex-
claimed  i aint never looked for
trouble with any man im peaceable
but they ain no man can run me around
like your dad lows to do ill shore
shoot if he draws down his gun i shore
will 

  the girl wept and begged but clint
would not agree to do anything she said
he would not even go away for a little
while till her fathers wrath had died
down weeping and sobbing she pulled
herself awav from her lover and started
down the road he followed trying to
explain why he could not do as she
wished but she only wept the more
he would promise her anything except
what she asked

  suddenly she seized him again

   oh clint promise me-dont kill
him-ies hit him in the leg or arm-
dont kill him 

  clint hesitated

   ill try not to he exclaimed and
then the girl ran down the path and dis-
appeared before he thought to accom-
pany her home

  for several days clint did not stir
abroad for his heart was moved more
by the girls plea than he was willing to
admit he was a good shot much bet-
ter than lon campbell for he depended
on squirrels and quail and wild turkeys
for most of his fresh meat and killing
game made him expert with his rifle

  he pleaded with himself that he was
merely  practising and not avoiding
loves cross way



a meeting but in his heart tie knew that
he did not want to kill a man much
less the father of the girl he loved
what two or three friends whom he met
told him did not quiet his apprehension
they said that campbell vowed to shoot
on sight

  but at last the meal was low in the
box and clint had to ride over to the
mill to have the grist ground taking
down his rifle he examined it carefully
and then started away just as the sun
lighted the trees on top of the big ridge

  his mother watched him go down the
path

  when he was out of sight she turned
to do the housework but the dragging
minutes were painful tragedy seemed
to be hanging in the air her thoughts
turned to lon campbell of all persons
in the world the one with whom she
wished her son to be at peace till then
the quarrel had not seemed real or dead-
ly but the whole force of the danger
was plain at last-the rumors the light
in muddy run the threats and at last
the careful handling of the rifle and
testing of the trigger proved to her un-
willing heart that it was only too true

  she had pleaded with her son  not to
mind but with as little avail as lauras
pleading with campbell had been

    i caynt let them fight  the woman
cried in her heart  oh what can i
do  what can i do  

  her son was obdurate but perhaps
she could prevail upon the man who
had been her sweetheart with that
thought she seized a little red shawl
and hurried down the short-cut path to
copper bottoms with swift pattering
feet she passed the mountain laurels
crossed the little runs scaled the ridge
cliff and ran down the long slope to
the campbell fields without stopping
or pausing she ran to the painted house
and opened the door without knocking

   laura was sitting before the fireplace
weeping and alone the girl looked up
and the next minute they were in each
others arms

    pops gone to the mill laura said

	hes ben gone an hour an more

  in anguish the women stared at each
other they knew from long experi-
ence in the mountains that a tragedy was
impending and they were powerless to

avert it trembling silent with tears
filling their eyes at intervals they sat and
waited

  the rustic of a chicken among the
woodchips behind the house the grunt
of a hog beyond the fence the shrill cry
of some bird made them start with ex-
clamations the clock ticked slowly
along each tick bringing the mountain
women closer to the saddest thing they
have to bear the rasping of wheels
and cogs the unlimbering of catches and
levers suddenly broke the monotone and
the clock began to strike

  a minute later from up the mill road
they heard three faint sounds

   spat spat spat 

   oh hes done hit hes done hit
hes killed my poh daddy the girl
cried springing to her feet in a paroxysm
of agony

  	 mebbe he missed mebbe- mrs

tazewell sobbed into the girls ears her
own heart misgiving her then they
wept together louder than ever

   clint had been the first to bring a toll
to the mill that morning others soon
followed however and clint found him-
self among neighbors whose silence
quickened his nervousness they merely-
greeted him but among themselves they
gave significant glances toward the rifle
he carried and more than one watched
the trail as though expecting some one
clint was glad to ride away on his mare
the lonely bridle-path was more com-
panionable than neighbors who won-
dered whether he would be murdered or
a murderer

   as he rode along the trail his indigna-
tion began to grow he asked himself
what he had clone that any man should
want to take his life

  im peaceable he exclaimed bit-
terly  i neveh harmed any man i
ain a bad mean man but that lon
campbell he alius has ben troublesome
he killed a man he whupped ole
leedin he whupped lise wheeler
he whupped me we neveh done him no

the all-story magazine

the corn-meal on the limb jjf a tree and
started down the path toward copper
bottoms as he rode his spirits rose
heretofore he had dreaded meeting his
tormentor but now he hurried his horse
toward the mans home he forgot the
girl for he was after vengeance now

  he passed the same houses whose oc-
cupants a few weeks before had seen him
riding past a wet bruised and dejected
figure the men women and children
saw him now and most of them under-
stood the difference in his bearing

  clints on the war-path ranee
wheeler exclaimed  i knowed hit
avnt in a tazewell or a clinton to be
undertrod an stomped on hue
thehll be a difference teh the echo in
this yeah fightin 

  eager as clint was for the meeting
it came sooner than he expected

  as he rode down the bank at muddy
run ford campbell came into sight on
the far side of the stream not thirty
yards away instantly campbell jerked
his rifle from its saddle holster and start-
ed to throw it to his shoulder while
clint startled and surprised merely
stared it was campbells opportunity
but he wasted it by firing without taking
aim the bullet tore through clints
hat as he brought up his own rifle to
take a quick sure  turkey shot

  campbell seeing the rifle come true
realized that he was facing death then
the sights dropped from the mans eye
and disappeared in smoke a blow like
a sledge-hammer landed on his elbow
followed by another  his knee his
horse reared threw the wounded man
and galloped into the brush the next
minute clint was beside his victim

   	i didnt low teh kill ye mars camp-
bell   clint said  i don aim to kill

ary man so i shot ye nice an simple like
i don want no bawd feelins becase

campbell exclaimed  you was plumb
reasonable with me yasseh thankee
lad ill ride yer mare home they ain

	hawd feelins no moh tell you
mah i asts her pawdon ive ben
mighty onmannerly with her

  steadying the man in the saddle clint
helped him homeward when they ar-
rived at campbells house the two women
were roused from their despair by a
shout they rushed to the door and as
they opened it clint called out

   come an hep maw you here
the three carried the wounded man
to a bed where they dressed his wounds
at last laura and clint slipped away

   i jes knowed youd be light on my
old daddy  the girl exclaimed hug-
ging clint spasmodically

   sh-h  said clint  whats that 
both heard a gentle  smack  in the
room where the man was lying

tle laugh  oh clint they ain no

 thether one takes a spoon
 or a house and lot a rob-
 berys a robbery for all of that

  i will not be- a party to this business
any longer its got to stop as far
as this family is concerned what
do you think my business associates
would say if they knew that my wife
and her friends went around nights
sneak-thieving 

  richard jones stock broker moderate
circumstances short fat and forty
stamped up and down his dining-room
indignation shining in his usually mild
blue eyes

  there were after-dinner coffee-cups in
great variety spoons knives and forks
ash-trays brass match-boxes wine-
glasses and salt and pepper bottles to
each article was tied a small card by a
narrow ribbon the cards were in-
scribed after this fashion

   the wimbledon oct 

                           charleys birthday

   woods cafe nov 

                          new years eve

   the beaulac

                            spring handicap

  and so they went on with little
parenthetical references to remind one
of some specially notable event as boys
and girls used to write in the corners
of the pages of autograph albums-
 blonde hair - apple dumplings -

 band concert -all greek except to
the initiated

   but richard it is not thieving pro-
tested pretty mrs jones who was
gathering from all parts of the house a
curious collection of articles of brass
silver and china ware and laying them
out on the dining-table until the room
began to look like an antique shop she
had been gazing at the collection with
pride and satisfaction until her husband
had entered the room with his protest

   well if its not thieving why dont
you help yourselves to a dollar or two
out of the till retorted jones with an
answer-that-if-you-can sort of a grunt

   oh but thats different there are
pleasant memories attached to these
things

   humph i dare say the proprietors
of the restaurants have pleasant memo-
ries of them but they are no longer
attached to them anyway so far as
this household goes its got to stop and

i	am going to stop it think of my
reputation as a business man suppose
on one of your souvenir nights when
you are all gloating and making merry
over your ill-gotten spoils a detective
should walk in and march us all off to
the station-house eh how would that
do for a pleasant memory i tell you
it is downright stealing

   now richard you know we all
spend a lot of money when we go out
together for an evening

   yes and then steal the restaurant
mans profits something on the line of
high finance i will admit but in this
case the law may reach you one of these
days

  jones swept the table with a con-
temptuous glance and strode out of the
house on the way to his office an idea
suddenly occurred to him he stopped
smiled broadly and slapped his knee to
emphasize his glee


the aii-story magazine

   ill do it he said half-aloud  it
will be a master-stroke ill bet it will
break up these souvenir-nights all
right

  chuckling to himself over his bright
thought he started on again

  jones himself had taken part in some
of these festive raids but as his house
and those of his friends began to fill up
with the spoils of the restaurants he be-
gan to consider the matter seriously and
when the display of each ones seasons
plunder was made the occasion of a
 party he protested

  he stopped again a policeman
turned the corner ahead of him and
walked hurriedly toward him it was
sergeant cahill of the precinct who was
under obligations to jones through
whose influence he had obtained his ad-
vancement from the ranks the robust
figure of the policeman fitted so nicely
into his plans that jones chuckled again

  just like an inspiration he said
smiling as cahill reached him

   did a man pass you under full
sail   the sergeant asked as he shook
hands with jones cahill had been a
sailor before he joined the force

  whats that asked jones

   scudding before the wind

   you mean cahill did i see a man
running nope no one passed me at
an accelerated speed and having fired
this back at the sergeant he figured that
he was about even

  	i wonder where he got to mur-
mured cahill

  where who got to asked jones

    slick bill i sighted him dead
ahead and clapped on all sail but he
has outfooted me somehow hes slick
all right

  want to arrest him

  no havent got anything against
him now i want to run him out of my
precinct he is dangerous

   well now cahill forget william
for a minute as long as he hasnt done
anything yet i want your help in a
little plan i have in mind

   you know you cant ask too much of
me if its in my way to do it said cahill
earnestly

  he was one of those peculiarly con-
stituted persons who remember a favor
after they have reaped the benefit of it

   now this is the case sergeant my
wife and a lot of her friends all decent
people you know have developed into
souvenir fiends

   um interrupted cahill  swiping
the pewter eh  

   yes i guess thats it only in most
cases it is more valuable than pewter
well you see they look at this as a
harmless little pastime and when they
get a good collection after a busy
season of dining out they give a series
of souvenir-parties-thats what they
call em cahill i give you my word-
at one anothers houses and display their
booty for the edification of their guests
now i want to stop it theres a
souvenir-night on at my house to-night

   and what do you want me to do
mr jones pinch the bunch

   no no cried jones in alarm  that
would be going too far what i want
you to do is to give them a scare dont
you know

   um said cahill very much as if
he needed more light

   this is the idea i want you to
come to my house to-night and demand
to search it for stolen goods that you
have been informed are secreted there
after indignant protests i will admit
you and you will go to the dining-room
which will be ringing with the joyous
sounds of mirth as my guests inspect the
display of souvenirs and recall to one
another the  pleasant memories that are
attached to them see

   then you will denounce the assem-
bled multitude myself included and tell
them that it is with regret that you can-
not arrest them all but that your orders
from the captain are simply to recover
the goods as the restaurant proprietors
wish to be lenient this time-but the
next-well the next time will be differ-
ent and in the meantime they will all be
under police surveillance wherever thev
go

  joness idea grew as he went along
and he had to stop to chuckle as he
thought of the consternation of his
souvenir guests

   and say cahill he continued
letting out another seam in his idea  in
order that the thing shall have a stronger
effect you insist on taking all of our own
silver from the sideboard
mrs joness souvenir-party



    captains orders -very sternly-
 you can come down to the house and
straighten it out with the boss-if any of
the stuff is yours

    throw a lot of sarcasm into the last
i will go down to the police station in
the morning and sort out our stuff and
send the rest back anonymously to the
restaurant keepers i think that is about
all cahill will you fix up the job
for me 

   um said the sergeant  want to
throw the gaff in hard dont you

    am not quite sure that  follow
you cahill said jones whose vocabu-
lary of slang was as limited as his
nautical knowledge  but i want to give
them a good strong object-lesson

   i am sorry mr jones that i cannot
do this for you myself but i am on the
desk to-night i will send up one of the
plain-clothes men though with a full
tip on the play

    well that will have to do then but
of course if you could do the thing your-
self i would have more confidence that
it would be handled with skill say
cahill -another bright idea had blos-
somed in joness fertile brain-send
up the gruffest and most insolent man
that you have on your staff it will
hit harder

   cahill looked grieved

   we dont have any insolent men on
the force mr jones he said in a tone
of mild rebuke

   oh i beg pardon  mean one who
can pretend to be insolent it will do
just as well

   all right i will send up a man who
will turn the trick as well as  could
and t will give him a hunch on the
gruff end of the game you wont find
him pleasant company

  thats it chuckled jones youve
caught my idea exactly send him up
after ten oclock then theyll all be
there to get their little lesson

   by the way i have forgotten the
number of your house said the ser-
geant taking his note-book from his
pocket

  number twenty-nine west -

street the sergeant made a note of
the address

  the men parted cahill to take an-
other look for  slick bill  while jones

highly elated at his scheme waited for
a car

  jones was in his merriest mood

  he welcomed his guests with the
warmest cordiality and no host could
have been more eager to entertain them
he moved about the rooms from one
group to another with a jolly tw-inkle
in his eyes and a ready jest upon his
tongue jones was surely at his best
one of the guests reported that he had
seen him sneak out into the hall and
chuckle to himself in a dark corner
mrs jones marveled at the transforma-
tion from the severe moralist of the
morning

  only in one way did jones violate the
laws of hospitality he glanced con-
stantly at his watch but as he did it
surreptitiously it perhaps should not be
recorded against him every time he
looked his chuckle became more and
more audible finally the last guest
arrived and all were seated at little
tables in the parlor it was a progres-
sive euchre night and as the bell at the
head table sounded the chatter ceased
and the players gave themselves up to
the serious task of fighting for the first
prize

  down at the end of the hall on a
side table in the dining-room the
souvenirs were displayed where before
supper was served the guests might
laugh and joke over the  pleasant mem-
ories  they recalled

  the silence in the middle of the
second hand was broken by a loud peal
of the front-door bell jones looked up
from his cards in surprise it was no
belated guest for all were accounted for
or present he looked at his watch
it was only half past nine cahill
has made a mistake in the hour thought
jones as he listened anxiously as the
maids footsteps sounded on the stairs in
going io the door

  whoever it was lacked a spirit of
patience for the bell rang twice again
before the girl could reach the door
with a common impulse every one
stopped playing and listened for de-
velopments

   perhaps babys been taken sick and
they have sent for me said one nervous
woman in a whisper to her neighbor
   i always feel creepy when our bell
rings like that its nearly always bad
news or a telegram those boys have
no consideration for ones nerves and
another woman began to show signs of
anxiety

  by this time the maid had opened the
door

  is this the jones joint a voice
inquired gruffly

  every one started at the coarseness
of the tone and question-every one
except jones

   cahill is on time he chuckled to
himself behind his handkerchief  now
the fun will begin

   i dont know what you mean re-
plied the maid tartly

  oh well does jones live here

   mister jones lives here said the
girl with proper emphasis on the
 mister

   tell the boss i want to see him and
dont keep the law waiting in the hall
either my pretty maid

  there were cries of astonishment from
the guests and jones rose from his chair
with well-assumed amazement

   the law he gasped  what can
it mean

  jones was a good actor

   my dear i will see this person he
said turning to his wife  do not be
nervous it is some mistake of course
please excuse me for a moment

  he bowed ceremoniously to his guests
and left the room

  just inside the hall-door stood a tall
heavily built man with his coat-collar
turned up around his neck and his
slouch hat which he did not remove
drawn down over his eyes he carried
a large market-basket on his arm

  you may go bessie said jones to
the girl who seemed inclined to stay
and see the play to its climax as she
turned away jones winked merrily the
man returned the courtesy

  well sir said jones the comedian
in a pompous tone  to what felicitous
circumstance am i indebted for this
visit 

  are you jones the man winked
again

   i am mr jones

  another wink and the signals having
established them on an ecfual footing of

understanding the play moved rapidly

on

   well youll do and if you arc trying
to ask me what i want ill give it to
you straight i want them sooveneers
you and your fine frens swiped-an i
want em quick sec  

  jones heard gasps of fear and amaze-
ment from the parlor and he knew his
lesson was sinking in how he did want
to laugh

   but my dear sir he said with a
fine show of perturbation  i dont know
who you are

 who i am im gallagher from
the precinct station and de sergeants
orders are to bring back the stuff or
youse you can shake dice to see which
but youve got to be quick about it

   but my dear sir-

  none o yer dear sirs now jones
get busy ive got orders to search de
house-an wid de aid of a gun too
now run along sonny and put me next
to de stuff or ill pull in de whole
caboodle of yer

  more gasps from the parlor

   there lias been some grave mistake
said jones with dignity which was some-
what marred by another wink if you
will step this way i will show you some
trifles that my friends and myself have
picked up during some jolly evenings
around town but i assure you they were
all well paid for in the restaurant bills
we had to settle

  jones with his head held high in the
air led the way followed by the man
into the dining-room

   i shall see my friend sergeant cahill
in the morning and somebody will suffer
for this outrage i assure you my dear
sir

   aw quit yer kiddin-it was cahill
sent me

  they entered the dining-room and
jones turned up the gas

   sooveneer blowout says cahill
an i guess he hit a four time winner
commented gallagher as lie glanced
quickly around the room he went
straight to the side-table where the sou-
venirs were tastefully displayed and
quickly picking out the tableware
dumped it into the basket he carried

   never mind the crockery says
cahill  let em keep that 
mrs joness souvenir-party

   having cleaned off the table of every-
thing except the cups and glasses galla-
gher turned his attention to the side-
board with another wink at jones which
was promptly returned accompanied by
a low chuckle

  by this time the guests with mrs
jones in the van quaking with fear and
anxiety but drawn by a strange fascina-
tion to the scene had flocked out of the
parlor and gathered at the dining-room
door they were wondering how soon
their own homes would be visited by this
coarse detective who was so rough in his
manners

   evenin folks said gallagher with
a broad smile that encompassed the
whole gathering  sorry to bust up yer
little party but laws law

  again the guests trembled at that
dreadful little word and gallagher con-
tinued to toss the silverware from the
sideboard into his basket then he
opened the drawers and piled in hands-
ful of knives forks and spoons by this
time the basket was full and mrs jones
had recovered her speech

   richard she cried hysterically
 you are not going to let him carry away
our own silver

   sorry my dear but those are his
orders dont worry  i will straighten
this all out in the morning with my
friend cahill

   but some of those things he is ta-
king are our wedding presents you
know that

   you and jones here may know
maam but how am i to know em
from soovies down to the station theyve
got to go evenin ill see you all
later

  gallagher eased the basket on his arm
and marched triumphantly through the
lane made by the guests who drew back
to let him pass in another moment the
front door opened and closed after
gallagher and the  soovies

   there was a long silence during which
the guests looked anxiously at one
another and jones choked an almost
irresistible desire to laugh by a violent
spell of coughing after the departure
of gallagher mrs jones had vainly tried
to find her tongue again but could only
utter little gasps

    its retribution said jones drawing

down the corners of his mouth  this
settles the souvenir habit for me
there were responsive murmurs of
 me too while the nervous woman
added the final touch to the situation by
seizing her husbands coat-sleeve frantic-
ally and saying in a stage-whisper

   that horrid man said he would see
us again later do you suppose he is
going to our house  

  consternation spread itself thickly
over the assemblage there was a sud-
den scurrying for coats and wraps and
hurried and excited apologies to host
and hostess

   really we must be at home in case
that awful man does come hell simply
turn the house upside down if we are
not there and think of the servants
oh dear dear what a scandal

  within ten minutes the last guest had
departed and jones sat down among
the deserted card-tables and gave full
license to his pent-up merriment he
laughed loudly and he laughed long
while mrs jones restrained threatening
tears in amazement

   richard she cried  what can you
find to laugh at in this terrible situa-
tion 

   its all right my dear another joy-
ous outburst its all right t did it i
said i would and i did you know what
they say about me in the street  another
merry intermission when jones says he
will do anything why its just as good
as done

   i dont understand you richard
you did it you did what

   yes i did it cahill and i fixed
it up between us-sergeant cahill you
know him-the one i got promoted

   and do you mean to tell me rich-
ard jones that this-this was all a
farce demanded mrs jones angrily

   yep replied jones jauntily  i
shall go down to the station house to-
morrow get our things and send the
 soovies back where they belong

  jones touched himself off again and
was about to explode when a danger
signal in his wifes voice caused him to
snuff out the fuse

   and do you mean to say mr jones
that that awful creature is going to con-
tinue this little play of yours at the
houses of mv friends


the ail-storv magazine

   dunno-hope so doesnt he act
the tough policeman well that was
a little thought of mine in fact the
whole scheme was mine clever wasnt
it careless of the consequences and
ignoring the icy stare in the eyes of mrs
jones he went off again into a burst of
laughter

  the front door-bell rang again jones
glanced at his watch it was quarter
past ten probably one of the guests in
his hasty departure had forgotten some-
thing he opened the door himself a
heavily built man with a slouch hat
pulled over his eyes stood on the stoop
in many ways he resembled the previous
caller and when he spoke the likeness
was strongly emphasized

  does jones live here he asked
huskily and in the dim light from the
hall jones could see him wink

   step right in said jones in amaze-
ment mechanically returning the wink
 is cahill going to send up the whole
station house

  whole station house what do you
mean mr jones you of course know
what i am here for

  the new-comer had dropped his gruff
tone

   but gallagher was here not half an
hour ago and carried off the stuff

   gallagher 

   one of your detectives

   but we havent any gallagher on
the staff

   eh no gallagher big man looks
something like you and wears a slouch
hat same as you do pulled down over
his eyes

   not in our precinct

   would cahill have selected a man
from another precinct

   as this job is a joke in which he is
lending you the services of the police
department i dont think he would take
that chance and if he had why should
he send me this is not a little practical
joke of yours mr jones the detective
added suspiciously

   no no cried jones excitedly
 this is getting away beyond the mer-
ry stage can  get cahill on the tele-
phone 

   you cant but i can where is your
phone 

   right down the hall and jones

led the way in a wild dash for the in-
strument the detective after going
through a mysterious formula succeeded
in getting the connection with the station
house

   is that you sergeant this is
morrison im at mr joness house
hold the wire he wants to speak to you
here you are sir and morrison handed
the receiver to the excited jones who
opened up his batteries without delay
this is what morrison heard of the
conversation

   that you cahill

   got any more detectives on the way
to my house

  what do i mean yes i know i
am excited

   get down to facts thats what
i am doing you sent up gallagher
who plays his part very successfully and
carries off the stuff then morrison
appears is this a joke

  whos gallagher thats what i
want to know who is gallagher

  only sent morrison then who in
-who sent gallagher

   no never mentioned it to a soul

   n - o dont recollect seeing any
one oh yes come to think of it sev-
eral minutes after you left me and while
 was waiting for a car a man left the
hallway of the building in front of which
we were talking

   couldnt tell you how he looked

   oh gallagher well there wasnt
much distinctive about him rather a
tough-looking citizen but that was in
line with our plans oh yes there was
something i noticed he had a small
mole on the end of his nose-

   whats that dont swear cahill-
they will cut us off

   police wire oh all right

  whats that ive been robbed
gallagher was  slick william and he
was the man in the hall  oh lord oh
lord 

   morrison said jones in a low and
pleading tone as he turned away from
the telephone  theres a hundred dollars
in it for you if you can get that stuff
back before mrs jones finds out what
a fool i am

   mrs jones knows already came a
steely voice from the darkness of the
parlor

     i suffered about  years of that time with nervous sick-headache
often spending  days of each week in bed if i went out one day id
likely spend the next in bed-so nervous life was not altogether happy as
one can imagine

     seven years ago i left off coffee and commenced drinking postum
