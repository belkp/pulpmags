by francis cockrell

illustrated by l r gustavson

you read about a golf tournament
you read about the national open
say you find out who won if
youre interested enough you find out
who were second and third and where
your favorite finished maybe you read
about all the great holes that were played
and the disastrous holes that were played
but you dont know much about what
happened

  maybe you read about dan kalik that
year maybe you were actually there
and saw it with your own eyes maybe
you were one of the hundreds jammed
around that eighteenth green you still
dont know what happened what was
going on

  dan kaliks old man was a coal-miner
he was big and tough and had tre-
mendous shoulders and arms he loved
to fight he was a prize-fighter and a
good one for a year but the hands that
went with his huge arms and shoulders
were brittle a year was their limit

  just a week after his last fight john
kalik his wife and son came down with

flu bad they were sick a long time
little dan just missed dying when
john kalik was well enough to work
again the money he had saved in that
year of fighting was ill gone he went
back to the mines because they paid bet-
ter than anything else he knew how
to do

  dan kalik was a kind of scrawny kid
thin you know and not very strong
that flu hadnt done lim any good and
in those days the kaliks never did have
enough of the kind of food growing kids
really should eat they were saving
money you see-a stake so that big
john could get out of the mines and
into something with a future

  so he was glad when dan the sum-
mer he was ten got a job caddying over
at the country-club dan was a quiet
kid they never even knew he was cad-
dying until he began bringing the money
home and giving it to his mother

  somebody gave dan an old mashie
with a badly warped shaft when his
father came home from work that day
dan was out on the dumps behind the
two-room shack they lived in with the
club and some old ci t-up balls he had
found he had just hit one that soared
straight and clean out over the dumps
and when he looked up at his father his
black eyes were bright and shining and
excited in his thin little face

  john kalik saw his sons eyes but he
didnt know how he felt john kalik
didnt know what it was like to get hold
of one just right for the first time

  he said look here kid i guess this
caddy stuff is all right-youre makin
good money for a bo  but if you want
to play something why in blazes dont
you get out and play a real game  why
dont you go down to the y and learn to
box or play baseball or football or
something somethin that takes a little
guts thatll help make a man out of
you golf he ended contemptuously
the moving story of a	

coauminer s stripling son	

whose courage made him	i

    famous overnight

  you saw dan ka-
  iik minimize the
  wind and rain
  in every way he
  could-and you
   thought this
  kids not lucky
  hes just a fine
  goiter

  dan kalik stood there looking at his
father and that light went out of his
eyes after a second he licked his lips
once then he took the club and the old
balls and went in o the house he didnt
say anything at all

  john kalik stcod for a few moments
with a frown on his face he was sorry
he had said that he remembered how the
kid had looked but to come home and
find him playing aroiond with a sissy
game like this golf-it was bound to get
your goat a little you couldnt help be-
ing a little disappointed

  john kalik never mentioned golf after
that dan kalik didnt either there
wasnt much corrmunion between those
two the next ten years they had never
been very close-john kalik and his son

  you see john kalik loved this boy
but a man wants more than that he
wants to be proud of his son and john
kalik couldnt be it wasnt that dan
was never quite as big as the other kids

 his age or quite as strong but he was
 so quiet he never got into trouble he
 never came home with a black eye and
 once john kalik heard another boy out
 behind their shack announce to dan
 that he could lick him

   john had stood there in the window
 watching from where they couldnt see
 him holding his breath and he had
 heard his son refuse to fight turning
 from the window john kalik thought
 he hasnt got any guts being little
 that aint his fault he takes after mary
 that way i guess but he hasnt got
 any guts

 john kalik was ashamed of his son
 he loved him but he was ashamed of
 he never talked to anyone about
the blue book magazine

his kid-in those days and he didnt
say anything more about golf because
a boy needed exercise and he guessed a
game like golf was probably the only
way the boy would ever get any

  dan kalik thought his old man was
the greatest man in the world he
wanted to be just like him and make
his old man proud of him he felt pret-
ty gloomy for a long time after that day
he had refused to fight maybe he was
yellow he thought but he hadnt want-
ed to fight he hadnt been mad at the
other boy he wished he had gone on
anyhow and taken the licking he would
have taken from the bigger kid but he
hadnt

  dan knew his old man thought golf
was a sissy game and because of that
dan thought it was too so he never
mentioned it again when his father was
around he never hit old balls out over
the dump when big john was at home
he never had a golf-club in sight around
the house    but he went on playing
golf

  he went on playing for those moments
that make you feel as though you are ex-
panding inside as though you are get-
ting lighter  that make you feel time has
stopped that the whole world has
stopped and youre sitting on top of it
and its yours those moments that
come right after the sharp clean crack
of wood the low straight flight and the
long bounding roll of the ball when
youve smacked one just right from the
tee that come right after the crisp
click of iron and the high graceful arch
of a ball that bounces once on the green
and settles near the cup that come right
after an intentional hook catches the
bend of the fairway and following it
digs in and rolls down the middle to
leave you an easy pitch

dan got along well at the country
club people liked to have this
quiet kid caddy for them he rarely lost
a ball he always knew how far it was
from one point to another he could tell
what kind of roll youd get that day
the stewards liked him and because he
always seemed sort of frail they made
a point of feeding him up the pro
liked him and let him hang around the
shop when he wasnt caddying because
he never got in the way and he was al-
ways thinking of little things to do that
were a help

  dan gradually accumulated clubs the
caddies could use the practice fairway

in the morning if they got there early
enough dan always did dan won the
caddies tournament when he was six-
teen and again when he was seventeen
after that he was no longer a caddy
he had finished high school then and
jake bushnell the pro gave him a job
in the shop

john kalik wasnt in the mines now
after five years with dan buying all
his own clthes and bringing a little
money home besides and with mary
dans mother doing everything she could
to save money wher a chance turned up
for john kalik to get out of the mines
there was enough for him to do it

  there were a lot of roads being built
then a friend of johns had also saved
a little money and together they made
the down payment on a bunch of de-
crepit old trucks and got a hauling con-
tract on one of those road jobs they
came out all right they got more trucks
and more contracts they made money
they hooked up with an engineer and
bid on small road jobs but they were
always working on a thin margin al-
ways growing and branching out and
there was never much extra money

  not enough to send a boy to college
so dan kalik took the job in the golf-
shop jobs were scarce then he was
lucky to get it

  dan hadnt changed much he was
still quiet he still thought his old man
was wonderful and wished he could have
grown up to be jusl like him and be-
cause he knew his eld man still thought
he had no guts dan kalik still felt un-
easy about that himself and wished that
he could do something to prove that he
did have and felt drearily certain that
he never would

  he went on playing golf he knew
big john thought it was a game for
sissies a game that took no courage
he thought so too you see dan kalik
thought of courage as a purely physical
thing and you couldnt get hurt play-
ing golf no one would black your eye
no one would split your lip

  but he went on playing because he
loved the game he felt guilty about it
but that didnt change things he loved
it anyhow and his game got good-
very good he was still slender and
rather frail-looking five eleven and he
only weighed one forty but he took
a free easy swing and he could hit two
fifty off the tee and split em down the
middle too on days when he was right
three thousand or bust

  the summer lie was twenty dan ka-
lik qualified to go to the national open
the elimination for his district had been
held at his own club he had caught
a couple of those rounds when you cant
do wrong and taid qualified

  big john kalik drove home this sum-
mer night with a concrete-mixer that
needed repairs there was a weary sag

dan helped him and the job didnt take
long though neither of the kalik men
had any special genius with machinery
when they had finished john wiped his
hands with a wad of waste and looked
thoughtfully at the younger man son
he said have you got any dough
ive got two hundred dollars dan
told him maybe a little more

i dont guess john said -i dont
guess you could borrow any i dont
guess you know of any of those rich guys
over at the club thatd like to gamble a

f

to those heavy shoulders and there were
tired lines in his face the firm need-
ed money-needed it quick and there
was no place to get it he was going to
fix the mixer himself because he couldnt
afford a repair man every nickel they
could get on their equipment on per-
sonal loans in any way they had already
got and it was not enough still work-
ing on a thin margin they had bit off
too big a bite the biggest yet and
they could have made it too if luck
and the weather had been playing on
their side

  but they werent there had been
three weeks more of rainy weather that
spring than wa the average for this sec-
tion mixers had broken down one
thing after another that ate up time and
ate up money this job would have put
them over on easy street if they could
have pulled through but they couldnt
now and everything they had would be
gone they would be back where they
had started or worse

  after supper big john went out and
worked over the mixer by lantern light

look here kid said
john why dont you
get out and play a real
game-somethin that
will help make a man
out of you

little three thousand danny and we
come through otherwise-we cant fin-
ish we go bust

  no dan said slowly no i dont
know any im afraid

  john kalik nodded listlessly yeah
i wasnt countin on it well-well if
you want to let me have that two hun-
dred-its not much but itll help us
hang on awhile longer

  dan stood there staring at the wrench
in his hand and he didnt answer for a
little he had had no intention of going
to the open when he had qualified he
knew what kind of chance he would have
against that competition the cream of
the best golfers in the world


the blue book magazine

  now he said i guess ill play in the
open two hundred wont help if you
need three thousand but itll pay my
expenses and the national open he
added is worth forty thousand to the
man who wins it

  forty thousand   john kalik blinked
you mean theyve got a forty-thousand-
dollar prize in a golf tournament

  not the prize dan said its just
five hundred but you get exhibitions
endorsements and stuff like that and
some of it-some of its quick money
john kalik was silent a moment
then if you could win-if you could
win that danny-

  if i can win dan said soberly itll
be a miracle but i can go play i can
do that

so dan kalik went to the national
open and john kalik who thought
that golf was a sissy game and that this
slender son of his had no nerve-john
kalik went along to watch for in this
tournament was the one slender hope
that all his work and sweat of these fif-
teen years might not have been for noth-
ing-

  for two days john kalik walked in his
shirt-sleeves over green grass and around
pits of sand in the stifling breathless
heat of a high summer sun he walked
and watched his son play golf he
wondered why the kids lips grew gradu-
ally tight and thin why those tired lines
came into his face it looked very
smooth and effortless when dan hit a
ball john kalik thought

  it was smooth and easy dan kalik
knew when you hit them right but he
also knew how hard it was to make it
easy you have to think about your
shots-about hitting them right but
you cant worry about them

  john kalik didnt know that he didnt
know that once you let your imagination
get things in hand youre sunk that
once you begin to think what if i
miss-that once it begins to occur to
you that you may miss-then youre
due to start missing shortly

  he didnt know about the strain the
national open puts on a man its not
that you may come to where forty thou-
sand dollars hangs on a stroke so long
as youre still in the running forty thou-
sand hangs on every stroke every time
you pick up a club youre faced with a
chance to boot away a fortune

  dan kalik knew about that though
and he knew something else that unless

youre one man in a million or maybe
its ten million theres only one thing
thatll enable you to stand up under it
you have to learn you have to practise
you have to undergo that strain until its
an old story until you can go out there
and play with it hanging over you and
still keep it out of your mind and not let
it affect your muscles you have to have
tournament experience

  and dan kalik d dnt have any

  so dan kalik knowing he couldnt
think about his gan e without thinking
about it too much went out there and
tried not to think about it at all be-
tween shots he tried to remember dreams
he had had and the words to songs he
tried to do algebra in his head and to
make up limericks when he came to
his ball he would try to believe it was
just a practise shot and that it didnt
matter whether it came off or not

  and it worked that first day he got
into trouble but he got out again he
was good at that he had a 

  the next day though was different
the next day it began to get him it
was bound to but also the next day
luck came and sat on dan kaliks shoul-
ders and rode there around the course
two long putts curved in and an off-
line pitch headed for a trap hit a tree
and bounced onto th green to leave him
an eight-inch putt and the round that
should have been in the eighties was a
 and dan kalik had qualified for the
last days play

that last day when they play thirty-
six holes the low sixty and ties
sixty-four of the words best golfers sea-
soned tournament players and a kid no
one had ever heard of a kid who was
thirty-one on that list when the last day
started nine strokes below the great jim
forest who was in tie lead

  john kalik in these two days began
to have a vague feeling of uncertainty
about this game he had derided so and
as he watched these men play it grimly
that feeling grew for here was no
bunch of softies fooling around with a
game for girls these were men with hard
muscles and level eyes and a fighters
look about them

  and when he watched dan hit a ball
that went straight and long and then
hit one that curved into trouble john
kalik couldnt see any difference between
the swings at all he began to get a
faint idea of what his son was up against
the game was so delicate the difference
three thousand or bust

 son john asked have
 you got any dsugh
 three thousand danny
 -and we come through
 otherwise we go bust
 dan said slowly two
 hundred wont help if
 you need three thou-
 sand but itll pay my
 expenses in th na-
 tional open

 between a perfect shot and a bum one
 was so slight hell you couldnt even
 see it

   and during dinner that night sitting
 there with this frail kid of his across the
 table from him so silent with his black
 eyes somber and the lines of strain so
 evident in his thin face john kalik
 wanted very much to help him wanted
 to say something to make this easier for
 him but there was nothing he could
 do of course

   once he said  dont worry about the
 dough kid it doesnt matter if you
 dont win it wont kill anyone you
 know

   but that didnt help for those were
 just words of course and dan kalik
 knew they were he knew what it would
 mean to his old man to lose everything
 he had worked for during fifteen years
 and almost won and now dan had for
 the first time a chance to do something
 for him not something that would make
 big john so very proud of him of
 course that would prove he was tough or
 had a lot of courage he had no hope
 of that but it would be something im-
 portant just the same and would help
  to make up for the other

   but it would be that only if he won
 and dan kalik knew what his chances
 were the more you want to win the

harder it is to keep from tying up the
tougher the strain and he was a green
kid playing against hardened experts

  maybe you saw that open you may
even have seen dan kalik shoot his
second round he was playing with
hagen that day and the haig was
blowing hot and had a big gallery

  you didnt see his third round thats
a cinch you probably didnt see any-
ones third round if you were there
you remember why you didnt of course

  you remember how it was when the
first ones were starting off still so very
still and hot and muggy you didnt
even move but sweat would rise up on
your skin and stick your shirt to your
back

  so still and then you remember
those first little swirling breezes that
rippled the smooth grass of the fairways
and fluttered an old score-card across
the first tee

  you remember the first drops of rain
huge scattered drops that fell around
you with heavy little spats

  then the storm the downpour you
were in the clubhouse then of course
you stood at a window maybe but you


the blue book magazine

   now you may have seen dan kaliks
 fourth round you may have been one
 of the dozen who thought its just a
 freak the kid cant hold up but just
 the same goofy things happen in the
 open ill get wet and have a look hes
 in striking distance now and with
 another round like this morning-

   so you went aloig and you saw that
 round and youve talked about it so
 much since then that you can recite it
 stroke by stfbke still you didnt know
 what was going on and you dont yet

didnt see dan kalik starting off on his
third round the first tee was only
fifty yards away but you didnt see him
you couldnt see fifty yards in that rain

  big john kalik saw him big john
kalik walked around those eighteen
holes a one-man gallery he was drip-
ping wet from head to foot he didnt
notice it that wind whipped rain
against his face it came in cyclonic
gusts and flapped his wet shirt against
his back and stung it big john kalik
didnt notice it

  you remember the scores that morn-
ing-  -lots of those rain
washing men out of the open wind
blowing their hopes away you remem-
ber  was low score it was low until
this kid you hadnt heard of before came
in with a 

 he started to bring his
 club back for the pitch
 nc the tuft of grass
 under his foot gave way
    for what seemed
 minues he stood look-
 ing ilown at his club
 he liad grounded it in
 a hazard

you saw him tee his ball very low
almost touching th wet grass you saw
it go out a hundred yards flying low and
then you lost it ir the rain but you
thought too far to the right that
wind will take it into the rough

  but when you fallowed him straight
down the middle of the fairway two hun-
dred and forty yards there was his fore-
caddy standing beside the ball then
you knew the ball had started hooking
after you lost sight of it and the hook
had balanced the wind and held it in the
middle and you thought pretty
lucky

  its a long par four that first hole
you saw that spoon shot it was very
high and to the left of the hole but
this time it didnt hook it was straight
and the wind got it and drifted it twenty
yards and dropped it on the edge of the
green and it didnt roll three feet then
while you watched this kid get down in
three thousand or bust



 two putts you were thinking maybe
 that hook was intentional to get the
 extra roll on this long hole and the spoon
 shot without hook because he didnt
 want any roll when he landed on the
 green maybe he knows what hes do-
 ing

   when you saw him on the next tee
 with the wind against him not even tee
 his ball and use his driver and then
 use his driver again off the fairway
 neither of the shots ever getting ten feet
 above the ground minimizing the wind
 you were pretty sure he knew what he
 was doing and vihen you saw him on
 the third hole tee the ball high and use a
 brassie lifting it high into that carrying
 wind for a three-hundred-yard tee-shot
 then you knew very well he knew what
 he was doing then you were beginning
 to be glad you had come

 it was worse that afternoon the rain
 came in fitful bursts there would be a
 lull then a deluge but the wind was
 high and steady new blowing thirty-five
  and forty miles an hour whipping the
 rain about you and about dan kalik in
 thick blinding sheets stinging against
 your face but you were glad you had
 come anyhow

   you saw that round of golf and you
 wont forget it you saw this slender
 frail-looking kid with the free easy
 swing that got such shocking distance
 you saw him minimize the rain and wind
 in every way he could and make the
 wind help him too when that was pos-
 sible and you thought this kids
 not lucky hes just a mighty fine golfer

   and you were riht about his being a
 fine golfer that day but you were wrong
 about his not being lucky because you
 still didnt know what was going on

   dan kalik didnt know then either
 dan kalik figured it out later when he
 thought about it he saw how it hap-
 pened but right then jje didnt think
 about it because he was too busy

   the rain that blinded you and made
 the club-grips wet and slippery for those
 sixty-five golfers that left casual water
 everywhere that slowed down the greens
 and made the fairways soggy and cut
 down the roll that was lucky for dan
 kalik the wind that stung the rain
 against your face that carried the ball
 with it or shoved it back or drifted it
 off-line that was ucky for dan kalik
 too

   for you see dan kalik was good at
 getting out of trouble a trouble shot is

 an unusual shot you have to do some-
 thing different there is generally one
 and only one way it should be played
 but there is always that one and dan
 kalik was good on those shots because
 he had a strong and vivid imagination

  when he came up to a trouble shot he
saw that one way immediately his mind
leaped to the variation he had to make
from the normal and his mind was so
full of that picture there was no room
for anything else on a regular ordi-
nary shot his imagination had no work
to do and worry would slip in what
if i miss and i cant miss he
would play as he had the day before
when only luck had saved him

  but now today you couldnt find a
normal shot on this whole course and
because of that because each shot was a
new and different problem that filled his
mind entirely dan kalik shot two
weirdly perfect rounds of golf

  maybe that sounds queer maybe you
think why didnt it work the same
with the other men in this tournament
the answer sounds even more queer
they were better golfers they had had
more experience

  tough shots were old stories to them
they knew how to play them without
even thinking from experience so
all they saw was the trouble all that
came to their minds on tough shots was
that their chances of missing were great-
er and that helped them miss

  but if lucky breaks had pulled dan
kalik through that shaky nervous round
the day before and this queer luck of an-
other kind had helped him today from
tee to green there was still one thing
luck couldnt do for him

  he had to putt for himself

putting looks easy but just ask a
pro ask one of the men who spend
most of the year playing for prize money
you drive for fun hell tell you but
you putt for a living

  and these were perfect greens well
drained there was nothing to distract
dan kalik there they were slow be-
cause they were wet but they were all
the same there was never a new prob-
lem

  but dan kalik handled his putts that
day for after the first two holes he had
become vaguely aware that something
strange was going on that he had
become a part of some unique golf phe-
nomenon it gave him a sense of dis-
sociation from himself it let him play


the blue book magazine

in a state of some odd sort of emotional
suspension so that he could walk up to
a putt and look at it impersonally and
stroke it surely and delicately

  and the putts dropped

  the putts dropped and dan kalik
came to the last hole of his last round
and the sun came out the rain had
stopped and the wind had died and now
the sun found a crack in the clouds and
gleamed very bright and sparkling on the
wet grass

maybe you didnt see that whole
round maybe you stayed in the
clubhouse and kept dry but you saw
the last hole for the sun had come
out and word came that this unheard-
of kid with the funny name who had
been low in the morning now stood on
the eighteenth tee with the open in his
bag he had only to par the last hole to
win by two strokes

  the great jim forest was already in
and he was low nobody could touch
him but this kid named kalik who had
picked up eleven strokes on him today

  so you came out of the clubhouse with
the rest of them and swarmed down the
course to line the fairway on either side
you saw them coming from the tee
dan kalik and his partner their caddies
and the handful of spectators that had
followed them throughout the round
and you noticed dan kalik of course
you thought he looked very pale and
tired but you thought he looked con-
fident too

  you didnt notice the man with the
huge shoulders and arms you didnt
notice big john kalik who had fol-
lowed his son through the wind and rain
for thirty-five holes who hadnt even
dared speak to him for hours or stand
where dan could see him big john
kalik who now had a strange look in
his eyes and whose heart was in his
mouth

  you saw dan kalik come up to where
his tee-shot lay clean and sweet in the
middle of the fairway you saw him
take the three-iron from his caddy and
address the ball he looked tired all
right but he didnt look worried at all

  and he wasnt worried dan kalik
was riding the crest of a wave nothing
could worry him now the thing was in
the bag it looked almost absurdly easy
an iron to the green a couple of putts
if he didnt get on with the iron it didnt
matter he had a two-stroke margin it
was a cinch

  he didnt hurry he got the towel
from his caddy ard wiped the grip of
the three-iron and wiped his hands
carefully through the deluge of rain
that day the towel had been useless
you couldnt get a grip dry but he had
solved that he hed put a handkerchief
around the grip the wet cloth had
held firm against the leather and his
hands had held firm against the cloth
he didnt have to use it now

  he sightecthis shot calmly and picked
the place for the ball to roll onto the
green he didnt ihink about the shot
easy back then through clean with the
snap wrists arms shoulders hips
head feet and hands all doing their little
parts together and of their own accord

  the ball sailed straight and rolled onto
the green a touch too strong perhaps
for it trickled across the green and
dropped over the edge into a trap

  but dan kalik didnt care then he
almost chuckled for he wasnt worried
about getting out of the trap and then
two putts and he was down and he had
won he could do it with his eyes shut

  he walked along the fairway he
didnt notice you and all those others
standing along it he didnt notice you-as
you jammed arounc the green

  dan kalik looked down at his ball
and grinned a tiny grin it wasnt in
the sand it had come over the edge of
the trap so gently that it had hung on a
tuft of grass halfway down the steep
slope an easy shot very easy just
sitting there with lothing under it but
blades of grass waiting for the fiat sur-
face of the niblick to pitch gently onto
the green

he got the club from his caddy and
dried it and dried his hands and
then tested his grip carefully before he
stepped into the trap

  he settled his rig lit foot halfway down
the slope against a little hump of dirt
that clung around a tuft of grass he
brought his left foot over the bank and
rested it against the slope just enough to
balance him steadily all his weight was
on his right foot

  he waggled his club once making sure
of his grip being very careful to touch
nothing with the club he started to
bring it back for thg pitch-and the tuft
of grass under his right foot gave way
and he slid down the side of the trap a
foot or so

  then he didnt move for what seemed
like minutes he just stood there look-
three thousand or bust



ing down at the head of his club and
when he looked up his face which had
been pale was a dead white and his
voice when he spoke was tight and came
through thin lips

  i- he said aid then he swallowed
once i grounded my club he said

  the referee looking down at him
nodded sympathetically but gravely

  yes he said yes you grounded it
thats a two-stroke penalty

dan kalik nodded wordlessly and
looked down sgain it had been an
accident it had been plainly uninten-
tional but you cant ground your club
in a hazard if you do it costs you two
strokes and he had grounded it

  and now his ball which had been ly-
ing two was lying four and now dan
kalik who had had three strokes to get
down to win had two strokes to get down
to tie

  he set himself again very carefully
this time and then he shot it wasnt a
very good shot and it wasnt a very
bad one it came to a stop twelve feet
from the cup dan kalik climbed up
onto the green

	you saw him come up you held your
breath and watched and waited john
kalik saw him come up he saw him
come up to face that putt and john
kalik who was big and tough turned
paler than his son

  for john kalik had got the idea to-
day he had realized what you were up
against what his son was up against in
a fight if things get tough you can back
up against the ropes and come out swing-
ing youve got an opponent youve got
some one and something to fight

  but you havent in golf youre fight-
ing yourself its not that you have to
make yourself do something you have
to make yourself not do things you
have to make yourself not be tense and
keep your muscles from tying up you
have to be sure anc firm and delicate

  there it was a little ball lying out
there on the grass and a hole twelve
feet away and his kid with that awk-
ward-looking club they called a putter 
had to knock it in

  a chance at forty thousand dollars if
he did and nothing if he didnt

  john kalik looked at that ball and
began to shake all over

  it was so easy so very easy to miss
it was so delicate the gentlest touch
a blade of grass lhat grew the wrong
way could turn it aside

  john had been a fighter he had fin-
ished his last fight with two broken
hands and he had stabbed enough with
those hands in the last round to come
out with the decision there have been
many game fighters but none gamer
than john kalik and john kalik
realized now that if he had practised
this game for years he couldnt sink that
putt he didnt have the guts

  young dan kalik stood on the green
alone that was the thing he was so
alone out there all that weird con-
fidence that cant-do-wrong feeling was
gone out of him now he was out there
alone with a club and a ball and a cup
he saw you now and he saw the rest
of the gallery

  you stood there so quiet holding your
breath you and all the others you
were tense curious faces and hundreds of
staring eyes you hemmed him in it
was so quiet if only there were the rain
now or the wind if only some one
would scream or start a fight

  but it was still and quiet and no one
moved or spoke and there was the ball
and there was the cup he had to knock
the ball in with this clumsy thing in his
clumsy hands

for he was afraid now he was nerv-
ous now he couldnt get his breath
and his mind was full of hideous things
of how far it was to the cup-twelve feet
or a million miles he couldnt tell of
how small the cup was of how treach-
erous was the slope of the green now
of how much its speed might have
changed from previous greens through
drainage these last fifteen minutes of
those hundreds of staring eyes around
him and those hundreds of held breaths
that waited to come out all together in
a long sighing ah-h-h-h when he had
missed and of what it meant to his
father that he should not miss

  dan kalik stepped up to the ball he
laid his club behind it

  then he turned abruptly away and
dropped his club to the grass and said
to the referee in a queer toneless voice
its all right if i wait a minute

  the referee frowned he said well
-yes yes you can take what time you
need to line up the putt

  dan kalik turned back then and
dropped to one knee on the wet turf and
stared at his ball he stared at his
ball until he didnt see you and all those
eople standing with you close around
im he said to himself this is just


three thousand or bust

a putt you step up and tap them in
bobby jones said to be sure you were
breathing easy

  he breathed he counted while he
took twenty slow deep breaths and let
them slowly out-staring at the ball
until he didnt see it really until his eyes
looked glazed

  then dan kalik rose and picked up his
putter and walked to his ball as a man
walks in his sleep he set his feet with
no preliminaries he stroked the ball
and it rolled out and took the slope and
curved to drop into the middle of the
cup

  a long reverent sigh swelled out to
envelop him but he didnt know it
young dan kaliks knees had given
way and he was sitting in the middle of
the green

  his teeth began to chatter

jim forest beat dan kalik in the
play-off the next day he beat him by
five strokes which was about right
thats about how much better a golfer
jim forest was   

  dan kalik sat on a bench in front of
his locker he had been there several
minutes but he hadnt moved yet even to
untie a shoe he sat there looking down
at the floor and his shoulders sagged
wearily

  big john kalik sat beside him they
hadnt talked much the last two days
big john had wanted to talk to his kid
but he couldnt find the words he
tried now

  well he said awkwardly well son
you played a nice game a mighty nice
game

  after a second dan kalik said bitter-
ly if i hadnt slipped if id had
enough sense to get solid before i took a
club in my hands-

  big john found the words then

  danny he said forget it well
be okay if i go back to the mines it
aint going to kill me it doesnt matter
because you see i was a pretty game
guy in my day i had some guts but
danny the best day i ever lived if id
played golf all my life- he shook his
head a little and looked away and when
he finished his voice was very soft -i
wouldnt have had the guts to sink that
putt

  dan kalik didnt look up for a minute
he couldnt his old man was just try-
ing to cheer him up his old man was a
swell guy    then he looked up-and
saw his fathers eyes

dan kalik had finally had his
shower and was dressing when jim
forest came in

  it was mighty pretty kid forest
said i feel as if id stolen it tough
break that but thats golf now
about these exhibitions-i figure the best
thing is just to team up now and insist
that we play them together itll mean
more for both of us than if we leave it to
chance

  dan kalik ttlinkel at him exhi-
bitions he said he swallowed ex-
hibitions you mean- he couldnt
finish

  wake up forest hit him on the
shoulder youre news kid you got
color theyll cry for you you wont
get what i do but ycull get nice dough
a hundred or a hundred fifty a crack
dan kalik got his breath a hun-
dred   he said listen-i mean-look
would it be-could i get any of it
quick 

  forest chuckled  well he said by
tomorrow noon we ought to have enough
guarantees for you to borrow a thousand
on therell be mors when we get our
route laid out between five and ten
grand for you all together id say
theyll go for you kid youll see

it was about twenty minutes later that
john kalik said son when this is
over whatll you do if you want to
come in with us-well you got an inter-
est waiting for you you know itll be a
damn solid company then too

  dan kalik was silent a second then
he said hesitantly -i-well you see
if this is like fores says itll be ill
have enough publicity so i ought to be
able to get a pretty good pros job ive
had the three years apprenticeship im
eligible for the pg a and-id like
that i guess id like that pretty well
yeah i guess so john kalik said
slowly he paused a moment looking a
bit sheepish but he went on

  well he said well i guess i aint
been gettin as much exercise as i really
ought to if you think maybe i could
learn to play the game half decent-not
like you of course bat just pretty good
-why let me know when you get set-
tled ill be around for some lessons
when this road job is done

  big john kalik never used to talk
about his son now he plays golf four
days a week and talks about him all the
time    and now you know about the
national open that year

drums across the sea

the stirrini tale of the metamorphosis of damon pythias green

by charles layng

it is difficult foi us old grads to con-
ceive of the wendover drum without
damon pythian green the wend-
over drum still reposes in the sanctum
reserved for it under the stadium but
damon pythias green after years of
staying put has removed himself far far
from the peaceful scholastic atmosphere
that graces barwood alabama for
years the wendover drum-the biggest
drum of any college in the south al-
though state normal grads may vainly
dispute the claim-was never seen except
in the company of damon pythias green
now alas that association has been brok-
en up a happening as unthinkable as
unnatural as the reparation of ham and
eggs or of scotch and soda

  as the person responsible for the as-
sociation in the first place and as the
only wendover grad who until now has



known what happened to damon pythias
green it seems to devolve upon me to
reveal the amazing facts in the case

  modestly i admit to a certain innate
talent and no small amount of skill with
the drumsticks either musical or culi-
nary after all why shouldnt i admit it
since its a hereditary trait for wasnt a
first cousin of my father the drumming-
est drummer-boy and the chicken-eat-
ingest youngster for his size in the whole
confederate army he was there-
fore it is not at all surprising that my
abilities along those lines should have
been recognized and that as early as my
freshman year at wendover i had al-
ready attained the honor of being bass-
drummer in the wendover band it was
then that i met damon pythias green

  wandering alone one night on the de-
serted football field the better to dream


the blue book magazine

dreams of the young lady who was cur-
rently wearing my frat pin i heard the
roll of the drum issuing from the dark-
ened depths under the stadium even
in my somewhat bemused state my mu-
sicians soul told me that the drum-
sticks were in the hands of a master
such rhythm such volume and such tone
are not attained by one drummer in ten
million

  hastily and more than a little rev-
erently as that masterly thrumming
thrilled me to that very cockle of my
heart reserved for love of drumming i
rushed to the room where the instru-
ments were kept as i entered i could
see the ghostly outlines of the drum in
the stray wisps of moonlight that wafted
in the window but of the drummer noth-
ing was visible-the drum seemed to be
beating itself

  i must admit that my first thought was
to leave the room the stadium and for
that matter the campus as quickly as
possible but then i hesitated after all
was not my fathers second cousin the
hero of shiloh he was therefore i
stayed where i was for a moment to
gather courage and then moved in closer
the drummer became visible or at least
as visible as a small inky-black colored
boy ever is of a darkish night that was
my first sight of damon pythias green

with his small body hunched over
in concentration and only the whites
of his eyes showing in his ecstasy he was
pounding that drum as it had never been
pounded before even by me so intent
was he that even when i spoke to him
he didnt look up and it was not until
he had finished-and superbly too-a
long and difficult roll that he noticed my
presence then with a yell he started
for the door as fast as his short legs
could carry him it was all i could do
to catch him grab him by the scruff of
the neck and hang on

  where did you learn to drum i
asked when for a moment he had stopped
squirming

  on dishpans in mammys kitchen
suh

  he looked up at me with his eyes roll-
ing in fright and then he flashed a grin
of recognition

  scuse me suh haint yo de bass drum-
mer in de band

  i nodded and an eager look crossed
his face

  nen mebbe yo cd fix it sos i could
play on at drum nights sometimes when

nobody else wants to ahd do anythin
fo you suh efn yo could

  thats how the association between
damon pythias green and the wend-
over drum began for in deference to a
fellow-artist i could do nothing less than
to have him appointed custodian of the
band instruments and puller of the cart
on which the bass drum rested during the
bands parades

it proved art excellent arrangement
for damon pythias got to play on his
beloved drum and i got a most indus-
trious valet damon pythias in addi-
tion became quite a campus celebrity
with the aid of professor cyneas f pin-
feather phd head of the psychology
departmental wendover as it happened
professor pinfeather had just returned
from spending his sabbatical year abroad
at the exact time when the first of the
faint freudian stirrings that were to
make america complex-conscious began
and damon pythias smilingly and will-
ingly agreed to serve as exhibit a in the
professors psychology courses for
hours he would doze in a chair next to
the professors desk

  this young person the eminent doc-
tor was wont to interne is the perfect
example of the inferiority complex and
one of its by-products the size fixation
although he is approximately eighteen
years of age you will note that he is
much smaller than is usual for that age
and-

  i shall not attempt to quote the pro-
fessor literally largely because i could
not if i would in view of a fortunate fa-
cility of mine of being able to sleep with-
out exterior signs that anyone as wrapped
up in his subject as the professor was
could distinguish however through
sheer repetition it did eventually soak
in upon me that damon pythias accord-
ing to messrs pinfeather and freud in
the order named was doomed to worship
objects of large size hence his love of
the bass drum moreover according to
the professor he would at the proper
time marry a womar much bigger than
himself and be henpecked ever after

  or perhaps the professor would
conclude and i remember his exact
words as they marked the welcome end
of the hour and always awoke me there
will be a rebellion aid the subject will
endeavor to prove his superiority when
this occurs a complete and basic meta-
morphosis will in all likelihood take
place
drums across the sea



   and dr pinfeather phd thereupon
 achieved a certain fame even among his
 students when damon pythias-possi-
 bly under the influence of the power of
 suggestion-did exactly as the professor
 had predicted from among the not un-
 limited choice of large black girls in
 barwood he selected he largest and
 the blackest in the ample person of ren-
 dezvous applegate and duly led her to
 the altar or vice versa

   perfessor sho hit de nail on de haid
 about men rendezvous damon py-
 thias explained to me

   but why did you marry her
 damon grinned his ample white-
 toothed grin

  ahdunno but what he mean about
 dis rebellion he continued thought
 at was ovah long ago when we-uns got
 us freed

   i tried to explain to damon pythias
 that between persons a rebellion meant
 something quite different and that what

 	he referred to hadnt been a rebellion
  anyway but a war between the states
 im afraid however thst i made rather
 heavy weather of it the ugh damon py-
 thias was a bright enough lad to him
 the long words of professor pinfeather
 were quite sufficiently impressive to be
 taken as a form of conjuh and there
 wasnt a colored boy in all of barwood
 who didnt know the uselessness of fight-
 ing that

 that the professor was right too in
 his prediction that damon pythias
 would be henpecked was soon apparent
 rendezvous had a mind of her own with
 a tongue to match and a temperament
 and physique ideally adapted to the con-
 genial task of henpecking a scrawny un-
 dersized negro although it is doubtful
 if she ever heard of the professors
 prophecy she fulfilled it to the letter
 none the less for a long time damon
 pythias said nothing abc ut itjut i could
 tell from his touch on he drums times
 back of the stadium when he thought no
 one was within earshot that his heart was
 sad and crying out for independence

   in due course and without honors i
 was graduated but damon pythias
 stuck to me like a burr pressing my
 clothes and shining my shoes and trying
 vainly to get me to ksep up with my
 drumming but i was oo busy with my
 current frat-pin wearer and my new
 duties as reporter for the barwood ban-
 ner to pursue my art and i never have
 taken it up again not you will under-

 stand but that given the drumsticks
 even today i couldnt turn in a masterly
 performance but you know how such
 things are they drift

  damon pythias on the contrary went
on taking care of his drums his drum-
ming and his rendezvous uncomplain-
ing and sometimes even cheerful under
the spell of his own drumming it was
not until some years later as i was
about to depart for the metropolitan
field that i ever heard him protest just
a few days before i left he appeared at
my establishment wearing what in any-
one some shades lighter would have
been a very black eye he rubbed it
with tender fingers

   at rebellion perfessor alius talks
about hit aint fur away now suh he
told me but i only laughed at him for
to me rendezvous and damon pythias
seemed as firmly united as were damon
pythias and the wendover drum

as it happened i was wrong on both
 counts but it took years to bring it
about on my less and less frequent
visits to barwood damon pythias would
mutter ever more and ever darker
threats but it was only recently that i
returned to barwood to find him gone
at last

  rendezvous told me all about it when
she came to inquire if i knew anything
of his whereabouts

   at damon pythias he were a deep
one she informed me fr ten yeahs
he de best husband a ooman evah had
and nen what he do nigh to muhdeh
me at what he do one night i tol
him not to make so much noise wiv a
ol drum fm de band he had round de
house he din say nuthin jes haul
off and sock me alongside de haid wiv
a drumstick he do when i come to he
gone dat wuthless damon pythias
haint seen hide nr haih o him sence
think he come back

  i consoled the gigantic rendezvous as
best i could and then proceeded to for-
get all about damon pythias and his
problems for i received a telegram that
sent me scurrying back to new york
my big chance had come the paper
wanted to send me to ethiopia as war
correspondent would i go would i
wasnt my fathers third cousin one of
the best war correspondents the birming-
ham herald ever had he was so i
went

  adventures awaited me in plenty but

find a masterly account in the daily
bugle or any of the papers subscribing
to its syndicated foreign service the
fact remains that i alone of all the for-
eign correspondents penetrated into the
far and mountainous north of ethiopia
-into the territory of the hyena men
it was in the company of a hyena chief-
tain and his followers that i penetrated
into the unknown geez country climb-
ing high mountains skirting dizzy gorges
and generally disporting myself as de-
scribed in articles iv and v of my series
and chapter  of my forthcoming book

  what will not be in the book however
is my astonishing renewal of acquaint-
ance with an old friend

my safari had arduously penetrated
far beyond the spots that are marked
on the map when one evening as i was
huddled over a campfire the rolling of
a drum came to my ears i leaped to
my feet in utter astonishment for there
was something about that beat that was
unmistakable there was there could
be only one person in the world who had
that peculiar insistent insidious rhythm
at his finger-tips and that person was
damon pythias green in another mo-
ment i was certain for the distant
drummer launched into the bass-drum

arrangement of  old wendover to thee
something i could never forget

  but if the rolling of the drums across
miles of high plateau had a startling
effect upon me it had a positively elec- 
trical effect on the natives who accom-
panied me with one accord they pros-
trated themselves rapidly five times to
the accompaniment of a wailing chant
then although ihey were tired from the
days march they leaped to their feet
and began shouldering their burdens
under the spell of the roaring of that
distant drum which was now doing thy
storied ivied walls they worked faster
than i had ever seen them work in a
sort of feverish ranee

  i sought out he chief to protest but
he merely shook his head and pointed in
the direction whence that magnetic
booming came by this time i had ac-
quired a fairish familiarity with the
language and alter several repetitions i
caught the chiefs meaning

  we must go on now tonight the
chief said for that is the voice of the
great ngbani calling us-calling calling
calling  

  i stared at him in amazement

  nonsense the men are tired and
so am i well stay right here until
morning
drums across the sea



  no the white chief is powerful
true but when ngbani calls we come

  and who is ngbani

 something more than man some-
thing- listen he calls us to assemble
perchance the italians are coming per-
chance-but no matter ngbani calls
and we obey

what ngbani was actually calling
at that moment was beat south-
western wesleyan tech but my protests
went for naught there and then tired as
we were the safari set out drawn irre-
sistibly toward the vortex of that whirl-
pool of sound that filled the air with a
throbbing beat dancingly the hyena
men carried their heavy burdens uphill
and down at a swift trot to the beat of
plunge those forty yards and it was
quite all that i could do even though
unburdened and buoyed up by that im-
mortal wendover song as i was to keep
up with them

  all through the night our ears pulsed
to the siren call of that beat now steady
now quavering but always insidious
and never more so than when it took
up the sweetheart o tau epsilon nu
loader and ever louder it grew as we
approadied it until at last mid a burst
of the orange blue and heliotrope
we debouched from a sparse forest and
into a huge clearing other groups were
already there and still others were ap-
proaching from all directions each na-
tive from the mightiest chiefs down
prostrating himself ir a-sort of frenzied
reverence as soon as he reached the
clearing

  in the center stood the biggest drum
ive ever seen and beating it with the
sure deft hand of a master was a small
wizened negro in whom-despite his out-
landish costume of lions mane and leop-
ards skin and necklaces of vicious-look-
ing teeth from palpably defunct animals
-i recognized damon pythias green
he was as intent as ever over his drum-
ming lput he no lor ger hunched while
playing his head was high and his
chest thrust out and he was drinking in
the adulation offered him from all sides
i approached him

  hello damon pyihias i shouted in-
to his ear above the roar of wendovers
victory

  he dropped the drumsticks as though
he had been shot and whirled around
with tears of welcome in his eyes

 how come but nevah mind suh
the mainest an impohtantest thing is

yo is heah an cn see whats happened
to lil ol damon pythias green see all
those niggahs they thinks ahm a
gawd-an me a lil runt fm barwood

  but how did this happen

  well suh at rebellion at perfessor

me suddent-like an ah let at big ren-
dezvous have it right behin de eah an

buti an ah lef theah and wandehed
up heah about six months ago an didnt
i find me a drum dey claims nobody
cn beat it but de great ngbani so ah
is it looky

  he turned to the drum and drew from
it a few sobbing sounds that i recognized
as cutting english iii and from a
thousand throats the worshiping cry of
ngbani rose

  it seems that the metamorphosis pre-
dicted by professor pinfeather is a
jait accompli i told him

 huh

  youve changed

  yas suh fm de bottom up fm de
inside out fm de outside in ahm big
stuff now nobody cn tell me what to
do ahm a gawd an-

a shrill and angry scream caused
him to leave the sentence suspended
in midair

  from an adjacent hut there emerged
the largest negress ive ever seen six
feet and a half tall if she was an inch
and of the general breadth of a barn
door

   ats mah new wife damon pythias
explained

  in the voice of a petulant foghorn-
an unusually loud foghorn-the giantess
shouted something at damon pythias
and he replied

  as i have said my knowledge of the
amharic tongue is only rudimentary
but it sufficed for this interchange which
might be translated as follows

  hey yo wuthless scoundrel what yo
been doin out theah all night wiv at
trash yo cm right in heah this min-
ute or ahll knock yo eahs down

the story thus far

the extraordinary events here set
forth had their beginnings a gen-
eration ago when dr lincoln rand
set sail aboard the schooner cherokee on
a great-hearted errand as medical mis-
sionary to the primitive people of the
northwest coast with him went his
young wife helena and his indian friend
mokuyi

blown far out of her course by north
pacific gales through the bering sea and
into the unknown arctic north of siberia
the cherokee was wrecked upon a wild
and reef-girt coast-the shore it proved
of the great hitherto unknown land of
natowa a region warmed by uncharted
ocean currents and by great volcanic fis-
sures and hot springs a land thickly
wooded with evergreens of the sequoia
family and supporting many and varied
wild animals stranger still was its hu-
man population a people so like the

 american indians in appearance in
 language in life and beliefs and customs
 that dr rand soon came to the con-
 clusion that here was the original birth-
 place of the indian race

   not long after tie arrival of the cast-
 aways the son of lincoln rand and
 helena was born but only a few weeks
 later the childs parents were both killed
 in a raid by hostile natives upon the
 shoni tribe who had given them shelter
 thereupon the clild was adopted by
 mokuyi and cared for by his native wife
 awena

   in this primitive life kioga or the
 snow hawk as he was named grew to a
 splendid manhood from mokuyi and
 from books salvaged from another ship
 wrecked upon the coast he learned to
 speak and write english and from his
 wild comrades he acquired a wealth of
 forest lore when mokuyi was murdered

wilderness

by a shoni secret society kioga avenged
his death implacably and his prowess
in war and hunting at length made him
war-chief tain of the tribe when how-
ever another party of white people were
wrecked upon the reefs of natowa fool-
ishly fired upon the natives and were
about to be put to death kioga rescued
them and for that lie was exiled from
his adopted people

  yearning to see t be country of his
fathers kioga aided this castaway yacht-
ing party-beth la salle her brother
dan and her suitor allan kendle-to
build a boat and escape on the south-
ward journey kendle grew suspicious of
beths growing interest in kioga and
contrived to have him left marooned on
the ice when a whaler picked up the rest
of the party

  the snow hawk survived all dangers
however and made his way to san fran-

cisco and thence to new york but
civilization proved too much for kioga
disgusted by its many hypocrisies and
believing his love rejected by beth he
left new york and set out overland
through canada and alaska to make his
way back to natowa and on the way
he gathered a group of american indians
-people homesick for the free and
simple life that was theirs before the
white man came-to take back with him
to the land of their forefathers

  meanwhile beth la salle her brother
dan and their friend the scientist dr
munro chartered the schooner nanvhal
and set forth from san francisco to
overtake him the story continues in
detail

at juneau the narwhal interrupted her
i northward voyage for a few addition-
al supplies-and to hire a new cook for


	the blue book magazine

henders the man they had shipped at
san francisco had shown himself too
fond of liquor to warrant risking him on
their long and hazardous voyage the
search was delegated to dan la salle

  it was the noon-hour when he landed
and not far from the schooner he came
upon a crowd of dockhands and steve-
dores gesticulating angrily before a wall
of high-piled merchandise wrathful
epithets crackled on the salty breeze
approaching the scene of hostility dan
peered between the heads of the agitated
dock-gang

  a stranger figure never trod the water-
front than he upon whom dans curious
gaze alighted not over five feet four
the stranger stood dwarfed in the circle
of his persecutors brown as coffee was
the homely face below the brim of a
dusty soft hat from under the wavy
brim a most peculiar pair of eyes looked
calmly forth upon the world and found
something therein to twinkle at like
most else about the man the eyes did
not quite match and one bushy brow
was but half the size of its neighbor a
scar marking the spot where once its
remainder had flourished the nose was
remarkable for its size and straightness
above sweeping lank mustaches for the
rest from skinny wrinkled turkey-neck
down he was a most unkempt disrepu-
table specimen of mankind

  all of this dans eyes absorbed in a
swift glance as he sought the source of
a high-pitched chatter that rose defiant-
ly above the barrage of profanity sud-
denly a long prehensile coil flicked its
length about the little mans neck a
black spidery hairy hand appeared from
behind one ear to seize his shirt-collar
its mate flourishing a fistful of good
american currency proceeded to stuff
the greenbacks into the strangers breast
pocket whereafter the diminutive
monkey continued spouting fury and
indignation from safety behind its non-
descript master at a word from be-
neath the mustaches the little animal
became abruptly silent without formal-
ity the stranger then introduced himself
to all who cared to listen

  shore as my names flashpan us-all
better be a-movin on

  the voice like his person was un-
usual coming cracked and alternately
strong and whispered

   taint nowise healthy hereabouts for
us or for others he added meaningly
producing a long-barreled pistol of an-
cient vintage and cocking it audibly

with an agile thumb naow gentmen
he continued clar the road then
to the monkey on his shoulder bhold
the ways of men placer and be thankful
the good lord made ye a monkey the
heathens like to cleaned us out with
marked cyards yet when we turn the
tables and git it tack they cuss and
whats worse they repent not

  at this point one of the angry dock-
hands would have laid hands upon the
little man from one side but a black dog
of northern breed leaped up and clicked
menacing white fargs an inch from his
throat an instant later the entire mob
closely pursued by this grim cerberus
took to its heels leaving the diminutive
stranger in command of the field
kioga of the wilderness



  he who called himself flashpan eyed
them quizzically a moment spat with
incredible exactitude ten feet across the
dock into the bay and ihrust his weapon
back into his rope belt through his
fingers he sent forth a shrill whistle
back came the great dog with wagging
tail bending flashpan swung an im-
mense packsack hung with pick and
shovel and cooking-oulfit to his back
upon which the monkey sprang instantly

thus like a scrawny atlas bearing
the earth upon his shoulders flash-
pan prepared to continue his journeyings
anew when his bright all-noticing eye
chanced to glimpse the narwhal tugging
at her dripping lines checking he
lowered his immense burden and its
agitated occupant to gaze yearningly
upon the stout craft

  handsome isnt she said dan by
way-of scraping acquaintance a beau-
ty son replied the ancient i mind
me son of times ive sailed aroun the
globe on such a ship an-

  ever cooked  interrupted his young
listener

  aye cooked answered the ancient
mariner looking surprised sharks fins
in the chiny sea an birds nests on the
yangtsuey curry-rice in injy and spa-
ghetti in itly sourdough biscuit on
the yukon an-

                     whal or ill carve ye
                     into christmas beef

  how much longer this recital would
have continued history knoweth not for
at this point dan interrupted

  look here we need a cook on the
narwhal

  with shrewd eyes the little man looked
from dan to ship and back gulped and
with an effort that swelled veins on neck
and forehead managed no ye do
suppose you come aboard and have
a talk with the captain

  wa-al began flashpan a doubtful
eye roving from his dog to his monkey
ymean all three of us i spose

  dan grinned why not

  flashpan recalled his dog from eager
investigations about a rat-hole in the
pier this here is nugget he explained
to dan call him that account he was
a lucky find and gold clear through
now this monk here his names placer
account hes uncertain kind of an un-
known claim an ynever know what

p or our records said dr munro
 when dan had presented his find
i must ask you a few questions

  flashpan doffed his hat with a sweep
at yer service capn

  how old are you flashpan  munro
began

  the new cook squinted with concen-
tration and spat reflectively through an
open porthole roundbout  twas
when i come of votin age and sold my
first ballot he recalled

  pretty old for this job said munro
thoughtfully

  old but tough returned flashpan
with a look of secret alarm

  but this may be a dangerous voyage
dead shot with rifle and pistol re-
turned flashpan swiftly

 we-el-

  cook like a frenchman i can per-
sisted flashpan been around i hev

roundly confidently i accept the berth

  hold on  laughed munro whats

flashpan beat time with a hobnailed boot while in his hoarse

up a twelve-ounce nugget other day up
dawson way kept it fer a souvenir-
fust one in nigh onto twenty year
chicken-feed he pronounced disdain-
fully then with hope strike it rich
some day mebbe

  what about the monkey

  placer oh hell stand the cold
why he got away from a circus down
iowy-way in a snowstorm-had fur like
a seal when i caught him

  all right decided munro i think
youre the man for us now as to pay-
with a gesture of superb disdain flash-
pan waived the trifling matter never
earnt a dollar in me life capn he de-
clared been diggin fer gold nigh onto
forty year an t got enough here-he
slapped a clinking bag at his waist-
and in other places he added mys-
teriously to live comfortble but its
the lookin i like sir not the findin
he confided never mind the pay sir
jest lemme go ashore wherever we be
and try me luck is all i ask sir

late that night henders crossed the
j gangplank unsteadily and went down
the forward hatch at the galley door
he paused to rub clouded eyes and look
again upon a table dressed with lov-
ing care in miniature pirates clothes
swaggered a long-tailed monkey in shiny
boots he doffed his tiny black hat

then cursed the intruder roundly by
the stove eyes gleaming sat a huge
bristling dog a moment henders stood
lost in liquorous amazement then ven-
tured to enter his galley on the instant
its guardian bared his teeth and warned
the man back with a growl

  my own galley hiccuped the cook
wonderingly an  wont let me in eh 
he drew back his booted foot to kick

  hull on thar came a commanding
voice from behind turning henders
found a pair of qu zzical eyes regarding
him from the pantry and saw a strange
figure wearing a cooks apron in the
figures hand was a meat-cleaver
whore you he demanded thickly
i be flashpan cook on this wessel
whatre you-all doin in my galley
your galley repeated henders
slowly he dropped a hand to the cabin-
house top where he had seen a belaying-
pin-a weapon his fingers fumbled for
it with a curse he realized it had dis-
appeared almost under his eyes-and
glancing up he saw an active simian flee-
ing aloft bearing away the belaying-pin

  from aft came the laughter of the
crew the ex-cook in fury brandished
a ham-like hand at the vanishing thief
and cursed flashpan obscenely demand-
ing dyknow who i am

  imperturbably the new cook leaned
back then with a sudden show of
kioga of the wilderness



voice he improvised words swing ho were a-sailin for treasure

ferocity jumped forward flourishing his
cleaver startled henders retreated to
thfe gangplank teeter ng as he sought to
balance himself then he slipped-from
the arms of bacchus into those of
oceanus the chill sobering waters
closed gently above his head

  when he rose into view i know ye
now cried flashpan wipe the sea-
weed from yer ear an when yeve
cooled off a bit neptune yell find yer
truck on yonder dock and come no
more aboard the narwhal or ill carve
ye into christmas be if

  so by cunning and force wisely ex-
pended flashpan came into despotic
domination of the narwhals galley it
was soon apparent that this was all for
the best upon their hooks the once
dirty pans hung glistening like mirrors
fresh paint covered the king-neglected
shelves from which newly washed cups
swung to the ships movement

  dan passing the galley fell back in
amazement

  from his pack and from an oldleather
trunk which flashpan had brought
aboard a multiplicity of objects had
emerged to decorate that culinary strong-
hold a brace of pistols hung above the
stove flanked by a bowie-knife in a long
sheath and an old sharps rifle with
ornately carved stock on a nail several
bullet-molds hung by strings a pair

of spurs jingled above the door sur-
mounted by a horseshoe

  however bizarre his ideas of decora-
tion flashpan proved his cooks skill
at the first meal biscuits brown and
feather-light appeared in magic quantity
from his oven roast fowl cooked to a
turn steamed upon the great oaken
cabin table and the cheering aroma of
coffee brewed with masterly touch arose

  after dinner in a hoarse but not un-
pleasant voice flashpan demonstrated
another side of his character accom-
panying himself upon a battered guitar
produced magically from tljat all-encom-
passing trunk he sang

  oh-h  been cook on a four-wheeled
    schooner

  a cook on the lone prairie-e-e

  ive cooked and ive fried an dang near
    died

  in many a far countre-e-e

  but whod have knowed that afore it
    snowed

  id be cook on a schooner at sea

some hours later on the rise of the
tide the norwhal moved from her
wharf and soon rode the first long swell
of the high seas thus in a vessel hardly
larger than that in which a genoese dis-
covered a new world four centuries and
more earlier munro set sail into the
white sanctity of the arctic whose grim

 across the graves of
 those who had died
 that food might go
 farther appeared the
 vanguard of the cari-
 bou-herds

 gods have guarded its secrets from the
 beginnings of recorded time

   with a last salute to land from her
 air-whistle and a blast on her patent
 fog-horn the narwhal went forth at sun-
 down upon her odyssey her red and
 green side-lights burned brightly her
 iron prow clove the waters with a gentle
 hiss her new rope creaked and her
 sails bellied out full of the wind that
 snapped the flag being lowered from her
 truck

  aft at the wheel dr james munro
 leaned upon its spokes a different and
 younger-looking man than he had been
 ashore from somewhere he had pro-
 duced a fringed buckskin coat ornament-
 ed with colored quillwork gift of some
 far-away indian friend he made a fine
 picturesque figure garbed thus

   on the rail near the forward cabin-
 house beth la salle gazed into the
 mysterious distance recollection strong
 within her an immense full moon hung
 as if suspended from the crosstrees like
 some great brass gong waiting to be
 struck under such a moon she had
 last seen the man she loved going out
 into the arctic night   

   a little later when dan came on deck
 and would have spoken beth raised a
 hand for silence from the bow came
 the strains of a guitar in the shadow of
 the fore-sail with his pets worshipfully
 mute at shoulder and knee sat flashpan
 beating time with a hobnailed boot while
 in his hoarse voice he improvised words
 to a nameless but swinging melody

   swing ho swing ho were a-sailin
    for treasure

the hu nger camp

 night and day kioga drove his men
 now for a visible skin of ice cov-
 ered the river but at last the thickening
 ice cut through one of the craft that
 marked the end of river travel na-
 ture hitherto neulral was now leagued
 against them

   with deep regret kioga saw his canoes
 drawn uponmhe bank and hidden in the
 brush for all thi toil of the portages
 the going had been swift where the rivers
 were deep henceforward it would be
 even more toilsome as they continued
 the northward march on foot when
 the march was resumed none was with-
 out a share of the vital load the order
 of indian march was maintained as be-
 fore save that now the dogs drew the
 travois thus for a week with ice in
 the rivers and the now not deep enough
 for sledge travel they moved very slowly
 -and at a time wiaen haste was vital

   but the time was not wasted about
 the camp-fires there was great activity
 of branches steamed to shape and strips
 of moose-hide they made long snow-
 shoes of driftwood found near the
 river they made sledge-runners and
 while tokala watched with fascinated
 eyes the snow fiawk plaited several
 strips of moose-hide into a tapered lash
 some fifteen feet long in the firelight
 the resulting whip was a beautiful russet
 brown and it coiled from kiogas hand
 like some sinuous snake

   during ihat night it snowed heavily
 and in the morning the dogs were har-
 nessed upon the sledges were laid the
 belongings of the band lashed securely
 against the inevitable upsets upon
 their feet the indians fixed the ready-
 made snowshoes

   then with a shout and resounding
 crack of kiogas whip they were off
 the dog-teams first hitched in tandem
 for easy passage through the woods along
 the river before the dogs went two

i
kioga of the wilderness



strong young men on snowshoes taking
their turn at breaking trail behind the
sledges came the remainder of the band
scattered along well-provided though
they now were in equipment they must
be alert to kill meat the dogs would
eat in two weeks all they could haul and
their back-loads or dried meat were
necessarily light

for tokala this journey was pure ec-
stasy into his healing lungs he drank
the clean free air of the open hills be-
hind him he had already put all thought
of the poverty and deadly labor which
had scarred his short life by night no
more the close quarlers of airless dormi-
tory but above his head the illimitable
vault of heaven hung with the blazing
northern stars and in the north sky
at night the unspeakable beauty of the
aurora warm green pale yellow sheer-
est silver moved from east to west like
a host of invisible warriors bearing a
forest of flashing spears

  each evening the women put out cun-
ning snares and caught many small fur-
bearers white foxesi hares a few mink
and weasels late cne afternoon poised
upon a ridge fifty yards away a golden-
eyed lynx gray-waite and beautiful
watched them pass from kiogas ready
bow leaped a slim swift shaft which
struck the snarling cat through eye and
brain of the lynx meat they ate at the
sunset meal and found it very good the
richly marked skin was added to that of
some white foxes and a fine outfit made
for tokala

  the sick boy was showing improve-
ment the puny frame had straightened
a delicate color came and went now in
the once pallid face his endurance had
also grown and whenever duty per-
mitted he ran beside the mighty snow-
hawk and into tlose eager little ears
kioga told many a tale of his own excit-
ing boyhood

  tales of a lithe brown-skinned boy
hotly pursued over hill and dale by the
gaunt wolves of ga-hu-ti forty in a
pack of hairbreadth escapes from tigers
claw and snow-leopards fang of strange
adventure on the foaming rivers of mys-
terious natowa in the thunder of her
mighty cataracts tales that are told
about the lodge-fircs of those distant
indian tribesmen ol coastal natowa

  he told tokala of how mokuyi had
given him a bear-cub aki and of how
aki had led him among the bears with
whom he spent years of his early life

returning to the village possessed of a
woodcraft surpassing the cunning of the
subtlest hunter he told of how yanu
the fierce old she-bear had spilled her
life-blood defending him against his wild
enemies of aki faithful guardian of his
childhood upon whose shaggy belly oft
his head was pillowed of mika the sil-
ver-coated a white-toothed puma raised
from cubhood with whom he had hunted
in concert so that no beast in all the
wilderness was safe from their onset
and of many another fierce pet that
shared his friendship in those days

  and at sunset of the day he had
killed the lynx he tossed a surprise into
tokalas lap a half-grown lynx kitten
one of a litter he had discovered hidden
away somewhere indeed life had be-
come very good for tokala the fox

   each day now the party drew closer
to its first objective the arctic ocean
and tokala-who could know little of
the terrific difficulties and dangers of the
journey over ice and stormy waters yet
before them-dreamed eagerly of this
promised land of natowa which kioga
so vividly described   

  and now gaunt famine dogged their
trail for the game which had sustained
them disappeared only whitefish caught
on the bone hooks through a hole in the
ice sustained them came a day when
even this source of supply failed

   they ate bark and tender twigs from
the rocks they took an occasional bit of
tripe de roche the wild plant which has
sustained many a starving party in the
north a dwarf variety of labrador tea
was found also from which they brewed
a spirit-lifting draft but it was not
enough

great age combined with near-star-
vation struck down old bull-calf in
his ninety-third year sits-in-sun found
him dead wrapped in his blanket facing
the southeast just as the sun rose her
cracked and quavering voice rose in the
 mourning-cry all day the aged crone
wept bewailing her dead nor at night-
fall would she be comforted

  three-score and ten summers have i
been his sits-beside-him woman he loved
to dress my hair all those early years i
rode at his side bearing his shield to-
gether we lived the old life and saw the
buffalo pass we shared the poverty
given us by white men we learned of
natowa land of the indian but-ai-i-i
too late bull-calf has gone away i
will walk no more but sit beside him as

 before so that if a time comes that he
 wakes he will find me there

  mother protested kioga we do not
wish you to die

  my son she answered solemnly i
am sits-in-sun i have spoken

  the snow hawk said no more but
aided by several of the band he erected
a tall scaffold of new-cut limbs upon
this after singing and eulogizing they
laid the remains of bull-calf swathed in
blanket and with face painted beside
him they placed his pipe his knife the
quiver and bow with which he had
hunted in his youth and upon his burial
scaffold they hung his cherished shield

  unnoticed by old sit-n-sun kioga
laid a bone needle a skinnin -knife and
a few personal things a he- sde along
with a piece of dried meat these were
to accompany her on a journey longer
than this march had been for he knew
she would never rise again

  the band then quietly withdrew leav-
ing sits-in-sun chanting the old death-
songs of her tribe as they turned a bend
in the river and looked back she still
knelt immobile a fold of the dead
chiefs blanket flapped in the sad wind
sits-in-sun did not move the shield
swung gently flashing in the sunlight

  the following days diminished the
weakening party by several of its num-
ber crow man sixty-nine passed to his
ancestors and three scalps who could
not bear to see him go alone followed a
little later she-ts-swift gave up the
ghost one night at dusk   

  faced with the task of providing meat
for all these famished mouths in a land
named for its scarcity kiogas eye often
fell upon the dogs but if he slew them
he knew they must leave behind much
that was valuable so long as strength
held out he determined to avoid loss of
a single dog

one night camp was pitched in a copse
of dwarfed trees scooping away
the snow with snowshoes the men cleared
a circle and helped the women raise a
wigwam of branches chinked with snow

  speech came seldom and gloomily
then those who could sat erect warm-
ing themselves at their tiny fire-a
precious core of heat since it constituted
all they had been able to find of dry
wood the barren ground is well
named

  they looked at one another at the dis-
cernible sag of the cheeks the emacia-
tion which drew the transparent skin

tight from cheek-bone to cheek-bone
their skulls seemed barely covered their
hair hung down like black snakes and
they appeared so wild and terrible that
they no longer looked at one another

  the dogs as if possessed of second
sight evaded the men huddled together
outside the tent in a hollow and moved
waith-iike about howling fixing the
camp with their gleaming eyes they
too were waiting the end they too were
hungry

  then to kioga came wounded knee
who gazed long into the fire ere speak-
ing in these words

  my eyes are dim kioga but i see
straight and this is what i see we
old folk hold you back kioga made as
if to interrupt but the old man checked
him with hand upheld hear me my
son we have talked we old ones we
have counseled together and this we
say leave us behind go on alone
else our children will never see this land
of natowa we wish our children to
live that they may reach this land of
happy hunting

now hawk thought a time in
silence before answering

  elder brothers hear my words we
younger ones have good ears but we
cannot hear what you have just said we
hunger but we are men-and men of
our people know how to starve if we
find no meat tomorrow we will find it
the next day i say again we have good
ears but we cannot hear the words you
have just spoken

  kioga turned to the younger men as
if to seek confirmation of those for whom
he spoke a deep haul haul an-
swered him

  wounded knee said no more but re-
turned to the circle of councilors who
numbered four the last of the very old
people

  a little later kioga drew his blanket
about his eyes to sesk an hours sleep
with a start he awoke and it seemed
that he had slept but a moment he
glanced over toward where the old coun-
cilors had sat then came erect he saw
they were not lying with feet to the blaze
as customarily

  the four chiefs were missing rising
he went to the entrance of the lodge
which flapped and pushed aside the skin
white glittering granules of snow sifted
in and his breath was like steam in the
bitter cold outside all was black the
snow hissing down venomously
kioga of the wilderness



  he felt something fluttering against
his face and reached forward to seize
an upright stick taking it inside he
found it to be the leathered cow-stick
of wounded knee

  waking his hunters kioga told them
the councilors have gone out alone
then he rushed out ten braves at his
heels the snow stung like shot bind-
ing them there was no way to follow
a trail so said the braves but kioga
did not hear he was already far out on
the unseen trail for to his ears had come
a sound faint but familiar which he fol-
lowed

  it was a death-song rising monoto-
nously on the whistling wind and fading
a little way he went then checked the
chant came from an opposite direction
toward which he tur ned-only to hear it
from a third point then from yet a
fourth came that deep chanting fainter
now bewildering coming from every
direction

  kioga paused shouted the names of
the councilors the driven snow stung
his palate he called no more for now
he understood turning back he sought
a scent of smoke found it and on its
thread returned to the camp inside lay
the hunters hardly able to move after
their few exertions and from without
came only the moan of wind the slash
of snow if the snow hawk went out
again and were lost-all these within the
lodge were as dead lor none but he could
now move about and so he sat gazing
at the door through which the four old
men had passed

the storm abated morning dawned
clear brilliant sharply cold a little
rested the braves accompanied kioga
slowly out they found the old coun-
cilors-at widely separated points frozen
stiff and buried in snow they found
them easily by the markers over their
icy graves above eacl man-except
wounded knee-flattering bright red
and yellow and blue in the reddish morn-
ing sunrise was an upright cott-stick
wounded knee was never found he
had left his coup-stick before the lodge
where kioga found t the previous night

  wise councilors cunning councilors
knowing they would be followed they
had separated singing their death-chants
as they went the better to discourage
pursuit weary at last one by one and
alone they had dug deep their cow-sticks
and squatted down never to rise they
had sacrificed themselves for their people

that these might carry on unhampered
wounded knee bels-his-shirt chases-
the-cow iron horse four brave old
great-hearted men tottering into eter-
nity in the best tradition of their race

  all that day in the hunger-lodge the
pleading drum of moons son young
medicine-man and self-appointed vision-
ary of the band beat with growing weak-
ness stupor had claimed some of the
lodges occupants the teelli of tokala
chattered with cold and weakness the
shadow of death lay across that lone
lodge of starvation waiting to creep in
when the diminished firewood should at
last be exhausted

            

and that afternoon as if in answer
 to the singing of moons son and
across the graves of those who had died
that food might go farther appeared
the vanguard of the migrating caribou-
herds first a small band loping slowly
along then scattered groups later small
herds then larger until at last as far as
the eye could reach they came the clat-
tering of their antlers creating a roar
that could be heard for miles

  with the coming of caribou the cruel
gods of the north must have smiled for
of all who heard the animals pass only
kioga had strength even to come forth
and look at them then throw wide the
lodge-flap that others might see and per-
chance take strength from the sight and
it was a cruel game starvation played
with those who watched the snow hawk

  with dragging feet he pursued the
active animals saw them coming on
every side smelled the mellow scent of
their endless numbers and heard the
clack of antler and hoof on the hard
snow never hitherto had he taken ac-
count of his strength always like the
flow of a mighty cataract it had been
there in boundless tide when needed no
man had ever successfully challenged it
and no beast in far natowa was his
equal when to strength he added his
cunning

  but now kioga knew his weakness he
who once could have run a caribou down
in fair chase now crept upon the herds
in vain those who watched lost heart

  kioga had fallen and now lay quiet

 then of a sudden tokala shouted
weakly moons sons drum picked up
its faltering beat which rose to a swift
tattoo at what the medicine-man saw

  forth from the snow hawks prone po-
sition went his bony hand a caribou
bull wounded in battle with a fellow bull


the blue book magazine

had stood bleeding on this spot kioga
was crushing the frozen nourishment in
his teeth little by little some of his
strength returned at length he slowly
took up his bow and nocked an ar-
row he drew the cord he held his
point upon the nearest bull the string
twanged loud and vibrant the bull
leaped high breaking its neck in its fall
and lay dead pierced through the heart

  again and again the bended bow the
musical note of plucked cord the jar of
the recoiling arc as the feathered reeds
whipped forth dropping each a running
caribou until the hunters quiver lay
empty at his hand but twenty fat ani-
mals lay dead in the snow

  soon the lodge was filled with the
aroma of simmering roast ribs and tender
brisket plump tongues were hung to
smoke heads were roasted whole and the
fatty nose-gristle eaten first

  it was a great feast the bones were
full of rich marrow and there was so
much meat that already the dogs were
gorged to repletion and struggling to de-
vour yet more when they felt able the
hunters went forth now and shot down
caribou as long as their arrows held out
then pulled them free of the dead ani-
mals and shot again

  so from starvation to luxurious living
kiogas band went in one day

  and over the old councilors the
feathers fluttered   

  now the sun rose above the southern
horizon upon a happy camp the brown
caribou-skin lodges hugged the snow
under blue plumes of smoke that rose
vertically and feathered away southward
the dogs tussled and wrestled and lolled
about tongues hanging contentedly

  treachery self-sacrifice famine and
surfeit and death had visited the camp
many times but returning to the tents
next night kioga heard a thin wail
entering he learned that grass girl
wife of the delighted young moons son
had gone out to bring in meat and been
absent overlong uneasiness gripped tfie
women until she was seen returning slow-
ly with a back-load of meat steadied
with one hand while in the other she
tenderly bore her f rst-born-a healthy
screaming boy-child with the easy ac-
couchement of the native mother she
had been delivered of her child beside a
caribou carcass life was balancing the
scale

  the little newcomer was given its
secret name what that name was i
cannot tell for the baby-name is never
spoken lest evil spirits annoy the child
but to the warriors grass girls son was
thenceforward known as plenty meat

chapter vii

the frozen desert

the caribou horde had come and
passed south but the sledges were
loaded with dried meat and the dogs so
glutted they scarce could walk prepara-
tions were being made for a quick de-
parture with early morning in his tent
kioga was whetting his arrows sharp
and affixing a wrisc-strap to the whip
when a sudden violent clamor from the
dogs sent him bounding forth whip in
hand pausing not even to don his cari-
bou-skin coat
kioga of the wilderness



  the melee raged fiercely a hundred
feet from the tents in full view under
the silver flood of the moons light the
unlucky dogs contended with foes more
dread than one another two white
wolves doubtless having scented fresh
meat fought silently among them gaunt
from long running trained to leather
hardness by their pursuit of the vanished
caribou their onset was in marked con-
trast to the resistaice by the sluggish
dogs gorged with meat and further
hampered by the dangling traces

  one of the dogs a ready lay twitching
mangled and torn and as the snow
hawk bore down upon them the male
wolf of the pair with three snaps ripped
open another dog in an irtstant

  rushing from their tents the indians
now learned the true function of that
long lash which the snow hawk carried
it was as much a weapon as a bow even
as they watched forth sang the unerring
plaited thong quick as a cobras strike
and as deadly almost to draw blood and
leave a deep gash wherever it touched a
wolf the dogs with courage renewed
by the presence of an ally attacked more
boldly and to better effect the wolves
their fighting edge dulled by the scourg-
ing of the lash suddenly turned tail and

were away dogs in pursuit but the
heavy dogs were no match for the speed
of their wild brothers and soon returned
to camp to lie about licking their wounds
of which one died during the night

  the party proceeded next morning at
somewhat reduced pace owing to the
loss of two dogs well on their way one
of the wolves was found dead frozen
stiff on the plain the body was cut up
thawed out and fed to the dogs

it was only a few miles to the arctic
ocean now fed and clothed the
band moved steadily on several of the
men aiding the teams especially that
which drew the sledge heavily loaded
with depouillc-the pure back-fat of the
caribou

  they came that night to an aban-
doned eskimo camp where they slept
and on the morrow changed their course
running on smooth shore ice now hith-
erto they had run the dogs in tandem
but now they changed to the fan for-
mation and with the dogs thus hitched
abreast made better time several days
found them in the area near which kioga
had first encountered the scientist dr
james munro after his abandqnment on
the ice


the blue book magazine

  the snow hawk was mindful now of
how his hazardous journey to the main-
land had been interrupted a year earlier
when a white bear marauding by nature
and hungry besides had destroyed his
camp accordingly he cautioned his
hunters concerning the risks attendant
on ice-travel with emphasis on the huge
white wanderers which have clawed and
despoiled their way into the diaries of
every northern expedition from this
time on an alternate sentry guarded the
camp at all hours

  the sentry it was who entered the
snow-house that night with word that a
sledging part had halted a mile distant
whether with hostile or friendly intent
he could not determine seated before
the oil-lamps with tokala kioga drew on
his furs and emerged-to see a band of
eskimo at some distance pointing to the
camp and evidently at disagreement
among themselves on some point

  gesturing kioga observed that his
greeting was returned by one of the
strangers who pointedly threw aside his
weapons and holding aloft both hands
advanced halfway toward the camp act-
ing in like manner kioga came to with-
in a hundred paces of the man in the
semi-darkness the eskimo shouted
something in an unknown tongue hav-
ing no other alternative kioga called
back a greeting in english little ex-
pecting to hear an intelligible answer he
started when english syllables far from
perfect but plain enough fell from the
lips of the eskimo

  we eskimo kamotok me look
for seal no find him yet

  at utterance of that name the snow
hawk strained his eyes across the ice
then hurried forward the eskimo sus-
pecting treachery turned to move away
when the snow hawk checked him with
a question

  where is lualuk of the one hand
kamotok 

  in surprise the eskimo wheeled
  who are you who know lualuk

  i am kioga friend of dok-ta-mun
answered the snow hawk using the
name by which dr munro had been
known to his eskimo dog-drivers

kamotoks subsequent actions un-
der constant watchful observation
by the curious members of kiogas band
startled the indians he shouted aloud
in his excitement threw back a few
words to his friends at the sledge they
instantly hurried yelling across the ice

in the wake of their leader who was
rushing upon kioga

  the indians snatched up their weapons
and ran to meet the eskimo ready to
meet force with force but when they
arrived on the scene to their amazement
they found kioga the center of an en-
thusiastic mob kamotok was pumping
his hand and plying him with a hundred
eager questions with the snow hawk
laughing at their enthusiasm and answer-
ing as fast a he was able while one-
handed lualuk anxiously awaited an op-
portunity to speak

having made his indians known to
kamotoks people and allayed
somewhat the eskimo distrust of indians
-their hereditary foes-kioga next in-
vited the eskimo to their lodges where
all partook heartily of the prized back-
fat of the caribou

  influenced by this good cheer and the
friendship of their leaders round-faced
eskimos and lean-jawed red men were
soon at ease in each others strange so-
ciety from kamotok-whose long as-
sistance to the american scientist had
given him his working knowledge of
english-the indians learned why kioga
was so highly esteemed in this remote
corner at the top of the earth lualuk
held forth ihe stump of his hand and
jabbered something at kamotok who
turned to the migrant band

  he say tell you kioga kill club-
foot

  who was club-foot piped up to-
kala the fox who had drunk all this in
in silence the eskimo grinned down at
the boy white bear ver-ry big bite
off lualuks hand kioga kill with
knife see he showed the boy a
strip of bear-skin sewn into his right
glove i take this from that big club-
foot i am lucky  time-kill plenty
seal now nanuk-him ver-ry strong
not so strong as kioga

  thus from the lipis of an eskimo the
band learned a little more of the strange
career of their friend and leader the
snow hawk

  thereafter kioga talked long and
earnestly with kamo ok of ice-conditions
north and west anc of the possibilities
for seal- and walrus-hunting he learned
much but of the area which most con-
cerned him kamotok could tell him
nothing for there were lines beyond
which the eskimo never went and of
any large land north of the siberian
coast the man was completely ignorant
kioga of the wilderness



  but the information kioga received
concerning the eskimo method of hide
boat-making was invaluable and the
gifts from the generous eskimo band
almost as much so among these were a
few lamps for burring seal-oil to light
and warm their igloos on the way two
ice-axes several fine sealing-harpoons
one with a steel heac  and several lengths
of seal-hide rope out of his great good
will kamotok would have included his
prized rifle but this the snow hawk
would not accept thus far their primi-
tive weapons had kept them in meat de-
prived of his gun kamotok might perish
and many of his people with him

  in return for these gifts kioga emptied
his pockets of their coins a small in-
itialed pen-knife a gold watch and
sundry other little articles these he
deposited before the glistening eyes of
kamotok

  for you and your people in return
he said and now we have one other
need for five good strong dogs we will
give as much caribou fat as your men
here can bear away on their backs
kamotok turned to one of his hunters
and spoke a few words the mans face
was wreathed in a great smile as he
agreed eagerly turning back to kioga
kamotok said simply it is done
both sides were well pleased with the
arrangement with fresh dogs the in-
dian band could make up for those lost
the eskimo to whom nothing is so nec-
essary as animal fat were delighted

the following rrorning the eskimo
saw the departure of snow hawk and
his strange band and looked with wonder
after him who spoke of a land of which
they knew nothing

  once again possessed of fast strong
dogs and well-equipped for their forth-
coming battle with the ice kioga and his
party drove their animals onward they
spent the night in comfort beside their
seal-oil lamps in the shelfer of a snow-
hut lined with caribou-skin and built
like the eskimo dwellings they had left

  only by adopting the ways of people
who made the ice their home could they
hope to survive where so many others
better equipped and prepared had per-
ished accordingly their dress was now
adapted to conditions on the ice all
but the most necessary sledging equip-
ment was discarded until in the end
they retained but the eskimo minimum
meat fur bags to sleep in and the
weapons and clothing on their backs

  within their well-made igloo of snow-
blocks men and women and dogs alike
slept together to take advantage of the
common warmth again they were en-
tirely dependent on their hunting weap-
ons for meat for of provisions they
could carry at most but two weeks sup-
ply where the ice was broken up by
wind or pressure they took an occasional
seal with the harpoon kioga taught
the indians how to be constantly alert
for seal-holes in solid ice-those under-
ice chambers gnawed from below
through which the seal breathes thus
they had an occasional if precarious
source of fresh meat nothing was
wasted nothing thrown away the seal-
skins became part of their garments
the bones were ground with blood and
made into thick nourishing soup the
least palatable parts were fed to the
dogs and the seal-oil kept their lamps
alight thus they existed on the frozen
desert beneath which in frigid water
lie the bones of many whose expeditions
were far better found than this wild no-
mads camp

  one morning the band had harnessed
the dogs preparing to hitch them to
the sledges when with an excited clamor
the animals suddenly took off at a furious
pace struggling vainly to hold them
back tokala was dragged along behind
sprawled on his little fur-clad belly and
gripping the trace twisted round his
wrists

  almost as soon as the dogs the trained
nostrils of the snow hawk drank in the
scent

  bear he cried over one shoulder as
he picked up an ice-ax from the sledge
and bounded after the dogs bring
harpoons and bows 

  hard on the heels of the huskies
pressed the snow hawk overhauling
them at last amid a jagged mass of
rough ice at the center of which in a
depression surrounded by gleaming pin-
nacles stood an ice-bear of the breed
known as nanuk the tiger of the arctic

its short heavy ears were screwed
back saliva dripped from the yellow
bared incisors and froze instantly like
spun glass the close-set little eyes
blazed diabolically in the triangular
head which almost touched the ice ef-
fectively cftvering the long cream-yellow
throat beneath the long high quarters
the bulging muscles rolled as nanuk
swayed upon the rigid pillars of his
broad and shaggy limbs
with kioga pursuing the
walrus flung themselves
on the floe where the in-
dian hunters lay in wait

  before him with eviscerated belly
yawning to the sky lay the dog who
had ventured too boldly and straining
away with terrified yelps were two
others still in the traces which bound
them to their unlucky fellow from
whose carcass the bears immense red-
stained paw pressed the dark blood

  his gaze already darting about seek-
ing tokala kioga had advanced to where
the dogs ringed the bear at a respectful
distance and then the snow hawk to
whom fear was unknown felt his blood
rim cold

  prone before the bear within range of
the curving claws of that massive hairy
forepaw lay tokala the fox

  for an instant kioga thought him
dead then realized that the boys eyes
wide and staring were fixed in dread
fascination upon the bear he called a
quick low warning tokala-lie still
and as if dead do not answer me but
when the arrow strikes in and the bear
turns-jump and run

  an iron-headed shaft already strained
against kiogas cord came a twang as
the bow hurled its bolt the bear grunted
a muffled roar and snapped back at the
wooden agony skewering his loin an-
other arrow sank into its side and at
point-blank range kioga pumped yet two
more deep in to the feathers

  tokala had now risen on hands and
knees for the first time kioga realized
why he could not jump and run as in-
structed his foot was caught and
twisted up in the dead dogs trace as

the bear wheeled in a circle snapping
and tearing at the arrows the boys
movement caught his eye pausing only
to smash an attacking dog into a pulp
the bear rushed upon tokala

  simultaneously kioga resorted to the
sole remaining means of saving tokala-
his long sharp knife in two bounds
from behind he was fastened to the bears
shaggy shoulders the plunge plunge
of his dripping blade checked the beast
in mid-charge just as the first of the
indians topped the nearest ice pinnacle

  shaking itself within its loose thick
skin the dying anirnal reared and fell
back seeking to crush its assailant but
as it fell kioga writhed from under and
laid hold of the forgotten ice-ax one
mighty chop upon the skull quick as the
fall of a meteorite and the bear sank
down prey to the frenzied worrying of
the dogs already swarming over the life-
less foe

  shouting and gesticulating the indians
scrambled excitedly down into the little
amphitheater of ice and surrounded the
snow hawk who knelt beside tokala
feeling the boys ankle

  as soon as the women came up the
clicking knives were busy again separat-
ing the bear from its heavy skin one
of the warriors plunged deep his knife
and reaching in drew forth the bears
kioga of the wilderness



and made them leap across or in the case
of those which balked threw them over
bodily whereafter the sledges were
hauled across but hummocky ice gave
them exhausting work smashing a way
through with their ice-axes men as well
as dogs here strained against the sledge-
traces and where the ice towered about
them on every side shutting them in
they traveled by dead reckoning or by
watching the stars

  even worse peril than ice itself was
its lack one night clouds shut out the
stars and a milder wind blew softening
the surface where the sledges had
slipped along easily before they now
sank deep and the dogs likewise floun-
dered up to their bellies in soft slush
some of the meat was transferred to
back-packs but much more had to be
abandoned during that night while
taking a rest enforced by sheer weariness
the dogs became restless and whined un-
easily awakening kioga

  he was soon conscious of movement of
the ice underfoot and of an occasional
ominous crunching which passed near by
and moved into the distance wind and
unseasonable warmth were combining to
break up the ice on which they moved-
the field on which they had slept was in
perceptible motion and it was no time
for sleep

  throw the meat from the sledges
was the first order kioga gave we

heart of which he ate a small piece and
handed it around among the others
thus by the logic cf the indian hunter
they partook of the animals courage
the long claws were cut off and later
strung on rawhide which in turn was
sewn upon kiogas parka

  again the dogs were well fed this time
upon bear-haunch while the indians
regaled themselves upon the thick bear-
liver cooked in a seal-oil flame

  the snow hawk as he ate thought
back a few short months to a time when
he had walked in the busy marts of
civilization and he who had eaten ten-
course dinners drunk from priceless
crystal and wiped his lips on snowy
napery now bit off another piece of bear-
liver and when he had finished he
licked his fingers anc quenehed his thirst
with melted arctic ice he had but one
regret concerning the material things he
had put behind and that was for the
tingling shower of a modern bathroom
neither he nor his companions had
bathed for many weeks

level ice once attained offered no
j obstacles to the rapid passage of the
indian band now hardened by exposure
and strengthened by an abundance of
meat when an occas onal fissure yawned
before them they unhitched the dogs


the blue book magazine

come soon to open water where there
will be meat in plenty in view of the
unexpected break-up of the ice he knew
now that they were not many miles from
the warm currents which temper the
climate of natowa

  with the sledges lightened they pushed
on anew everywhere fissures now ap-
peared with open water between where
these were very wide they moved along
the edge until they found a cake or pan
of ice sufficiently large to bear their
weight-then ferried across the watery
lanes it was unmitigated toil now but
none complained

at the edge of an open lane kioga
 finally called a halt to allow the
stragglers to come up and now the wind
changed again frost set in and two
inches of ice-enough to lock in the float-
ing pans but not enough for safe sledge-
travel-formed on the surface their
situation was critical the wind was
bitterly cold there was nothing left of
which to make a fire they hungered
terribly from the toil of this endless
march and the meat was all gone

  but in the north those who turn back
are almost always lost push on they
must trusting to kiogas judgment that
they must soon come to the open water
-and seals kioga ordered the dogs har-
nessed again and turned to his drivers

  you buffalo child drive three hun-
dred paces to the south you crow
man as many toward the north i with
my team will take the middle course
the women and aged will go first scat-
tered that we may see them safe turn-
ing to these move swiftly and do not
once stop if mishap befall one let all
the others continue on their way for
if one fall through the ice surely two
would break it in the more easily if it
be the will of the great ones we shall
pass if not- give me your hands each
one we have come far together

  quietly all shook hands then one
by one well separated the women and
the old man moved fan-wise out across
the thin field when they were well
past halfway over the teams drew apart
and to the crack of the whips and the
shouts of the drivers the sledges started
cautiously over the ice thus for per-
haps half the distance to solid footing-
when of a sudden the dreaded cry echoed
from mouth to mouth

  run run  the ice breaks up 

  obedient to orders those in the front
hurried on as fast as their limbs would

carry them old four braids unsteady
at best went through to the knees but
dragged himself flat along the ice rose
and continued on under the sledges
the thin ice was quaking and sagging
wild with fear the dogs galloped with
the lashes hissing over their heads and
the hai hail-hail hail of the
drivers beating into heir ears on crow
mans team one dog slipped and was
dragged a hundred yards before he could
attain his feat buffalo child feeling
the ice going beneath him ran safely
away to one side diseasing the weight
in the area of his sledge which slid
swiftly on passing into a zone of com-
parative safety

  kioga alone with his lesser team of
but four dogs where the others numbered
five seemed in difficulty to the indians
who could pause and watch the flat
sameness of the ice appeared to be sink-
ing in a long concavi ty where the weight
of the sledge man and dogs bore upon
the thin skin blanketing the sea they
could hear the pistol-shot reports of his
moose-hide lash and his low appeals to
the dogs straining every sinew to obey
they saw him without pausing dash
piece after piece of its load from the
sledge until it was quite empty save for
tokala who rode white-faced clutching
his lynx-kitten to his breast

  with horror they saw disaster creep-
ing upon the fast-moving sledge just
behind the snow hawk in the wake of
the sledge the ice was cracking in his
footsteps once he went in with one
leg but seizing the sledge drew himself
along behind it so that his pounding
feet might not strain the ice again then
behind the sledge itself like a scratch
which follows the diamond drawn across
glass there appeared a continuous break
in the ice

kioga bent grasped tokala by the
wrist swung him back and with a
mighty toss flung him skimming along
the ice still clutching his lynx-kitten
into the arms of waiting indians

  but under the pressure of his exertion
the sledge grated harshly and went under
astern checked the dogs piled up fell
in a tangle sea-water welled up from
every break in the sagging skin-ice
kioga slashed at the traces with his
sharp knife to separate dogs from sledge
and then with a great splash it hap-
pened

  the sledge sank like a stone dragging
man and entangled struggling dogs into
kioga of the wilderness	

the hole which had claimed it the
yapping of the animals was quenched in
sea-water silence reigned over the
tragedy spot only the squeaking of
the small-ice about the hole marked the
sinking of man and team

  came the wail of a heartbroken boy
shrill and distinct  the frosty air as
tokala the fox shouted again and again
the name of kioga his idol

  a moment suspense and the realization
of dread tragedy held every soul in thrall
then of a sudden tokala glimpsed what
the rest overlooked and his shout of
discovery broke the spell

  ranging across the ice was a limp wet
length of leathern whip-thong one end
lapped twice about an icy pinnacle where
it was swiftly freezing even as they
watched the lash snapped taut out of
the steely sea appeared a wet and soggy
mitten followed by the streaming face
and head of the snow hawk

in an instant the indians had grasped
the lash and were straining to draw
him upon solid ice this was no simple
feat for he had hold of the dogs trace
but many hands accomplished the seem-
ingly impossible when kioga attained
his feet he in turn dragged three half-
drowned coughing dogs to safety

  the sledge however had gone to the
bottom and taken one dog with it there-
after it was not an ejsy task to dry out
kiogas sea-soaked clothing in the heat
of their tiny oil-flame but after a delay
of several hours it was done preparing
to start anew the srow hawk was at-
tracted by the howling of the dogs he
had saved they had dropped to their
bellies to rest and vere frozen to the
ice beyond all possibility of self-liber-
ation ensued another delay while the
band chopped them carefully free tended
and bound up their sore feet and removed
some of the ice from their coats finally
they were moving agin   

  ahead was sound solid ice across
which they presently marched well light-
ed on their way the dance of the spirits
-the aurora-was throwing its flickering
witchery over the floes tinging cold ice
with hues of warm copper and greenish-
blue in the southeast the slow dawn
was heralded by a deep red glare and
with the passing of hours the sun slowly
rose like a spinning metal disk emerging
from intolerable flame with its rise the
ice became a wonder-world ablaze with
vari-colored fires the frosty floes gleam-
ing like sheets of gold resplendent with

a gem-work of blazing rubies amethysts
and emeralds before the spectacle the
band fell silent

  but the glory soon passed curtained in
full glow by ever more frequent waves
of mist dark leaden-hued thick almost
as smoke from a prairie-fire through
this the band moved with all caution for
several days until they came again to
open water here they camped to take
inventory of their resources

  though they had three bows an ice-
ax one harpoon and a length of line be-
tween them all else including arrows
tomahawks and most of the meat had
been thrown aside in their flight across
young ice their little meat was soon
gone to return was impossible the only
alternative was to seek a pan of ice large
enough to bear their combined weight
and chance all on ferrying across the
watery lead upon this plan as set forth
by kioga the band agreed unanimously

  soon the mists rose a little permitting
them a glimpse of the sea at what he
saw kiogas heart gave a mighty leap

  seals sported in the ground-swell near
by from afar came the reverberant
roaring of a sea-lion herd swimming rap-
idly northward a hundred yards away
a whale showed its fluke sank leaped
suddenly clear of the sea and fell back
resoundingly creating a wave that
washed up on their floe by this evi-
dences the snow hawk confirmed his
earlier conclusion that they were on the
edge of that great warm arctic current
which so far as is now known surrounds
the land of natowa far across it below
the horizon he knew were the barrier-
reefs which gird that impregnable land
with a labyrinth of rocky treachery

  to a modern naturalist the very pres-
ence of sea-lions would have seemed
anomalous thus far north of their an-
cient harems on the pribilof islands but
an all-wise all-provident creator alone
may set the hour of a species extinction
nature decreed that the sea-lion and his
fellow-unfortunate the almost vanished
sea-otter should forsake their age-old
southward migration to find haven from
man the destroyer and a breeding-place
in the warm currents about natowa

morning came after a night of rest
and they were preparing to carry
out their plan to ferry across the open
water when tokala the fox ran into
camp with startling tidings

  we are already drifting he panted
the main ice is far back  


the blue book magazine

  it was true their floe had become
detached from the solid field barely
visible in the distance southeast their
course therefore was north and west
with which they found no fault that
night however their floe divided itself
like some gigantic amceba into several
lesser floes and shortly thereafter a
dangerous situation disclosed itself to the
band it was grass girl the mother of
plenty meat who voiced it thus

  the ice is cold the water is warmer
our camp is melting out from under us
beat your medicine-drum o my hus-
band that the ears of the great ones
may know we pray to them for if we
come not soon to land we will leave our
bones in the ocean

  moons son obeyed thumping his
medicine-drum all night and in the morn-
ing its sound was still to be heard across
the steel-blue waters kioga heard it as
he surveyed the newest inroads of the
sea upon their floe about its edges
spongy ice fell away at a thrust of his
harpoon and at central points the floe
was badly honeycombed they dwelt
today upon a little world of ice which
was disintegrating under them

  perhaps the great ones above did
hear or perhaps a pack of three great
killer-whales was to blame for a small
herd of sea-lions taking temporary refuge
on the far end of the floe kioga stole
upon these their barking and roaring
a thrilling medley in his ears

within throwing distance he rose
swiftly he hurled the harpoon
with deadly force straight through the
nearest bulls heart five cows struck
the waters simultaneously and escaped
but a young bull startled by its com-
panions downfall bolted back from the
bleeding animal and by a stroke of good
fortune kioga was enabled to cut it off
pounce upon and dispatch it cleanly and
quickly with a few knife-thrusts

  a shout to the band brought everyone
running the kills were dragged to camp
and the skins separated from the meat
with the thick flipper-skin the women re-
newed the worn boot-soles of the band
sewing it on with sea-lion sinews the
heavy slabs of fat replenished their sup-
ply of fuel-oil for the lamps and the
hungry dogs fought over great chunks of
meat tossed to them from the ample sup-
ply now available

  but with the ice-ax kioga was breaking
up the sledges carefully and measuring
the skins with his eye

chapter viii

natowa natowa

all day the snow hawk worked with
 ax and knife cunningly joining to-
gether pieces of sledge-wood bound with
seal-skin strips and shaped into ribs for a
canoe these he afixed to a longer keel-
piece and before the eyes of the indians
a kayak took form over the frame he
drew the raw sea-lion skins pulling them
taut as a drumhead about the curved
ribbing

  meanwhile the women worked upon
the intestines of the sea-lions slitting
flattening and suppling them of these
strips sewn togethei he fashioned a crude
decking for the makeshift kayak with
more care a finer craft would have re-
sulted but haste was vital a fact
pointedly indicated by the constant
breaking away of sections from their
floe kioga knew of course that all
could not seek safety in this little craft
if it served him in driving sea-animals
within reach of the bands weapons it
would have done al he expected of it

  having completed his work he made a
brief tour of the little island of ice which
was their home convinced that it would
hang together for several days more he
then lay down for a few hours of well-
earned rest and refreshed rose at dawn
with the others prepared for an arduous
day filled with excitement and peril

  the kayak which he had left afloat
the night before having leaked not one
drop presented an interior dry as a chip
a paddle was madi of sledge-wood up-
on the covered deck he laid the harpoon
and turned to his indians they awaited
his words at the edge of the floe the
only ice visible new on all the flat ex-
panse of sea

  hear me warriors said the snow
hawk yonder a band of awuks people
swim if we had tine to wait they would
soon come to lie upon our ice but there
is not time i go then to invite them
here see that you make them welcome
with your sharp spears awuk and his
folk are stupid avoid the cows if with
young creep slew and silent among
the great bulls farthest from the water
kill swiftly with well-aimed strokes that
many may die before the rest become
alarmed keep the dogs hidden and
away  i go

  with that the snow hawk embarked
in his kayak moving quietly away from
the floe an hour passed he circled
far out around tie little walrus-herd
kioga of the wilderness



then slowly came upon them gently
thumping his hollow canoe with the flat
of the paddle the herd cautious but
not alarmed moved away toward the
floe thus by imperceptible degrees the
strategy was wrought the walrus mov-
ing a little kioga pursuing leisurely at
last that which he had anticipated tran-
spired one at a time or two by two
the walrus flung themselves on the floe
where the indian hunters lay in wait

  it proved to be not a hunt but rather
a slaughter wind and sun favored the
indians the breeze blew from the wal-
rus and they blinked their none too keen
eyes in the rising sunlight with lances
improvised from sledge-wood to which
their knives were fixed the band crept
up ten bulls quivered in the death-
struggle before the rest took warning
then such a bellowing as seldom rives
the silence of those waters echoed across
to kiogas ears several more of the
gigantic visitors fell lanced to the heart

  kioga meanwhile approached with ex-
treme slowness having taken in tow the
first evidence of land a small tree of
many branches which he recognized as
one of a variety which grows on the
coasts of natowa he brought it along
not only to encourage the band but also
for its tough resilient boughs which
would be sore needed in the construction
of a craft large enough to bear all to
safgty

  within hearing of he indians on the
ice he was suddenly aware that their
shouts contained not the jubilation of
successful hunters but frantic notes of
warning the voice of tokala rose
shrilly above the othe -s

 behind you lock back

  a swift rearward glance revealed to
kioga the cause of the ir alarm-a school
of four orcas the dread killer-whales be-
lieved by eskimo to be the reincarna-
tion of land-wolves a moment the snow
hawk watched narrowly as they ap-
proached swiftly side by skle their im-
mense black dorsal fins erect a sinister
spectacle even as hs watched an im-
mense sea-lion leaped frantically from
the sea in their path but too late to avoid
the closing of great jaws armed with
row on row of deadly teeth

 with the pack-unity of wolves the
orcas paused to do murder while kioga
bent every energy toward reaching the
floe with his clumsy tow a hundred
yards lay between him and safety when
the orcas moved again through bloody
foam in their relentless formation as

look on me--and say if you know not my
name said the newcomer sternly

 they approached the analogy was plain
 again-water-wolves an ocean pack bent
 on rapine their back-fins slashing the
 water like great blunt glaives

  no man in a kayak saw they but a
 long seal-like shape basking as it were
 at the waters surface near the floe in
 a body they sounded and for a long
 minute there was a silence then the
 sea seemed to erupt killer whales ten
 yards from the snow hawks tiny craft
 full length from the water leaped the
 orcas like immensely enlarged salmon
 from each rounded head a snowy plume
 of spray jetted hissing up as one ani-
 mal they fell upon the frail skin cockle-
 shell smashing it to shreds amid a
 smother of foam and the lash and thrash
 of mighty fins and broad thick-muscled
 tails

   but blood was not let in that fearful
 assault no fool was kioga to pit his
 lesser muscles against beasts like these
 on the instant of their reappearance
 with their spouting loud in his ears he
 abandoned the kayak stepped upon the
 tree drawing abreast of himand balanc-
 ing like a wire-walker darted its length
 ankle-deep in water as he approached
 its thick end the blunt white-chinned
 snout of an orca jutted forth between
 him and the floe too late to pause-the
 tree-trunk was settling under his weight
 -he executed a mighty leap full upon
 the slippery back of the blowing orca
 and flung his line to the ice as he
 alighted half-blinded by the animals
 steamy blast he drove the harpoon deep
 within an inch of the palpitating spout-
 hole

   simultaneously the whale thrashed the
 sea into milky froth and that had as-
 suredly been the end of kioga but for
 the presence of mind of moons son the
 medicine-man who took three quick
 turns of the line about a ridge of ice as


the blue book magazine

the orca sounded the weapon was torn
from the wound and kioga still gripping
its handle was hauled to safety

  already the others were sinking on the
blood-trace of their stricken fellow-a
grim trail that ended in cannibalism a
mile distant whereafter well-gorged
the remaining three killer whales were
seen no more

  again under the moons light the
sounds of ax were renewed from the tree
the snow hawk hewed away the excess
branches leaving only several at regular
intervals on either side bent up from
the bole which was to be the keel the
branches were as ribs stayed with hide
ropes and bound at all points of stress by
hide thong the sharp knives had had
their way with the tough walrus-skins
men and women alike labored with bone
awls and needles drawing thread larger
than the hole through it was forcibly
pulled to bind the interlocking seams
together in a water-tight union so the
oomiak skin was assembled

  slowly the craft took a form at which
an eskimo would have laughed-unless
he too lived on a world that melted swift-
ly away beneath his feet when it was
completed many hands moved it to the
waters edge and lowered it gently

  sea-water welled through the skin bot-
tom but the dismay of the indians
was short-lived as the skins became
water-soaked the seams swelled no
more brine was then admitted but the
work of construction was done none too
soon near by another great chunk of
the floe cracked away with a splash

  a short journey convinced kioga that
the craft would bear them safely across
open water at least to the reefs about
natowa qn the morrow men women
dogs and children took to their rude ark
bearing meat and water in skin bags
to last a week thus they left the floe
behind them

favored by wind and current with-
in a few days they found themselves
within sight of distant shoals extending
to the horizon at either hand mean-
while they had collected another proof
of land near by a sapling this when
trimmed and rigged with their gut tar-
paulins became a tolerably effective mast
and sail giving them additional head-
way  by dawn of the next day they
coasted within sound of the waves roar-
ing over the rocky reefs

  at the bow kioga scanned the rocks
many times he had come hither from the

mainland through a channel known only
to himself which be had discovered by
observing the routes taken by the sharks
infesting the coastal bays of natowa
his eyes sought the landmark which he
had last seen when he piloted the yacht
alberta through the inner labyrinth to-
ward the open sea he saw it at last a
ragged pinnacle of basalt forming a
natural breakwater behind which he
guided his unwieldy craft and its load of
weary humaq freight

this would be their last opportunity
to rest before the final harrowing bar-
rier was conquered and the real shore at-
tained rest they c id on the narrow reef
beside a huge roaring fire of crackling
driftwood the resinous smells of which
were delicious after long weeks in the
reek of a smoky seal-oil flame but im-
patience to reach their goal brought them
early awake with dawn even the dogs
seemed eager for action lightening his
craft by every possible ounce kioga
stripped it to the barest essentials

  fending-poles were made of driftwood
then with an eye to the swift inrush of
the tide the threading of the deadly reefs
was begun in a growing mist in a light
canoe kioga had often made the perilous
passage in three days in the stiff-han-
dling oomiak deep-laden and slow to re-
spond they were that long making half
the distance and were forced by fog to
camp on another rocky reef subsisting
on clams dug from the rocks the dis-
mal mists rolled thicker on every side
immense tidal combers dashed cold
spray over the huddling band

  it was a small thing which sent their
spirits soaring in the midst of fore-
boding with a weary flutter of mist-
wet wings a little wind-battered bird
alighted upon the wet rocks such a
show of indomitable cheer as it then
made must have raised the hearts of con-
demned men its song was a subdued
twitter suddenly bursting into a series
of ear-piercing whistles repeated with
swelling throat five times it ran its
rapid score with comic fearless earnest-
ness when the indians laughed its
crest drooped as if in embarrassment
then it took flight and fluttered shore-
ward through the mists

  but with it went also despair as the
mists rose slightly ihe band again put off
vigorously they fought the great waves
which would have hurled their craft up-
on the rocky ridges turning it safely a
thousand times with their fending-poles
kioga of the wilderness	

  the thousand-and-first time disaster
fell like a lightning-bolt an invisible
reef was suddenly uncovered by a wave
in the trough of which the oomiak rode
to graze it with a sickening rip of the
walrus-hide bottom through which the
sea-water boiled

  they could no more than let her pound
against the nearest reef and abandon as
swiftly as possible one helping another
to the rocky ledge whose under-wate
spur had scuttled their craft it seemed
they had come all this way only to meet
their end within striking range of their
goal but the winds calmed the mists
dissipated the sea came to rest on
the southern horizon the sun rose to but
half the size of an immense fiery orange
before slowly beginning its descent but
by its glorious slanting beams kioga saw
the receding tide had uncovered more of
the ledge on which they stood-and
showed it to be in reality a little rocky
peninsula joined to the mainland they
could wade ashore

  towering forbidd ng inhospitable-
looking as a castles wall a great cliff
reared into the sky beyond its battle-
ments gilded by the vanishing sunlight
in the calm bay below the cliffs a host of
wild-fowl rose in a hanking cloud as a
pair of fisher-eagles swooped in upon
them striking right and left on a little
beach bordering the bzy lay the wrecked
oomiak round about which sandpipers
darted with stiffly mechanical rapidity
like wound-up toys concerned only with
making the most of the short daylight
hours in filling their li tle crops

along moment the band looked upon
these evidences of land-life stunned
by the reality of what they had striven
toward all these long arduous moons
and endeavoring to maintain composure
then suddenly a choked sob escaped
grass girl holding hei babe against her
breast others of the women wept
hysterically the men of themed-skinned
migrants deeply emotional beneath their
stoic veneers did strarge things

  old crow man stood silent with out-
stretched arms great tears rolling un-
heeded down his seamed cheeks from
rock to wet rock leaped the younger men
some to throw themselves bodily down to
kiss the wet sand others to kneel and
filter its particles upon their heads and
shoulders tokala the fox capered
shouting gleefully about the beach his
lynx-kitten still on one arm the uncer-
tain dogs picked their way cautiously

ashore pausing to sniff new scents or
prick up their ears at new sounds while
one nipped astern by the claw of a gi-
gantic rock-crab chased its tail in a
spinning circle

  kioga however knew too well the dan-
gers of this wild coast to tarry and
after their moment of thanksgiving he
led his band along the cliffs toward an
ascending path

  the eager dogs excited by fresh scents
on every hand roved in a scattered group
a hundred yards in advance the band
had in fact barely gained the up-trail
when what the snow hawk sought to
avoid came to pass with such suddenness
that he was powerless to intervene

heedless of several summonses to
return the yelping dogs had gath-
ered around an old bone-pile long since
picked clean by the scavengers and were
here sniffing about of a sudden a score
of lean gaunt shadows materialized as if
from nowhere rounding a bend in the
cliff wall like silent specters and in
their wake flew and circled a noisome
band of croaking ravens and lesser crows

  of all the fierce living things in the
land of natowa none is so much to be
feared as these coastal felons the dire-
wolves who respect nothing that walks
on two legs or four

  running in such close formation that
a room-sized rug would have covered the
pack at the moment of glimpsing the
dogs their tactics changed the inner
segment described an encircling move-
ment cutting off the dogs retreat toward
the cliffs the outer without pause or
hesitation rushed foaming on the prey

  now these were prime giant husky
dogs in fine condition many of them
little less than wild themselves yet
against the leather-tendoned trap-jawed
beasts which attacked they were as suck-
ling puppies came the deadly snick and
slashing snap of fangs on fangs mingling
with the ferocious snarling of the cor-
nered dogs fighting for life itself but
from the gaunt destroyers there came
no vocal sound the dire-wolves of
natowa speak but once before assem-
bling and do their killing in grim silence

  one of the dogs indeed made good his
escape from the first rush but the lead-
er of the second segment laid him out
twitching half his throat bitten away by
a single rabid chop of the jaws from
sight to attack to finish it was over as
appallingly soon as that not one dog
survived when the wolves crouched down


the blue book magazine

to their hot feast pausing now and then
only to slash at the impatient ravens
hovering in black impudent clouds about
their ears

  from a safe height in the cliffs where-
from they could hurl great rocks in case
of attack kiogas band looked upon the
scene which symbolized the gloomy
savagery of this untamed land as word
of mouth could never have done the
faithful companions of their long march
were no more forewarned against the
grim realities of the wilderness round
about them the indians finally con-
tinued their climb scaling the cliffs
atop the ramparts they built a shelter of
rocks wherein to sleep the night and
here kioga warned his party at length as
to the precautions to be taken against
the prowlers of darkness

  take no risks he concluded keep
your fire hooded the shoni scalp-hunt-
ers may be abroad wait patiently with-
in your shelter until i return with meat
be alert to admit me when i call from
the darkness

  with that the snow hawk melted into
the gloom as silently as a leaf grows
over his head the sky was intensely
black shot with the great arctic stars
glittering like silver kioga grateful to
be home drank in the tonic piny air
until it seemed his chest must burst

  at the edge of the evergreen forest he
paused to listen

  moving aground a little way on the
animal trails he sensed something loom-
ing up before him and at a touch of the
shaggy bark knew it for an immense
fallen tree-bole upon this he vaulted
lightly stealing along its slanting length

  now he paused to probe the dark with
widened pupils two shining mirrors
flashed yellow light went out he knew
that a puma prowled near by-and on
that he remembered mika the great
savage panther he had raised from cub-
hood and hunted with by the light of the
arctic moon he recalled aki the bear
that shaggy bulwark of protection who
had defended him from a hundred foes

he kept moving onward into the wind
now and over terrain which had
not known his tread for many moons
his course took him straight along the
lip of a ravine deep in which a tiger
spoke in husky earth-shaking tones and
thence inland skirting the base of a
mountain soon he caught the scent he
sought-an acrid faintly sulphu-ous
smell following this he entered a little

valley in whose shelter the forest was yet
thicker here he came to that place
frequented some tine in its life by every
beast in the forest for fifty miles around
-the hot springs in these curative flu-
ids torn tissues fini comfort

searching out a certain pool kioga
found it occupied by a huge old
grizzly bear splashing joyously about in
the moonlight bellowing with enjoyment
sloughing off his furs upon the aged
bather kioga wait d patiently standing
like some naked god amid the spinning
vapors when the bear emerged shaking
water over a racius of many square
yards kioga gave him time to leave be-
fore depositing his clothing on a con-
venient ledge then he enjoyed that
which he craved more than red meat it-
self-a hot cleansing bath his first in
many weeks in this forest luxury he
reveled for half an hour emerging re-
freshed and with skin aglow to plunge
himself in cold running water near by
then he returned  his clothes

  as he bent above them a few branches
overhead moved and a beam of moon-
light revealed an intruder

  coal-black of body but with mottled
whitish triangles- running down its six
feet of muscular back a rock-viper lay
coiled in the dry warmth of his cast-off
furs its peculiar taint rose to his nos-
trils like the very emanation of death

  frozen to rigidity wnh hand still out-
stretched the win of the snow hawk
sped like lightning to move would but
draw its strike and he would end with
the deadly thing fastened to his flesh

  there was nothing to do but wait-
and hope it would mistake him for a
part of the scenery as he waited in the
expectation of death there flitted past his
ear a pygmy owl uttering its curious
kr-r-r kr-r-r kr-r-r

  like a flash of light the snake lashed
out at the little blur of feathers quick
as the strike came the winged elf evaded
it and perched indignantly on a ledge
near by and in that fraction of a sec-
ond kiogas fingers snapped upon the
snakes clammy neck just below the
head the koang whipped itself round
his arm no mean antagonist even now
with its twenty pounds struggling to get
those fangs home but fingers with the
grip of blacksmiths pincers held it se-
curely then with his knife he severed
the head from the thrashing body he
cleansed the knife and buried the head
under a foot of earth the remainder
kioga of the wilderness



kioga took i p a position behind and to one side of the assemblage now
and then a passing warrior greeted him-sometimes with hostile bearing
but none questioned his identity as ravens tail
	the blue book magazine

he left to the pygmy owl whose coming
had probably saved his life

  then kioga forgot his close brush with
extinction as all wild things forget what
is over and done with and bethought
him of his indians who would be wait-
ing for food naked as he had emerged
from the sulphur-bath he prowled forth
into the dark again

  it was winter in natowa indeed but
the heat in this timbered valley warmed
winter and summer by the hot springs
bubbling in it soon brought the sweat
springing through kiogas pores

in every direction the breeze bore the
scent of meat and so on a rock
ledge affording a moonlight view of an
animal trail kioga crouched in ambush
with knife between teeth awaiting the
coming of game

  soon came one of noble mien and care-
ful step its ten-point antlers edged with
droplets of condensing mist a study in
sepia and quicksilver all unsuspecting
the elk moved under the hunters perch
one step it came and two another and
then-down pounced that lurking shadow

  an instant of plunging blade to hilt in
the creatures side another seizing the
horn with lightning twist dislocating the
spine-thus without sound died kiogas
prey struck down by a master killer

  leaving the viscera for the scavengers
kioga bore his kill back to the springs
donned his furs and turned back toward
the rocky shelter which housed his band
just as the sun rimmed redly over the
southern horizon

  suddenly there came to him upon the
now frosty breeze a sound-the ground-
vibrating temblors of a tigers roar to
you or me one roar would seem like
another to kiogas ear long familiar
with the forests many voices this much
was certain  guna had encountered prey
and in all the forest few willingly miss
witnessing the red drama of a tigers kill-
ing-kioga least of all he turned aside
approaching the stream along which
doubtless guna prowled

  to the snow hawk that deep-chested
challenge brought no slightest quiver
but at a further sound-somewhat like a
kittens mewing-he started almost as if
with fear and threw aside his new-killed
buck

  to another hurrying along the streams
bank sheer terror came it was tokala
the fox armed with a great unwieldy
club that was more a burden than an arm
in his small hand who paused quivering

as the tiger spoke hours since he had
slipped away from the indian camp seek-
ing only the highest felicity life held for
him-to be at ths snow hawks side
lighted until now by the aurora un-
scathed save by ihe devils-club which
had lacerated him when he sought pro-
tection from preying beasts behind its
sharp bayonets st  in one arm he bore
his cherished pet the lynx-kitten and it
was the voice of tiaia little creature that
had caught the tigers ear-and kiogas

  and now tokalas eyes fastened in
dread fascination on the movement in the
undergrowth whence rolled that terrify-
ine sound

  from a thicket there slowly emerged
into the light stripe by stripe a beast of
splendid majesty a massive orange-
colored head adorned with black cross-
bars came slowly into view a pair of
black-tipped thick furred ears surmount-
ed it eyes with the glow and heat of
yellow fire seen through glacial ice fixed
the boy lighted with baleful menace

  now guna rose grunting to a half-
crouch a magnificent beast of the long-
haired breed in full winter coat richly
girt by sable stripes about the glistening
rufous sides the furry cylinder ofits
tail was motionless save at its twitching
end as the animal quivered before launch-
ing its bounding rush the quill-like
whiskers angled backward from the wrin-
kled lips whose upward twitch exposed
the deadly knives those four long curv-
ing yellow seizing-teeth

  in that tense moment the snow hawk
attained the rivers bank above and be-
hind tokala with ready arrow and bow
half-drawn in one glance he foresaw
the frightful destruction to which tokala
stood exposed tokala bravely raised
his club as with short grunting roars the
tiger launched its rushing charge

  simultaneously the snow hawk drew
in advance of the beast and loosed two
lightning shafts in quick succession one
arrow took guna squarely in the eye
the other but pierced a hinder leg bel-
lowing in pain the tiger sped on a
short twenty paces lay before its prey
the animal was closing in a mighty
spring

  then from its blinded side came cata-
pulting one whose lightning onslaught
was as ferocious as the tigers own to-
kala and the fading stars looked upon a
scene plucked from some prehistoric page
in mans forgotten past man and beast
collided obliquely with a force that all
but tore the snow hawks arms from
kioga of the wilderness



their sockets gripping the tigers ruff
with one hand with the other he stabbed
his keen blade repeatedly into the mus-
cled neck severing the great artery

  the roaring tiger reared shaking it-
self like some great dog within its loose
thick overcoat of fur great jets of blood
spraying the river sands but powerful
legs linked him round the loins like iron
chain all deliberately yet with the
practised quickness of many a like en-
counter kioga planted his steel in other
vulnerable ground-working it deep be-
hind the ears where skull meets neck

  a roar ear-splitting in its volume fore-
told the end grimly kioga made good
his hold not daring now to drop away
lest in its paroxysms already begun the
tiger rend him apart

  two shuddering leaps the tiger took
then crashed down dead upon its back
bearing the snow hawk also down to
strike with stunning force against the
hard-packed sand then all was dark
and kioga knew no more

  during all the crowded moments of
the encounter tokala had watched in ter-
ror mixed with amazement half disbe-
lieving that of which his own eyes now
assured him-that even kioga had tri-
urhphed over so fierce a beast as this
feverishly he clubbed the tiger on the
skull

 but now he saw the snow hawk
pinned bleeding and silent under the
huge striped body twice he whispered
the snow hawks name and went unan-
swered with all his strength dragging
at one mighty forepaw tokala sought
vainly to move the giant carcass then
hastily he fled as he had come along the
stream bank back to the indian rock-
camp to bring kioga aid

rousing a few minutes later kioga
 threw off the tigers pinioning weight
looking about for tokala he saw only
footprints in the sand and surmised the
boy had gone for help peufeaps it would
be needed for as he bent to pick up the
deer he had earlier tnrown aside a stab
of pain ran through his thigh neverthe-
less he shouldered the needed meat and
limped on tokalas trail what with
frequent rests to massage his injured leg
back to normal and pauses to make sure
that tokalas tracks had not strayed he
was more than an hour reaching the
cliffs

  he would eat with the band thought
kioga and then recorinoiter near hopeka
-the indian village where once he had

ruled supreme as war-chief tain of all the
shoni tribes he wished to learn their
exact sentiment toward himself for be-
cause of his rescue more than a year ago
of white captives from the storm-driven
yacht alberta whom the indians had
been tormenting at the torture-stake ki-
oga had incurred the wrath of his people

  at hopeka he expected only hostility
but whatever he found he could perhaps
enter the village and appropriate weap-
ons with which to arm his own band
failing that there was still his cave
several marches distant where were
hidden weapons enough for fifty men all
hammered out long ago on his own hid-
den forge   

  approaching the shelter on the cliffs
he noted that the indians had evidently
taken his instructions to heart for they
neither exposed themselves nor was a
fire visible as agreed he called out

  ai-yah meat brothers come with
sharp knives 

  there was no answer laughing at
their caution kioga added

  perhaps you are not hungry per-
haps- but he said no more for at
that moment he suspected what made him
drop his burden of game and rush to the
rock shelter there was no sound
within but as he crossed the threshold
his foot came in contact with something
soft-a human body which he drew to-
ward where the dawn light might shine
on its face

  what he saw need not be dwelt upon
he was looking into the face of moons
son who would beat his magic drum no
more he had been at least an hour
dead to judge from the body tempera-
ture which the snow hawk noted sub-
consciously as one to whom death was no
uncommon sight from the terrible rag-
ged design left by the blade he judged it
had been a bone knife wielded by a shoni
braid-collector and moons son had
been scalped

  a swift glance about in the increasing
light indicated a surprise and a short
struggle the trail further said that the
attackers had hurried their captives off
in a northerly direction even now the
victorious warriors would be embarking
in their canoes and regaling the luckless
captives with picturesquely pantomimed
accounts of the tortures they would sure-
ly undergo

  two courses were open to the snow
hawk he could trail the shoni braves
while the spoor was hot-or anticipate
their arrival at hopeka the village near-


the blue book magazine

est this point on the coast and capital of
the seven tribes and there try to free
his friends he forgot the pain of his in-
jured leg as circling northward he took
the paths that would bring him to a
river debouching into the hiwasi which
flowed past the gates of hopeka

  arrived at a likely spot well screened
by overhanging tree-limbs he lay in wait
this time for nobler prey than deer

chapter ix

the sorcerer

from time to time canoes passed the
snow hawks waiting-place lighted
by pine-knot torches smoking at their
bows but half-visible in the lowered
dusk kioga recognized them by their
lines some were deep-laden with trade-
goods or tribute exacted by the shoni
from the tribes near the mountain passes
and defiles miles in the interior such
things might be bartered at the native
bazaars in return for skins weapons
feather-work or for the skillfully made
fur clothing for which the women of
hopeka are famed

  other craft held couriers bearing mes-
sages from outlying villages or visitors
traveling from one place to another well
favored are the shoni in the possession
of their skein of waterways which are
at once their highways of conquest and
avenues of trade

  none of these did kioga molest until
there came one craft at which his watch-
ing eyes lighted up a small craft it
was manned by a strange figure decked
in all the garish trappings of a witch-
doctor he wore an eye-mask designed
to frighten the beholder an all-enfolding
robe of deer-hides falling almost to the
ankles and marked with mystic medicine-
signs and a headdress of raven tail-
plumes tasseled with strands- of human
hair of the shamans features hidden
by mask and paint little was discernible
as he paddled muttering incantations
into the snow hawks hearing

 what happened then was hidden by
branches overhanging the river the in-
cantations ceased as if choked suddenly
off several large ripples spread out to
midstream and the canoe did not at
once reappear perhaps the medicine-
man communed with some dark spirit
imparting strange secrets

  but soon the craft came forth and in
it there still sat a figure in robe and
feathers and mask as if nothing uncom-

mon had happened indeed the paddler
seemed possessed of fresh strength for
the craft all but flew onward now and
came soon into view of hopeka

  beached before its gates lay hundreds
of canoes among which the eyes of the
lone paddler roved swiftly as if in search
of some one known to him then he
pushed boldly ashcre felt the sand hiss
under the prow and stepped forth carry-
ing a war-club which had lain beneath a
thwart

  he observed that the sentries were in-
attentive to duty for he approached un-
challenged something important must
be transpiring within the walls with
the war-club he rapped on the gates

  who knocks came a startled query
from within

 look on me answered the new-
comer loud and sternly and say if you
know not my name

  there was a subdued colloquy between
two startled guards before one climbed
to gaze down from atop the lofty pali-
sade and cry out to his fellow-sentry
it is ravens tail the sorcerer open
the gates

the huge log barriers fell apart but
just wide enough to admit him they
called ravens tail who strode haughti-
ly in masked wih head carried high
and robe close-wrapped about him the
gate was hurriedly pushed shut

  wherefore such caution sentinel 
asked the supposed shaman of the sentry
standing respectfully by

  a wa-kanek band was seen in the
north by all report o dealer-in-magic
better then to be more vigilant
was the sharp answer then where
were your eyes when i stole upon the
gates 

  you have been absent long o ravens
tail as i hope to die a warrior i knew
you not came the sentrys answer
lamely

  and in my long absence has naught
of importance happened

  does not a shaman know all that may
occur  asked the second sentry with the
faintest trace of sarcasm this brought
the gaze of kioga sharp upon his face
whereat he paled a little and the other
sentry answered

  the winter festival will soon begin
the trading opens thereafter there is
talk of choosing a new warrior-chief
ahi then kioga- began the sup-
posed shaman and paused for the sentry
had stiffened as did his companion
kioga of the wilderness

  to the snow hawk there was no sur-
prise in this he well knew that the men
who did the fighting had small regard
for the shamans who fomented war-
though superstitious fear carefully con-
trived by the medicine-men usually kept
open expressions of hostility quiet

  perceiving that the sentries were
watching him suspiciously he was about
to move on when brzve elk answered
his earlier question with one of his own
cunningly designed to trip him

  knew you not o shaman that kioga
the snow hawk is gone away in disgrace
these many long months

  i know everything that has hap-
pened or will happen returned the
masked one sharply as if in rebuke

  then demanded the irrepressible
brave elk as was his right according to
shoni custom fjive us some sign of
your great medicine

  the masquerader turned slowly rivet-
ing the speaker with a steady stare
through the slits in the mask then he
spoke gutturally and with emphasis de-
signed to awe the man and others who
had gathered to hear the oracle speak
naught of importance has happened
lately so you have said but i tell you
that before the moon has risen the tor-
ture-fires will be kindled the cries of
your victims will wake the forest and
beware-i repeat beware-lest the snow
hawk fly into your midst-for of such a
thing my omens have spoken hat-ya
with that he wheeled and mingled
with a band of tall and dignified warriors
stalking about the village muffled in
beautiful skin blankets and crowned with
fillets of handsome feathers indicative
of their deeds and ofiice everywhere
he went a way was cleared for him

soon the jaws of the sentries dropped
for it came to pass as ravens tail
had foretold a hail from the river was
heard sentries manned the walls to
scan the waters whence it came then
fierce and shrill aboe the mounting
noises in the village came the blood-
thirsty cry aif ntaea tui chokal
prisoners for the state sacrifice for
the sacred fire

  all other pursuits were put aside the
populace crowded eagerly toward the
gate to view those destined as sport for
the licking flames foremost among the
villagers was a figure in robe mask and
blanket



  the great gates swung apart flanked
by their burly captors the indians of
kiogas band came wearily in blood-
stained and disheveled all who lived
were there grass girl with her babe
mourned moons son whose scalp
adorned the belt of a shoni at her side
the others glanced hopelessly about
stunned by the size of the village and
the fierce expressions of its inhabitants
little tokala shrank back fearfully from
the masked face grinning down on him
as he was pushed along

but the frightful creature followed
as tokala learned by frequently look-
ing back over a shoulder-followed and
noted where the captives were imprisoned
and the position of their guards he ob-
served that they were given food and
drink and that would-be molesters were
driven off but at last to tokalas in-
tense relief the shaman went away

  having heard a mutter of drums on
the ceremonial grounds kioga knew that
the prisoners would be safe at least un-
til the winter festival was over a mat-
ter of many hours in which time much
could happen and so he proceeded to-
ward where the drums had begun to roll
and took up a position behind and to
one side of the great assemblage now
and then a passing warrior greeted him
-sometimes with hostile bearing but
none questioned his identity

  swiftly the keen eye of the snow
hawk darted among them all seeking a
glimpse of noble kias friend of his boy-
hood-tall lean powerful kias who had
fought at his side in the battle at the
painted cliffs where under the snow-
hawks leadership the shoni tribes had
turned back the raiding wa-kanek for
the first time in the memory of living
men nowhere could kioga distinguish
that familiar figure

  but among the chiefs regnant sat me-
newa beloved of his people in the
tugari tribe whom kioga recognized in-
stantly then his eager glance cast
about for a glimpse of one he would
never forget-heladi daughter of me-
newa she who had brought his fierce
wild life its one interval of peace and
calm-and a love which he had denied
with unwitting callousness heladi was
nowhere to be seen had she met the
sudden death of the raiders knife or
fallen into the clutches of a tiger when
bearing water into the village 

with ever-incrsasing power thi fascinating story of th snow hawk
and the far wilci land of natowa continues in our forthcoming june issue
no flame more fierce

it was no popgun south american revolution these tourists
from the states walked into but an ugly business of blood
and fire  a powerful story by the author of the
pirates beard and the rebellion of smell fry

captain van oot came down
late to dinner his face was seri-
ous a noticeable and unusual thing
for that rather jolly personage he stood
at his place for a moment and then said
in a voice loud enough to break through
the conversation of the ten passengers
well well make san lucas early
tomorrow morning

  mr denhams voice answered for all
the others

okay captain    what time do we
get through with the port authorities
probably about nine-thirty or so but
there is something i want to say to you

i	have a radiogram fro  the company
office at san lucas saying there- is a
revolution in colivuela it may affect
your plans

  hell no said mr denham theres
always a popgun revolution in these
little spig countries that wont bother
us will it folks after all were ameri-
can citizens

  there was a general buzz of approval
on the part of the other passengers the
two professors both a little the worse-
or better-for good mellow dutch gin
lifted their wine-glasses

  heres to the revolution  toasted
professor hastings

  bigger and better revolutions
toasted professor mayhew

  and all the others even quiet dumpy
mrs chaler and pretty doll-like little
miss brewster responded to the toasts
even the german couple who scarcely
knew what it was about raised their
glasses and so did maxie stein who
didnt care about revolutions as long as
he could get to curagao and buy up
those perfumes at bargain prices they
were a gay crowd the zaraza was a
passenger-carrying freighter of the royal
dutch line and in the memory of no
officer had there ever been such a joyous
crowd

  but there was one passenger who didnt
drink to that toast he didnt drink at

  all he never ordered wine never ac-
  cepted any of the gins that the denhams
  and the gay professors kept offering
  everybody his name was knowles and
  that was about all anyone knew of him
  he was tall and thin and white and tired-
  looking he wore brown sun-glasses to
  shield his eyes you could see pretty
  plainly that he wasnt a good mixer he
  spent most of his time alone quietly
  reading heavy-looking books and when
  captain van oot announced the revolu-
  tion it was pretty plain that mr
  knowles was worried about it sitting
  next to the capta n he was seen by the
  others to ask serious questions in a low
  tone

    mr denham nudged maxie stein and
  pointed this out to him with a wink
  everybody at the denhams table looked
  and grinned and nodded to each other
  there are always people like that-just
  natural-born sissies timorous little people
  who are afraid of everything probably
  mr knowles was a bookkeeper or a
  little clerk you could practically tell
  by his dark glasses probably this cruise
  was the greatest adventure of his retreat-
  ing and uneventful life

    and when dinner was over and the
  passengers had piled up on the deck to
  have their coffee and rum mr knowles
  stayed below still conversing seriously
  with the captain and the first officer

   said mr denham to mrs denham
  loud enough for all the rest to hear and
  get a laugh out of it

    well the revolution seems to panic
  our friend mr milktoast doesnt it its
  a wonder that bird ever dares to cross
  the hudson on a ferry-boat

   they all thought that crack was
  pretty funny

  the zaraza made the harbor at san
  lucas just be ore sunrise she was
  warped into the dock toward seven
  oclock over the flat top of the dock-
  sheds mr knowles could see the town

 rising up in terraces cf streets crawling
 up the side of the mountains as though
 the city feared the very cleanliness of
 the sea he had risen with the sun and
 had stationed himself on the freight
 deck forward in the very prow of the
 ship strange sounds catcalls shout-
 ings screaming of windlasses puffing of
 donkey engines broke into his thinking
 crowds of scantily clad little brown
 people were milling about the pier and
 swarming over the railroad sidings
 officials clambered aboard they had
 much brass on their soiled white uni-
 forms their skin was dirty brown
 sometimes a chalky gray they sat in
 the dining-salon and talked rapidly with
 tha captain in guttural spanish mr
 knowles listened to them through the
 doorway as he listened he grew even
 paler than usual

 at breakfast blue identity-cards were
   l issued to all passengers

   we want to get a car and drive up to
 the capital to watch the fun announced
 mr denham again spokesman for the
 others i suppose he company can
 arrange that for us

   captain van oot frowned

   i doubt if theyll let you go through
 he said there may be serious trouble
 you know

   oh we dont care said mrs den-
 ham after all we are american citi-
 zens they wouldnt dare to touch us
 tell your office here we want a seven-
 passenger car it will be all right

   the captain merely smiled and said
 very well madam im sure theyll try
 to arrange it

  as everyone expected mr knowles
 did not go ashore with the ethers irre-
 pressible maxie stein called out to him
 as they went down the gangplank

   hey knowles dont be a sissy all
 your life cmon and see the fireworks
 little esther here needs a boy friend to
 protect her



i must say i dont like this crowd
said professor hastings

no flame more fierce



it was useless to scream now 

the man had lost the fleeing crowd

no there was one man running be-
hind them then there was an ex-
plosion her carrier stopped short
and relaxed his hold

  little esther was miss esther brew-
ster and everybody thought that maxies
wisecrack was funny especially because
mr knowles had attempted to talk with
her one evening about the difference be-
tween the stars you can see in the
southern sky and those in the northern
sky and miss brewster had been bored
and excused herself this morning miss
brewster was quite sparkling she had
turquoise shorts on and a bright carmine
blouse she made a vivid spot of color
going down the gangplank and all the
natives standing around grinned and
leered

  mr knowles called out to her ignor-
ing maxie

 i wouldnt wear that costume here
if i were you miss brewster

  no i guess you wouldnt she re-
plied laughingly and that was pretty
funny too

 when the other passengers had van-
ished down the crooked streets of san

lucas mr knowles went back to his
cabin he fumbled in his bag and
pulled out a dirty wrinkled suit of white
duck and an old battered rolled-up
panama these he put on apparently
not caring how seedy and un-american
he looked then he fumbled again in
his bag and brought out a curious little
camera it was a german gadget that
looked like a small clumsy pistol but it
had a  lens and a battery of twenty
tiny plates three centimeters square
again from the bag he pulled a short auto-
matic and shoved it into his hip pocket
imagine a sissy with a gun like that
mr denham and maxie stein would
have got a big laugh out of that and
when mr knowles stepped out of his
cabin it was noticeable that he had neg-
lected to put on shoes and socks and in
his bare feet and dirty clothes with a
cigarette dangling from his mouth he
looked more like a bedraggled native of
san lucas or a forgotten white man


the blue book magazine

who had gone wrong and was on the
beach as they say

  he grinned at the captain and made
his way to the radio cabin there he
had quite a conversation with sparks
the operator who was a bright young
dutchman and who seemed to be a little
excited then mr knowles clambered
to the freight deck pattered down the
gangplank waved at the captain who
was standing there and vanished in the
press of endless crowds of brown people

  think hell get back  asked the
first officer of the captain

  god knows i hope so replied the
captain i have no authority to stop
him but i wish he had taken another
ship

  h-m-m-m said the first officer
well this ruins his vacation   

  meanwhile the little parade of tour-
ists had reached the offices of the royal
dutch line miss brewster had found
it more comfortable to walk between the
two professors she had found that the
dirty little brown people had noticed her
bright costume so unusual in that coun-
try and especially had they noticed her
undeniably attractive legs she didnt
like the faces of these people they
were leering drawn unwholesome-look-
ing people as she passed one knot of
them a leering black man whose trousers
if they could be called such were scarce-
ly sufficient to cover him with modesty
made a gesture in her direction she
didnt exactly understand the gesture nor
his loud remark in some strange guttural
language but she knew it wasnt very
nice the whole crowd around him
laughed loudly and nastily   

the officials of the company were
courteous but a car to take them
to the capital-ah that would be diffi-
cult the road was dangerous there was
fighting yes people had been killed
the government was doing its best of
course but the people were out of hand
yes they would telephone to the state
department yes they would phone the
american consul-general yes indeed
they would do everything in their power
but it was very doubtful if they could
arrange a safe-conduct nothing to do
but wait unfortunately

 said mr denham

  why this is absurd we are all
american citizens we have the protec-
tion of the united states they wouldnt
dare to touch us where would colivu-
elabe without the united states look

what our development companies have
done for them why we have given
them their very bread-

  the dutch official looked queerly at
mr denham had he been familiar with
american slang he might have used the
expression oh yeah but he contented
himself with a pcssibly more subtle ob-
servation

  i think mr denham that the less
you say about american companies just
now the batter everything will be

  why the very idea  exclaimed mrs
denham

  especially in this office-if vou dont
mind as i have said we will do all in
our power to get you through to the
capital but it must be understood that
we assume no responsibility at all you
go there at your own risk

  okay mister agreed maxie stein
arrogantly just get us the car thats
all we want

so they waited bored uncomfortable
hot-and thirsty the two profes-
sors especially had a thirst they slipped
quietly toward the office door miss
brewster who wes a little bored with
the others joined them suddenly the
three pushed their way through hundreds
of dirty half-clad natives who gave way
before them grudgingly the street was
very narrow the houses were blue or
red or green or pastel shades and seemed
to be leaning on each others shoulders
to keep from slid ng down the hillside
into the ocean at every intersection
there seemed to be more people swarm-
ing into the street

  they could however see a large-if
rather battered arid dirty-sign at the
bottom of the hill which read el tura-
quil and then carried the bold english
inscription cold beer that was their
destination

  i must say i dont like this crowd
said professor hastings

  nor i agreec professor mayhew
filthy little people arent they he
had not lowered his voice when he said
this and it became evident that one of
the filthy little people had understood
his uncomplimentary remark for a lean
brown hand reached out and pushed him
rudely

 peeg peeg of americano why
you come here eef you no like thees
place and the ratty-faced little man
stuck his thumb behind his teeth and
pulled it out at the professor in a most
insulting gesture then he cried out
no flame more fierce



  something in some indian dialect and
  the entire crowd broke into catcalls and
  loud unpleasant noises evidently di-
  rected at the three americans

   it was not comfortable they were
 jostled and pushed hands were laid on
 miss brewster who could only shrug
 them off and cling closely to professor
 mayhew professor hastings who was
 a large man and had seen powerful in
 his day bristled and would have used
 violence but mayhew hastily warned
 him off

   easy george he said dont do
 anything were almost at the cafe now
 keep close to miss brewster here and
 hold yourself in you might start some-
 thing you couldnt finish

    good sound advice

 at the foot of the hill the street
 i widened into a broad plaza the
 cafe el turaquil faced this plaza there
 were hundreds perhaps thousands of
 natives milling about in this plaza shout-
 - ing frenetically the three tourists hur-
 ried across to the cafe and pushed
 through the screen doors the voices of
 those who had been screaming at them
 were drowned in the hubbub of the
 thronging plaza nor did their perse-
 cutors follow them inside the excite-
 ment of the mob appeared to have been
 too much for them

    alio pliz said a f it greasy woman
  from across the bar you weesh one
  goddam good rum brugal yes  one dol-
  lar so cheap for you yes

    no madam insisted professor hast-
  ings we want beer cold beer
  beer yes she ees cold for one
  dol-far so cheap

   too much money we dont want to
 buy your bar we ony want a drink
 professor mayhew had said this and he
 had said it bluntly flatly and with the
 frown of dignity he was not going to
 be fleeced by these people

    i say one dol-lar you no like you
  go away said the patrona then she
  turned to a small group of men who were
  drinking at the bar and addressed them
  in spluttering spanish almost as one
  they turned and looked at the three
  americans almost a one they spoke
  in voluminous spanish with proper ges-
  ticulations what they said was not
  understood but it was obvious that they
  considered the fat lady was justified in
  demanding one dol-lar for the beer
  and that a refusal was an insult possibly
  to the whole nation

  come on lets go said professor
mayhew

  oh yes lets said miss brewster
and the three turned toward the door

  hardly had they reached the door-sill
when bedlam broke out behind them
the fat patrona the clients-everyone in
the el turaquil bar-began screaming
the cries were taken up outside groups
broke away from the mob in the plaza
and turned their attention to the three
americans waving their arms making
obscene gestures they began crowding
close they began reaching with their
hands they began jostling and push-
ing and pawing the two professors and
the frightened miss brewster and then
george hastings professor of middle
english at midwestern lost his temper
just as a scrawny little brown man his
face working and twitching with inex-
plicable rage reached out to clutch the
thin silk of miss brewsters blouse pro-
fessor hastings drove a strong left into
the natives face he whirled and
smacked another with his right he
roared like a bull unmindful of the dig-
nity of his phd degree

  come on you damned niggers come
on you black scum   and other more
violent expletives which he had not used
these fifteen or twenty years

  there was a pause hastings though
not young was a big man and looked
dangerous but the native who had
fallen under the professors left was
writhing into a crawling position a long
knife in his hand miss brewster saw it
and screamed

  professor mayhew kicked violently at
the fist that held the knife and the blade
clattered other knives flashed miss
brewster was sure that their last minute
had come hastings had torn off his
coat and was roaring at them gone
berserk with righteous anger

  then suddenly it happened

from across the plaza there sounded
a sharp spluttering there were terri-
fied and agonized screams the splutter-
ing was transformed into a long-drawn
sardonic chattering machine-guns glass
broke behind the scared little group of
tourists there were screams inside the
cafe

  on the ground cried mayhew and
threw himself flat the others followed
suit

  chatter-chatter-chatter the mob
howled and broke in terror the door of
the cafe slammed and in just a few


the blue book magazine

seconds the plaza was emptying in ter-
rible confusion

  when the two professors were able to
clear their minds and to concentrate
they found themselves surrounded by
little men in khaki uniforms one of
these apparently an officer was speak-
ing rapidly in spanish hastings stood
erect very dirty and dusty he pointed
to mayhew who was just getting to his
feet and said

  americanos we americanos

  but even as he said this it came to
him that his party was no longer com-
plete

  my god charley he cried wheres
the girl 

  shes gone   echoed charles may-
hew phd

  then the officer in broken english
was apologizing was explaining was
taking them by the arm and leading them
away useless to try and explain about
miss brewster he understood nothing
firmly if gently they were led from the
square a small detachment of troops
was thrown around them and still re-
sisting still protesting still trying to re-
member the spanish word for woman
still bewildered at miss brewsters dis-
appearance they were led back across
the railroad tracks to the docks and es-
corted to the very gangplank of the
zaraza whether they liked it or not

  at the gangplank was a port officer
who did understand english both at
once they told about miss brewster
the officer seemed only slightly dis-
turbed

  very unfortunate he said but
there is no cause to worry within one
hour there will be no revolutionaries
alive in san lucas miss brewster will
come to no harm you may be sure
this fact he believed and he instructed
the men to look for the young lady

during the shooting on the ground
with faces buried in their arms the
professors had not seen a pair of brown
hands snatch miss brewster up the
cries of the multitude had drowned her
scream for help they had not seen her
in the arms of a tall fellow being car-
ried quickly up the threadlike street that
runs up toward the mountains actually
winding its way to a market-place just
outside the town

  miss brewsters scream was paralyzed
by her sudden panic she felt the great
strength of her captor the power of his
legs as he ran with her she could not

see his face but she could see his feet as
her head dangled over his shoulder she
had noticed that he wore shoes and that
she observed was unusual in san lucas
it was useless to struggle useless to
scream now the man was clutching her
legs and straining as he ran he ducked
into a narrow alley crossed a tiny court-
yard and down into another narrow
street miss brewster noted vaguely that
he had lost the fleeing crowd no
there was dhe man running behind them
-a tall lean fellow in a dirty panama
and dusty bare feet she could still hear
the chatter of machine-guns

then right behind her was an ex-
plosion her carrier stopped short
he relaxed his hold and she slipped to
the ground

  running steps pattered a voice
snapped in crackling spanish her cap-
tor clutching his shoulder stood para-
lyzed murmuring santa madre de
dios-

  she sat there bewildered she saw a
tall lean man in filthy whites running
and flourishing an automatic his face
was rather haggard but his eyes
twinkled	

  okay sister lie said in clear english
sit tight while i frisk this bird

  miss brewster scarcely heard him she
saw bare feet covered with dust his
thin white lean face was besmudged and
streaked with dirt she heard the same
crisp voice again in spanish more quiet-
ly this time a litt le ironically

  hagame el javor de tener llevados los
manos senor and the natives hands
reached for the sky above him

  this curious fellow grinned at miss
brewster then covering him- with his
automatic he walked over to the brown
native and felt his jacket he removed
a revolver from cne pocket and a long
knife from his bel

  una costumbre americana senor he
said quietly an old american custom

  then he jerked his thumb in the di-
rection of the back street with obvious
significance the man hesitated then
slouched away finally breaking into a
run

  what the hell did you wear that
damned-fool costume for sister where
in hell do you think you are-palm
beach

  miss brewster thought his voice was
strangely american strangely familiar
she replied a little weakly

  i guess i was istupid-
no flame more fierce



           amid howled imprecations the dignified elderly cavaldos was spat
           upon dragged to the car and lashed by his legs to the rear axle


the blue book magazine

  dumb sister dumb if i hadnt seen
you and your crowd down there in the
square youd be waiting for your ship to
buy you back again as soon as the fight
is over

  really

  yeah really said this rude and dirty
thin man

  you mean he would have held me for
ransom

  you get it sister now take off that
damned rig-out and get into my pants

  but-i cant ive nothing on

  jesus  forget your damned modesty
youre in a jam snappy now

  as he spoke he undid his belt letting
his trousers drop to the ground then
he peeled off his loose dirty jacket and
stood before her practically naked save
for a pair of shorts in a daze miss
brewster pulled on the trousers he held
out to her and wrapped herself in his
white jacket

  roll em up fix em any way just
sos you can run now grab this hat and
run sister

  he pulled off his battered panama and
revealed a head of close-cropped straight
blond hair dirt covered his features
but there was something about him-
what was it

miss brewster allowed him to
pull his hat over her head it fitted
more or less he held her off at arms-
length peering at her

  youll do you look like the devil
but youll get away with it now you
run like hell down that street see you
take the first turn to the left and run to
the next street you turn right there
and keep on running until you get to the
docks youll find your boat at pier
five about two hundred yards down the
shore climb aboard and stay there
youll just make it before hell breaks
loose here now run

  miss brewster stood still

  oh i cant tell you how thankful i
am-

  nuts lady shove off run get to
hell out of here

  she ran

  he watched her disappear he stood
there and grinned a little

  poor little sap he said in english
and then he too turned and ran quickly
in another direction

  naked save for his shorts the lean
man ran toward the center of town he
stopped only long enough to rub hand-
fuls of dirt over his sweaty body he

tucked his automatic into the binding of
his shorts but in his hand he carried a
tiny camera that looked like a small
pistol

  there was noise ahead of him there
was the sound of shooting there were
screams and the roaring of a multitude
there was the chatter of machine-guns
and the slow crack-crack of a heavier
piece or possibly several from the
direction of the harbor

the american development company
offices at san lucas are impressive-
were impressive is more accurate they
were built of imported tile bricks and
contained two elevators and they gave
on the broad square in front of the
market-place president alvardo for
twenty-five years chief executive of the
country and all-powerful dictator of the
land had cleared a fortune of two billion
bolivars or about sixty million dollars
amassed enough pcwer to keep him with-
out rival as a perpetual president who
by use of torture armed forces and
bribery could even dispense with elec-
tions and had built a structure of frank
undisguised racketeering that made a
capone and his crew seem like a bunch
of pikers-all through arrangements
with american companies but in de-
cember the president had died on that
day also died the structure of his power
and the next day-the actual day of
which we write-all the stifled tortured
starving groaning populace of the
country broke out like an overwhelming
tide destroying every vestige of the re-
gime which had brought them such suf-
fering on that day the symbol of
alvardo treachery-the building of the
american development concession-wras
torn stone from stone brick from brick

  there was madness in the square the
lean man felt it as he approached like
stalks of corn laid by a storm bodies
were strewn on the cobbles some were
still writhing here and there was a
severed arm or leg or even a bloodied
head shorn by insane machetes wielded
by blood-mad peons puffs of smoke
sharp explosions from down by the bay
were followed by little pellets of death in
the square as the former presidents
yacht-now a temporary gunboat-fired
small shells into the mob but the
maddened swirl of brown men ignored
them

  in his muddied shorts naked from
waist to head streaked with dirt grimy
of foot the lean man was unnoticeable
no flame more fierce



in the seething mob his gun clung
against his stomach tight in the band of
his shorts his little camera was clasped
in his hand he pressed forward with
the mob shouting their cries calling their
calls pretending to sing their weird
chants of half-savage defiance and tri-
umph

  forward he pressed into a tightly
massed knot across from the cathedral
a huge telephone-pole weighing perhaps
a ton was being lifted and swung by
hundreds of brown hands the lean
mans camera clicked

  uno t

 the mob about them took up the
count

  dos

  the wielders of the pole swung back
on their feet braced themselves

  tres i

 one hundred legs swung into mo-
tion in a crescendo of speed the very
momentum of the poles weight threw
them forward faster and faster twenty
fifty a hundred feet then with a sound
of a ripping tearing explosion the bat-
tering ram crashed into the brick wall of
the development company building shat-
tering it tearing a vast hole in it little
mad brown men armed with axes and
sledges and machetes poured into the
breach a few scattered shots sounded
inside then screams windows crashed
live bodies were hurled to the pavement
from two or three stories above to be
trampled under the feet of the mob in
ten minutes the building was a shambles
 there is no flame more fierce than the
anger of a downtrodden people betrayed

five times the lean mans tiny
camera had clicked-five impressions
of mob-madness registered on miniscule
glass squares

  the scream of a klaxon horn sounded

  ai automobile roared into the square
carrying the red flag of revolt the
crowd gave way before it- a man in
tropical garb stood tp in the tonneau
and bellowed at the crowd waving his
arms the lean man listened to the
crackling spanish

  people of colivuela men of san
lucas the capital is taken the
garrison has surrendered the body of
the oppressor alvardo has been dragged
through the city streets i have a radio
message of the compete success of the
revolution sevellas governor has fled
the people rule the city puerto cabezas
is ours four gunboats seized by our men

are on their way to san lucas to de-
stroy the odious yacht of the oppressor
which is in this harbor the day of free-
dom has dawned for us the spirit of
bolivar is leading us to victory

 the speaker was the man who had
kidnaped little miss brewster  the lean
man wondered whose automobile he had
stolen things happen rapidly in those
hot febrile countries a prisoner yester-
day a petty thief and would-be kidnaper
half an hour before a public messenger
now    he might be president dic-
tator or even emperor tomorrow

the little camera clicked once more
you men of colivuela you trodden
men who have felt the sting of alvardos
whips whose limbs have been crushed in
his torture machines-

  the sonorous voice chanted on

  -let us destroy the friends of the op-
pressor let us break their houses as
you have broken this building symbol of
his betrayal

  the mob roared

down the broad avenue that reaches
the length of the town far down the
vista of palm trees came another scream-
ing sound of a klaxon a big american-
made truck was tearing toward the
square clusters of brown people packed
the truck fairly dangling from its sides
brakes screamed the truck skidded to
a halt was swallowed by the masses the
lean man could see four white people
huddling together in it hundreds of
hands snatched them to the pavement
one an elderly man with a dignified
white van dyke and mustachios now
tinged with red blood was dragged
to the center of the mob amid howled
imprecations

  the lean man recognized that face
he had seen it in the newspapers it
was jose-maria de cavaldos long min-
ister of state under the alvardo regime
he uttered no protest he was spat up-
on dirt and filth were thrown upon
him hands dragged him to the car
he was thrown to the ground lashed by
his legs to the rear axle and the car
motor roaring venomously dragged that
bruised aged body around the square
while the multitude screamed its mad-
dened approval

  the lean mans camera clicked again
he pushed his way toward the truck
two young men and a girl were standing
beside it hemmed in by sweaty ragged
brown natives they had agory in their
faces they watched their fathers slow


no flame more fierce

tortured death dazed and unable to be-
lieve the lean man worked his way
close to them as he reached their guard
the automobile of the mob leader had
stopped and the crowd all together
surged forward to seize the limp lifeless
form of cavaldos from the dust they
tore it loose from its lashings and car-
ried it to the cathedral they strung it
up and left it dangling heal downward
from a grotesque gargoyle that overhung
the great portal while th crowd yelled
insanely

 even the guard around the young
prisoners yelled their mad joy at this
spectacle at this instant the lean man
thrust his automatic into the hand of the
taller of the two young men whispering
rapidly to him in spanish

your one chance the ship zaraza
sails in an hour make it if you can
then clicking his camera once more
he slipped away down a side street and
was lost

six bells on the zaraza dinner-time
the dining-salon was bustling with
conversation

  really ive never been so rudely
treated in my life mrs denham was
saying it was bad enough not to get
us a car for the capital-but to force us
to stay in that stuffy office for two solid
hours

  i shall certainly make a written com-
plaint to the company in new york as
soon as we get home said mr denham
furthermore i shall write to the state
department about the way we were
treated as an american citizen i have
a right to full protection we all have
imagine miss brewster being treated
like this revolution or no revolution 
said professor hastings

  i never saw such dirty mean little
people if the authorities hadnt started
shooting just then we might have gotten
into serious trouble all because they
wanted to make us pay a dollar for a
bottle of beer too

  said professor mayhew

  well probably send a detachment of
marines down here to protect the ameri-
can investments

  said miss brewster

  i can tell you i was frightened i
wonder where that fellow who rescued
me learned his english he swore dread-
fully at me too and was i embar-
rassed when he made me get into his
clothes of all the experiences 

  just then mr knowles came into the
saloon together with the radio operator
he was dressed in his worn-looking
tweeds he was if possible paler than
ever his brown sun glasses gave him
the most stupid kind of an expression
said maxie ste n

  howdy knowles now suppose you
tell us your experiences ill bet you
didnt even go ashore to see the fun
come on now lets have it

  there was a general grin at the tables
mr knowles spoke hesitatingly
well he said i did go ashore i
got some of the loveliest postage stamps
theyre really beautiful you know and
im a collector but i thought perhaps
it wasnt very safe to go farther than the
post office

  postage stamps the passengers even
the german couple nearly collapsed with
laughter at that captain van oot
winked at the first officer and they
both looked amused mr knowles
lowered himself into his seat and timidly
asked for the muffins   

  at exactly that same hour in new
york in the city room of the largest
news syndicate in america there was
great excitement

  editor jay barbour his hands full of
flimsies a foot long was shouting to
acting city editor bill brandt

  good lord bill what a scoop old
spig knowles stepped right into the
middle of that colivuelan mess first-
person story-eyewitness three col-
umns and a running feature good for five
days my god bey its the best break
of the year look at that 

  brandt snatched the flimsies

  saw em drag old cavaldos body
around the street-

  yeah and he personally rescued ca-
valdos kids-got em on the freighter
with him got their personal stories hid
em in steerage

  yeah and he says hes got fifteen
photos sending rninny plates by air-
mail from curasao boy its a wow
poor old knowles commented edi-
tor barbour reflectively that makes
a hell of a vacation cruise for him
doesnt it though agreed brandt
but it feeds us with material for that
development company campaign

  and the zaraza steamed quietly on
with its cruise under the bright silent
calm starry skies of the south carrying
city editor knowles to the end of his
calm restful vacation

a lively tale of tiny david
and the state police

by robert r mill

captain field the commanding
officer of the black horse troop
of the new york state police
drew a heavy line on a crude map

  here is the canadian border
right the word of assent came
from lieutenant edward david who
stood peering oyer one of the shoulders
of the troop captain

  and here continued captain field
making a dot north of the line is the
probable location of the loading station
this assertion was greeted with a pro-
found nod from lieutenant james crosby
resplendent in the new uniform that de-
noted his advanced station in life who
stood behind the other shoultler

  according to my information cap-
tain field went on the car will cross
the border on a dirt road use the main
road to plazy and then swing to the east
on a dirt road coming out on the main
road again south of plantville he
drew the route on the map and indi-
cated a spot on the dirt road that
should be the best spot to knock off the
car

  hear what they are running sir
asked lieutenant crosby

  opium answered captain field
gum opium worth enough to pay the
salaries of two lieutenants for about
twenty years and speaking of lieu-
tenants it is about time several of them
did something to earn their salaries so
it might be well not to have any slips on
this action and not excuses is what
we want tonight

  mr crosby remained discreetly silent
lieutenant tiny david however had
his usual objections to any plan that in-
volved work and responsibility

  i dont know that country very well
he began

  neither do i crosby admitted
captain fields silence was ominous
but david ignored it

  raining now be black as pitch to-
night how are we to find that particu-
lar spot on the dirt road

  captain field added some detail to
the map

  two miles south of plazy he as-
serted you have an odometer on your
car it is that dial with a lot of figures
on it and a needle ill get one of the
men in the garage to explain it to you
tiny david sighed with resignation




the blue book magazine

illustrated by
monte crews

the wanted car was
speeding on its merry
way along a road that
ran parallel to the
one upon which he
troopers were sta-
tioned-and a good
hundred yards away

  yes sir he agreed despondently
according to my information cap-
tain field continued the car will start
south about midnight but you better be
set some time before that

  mr david with faultless logic had
discovered the only loophole

  maybe he offered hopefully the
information is phony maybe the car
wont make the run tonight maybe
they gave us the tip to pull the patrols
over there so they can shoot the car
through another way maybe-
maybe youll be with us tomorrow
interrupted captain field but i doubt
it you wont be if you come in with-
out that car and that goes for you too
crosby

  they nodded gloomily folded up the
map and departed

the evening was young when the
troop-car pulled away from the bar-
racks mr david a picture of pessi-
mism was driving mr crosby with a
face that would have done credit to an

undertaker sat beside him the back
seat was held down effectively by ser-
geants henry linton and john king who
protested against the weather the com-
pany the nature of the errand and
sundry other thin-js

  plazy is east of the barracks the car
headed west

  thought we were going to plazy de-
murred air linton

  there was no answer from the front
seat

  probably going via rochester sug-
gested mr king only takes us about
seven hundred miles out of our way

  this also went unanswered

  guess he doesnt speak english
linton decided well he hasnt been
in this country very long

  the rain was accompanied by a stiff
wind which sen the drops stinging
against their faces they drew their
oilskins about them and huddled to-
gether for warmth

  they were twenty miles away from
the barracks and the same mileage had
head

been added to the distance from plazy
when the car came to a halt

  hop out lieutenant david ordered
the occupants of the rear seat hop
out and give a convincing imitation of
doing a lot of work make plenty of
noise about it yell to jim and me
occasionally so the customers will get
the idea there are a lot of us he
pointed at approaching headlights here
comes some business now

  sergeants linton and king flagged the
car the driver apparently shared their
thoughts regarding the procedure he
was returning from a vacation in canada
and he was anxious to get back to his
loft in the garment-trade section

  this he remonstrated is a fine
pizness a texpayer gets stopped by
dressed-up loafers what he pays and i
am esking you how vis i to know that
you aint two of these bandit-bums
sergeant linton examined registration
card and drivers license in the glow from
his flashlight

  the driver appealed to his wife on the
rear seat

  rachel look at the dressed-up loaf-
ers raincoats yet what the texpayers
pay for and we should pay for-
hush morris came the counsel
from the rear

  it was disregarded the silence of the
two troopers gave the driver courage
the tirade became personal abuse it
was punctuated with profanity

  hush morris

  a small boy sitting beside his mother
raised a plaintive wail

but the driver continued the abuse
having exhausted the defects of the
two men he turned his attention to their
families and it was then that lintons
temper already under considerable
strain flared up

  his hand grasped the driver by the
collar and raised him from the seat

  oy came the shrill cry from the
boy he steal da poppa

  a guffaw from sergeant king caused
linton to relax his hold his anger gave
way to amusement the driver shared
that amusement

  sorry linton muttered but you
should be glad to see us out here on a
night like this

  thats right the driver admitted
it makes safeness from them bandit fel-
lows look rachel at the nice officers
sergeant king chuckled

  go ahead he ordered

work	

  their succeeding customers were a
boy and a girl on their way to a dance
a gentleman barely on the safe side of
being an intoxicated driver a lady to
whom the ordeal could not have been
very trying for she suggested prolong-
ing it at her home near by from which
her husband would be absent for some
hours a gentleman of color who pro-
tested because you-all never does take
no black boys in your outfit does you
and a farmer returning from market

now tiny david called a halt to the
proceedings

  get in he ordered

  linton gazed at him sadly

  tiny-he called his superior officer
by the nickname-there are times when
i think you arent quite right in the head
other times i am sure of it this is one
of those times

lieutenant david deigned to explain
word travels fast sometimes want
word to get around that a lot of us are
working in this neck of the woods now
well beat it for plazy

  lieutenant crosby turned half around
to add a footnote

  sergeants he declared with heavy
dignity dont think of little things like
that lieutenants do thats why they
are lieutenants

  mr linton snorted loudly

  the only thing you have done so far
is sit if we had a sandbag in your
place the car would ride better he
appealed to his companion what is
the trade-in value on a new lieutenant
jack

  mr king pondered

  the only thing you can figure on
he declared is the nuisance value

  the long drive was enlivened by a
two-mouthed discussion during which
messrs linton and king weighed the
qualifications of crosby for the position
he held commented freely on his con-
duct since assuming that office speculat-
ed at length upon his probable tenure
of office and after differing on several
minor issues they agreed that captain
field must have been in a state closely
akin to senile decay when he recom-
mended crosby for a commission that
the few human qualities crosby ever
possessed had departed upon his pro-
motion and that the first of the month
-then eight days distant--would find
him again a sergeant or-this was more
probable-no longer a member of the
rlack horse troop


the blue book magazine

  all this was settled to the satisfaction
of the rear seat only when the lights of
plazy appeared in the distance tiny
david was guiding the car around the
village when crosby made his first
contribution

  naturally you boys will want to be
around to watch your prophecies come
true when i make out the stable-list
monday ill see that you both are on it
nobody can say i forget old friends
the purr of the motor the rattle of
the rain the whistle of the wind but no
conversation from the rear seat featured
the progress of the car as tiny david
headed south on the dirt road two
miles beyond the village he stopped

  black as a lieutenants heart de-
clared crosby

it was indeed dark an inky blackness
that made the trees on both sides of
the road indistinguishable daubs

  no lights warned tiny david who
had switched off the headlights

  they groped about in the dark until
they found a patch of smooth grass at
the side of the road upon which they
backed the troop-car which was headed
south

  now we will get organized tiny
david declared king you stay in the
car keep the motor running linny
feel your way about three hundred feet
back on this road sing out when you
are in position jim you get set about
two hundred feet this side of linny
ill be here not far from the car

  he added a warning

  this is strange country to all of us
when you get to your station paw
around and make sure you are on solid
ground

  they voiced their assent

  when and if the car appears tiny
david continued linton will flag it
it is a safe bet they wont stop take
to the ditch in plenty of time jim you
get next smack at it remember where
the ditch is you probably will need it
i bat next and if there is any shooting
to be done ill do it understand
they admitted they did

  if you have to jump follow regular
procedure pick yourself up and run
to the chase-car so we can get after them
quickly and one more thing hug the
shadows so his headlights wont pick you
up in time for him to turn around and
beat it back where he came from guess
thats all but dont try to think ill
do that for the party

  they started out for their stations
making pertinent remarks regarding
northern new york weather

  okay came the call from linton
crosby repeated it

  right shouted tiny david

  they stood silently at their several
positions straining forward in an effort
to pierce the gloom their eyes found
nothing to relieve the blackness traffic
upon the dirt road was non-existent

  an hour passed it seemed an age
over his shoulder tiny david could hear
the low purr of the motor as it turned
over at idling speed all other noises
were contributed by nature and as the
night dragged along the temperature
dropped they pulled the collars of
their oilskins abaut their necksy and
longed for their sheepskins

  then so low that it was hardly
audible there came a whining noise from
the north it grew in volume soon it
was possible to distinguish it as the
noise of a motor being driven at top
speed the engine of the troop-car sput-
tered and then settled into a monotonous
hum as sergeant king speeded it up
preparatory to the expected chase

  three men separated from each other
by spaces of inky darkness went through
motions that were almost identical they
tightened their gun-belts the left
hand of each man was thrust into the
pocket of his oilskins from which it
emerged clasping a flashlight then
with muscles tense they waited

  the whine of the approaching motor
became a roar the car was hidden
from them by a hill the top of which
veiled by the darkness loomed before
them

  there was no doubt in their minds
but that this was their quarry the
reckless speed at which the approaching
car was being driven argued that its
occupants were on an illegitimate er-
rand their very presence on this out-
of-the-way road screamed aloud the fact
that something was amiss

the hearts of the troopers beat a little
faster forgotten was the grumbling
the rain and cold mattered not at all
human pygmies prepared to test their
strength against a rushing monster of
steel wasps about to attack an elephant
perhaps they hac a fleeting thought for
a tablet that besrs the names of other
men in gray who once attempted what
they were about to do and with results
that were not pleasant they pushed
head work



the girl laughed whats a mere cus-
tomhouse among frienis she asked

that thought aside this was action
and they loved it

  two shafts of light struggling in the
moist darkness shot over the crest of
the hill the shafts of light leveled off
they were deflected downward they
became more brilliant as they ap-
proached

  linton deserted the shadows at the
side of the road and started forward
he walked warily taking care not to al-
low his form to loom in the direct path
of the lights

  and then it happened

  the two shafts of light veered to the
left instead of continuing south to-
ward the troopers they raced toward
the west then-it seemed almost at
once to the troopers-the lights swung
around again heading south and the
wanted car was speeding on its merry
way along a road that ran parallel to
the one upon which the troopers were
stationed-and a good hundred yards
away

  there was no time for orders none
were needed

  crosby and linton raced across a dark
field hoping to corns out on the other
road before the car had passed

  crosby made it first his flashlight
threw out a warning he shouted the
command

  halt state police

  he drew himself up abruptly as he
realized the ray of light and the com-

mand both were directed at the rear of a
speeding car the driver of which was
completely unaware of his presence

  linton fared the same

  he and crosby met swore softly and
then raced back to where the chase-car
had been stationed

  meanwhile messrs david and king
had done what they rightly considered
some smart thinking as david piled
into the car king headed south this
road they reasoned probably had a con-
nection with the other road to the south
as well as the one to the north over
which the dope car had traveled fur-
thermore if they headed north to the
other detour they would have a stern
chase and a hopeless chase

  all of which was excellent reasoning
knowledge of that fact consoled them as
they raced southward but their logic
had one fault they realized that as
they pulled to an abrupt halt just in
time to avoid striking a barn which
was located where the road ended

 so messrs david and king swore
softly turned the car around and re-
traced their steps they were joined by
messrs crosby and linton the con-
versation was at least spirited

  mr linton suggested continuing the
chase mr david vetoed the suggestion
pointing out that the car had a lead it
would be impossible to overcome

  at this point some bitterness crept
into the dialogue


the blue book magazine

  mr king i was ordered not to do
any thinking otherwise i would have
pointed out that we might have im-
proved the shining hours by making sure
we were on the right road and looking
for crossroads and detours

  mr crosby point that out when
the skipper holds the autopsy it may
save you your stripes and your job
mr king  i didnt get my job or my
stripes by pointing things out and i
dont have to hold them that way

  mr crosby  lets pretend i didnt
say that jack i am sorry

  mr king forget it jim

  mr david lets pretend one of us
has a bright thought

  mr linton  now that the best
minds have nothing to offer how about
getting to a telephone and putting a
general alarm on the teletype a patrol
down the line might pick that baby up
mr david ever see an advertise-
ment in a newspaper that read like this
i am incompetent i have muffed my
job i wish somebody else would do it
for me 

  mr linton  i cant recall ever read-
ing anything just like that

  mr david what you suggested
would be the same thing

  mr linton  i am going up and
have a look at that corner i want to
see how we got switched to a private
road

  mr king save some of the mud
you can show it to your grandchildren
some day tell them it came from the
corner that cost grandpappy his job
mr crosby personally i have no
desire to look at the road i know it is
there the fact that a dope car went
over it at eighty miles an hour proves
that it is there i am quick like that
mr king the old man is quick
too

  mr crosby right you birds were
wrong when you said i would be all
washed up by the first of the month it
will happen tomorrow-today rather
the skipper promised it to tiny and me
if anything like this happened maybe
you two lesser items will get off with
semi-permanent assignments to the
stables after all we were supposed to
be doing your thinking for you as we
will point out

  all right said tiny david his
voice was gruff can the inquest he
made a mental reservation that full
blame for the proceedings would rest on
the shoulders of one lieutenant edward

david and nowhere else lets get
organized speaking as a committee of
one i dont yearn to go in and report
how stupid we were furthermore i
dont subscribe to telling the old man
we didnt see the car we might get
away with it but i like to be able to
look at myself when i shave in the
mornings

  they gave ready assent

  and thatj tiny david declared
brings us right back to the old stand
just what is our story if anybody has
a thought let the little stranger in there
are witnesses

  apparently no thoughts were knocking
for admission

  what do you suggest tiny asked
crosby

  we might get on a boat and go to
china

not far enough linton objected
any law against us getting a cup of
coffee asked crosby they always
let the condemned nan select what he
wants for his last dinner

   they were seated in the car and about
to start for plazy when a second pair of
headlights appeared to the north these
head work



we pretended to swallow the story
said tiny david and he stifled a yawn



lights moved slowly they were barely
making headway through the rain

  tiny david groaned

  might as well go through the mo-
tions come on

  their cry halt-state police was
answered at once the car pulled to the
side of the road and stopped

  tiny david flashlight in hand ad-
vanced hello there

  he threw open the door of the car
and the light revealed the occupants of
the front seat a young man smartly
dressed was at the wheel a stunning-
looking girl sat very close to the driver

  streamlined was the softly spoken
comment of mr crosby who stood be-
hind the man with the flashlight

  whats the big idea tiny david
asked

the youth appeared to be overcome
with embarrassment but the girl giggled

  it sounds foolish now she admitted
but at the time it seemed like a swell
idea we were at a party we didnt
want to go home so we went for a ride
tiny david stepped to the front of
the car and then returned

  canadian license he muttered how
did you get through the customs  they
close at midnight

  the girl laughed again

  whats a mere customhouse among
friends she asked well be back
before they are open we are just going
to plantville to get a bite to eat

  tiny david shook his head

  bad business confiscate your car
if they catch you and you never know
what you will run into just to show
you a dope-car shot through here not so
long ago

the girls eyes widened really
yes really suppose you had been
mixed up in an accident with it and
couldnt show any clearance-papers to
enter this country

  the girl nodded soberly

  it wasnt such a bright idea she id-
mitted home for us-eh victor
tiny david chuckled

  im no killjoy he asserted but
lets make it regular tell you what
well do ill ride back with you to the
border we will wake them up-they
are friends of mine-and get you cleared
properly after that let your conscience
guide you and the night is young
thats swell the girl declared but
it makes a lot of trouble for you

  costs me nothing but time tiny
david objected have lots of that
	the blue book magazine

expect to have even more later he
turned to his companions wait here
for me wont be gone long

  he walked toward the rear door of the
car ready to enter the voice of the
girl halted him it was soft musical
and enticing

  plenty of room here beside me but
perhaps you would rather be alone
tiny david grinned

  i cant think of anything nicer he
declared as he crowded in beside the
girl   

  it was a short run to the border a
sleepy canadian official protested at first
and then agreed to clear the car as a
favor to tiny david the lieutenant
handed the paper to the driver

  that means you are all through with
us  the trooper asked

  the official nodded

 tiny david walked south to the
american customs his call soon aroused
an official and the lights on the porch
were snapped on the american official
who appeared was less inclined to be
agreeable he yielded under the running
fire of tiny davids comments

  the car pulled up beside the trooper
now said tiny david if you will
run me back to my gang you two can
be on your merry way much nicer to
know you are on the right side of the
law isnt it

  the girl moved over to make room be-
side her the light from the porch of
the customhouse illuminated the rear of
the car tiny david leaned over and
apparently picked up something from the
road

  thats funny he said his deep
chuckle was contagious step out here
a minute you two i want to show you
something

on the running-board of the police-
car sat crosby king and linton
wrapped in gloom as dark as the night

  fixing up those dimwits declared
mr crosby is my idea of the last
straw i would have taken them in as
an alibi that would prove we had at
least been here

silence greeted this announcement
tiny continued mr crosby drives
off in a closed car sitting next to a
slinky-looking dame and leaves us out
in the rain fine-

  shut up growled king it helps
kill time doesnt it  and the more time
we kill the longer it will be before we
get our chance to stand on a carpet and

tell all as the newspapers so quaintly
say

  they killed more time the first
traces of a cloudy dawn banished the
inky blackness the rain abated there
was no sign of tiny david and his
wards but a car approached from the
south

  they turned and watched it draw
near mr linton made the discovery

  mrs linton   he moaned watch
over your ernng son thats the skip-
pers car 

  quickly they scrambled to their feet
it was an abashed trio that greeted the
commanding officer of the black horse
troop as he stepped from his car be-
hind him making signs that this was an
occasion upon which no levity would be
tolerated-signs for which there was not
the slightest need-came max payton
the top sergeant

crosby the obligations of rank
heavy upon him stepped forward a
little to bear the lull brunt of the ex-
pected onslaught

  how is it going

  fair captain

  any luck

  not so much lurk captain
  humph

  there was a heavy poignant silence
  where is lieutenant david

  he should be back any minute cap-
tain

  they saw the old familiar signs-
signs they had witnessed ever so often
and signs which always foretold trouble
for the persons who watched them cap-
tain fields face flushed his arms be-
gan to swing he paced up and down
then halted before lieutenant crosby

  can you answer one question intelli-
gently

  i think so captain

  dont tell me that snapped captain
field you cant think i send you
four nitwits out here to stop one car
and what happens ill tell you-

  he halted abruptly as a sedan ap-
proaching from the north pulled to a
halt beside him the rear door opened
tiny david climbed slowly out he
saluted as he saw captain field that
operation completed he yawned
morning captain

  the silence that followed the greet-
ing was ominous

  weather seems clearing up a bit
captain field they gathered was not
interested in the weather
head work



  tiny david cast about for a safe topic
of conversation

  havent seen a morning paper have
you captain  murder trial out in den-
ver that i am following they summed
up yesterday and-

the long-delayed explosion shook the
earth it started with a picturesque
account of the deficiencies mental and
physical of four men it continued with
a list of their transgressions it included
an announcement regarding their futures
it concluded with the indictment

  sent out to get a car    told where
to go    told what time it was due
   three of you asleep    other one
riding around with a girl    car runs

right through you----driver didnt even

see you    we pick him up five miles
south of plantville   car empty then
   probably unloaded after he made
monkeys out of you

  captain field paussd for breath the
faces of crosby king and linton were
studies in dismay payton silently con-
veyed his sympathy tiny david regis-
tered polite interest

  was the captain referring to that
pilot-car 

  captain field wheeled upon him
  was i referring to what

  tiny david sighed all this his man-
ner indicated was quite a chore but he
would attack it boldly

  the pilot-car captain went through
here like a bat out oi hell but we didnt
bite on it we figured he was empty
indeed there was a wealth of sar-
casm in that single word but apparently
it was wasted

  no captain we stood back in the
shadows and kissed our fingers at him
he figured this road was clear he
stopped in plantville and put in a tele-
phone-call to the guy driving the car
with the load glad you knocked off the
pilot-car captain thats what i call
real cooperation

  he jerked a thumb toward the sedan
soon as they got the word this crowd
started through smart people clean-
looking fellow swell girl drive slow
so they wont attract attention have a
good story all read

  he gave up his struggle against the
weariness that assailed him and sank to
the running-board o the dope-car

  so sure of themselves that they dont
even try to beat it when i flag them
we pretended to swallow the story and i

rode back with them to clea the car at
the customs    went alone so they
wouldnt think we suspected anything

  they were agreeable enough got
them straight with canada did that so
they wont be able to claim the load
fixed them up with our side of the line
that gives us clear title to the haul

  he laughed softly

  sort of a lowdown trick on those
boys at the customs they didnt give
the car the once-over because they saw
i was in it and they figured it must be
okay well we owe them that for some
other deals they pulled on us

  he stifled a yawn and continued

  two prisoners captain nice people
girl with finishing-school looks and
voice plenty of what mae west uses
boy with best university club manner
nice haul i call it

  car loaded with gum opium stuffed
under the back seat and in the trunk on
the rear big consignment so sure of
themselves they even carried part of the
load open on the floor of the back com-
partment

  the yawn was repeated

  we were just getting ready to run
them to plantville and book them when
the captain drove up all right if we go
ahead sir

  captain fields eyes were twinkling

  yes he walked toward his car
accompanied by sergeant payton

lieutenant crosby moved close
j to tiny david

  when did you tumble to it tiny
he whispered

  tiny david spoke without moving his
lips

  thought it was funny she went to so
much trouble to vamp me and get me in
the front seat wasnt sure but when
she pulled it again up at the line i knew
something was funny then the light
flashed on those tins on the back floor
and i was sure

  captain field leaned from his car
and motioned to tiny david the big
man walked to his side

  where did you pick up the horseshoe
tiny

  an injured expression crossed tiny
davids face

  i didnt have a horseshoe captain
didnt need it his thumb indicated
his companions this is a smart patrol
use their heads every minute head-
work gets you more than horseshoes

by h bedford-jones

captain bill williams lives
down at san pedro that haven of
retired ocean skippers he dropped
in to see me the other night bringing
along a package a suitcase and his trim
little swiss wife bill is husky red-
haired looks like a bruiser-and has the
biggest heart that ever took a sailing-
ship around the horn

  you need help mister he said after
the secopd drink and ive come to the
rescue these stories of yours in blue
book about significant weapons that
have guided the worlds history have
passed up some good bets you need a
naval reserve officer like me to chart
your course now heres a weapon that
affected history commerce navigation
exploration and everything else

  he opened up his package to disclose
a ship model not a highly varnished
model of imitation sails and gimcracks
but a dingy honest ugly creature bat-
tered by time and circumstance

  i looked at it and shook my head
sorry bill you mean well but a
ship isnt a weapon

 yeah the blind man says the
elephant is a flea commented bill cheer-
fully a horse a catapult a battering-
ram all are weapons troy was taken
by a wooden horse an airplane or tank
is a weapon like a submarine the
viking ship was a weapon that scourged
the world

  you could extend the theory to earth-
quakes or financial systems i said

  as the emperor of abyssinia tried
to do commented bill and touched the
old ship model before him two masts
a long low hull the battle of lepanto
which crushed the turkish sea-power
forever was fought with oared galleys
and that finished oared ships some-
thing new developed that killed em for-
ever this was it

  a sailing-ship i looked at the mod-
el she had a huge spread of canvas
with auxiliary oars nothing new here
bill ships always had sails
nothings ever new its the applica-
tion he rejoined its the human and

individual element thats novel a man
a woman this ship-and the course of
history was ftintrolled by them for two
hundred years a very definite weapon
this a weapon of hatred love terror
a weapon with a story

  wheres the story i demanded
skeptically bill williams waved his
hand at the suitcise he had fetched
along it contained a lot of books

  its there but wait feller youve
been to morocco

  four years ago

  uh-huh and bill nodded solemnly
well i got this ship model from a guy
in rabat he had stolen it out of a place
in the town across the river-sale where
the sallee rovers came from my ship
had come up from senegal and the en-
gines went bust arid we laid a month
in that rotten little river	

  he paused to give his wife an affec-
tionate grin

  marie got the story for me those
books are french i dont savvy them
but she does shes marked the refer-
ences for you since the french took
over morocco theyve dug some queer
things out of its history one of those
books has photostats of a letter from the
sultan of morocco to james ii offering
to put him back on the english throne
if hed become a mohammedan and
more important the yarn of simon dan-
ser

  never heard of him i said

  you will some say he was a hol-
lander named jensen  but the other name
fits better well look at those sallee
rovers they came from spain from the
town of hornachos these hornacheros
were kicked out in -an unruly
factious turbulent tribe they settled
at sale vowing eternal hatred to all
spaniards the presnt-day rabat-you
know the place there were a lot of
renegades in morocco then one whole
province being occupied by them and
this simon danser was a seaman from
flanders who had made himself solid
you can appreciate the story better of
course knowing the scene-

lee rover you live

adventure in the
company of desper-

another step in the
development of arms
that recognizes a
ship as a weapon

 john clymer

rais mami raced to take
charge his guns began to
speak but two of the ships
had come close enough to
fling grapnels from thisir
hatches poured up swarms
of men his ship was grep
pledt boarded

  did i know the scene  i knew every
inch of it had taken movies of it had
dreamed along its ruins and battlements
the huge cliff on one side of the river-
mouth the cliff overhanging the sea
with its enormous gun-platform on top
the massive ruins of the citadel all
around across the river lay the old
town of sale founded by the romans as
sala colonia the dark river ran up be-
tween the two towns to that glorious
tower of hassan built by the architect
of the giralda in seville merely the
minaret of a mosque that hd vanished
city after city had vanished in this
place leaving each some incredible me-
mento and naught beside

  a tough gang those hornacheros bred
to brigandage they occupied the town
surrounding the citadel on the great
rock and getting together a few oared
galleys began to raid the coasts of spain
by way of revenge for their expulsion
their small galleys could not breast the
atlantic surges nor meet large ships yet
the hornacheros would fight anyone and

everyone by  they were a power
in the land giving the sultan a tenth of
all loot and of their christian slaves

so comes simon danser or rais ma-
mi as he was known in islam cross-
ing the bar at high tide and sailing into
the river with a thunder of joyful guns
-his own galley shattered and smashed
towed astern of a two-hundred-ton span-
ish ship

  he brought her to anchor and the
boats and barges came forth the slaves
and the plunder began to flow ashore
the hornacheros dark grim men wel-
comed him as a son caid mustapha
who ruled sale for the sultan stepped
aboard the spanish ship with his swag-
gering negroid soldiers and greeted rais
mami


	the blue book magazine

  a man still young was the renegade
fleming a ruddy-haired man alive with
vigor and energy with him unveiled
in the fashion of the spanish moors was
a girl who was like a flame a captive
almira by name but joyous in her cap-
tivity rais mami took her hand kissed
it in knightly fashion and presented her
to the caid

  my plunder caid mustapha with
the blessing of allah he said proudly
she is my share of this booty-i claim
no more

  caid mustapha however took one
look at the girl and praised allah aloud

  seek some other he said carelessly
by the beard of the prophet this girl
is for sultan zidan alone she shall go
into the quarters of the women in the
citadel until the next caravan is ready
to take her to fez

  what cried rais mami in hot an-
ger he tore off his tunic to show a
bloody scarf about his chest look
you caid mustapha i bought this
woman with my own blood i took her
from a spanish town from the midst-
peace said the caid with a sign to
his guards it is the law that one
tenth of all spoil goes to the sultan and
that his tenth shall be the first chosen
seek another woman i tell you-unless
ou choose to sit upon a stake you
rigands from hornachos are lucky to
have this haven of refuge

  rais mami slipped out sword in a
fury of passion but the bandage came
from his wound there was a rush of
blood and he fell fainting when he re-
covered the caid was gone and almira
with him and the matter was closed
from this situation arose history   
true rais mami went to the citadel
and had audience with caid mustapha
and came near to his death there for
his insolence he was barred from the
citadel and being a renegade was put
under close surveillance although not
molested he was a renegade and not
one of the hornacheros but they had
taken him into their number and made
much of him they did not relish the
treatment given him nor the scorn in
which the caid held them they them-
selves did not love these moroccans by
a good deal

  time passed and almira remained in
the citadel since no caravan could leave
for fez until the rains were over rais
mami went much about the town brood-
ing talking with the hornacheros talk-
ing with the flemings and english the

peace said the caid

dutch and the genoese this was the
twilight of moroccos golden age when
consuls and traders of half christendom
gathered there and welcome and rais
mami the renegade could talk with them
all in their own tongues morocco hated
the spaniards but hated no other chris-
tians in that day	t

  nursing his wound rais mami spent
much time in the shipyard up the river
the captured spanish ship was turned
over to him and he put men to work up-
on her he was busy with the dutch
merchants with renegades with captive
seamen and he carried about with him
the little model of a ship he had con-
trived patterned al ter the spanish ship
which he was remodeling

  that he was deeply in love with al-
mira that she returned his affection was
no secret it was ndeed something of
a joke among the moors whose jests are
cruel    rais mami however never
opened his mouth on the matter but if
by chance his gaze fell upon caid mus-
tapha his bronzed features whitened and
a glitter came into his eyes he could
gain no access to the citadel nor to al-
mira but sometimes he could catch
sight of her not even the heavy cloak-
ing garb and veil of moroccan women
could disguise her figure or her fine free
walk

   she would come into the street of the
consuls leading from the tremendous
square gate of the citadel and pass
among the slaves who were marketed in
this street-but so well guarded with
naked blades that any approach would
have been vain evidently the caid
arms and men



this girl is for sultan zidan seek another woman i tell you

humored her in this notion of hers she
had a great pity for these slaves and
being both moor and goth in blood
could give them money and kind words

  fire-flame as she was it was all for
softer gentler things in this land of white
sun and red blood she loved the fierce
quick race of hissing waves the straining
lift of a ship in storm the life of little
men encompassed on ships deck by wide
horizons but for hurt folk or those suf-
fering in chains she had only a pity as
flaming as her hot love

  and rais mami remembering all these
things of her knowing for what inland
hell she was destined writhed in agony
and bit his lips to blood

  the work on his ship went apace
though he was not too often watching it

he spent much time in the lovely deep
gardens of old sale idling with the ship-
model he had contrivixl while the great
water-wheels creaked the people of
this white town over the river liked him
they had no love for the fierce wolfish
hornacheros the city was one of ar-
tisans and rais mami picked out cer-
tain men to work in the shipyard and
they were glad the fleming had a way
with him and was able to lead not drive

  often he went to the flat top of the
tower of hassan whence was outspread
a view of all the countryside the towns
and gardens the glittering sea beyond

here he would work much on his ship-
model also he had his own quarters in
the town below the citadel but not
among the hornacheros he did not see
them frequently for it was no secret that
he was being watchec 

  it was at this time that rais mami
arranged for a flare to be placed on the
ancient tower he discovered that this
high point was visible from various an-
gles outside the bar and after consulting
with the captains of galleys established
a light from the tower as a night-guide
to any galleys seeking to cross the bar
and enter the river

  when does the caravan of the sultan
depart he asked as he sat one day in
the mosque with grim old abd el hak
the one-eyed a chief among the horna-
cheros

  in five days my son so great is the
booty that more camels are needed

  a pity it should go to the sultan
said rais mami darkly and some of
it will not go i sent a message to one
of the captives this morning

  aye said the old veteran by a
woman she was slain an hour ago the
message was not delivered the caid
mustapha talks of punishing your inso-
lence

  rais mami looked at him with blood-
shot eyes

  in the name of allah shall i tell
you the truth i am in love with that
woman she loves me

  god alone knows all things my son
said abd el hak exploring his gray
beard one woman is like another
when i was a young man in estrama-
dura-

  you are an old man in sale broke
in rais mami fiercely the sultan is
far away a weak man his power waning
here is an impregnable place tonight
if you will listen ill tell you how to


the blue book magazine

gain greater wealth than the sultan has
and more power

  allah upon you exclaimed the
other hastily speak not such words
here where every brick is a spy you
yourself are under suspicion the caid
has men watching you

  rais mami laughed shortly right
ill speak my mind tonight among the
dead bring with you the chiefs of the
hornacheros it is friday the women
will be going to pray at the tombs of the
old sultans in the big hall of the
guard inside the chella gateway are no
spies save the dead an hour before
sunset yes or no

  abd el hak fingered his beard the
one grim eye glittering true the women
would be flocking away to pray at the
tombs and gossip no one would think
anything of it if men were among them
he nodded

  may allah further the event my son
we meet you there

  rais mami rose and departed from the
mosque outside he went to the plat-
form at the seaward verge of the great
rock where cannon were mounted he
looked up at the massive battlements of
the citadel somewhere there safely
tended was almira-destined for the
sultan as far from his reach as though
in the moon

  he turned and looked down below
in the river lay the pirate galleys and
beyond these were three ships genoese
english french under safe-conduct of
commerce rais mami eyed them hun-
grily avidly a few hornacheros passed
with a word of greeting to him-gaunt
fierce men guards of caid mustapha
loitered about keeping a furtive eye on
him swaggering fellows these fat with
misrule out across the river rose the
white city of sale against the blue sky
and the glorious red tower of hassan
lifted two miles away amid cactus and
ruins like a finger pointing to allah

  yet there was a more wonderful me-
mento of the dead to be seen if one knew
where to seek-a scant couple of miles
more up the river valley

                            

rais mami looked at the pirate gal-
 leys again in contempt no good
in heavy weather unable to carry guns
of weight they could take raiding par-
ties to the canaries or the spanish coast
this was all the moroccan raiders
could not pass gibraltar for the galleys
of algiers and tunis held all the medi-
terranean as their own prey yet had

the sallee rovers proper ships the whole
world lay open to them

  presently he turned from the platform
wended his way through the narrow
streets around the citadel left its mag-
nificent gateway and in the town out-
side sought his own quarters under his
robe he tucked the model of a ship on
which he had worked he went present-
ly to the slave market then to the ani-
mal market and there rented a horse

  ten minifies later he was spurring to-
ward the uplands coursing across the
long slopes riding like mad in the keen
wind any followers were flung off they
would spy on him the minute he re-
turned of course he laughed fiercely
exultantly and spurred the harder

an hour before sunset his horse lath-
 ered white with foam he was cir-
cling back toward the town before him
grew one of the most impressive sights
in africa

  here had been the ancient city chel-
la now not a stone of it remained ex-
cept a few tombs by the river and here
the city walls with their gate of vic-
tory the towers of this gate reached
up like giant hands to heaven grotesque
massive the walls so high that the hu-
man creatures below them seemed as
dots women white-clad streamed in
and out of that enormous empty gate-
way on their friday errands of prayer
and gossip like the walls of carcas-
sonne these gaum reddish battlements
bespoke an older zge when men by the
hundred thousand came pouring out of
the sahara for the conquest of spain

  rais mami pricked his way along the
gigantic wall to the gateway he dis-
mounted and led his horse across the
rubble on the inner side he left the
horse bare cactus-grown fields stretched
here where the city had stood down to
the olives and the tombs by the river
not a stone left standing in all this
place

  he himself turned aside within the
gateway behind it remained only a
tower he entered this passing a young
hornachero who stood there silent a
sentry and was in the ancient hall of
the guard

  a dozen men sat there silent awaiting
him gaunt men bred in spain who
hated everything christian with their
whole fierce souls like hot-eyed
wolves they were

  rais mami came into the midst of
them he saluted them gravely opened
arms and men	

his robe and placed on the stone floor
the model of his ship

  in the name of allah he said ab-
ruptly harshly without any preamble
here is the ship i am making i have
chosen a hundred men from among the
slaves to handle her canvas and spars
certain dutch and english renegades to
handle her guns she is to be the first
of many from sale will go forth these
ships no mere galleys but ships to fight
the christian world to sail the wide
seas to plunder french english dutch
as well as the accursed spaniard

  look at these sails he went on of
large size and special design so with
the spars we shall build our own ships
here or build over those that we capture
here in your hands i put a weapon
against the christian world

  deep eyes glittered a man spoke up
build such ships or build them over
rais mami but that takes materials
iron canvas everything and guns
 rais mami threw down a paper writ-
ten in arabic and sealed

  read that said he it is an agree-
ment with the hollanders they will
supply all we need even to chains for
prisoners in return we leave their
ships alone they will even provide
skilled workmen

  the others crowded about to read the
document one and ancther caught his
breath grim abd el hak looked up his
one eye a flame and spcke hoarsely

  by allah and allah and allah the
omnipotent with whom have these
hollanders made the agreement not
with the sultan zidan  with his caid
but with a council of sale whose names
are not yet signed-

  sign them said rais mami the
names are yours are you hornacheros
city curs to send tributt to a weakling
sultan be wolves as once you were
in estramadura but now wolves of the
sea the citadel is impregnable seize
it i have here a list of renegades who
understand artillery turn the guns on
sale across the river upon this rock of
ours erect an independent state a repub-
lic owning allegiance to none in that
caravan destined for the sultan is wealth
enough to make us all rich seize it

the men who listened were not given
to counting costs the sultans au-
thority maddened them they were
conscious of their own outlaw strength
they saw the picture rais mami painted
for them with cunning words and their

eyes gleamed their nostrils dilated the
old arab lust for freedom plunder and
blood laid hold terribly upon their souls

  because you love a woman growled
abd el hak you would plunge us all
into death

  into glory-with me and rais ma-
mi laughed harshly refuse and what
happens tomorrow night i seize the
citadel with my men kill the caid and
his guards take the woman i desire-
and go my ship is nearly ready if the
hornachero blood has died out well and
good let the dream pass away you
who were once wolves-

  by allah does a renegade put shame
on my head burst forth a voice from
the group let me bear fire but not
shame slay slay bear testimony
with the sword against all christians
the flood of fanaticism was loosened
voices rolled up hoarse assent a cer-
tain furious madness came upon all these
men until the ancient stones quivered
to the storm of their oaths and wild fury
thus in the gateway of the city of the
dead was born the republic of sea-wolves

daylight grew gray upon the old
tower of hassan and the white city
of sale and the towering rock of the bat-
tlemented citadel come ye to prayer
quavered the voice of the muezzin from
the minarets come ye to prayer for
prayer is better than slumber 

  shadows flitted along the foot-wide
runways of the battlements naked
bearded hornacheros white renegades
freed slaves one and all hated the
swaggering soldiery largely of negroid
stock who served sultan zidan hatred
flamed on the gun-platform in the fort
below the cliff in the narrow streets
about the citadel and castle a sentinel
shrieked and died a gun roared then
the tide of slaughter burst forth and on
its wave-crest rais mami and his sea-
men came flooding into the quarters of
caid mustapha

  guards died eunuchs were put to the
sword the caid himself scimitar in
hand came rushing upon rais mami
and was cut down with one blow his
head was flung to the courtyard below
and resistance ended treasure and guns
citadel and armory and powder all was
in the horny hands of the hornacheros

  and if the white city opposite resisted
-as it did-the guns of the rock were
turned to hurl death and destruction
and if the army of the sultan came-
as it did-it went home again whipped

  in the quarters of the women now
taken over for new owners rais mami
came upon the spanish girl almira slim
and slender she was with a soul of fire
that looked forth from her golden eyes
and rais mami dropped his red blade
and knelt before her his fierce features
transfigured

  life and freedom almira  rang out
his voice life and love and the wide
horizon these are yours and mine
from this day forth

  in this fashion the renegades dream
was brought to fruition   

  a bad man no doubt an arrant ras-
cal you would say whose story was not
fit to interest honest men the point
might bear discussion morocco had
been filled with thousands of his kind-
men who fled from feudal rapacity from
tyranny from hopeless economic condi-
tions from the lack of any future here
in islam a slave might become an emir
which was answer enough

  so rais mami the slender fire-filled
girl beside him fell to work at his new
weapon and sailed forth with it to

scourge the seas leaving the new repub-
lic to deal with its own problems

  those men of hornachos were shrewd
and savagely capable once shown the
way they reduced old sale to submis-
sion took advartage of the internal dis-
sensions which left the sultan powerless
and established their pirate state in fact
as well as in name and the loot began
to roll in

  with itg hugs spread of canvas its
speed ana armament its auxiliary oars
the ship of rais mami could outsail and
outfight the average merchant craft he
opened a new career a new vista to
these brigands cf morocco and on the
wide seas he rz vaged like a wolf in a
sheepfold

  the horrified french the dismayed
english found themselves no longer se-
cure from molestation treaties with
morocco were laughed at not rais
mami alone but other ships armed and
equipped like hi own came forth to seek
prey-these hornacheros cared nothing
for commerce except to batten upon it
savagely
arms and men

  the sallee rovers fell upon all chris-
tendom ravening from the banks of
newfoundland to the coast of ireland
merciless and insatiable in two years
forty vessels from havre-de-grace alone
fed their rapacious maw in  above
sixty prizes jammed the river under the
cliff more than six thousand christian
slaves jammed the slave-market and
wealth incalculable jammed the coffers
of the pirate republic



  for the republic flourished putting in-
to effect the principles of communism-
give nothing and take everything it
laughed at the sultan in its own right
it made treaties with charles of england
with richelieu in france the horna-
cheros were riding high in those days
and highest of them all rode rais mami
the renegade

  with him went ever almira the wom-
an who was like a flame of fire she
seconded him in tempest and in calm
and they two were one but while she
stood with him in battle she never
donned armor or fought never put hand
to weapon living fire was her spirit
but she was no harsh virago the sight
of blood hurt her the sight of suffer-
ing men drew her ever to compassion

aboard ship she cared for crew and
captive alike in the street of the con-
suls she moved among the slaves with
food and money and garments and ten-
derness so that rais mami was wont to
say with a laugh she spent half his win-
nings on the losers curiously enough
the cruel fanatic moors respected this
trait in her and gave her unwonted hon-
or for a woman they had not yet for-
gotten the teachings of the prophet in
respect to mercy and pity

thus had the foretold weapon been
forged and its stroke was keen and ter-
rible upon the world whether the sul-
tan was defied or not morocco profited
by the whole business and turned itself
to hatred of all christians and to plun-
der of christendom these fast armed
ships could fight could raid and run if
they so desired or stay and battle and
once the weapon was learned the horna-
cheros had many rivals in the art of pi-
racy the ransom of christian slaves
became an enormous source of revenue

squadrons came and bombed and bom-
barded in vain the pirates slipped up
the river the great gun-platforms of sale
and the pirate rock thundered down at
the christian ships and rais mami ever
emerged unscathed

but good bishop sourdis whose see
was the maritime city of bordeaux liked
this matter less and ever less for the
shipping of bordeaux suffered heavily

here is the ship i
am making he said
abruptly    here
in your hands i put
a weapon against the
christian world are
you hornacheros city
curs be wolves-
wolves of the sea
	the blue book magazine

and besides his episcopal dignity he
also happened to be commander of the
naval army of france hence he had
some teeth with which to chew on the
affair

  this flemish renegade said the good
warrior prelate must have his wings
clipped and certainly bishop could take
rook so my lord sourdis abandoned
crozier and asperges for the present
after certain conferences with the
merchants of bordeaux he betook him-
self to the wide green diocese of the
atlantic

  thus it came to pass that rais mami
with the flaming-eyed almira beside him
looked forth one morning as they cruised
the french coast and beheld four small
ships of bordeaux coming with the
breeze all unsuspicious

  rais mami hoisted the dutch flag
and laughed for the wind was falling
fast calm was coming down the sea and
once his oars were put forth he had
those four small ships at his mercy
praise be to allah

o	you remember said almira as
they stood at the rail watching
that model ship you made long ago
and left at the citadel for the workmen
to use in remaking other ships

  i should remember it well said rais
mami his eyes softening a little
why

  it is over the river in sale she re-
sponded i saw it there just before we
sailed it is in the courtyard of the
school there-the medersa built by the
sultan abou inan three hundred years
ago they have put it near the foun-
tain

  rais mami laughed at this and squint-
ed at the four ships in the sunlight

  you think of strange things in the
hour of battle said he lightly

  the beautiful eyes of the woman be-
side him darkened

  still stranger things perhaps she
rejoined for the inscription over that
fountain in the school was running in
my mind you know it

  by allah i have other things to
ponder  and rais mami chuckled
what was it

  it has nothing to do with battle at
least she said but that lovely little
model ship seemed placed most ap-
propriately the inscription is short
the workmen have here finished an
artistic work filled with the beauty of
youth lovely ship lovely words i 

  rais mami turned to stare at her
curiously

  what the devil is in your mind
at such a moment as this- well you
have strange moods and i love you for
them come ill make you a present
of whichever one of yonder ships you
fancy choose 

  she looked at the four ships which
were grouped together and her eyes
dulled then she shook her head and
turned away without reply

rais mami with an impatient oath
 sent his christian slaves to the oars
made ready to run them out put his men
to the lines the breeze was dying fast
the four ships of bordeaux quite un-
suspicious were close at hand their can-
vas filling and flapping the sea was
glassy catspaws of wind creeping across
the long swells and fading away rais
mami lifted his voice as the canvas was
brought in

  out oars down ports into the
midst of them helmsman

  the ports clattered open the guns
were run forth the oars struck out and
dipped from below poured up thp cor-
sairs with beat of drums and shrilling
horns and the dutch flag fluttered down

  the mask waj off straight in among
the hapless freichmen drove the ship
her six guns to a side ready to hurl death
rais mami leaped to the rail to hail
those victims and order surrender they
were clumsy ships those four heaped
high with deck cargo it seemed

  but as he opened his lips to hail his
voice died

  the four were close around him now
and men were leaping to work tar-
paulins were jerked away no deck
cargo but guns cannon men pouring
up from below each ship suddenly bris-
tling with figures in the rigging and
before rais maui could speak or give
command before he could realize that
he was trapped those four little ships
began to pour a deadly storm of bullets
into him

  bullets no shot guns crammed with
bullets that hailed across his decks
swept into his open ports struck down
his crew and oarsmen flung everything
into mad chaos aboard fusils and mus-
kets opened from the rigging around
his decks were  shambles

  like a madman rais mami raced to
take charge to waken his stunned men
his guns began to speak but two of the
smaller ships had put out sweeps and
arms and men



come close enough to fling grapnels
from their hatches paured up men
swarms of men his ship was grappled
was boarded

   desperately frantically the remnants
of the corsairs gathered allah il al-
lah pealed up the cry rais mami
headed them smashed nto the boarders
cleared the waist of his ship useless 
he turned to survey the poop and a
frightful cry broke from him he saw
almira there at the rail of the quarter-
deck sinking upon her face her arms ex-
tended as though reaching toward him

  everything else fled from him then
he turned leaped across the shambles
gained the ladder and regained her side
he forgot the battle the press of men the
whelming of disaster as he lifted her in
his arms she was dying smiling as she
died and her eyes flamed up at him with
one last long look

   an artistic work she gasped filled
with-with the beauty oj youth-

   and laughing hysterically she tried to
draw herself up failed and went limp
in his arms

  he was kneeling there holding her
close when they came in around him
he saw nothing heard nothing until he
was suddenly aware that these were
frenchmen who stood all about staring
curiously at him he started up

  there was no longer a battle in the
waist of his ship freed slaves were yam-
mering their rejoicings christian voices
were rising high men were flooding ev-
erywhere-but not his men these were
gone rais mami passed a hand over
his eyes wiped them clear gazed at the
tall frenchman in half armor who ad-
dressed him

  they say you are their leader you
speak french

  they say his men of course some
few captives taken or the wounded
rais mami stared around then his eyes
came back to the tall frenchman

  speak french he said dully yes
i am rais mami

a word passed a sharp breath a
mutter rais mami the renegade
and i said the frenchman am the
bishop of bordeaux monsieur you are
my prisoner have you anything to say
before i hang you 

  rais mami looked down at the figure
on the deck his hands fell he went
to one knee lifted the clead slim hand
andi touched his lips to it then he stood

up again and looked at bishop sourdis
and a smile touched his lips

  why yes said he not your pris-
oner my lord bishop but that of god
an artistic work filled with the beauty
of youth- his voice faltered

  blasphemer said the bishop stern-
ly and beckoned his men hang him
they hanged him there above the
glassy sea 

  the good bishop accounted his last
words blasphemy and so reported them
with much advice on how the entire

eirate roost of sale should be and might
e rooted forth and yet curiously
enough they were entirely natural words
a lovely thought that came too late into
barren bloody lives a search for what
might have been and was not a wistful
subconscious expression in the moment
of destinys impact for thus mans
brain sometimes works upon trifles

so i came back again from my own
memories of those battlemented cliffs
and the glorious red tower of hassan to
bill williams and his charming little
wife and the ship-model that bill was
fingering

  you know he said its a funny
thing-i mean this here ship-model old
and dirty and all but damned well done
took a seaman to do it in the first place
wonder where that chap swiped it from 
some old place over in sale he told me
i gave him some french senegal money
for it paper money

  it should go into the collection of my
friend martin burnside i said slowly
he collects weapons you know

  yeah heard about him said bill
well you think a ship can be a wea-
pon

i nodded and took the model from
him and examined it with some atten-
tion then i glanced up at him sharply
have you done any carving on this 
who me bill guffawed not
much why 

  nothing i replied what are the
chances of turning this over to burn-
side 

  youre welcome said bill with a
wave of his hand give it to him with
my compliments

  so	i did and when i gave it to him
pointed out the two letters carved on the
stern of the model as in some idle mo-
ment s d-that was all but they
made me think of simon danser the
flemish renegade-and wonder

air adventure by the pilot writer who gave us murder
island the flaming finish and the speed king

a curtained black sedan with a
bent fender and a shattered rear
 side window snored out spring
street keeping the sedate pace of satur-
day-night traffic the driver a small
man with glittering weasel eyes paused
at a red light and turned and stared into
the shadows of the rear seat where joe
marvin and sylvia paulling sat both
bound and gagged

  listen you the driver said to joe
marvin in a voice like a file keep
kickin around back there an ill crack
you on the konk i tried to be gentle
wid you see if you dont like that ill
fix you so you cant squirm he reached
under his left armpit and a grim look
crossed his narrow pasty face he put
the car once more in gear and rolled with
the accelerating traffic

  joe marvin sat there waiting trying
to keep his mind from projecting itself

too starkly into the future there wasnt
any hope he knew yet he could not sur-
render abjectly they had him of course
and would dispose of him in the safest
easiest way mercilessly but he didnt
think primarily about what they were
going to do to him he thought about
sylvia he must do something to help
her    turning slightly he tried to
see her there in the darkness

  all he could see was the pale blur of
her face with the gag a white swathe
over her mouth she was looking at him
her shadowed eyes showing fright she
really was terrified she looked more
terrified than she had that time when
they had been lying in his plane and
the engine caught fire and they had had
to bail out joe wondered if he would
ever have the chance to fly his new
plane again he tried to give sylvia a
confident reassuring glance

                 illlustrated by l r gustavson

  he saw suddenly that she was slip-
ping down to the tonneai floor she lay
on the floor on her side for a moment
and began to get up puzzled he as-
sisted her when he could by pushing her
up with his knees after a long strug-
gle she was back in the seat when she
turned from him and leaned back he
understood what she had dojie

  something sharp was biting into his
wrists something sharp held in sylvias
hands a thrill of hope went over joe
like a shock of electricity he realized
that she had picked up a piece of the
shattered window from the car floor and
was holding it as a knife if he could
cut those cords on his wrists he could
get at the driver by surprise

  yet he had no illusions about the
driver he knew the man was armed
was deadly being discovered in this
effort would bring instant destruction



but being discovered was a risk he must
take he turned with the utmost dif-
ficulty and bent his body forward bring-
ing his bound wrists up as high as
possible over the small of his back so
that sylvia with the piece of glass could
saw at the cords

  haste was paramount now within
ten minutes the driver of the car would
be joined at the outskirts of atlanta by
two other men and after that there
would be no hope whatever joe marvin
knew he would need luck to succeed in
the attack on this one man but he had
to succeed sylvias life might depend
on it his own life most certainly did
he tried to move his wrists to help the
jagged glass cut the cords the ir-
regular jolting of the car threw him off
balance but he braced himself with his
knees now that he had hope each
passing minute was sheer agony
	the blue book magazine

  the car purred through the suburban
section gathering speed but the driver
was taking no chances of being con-
spicuous with haste so he still stayed
in the line of thick traffic he didnt
look back although joe knew he would
look back at the next red light they
must be finished with this by then

  the traffic light ahead glowed amber
it flared red just as they reached it
rapid deceleration almost threw joe to
the floor he could see the driver re-
laxing as the car stopped relaxing and
turning his head and desperate joe
leaned back with his full weight catch-
ing sylvias shoulder and pinioning her
against the cushion the splinter of
glass stabbed cruelly into his wrist

  for ten seconds he held his breath
while he felt the drivers queer luminous
eyes searching the rear of the car with
an infinite silent suspicion sylvias
head was resting on his shoulder in a
strained unnatural way that must ap-
pear noticeable but the traffic bell
clanged and the driver swung back to
his task without saying a word

  instantly with a reckless desperate
haste joe leaned forward again the
jagged glass sawed at the cord he
could hear sylvias quickened excited
breathing as she fought at the half dozen
tough strands it seemed to joe that
they would not possibly have time the
driver was spurring the car now they
were on the outskirts of town

sitting there counting the minutes
and planning desperately what he
would do joe marvin tried to com-
pose himself he could not fully realize
even yet that all this was an actuality
and not a bad dream of course he
knew that dan paulling had received the
two letters demanding money under a
threat of sylvias abduction for days
sylvia had been a virtual prisoner in her
own house and tonight she had struck
on the bold incredibly foolish game of
trying to steal out past the guards and
go to the riding club dance when joe
got to the paulling house expecting an
evening of bridge she was dressed just
as she was dressed now in a pale blue
frock that was cut low in the back and
clung alluringly to her slim figure

  it seemed impossible as joe thought
back over it that he could have assented
to her idiotic proposal but he had and
they had slipped past the guard who
these days was constantly on duty in the
side drive they had gone swiftly and

unobserved so they thought along paces
ferry road in the rain laughing and
thinking it a geat joke on sylvias
father youthfully stirred with their ex-
citing audacity and before they had
ever reached the riding club it had
happened

three men who had been driving a
small roadster passed them and as
they passed skidded on the wet pavement
their fender crushed into joes and both
cars slewed toward the curb a low
branch of a tree shattered the glass of a
rear window of joes car the road
was isolated in this exclusive section of
town and here traffic was light no
other cars were in sight and there was
no escape for the small car blocked the
way the next thing joe knew a man
was on the running-board gun in hand
a soft voice filled with a swift slashing
sibilance said

  climb over into the back seat-dont
open the door

  joe hesitated then he challenged
whats the idea

  the mans spaced words carried a
deadly ruthlessness i said get into the
back seat  the gun was incredibly
steady it fascinated joe more than the
mans face which he could not see very
clearly he dicnt move fast enough
and the gun darted out and then he felt
a sickening pain on the side of his head
pain flowed all over his body numbing
his senses he beard sylvias one stifled
scream but though he tried to struggle
back to consciousness to do something

about it he didnt seem able to move

  later he was vaguely conscious of be-
ing in the back seat and he knew he
was gagged and bound hand and foot
and the lone driver up there at the wheel
was taking them steadily through traffic
with a silent assurance joe looked at
sylvia she too was bound and gagged

  for some tirre the car whined over
the wet streets joe huddled there his
head throbbed he saw the driver turn
and look deeply into the curtained en-
closure presently they stopped at a
side street and a man who apparently
had been waiting there said in a hoarse
barely audible whisper

  okay 

  okay the driver returned hastily
wherell i trade cars with you and
dorn

  stewart avenue at virginia-hape-
ville ill ditch this car what we gonna
do with the guy
the lair in the swamp



the mans spaced words carried a deadly
ruthlessness i said get in o the-back seat

  let dorn decide that the driver
said shrugging you take him im
goin back like we planned for the
dough youre gonna meet dorn and go
inside to the old mans place in the
swamp 

  yeah ill swap license plates and
leave this hack in waycioss after an
instants pause he added dorn dont
like it our snatching somebody along
with the doll did he get a good look
at us

  yeah-he couldnt help gettin a good
look at us

  there was subdued violence in the
other foice then well sneeze him and
dump him in the swamp as we go in
but anyhow we got the doll see you
in ten minutes you be there

  the car rolled again joe marvin sat
straighter in his seat and tried to suck
a full breath into his lungs he was
trembling there was ro use kidding
himself he and sylvia were in a bad
situation

  he twisted his hands straining at the
cords on his wrists but the struggle
was futile the cords only cut deeper
into his flesh then sylvia discovered
that sharp piece of glass   

  they were on stewart avenue now
he tires singing on the lick pavement
is the car rushed through the night joe
rould feel sylvias hurried gasps as she
rought for breath thej would reach
virginia avenue in half a dozen minutes
it this rate of speed

  just then his hands came free he
ubbed his wrists feverishly getting the
irculation started agair he lifted
jylvia back where she had sat before
keeping sharp watch on the driver he
emoved both the gags then he untied
lis ankles working with a tense haste
ilanning they were topping a rise now
nd on the next rise a mile away was
he intersection where this driver was to

be relieved joe wanted to release sylvia
but he didnt have time

  he had no sort of weapon in the
darkness he took off his shoe with a
quick movement he half stood and
struck at the drivers head at the same
time he started to climb over and get at
the steering-wheel so he could stop the
car and could keep it from swerving

  at the first blow the driver ducked
and reached for his gun snarling an
oath joe could see his face in the lights
of an oncoming car his face had a
desperate canine look thin lips drawn
tight over his teeth joe slugged with
the shoe for an instant he thought
they were going to collide head-on with
the passing car and then when that
danger was past he wished they could
have collided for the driver had that
black automatic in his hand and was
trying to jam the muzzle into joes face

joe dropped the shoe and grabbed at
the others wrist with both hands in
a silent frenzy they fought for the
gun the car careened down the highway
swinging gradually to the left joe took
one hand off the drivers wrist and threw
a wild punch at his chin the driver
grunted his breath was a hot blast
he panted this time ill give you the
works 

  after that joe didnt know quite what
happened the gun vomited fire in his
eyes blinding him it was as if he had
looked directly into the sun for a mo-
ment  he couldnt see anything else the
driver was behind the blind spot and
joe had a desperate grip on his wrist
and had a hold on the wheel but he
couldnt see anything the gun went off
again

  he felt the car crash into the em-
bankment at the left side of the road it
lurched up and careened and swerved
down again at high speed the body
	the blue book magazine

twisted when it twisted the right
front door came open the gun blasted
the third time and burning powder
stung joes cheeks until he was in a
frenzy of pain involuntarily he let go
of the driver and the driver who was
a small agile man whirled and got one
foot in the pit of joes stomach and
shoved the next thing joe knew he
was out of the car falling

it seemed to him he fell fifty feet
but of course it wasnt that far he
struck the wet pavement with a nauseat-
ing impact on his left shoulder he
rolled over and over his body felt as
though every bone in it were broken
when he finally lay still he raised him-
self to his hands and knees in the mud
in the steady cold rain the car was
whining over the hill

  joe struggled to his feet and ran after
the car in bleak despair he ran some
twenty paces before he thought to halt
he was sobbing with rage and frustra-
tion his fear for sylvia was a live
frightful thing standing there in the
darkness his clothing torn half off his
body he tried to think what to do

  the savage resolution to track down
the kidnapers burned in his brain for
a few moments it blinded him to every-
thing else then he realized the futility
of trying to do that immediately the
first thing was to get word to dan
paulling sylvias father sylvia would
be missed by this time she hadnt
gone out of the house for so long it
was odd that they hadnt thought of
that when they decided to spend the
evening out at the dance it filled him
with a goading humiliation to think of
having accepted a part in such an idiotic
such a childish escapade as this wras to
have been he loathed himself hurry-
ing back down the road to a telephone

  a motorist picked him up finally and
let him out at a filling-station with
fingers that shook he dialed the paulling
residence a maid answered the phone
he controlled his voice with a vast
effort and said this is joe marvin
i want to speak with mr paulling

  he waited swallowing with a dry
throat as he stood there he knew he
would have been glad to die if only
that would have put sylvia back safe in
her home dan paullings genially gruff
voice came over the wire

  yes joe what is it i thought you
were planning to spend the evening out
here sylvia-

  joe had tried to plan what to say
but he only blurted mr paulling
theyve got sylvia theyve got her
we went out together in the car and
they got her his voice broke he
quit trying to talk and stood there
running his muddy fingers through his
hair in distraction

  there was a long pause he could
hear mr paulling suck in a quick breath
and there was another pause and finally
the gruff voice was grating and incisive
who did you see them

  i dont know three men but i only
saw one of them closely they got my
car-and sylvias in it they drove
south

  are you all right

  yes im at i filling-station on stew-
art avenue i tr ied to stop them but-
his voice broke again to a boyish fal-
setto there was another moment of
hushed waiting joe could hear his
heart beating

  stay there dan paulling ordered
dont say anything to anybody tell
me how to get to you

joe gave directions then he went
out and walked back and forth in the
rain at last mr paulling drove up in
the small car that sylvia had always
used his square leathery face was
strangely blank of emotion as if he were
holding himself tight to keep from feel-
ing anything toe couldnt keep his lips
steady facing dan paulling he knew
the full meaning of fright that comes
from anxiety it ripped through him
sucking away his vitality turning him
old dan paulling said with a restrained
harshness that was to joe more censuring
than any outburst of anger could ever
have been get in here i never
thought youd let sylvia get into this
kind of a mes he turned the car
his face set now tell me about it

  joe told about it holding back noth-
ing he said mr paulling i was a
fool i should have stopped sylvia im
sorry i didnt-i cant tell you how
sorry i am i we dont get her back
why-why ill never get over it-

  we wont get her back being sorry
about it dan paulling grated his wide
mouth very grim you made a mis-
take and weve got to undo it-if we
can do you have any idea where they
were planning to hide her

  joe recalled for the first time that terse
wluspered conversation at the side of the
car he exclaimed theyre going to
the lair in the swamp	

that big swamp near waycross-they
thought i was knocked out but i heard
one of them say something about going
into the swamp and leaving my car at
waycross with new license tags

  the okefenokee de n paulling said
ive been hunting there if they get
her into that swamp well never get to
her-well have to wait until they com-
municate with us-well have to buy her
back everybody thinks im a rich man
but im not very rich i may not be
able to get enough money to buy her
back he opened the car door with a
savage vigor and leaped out he crossed
to the filling-station and dialed a num-
ber the sheriff of fulton county when
nobody answered he jiggled the hook
with a dark impatience and dialed again
then began speaking immediately he
didnt sound excited but every word
came out of his mouth with a violent
impact bill this is dan theyve
got my girl-theyve get sylvia after
all    just a while ago i want you to
block every road between here and way-
cross we think theyre taking her that
way but dont do anything that will
make them hurt her youll have your
boys take care of that when you can
come out to the house he hurried
back to the car and got in now he
said to joe the only thing we can do is
go home and wait and try not to worry
the wheels spewed gravel as he let out
the clutch

  the wind was rising and it was grow-
ing steadily colder the thought came
to joe that if no trace of sylvias kid-
napers was discovered tomorrow he
could take his plane and fly over the
swamp looking he must do something
what he would do even if he found the
shack in the swamp he didnt know

through an interminable night joe
waited with dan paulling and a
small group of confidants in thepaulling
iving-room expecting hoping desperate-
ly that the kidnapers would be picked
ip before they reached the swamp joe
vrote a description of the roadster the
hree men had used and of the one man
le had seen clearly enough to recognize
igain dawn came and there was still
 word from the smaller towns where
he kidnapers had been expected to ap-
ear night wore into raw cold dawn

  and morning brought developments
 muffled voice on the telephone in-
ormed dan paulling put a hundred
ruid in small used bills in an old suit-

case and meet me at the southwest corner
of grant park at eight oclock tonight-
alone dont try to put the finger on me
if anything happens to me youll never
see the girl the speaker gave no time
for questions they couldnt trace the
call

  that night dan paulling took a hun-
dred thousand dollars to the place as
told and waited through four dreadful
hours  no one came

so the second awful night wore on
the rain and low clouds held with
every hour dan paullings face grew
more deeply lined joe marvin walked
the floor and smoked cigarettes when
daylight came utterly cheerless he drove
swiftly toward the flying-field

  he kept his lockheed altair in barry
johnsons hangar and an hour after
daylight he was in the cockpit on the
ramp waiting for the barking engine to
warm up enough to fly beads of rain
whipped off the windshield and slowly
drenched the shoulders of his flying-suit
before he had been off the ground an
hour hed be soaked he knew yet there
were compensations too today flying
near the earth he could see a great deal
without being himself seen although of
course the engines noise would drift far
across the swamp

  he knew that the chance of finding the
right trappers shack was remote yet
he might find it and if he found it he
would do what seemed best at the time-
crack up there and put up the best bat-
tle possible or fly to the nearest town
and get guides and a posse to go back
with him by boat the latter course de-
pended on his marking the location well
enough to find again thoughtfully he
fingered his fathers  as he considered
what might happen and then thrust it
in the side pocket of the cockpit

  he took off presently motor roaring
red mud splashing as he hit the wet
spots in the field the plane rolled a long
way for he had as much gas in the tanks
as they would hold the tendrils of the
clouds were almost in the trees in places
in the first few miles of flight joe
stayed beneath them holding to a com-
pass course

  after a few minutes more than an
hour hurtling down toward the atlantic
seaboard he found waycross here he
turned a little to the right and started
searching flying a hundred feet above
the mess of vegetation and black water
he had not deceived himself about the
	the blue book magazine

extent of his task the swamp was vast
he had divided his map into red-penciled
grids each one ten miles on a side and
now he started scouring across them

 it was wearing work he had the
constant mental hazard of the possibility
of motor failure he remembered a story
of a pilot forced down here who had
struggled futilely through waist-deep
muck for days only to die of exhaustion
and the murderous attacks of insects
the air was rough and the bumps
slammed joe constantly into his belt or
down into his seat battering his spine
his head ached from eyestrain and his
ears throbbed with the drumming of the
motor and after hours he had seen no
building in the swamp

  there were plenty of hummocks of dry
land where shacks could have been
built he passed a dozen islands barren
for the most part but for swamp grass
and sparse timber on one such place
he found an old abandoned camp the
ashes of the fires black with age as
he moved farther from the outer per-
imeter of the swamp the country be-
came wilder and wild fowl rose in
frenzied confusion as he passed here
long lanes of deep water separated the
shallow pools that had become a filthy
green with decaying vegetation he saw
black bear and deer as well as smaller
animals in a basin of smooth water an
alligator progressed sluggishly appear-
ing to push a great v-shaped ripple for-
ward with its nose

by mid-morning he had covered the
north end of the swamp he had found
one shack too old and dilapidated to
house any living soul beyond that
there had been nothing-and his gas was
etting low and he must be going on to
acksonville for more he was losing
hope

  and then on a low narrow hummock
that was brownish green with swamp
grass he saw a cabin partially concealed
behind some pines

  in sharp excitement he turned enough
to keep the nose from blocking his vision
focusing his binoculars with trembling
fingers he saw enough to give substance
to wild hope the shack was almost hid-
den in the trees and the swamp grass
was high on the west side of the hum-
mock where a few planks and stakes
improvised a landing at this landing
drawn up in the grass almost out of
sight joe saw a dugout from this boat
to the shack was a fresh-trampled path

  his heart was pounding as he tabu-
lated evidence there was a faint wisp
of smoke trailing from the sheet-iron
stack at the north end of the cabin a
pile of refuse lay near by joe eased the
plane into a shallow dive and it swept
past with incredible rapidity clearing
the low eave by scarcely fifty feet

as it did a girls figure appeared sud-
 denly in the doorway one slim arm
lifted to attract attention -a pale-faced
girl dressed in c blue evening gown that
was as incongruous in that setting as
the girl herself and instantly a man
appeared beside her and snatched her
violently from view

  a kind of dread excitement foamed
over joe in waves he had been so sure
until this moment thathe would land on
the hummock and go to sylvias assist-
ance once he found her he wanted to
do that but now recognized the folly of
it if he flew straight on out of sight
the kidnapers m ight assume that he was
a transient flyer lost in weather-and
would not suspect that their hideout had
been found but sylvia having recog-
nized his plane would be heartened by
the knowledge that he would soon return
with aid so lie reasoned he must go
on to jacksonvi lle and call dan paulling
on the telephone

  looking back across the tail he fixed
that scene in memory the hummock
was in no great way different from most
ridges of muck and earth in the deep
swamp its width was perhaps a hundred
yards its length a half a mile there
were few trees and all of them were
concentrated in a grove in which the
shack was snuggled the remainder of
the hummock was completely overgrown
with grass

  as joe saw all this again the plane
was hurtling through misty air at two
hundred feet a second he got only a
glimpse and already the island merging
with the murk behind had taken on the
sameness of a thousand similar places

  he snatched up his grid map to mark
the location there and he discovered in
a thin dismay that he wasnt sure enough
of his location now to make the mark

  swiftly he circled to the right with
narrowed glances he tried to match the
points of reference in the swamp to the
grid marks and the map he couldnt
do it he wheeled there in a taut haste
desperate but it wasnt any use

  the swamp reached out on every side
merging with the mist and clouds trem-
the lair in the swamp



 l

what you down here for lange muttered
you better tell me all about it kid-dont
hold back nothing see

mm

bling joe realized that there was but
one thing left to do he could get out
of the swamp easily enough by flying
southward but he would never find
this spot again in time yet he could
find it again now if he turned back ex-
actly along the flight path he had fol-
lowed coming down this far he could
get back to it now whereas he never
would be able to find it again if he went
much farther

  with a resolute recklessness he turned
the lockheed back

 what he meant to do w hen he did get
back he tried to decide quickly of
course barring a miracle he was going
to have to crash the plane there was
danger enough in that but it was not
now his great concern he wasnt sure
that by going back hed be helping sylvia
-for single-handed he could not hope
to cope with both her kidnapers even
if he survived the crash unhurt even if
they did not recognize him as sylvias
escort and he had a chance to take them

by surprise force would prove futile
in what he hach to do so he must
abandon thoughts of force and resort to
strategy it would be best to appear
unarmed he left the  there in its
pocket it would appear better if he
seemed hopelessly lost doggedly he held
his maps out in the propeller blast

  through the mist ahead he caught
sight of the shack again with a smooth
coordinated haste he put the wheels
down tightened his belt raised his gog-
gles and cut off the gas sliding down
into his slide-


the blue book magazine

  he leveled off head out in the blast
he could not see clearly the two men who
had come running from the shack but
what he did see clearly was that sud-
denly his windshield starred before his
face and a small round hole appeared

  wildly startled he gunned the motor
meaning to climb back into the clouds
but even as he slapped the throttle open
the engine starved out and the muttering
exhaust became a hollow pulsing whistle
as the propeller windmilled the plane
mushed heavily without the thrust of the
motor to hold its speed it pancaked-hard

  there was a dull crunching of wheel
struts and the hiss of swamp grass being
mowed down joe hauled the stick back
in his stomach and tried to brace himself
to take the blow he fought to keep the
tail down but it came up despite the
taut controls

  then for a reason he never under-
stood the plane hit solid ground and de-
celerated evenly and the tail came down
again it thumped into the grass and
after ten feet more of roll the lockheed
halted the propeller exactly horizontal

  reaction came over joe in little spurts
he remembered to breathe and his
diaphragm was a dull ache that slowly
dissipated he stood up in the cockpit
waving at the men to let them know he
wasnt armed for they were approach-
ing eyes narrowed in a cold estimate

  he said voice unsteady in spite of his
effort at an urbane nonchalance hello
had a forced landing got myself lost
and just about ran out of gas

the two stopped ten yards away
their rifles in a ready position in the
crooks of their arms their faces mirror-
ing murderous suspicion but no trace of
recognition one was tall with a thin
face and shrewd blue eyes the other
was of shorter build with a mouth that
had no visible lips a straight slash in a
reckless countenance

  climb out of there you said this
latter one he lurched forward through
the swamp grass with a quick nervous
stride gun ready lange you take him
to the shack im going to have a look
around his plane

  the man called lange came up more
slowly a definite caution in the smooth
looseness of his movements he said
why take him there dorn dont as-
sume things till you find them out   
stranger whats your business here
joe marvin outwardly completely
calm swung his legs to the fuselage

steps never taking eyes from lange
estimating boh men in swift frag-
mentary appraisals he decided that
dorn was in command joe said

  when you run out of gas in one of
these chariots youve got to come down
i saw your place so i came back to it
im in the swamp somewhere i know
but im about as lost a i ever want to
be how far is jacksonville

dorn took a step forward with cas-
ual ease get down he said in-
finite suspicion shone from his cold gray
eyes youre in the middle of the swamp
dont you know what that means

  with a forced indifference joe re-
turned it means im going to have a
hell of a long trip back to anywhere i
guess

  lange said with a quietness that made
joe shiver we wouldnt try to tell
you different son

  joe tried to laugh it was without
humor a flat cackling sound he stood
there a moment longer trying to marshal
some cogency to thought the wind was
whispering around his head as he clung
to the fuselage helmet in hand a thin
drizzle fell from leaden clouds soothing
the fire of his cheeks with its clammy
dampness from this position a few
feet above the level of the swamp the
shack hidden irt the scrawny pines could
not be seen swamp grass was a brown
waste across the hummock to the east
a lane of black water blended without
life or motion to the green scum of a
shallow pond and beyond that a quarter
of a mile away gaunt cypress merged
vaguely with the grayness of the day
spanish moss draped dismally from
every branch

  youre having tough weather for a
fishing trip joe said with elaborate
courtesy looking directly at dorn he
stepped down into the wet depth of the
dead grass with these men he must af-
fect curiosity without inquisitiveness he
had no illusions about what they in-
tended he glanced for an instant at
the windshield of the plane or perhaps
im mistaken about this being a fishing
expedition he added dryly agreeable
but im not a g-man looking for stills
so theres no occasion either for the guns
now or for the shot you took at me as
i came in to land he tried to read
their suspicious predatory faces but was
unable to at any rate im cold and
im getting we and im hungry must
we keep on standing here 
the lair in the swamp	

  whats your name dorn growled
youre free and easy with the gab

  joe told him coolly watching the
shifting gleam in dorns small eyes the
mans face showed nothing lange his
clothes becoming damp said impatiently
come on son dorn you look at that
airplane if you want but im going back
this heres a problem we hadnt counted
on he shifted his riflii to the crook of
his arm again the muzzle at joes loin
moving with that same loose-muscled
easy caution dorn turned away circling
the plane cursing the wt leg-entangling
grass

  leaving dorn there they threshed
through grass toward he cabin the
earth was a hard peat-like muck fairly
dry under the superficial wetting of this
drizzling rain but for the grass joe
thought he might be able to take off in
the lockheed once more-if he could con-
trive the chance

feeling the impersonal watchful-
ness of langes eyes upon his back
joe said with derision you and dorn
are impressive-guns and mystery and
all am i a dangerous character or is
this that kind of country 

 what you down here for lange
muttered his legs scissoring audibly
me i aim to live and let live-but
dorn hes a hard one hed a put a
hole in you you better tell me all about
it kid-dont hold back nothing see 

  i told you joe said outwardly with-
out mistrust he wanted to turn and
study langes thin features but he didnt
dare i ran out of gas or was just
about to run out i was lost this is a
big swamp and i knew if i cracked up
away from help id probably never get
out alive-so i came back to the last
place id seen that looked like people
lived there isnt that simple enough
maybe so for me said lange but
dorn-i aint saying what dorns going
to do	

  they walked on the whisking of their
trousers in the grass the only sounds ex-
cept when lange grunted a direction to
turn right or left as yet although joe
knew it could not be far ahead he had
caught no glimpse of the cabin from the
ground the cunning of its conceal-
ment explained probaby why no one
had discovered it before

  head around them palmettos lange
ordered curtly

  beyond the palmettos joe caught
sight of the shack pines shadowed it

to which it matched its chameleon gray-
brown taking no definite shape because
the tree-trunks supplied a natural camou-
flage but as he drew nearer joe
searched out its details it was built
of logs and shingled with shakes there
was a porch that faced the east un-
screened against mosquitoes it was
surprising how obscure and small it had
looked from the air

  they came to the porch no one was
in sight behind the doorway joe
stopped now his pulse unsteady at the
thought of facing sylvia behind him
lange called out in a voice not loud but
penetrating john 

  after a momentary interval of silence
a figure deepened the gloom of the door-
way and emerged upon the porch this
man was heavy through the chest with
incredibly broad shoulders about which a
faded hunting-coat fitted loosely age
lay in loose wrinkles on his cheeks puck-
ering his eyes which were deep blue and
almost serenely still he must have
been seventy joe thought yet he moved
across the porch with a compact ease

  hows the girl lange spoke with
a blunt violence that carried an im-
pact joe half turned involuntarily and
caught langes shrewd eyes fastened on
his face

  it seemed to him that he could not
wait for johns slow answer dread
thoughts ripped at his poise but he as-
sumed that same derisive smile and held
his tongue as langes eyes searched out
his features carefully

  still here john said laconically he
thrust open the door and held it with
resigned indifference stepping up onto
the porch joe sensed a submerged yet
watchful hostility between these men
the old man had a wary submissiveness
which at the same time seemed to hold a
stubborn disapproval

  come into the shack kid lange
said with a soft ominous tone i want
to talk to you    john you got coffee
and anything to eat

  coffee john returned equably fol-
lowing them into the main room of the
cabin i can fry ye up some eggs
lange cursed eggs and fish is
that all the food you ever knew well
hurry up with it dorn will be here
pretty soon

john moved in silent thoughtfulness
into the hallway joe looked about
the room finding it amazing there
was a radio on a table by the east win-


the blue book magazine

in the doorway appeared suddenly a girl
dressed in an evening gown-as incongruous
in that setting as the girl herself

dow on the floor a grass rug gave
a look of permanence pictures on the
walls were of varied types from an etch-
ing of a fog-bound schooner on a wind-
less sea to a pen-and-ink sketch of a
famous comic strip character auto-
graphed by its creator this background

for men like lange and dorn seemed
utterly incongruous but the comic
strip joe saw a moment later was auto-
graphed to john

  sitting there joe tried to understand
johns true place in this crime the old
man looked like a swamp trapper or a
prosperous guide why was he harbor-
ing lange and dorn and furnishing his
place as a hide-out for kidnapers it
seemed unreasonable

  lange sst down by the radio tamped
a cigarette and held a match to it be-
hind the cloud of smoke his voice was
casual whats the news outside kid
joe spurned the bait what do you
mean-the news outside dont you get
outside yourself  you dont look like
a native trapper

  all the news we get is through the
radio-and that aint much i like to
hear whats going on when im down
here fishing whats happened-in at-
lanta

  joe tried to analyze the motive for that
question fitting it into the facts he knew
then he had it if the ransom had been
paid wouldnt he say so if lange could
draw him out enough for him to mention
the kidnaping it had not been put on
the air he sa d vaguely im out of
atlanta most of the time-flying noth-
ing happening that i know of

he could sense the dissatisfaction in
langes manner but the man said
no more old john came in silently and
put dishes on the rough-hewn table at
the south end of the living-room he
moved with a massive smoothness that
denied his age his hands sure in their
work his eyes lifting with occasional
fleeting direct glances at lange then he
said in that equable soft drawl hit aint
much but if ye e hongry come an set
they sat down in bent-wood chairs to
a lunch of fried eggs and hard toast
fried black bass fried potatoes coffee
lange eating sullenly remarked to
john if id throw away that skillet of
yours wed sure starve he turned on
joe marvin with a swift intensity
listen he said jabbing with his fork
for emphasis when the weather gets
better can you take off again in that
plane of yours from where it is

  wondering what was in langes mind
joe waited while he boned a fish then
he said evenly i told you i landed be-
cause i was almost out of gas

  i mean lange said with his mouth
full if you had more gas
the lair in the swamp



  that depends on the load id have to
carry

 two people-three people-me and
dorn and a-another party

joe realized that the other party
must be sylvia he probably could
not take the plane off through that
swamp grass by itself hed never get
it off the ground with three people in its
large front cockpit bat the suggestion
was a spark that fired his brain to a
more plausible idea-the only one so
far which seemed to hold any real prom-
ise of success perhaps he could get
dorn and lange and john to help him
clear a runway for the take-off and then
if his luck held he night contrive to
get sylvia alone in the plane perhaps at
night there was a full moon now

  the idea burned into his mind of
course the obstacles were vast and the
danger could not be underestimated yet
he knew the infinite peril sylvia and he
were in already and such a bold move
would not increase their danger much

  keeping all trace of excitement even
of interest from his tone he said with
gasoline i might be able to but theres
going to be a lot to do ill have to
check the runway and well have to clear
it enough to let the plane get speed
after thats done well see how much
gasoline we can take aboard and still get
off it will be a risk ir any case

  as he ceased speaking the screen door
slammed and dorn sialked into the
room with heavy tread the thin scar
of his mouth was lifted at one corner in
a sardonic twitching smile his gray eyes
were brightly cold as he tossed joes 
down upon the table with a crash

  just a schoolboy lost in the swamp
eh his deep voice was coarse with a
stinging mockery he sat down opposite
joe and his nervous fingers took up the
weapon once more muzzle aimed di-
rectly at joes throat he toyed with it
thumbing the hammer back ahd letting
it slip forward you tetter talk fast
he rasped

  joe felt his cheeks go numb not
quite a schoolboy he said with a forced
painful leisure i always carry the
gun in case of fire-in case i have a
forced landing-

  smart guy dorn gru nted he turned
icy gray eyes on old john then seemed
to reconsider what he was about to say
scraping back his chair he stalked down
the hallway toward the kitchen the gun
still in his hand

  in the hushed tension of that room
joe searched langes strict face for a
sign of what might come but found no
clue old john sat at his place fur-
tively watchful fork poised absolutely
motionless from the rear of the cabin
dorns rude voice sounded in an under-
tone and then irregular footsteps re-
traced their way along the hall-two
people coming quickly

  still wearing that long evening gown
sylvia came into the room a moment
later her presence adding volatility to
an atmosphere already explosive fright
was in her wide blue eyes from the
rigidity of her laced fingers joe marvin
understood the violence of the strain
she had been undergoing yet to lange
and dorn she must have seemed suffi-
ciently poised a tall proud silent girl

  she undoubtedly knew joe had come
back and landed the motors noise
must have reached this cabin in the
pines so she was prepared to see him
yet as their eyes met he saw the invol-
untary interruption of the posed serenity
of her entrance shock showed in the
delicate flaring of her nostrils her eyes
widened almost imperceptibly and her
lips parted with a quick breath that was
checked in its beginning

  it was so imperative that she show no
sign of recognition looking at her with
an impersonal blankness yet trying to
bridge space with reassuring thought
joe saw her pull herself back to a spuri-
ously disinterested composure she came
in and took a seat at the table end

  dorn sat down

  you two dont know each other
dorn inquired with feigned affability
both being from atlanta- his frigid
eyes traveled over sylvias face with a
speculative patience then swung to joe
miss-jackson this is mr marvin he
was flying over and decided to-drop in

  lange chuckled harshly in his throat
old john got up and moved placidly
into the kitchen

  charmed joe murmured feeling the
pressure of dorns suspicion

  how do you do sylvia returned
and lowered her eyes

silence fell distrustfully upon the
group joe lifted a glass of water
to his lips and knew his hand was trem-
bling visibly but nobody seemed to no-
tice him now old john came back with
hot biscuits and wild honey audibly
rain dripped from the eaves to the pools
in the muck earth the chilling north
	the blue book magazine

wind whined over the chimney billow-
ing fog rolled across the swamp obliter-
ating the outlines of near-by cypress and
pines and as dorn and lange ate rav-
enously joe came to know that he was
momentarily safe dorn was relaxing se-
cure in the belief that there was no con-
nection between this kidnaped girl and
the man who had come back to land

  with swift reassuring glances at syl-
via joe made desperate plans he could
tramp down the grass enough to impro-
vise some sort of runway he believed
there was sufficient gasoline in the tanks
of the lockheed to reach jacksonville
and even without more than enough gas
to get out of the swamp it would be bet-
ter to get out with sylvia and take a
chance than to stay here

if he merely waited for a chance to
overpower dorn and lange and old
john it might require days he consid-
ered with an harassed impatience he
had lost his only weapon recourse to
rough-and-tumble fighting was impracti-
cal-impossible in fact he had never
engaged in such a fight in all his life
yet thinking in a grim concentration
on the matter he knew he must do some-
thing quickly tonight probably dan
paulling would try again to make con-
tact with the pay-off man if he suc-
ceeded then that individual would pre-
sumably come at once to this hide-out
or would communicate in some way and
it should follow that sylvia would quick-
ly be released

  but would she be joe in a gathering
distrust did not believe she would
these men were completely ruthless
dorn could not possibly have known who
was in the plane a while ago-yet he had
fired at the pilot with intent to kill
lange-or at least a member of the band
-had stood beside the car in atlanta
and coolly acknowledged the necessity
for killing joe because joe had caught
sight of the driver of the car and syl-
via had seen the driver and now knew
lange and dorn as well so her death
would eliminate the risk of eventual
recognition just as much as joes own
would the more joe thought about it
the more convinced he was that not only
he but sylvia as well was marked for
death the instant the ransom had been
paid he felt desperate trapped as he
recognized the irrefutable logic of that
reasoning

  again as he had done when he first
came into the building he searched the

interior of the room there was a sheet-
iron wood stove in the north end fire
dying in it now a stack of split pine
lay beside it the lengths perhaps fifteen
or twenty inches long

  joe settled back in his chair appar-
ently relaxing jl he wanted was a slim
chance and he suddenly thought he
saw it

  you look cold he said to sylvia
his voice sounding with a kindly but im-
personal interest ill shake up the
fire

  her lips trembled faintly as she looked
at him he thought he had never seen
anyone look so tired-or so beautiful

  i am-cold he murmured please
do

  he wondered if she sensed what he
meant to attempt

  dorn said harshly johnll do the fire

  but joe marvin was already on his
feet moving without evident haste to-
ward the low woodpile he selected a
pine stick a little larger than his wrist
and laid it to one side upon the stack
writh elaborate care he stoked the fire
then knowing full well that this was
either death or freedom he was courting
he picked up the tough pine cluband
holding it casually hidden by his right
leg he moved back toward the table

  sylvia facing the fire from the far end
of the table saw him coming saw the
stick and sensed his intent her wan
face froze her eyes darkly alive with a
bright dread dorn seated at her left
had been beside joe lange was across
the table from dorn and old john was
beside lange

dorn was the man joe feared and in
removing dorn he hoped to get that
 which was now resting in the leaders
belt lange was dangerous enough but
lange did not possess the killers instinct
dorn so flauntingly displayed old john
was an unknown in the equation but the
man was aged and apathetic enough to
be slow in reaction to attack

  joe almost ret ched a position behind
dorn his motive undiscovered when
lange yelled a raucous warning dorn
-behind you  get that-

  dorn turned a  the moment joe swung
the club it glanced off dorns skull
with a dull thluck striking downward to
his shoulder in the ensuing violence
dorn rose from his chair throwing the
table forward catching lange and old
john off their balance so that they fell
backward in their chairs sylvia strug-
the lair in the swamp



gled to her feet her face clouded with
shocked fear she put up her hands as
if to fend off the assailants and stepped
backward screaming

  joe-the gun 

  joe marvin had no time to look to see
the gun he was battering at dorn with
short chopping blows that had no per-
ceptible effect dorn oif balance had
gone to the floor on hands and knees
and had started to come up again all
the time joe struck at him but dorns
weaving form was difficult to hit and no
blow was a solid one

then as dorns head came up the
mans face dark with blood and a
murderous hatred joe raised the club
and smashed him hard on the temple
dorn dropped like a pole-iixed steer and
just then the gun behind joe spoke
thunderously across the room

  the spitting yellow burst of it was in
joes eyes against the gloom of the cloudy
afternoon he felt no impact of the
bullet so he knew lange must have
missed but no one covld miss again
at such close range dropping flat he
took scanty shelter behind the upturned
table and tried to inch his way across
the three feet of space that separated
him from dorn once he got that 
he would cope with lange

  crawling there he cursed his inability
to accelerate his movements he reached
dorns side and tried to find the gun
but dorn was lying on his face the gun
under him his body had the limpness
of a corpse the shoulders turned without
changing the position of the hips joe
strained to turn dorn over on his back
he couldnt do it holding dorns shoul-
der off the floor with one hand he ex-
plored swiftly with the other

  all the time spaced shots were crash-
ing from across the room through joes
desperate thoughts ran the incredulous
realization that it was impossible for a
man to miss as often as lange had
missed-and yet so far he was not hit
the detonations came irregularly the
gaps between them filled with sylvias
warning screams it all seemed unreal
out the pungent reek of turned powder
he impact of each explosion was real
enough yet joe felt no conscious fear
excitement was in his veins like a vapor-
ous fluid volatile as ether driving him
on he knew he must hurry and he
cnew he had lost his chance to achieve
what had been impossible all the time
jut he was not afraid

  tugging at dorns yielding body he
found the hard butt of the  he
snatched it free relief an actual physical
sensation pivoting on his knees he
turned to fire a shot at lange

  the gun came up in his hand with
agonizing sluggishness visual impres-
sions came across the room with an
impacting force he checked his tighten-
ing finger just in time-when he realized
sylvia was standing between himself and
lange she was clawing at the man
while he tried both to fling her to one
side and shoot at joe that explained
why all of langes shots had been going
so wild

  crouching there under the scanty pro-
tection of the table waiting to get in a
shot without endangering sylvia joe
tried to locate old john the white-
haired man was nowhere to be seen nor
had he been in evidence since this melee
started then joe forgot him lange
had cuffed sylvia to one side with his
elbow and had taken snap-shot aim and
fired the bullet plucked at joes shoul-
der just as he himself threw in a shot
he couldnt tell whether it was effective
sylvia was back there fighting trying to
hold lange off the moment joe had
waited for had come and passed

  he raised himself into a crouch ready
to leap across and engage the other hand-
to-hand he couldnt risk another shot
with sylvia weaving in and out between
himself and lange tensing the muscles
of his right leg he came up gradually
intent upon timing his attack he did not
see dorn stir and open his eyes and esti-
mate the situation in a swift survey it
puzzled him and enraged him when
lange threw down his gun and grabbed
sylvia by the shoulders and swung her
into his line of fire if he had looked
behind him he would have seen dorn
rising to his feet unsteadily gun in hand
and he would have known that it was
dorns fire lange was trying to avoid
if dorn missed joe

  but as it was through the smoke and
dull light joe could not see the focus
of langes eyes and he never felt
dorns blow at all when the gun-butt
crashed down upon his skull

he awoke with the pain of that blow
still jerking at his nerves his head
felt bursting a sweetish taste of pow-
der lay deep in his throat when he swal-
lowed and there was a great roaring in
his ears beyond the roaring he could
hear dorn saying in an utterly relent-

less pronouncement of course im go-
ing to rub the so-and-so out right now
by god but im not going to do it
here hes going into the swamp where
the hell is that old man i need help
and youve got to stay with the moll
what time is it

  twelve oclock said lange just
about time for the news broadcast he
sounded excited but underneath the ex-
citement he sounded upset dont be
a damn fool dorn you dont have to
kill him- he paused interrupted by
sylvias hysterical sobbing joe heard
his heavy spaced footsteps crossing the
far side of the room and his voice came
again more softly that wont do you
no good id untie you sister but you
scratched my face

  but let me see if hes hurt sylvia
sobbed and her voice trailed away

  dorns steely cold voice grated gag
her dammit do something to stop that
sniveling

 lange moved across the room and
then back take it easy cant you
sister do you want a towel in your
face

  the sobbing ceased lange went on
to dorn the thing to do is get out of
here with the dame leave this guy in
the shack hell come around pretty
soon hell have to walk out of the
swamp see-only hell never get out

the airplane-somebodyll find it and
theyll think he landed at this shack and
found nobody and tried to walk out so
we wont have that on us but we got to
move out o here quick-and a murder
wont do any-

why we got to move dorn demand-
ed sullenly

because somebodyll be looking for
this guy when he doesnt show up in his

youre a fool to do murder when it aint
necessary when its necessary-

  you bucking me lange dorn chal-
lenged with a deadly calm am i run-
ning this snatch and are you taking
orders were gonna bump this guy
see

  silence slid over the room heavy with
irresolution joe marvin opened his
eyes and found that he was lying by the
upturned table on the floor he could
see dorn from the spill of his vision
dorn had a bloddy handkerchief around
his head and was pacing back and forth
between the hallway and the porch door
lange was sitting by the radio now his
the lair in

thin face pinched with strain and inde-
cision sylvia was out of sight and joe
did not call attention to himself by turn-
ing his head

  the dry throbbing of that pain in his
head sucked at hi vitality confusing
thought but he knew that he was
trapped there wes no hope for him
no matter what they did with sylvia
dorn would brook no opposition from
lange and lange lacked the force of
character to uphold his convictions

  yet in the time still left to him he
searched for a means of frustrating dorn
given enough time he might with pa-
tience gain some slim opportunity but
he knew that dorn was going to act
quickly when that action came the
small furious burst of desperation left
in joe would avail nothing

at langes side the radio erupted a
 slur of static followed by a mellow
gong and then a sing-song voice that
said wsb-the atlanta journal at-
lanta georgia the journal covers dixie
like the dew the voice grew crisp and
faintly nasal news flashes of the day

the swamp	

sylvia paulling kidnaped daughter of
dan paulling atlanta millionaire has
not been ransomed yet the intermedi-
ary twice has failed to meet paulling at
the rendezvous to receive the money
joe marvin friend of the family took
off this morning in his own plane in an
effort to locate sylvia in the depths of
the okefenokee swamp airport attaches
have made known he has been gone
more than two hours beyond the limit
of his fuel supply and as yet is unre-
ported fearing he is down in the
swamp searching parties are leaving at-
lanta immediately by air to comb the
area the hide-out of the ashley gang
has never been located in the past but
this time it is going to be officials prom-
ise    flash rome italy   
italian legions are marching again to-
day- the radio went off abruptly as
lange turned the volume down

  dorn had stopped at the doorway of
the porch his breathing audible in the
intense quiet which had followed that
announcement he stared out across
the dismal mist-blurred swamp and
suddenly whirled back to lange the
recklessness of his hard face exaggerated
by the bright fierceness of his eyes

can you tie that he snarled this
guy come down here by hisself-meant
to find us all the time he came over
and stirred joe with his foot listen
you-howd you find us

joe sat up slowly holding his head
with both hands the pain was terrible
he wondered if his skull were fractured
then realized that it made no difference
he opened his eyes wider fighting the
pain and met dorns gaze

you cant see this shack from the
level of the swamp but you can from
the air i kept looking till i found it

   was clawing at
lange that explained
why his shots had gone
so wild joe crouched
under the scanty protec-
tion of the table waiting
to get in a shot without
endangering sylvia


the blue book magazine

  dorns square face took on an unac-
customed look of doubt he stalked
across the room youre right he said
violently to lange they never found
us before because they never hunted us
with airplanes before well have to
move fast but the punk-he stays right
here he stirred his big frame into
a quick stride toward the hallway call-
ing john there was no answer

  joe looked across at sylvia wrists and
ankles bound with a light cord sitting
in a bent-wood chair beside the window
she looked badly frightened yet under-
neath that was a deathless courage he
sent her a quick smile across the room
and she tried bravely to smile back at
him he forced back a desperate temp-
tation to launch a fresh attack on lange
he must wait    painfully he got up
and limped to a chair and sank into it

from the rear of the shack a door
banged shuffling feet came in their
sound mingled with the voluble abuse
which dorn was heaping on old john

  the rat thought hed grab the dugout
and fix us so we couldnt get out o the
swamp dorn explained in a furiously
sharp rage he reached out and twist-
ed the faded collar of johns hunting-
coat tight around his wrinkled throat
damn you i ought to throw your car-
cass to the alligators wheres a good
hide-out weve got to scram-tonight
-before night-now

  old john sat there as if numb while
fear stiffened his lips hit dont make
no difference about me he mumbled
what happened to my ben

  yeah  sneered lange what did
happen to him the radio just said he
aint collected nothing yet this guy
marvin found us with a airplane and
theres others looking for him with air-
planes-and theyll find him so we
gotta scram well rub ben out when
we find him-thats whats going to hap-
pen to that rat

  old john looked down at his gnarled
hands laced finger over finger in his lap
his face showed nothing a minute
passed and then slowly he underwent
a strange transition some violent im-

crisoned emotion set his lips to trem-
ling his voice took on a shrill hope-
less desperation hit aint like ben
he protested ye forged a killin on
him that he never done-ye forced me
to harbor ye i never had no trust for
either of ye-and thiss moren i cain
tolerate im old i been a honest trap-

per do what yere a mind-but i be
done with all o ye his voice broke

  dorn listened him out and laughed
with cold malice bens in with us
he said indifferently one word from us
and ben gets the hot-squat for this job
old man youd better take us out o here
-and fast

  old john only sat there apathetically
looking across the swamp his mouth
was pinched and bitter weariness lined
his cheeks tumping them gray but the
resistance he had kicked before came
now with sudden violence

  ye can murder me and murder ben if
yere so minded-but i aint takin ye
nowhere he said firmly

  joe marvin sensed the subtle change
in dorn and lange and that change
made him think of something they
were city men and without johns help
they were trapped in his morass of wild-
erness john knew ihe waterways and
trails so they could not destroy him
without bringing almost certain destruc-
tion to themselves lange knew that
and dorn must know it too

  but the scheme joe considered as
he sat there with his head throbbing
from that pistol-blow was the possibil-t
ity of using his airplane as a weapon
the risk to himself would be tremendous
but it was a slim chance and all he
wanted was a slim chance danger to
himself he discounted as things stood
he was as good as dsad for he would
be dead before the night wore on

  if youve got to get out of here he
said to dorn showing no great interest
maybe i can fly you cut theres thirty
minutes gas left in my tanks thats
enough to get beyond the swamp at
least-out to a highway

  dorn fastened cold suspecting eyes
upon him where youre going you
wont be any help he said curtly

  joe shrugged outwardly indifferent
my plane will be spotted from the air
the clouds are lifting and the fog is
thinning out by the time you get
started in a boat therell be somebody
searching this vicinity ill njake a deal
with you to try to tak you out

lange pursed wary lips what do
j you mean 

  leave miss paullin here with john
ill fly you to the emergency field at
folkston-fifty miles-where you can
get a car you go your way and i go
mine-ill forget i ever saw you in my
life
the lair in

  dorn snorted and leave go a hun-
dred-grand doll nix we take her
and we keep her punk

  joe shook his head fighting the pain
weighing his arguments he had so few
that would appeal to men like dorn and
lange and then suddenly he saw
their weakness cupidity had brought
them this far and cupidity might take
them on to their undoing he said
smoothly mr paulling has been trying
for two days to pay the ransom but he
couldnt make contact with your pay-off
man it will be some time before john
can get miss paulling out of the swamp
-you know that by that time you two
can get to atlanta and collect the ran-
som yourselves-and leave the pay-off
man out of it entirely

dorns crafty eye narrowed in an
appreciative speculation confront-
ing him joe felt keerly his distrust of all
humanity dorn grated theres plenty
g-men might be waiting at this folk-
ston you might fly us to atlanta and
dump us in their lap

  with a taunting derision joe returned
havent you got guns to see to that 
because your pay-off man has lost his
nerve are you both losing yours dont
worry about my lane ing you at folkston
if i get you off the ground at all he
paused watching them langes face
mirrored his indecision dorn was wor-
rying at this tempting bait hope
surged violently in joe looking at
john trying to judge how much he could
trust the old man with the care of
sylvia he found that wrinkled face se-
rene and reassuring

  it sounds too easy dorn grumbled
it aint right-i got a feeling it aint
right lange but we gotta git out o
here he made a nervous circle of the
room feet sounding harshly on the rough
pine floor he seemed to have forgotten
sylvia the threats he made at old john
while ago pinning his narrowed glance
on joes smooth indifferent countenance
he suddenly drew that  from his belt
and deftly balanced it in his hand all
right punk he said with a dangerous
sibilance lets get out of here but
remember-one move-and you get a
quick slug through the belly

  joe disregarded their impatience he
crossed the room to sylvia loosening her
bonds with swift tenderness her voice
was urgent joe be careful darling i
wish we could go back together-i wish
you didnt have to jo-alone

the swamp	

  he thought sharply about what he
planned to do out at the end of the
hummock in the deep swamp as he
considered what might happen there a
kind of smothering breathlessness came
over him and his cheeks felt stiff it
was time for him to go but he couldnt
go yet thrusting back all thought of
the future living to the fullness of this
moment he fought at the emotion which
ripped through him i adore you he
murmured with a tense gentleness al-
ways he took her into his arms and
her kiss was fervent with surrender

  they marched back to the hummock
joe leading dorn and lange following
single file the sky was still leaden with
low scudding clouds and mist slanted
into the swamp grass while the chill wind
brushed across their heads considering
the ceiling joe realized that there would
be no break in the weather for some
hours if this plan of his failed every-
thing would fail with it life would come
to an end with that failure but he must
not he could not fail

  the lockheed was standing as he had
left it pausing at the wing he looked
north measuring the length of the hum-
mock with practised eye estimating the
length of the runway he said well
have to tramp down the grass as much
as we can so the ship can get speed
and i want to walk down to the end of
the hummock and step off the distance

  dont try no stall dorn warned
suspiciously

  joe laughed at that perennial distrust
appearing to count his steps he paced
through the grass his trousers whisking
noisily grass seeds and moisture cov-
ered his garments to his hips the chill
wind turned him cold but he paid no
attention to discomfort

in his mind he was feeeing again a day
when he had been a cadet at kelly
field on solo stage he was seeing a
dh come in slowly for a landing an in-
structor in the rear cockpit a student in
the front one the plane landed high and
pancaked hard-and the landing gear
gave way as the ship nosed over briskly
the thing that stuck in joe marvins
busy mind was the remembrance of see-
ing the figure of the instructor sail out
of the rear cockpit in a perfect parabola
and strike the ground and roll safely
from the vicious impact of the tail group
as it slammed over on the earth the
cadet in the front cockpit with his belt
tight about his thighs had stayed there
	the blue book magazine

as the plane crushed down upon the
fuselage-as smoke topped furiously out
of spreading dust

  so	now what joe sought was a place
to manufacture a similar disaster on
this hummock with dorn and lange
belted securely in the front cockpit of
this plane-while he unencumbered by
his belt was catapulted from the rear
one as the craft nosed over for dorn
and lange if joe chose his location care-
fully enough it would be certain cap-
ture for even if they were not hurt
they would be held prisoners in the for-
ward cockpit the opening closed against
the earth the weight of the whole air-
plane pinning them there until they were
released from the outside as for him-
self joe had seen too many planes nose
over not to know the danger but he
knew also the certainty with which the
plan would work he would be thrown
out if he left his belt loose-but whether
he would be hurt in being thrown out
was something which he would have to
leave to chance

  but if he could find a place where the
hummock slanted steeply to deep water
he would have a place to fall without
injury to himself the water needed to
be deep joes blood pulsed with a sus-
taining excitement

  dorn and lange paced with him
through the grass

  ahead of them the hummock sloped
gently into greenish scum that extended
half a dozen yards to a low muck bank
across the stream this place wouldnt
do the plane might not nose over
properly and there was no place for joe
to dive but he only said well need
to tramp more grass

  get a move on lange growled we
aint got all day

without reply joe swung back to-
ward the south he scanned the
hummock edge closely thinking that if
he found deep water there he might per-
haps swerve the plane in the take-off
run but there was no water deep
enough they passed the plane and went
toward the southern end of the grass-
covered strip of land while joe patient-
ly explained that he would have to start
the take-off run from there

  and there at the south end the water
ran deep and black past the low border
of the ground it was a hundred and
fifty feet from one bank to the other
this joe realized instantly was the
place where he must crash

  but tautly he debated the hazard of
that crash he would have to take off
downwind-from the north to the south
of the island-in order to plunge the
lockheed in this stream if either dorn
or lange knew anything of flying they
would suspect perhaps what he intend-
ed when he started in that final run
and even if they didnt the hazards of
doing it this way were desperate down-
wind the plane would nose over much
more violent joiis chances of coming
out alive were infinitely decreased he
might easily be stunned or even killed
when he was flung into the water if
he sustained any in ury he would not be
able to swim back to shore standing
at the brink he went over each element
of danger but it was the only way

as they tramped back to the plane
 joe watchful of their expressions
explained that perhaps the plane could
beat down the grass faster than they
could he said ml fire up you
get in and well taxi back and forth
when ive beaten down a runway ill
swing around and well take off he
waited in breathless anxiety while they
considered this proposal with customary
wariness dorn eased his gun around
where he could get it easily he said
okay punk he waited while lange
climbed into the cockpit on reconsid-
eration he held the automatic in his
hand and followed

  joe got in he pumped the primer
nervously alert in every sense the
pungent reek of gasoline was pleasant
to his nostrils somehow steadying to his
hands but inside him was a trembling
uncertainty which he could not over-
come the starter motor whined upward
through a grating octave as it leaped ten
thousand revvs joe jerked the clutch
and the prop arced over and the exhaust
emitted a blatant rosr

  for ten minutes he sat there his
mind was queerly accelerated waiting
for the thing to coire he thought of
sylvia and wondered how soon she and
old john would start through the swamp
in the dugout along the water trails he
wondered if old john would get her out
so she could telephone her father before
the ransom had been paid he won-
dered how he himseli would get out of
the swamp if they started now before
the crash-and he survived it then he

uit thinking he climbed out on the
uselage and reached down and fastened
the long belt securely around dorn and
the lair in

lange tightly so that it would hold
them fast no matter what the lockheed
struck and with a kind of numb single-
ness of purpose he climbed back to his
seat and blasted power to the engine

  they taxied down the grassy hum-
mock rocking on the inequalities of
ground at the end joe turned around
from the cabin now no sign of life was
visible there was no use waiting the
time to do this thing was here joe
checked the ends o his own belt to be
sure they would not tangle in his cloth-
ing as he catapulted and facing south
downwind he poured gun to the engine
all the way

  the lockheed bumped unsteadily
grass flew up in a brown spray from the
prop the wings whipped through the
stuff with a hollow singing sound they
accelerated with amazing quickness to
fifty miles an hour but no more than
that grass caught at the wings and
landing gear and the plane could not
have got off had joe wished it his
goggles off his eyes he was trying to see
ahead to judge the moment when he
must shove forward on the stick-as the
wheels plunged down into the water it
was funny to see dorn sitting there in
the spurious security of that forward
cockpit guarding against trickery try-
ing to imagine how surprised those two
were going to be joe tensed himself and
got one hand on he cowling as black
water showed up on both sides of the
nose

  his actions camt as a smooth sequence
of coordination after that he was
conscious of the flooding movement of
brown grass beneath the wings he was
conscious of amazement that they were
going to strike so quickly and so hard
and then like a horse stumbling at full
gallop the lockheeds wheels leaped
that little slope of ground-and sank in-
to the water joe shoved forward on the
stick and shoved forward on the cowl-
ing too the nose wenfdown the whole
thing sickeningly sudden yet not unex-
pected the prop was knifing water and
the engines noise was flooding past the
cockpit windshield with a kind of sub-
merged thunder while spray and grass
seemed to form a cloud there in the air

joe felt himself picked up gently and
propelled headfirst through space he
did not even realize that his cheek
had left a patch of skin upon the wind-
shield frame jackknifing he went up
and up and floated there for an incred-

the swamp	

ibly long time while under him was un-
substantial space and the blur of a red
airplane striking silver in the water
turning end for end joe got his hands
in front of him then the black blur hit
him in the face and he was half stunned
by the blow the icy coldness of that
impact was like a jolt of high voltage
and he couldnt get his breath but then
he kicked his way up from the bottom
and emerged behind him after he had
shaken water from his eyes debris and
grass were still settling in the air above
a furiously roiled area of the stream

  and in the center of the stream two
wheels were thrust up by the twin struts
of the landing gear no other portion
of the lockheed showed a slick of oil
was forming there amid a ghastly silence
that had echoed back across the gray
reaches of the dismal swamp

the dugout moved along the silent
water lane widening a v-shaped rip-
ple with its bow sylvia paulling sat
amidship riding forward joe marvin
rested in cross-legged discomfort facing
her he kept reliving the raw excite-
ment of that moment back there in the
sunken plane muscles tensing in reac-
tion still dorns cleverness in crime had
been based upon his natural distrust of
everyone around him but it had been his
ultimate undoing too if he had not
been so intently suspicious of what joe
meant to do after they got into the air
he might have seen what joe was trying
to do before they got into the air

  but joe tried to forget all that as he
watched sylvia she was lovely she
was looking at him shyly with a kind of
lambent radiance old john was behind
them standing upright in the stern
sphinx-like statuesque and tireless pol-
ing the dugout down this swamp trail
which he knew so intimately joe wished
something might be done for john and
he resolved to try

  as sylvia leaned forward and gently
touched his hand it seemed to joe that
life could never have been quite so full
without this frightful episode which had
awakened him to her the world was a
queer place no matter how dangerous
a situation was after it was past you
wouldnt wish to have had it changed
much for fear the whole course of your
life might also change    he smiled
at sylvia with a deep tenderness a deep
contentment while the boat slipped in
utter silence between ghostly cypresses

the distinguished author of strange woman the keys
of the city and morals for moderns hene contributes a
brief but unforgetable war-time drama

by elmer day i s

by midsummer of  the young
men had all gone away-all the
able-bodied ones e -ept those who
had families to support and silas
brumby nobody knew why si hadnt
enlisted he was a queer fellow with no
family no close friends he never talked
much except to the horses he took care
of at the livery-stable it was judge
woods who put it squarely up to him at
last-old judge woods who had fought
under harrison in 

  a big strong fellow like you si with
no home ties ought to be in the army

si	chewed on a straw and said nothing
you ride like a centaur the judge per-
sisted whatever that is thought
si youre better with horses you
know more about horses than any other
man in this town youre a born cavalry-
man    and dont you care about sav-
ing the union

  sure i do but id hate to kill any-
body judge-even a rebel

  you the judge-snorted why i
saw you half kill a man with your fists
last year on the courthouse square they
had to drag you off him

  he was beatin a horse si explained
a worn-out horse that couldnt have
pulled that dray out of the mud i hate
to see horses hurt

  i didnt hear the horse complaining
the judge muttered

  you wouldnt a horse he dont like
to be hurt but if he is hurt hell take
an awful lot without a whimper   
unless hes too bad hurt-

  si	shuddered there it came again
out of the depths of his memory-that
horrible scream like an enormously mag-
nified neigh but a cry of unendurable
agony fie couldnt have been more
than four years old when he heard that-

  the day old baldy slipped on the icy
bridge and plunged through the rail onto
the rocky ledge below but he never
would forget it   

  thered be a lot of that in a battle
said si uneasily horses gettin bad
hurt i mean i dont know as i could
stand it

  horses my god you dont think
theyre more human than people do
you  when men are getting hurt being
killed-

  i figure they askec for it judge but
the horses-it aint their war-nor even
their union so far as they know dont
seem fair for them to get hurt i hate
to think of it  si shuddered again

  hell said the judge disgusted
you hate to think of getting hurt your-
self more likely theyre talking of a
draft brumby to catch the men who
wont volunteer  i hope to god it
catches you

  and in due time it did

the first michigan had gone over the
guns in the road cutting down the
gray-clad gunners the seventh michigan
was trotting up in support sergeant
brumby peered vainly into the murk of
dust and smoke ahead but on the left the
air was clearer and between the trotting
ranks he caught a glimpse of long lines of
dismounted men advancing under fire
the rebels had stopped an attack up that
way earlier but this new general sheri-
dan didnt stay stopped  he was at them
again-and sergeant brumby at last
was in what you could call a real battle

  not that he hadnt seen plenty of
action-outpost skirmishes the raid to
charlottesville in the winter fighting
back there in the wilderness last week
plenty of action-and he hadnt minded

it half as much as he had expected the
whine of bullets was no fun of course
but pretty soon you were too busy to
think much about it and as for killing
-when a crowd of men in blue fired
their carbines or revolvers at a crowd of
men in gray how could you know who
had hit the men who fell  and the secret
horror that was lurking in his memory
had never been awakened yet si brum-
by had seen horses killed horses wound-
ed-but by bullets a horse could take
that it needed more than a bullet-
wound to evoke that shriek of agony

the trot quickened to a canter
sergeant brumbys revolver was out
ready his knees tightened on painters
flanks good old painter-the best horse
he had ever ridden the best friend he
had ever had it was painters alertness
and speed that had saved him last winter
when he ran into one of fitzhugh lees
patrols    hed need a good horse to-
day this was getting hotter from the
front came a heavier burst of firing the
screeching rebel yell another screech
a shell flew overhead exploding a little
way behind him he saw a puff of smoke
floating away from the gun that had fired
it across the fields and now toward
the right flank where sergeant brumby
rode a straggling crowd of horsemen in
gray came galloping firing as they came

  he pointed his revolver at the crowd
fired again and again so did others
the men in gray-not so many after all
-checked their horses firing into the
flank of the blue column ds it galloped
past brumby saw an officer with a flow-
ing bronze beard heard his silvery voice
even above the firing give it to them
boys give it to them

	up ahead something was wrong the
column slowed down ranks crowded
ranks horse jostling horse the first
had been struck by a countercharge was
being pushed back the press grew thick-
er men began to turn their horses the
whole column was drifting toward the
rear sergeant brumby drew painter
aside out of the jam now a man could
see where he was what he could do-

  a terrific concussion he was pitched
headlong over painters neck and hit
the ground so hard that for an instant
he lay stunned and then he came back
to consciousness-the shuddering con-
sciousness of a four-year-old child sud-
denly aware of undreamed-of horror it
rang again in his ears-that magnified
neigh a scream of intolerable agony

more human

 he staggered to his feet his cap was
gone his saber had flown out of the
scabbard fallen a dozen feet away   
to hell with that thirg he didnt need
it while he still had his revolver maybe
he wasnt badly hurt or even hurt at all
but painter-old painter his best friend
lay there screaming his bowels half torn
out by the exploding shell

  sergeant brumby shook his arms
howling cursesat them all the gun
that had got painter was far away but
that gray line was close and the bronze-
bearded officer in command was laugh-
ing laughing for the first time in
his life si brumby took deliberate aim
at a particular man and fired the
bronze-bearded man swayed in the
saddle his hat flew off with a grin of
vindictive satisfaction si turned back to
his horse good old painter dying in
agony there was one thing his best
friend could still do for him si shut his
eyes thrust the muzjle of his revolver
against painters forehead pulled the
trigger the bang the recoil told him
that painters troubles were over but
he turned clear around away from what
he couldnt bear to look at before he
opened his eyes-and saw a horseman in
gray coming at him swinging a saber

around the bronze-bearded man
 there had risen cries of consterna-
tion  the general the general  an
officer seized his bridle rein led his
horse to the rear another officer-only
a boy red-eyed from smoke and sleep-
lessness-stared in horror at that in-
credible sight and then looked back at
the union sergeant bending over a fallen
horse

  he got jeb stuart the boy groaned
damn him he got jeb stuart

  jeb stuart the greatest man in the boy
officers world-the knightly commander
who always went intc battle gay and
laughing the boy officer raised his re-
volver pulled the trigger    empty
he flung it away hed rather do this
job with a saber anyway he wished he
could do it with his bare hands he
spurred his horse forward

  si brumby looked up at him con-
temptuously saber huh he leveled
his revolver at the gray-coated body
squeezed the trigger  a click he
jerked the trigger in frantic haste an-
other click another and as the swing-
ing saber came down on his head he
realized that he had fired his priceless
last bullet into his horse

the eighth wonder
of the womol

the doctor swung around his eyes
blazing has unybody been fooling
about wih this body

  he tattooed man has died said
i isaac heron quietly i thought
x you would like to see the body be-
fore it is buried

  detective inspector graves swathed
in a raincoat his bowler hat dripping
wet exploded amazement and exasper-
ation at his friend the gypsy they stood
on the edge of a fair-ground where a
gasoline lamp hissed and spluttered in
the rain

  dyou really mean to tell me heron
that youve brought me from a comfort-
able fireside to this god-forsaken part of
london to see a corpse good heavens
dont i see enough bodies in the course
of my work

  but not tattooed bodies said isaac
heron with a queer smile

  the gypsy detective isaac heron

  solves one of his strangest cases

by william
j makin

  but you said this tattooed man had
died

  oh everything is in order said the
gypsy the doctor has signed the death-
certificate and the poor fellow is to be
buried in the morning unless you stop
it

  detective inspector graves frowned

  but why should i if the doctor is
satisfied that the man died from natural
causes-

  isaac heron shrugged his shoulders

  better come inside the tent out of
the rain anyhow he suggested

  and because this well-to-do gypsy had
on a numbq of occasions been of very
real help in solving difficult cases the
scotland yard man followed the lithe
figure of isaac heron into that maze of
drenched light that called itself ironi-
cally a fun fair

  they passed gaudy roundabouts churn-
ing out last years jazz booths with
dart-throwers shooting galleries with
spouting celluloid balls and lemonade
stalls with bellied bowls of yellow liq-
uid impeded their progress eventually
pushing through an apathetic and drift-
ing crowd of damp people they reached
a dark deserted booth where no lights
were flaring

  it was possible however to glimpse
a gaudy painting of a man whose torso
was smothered with fantastic and writh-
ing designs

  graves stopped to read an announce-
ment on a signboard which assaulted the
eyes with the wording

hat he found himself regarding two
trestles which upheld a coffin in which
lay the body of elmer hayes the tat-
tooed man

  even in death that purple-pricked
body was exhibited the huge chest dis-
played a series of fantastic designs-
butterflies snakes airplanes winging

he must have suf-
fered muttered the
scotland yard man
poisoned wheezed
a voice at his elbow

  graves stumbled up the wooden steps
across a little platform and followed the
gypsy into the booth

  a strange scene was revealed a single
low-burning lamp was slung from the
canvas roof a group of figures as fan-
tastic as any painted by goya were
clustered beneath it the fat lady in
a baby frock glycerine-like tears squeez-
ing from her eyes the lion-tamer
uncomfortably tapping his stained rid-
ing-breeches with a whip three dwarfs
standing on chairs to peer over the shoul-
ders of others shirt-sleeved men from
the booths and a solitary italian ice-
cream vendor

  the group fell apart as isaac heron
advanced and in the dim light their faces
seemed filled with genuine sorrow for
a moment graves hesitated then with
an uncomfortable feeling he removed his

among purple clouds hearts with dag-
gers in them and purple blood dripping
a union jack and tie american stars
and stripes a clipper on a rough purple
sea-there was no end to the conglomer-
ation of pictures

but it was to the now rigid face that
graves turned his gaze although the
eyes were closed and the face possessed
a semblance of peace in death there was
something drawn something tortured in
those features that suggested the end
was no happy one

  he must have suffered muttered the
scotland yard man

  poisoned wheezed a voice at his
very elbow

  the detective turned a mustached
man with eyes magnified by spectacles
was standing there
the tattooed man



 what dyou mean by that-poi-
soned  snapped graves

  just what i said poisoned went on
the mustached man poisoned by his
tea i should say he would eat mussels
and drink any sort of liquor that was
given to him tha t was the tea he had
before he died i warned him against

on the back of the body doctor if youve
no objection he said holding a match
to the cigarette

  none at all delighted said the
medical man allow me

  he plunged his hands into the coffin
and with a deft twist of powerful wrists
turned the body over the back of the
corpse was revealed also smothered in
purple-pricked designs

i think ive seen enough grunted
graves there was something about

it told him his stomach couldnt stand
it but of course he paid no attention
nobody ever does to me but i come
in at the death

  he cackled in a grim fashion

 who are yov anyhow asked the
inspector

  a doctor replied the other twisting
his mustache importantly they call
me the shilling doctor but i dont al-
ways get my shilling

  and you say this man was poisoned 
by himself acute toxins resulting
from indigestion attacking the heart or
as we physicians call it gastric enteritis
youll find that on the death-certificate
   have you a match

  his tobacco-slained mouth was slant-
ing a cigarette at the detective

  but it was isaac heron who obliged
  id like my friend to see the designs

a low-burning lamp revealed a
fantastic group clustered about
a coffin in which lay the body
of the tattooed man

this group of freaks and the sardonic
shilling doctor that made him feel sick
and he was anxious to regain the rain-
slashed darkness of the open air

  but i particularly want you to see
this design graves insisted the quiet
voice of isaac heron

  reluctantly the inspector followed the
pointing brown finger and bent his head
nearer for among that phantasmagoria
of dragons and flaming torches and yawn-
ing crocodiles was a tombstone and
marked on the tombstone minutely
pricked but clearly discernible were the
words

sacred to the memory of
elmer hayes
died nov  

                                     ys

  and when did this poor fellow die
asked graves

  yesterday replied the doctor im-
portantly he was not looking at the
body you will find it on the death


the blue book magazine

certificate which is quite in order gas-
tric enteritis november   
thank you doctor said isaac her-
on

  but-but has he seen this blurted
out graves

  seen what asked the physician he
bent down over the corpse umph
thats queer november th the
very day he died i wonder how he
got that tattoo mark

  it seems fairly recent to me said
heron

  the doctor nodded yes it is very
recent he swung round upon the little
group of freaks has anybody been
fooling about with this body

  his eyes were blazing behind the
spectacles

a shirt-sleeved individual pushed

his way forward

  praps i can explain guvnor
  who are you

  the shirt-sleeved individual jerked his
head in the direction of the body

  he was my show i paid him his
wages

  and what do you know about this
tattoo mark demanded graves

  the showman scratched his head
well guvnor all i can say is he had
it done hisself he was alius anxious to
add a new picture to his collection as
it were most big towns we stopped at
he would look round for a tattooer and
ask for a new picture that one youre
looking at now was done about a week
ago leastways thats when elmer
started going to a new tattooer hed
found

  the doctor grunted

  well that explains it he turned to
the scotland yard man and the gypsy
seen enough

  quite enough thank you doctor
said isaac heron

  deftly the body was turned over as
the men moved away the group of show
people the freaks the dwarfs and the
workers closed in again upon the coffin
and resumed their silent staring mourn-
ing

  theres elmers daughter indicated
the shirt-sleeved man poor girl she
misses her father shocking

  isaac heron followed by the detective
moved over to a figure sitting on an up-
turned bucket and crouched in an atti-
tude of grief

  my dear he murmured

  a shock of black hair was raised re-

vealing a face whose slightly yellow
tinge high cheek-bones and oblique eyes
emphasized an asiatic origin

  her mother was a jap whispered the
showman she died when the girl was
born so elmer told me

  is there anything  can do for you
asked heron

  the girl shook her head

  nothing-nothing father is dead-
and thats all

  sobs choked tie rest of her utterance
sadly the gypsy turned away he whis-
pered something to the showman who
nodded it was the shilling doctor who
broke in upon them

  well i suppose theres a queue of
patients waiting for me you wont
need me any more the end of his
glowing cigarette was almost burning
his lips everything is in order youve
got the death-certificate    good night
gentlemen

  and peering through his spectacles he
shuffled away into the night

  five minutes later isaac heron and
detective inspector graves were stand-
ing once more in the rain on the edge of
the fair-ground

  well asked the scotland yard
man

  queer isnt it that elmer hayes
should die on the very day that the tat-
tooed tombstone on his back indicated
observed the gypsy

  might be coincidence said graves
and it might be murder heron re-
joined quietly

  the scotland yard man started i
saw no indications of that

  not even the redness and swelling be-
neath the tattooing of the tombstone
heavens no are you suggesting-
poison   nodded isaac heron cer-
tainly not gastric enteritis that shilling
doctor is overworked and careless and
once hes signed a death-certificate he
believes in it implicitly

  graves stared at his companion
arent you rather jumping to con-
clusions 

  maybe i am admitted the gypsy
but heres a taxi lets take it theres
something else i want to show you to-
night

  graves was too bewildered to protest

t saw the body of elmer hayes
 earlier in the day explained isaac
heron leaning back comfortably in the
taxi and incidentally i spotted that
peculiarly new tattoo mark
the tattooed man



  who told you ol his death asked
graves

  a brother of the black tents smiled
the gypsy news travels fast among
show folk and i confess to a barnum-
like fascination for freaks yes i went
to see the body of that poor fellow out
of sheer curiosity

  and having seen it

  i telephoned for one of the best tat-
tooists in london to come and see it you
probably know the man he has his
shop or studio as he prefers to call it
near waterloo bridge

  i know him ncdded graves

  i showed him that tombstone on the
back of the dead man he examined it
through a magnifying glass to him that
design was as plain as a fingerprint to
your department at scotland yard
what was plain about it

  that it was the work of a japanese
tattoo artist i dont know whether you
are aware graves but the art of tattoo-
ing began in the east and reached its
highest development in japan the
japanese became past-masters of the
art then it was prohibited in the east
and it traveled across the world and
flourished in our east end

  japanese said the startled graves
that girl we sew weeping for her
father was half japanese

  isaac heron nodded

  her mother was pure japanese she
married elmer hayes when as a sailor
he landed in japan and as my tattoo
expert pointed out the majority of the
three hundred and fifty designs on that
body we saw had t een done by japanese
artists

  as also the tombstone 

  yes the tombstone that was pricked
into his body only a few days ago
emphasized the gypsy but the artist
who executed thai design even though
murder was in his heart and stringing at
the end of his needles couldnt resist
putting his signature toiis devilment
signature i saw no signature pro-
tested graves

  just the letters fs beneath the in-
scription on the tombstone said heron
they were enough

  the scotland yard man gave a quick
glance out of the window of the taxi

  i say heron this fellow is heading
for limehouse is that all right
quite all right limehouse is where
the orientals insist upon clustering in
london chinese-and japanese he
added significantly

what a beautiful white skin for tat-
tooing purred the old japanese

  japanese 

  i took the liberty of telephoning the
poplar police-station in your name ex-
plained heron i asked them if they
knew of any japanese claiming to be a
tattooer with the initials fs who had
set up shop in their district i must
say they were exceedingly smart with-
in ten minutes they had the information
for me yogai safu was my man his
address was limehouse causeway and
here we are

heron tapped sharply on the drivers
window the man slurred his cab
against the pavement and stopped the
two men stepped out they were at the
entrance to that dark twisting gully of
a street where solitary men shuffle quiet-
ly against unlighted houses

  limehouse causeway

  followed by the scotland yard man
isaac heron plunged into that cleft in
the darkness they walked for about a
hundred yards then the gypsy stopped
outside a shuttered shop that presented a
blind exterior the gypsy stretched out
a hand found a door-knob turned it and
padded along a narrow corridor then
he opened another door and entered a
	the blue book magazine

room badly lit by a shield of bluish white
gas

  graves shuffled after him and peered
about expectantly it was the second
strange interior he had seen that evening
the dirty yellow of the walls was an
almost perfect camouflage for the wrin-
kled almond face of an old japanese
squatting on a heap of greasy cushions
there was not even a blink of surprise
on that impassive oriental face as it re-
garded the intruders

  yogai safu asked the gypsy

  your honorable servant replied the
japanese bowing and displaying a
smooth bald head what would you
have me do gentlemen

  his english was passable his manner
completely assured isaac heron smiled
easily

  ive a friend here who wants to be
tattooed graves started but heron
went on without a pause a sailorman
tells me that japs are the best at the job
and i saw the card in your window
yesterday can you do the job 

  it is gentlemen somewhat late in
the evening

  but my friend is willing to pay
added heron

the scotland yard man sniffed this
opening conversation was not to his lik-
ing he preferred more direct methods
he opened his mouth and spoke roughly
what i want to know- he began
but heron quickly interposed

  my friend as you will gather is a
little nervous but then they all are
eh  graves strip off your coat and bare
your arm to the gentleman

  mechanically but more worried than
ever the scotland yard man obeyed
despite the absurdity of the situation
his trained eyes were observing every de-
tail every object in that strange room

along low table was covered with
little colored bowls and bottles-
inks for the tattooer a bunch of gleam-
ing needles lay in a tray and behind the
table against the wall was pasted a med-
ley of designs mermaids rising on their
tails cherry trees dripping blossoms a
naked diver fighting a shark under water
a dragon breathing fire-these and scores
of other sensational and murderous de-
signs were ranged there

  what a beautiful white skin for
tattooing

  the old japanese was purring as he
took the bared left arm of graves in his
own yellow fingers the scotland yard

man shuddered at the touch at the same
time he gave an appealing glance at
isaac heron which suggested that the
farce had gone far enough

  and will the gentleman decide upon
the design asked the japanese

  heron replied witn that subtle smile

  my friend is often in dangerous
situations he might easily be killed
and his body be unrecognized now i
suggest that as a form of identification
you tattoo a tombstone on his arm

  a tombstone 

  the oblique eyes of the japanese
seemed to become mere slits in a yellow
mask as he repeated the words

  why not inquired the gypsy its
not an unusual design is it

  no

  then go ahead

  the yellow hand stretched out for a
needle the point was tried against a
thumb he lit a spir it lamp and dabbed
the needle in the flame then he dipped
it into a little bowl of purple ink

  and what name would the honorable
gentleman like to have tattooed on the
tombstone asked the japanese the
needle poised in the air

  detective inspector graves of scot-
land yard replied isaac heron

graves felt the yellow clutch on his
arm tighten but on the face of the
tattooer there was no expression

  very well he murmured and dipped
the needle into another bowl

  the slitlike eyes were regarding the
sinewy white arm that he held in his
grasp beads of perspiration broke out
on the brow of the detective his own
gaze was fixed upon that gleaming needle
that was about to plunge into his arm

  but even as the needle came toward
the white skin the hand of isaac heron
was quicker his fingers clutched the
hand of the old japanese in a vise-like

grip-

  grab the other hand graves came
his warning voice

  the scotland yard man was only too
eager to obey in a few seconds the
japanese was lying on the cushions his
yellow wrists circled with the steel hand-
cuffs which graves always thoughtfully
carried about with him

  poison as i suspected said heron
sniffing at one of the little bowls once
he heard you were from scotland yard
he realized he was suspected he in-
tended you to go the s ame way as elmer
hayes isnt that so yogai safu
the tattooed man



  for once the yellow mask was twisted
with rage

  elmer hayes was a white dog he
deserved to die twenty years ago i
swore at the shrine of my ancestors to
kill him 

  twenty years ago

  isaac heron lifted an eyebrow in-
quiringly

in native fashion the japanese hissed
through clenched teeth

  twenty years ago that elmer hayes
pose as honorable gentleman and come
to my studio in yokohama for be tat-
tooed he wanted many many designs
upon body i not know it was in-
tention to show himself to crowds and
make money by displaying body ugh
a vulgar practice but many things i
did not know at that time

  what else didrt you know asked
the gypsy

  elmer hayes had infatuated my
daughter my only daughter she was
as sweet as cherry blossom in spring
i loved her as the last descendant of most
honorable ancestors that white dog
from overseas snuggled her away in
steamer

 the old mans voice was firm not a
tear trickled down that wrinkled face
and then encouraged heron

  i make for hara-kiri said the old
man but even as i prepare before
shrine of ancestors voice told me it was
duty to get vengeance first honor had
been violated until stain had been
washed out with blood my work on this
miserable earth not ended i packed up
my needles my inks and my kakemono
and sailed for america

  a stranger in strange countries it
was not easy for me to follow their path
i find myself always too late across
america into europe through far lands
i follow-for twenty years i must
stop often to earn money with tattoo
i open studio here inlondon then
one morning the man himself walked
into studio

  the gods of my ancestors had an-
swered my prayers and given enemy into
my hands he not recognize me i
used the same initials but fake name
he saw only an old nipponese who prac-
tice ancient art of tattooing he asked
me to prick design on back one of few
empty places left i think first kill him
quick then i remember he taken my

daughter to live his life of shame she
had died in poverty he must suffer for
that so slowly with cunning i pricked
poison into his body while making tomb-
stone on his back i knew just when
that poison would take effect so i
pricked date on tombstone

  yes we saw it said graves roughly
on his dead body eh  chuckled the
old man

  there was silence for a moment then
isaac heron spoke

  there is one thing you do not know
old man he said

  and what is that honorable sir
elmer hayes has a daughter you
are her grandfather

  once again came that hiss of emotion
through clenched teeth the old japa-
nese seemed to age before their eyes

  that i did not know he fajtered
is-is she beautiful

  like her mother

  the old man sighed

  it is not right that her grandfather
should be branded as a murderer

the remark seemed to rouse detec-
tive inspector graves he reached
out for his coat and struggled into it

  well be making our way to the
station he said i must phone to stop
the burial of elmer hayes for tomorrow
he took hold of the old japanese and
raised him from the couch of cushions
in that moment the man seemed to age
incredibly he swayed and almost crum-
pled to the floor with a jerk graves
brought him to his feet

  i apologize honorable sir smiled
the japanese weakly you see i am
dying

dying graves stared disconcerted
yes mumbled the old man my
work now is finished i have avenged
it is better for the girl-she who is my
granddaughter-that i do not live

  he seemed to lapse into a coma with
the help of isaac heron the detective
carried the japanese to the door under
the light of the street lamp the gypsy
gave the old man a searching glance

  yes he nodded to graves i think
he is dying-and because he has deter-
mined in his mind to die i doubt
whether youll ever get him to trial the
ways of the oriental are strange graves
and he went off in search of a taxi
leaving graves supporting a very old
and unconscious man

another of isaac herons strange cases murder on the
merrjr-go-round will be described in an early issue

on a wild night in january my cause of that
uncle thurland spillane came
home to my fathers farm which
is on the road from glengariff to ken-
mare seven years he had been away he
and his brother my uncle flane un-
tamed hawks of trouble were they both
ranging the wide world

 and where might you have come
from now asked my father

  from london answered thurland

i came a roundabout way out of russia

by china and other places i have hur-
ried here because another person-a per-
son that i love more than my two eyes
and my two hands-is making for your
farm across the world she is heading
for this little spot in kerry

  and he went bn to tell us of this
lovely lady daughter of a czar and a
woman of perm in irkutsk the assas-
sins of czar nicholas had sought to kill
her too and thurland had fought for
her and killed the assassins-and there
was a price on his head in russia be-

                    they had fallen in
 love but had to part to evade pursuit
 and he had given her the name of our
 farm in kerry as the only fixed address
 by which he might be reached now he
 had learned she was coming-and he
 was here to meet her   

   she came at last a lady even lovelier
 than thurland described her and it was
 a joy to see the two homeless wanderers
 together at our peaceful farm in kerry
 but pursuit caught up with them-in the
 person of a giant russian thurland
 fought him choked him-left him for
 dead and fled the country again with the
 lady-anastasia her name was

  long months passed then came a
letter from thurland-a letter from fez
where he and flane and the lady were
making ready for a hazardous journey
into the far sahara in quest of a tre-
mendous buried treasure flane knew of

   i was fifteen and strong for my age
 and africa came up and snuffed around
 my bed that night i made a bundle

treasure

of my clothes clinbed out of the window
and took the road to kenmare

  in cork i made friends with a boy of
my own age and through his help won a
job as cabin-boy on a ship sailing to
morocco at algiers my friend felix
and i were given shore-leave and we got
into trouble aplenty in a native cafe
indeed we might have lost our lives had
we not been rescued by-my uncle
thurland  none other passing by he
had heard our irish voices

  felix rejoined he ship but i stayed
with my uncles thurland and flane-
and with anastasia who was with them
they had a map which located this grand
caravan treasure far in the southern
sahara and were making ready to set
out with them i went-to fez and
marrakech and thence out into the desert
beyond the last french outpost with
us also went an arab wrestler ahmed
mansour whom my uncle flane had beat
in a great bout and had made friends
with and also in our party were two

other natives the hairy man blore and
a strange dwarf who knew something of
the caravan treasure   

  one night as we were camped near a
mud-walled village i was roused by a
terrible scream and the flashlight in the
hands of flane showed the hairy man
running back to us in the spear of light
i saw the blade still red in his hands

  douse the light  he cried help
me with the dwarf quick he has
been knocked senseless 

  ahmed mansour and flane hoisted the
unconscious haila onto the saddle be-
fore blore the hairy one holding him
there thurland put anastasia on her
camel the rest of us scrambled quickly
on our mounts and hurriedly we went
forward into the darkness africa had
started in pursuit of us-africa the ter-
rible the story continues in detail

with the faint light of the rising
moon we halted and checked up we
were a little disorganized for the happen-




the blue book magazine

 inghad rushed us off our feet so to speak
 and till the moon permitted us to count
 noses we were not sure of our number

  what was it jimmy whispered
anastasia

   i dont know i answered lying lest
 i cause her pain i think some one
 was trying to steal a camel

  but that scream she breathed i
-i can hear it now

  thurland was busy pouring a drink
of brandy down the throat of the dwarf
who was now returning to consciousness
flane had ridden back a few yards and
was listening in case we were pursued

  we went on-blindly so i thought
thurland and flane had arguments with
the hairy man but he persisted that he
was going in the right direction when
morning came he pointed to a bare
peak to the westward as prof that he
was not out in his reckoning

  we were in the center of a sandy
plain the peak to the west the only high
ground in sight there were no trees
a few stunted bushes fought with the
sand dunes that forever tried to smoth-
er them

   twenty miles farther on is the vil-
lage of the dwarf said blore he
grinned and added there his faithful
wife waits for him though she hasnt
seen him for more than a year

  whether it was the blow that the
dwarf had received or the nearness to his
own village that affected him i do not
know but that morning he couldnt stop
singing sitting in the meager shadow
thrown by a blanket stretched between
two thorn-bushes he sang songs of love
in a low buzzing note that bit at the ear
like the humming of a blow-fly

   the song annoyed flane for it seemed
to accentuate the heat flane asked him

 to move out of earshot so that the rest
 of us could sleep

  blore explained the song it told of
the arrival of the dwarf at his village
and how in the soft darkness before the
dawn he would sneak quietly into the
mud hut and creep into the arms of his
beloved and the song told of her
charms she had eyes according to the
verse into which a lover fell to be
drowned in their sweetness she had
limbs more beautiful than the limbs of
a gazelle and her lips hit the heart of
a watcher like the blow from a poniard

  tell him to walk out on the sands
and do his singing the-re said flane

  the dwarf unable to keep quiet
moved out on the sandy plain and con-
tinued his song his words came thin
and faint to us as we tried to sleep   
i wondered about the dwarf he had
informed my uncle thurland that he
would not desert us our caravan would
pass about midnight within three miles
of his village he would slip away on
foot pay a quick visit to his wife and
overtake us when we camped at daylight
he would on no account mention that
we were in the neighborhood little did
we know then of the trouble that call
would bring upon us-the load of black
trouble that nearly overwhelmed us

when night fell we moved on the
dwarf still humming his song of
love the moon was a white-faced hag
that watched us knowing perhaps that
we were running into trouble the stunted
camel-thorn bushes were witches and
around them danced the jinn that the
winds of the wastes built out of handfuls
of sand it was a bad night-a night
that was out for mischief as they say
in kerry waiting for some opening that
would give it a chance to work off its
deviltry

  a little before midnight we heard the
faint throbbing of a tcm-tom it came
from the village of the dwarf and the
sound made him a little fey he slipped
from the camel and ran off across the
sands and we watched him till he dis-
appeared behind a saney ridge

  do you think well ever see him
again asked flane

  i dont know laughed thurland
perhaps the lady may have found
some one to amuse her during his ab-
sence if so he might catch up to us

  we made camp at daylight close to
a well we filled the goat-skin bags and
stretched ourselves in the shade there
caravan treasure



 were tracks of camels goats and donkeys
 around the well-head but there was no
 one in sight at midday we lunched on
 dried gazelle meat cooked on the embers
 with kous-kous and biscuits we won-
 dered a little about the dwarf would

	the lady with the eyes in which lovers
 were drowned be delighted to see the
 little fellow when he crept into her hut

 it was in the hottest part of the after-
 noon that my uncle thurland saw a
 running figure out on the sands at first
 we thought it a gazelle but as it came
 nearer we saw that it was a man

   its haila cried thurland it is
 and hes running as if old nick himself
 was at his heels 

   it was the dwari for sure a crazed
 dwarf with the eyes of him popping out
 of his head stumbling with weakness
 he covered the last hundred yards and
 dropped at the fee of thurland with
 his arms around the legs of my uncle
 he begged protection and a feeling of
 trouble in store was upon each one of us
 as he started to splatter out his story

   this was hailas tale as he told it to
 us there by the well of el-djanet an
 old tale but a thrilling one to us be-
 cause of the trouble that reached out
 with steely fingers and dragged us into
 the mess

   quick in the telling was haila for
 death was at his heels it seemed that
 the moment he reached the village he
 had dived into the narrow burrow in
 which stood the mud hut that sheltered
 his wife thinking to surprise the lady
 he had thrust his arm through a round
 hole in the door and pulled a secret string
 that held a bar of iron in place the bar
 fell the door opened  and haila crying
 the name of his wife rushed toward the
 corner where the hied of sheepskins was
 spread in the days before he wandered
 to far-off marrakech

   he was halfway to the bed when he
 came into violent collisfn with an un-
 known who was seeking the door with
 the same fine burst of speed that was
 bringing haila to the bedside of his
 wife the two met with the force of
 two rams fighting for the supremacy of
 a sheep paddock they crashed to the
 floor and haila knew by the touch of
 steely fingers that were groping for his
 throat that it was no wifely caress he
 was receiving he knew that

   over and over they rolled the dwarf
 getting the worst of it then the tide
 turned the unknown lover had not

 thought fit to bring his knife to the ren-
 dezvous while haila had his at a mo-
 ment when they broke apart the dwarf
 got a chance to pull it from his belt and
 he made a blind jab in the darkness
 he buried the weapon between two ribs
 of the other and the fellows yells and
 his wifes screams woke the quarter
 the dwarf fled toward our camp

  save me screamed haila holding
tight to the ankles of my uncle he -is
the nephew of the caid he has three
hundred uncles and cousins they
come they come they will torture
me and cut me into little pieces

  the hairy man clucked fiercely and
pointed out across the wastes a black 
mass from which came an infamous
clamor was moving across the sand-
moving with an accompaniment of 
shouts and screams that were deafening 
as they came nearer the three hundred 
uncles and cousins were in pursuit of
haila and all thoughts of the woman
with golden feet flew from our minds
as we stared at them

  my uncle thurland acted quickly

he stooped dragged the fear-stricken
dwarf into the tent where anastasia was
resting and thrust him under a camel-
hair blanket stay there till i tell you
to come out he said if you move-
itll be death

  the mob were upon us then at theif
head was the cafd a tall dark man of
about thirty years of age and with no
more politeness than an angry bull he
wanted haila he screamed his demand
and the hundreds behind him echoed it

j

now thurland spillane was a fine and
fearless protector the caid made
his request in french and thurland an-
swered him in the same tongue--
answered him with cold and careful lies
haila said thurland and there wasnt
a quiver in his voice had rushed by the
tents screaming out that he was pur-
sued and had fled into the big sand
dunes to the eastward of us

   it was a lie with trimmings a fine lie
 that burrowed into the ears of the caid
 and his followers and the manner of
 thurland as he stood and delivered it
 must have made the sweet angels of
 mercy in heaven weep as they listened

  the caid wished to look within the
tent and he attempted to push thur-
land aside but there was murder in the
eye of my uncle he caught the vil-
lage chieftain by his flowing burnous
and hurled him backward amongst his
the blue book magazine
caravan treasure



the caid stared at
anastasia then he
said to thurland
you must come to
the village-with all
your party

followers the hairy man clucked ex-
citedly and flane swore softly

 thurland spoke in the high manner
that he had didnt he say that haila
had rushed off into the sand dunes did
the caid wish to call him a liar the
truth had been told and no one would
be permitted to enter the tent to make
a search

  there was a moment of tension when
everyone seemed to hold their breath
then the caid laughed sdttly-laughed
softly as if he thought there was a lot
of time in the world to settle with my
uncle thurland hi gave an order to
the crowd that muttered angrily behind
him and with him at their head they
streamed out across the wastes their
splay feet scattering the sand as they
deployed in line formation to search the
dunes for haila

  thurland stepped into the tent pulled
the blanket from haila and spoke
youve got one chance crawl through
the back of the tent and run

  haila took the advice creeping on
all fours he moved through a stony
stretch at the back of the tent and dis-
appeared

  thurland came to the front of the tent
where the rest of us stood waiting-
flane the wrestler the hairy man and
i anastasia peered out through the
flap of the tent

  and now  said flane to his brother

  were in for trouble i think said
thurland quietly

  we might have given him up said
blore it would have saved us

  thurland turned and looked at the
hairy man looked at him with his fierce
eyes and blore wilted under the look
no one ever asked a spillane for sanc-
tuary and was refused he said softly
an old dog-fox ran into the cabin of
my grandmother when i was a little
boy and she walloped the huntsman
the hounds and the hunters who tried to
get it away from her

  theyll take us prisoners muttered
ahmed mansour

  its bad luck said thurland but
there was no other way out well wait
he spoke softly to anastasia whose eyes
showed the great fear that possessed her

the caid with the three hundred
searchers at his heels returned to our
tent the caid had a grin upon his
face a grin that told plainly he wasnt
pleased with us he stepped close to


the blue book magazine

thurland and fired questions at him
who were we what were we doing
there where were we going and why

  thurland answered in the tricky man-
ner that he had when dealing with in-
quisitive persons he embroidered the
story that he had told the inspector at
marrakech but this time in an en-
deavor to please the caid he made the
lost englishman an enemy of france

  the caid considered the answers for
a moment then as he stood thoughtful
anastasia appeared at the open flap of
the tent it was the first time the caid
had seen her and although her face was
veiled so that only her eyes and brow
showed he seemed impressed with the
strange wild beauty of her

  the caid stared at her in astonish-
ment then he turned on thurland you
must come back to the village he said
speaking in french you must come
at once with all your party

  thurlands fingers were at the holster
on his hip and his eyes blazed as he
heard the command but there were
three hundred men with swords and guns
around us and to start a fight would
have been madness we would have
been massacred inside five minutes

  if we refuse asked thurland

  the caid grinned this is my coun-
try he said if you refuse to come
to the village youll go no further

chapter xii

thurland fights a duel

we were prisoners-prisoners of a
fierce wild crowd who were whipped
into a fury because one of their number
had been killed by the dwarf prisoners
of a caid whose eyes turned often to
survey anastasia in the journey from
our camp to the village

  the hairy man clucked in a manner
that showed his disgust at the situation
ahmed mansour frowned at the mob
that surrounded us flane and thurland
talked in undertones and the little devils
of terror sat in my own heart as we
entered the gate of the walled village

  the evening had closed in but there
were torches to light our passage along
the narrow lanes which were completely
covered with palm fronds so that they
were dark and cool even during the
hottest hours of the day the people
swarmed around us pushing and jostling
each other to get a glimpse of us shriek-
ing questions and answers so that the

noise was deafening thurland and flane
walked on either side of anastasia to
save her from the fierce wretches who
fought with each other to get close to
her disloyal i was at that moment to
my uncle i thought of the name that
they called him in glengariff and ken-
mare mad thurland spillane he was
indeed and fine proof we who marched
with him had of his madness

at the endof a souk that reeked of
 the odors of cinnamon clove mint
and orange-flowers we came to the house
of the caid and one after the other
we were pushed through an immense
door studded with brass nails we found
ourselves in a passage lighted here and
there with a torch the mob fought to
follow us but they were thrust back by
two wild devils whc used the decorated
butts of their long rifles to bang the
faces of the persistent ones

  along the passage we went the caid
and some twenty iren around us the
floor was of mud beaten hard by bare
feet through the years the walls were
of an orange tint and on them hung
saddles and bridles for horses and camels
so that the smell of badly tanned leather
nearly choked us up a ramp to a floor
above moving swiftly now then another
nail-studded door was thrust open and
without ceremony we were pushed into
a big room that was without windows
the air entering by openings just below
the ceiling openings that were fifteen
feet from the floor a man stuck a torch
in an iron ring stepped out and shouted
orders

  half-naked men arrived with a bale
of mats another of carpets they tossed
them onto the floor three others entered
and demanded in the name of the caid
all weapons that we carried thurland
considered the request for a moment
then handed over his revolver the
others followed his example the men
backed out and slammed the door we
heard the big bolt shoot home with a
loud clang

  thurland had the two hands of anas-
tasia in his own he was whispering
softly to her trying to chase the fear
from her face the rest of us stood to-
gether looking at the door the sudden-
ness of the business brought a sort of
mental paralysis upon us three hours
before we had been free people on a
great adventure now we were prisoners
in the house of this chief of a murder-
ous crew of ruffians
caravan treasure



   flane spoke addressing his brother
 what will come out of this he asked
 if its to hold us for ransom well have
 a long wait if we were french the
 government might buy us out of the
 hole but in the whole history of ireland
 there was never a cent paid to free an
 irishman

   ahmed mansour nade a few remarks
 in arabic that were certainly not prayers

   we should have given them the
  dwarf began the hairy man if they
 dont find him well-

   my uncle thurland interrupted him
 with a quick motion of his hand thats
 enough he snapped we couldnt give
 up the dwarf what will happen to us
 i dont know but were not dead yet
 scared jimmy

 yes i answered im awful scared
 this will teach you a lesson said
 thurland when you get back to the
 green tree farm stay there and grow
 potatoes

   i will i said that is if i ever
 do get back

   youll get home said thurland
 things dont look bright this evening
 but they might change at any moment
 i have a hunch that they will

   a portion of our own provisions was
 brought to us and we sat on the mats
 and ate with no great appetite the big
 bare room was full of dancing shadows
 thrown by the flickering torch it burned
 down to the iron ring then the stub of
 it dropped to the floo- to be stamped out
 by ahmed mansour we were in a soft
 gloom that lightened as the moon rose
 the light coming in through the openings
 close to the roof

   we lay upon the mats and carpets
 waiting for the morning we couldnt
 sleep africa seemed a terrible place to
 me that night   

   it was hardly daylight when the door
 swung open and the caid stepped into
 the room thurland was standing up
 the rest of us were sitting on the mats
 the caid arrogant and smiling ad-
 dressed my uncle what he said he
 speaking french i did not know at the
 moment but i learned later-learned by
 scraps that came to me from the talk be-
 tween flane and thur and and anastasia
 and the clucking of tbe hairy man

   the face of thurla nd as he listened to
 the caid told me that whatever the
 proposition was it wasnt pleasing not
 pleasing at all for the red of temper
 appeared under the tan on my uncles
 face and his eyes blazed just for an

instant i thought he would spring at the
caid but he controlled the sinewy hands
that itched to get at the fellows throat

  this in a few words was the proposal
of the caid we were free to go for-
ward on one condition the caid had
taken a fancy to anastasia and we could
clear out as fast as we liked if anastasia
would stay behind

  for a minute thurland stood looking
at the man who made the proposition
then he turned and walked toward
anastasia he put his arm- around her
waist and stood with his back turned to
the caid a frightful silence came into
the room a silence that choked the cluck-
ing of the hairy man a dozen faces
watched from the doorway fierce cruel
faces that found pleasure in our distress

  the caid commenced to speak but
thurland wheeled on him and stopped
him with a word

  the caid spoke to the men at the
door they sprang back and opened an-
other door immediately opposite with
a wave of his hand the caid invited
thurland and the rest of us to step for-
ward and examine the place

  in my dreams for all time i will see
that room into which we stepped with
faltering feet night after night it has
swung into my sleep and my eyes have
run along the cursed implements that
hung upon its walls for in that room
were the most dreadful things for tor-
turing people that the mind of man could
conceive

  they hung there one after the other
each was designed to produce its par-
ticular brand of agony the tall snaky
caid had a torquemada-like passion for


the blue book magazine

inflicting pain and he had collected
every article that could be used for that
purpose-every cruel device designed by
maniacs to torture flesh

 cunningly made and devised were
those articles the sight of which pro-
duced a strange upsetting of the stomach

  a breath of hell came from them
for they had been used and lately too
and it was that visible evidence of use
that stirred thurland spillane stirred
the hot irish blood of him so that he
turned and spat his wrath in the face of
the devil who had us in his power

the exact words thurland used i can-
not tell here he using french to ad-
dress the caid but i heard the rough
translations later words with a thorn
in them words that bit and pricked at
the dark hide of the fellow for my
uncle had a lash to his tongue so that
men grew mad under his insults this
is what i heard he said

  is it this you spend your life at he
asked the caid pinching and burning
poor wretches that are in your power a
fine dirty devil you are with no one bold
enough to wipe the grin off your face
with his fist listen to me you small
satan of the wastes ill fight you
in any way you like fists swords or
pistols and if you beat me the lady
stays here with you if i beat you we
go free with our camels and provisions
be a man for once in your life and meet
a man on equal terms and as my
uncle said that he hit the caid with the
back of his hand in the mouth hit him
that hard that it brought blood

  the men who were around the caid
sprang at thurland and there wras a fine
chance that he would be trussed up and
tortured there and then but their chief
stopped them the lash in my uncles
tongue had bit deep into the pride of the
fellow and he was stirred in a way that
was unusual to him the courage of
thurland had startled him no man ever
having dared to slap him in the mouth
and he was wondering how he could wipe
out the insult wipe it out in such a way
as to gain the respect of the men around
him who had seen the blow struck and
who were astonished at the cool nerve
and impudence of thurland spillane

  cunning was thurland he had chosen
the only way by which we could obtain
our liberty the only way in which
anastasia could be saved from the caid

  you shall fight me  shouted the
caid and it shall be as you wish if

you beat me you and your companions
shall be free but there is small chance
i shall spit you and give your body to
the dogs of the village we will fight
with swords does that suit you

  swords or fists or guns cried thur-
land  and there was a grin on his face as
he spoke for to thurland spillane a
fight was what meat and drink are to
most men and the fact that he had
baited the fellow into the proposal he
pul forward tlelighted him immensely

  on a cleared space in the center of the
village there was a platform on which
wrestling matches were held and it was
there that the fight was to take place
there in the blazing sunshine with every
man woman and child in the place to
watch it and we were led out in single
file to see thurland die for that is what
the guards said to us as they pushed us
through the crowd ahmed mansour
translated to us what they said

  it seemed that the caid had been for
years a pupil of a french marquis who
lived at taroudant and who was the
finest swordsman that france had seen
for years he had been run out of paris
for killing three men who were fools
enough to challenge him he having been
paid by cowards tc bait them with in-
sults and they not knowing of his skill
agreeing to a meeting

  the marquis had come to morocco
and at taroudant he had opened a school
for anyone who wished to learn swords-
manship and the greatest pupil that he
had ever had so said the guards that led
us to the square was the caid who was
meeting thurland for the caid had
often held the marquis to a draw in a
hot bout and when he liked to exert
himself a little he could beat him

  cheerful news for us whose safety de-
pended on thurlands blade i walked
beside anastasia and her hands were
cold with dread as i touched them

we were pushed up close to the plat-
form there tc await the arrival of
the caid and in that interval thurland
whispered to anasiasia comforting her
and telling her not to be afraid my
uncle flane was nervous but thurland
was his laughing devil-may-care self

  the caid arrived stripped except for
a pair of shorts he climbed onto the
platform and a man handed up two
beautiful swords flane said in a whis-
per that they were- like french cavalry
swords but he thought they were longer
in the blade and heavier
caravan treasure



  said flane i wish they were lighter
if those blades weigh an ounce they
weigh three pounds it will be hard for
thurland if the fight is long

  it mightnt be i stammered uncle
thurland might whp him quickly
thurland kissed anastasia then he
put one hand on the edge of the plat-
form and although it was as high as his
chin he leaped so that he landed with
his two feet upon it and stood erect a
great leap those eyes of his so like
guards on a castle wall were blazing
and his face was pale under the tan but
he was quite cool and the crowd milled
around muttering and grunting they
sensing that murder was in the air

   you shall fight nel
   shouted the caid i i you
   beat me you and your
   companions shall be free
   but there is small chi nee
   i shall give your body to
   the dogs of the villuge

   thurland stripped off his leather coat
and his vest then with an angry jerk he
pulled his shirt over his head and
when the crowd saw his chest and arms
they grunted in chorus white and
clean-skinned was he and the muscles on
his body were like ropes of fine steel
that rippled beneath his skin as he
moved rippled like startled snakes be-
neath a tissue of satin

  a strange picture he made beside the
dark caid more snaky was the caid
as strong as thurland and perhaps
stronger but his strength hidden on ac-
count of the color of his skin but his
arms were something to look at-long
and powerful the arms of a swordsman

  thurland and the moor stood back
and regarded each other then without a
word from anyone they threw themselves
on guard and the fight was on and the
crowd that had been whispering and
pushing became as s lent as mice the
only sound was the slithering noise made
by the bare feet of the two of them as
they circled but this i knew the caid
saw in the swift movements of thurland
that it wasnt the first time that my
uncle had handled a sword there came
into the black eyes of the man a look of
new cunning and watchfulness

  thurland and thiss information also
came from flane was of a different

school of fencing standing on guard like
the italians his legs farther apart his
left shoulder nearly hidden so that he
exposed but a small mark on the blade of
the other

  the caid however fought in the man-
ner of the french

  never was such a fight seen in that
heat-stricken country never a big
man was the caid standing fully six
feet and although he had weight he
moved with the lightness of a squirrel on
a branch and his hand so big and
strong handled the sword in a way that
was surprising at one instant he would
hold it so loosely that you would think
that it would drop from his fingers but
the next instant he would grip it so tight
that youd think he would leave his
fingermarks on the steel for it is by
this change of grip which men who know
call fingering that a man becomes
great as a fencer

  the caid flung himself at thurland
and from his lips came an arab war-cry
that was fashioned to frighten the man
he was fighting but it had no effect on
thurland he parried the attack in a
way that seemed to puzzle the other

 the cavl was yelling now

  straight and beauiful he stood up to
the fierce attack of the moor giving
ground when he had o but fighting back
when for the slightest second the attack
weakened the hits and the thrusts i
cannot describe for i knew nothing of
the game at the tims being young and
unused to sword battles but this i do
know and i learned i t from the strained
faces of those around me that no man
in the crowd ever saw such a fight

  the flashing of their blades in the sun-
shine blinded us as we watched and al-
ways and always there was the wicked
snaky body of the caid boring in and
always and always the white muscular
body of thurland ready for him puzzling
him with the beautiful wrist-work that
foiled him each time he lunged

  anastasia couldnt look at it she
turned away her face then as the fight
went on she seemed  have a weakness
on her for she put her head down on my
shoulder and sobbed softly taking no
notice of my whispered words when i
told her thurland was holding his own

  tell her gasped flane leaning over
tell her thurland is the better man

he will tire him and sweep him off the
platform when the time comes its
thurl that will show him

  the voice of flane was strange his
words glued together with excitement

  i told anastasia what flane had said
but she didnt seem to hear her sobs
were louder and i was afraid that in the
little intervals of silence when the two
men drew back a bit from each other
thurland would hear her and be upset
not once did his eyes turn in her direc-
tion from the moment he sprang upon
the platform there being little chance
for him to look at anything except the
weaving figure that danced and skipped
before him

  the caid was losing his temper now
the memories of his bouts with the fine
french marquis were rising up in his
mind and asking why he wasnt prodding
holes in the irishman who stood in front




the blue book magazine

of him for it is as my uncle thurland
once said the pride brought by a first
win that often makes us lose the second
fight if i thought the caid and you
could nearly feel what he was thinking
if i held -a master duelist to a draw
and now and then beat him by a margin
why cant i prick the skin of this fel-
low and thinking that he shook him-
self together and whirled his blade so
that the eye couldnt follow it

but thurland was there cool and
watchful suddenly by a cunning
twist he turned the blade of the moor
his sword ran forward like a hissing
snake and pricked the dark skin of the
fellow above the midriff a fleck of
blood showed immediately and a massed
cry of wonder came from the crowd

  i thought the caid would stop then
but that prick from the sword-point only
made him angry that was something
that he hadnt expected and the temper
that was on him before was nothing to
what gripped him then he drove thur-
land across the platform with a rain of
blows it seemed as if the moor were
flinging science to the wind and depend-
ing on a wild rally to finish the business
for sword-fighting is like fist-fighting
and a man forgets all that he knows of
technique when temper masters him

  the caid was yelling now-yelling
like a madman as he cut and slashed
thurland parrying for all that he was
worth the fury of the assault brought
cries from the crowd

  its all right gasped flane tell
her tell her he cant keep that up
thurl will get him  he will he will

  i cried the words of flane into the
ears of anastasia trying to make her
believe what i didnt believe myself
for i watching the devilish manner in
which the caid followed my uncle
couldnt see how thurland could win

  and then the end came with a sud-
denness that choked the yelps of the
crowd-choked them as if the very hap-
pening had a thousand invisible fingers
that snapped a bit of catgut around each
yelling throat and pulled it tight thats
how it seemed to me

  the caid had lunged with all his
force but the white body he aimed at
was not there not there at all and
as he tried to recover seeing the danger
he was in thurland sprang forward and
drove his point through the left shoulder
of the attacker the sword fell from the
caids fingers and he reeled backward

  agh it was what he was waiting
for screamed flarie and i patted the
shoulder of anastasia and tried with
tears running out of my eyes to tell her
that thurland had won

  flane and the hairy man lifted thur-
land from the platform while a hundred
men were around the caid shouting and
cursing although the caid had made
the bargain-and they had thought it a
good bargain-it was only because they
were so sure of his ability to beat
thurland that they looked forward with
joy to the fight now with the chief on
the ground they thought different

  anastasia flung her arms about the
bare body of thurland and kissed him
and kissed him again and not a word
did he say not a word of brag or
bluster but he stood like a child while
flane put his shirt over his head and
drew him back into the shade of some
huts where he wouldnt be in full view
of the crowd for there was a sort of
ugliness upon the crowd now

  im in doubt if this will finish it
growled flane

  why asked thurland

  hell get mad w ith us said flane

  thurland was quiet for a moment
then he spoke he will keep his word
he said slowly he is too good a fight-
er to quit ill go over and speak to
him

  and although the men around the caid
looked black with temper as thurland
approached my uncle pushed his way
to the side of the caid who was now ly-
ing on a heap of cushions that had been
brought for him and in french thur-
land spoke to hirri telling him that he
was sorry that he was hurt and how
good a fighter he was

  and the caid sniled and shook thur-
lands hand-shook it and called him a
good swordsman and although he was
faint from loss of blood he told his men
to give us all that we wanted camels and
dates and water hen turning to thur-
land he asked if he might say good-by
to anastasia

thurland came back took the
hand of anasiasia and led her for-
ward to the caid she was sobbing her
big eyes blurred with tears

  the caid made a little speech telling
her of his regret that he didnt win her
for he like most native people didnt
consider anastasias point of view at all
-he in his pride thinking she would be
perfectly contented to stay with him if
caravan treasure



he had won the fight it made thurland
grin for he knew what would have hap-
pened if the caid had killed thurland
and held anastasia by force

chapter xiii

we see the siave runners

strange was cur departure from
that village with its tinted walls
stern and silent were the people who
stood and watched us their creed of
life was to pillage and kill the persons
weaker than themselves and that fine
belief had been upset by thurlands bat-
tle with the caid

  their eyes showed the bewilderment
that was upon them and they whispered
with each other in an effort to find
reasons camels that they desired great-
ly were going away from them camels
and provisions and arms and there were
a few of them who like the caid were
attracted by the springing slimness of
anastasia so different from their own
ladies who were fed on milk and meal to
bring them to a marriageable fatness

  southward into the glare of the morn-
ing we rode-silent because words when
they formed together in our minds
seemed stupid lacking altogether in the
power to express our thoughts

  we passed the place where we had
been taken prisoner and thoughts of
the singing dwarf came into our minds
the face of thurland softened as he re-
called the poor devils description of his
wifes beauty and the manner in which
he had been received he looked at
anastasia and grinned

  wonder where he is he laughed
and his question broke the queer silence
that had rested on us

  the hairy man gave his opinion that
haila would steer straight southward
thinking that we would catch up to him
if we kept to the trail that we intended
to follow the hairy man was confident
that the dwarf could keep alive in the
wastes he was a desert rat capable of
finding sufficient nourishment where an
ordinary man would starve

  the hairy man had a thousand stories
to tell of men who had escaped death by
a narrow margin in the wastes-stories
that he told in a sing-song voice he
had been lost on five different occasions
and had suffered terribly once himself
and another had opened the veins in the
neck of the camel and had drunk the
blood of the living beist and on another

occasion when a camel had given up the
ghost they had taken the store of water
from the dead animals stomach a
cheerful devil was the hairy man full of
frightening stories

  possibly it was the fear that the caid
would change his mind that kept us mov-
ing on that eventful day we didnt wish
to make camp on and on over a stony
plain we wnt through the hot hours of
the afternoon

  there was not a sign of life no ani-
mals of any kind no birds we saw one
insect at a stop made necessary by the
slipping bags on a camel we saw a
scorpion ahmed mansour had a small
circular bit of looking-glass about two
inches across and he annoyed the scor-
pion by placing this in front of the in-
sect and watching the antics of the
wicked thing who thought he was up
against an enemy as big and ugly as him-
self again and again the scorpion
lashed the bit of glass with his tail

  we traveled at the rate of three miles
an hour and we were tired and thirsty
when we made camp in a depression in
the plain where there was a small patch
of dried grass that the camels could eat
the atmosphere was so dry that sparks
came from our hair when we combed it
eerie was that place-when the night
wind came up it played sad tunes on
every bit of canvas it could find tunes
that fought the horrible silence

it was anastasia who was the first to
hear the song she cried out to thur-
land and the rest of us sat up and
listened the hairy man who was acting
as guard for the early part of the night
had fallen asleep from weariness and
flane shook him awake

  standing outside the tents we listened
the song came up on the wind from the
southward and for a few minutes what
with the noise we made we could not
distinguish the words suddenly the
hairy man unloosed a cry of joy and
rushed out across the plain shouting

  its haila he screamed its haila
singing the song of the woman with
golden feet  

 the hairy man was right it was
haila singing the strange thrilling song
our ears drank it in for in the thick
blackness it seemed a magical chant
and although we knew that it was the
dwarf singing it there came a little fear
lest some spirit of the waste was fooling
us by chanting it in an effort to lure us
to destruction for the night had a


the blue book magazine

 saving him from the anger of the caid
 and the villagers then he fell on a rug
 and went to sleep ahmed mansour re-
 lieved the hairy man from guard duty
 and we went back to our own blankets
 the return of the dwarf cheered us great-
 ly the song that h sang brought a be-
 lief that was indescribable

last over the wall came a big man
dark and burly if ever a man was
born to be a killer it was that
one-eyed moor

we were up at dawn thurland having
decided that we would march on through
the early hours of the day and make
camp when the rays of the sun became
unbearable and the finding of the dwarf
had something to do with the early
start for said thurland the par-
don was given to the bunch of us that
were prisoners but it wasnt given to the
dwarf we might have to fight another
duel to get him loose if the caid should
catch up to us

he saw the fear come into the face of
anastasia when he made that remark
and he flung his arms around her and
kissed her dont fear he said we
will not be harmed didnt i tell you
that the wise woman at el kantara saw
me with the masque of death in my
hands though she didnt know that i
was hunting for it at the time and if
she saw me with it how can i be killed
before i get my hands on it

  but the fear stayed with anastasia-
fighting the words that thurland fired at
her in an effort to cheer her up   

  we passed three mud huts that morn-
ing the people saw us coming and
rushed inside barring the doors behind
them a goat was left bleating in the
sunshine and we wanted the goat we
beat at the door and shouted to the
owners telling them that we would pay
a good price for the animal but we got
no answer instead a knife was thrust
through a crack ii the wall and nearly

strange terror in it and the events of the
day had left our nerves raw and jumpy

 ahmed mansour had followed the
hairy man across the wastes and we
built up the fire so they could find the
camp again thurland flane anastasia
and i stood by the fire waiting now and
then a shout from the hairy man came
back to us but the shout didnt reach
the ears of the singer on account of the
wind blowing in our direction

  the dwarf is a mile away said
flane you can hear the ticking of a
watch fifty yards off they wont be
back for an hour

  flane was right it was a full hour
before the hairy man and ahmed man-
sour returned the wrestler carrying the
poor dwarf on his back

  haila was weary but he was quite
cheerful after he had drank a quart of
scalding coffee he thanked thurland for
caravan treasure



gashed the face of the hairy man who
was trying to look into the interior at
the moment

  ahmed mansour wanted to take the
goat without bothering to speak to the
owners but my uncle thurland wouldnt
let him so we rode on half a mile be-
yond we looked back the hut dwellers
were outside now watching us but the
moment flane turned his camel as if to
go back they dashed inside again bang-
ing the doors behind them

  a weird strange land this through
which we were moving a land of terror
a dead land the moors said ahmed
mansour trying to explain the country
only wish to see two things in move-
ment running water and running french
soldiers all else they wish to rest as
it is

  we made camp an hour before mid-
day thurland and flane and the hairy
man studied the maps we were beyond
the draa in a line with cap juby and
twenty-eight degrees north of the equator
the dwarf haila who had journeyed
farther south when he was younger
assured my uncles that we w-ould reach
a small oasis in the morning there we
would be able to buy provisions

it wras nearly five oclock in the aft-
ernoon when we saw the camel cara-
van ahmed mansour was the first to
catch sight of it and when he pointed to
it we thought that it was a mirage mov-
ing eastward between us and the horizon
was a snaky line for till the world like an
enormous serpent moving in a cloud of
yellow dust

  camels cried ahmed

  my uncles were standing together
staring at the far-ofr line there was
something sinister in that line

  raiders muttered flane

  thurland had the glasses on the mov-
ing serpent and he nodded as he handed
them to his brother theyve got pris-
oners he said scores of them  were
lucky if we were camped a mile ahead
we might have joined the chain-gang
lucky they cant see us the big dune
hides us and the sui is in their eyes
all the same we had better get back a
little

  hurriedly we moved into a mass of
rocks and there crouched on our knees
we watched the company of raiders flane
passed the glasses to anastasia who
passed them to me with the glasses we
could clearly see the captives walking on
foot whipped along by the camel-riders

  the head of the enormous serpent
moved over the edge of the plain camels
and captives it pulled its tail after it
the glasses showed only a cloud of dust
made golden by the rays of the setting
sun

  and as we watched the dust-cloud our
thoughts upon the poor wretches that
were whipped along by the raiders we
got a surprise from the rocks behind
us came a sound of convulsive sobbing
and when we turned quickly a girl of
some twenty years completely nude rose
from the shelter of a boulder and came
toward us

  it was to anastasia that she ran-
anastasia into whose big eyes had come
all the pity of the world as they fell
upon that naked dusty figure

  in an instant anastasia had pulled the
crying girl into the tent while we swung
our faces to the dust-cloud looking for a
raider to come in pursuit of the escaped
slave and a hatred of the camel-train
was upon us at that moment a hatred of
it and the country where it was possible
to traffic in flesh and blood

  my uncles swore softly and the hairy
man clucked ahmed mansour and the
dwarf looked from time to time at the
flap of the tent through which the girl
had disappeared and although i was
young i didnt wonder for the quick
glimpse that they had of the girl showed
them that she was beautiful

  theyll miss her when they make
camp said flane shes too darned
pretty to escape without anyone noticing
it

  thurland took the glasses and turned
them on the golden dust-cloud theyve
missed her already he said theres
her owner riding back on the trail

  in the minutes that followed we
learned that the girl had broke from the
caravan at a point directly in line with
our position although she had not seen
the tents she had run madly in search
of shelter and by pure luck had entered
the rocky gully at one end of which was
our camp

  together we watched the lone rider
coming over the plain he followed the
track of the caravan riding fast as if try-
ing to pick up the tracks of the girl be-
fore the night fell

we lost sight of him after he passed
the point where we had first seen
the raiders appear on the horizon and we
breathed a sigh of relief as he disap-
peared the night was coming down on


the blue book magazine

the desert and now it would be difficult
to find the spot where the girl had broken
away from the mob of prisoners thur-
land gave this opinion to the dwarf and
the dwarf translated it to the girl who
had now come out of the tent dressed
in a loose gown that anastasia had put
around her body

  theyve been cruel to her said
anastasia the marks of a whip are
on her back and legs

  the devils growled thurland the
hellish devils

  we sat in the dusk fearful to light a
fire lest it might bring the camel-rider
down upon us the girl sat close to
anastasia clinging to her dress as if the
very touch of her robe would bring pro-
tection i know that all of us were
thinking of that enormous serpent made
of camels and slaves that had passed be-
fore us like something seen in a night-
mare africa was exposing herself to us

  there are fools said flane quietly
who talk about the conquest of africa
they blabber in london and paris of
how the continent is opened up they
made me sick africa is the place where
the devil thinks out all his tricks and
itll be a vast secret to the whites at the
end of another thousand years yes and
at the end of another ten thousand for
one of these days theyll push us-

my uncle flane halted there and for
a good reason down on us like
a specter rushed a plush-footed camel
right into the midst of the group and
while we scattered before the rush of the
beast the rider slipped from his saddle
and ran toward the girl his sword wav-
ing to keep us at a distance

  it was ahmed mansour who stopped
the rush of the big brute who had ridden
in on us throwing himself nearly flat
to dodge the waving sword the wrestler
flung out his right leg and kicked the
moor violently in the shins the big
fellow went down the sword flew out of
his hands and before he could get to his
knees ahmed mansour was on him with
the leap of an enraged panther he
caught him with a crotch hold lifted
him into the air for a second he bal-
anced himself then he hurled the moor
head-foremost against the rocks

  the slaver lay where he fell thurland
walked quietly to his side turned him over
and felt his heart the fellow was dead

  there were four bald-headed vultures
following us all the day clucked the
hairy man now i know what for

  well strike camp said thurland
it would be madness to stay here

  while we were getting things ready
the arab spoke to flane in an under-
tone as if he was making an apology for
killing the slaver we had to have
another camel for the girl he said

  flane didnt answer we moved off
into the velvety night southward ever
southward to the place where the woman
with golden feet waited for fools we
were silent ant a litile depressed

chapter xiv

the beleaguered village

we made camp in the morning at the
edge of what must have been a
dried-up salt marsh for the sun glistened
on the particles of salt so that you
couldnt look at it and the four bald-
headed vultures were there with six
mates that they had picked up some-
where in the night

  the hairy man and the dwarf set out
for a village that was on the other side
of the salt marsh they had the inten-
tion of riding to within a half kilometer
of the place then ihe hairy man would
creep into the souk and buy the food
that we wanted the vultures watched
them go looked at each other for a few
seconds then decided to stay in camp

  my uncle flane thought that the birds
were watching one of the camels the
moors think that a vulture knows days
and days before the death of a camel
that the beast is going to die the bird
watches the walk cf the camel the way
a fighter at the finish of a round turns
and watches the legs of his antagonist as
he goes back to his corner if the legs
wabble its a great sign

  we sat in the liztle patches of shade
and waited for the hairy man and the
dwarf and africa boiled and blazed in
the cruel heat-bo led and blazed with
the dry bare belly of her stretched to
the sun the mind reeled as one pictured
it the great distances without shelter
or water our eyes turned southward
pictured them the rio de oro senegal
french guinea sierra leone liberia
ivory coast gold coast dahomey
nigeria the congo and the great strip
of wild land running down to the cape

  and the whole damned lot of it hasnt
the value of an inch of kerry said
flane suddenly

  whats not worth an inch of kerry
asked thurland
caravan treasure



  you know snapped flane
thurland laughed and threw a rock at
the vultures the stone passed within
a foot of one of them but he didnt
move he croaked softly to a companion
a croak that might have been a curse
thrown at thurland

  the hairy man and the dwarf didnt
come back till late in the afternoon they
came at a fast trot and the moment they
pulled up they started to scream out the
news with the two of them talking at
once we could not understand a word
but thurland silencec the dwarf and the
hairy man got the floor

  there was so the hairy one told us
the devil of a fuss immediately ahead of
us the village to which they had gone
was partly surrounded by a crowd of
robbers and pillagers that had come up
from the southward the raiding mob
had stolen every canel they could lay
their hands on and now they intended
to sack the village and carry away the
young women it was in the moorish
language a baroud and a terrible one

  we can swing away to the eastward
said thurland isnt it possible

  the hairy man shook his head it ap-
peared that the road southward passed
through a narrow defle with steep cliffs
on either side and the marauders held
this defile with hundreds of armed men
so that we hadnt a chance of getting
through unless we paid thousands and
thousands of francs lor permission

  and that because im irish im not
going to do said thurland the irish
dont pay for roadway

  the sheik of the village is friendly
said the hairy man hes so frightened
that hed like to talk to anyone that
hates the robbers i went in and spoke
to him the hairy one waited for a
minute his eyes upon thurland then he
added in a weak voice i told him of
you i told of your fight with the caid
thurland grinned he being amused
by the bragging of the hairy man he
walked apart with flane the two of them
standing in the hot sunshine their faces
turned to the south

now i think that the madness-for
it was a madness-came upon my
two uncles on that afternoon-came upon
them as they talked together consider-
ing the story told by the hairy man up
to that moment they had taking con-
sideration of their ancestry exercised a
certain amount of caution in their move-
ments but from that afternoon on they

considered neither their safety nor the
safety of those that were with them
they had one thought only in their
minds and that was to get to that spot
in the terrible wastes where the woman
with golden feet watched over the cara-
van treasure the plunder of the ages
they were taken up by the glamour and
the wonder of the story and nothing else
mattered nothing at all

  they were in a world apart a sort of
frightening ambition was upon them and
logic was thrown to the winds possibly
all men who have done wonderful things
since the world began have been victims
of this same mad ambition it creeps
into their heads on some fine day
strangling all the other little-desires if
the man loves play it strangles that
love if he loves drink it does the same
it throttles his liking for books and
horses and if women are in the way of
the dream the desire is pinched and
pinched till it dies the death

  it is then that the ambition flames
he is in labor to it like the great marco
polo who had cathay in his head like
the great franklin who could think of
nothing but the northwest passage like
mungo park who lost his life in trying
to find whether the river niger ran to
the west or the east like brave scott
who got to the pole and died coming
back with his fine companions about him

so my uncles thurland and flane be-
came like those others on that after-
noon by the edge of the dried salt marsh
the thing in their minds screamed for
birth and they forgot everything else
even anastasia whom thurland loved
with a great love was forgotten in the
business of getting delivery of the desire
they had bred and africa grinned at
them and encouraged them-blew her
hot breath on their madness and flung
up pictures of what they would do when
the swaddling-thing of the devil was in
their arms   

  the dusk came down on the sprawling
body of africa then as the night thick-
ened little pinpoints of light broke
through the darkness in front of us--
miles in front of us they were the
watch-fires of the looters who were
camped around the village hundreds
of them they ran like a chain of yellow
topazes across the night warning us that
we couldnt pass and thurland and
flane stood and cursed them

  can we get into the village thur-
land asked of the hairy man


the blue book magazine

  if you move at once said the hairy
one in the morning it will be too
late

  its our one chance said thurland
lets go

we circled the dried-up swamp the
hairy man and the dwarf leading us
the winking watchfires were plainer now
and the light from the coming moon
showed us the defile that was blocked
from us the great steep cliffs making it
impossible for us to go to the westward
or the eastward of it

  the high mud walls of the village rose
before us the hairy man slipped from
his camel and crept forward on all
fours we waited in the shadows till he
came back and whispered the news to
thurland

  they have ringed the place except for
a few yards at the bottom of the souk
he said if we have luck we can get
through before they block us

  we pushed forward toward the walls
guns were cracking now the people in
the village were firing from towers that
were set at different points along the
walls and the robbers by the camp-fires
were firing back and from out of the
village came yells and screams and
shouted orders

  once more the hairy one went forward
on all fours he came back hurriedly
and whispered to us we were to make
a quick dash for a closed door in the
walls and if allah was kind we would
reach it without a bit of lead in our
bodies the door would swing open the
moment we reached it he had arranged
a signal

  still on our camels we reached the
edge of the danger zone then at a word
from thurland we charged the wall
where the gate showed a blacker mass
than the rest of the tinted mud barrier

  bullets whizzed around us the camel
of the dwarf went headlong screaming
as it fell the dwarf picked himself up
grabbed at the stirrup of flanes saddle
and swung there the cries and yells
increased thurland shouted encourage-
ment he was riding beside anastasia
urging her mount forward

  the great wooden door swung open as
we reached the wall in a shouldering
rush we swept through it knocking over
a dozen villagers who couldnt get out of
the way of the frightened and angry
camels that bit and kicked at everyone
within reach a mad entry the clamor
was deafening a craziness brought by

the fear of death had clutched the people
they howled in chorus and the narrow
lanes were so packed with men and
women and goats and sheep and camels
that once inside we could hardly move

  but the hairy man had spread some
wild tale about thurland spillane that
brought us a passage with flaming
torches lighting the way and with a
thousand people shouting at us we were
led toward the house of the sheik never
did i hear such an uproar from the
yells and screams i imagined that the
people thought thurland had come to
deliver them from the plunderers and
looking at my uncle as he rode at the
head of the line i could well understand
why they thought so huge and kingly
was thurland in the flickering light of
the torches full of a confidence that he
had built up to feed the longing that
was in his soul-the longing to see the
woman with golden feet

  through the packed streets from
which rose a stench of men and beasts
we reached the hoase of the sheik we
were pulled from cur camels and pushed
within i clinging to the hand of anas-
tasia who watched thurland with fear
in her fine eyes on a sort of as
covered with sheepskins sat the sheik of
the village a small fat man who was
gray with terror he had drawn his
legs up under him so that he looked like
a round ball and he rocked himself back-
ward and forward as messages came to
him about the work of the looters out-
side the walls

thurland aid flane shoulder to
shoulder each taller than any other
man in the place walked toward the
sheik who looked at them with a sort of
reverence in his eyes and the men
around him bowed to my two uncles and
the people outside in the street yelled
then and there we understood  the hairy
man had traded  a prophecy made by
an old woman in ihe village years be-
fore she had foretold that two white
men who were tall and strong would
come down from the north and save the
village when it was attacked by robbers
-and here were the men big and
strong without a doubt and filled with
a courage that was born of a mad desire
a courage that made them invincible

  cool were thur and and flane with
a calm that was surprising they took
charge of things the sheik was left to
rock backward and forward on his sheep-
skins while my uncles talked with men
caravan treasure



who looked like fighters men with
wicked eyes and hard sinewy hands

  thurland and flane and the hairy
man and ahmed mansour began to pick
and choose among the men of the vil-
lage here and there they pulled a man
out of the mob and placed him in line
the women and the children were pushed
inside the houses and the street cleared

  anastasia and the slave girl whose
name was chema were taken into the
house of the sheik but i watched my
uncles-watched and wondered at the
effect they had on the frightened people
for courage came cut of thurland and
flane a flood of it that pounded on the
fears and killed them a courage that
straightened the backs of the men and
brought the lust to kill into their eyes
and that was the miracle of the night-
the miracle that was brought by the
madness for treasure for my uncles
didnt care a tinkers dam for the lives
of the men women and children of the
village they only wanted a path south-
ward   

  when some hundreds of men had been
chosen they were divided them into four
groups thurland had one flane an-
other the hairy man the third and
ahmed mansour had the fourth and it
was then that they were told of the
plan they were told to put their guns
aside but to carry their poniards they
would drop over the watls instead of
leaving by the gates and like creeping
leopards they would go here and there
noiselessly and stab wherever they found
a robber off-guard or asleep stab hard
and silently

  a lot of them will be sleeping now
said thurland and none will think you
have the courage to come out at them
youll move quietly and alone each to
his own business for it is the silent man-
ner of your killing that will fool them
and the man who brings me back the

greatest number of amulets shall ride
with me and shall be the richest man in
the country lets go

  with my heart threatening to strangle
me i watched them drop over the walls
into the darkness and the village was
quiet the old men the children and the
women whispering together and the
heavy night sat down on the place and
brought fears that were indescribable

  i found my way back to the house of
the chief and sat with anastasia-sat
there in the dark and each minute that
passed brought running men to tell the
sheik what was happening outside the
walls of his village and anastasia
quivered with fear as each runner came
in she thinking of thurland and the
manner he had of taking the lead in any
fight that was on for if anyone in the
world loved fighting with a great love
it was my uncle thurland spillane   

  i left anastasia and went to the south
wall of the village men were coming
back one by one and with others i
helped to drag them up over the wall
hoping that each one that came up out of
the darkness would be thurland the
men were quarreling over the number of
robbers they had killed showing each
other the amulets and charms that they
had taken from them for the talk of
thurland and the belief that he had
come according to the prophecy had
made fine murderers of them and they
had done things that they had never
done before because they lacked the
courage

  thurland and flane came at last also
the hairy man and ahmed mansour and
then the quarreling broke out anew for
a great desire was upon the crowd to go
with thurland one and all fought for
the honor they thinking that he had
some strange magic about him and this
belief being supported by the gri-gri man
of the village an old villain who was


the blue book magazine

quick to see which way the tide was
running

 the men who had made the raid
fought to get close to thurland to exhibit
the trophies and they screamed asser-
tions about their bravery but they
were all silenced by a one-eyed man who
came last over the wall a big man
dark of skin and burly in whose single
eye sat death yes death and bloody
murder if ever a man was born to be
a killer it was that one-eyed moor

  he thrust the others to the right and
left and he faced thurland laying down
the proofs before him and although i
couldnt see the proofs i saw the sur-
prise on the face of my uncle

  the moor was speaking to thurland
in his own tongue many of them had
no amulets he said but you can see
by looking at these that i killed them
my uncle flane was sitting on the
wall some distance away and thurland
called out to him theres a bit of a
fighter here he said the beggar cut
off their right ears when he found they
had no amulets

  flane laughed youd better take
him he said its a tough country
and were a long way from your lady
love with the golden feet

  so thurland patted the shoulder of
the one-eyed man to show the others
that he was the chosen and the fellow
grinned i was a little afraid of the one-
eyed man because i thought he loved
murder for its own sake but he was a
brave fellow as we found out later

at daybreak the robbers were still
 around the village but a lot of the
swagger had been knocked out of them
by the raid in the night they kept
away from the walls taking cover from
the sharpshooters that thurland and
flane posted at advantageous points

  at midday the robbers showed a white
flag and they sent a man forward to de-
mand a parley the chief of the gang
wished to talk with thurland

  its a trick said flane dont go
out to him they think that if they
wiped you out theyd take the village
he cannot hurt me said thurland
and unarmed he went out through the
main gate of the village and the chief
came forward-a huge man with em-
broidered robes the two stood within
five yards of each other the robber
shouting his questions and thurland re-
plying in a loud voice so that those on
the walls heard everything

  in the temajegh tongue the robber
demanded one hundred camels for that
number he would raise the siege and
start northward

  thurland laughed and shook his head

  fifty camels cried the chief

  no nor fifty shouted thurland

  the chief moved closer and i saw that
my uncle flane became tense and
watchful

  give twenty cried the chief and
there was wild fury on his face

  no not one  replied thurland and
as he said the words the chief mad with
temper and forgetful of danger pulled a
dagger from his cloak and rushed

  it was flane who fired the shot that
stopped him-flane who had him cov-
ered from the moment that the talk be-
gan a great marksman was my uncle
flane the bullet passed through the
throat of the robber chief and he fell
dead at the feet cf thurland by a
miracle thurland gained the gate through
a hail of bullets

  the fight was on again the robbers
firing volleys from every bit of shelter
they could find but the heart had gone
out of them at the death of the chief and
the bloody work that had been done in
the darkness of the night

  in the late afternoon they commenced
to move streaming northward in a long
line and it was i hen that the raided
became raiders for the people of the
village on foot and on camels started
after them like a swarm of hornets and
whenever a robber lagged behind he was
butchered

  the night came down but the vil-
lagers clung to the line and every now
and then a man would come back tri-
umphant carrying a rifle and the robes
of the man he had killed a few brought
back camels they bragged of their
deeds so that the clamor was frightful
and there were fights over the rifles and
the clothing-tremendous fights and
africa listened africa that bred the
hate and the cruelty

chapter xv

  in the hut of the one-eyed man

the one-eyed man who had won the
right to go along with us was a
clever fellow on the morning follow-
ing the departure of the raiders he
begged my uncles to walk with him to a
house in the village

  and why asked thurland
caravan treasure



  the man stood on one leg and then on
the other a little bashful before the keen
eyes of thurland spillane

  there is in the house i live in be-
gan the man speaking in his own tongue
the woman who has made the prophecy
of your coming she wishes to see you
and to mark the road that your feet will
tread and in the house is a picture
that you might like to see

  i know where im going said thur-
land the track is marked

  in the desert there are no marks
said the man softly the jinn of the
waste wipe them out with their hot
breaths

  lets see her said flane she made
a clever guess about our coming and
he laughed when he said that

so the one-eyed moor led the way
my uncles and i followed the morn-
ing sun hit the mud huts they cracked
with the fierce heat of it so that you
could hear the noises as you shuffled
along the narrow lanes and in the
cracks were little green lizards that
flashed in the sun from the dark door-
ways men and women cried out to thur-
land thinking him a savior

  the one-eyed man dived into a dark
doorway and we followed feeling our
way in the gloom the man spoke to
some one whom we couldnt see and we
were led through the first room to one in
the rear that was lighted by a single
window here sat the old woman rock-
ing herself backward and forward on a
stool

  when thurland came into the room
she had made an attempt to stand up
but she was too old she was the oldest
woman i have ever seen her age came
out from her and pushed against her so
that we were a little afraid

  the one-eyed man spread a mat on
the dirt floor and we sat down upon it
the old woman looked at thurland her
eyes blinking like those of  owl then
she signaled to the moor

  he brought into the room a calabash
of clear water a bunch of fennel and a
white rooster the old woman placed
the calabash before her dipped the fen-
nel into the water then neatly cut the
neck of the rooster and allowed a few
drops of the blood to fall into the cala-
bash    the silence of the room grew
and grew it went out from the place
boring into the desert and a strange
feeling came upon us a feeling that
something invisible oad entered the

place something that knew of us knew
our business and where we were going
ay and didnt approve of it at all that
is what we felt

  the hag motioned with her hand to my
uncle thurland-motioned to him that
he should look in the calabash of water
thurland thrust his head forward and
looked face over the calabash he looked
and what he saw drew his head down
and down and the choking silence was so
great that i wanted to scream for
whatever it was that my uncle saw he
was startled in a queer manner

  the hag waved her hand and thur-
land sat upright with a little sigh of re-
lief then she signaled to flane and
flane leaned forward so that he could
look into the calabash and he gurgled
in his excitement like a baby

  flane drew back and the old woman
looked at thurland before inviting me to
take a peep thurland nodded and i
pushed myself across the mat to peep in-
to the calabash my lips and throat dry
with excitement

  for a minute i saw nothing then the
picture formed before my eyes there
was a slope of black rock that glittered
like basalt and on the top of this rock
was a huge figure a seated woman with
her hands above her head her face flat
like the face of a negress her legs bare
and her ankles and feet shone yellow in
the water shone yellow like gold

  the old woman uttered one word the
arabic mout which means death a
warning she was giving to thurland and
flane and the presence in the room
the invisible presence tried to push home
that warning africa was threatening us

  the hag made a few passes over the
calabash and signaled to thurland and
as thurland looked there came a soft
smile on his face flane looked in his
turn and he grinned in the manner of
thurland then it was my turn

i put my head over the calabash and
the flood of joy that came upon me
made me cry out for i saw in the
clouded water the picture of my home
-my home on the road from glengariff
to kenmare there like a fine painting
done in soft tints of brown and gold
was the green tree farm where i was
born and raised true to every little de-
tail the gate leading up from the road
the little windows the barn at the back
and beyond that again the waving trees
and the old mill from which one can see
the beauty of the valley of the sheen


the blue bok magazine

  i stared at the picture till my eyes
filled with tears so that i could see it
no longer and when i wiped the tears
away it had disappeared thurland
spoke to me as i looked up

  its just a trick jimmy he said
ive seen it done before

  the hag spoke in her own tongue she
said and that is life thurland
translated the words to me a grin upon
his face you should have stayed at
home jimmy he said -in sweet
kerry where there is peace and comfort
and nice things to eat and drink

  i couldnt i stammered

  then youve got to put up with the
hard jabs that come to you he said

flane tossed a few coins to the hag
and we followed the moor into
another room to see the picture he had
spoken of

  on the mud wall fastened there by
four brass-headed nails was the picture
of the woman that we had seen in the
calabash of water the body tinted a
flesh-color the feet and ankles yellow-
a bright yellow to show that they were
gold

  thurland sprang forward his face
was close to the drawing flane was be-
side him muttering gaelic curses the
drawing upset them and well it might
for the first time they looked upon a
sketch of the woman with golden feet
who was dragging them through the
wastes-dragging them to their death
according to the hag in the next room

  the drawing was done on a square of
dried sheepskin it was i learned later
not the work of an artist the man who
drew it knew nothing of perspective
but his ignorance of art didnt stop him
from putting his dream into line and
color without the training and instruc-
tion it had come the fingers tracing the
features as seen in the dream and in
some curious way putting into them all
the lure that he had seen there while
dreaming

 the woman of the sheepskin was
breastless but the form was feminine
the legs were long and beautiful and
the upraised arms were graceful but it
was the face itself that held us the
strange face for the man who had made
the picture had by some trick that might
have come from his very ignorance of
art put into the wide-open eyes a mag-
netic quality that was unexplainable

  for a long while my uncles stared at
the drawing then slowly they drew

back from it and aked questions-ques-
tions uttered in whispers their eyes up-
on the picture

 who made it and when

  now much of what the moor answered
i gathered from the comments of thur
land and flane for they not content in
hearing the story in the moors tongue
turned his words into english and mum-
bled them as a sort of chorus to each
other as he went  with the tale

  in the gloomy room the tale wrapped
itself around us like threads around a
spool-the very devil of a tale we
had found a link with the man who had
written the song lhat the dwarf sang
the song of treasure

  this soldier of la ligion etrangere
had passed through the village on his
way southward alone and on foot his
camel having died in the wastes over
which he had come and he was mad
the devils of the big sands had burned
the brain of him and he was a shouting
lunatic led forward by the woman he had
dreamed of the woman with golden
feet

  the one-eyed man described him to
thurland and flane as a big blond man
who knew no fear the moor was doubt-
ful about his nationality he didnt think
him french for h was too blond and
too big german perhaps

  in imagination we pictured him a big
brute of a man storming down through
the wastes singing as he walked singing
so that the people in the mud huts
thought him mad driving ever south-
ward chanting his wild song the jackals
of the desert answering him

  jimmy said thurland go and find
the dwarf and brirg him here

 i went and found the dwarf and
brought him back to where my uncles
waited

  listen said thurland halting the
one-eyed man in his story is this the
song that the blond soldier sang and
saying that he nodded to the dwarf
bidding him sing the verses

no need was there to ask the one-eyed
man if it was tlje same song his
face answered the question he beat
time to it with his big hands and he
joined in on the ciorus thundering out
the temajegh words

  it seemed that he people of the vil-
lage thought that the blond giant was
afflicted by allah they were kind to
him though they were a little frightened
by the song the moor had given him
caravan treasure



food and drink and allowed him to sleep
in the room in which we then stood and
he was so intrigued by the song and the
picture that he went on with him for
seven days he had ridden into the desert
then the madness of the soldier had
frightened him and he turned but the
blond giant went on he had no fear

and for reward the ligionaire had
 given the moor the drawing on the
piece of sheepskin and now seeing the
desire in thurlands eyes the one-eyed
man took the tacks from the picture and
handed it to thurland

  you will carry t he said you
have the same madness that was upon
him that gave it to me the same look
is in your eyes

  the words frightened me for i too
thought that a madness was coming up-
on my uncle thurland and what i saw
was fattened by the presentation of the
picture for every time thurland looked
at the picture of the breastless woman
she looked at him and put her magic on
him her terrible magic

  the sheik wished us to stay he being
afraid that the robbers would return
but the feet of my two uncles were of
quicksilver and could not keep still and
the drawing prodded them prodded them
the way the finger cf the devil prodded
old tommy flaherty when he stole the
poorbox from kenmare church

  and the one-eyed man dug out of his
memory stories that the mad soldier had
told him on their journey tremendous
stories that the white sunshine gave life
to for doubt couldnt exist in that
land thurland listened to the stories
polished them in his own way and told
them to us and anastasia and i be-
lieved them though we were afraid
stories of gems that had slipped from
one hand to another through the dead
centuries from the hands of kings and
emperors to the soft silken fingers of
courtesans that they loved and from
the fingers of the same courtesans to ad-
venturous devils they admired and from
them to the gambler or to better-fight-
ing devils who took them with the
sword-point now and then the church
got them a fat cardinal receiving them
as payment for shriving the soul of a
scoundrel on his deathbed

  there was no one on gods sweet earth
who could tell a story of treasure like
my uncle thurland for he used words

that were like crushed opals they fall-
ing from his tongue and building up be-
lief with the color and sheer beauty of
them

  half the treasure that was ever lost to
the world lay south of us so said thur-
land where else would it be

  do you think youd find it in eng-
land or ireland cried thurland when
anastasia uttered little words of doubt
england where the jews strain the
mud of whitechapel through their fingers
in search of a lost hapenny ireland
where theyve dug in every boreen
thinking theyd find enough to buy a pint
of porter no its in a place like this
where the devil has hidden it away-and
where brave hearts are wanted to search
for it

  where cried thurland are the fine
big emeralds that john of brienne who
was once emperor of jerusalem took
from the turks when he mowed them
down by the thousand

  and i who had never heard of john of
brienne sat open-mouthed when he put
the question but thurland knew of
old john of brienne a paladin of pala-
dins who loved and fought when he was
four-score and eight

  and where he demanded are the
great treasures that the templars gath-
ered the jewels of nureddin that
blazed so brightly that you could read
by the light -that came from them the
devils own quantity of stuff has been
carted down here and hidden hidden
for years and years and years

 we couldnt contradict him we
could say nothing when that husky voice
of his boomed questions at us

the sheik gave us fresh camels he
being very pleased with thurland and
flane he gave us also pack camels that
he loaded with native rice and ground-
nuts and millet and dried dates and on
the afternoon of the day we saw the hag
and the drawing we rode out of the vil-
lage-thurland and flane anastasia the
arab wrestler the hairy man the dwarf
the slave-girl who refused to stay behind
the one-eyed moor and i we rode out of
the gate with all the men women and
children screaming good-bys to us some
added a prayer to allah for our safety
knowing in their minds that we needed
as much protection as allah could spare
and in that belief they showed their
wisdom

this story of a hazardous quest beyond the sahara
com -s to its great climax in our forthcoming june issue

rairte

when i lived with my
parents on a homestead
the dakota prairies were
just being settled our
home was a sod house dug
partly into the side of a
hill where snows of the long winter
drifted completely over the top of it

   in summer there was always a prairie-
fire menace the long buffalo grass
made a fire which would sweep swiftly
across the prairie faster than a man
could run my father usually plowed a
few furrows but did not backfire unless
it was necessary

   one day in early fall my father took
me to town and bought me a new duck
coat-quite an event in the afternoon
we were returning and were now about
six miles from home

  a dry thunderstorm blew up and
passed by not far to the north of us
soon after it had blown on across the
hills we saw a column of smoke spiral-
ing high above the buttes to our left
and drifting swiftly toward us i

   lightning must have started a fire
said father anxiously winds blowing
that smoke right toward home too 

   he whipped the horses up as the smoke
changed to billowing clouds which rolled
ominously over the prairie

  before we reached home he had the
horses in a gallop the fire quickly
spread until it was rolling toward us
both from behind and to our left i re-
member watching fathers tense anxious
face with a sort of wondering fear yet
wholly confident that he would see that
everything came out all right

   i remember seeing mother waiting for
us out by the trail which ran near the
house seeing her dimly through the
smoke while we were still some distance
off increased my eerie feeling i won-
dered why there were tears in her eyes
as she kissed me and dad

       in this department we print
       each month the best five
       true stories contributed by
       our readers for details of
       this contest see page 

  as he stood with his hands on her
shoulders and looked into her eyes he
seemed tall and proud of her when she
said i drove the cattle into the bare
lot and took the colt out of the stable
but i was afraid to set a backfire be-
cause i was afraid you might not get
through it

  i knew i could depend on you mary
he said

mother looked kind of pleased and
happy even though she was worried
quickly father gave instructions
you start a backfire around the
stable and stacks ill take the plow to
those stacks beyor d the ridge and try
to backfire before the fire gets to them
they looked toward the ridge and al-
ready the fire was coming over it

  you cant get to those stacks dear
that fire will cut them off in a few
minutes fearfulh she pled with him

  ive got to mary-or we cant keep
our stock this winte r  the pasture will be
gone now ill go through the fire where
it is burning cross-wind-the blaze wont
be quite so high

  as mother looked at him her face
was white pleading dear- she
hesitated seemed thinking then all
right she said and kissed him

  get me a bunch of sacks out of the
granary son and mother can start a
backfire while you are gone ill load
up the plow

  i ran to do his bidding hastily dad
ripped a sack wet the pieces and
fastened them to the bridles so they
covered the horses nostrils he tied his
wet handkerchief over his own face then
threw the sacks in a bucket of water
and set them in the wagon he had
loaded the plow while i was after the
sacks grabbing tie handful of matches
which mother gave him he started the
horses on a gallop toward the blaze roar-
ing down from the ridge while mother



 meal ex-

fire

a relatively commonplace episode
made memorable in the telling-

by john clayton

stood with her arms around me and stared
after him with anxious and pallid face

 as the wagon went bouncing and
rumbling out of the yard our old dog
rover dashed after it barking in wild
excitement father shouted at him to
go back and finally threw the plow-
wrench at him but rover followed al-
most into the blaze

  father turned to wave his hand at us
as he disappeared ino smoke and flame
mother sort of sobbed as her arms
tightened around me if he won through
he must still go through a second line of
flame to reach the stacks and then might
not have time to set a backfire before
the red terror caught up with him again

  suddenly mother came to life the
hystacks jackie she cried

we wet our sacks in the tank and
raced to the furrows around the stacks

with trembling hands she started a
blaze on the side of the furrows toward
the wind with our wet sacks we kept
the blaze small and running each way
along the furrow on the side away
from us we let it burn to meet the on-
rushing prairie fire

  it was only a hundred yards away
now but our backfire was spreading
rapidly before the barn lot with our
wet sacks we desperately kept abreast of
it and beat out any flames which leaped
the furrows the cattle were bawling in
terror so that we were afraid they would
break away but finally the worst was
over as the flames began o burn out in
our backfire with the wind shifting
slightly it raced around us and swept
like a hurricane acrcss the prairie on a
veritable island it left us-surrounded by
a smoking sea of black

  tears were streaking the grime on
mothers face as she looked toward the
blackened ridge

  apparently mother could stand the
suspense no longer for she said come

perxence s

 on jackie and started toward the
 ridge trail which led to the distant hay-
 stacks the thunders mutterings had
 changed to heavy rumblings and the
 sky was growing blacker

  at about where we saw father dis-
 appear in the flames we found the
 charred wagon end-gate where it had
 evidently bounced out in the mad gallop
 beside it lay my new duck coat prac-
 tically unharmed-a freak of the fire
 providence often looks out for little
 boys

 just then father drove over the ridge
 the horses were singed and sweating
 and looked as though they could hard-
 ly stand he kissed mothers tear-stained
 face and his too was black with grime
 the air which had become still and
 sultry began moving in a fresh cool
 breeze the smell of rain seemed to
 clear the smoke from the air a mile or
 two to the east the inferno was rushing
 on toward the horizon leaving black
 desolation in its wake

   i plowed a furrow then backfired
 around the largest stack but the fire
 beat me to the other

   oh dan i dont mind the hay so
 much now you are safe-you are safe 
 she threw her arm around his neck
 well he replied quietly as they
 looked into each others eyes well just
 sell a cow or two-and raise that much
 more next year

   he took off his battered hat as rain-
 drops began falling-kicking up puffs
 of black soot like bullets striking-wel-
 come bullets shot from heaven to de-
 stroy the red terror

   as i remember that was always their
 spirit in a land where crop failures
 averaged three years out of five

   yes we just had bad luck this year
 dan but its all right dear i know
 ell do better next year


eak wallah

 a british forester in siam contin-
 ues the graphic story of his work
 with big trees and big elephants

the great teak forests of northern
siam are worked mainly by british
firms operating under license from
the siamese government the logs ride
down the lonely rivers in order to reach
the sawmills of bangkok far away to the
south but before the trees can be felled
at all they have to be girdled or ringed
so that they may die and become buoy-
ant enough to float the work of girdling
is done by government forest officers
and one of the first jobs i had as a
junior teak-wallah was to inspect the
girdling on behalf of the firm that had
engaged me in order to see that no trees
were being missed

 when the cold weather was at its
height in january the siamese jungle
was perfect rather like an english wood
in spring with plenty of shade in spite
of the falling leaves a brilliant blue sky
above and a freshness in the air that
never allowed the shade temperature to
mount above  at two pm the hottest
part of the day directly the sun went
down the temperature fell with astonish-
ing rapidity and i had a huge log-fire
the size of a bonfire made up outside
my tent after dinner i would sit out
by it watching the sparks cascading into
the darkened wind-foaming jungle and
listening to the kettle which was to make
my toddy singing in the hot wood-ash

 gradually the days grew warmer and
the nights less chilly as the cold weather
merged into the hot the leaves were
nearly all off the trees by now and they
crackled frostily as one walked over
them jungle fires became frequent

 i was able to indulge in some rides
on my pony sunstar and these outings
in the cool of the evening were lovely
every now and then some creature of the
wild would flash across the road in front
of sunstars head a foxy-looking red
wild dog a gorgeously colored jungle-
cock a red squirrel a barking-deer and
once i saw a most extraordinary animal

it had the snout of a bear but since its
body ended iqa long bushy tail it looked
something like a cross between a hyena
and a south american ant-eater if such
could be imagined i saw it twice first
momentarily then in plain view quite
close to me for a good half-minute and
it could not have been any of the better-
known animals if anyone who reads
these lines could give me some idea as to
its identity i should be grateful

  now that the jungle was burnt-out i
became much more aware of bird-life
than before there were the black-and-
white plover that in places swarmed in
hordes and made the most tremendous
row at the slightest excuse-a rustle
in the undergrowth the scamper of some
gibbon in the tree-tops-they would rise
screaming then there were two species
of kingfisher one all blue and gold tfie
other a little spottec gray creature the
giant hornbill was fairly common and i
often heard his huge wings swishing
through the air and his raucous kok-
kok-kok as he alighted on some branch
it is his habit to wall his mate into a
tree at nesting-time a slight aperture
only being left through which he can
feed her-the idea being i suppose to
insure that she gets on with her job of
hatching the eggs

  green parrakeets and minas were com-
mon they both make good pets minas
especially being firsl-class imitators and
therefore good talkers doves and green
pigeon were also numerous the latter
having a lovely soft green plumage and
bright blue or bright red claws jungle-
fowl the originators of the domestic va-
riety though i rarely saw them on the
wing could be heard crowing and scut-
tling in the brakes all round my camp

  there were no duck or teal or snipe in
the vicinity as these flourished in the
flatter more marshy districts farther to
the south i was soon to come across
them however for when the next mon-
soon season was shrouding the jungle
in rain i received instructions to pro-
ceed to the firms rafting station at
sawankaloke
by reginald
campbell

rfts are used because obviously you
cannot allow thousands of logs to
come drifting out of the jungle rivers
and then down the great parent river
mae nam into the populated water-way
of bangkok somewhere the logs have
got to be caught and collected into rafts
which manned by river experts can be
brought down under control to the capi-
tal but rafts cannot negotiate water-
falls and the companies therefore built
their stations immediately below the
southernmost falls of the main rivers

  a very big rise had occurred i learned
from richmond the man i had come
to relieve a fortnight before bringing
thousands of logs down from the tribu-
taries of the north these logs had been
caught and brought into the banks by
the villagers for the usual salvage money

fiaid them by the firms and now the
icensed raftsmen-swarthy siamese for
we were now south of lao territory-
were engaged in making the timber up
into rafts containing an average of one
hundred and sixty logs apiece our job
richmond told me was to supervise the
work in general settle disputes between
rival raftsmen advance them money
take all raft-meajurements when the
rafts were completed and then send
them off on the first stage of their long
journey down to bangkok

  after a period in sawankaloke rich-
mond and i moved forty-five miles down-
stream to a place called sukothai where
the companys second rafting station was
situated

  of all the desolate jpiserable god-
forsaken places on this earth sukothai
must surely be the worst the country
all round was just one vast flat desolate
swamp of mud cane and elephant-grass
and the heat was appalling the only
other white men in sukothai-or indeed
anywhere for a hundred miles in any
given direction-were two danes and an
englishman all rafting assistants for
their respective firms like myself the
work at sukothai was very hard but it
was all the more welcome in that it
helped one to fo-get about sukothai

fleas are good for a dog they keep a
dog from brooding on being a dog
when the last of the rafts had left
sukothai i thankfully departed from the
place in order to see the timber through
the royalty stations at paknampoh the
rains were long over and the brief cold
weather had set in by the time the last
raft got safely through to bangkok i
then left paknampoh and spent the hot
weather doing some river trips counting
the logs left stranded on the sand-bars
and when finally i returned to northern
hq in nakon i found my boss orwell
in from his muang ngow forest it was
then i heard the tale of the running amok
of our elephant poo kam sen

now the asiatic elephant differs much
from his african brother he has
shorter thicker legs his ears are much
smaller his body is more massive and he
has a great square head in place of the
africans sloping one the biggest afri-
can elephant stands about twelve feet at
the shoulder the biggest asiatic ten  ten
feet is exceptional however eight being
quite a good height for a tusker the
biggest animal i ever saw-poo kam sen
-stood nine feet three inches

  in the siamese teak forests baby ele-
phants are allowed to run free beside
their mothers till they reach the age of
five as soon as one is born-and it must
be remembered that teak-forest elephants
live almost completely natural lives in
their natural surroundings dragging logs
for only a few hours a day and then graz-
ing in the jungle-a cow elephant from
one of the near-by workers attaches itself
of its own accord to the mother and be-
comes the babys aunt thereafter
nothing short of force will separate the
two cows until the little one is at least
three years old the idea is i suppose
that with two great forms to guard it on
either side the babe will be well prp-



real experiences

tected from the attacks of tiger and the
custom which is presumably the result
of instinct is a remarkable one known
only as far as i am aware to teak-wal-
lahs a baby elephant incidentally
sucks the milk of its mother with mouth
not trunk

  when the youngster is five it is sepa-
rated by force from its mother and
aunt if still there and tied to four
stakes in the ground against these it
strives uselessly till it learns that man is
its master every attention and kindness
is then shown it and a mahout is detailed
to give it a few simple lessons in being
ridden to these it usually readily re-
sponds

  from the ages of five to fifteen ele-
phants mainly do baggage work the how-
dahs and weights in them getting bigger
along with the growth of the animal at
fifteen he or she is practically grown-up
and can be put to timber-work

  the tales that are told of elephants
living two or three hundred years are
nonsense seventy or eighty is a good
age as with humans though cases no
doubt exist of a hundred being reached
while wild elephants may sometimes at-
tain a hundred and twenty years

where do elephants go to when they
die  many are the stories that have
been woven round this mystery as mys-
tery to my mind it still is wild elephants
are numerous in the north of siam yet
never once did i meet a forest hunter or
any other man who had ever come across
the remains of one which considering
the size of the skeleton not to mention
the tusks that never turn to bone-dust
is surprising personally i do not beieve
any burial-ground does exist but further
than that i cannot go preferring to treat
the whole question as unanswerable

  amongst our own force of course
deaths were fairly frequent and after
cutting out the tusks we made a practice
of burning the bodies with kerosene and
firewood diseases such as anthrax
and surra accounted for a good many and
occasionally we lost an animal through
the bulls fighting one another as the
supply of calves was not sufficient to re-
place this constant drainage we bought
as and when required from burmese and
shan elephant traders these in turn
obtained their supply under government
license by capturing wild elephants and
breaking them in the method of cap-
ture has been too often described by other
writers for me to go into here but briefly

it is done by rounding up a herd and driv-
ing it into a stockade after which the
chosen animals are noosed by tame ones
and tied to trees outside the enclosure
they are then put through the ordeal of
the posts which ordeal remarkably
enough they often take better when fully
grown than when they are youngsters
after that it is a matter of training them
at the routine baggage and timber work
until they are proficient enough to offer
for sale 

  the male has periods of disturbance
known as musth during which he is
highly dangerous and has to remain se-
curely shackled to a tree one can tell
when an attack is coming on by an oily
discharge that starts exuding from a hole
in the temple when the oil which comes
out very gradually has trickled down to
a level with the eye-then look out if
hes not properly secured the chances
are hell try to kill anyone in sight

  an elephant cannot take all four feet
off the ground at once in other words
it cannot jump and a ditch which a horse
or even a big dog cojld cross will there-
fore stop it completely it cannot turn
its head round like the average animal
because its neck is too short so if it wants
to see what is going on behind it has to
turn its whole body round this makes it
very nervous at being suddenly ap-
proached from the rear

  it has an instinctive distrust of dogs
and horses though buffaloes and bullocks
it doesnt mind in the least with the
exception of the whale it is probably the
finest swimmer of all the mammalia it
is a shade-loving creature and cannot
stand being exposed to hot sun it loves
getting frightened and starting panics
especially if a female it has such a thin
skin that it suffers torments from the
bites of insects for this reason it flings
with the aid of its trunk dust and mud
over itself whenever possible its sight
is not very good but its powers of scent
are enormous it can wind a man or a
tiger up to a distance of over two miles
it sleeps only for about three hours out
of the twenty-four

in character elephants vary just as much
as dogs or human beings for that
matter for example i recall poo noi
pee bah literally the small mad one a
fine big tusker for weeks on end he
would be a model working well and be-
having well and then for no reason con-
nected with musth or anything else he
would suddenly become a fierce morose
teak-wallah



brute up to any sort of mischief he
would attack other elephants chase
coolies one night he even attacked the
forest manager in his tent and the man-
ager was lucky to escape alive

  then there was mae toom who al-
ways looked in the pink of condition yet
was constantly developing some irri-
tating little minor ailment and there
vere those who pai-ed into chums these
chums were particularly exasperating
two-they might be tuskers or they
might be cows-would each suddenly de-
cide that in the other he had met his
soul-mate and thereafter as in the
aunt racket nothing short of force
would separate them perhaps one would
be a skilled river-worker and the other
a hill-worker necessitating completely
different camps being chosen for them
and then the trurnpetings the bellow-
ings the general rumpus when the sepa-
ration came the midnight journeys
too as they strove to meet again and
the oaths of the mahouts who had to fol-
low them up next day still one
couldnt help sympathizing with them

  then there were the killers that were
always killers generally huge sullen
tuskers which though they had been
fcroken in at the posts had never really
been tamed and still retained the souls
of tigers there was the female who
would only have the hobbles placed on
her hind-legs instead of on the fore and
the traveler who insisted on being put
in the rear while on the march and the
tusker who loved digging up human
corpses and eating them-a disgusting
habit but only too painfully true

to return to orwell and poo kam
sen this elephant went on musth
and unfortunately broke the chain by
which he had been secured to a tree
and got free thus it happened that one
morning while traveling on their lawful
occasions along a strip of the nakon
muang ngow road two o our elephants
together with their mahouts beheld the
mightiest tusker in the land advancing
upon them hell in his mien and eye
even they the elephants feared him
and turning they led sidewise into the
jungle shedding howdahs and mahouts
in the process luckily for them not to
speak of the men poo kam sen con-
tinued up the road instead of branching
aside  but a lao husbandman walking
alone on the road was knocked down
crushed and left a shapeless mass of
flesh and blood in the dust

  on then now mad with musth and
blood went poo kam sen except for
the very slight chink and slur of the
chain he made not a sound that is the
terrible thing about him and his kind
he may be a foot or two behind you yet
you wont know hes there so noiselessly
does he move two bullock-carts ap-
peared ahead the drivers just had time
to flee and he was on them smashing the
carts to matchwood and killing the pa-
tient bullocks

quickly the news spread poo kam
sen was loose and had turned killer
amok	amok orwell out on

a round trip of inspection foamed into
his compound by the village on his gray
mare poo kam sen was not orwells ele-
phant but the chief who owned the ani-
mal was ten days journey away and he
orwell must be responsible for the safe-
ty of the village and its inhabitants

  tell everyone to keep to their houses
he snapped to the village headman he
next beckoned to his own elephant head-
man  the tuskers of the company were
also in danger for should any of them be
seen by poo kam sen the chances are
they would be attacked

  have every poo that is near the vil-
lage sent a good ten miles away he or-
dered next he pointed to a strip of har-
vested paddyland opposite the company
compound on the other side of the river

  dig a pit he told them there in
the center of that field let it be eight
feet deep and six feet wide and let every
man available get on with the work
when the pit is finished conceal it with
a covering of leaves and bamboo then
place a plank across the middle so that
a man may get over in safety and an
elephant may not

  so murmured the brown audience
puzzled but vastly interested

  when everything is ready orwell
continued the mahouts shall drive two
cow elephants into the field in the hopes
of luring poo kam sen after them
but the pit objected the village
headman of what use is it master
for it will only be by the merest chance
that poo kam sen will go near enough to
fall into it

  it will not be by the merest chance
returned orwell because a man will
go into the middle of the field and the
elephant seeing him will charge the
man will then make for the pit and run
across the plank leaving poo kam sen
to fall in surely it is clear


real experiences

  meh  exclamations of awe rose from
a dozen dusky throats and who-who
will be the man master

  i will be said orwell

  thus it came about that the pit was
dug the females driven into position
and poo kam sen lured out after them
into the middle of the field behind the
pit armed with bamboo spears and ropes
stood numerous mahouts and coolies
and with them was orwell

  im going said he after a final
glance round at the preparations then
he walked halfway down one side of the
field after which he swung boldly out
into the open

  poo kam sen dallying with his cows
saw him let out one great bellow of
wrath surged his whole colossal bulk for-
ward to blot out this impudent pygmy
orwell turning fled for his life toward
the pit

  poo kam sen gained on him-though
he dared not turn round he was sure of
it ah there was the concealed pit-
at last and there the plank leading to
safety one two three four-and he
was over

crash with a thud that literally
shook the earth the vast body
smashed down into the pit

  quick the ropes panted orwell

  the coolies and mahouts leaped for-
ward but the awesome spectacle of the
enraged leviathan bellowing and trum-
peting smashing and heaving and goring
at the sides of his precarious prison
caused their hands to tremble and the
ropes to get confused

  out hes getting out i suddenly
shrieked one of the men

  a pause in which to their horror
they saw that poo kam sen thanks to
his stupendous might had actually man-
aged to tear down part of one side of the
pit and was beginning to heave himself
up over the falling earth the coolies
and mahouts waited for no more drop-
ping their ropes they fled across the mae
ngow river and orwell finding him-
self alone and helpless had no course left
but to follow them

  that evening news came that the ele-
phant had killed another man

  there followed for the village indeed
for the whole district nights and days of
fear a fear augmented one particular
night by thieves dragging a chain
through a darkened alleyway thereby
inducing the populace to believe that the

killer was in their midst and causing
them to make a mad dash from the
marketplace once the stalls were clear
of occupants the theves helped them-
selves to whatever they wanted

  owing to the menace of the killer the
work of the whole muang ngow teak
forest came to a standstill at last there
came to orwell the companys elephant-
medicine-maker bear ng a bundle of ar-
rows the tips of which were stained with
a greenish flufd and a buffalo horn
filled with powder

  lord said he i have an idea these
are poisoned arrows and if they are put
in guns and fired at poo kam sens legs
then will he become so lame that he will
scarcely be able to mcve at all at which
your servants the coolies and mahouts
will surely have the chance to rope him

  orwell jumped at the suggestion he
had his own gun and the somewhat
primitive firearms belonging to the vil-
lage headman and one or two others
loaded with the arrows then the party
went off stalking poc kam sen they
came across him half in and half out of
the jungle on the river-bank below the
ford and though orwdl tried to restrain
his followers till they were at closer
quarters the sight of the great beast was
too much for them off went the guns
nearly killing orwell n the process and
causing poo kam sen to bolt without a
scratch

  after that orwell decided to hunt
alone what happened during the next
few days only he knows but he was suc-
cessful in getting several arrows home
and it wasnt long be ore poo kam sen
was reduced to impotency

it was a ghastly sight though in the
 end said orwell as he concluded
his story the great brute was rolling
and staggering like a drunken man what
with the pain of the poison and the
musth going out of him    will he
get over it he was al nost himself again
by the time i left to come in here

  thus ended the running amok of poo
kam sen and if ever a man showed
courage and resource in a trying time
with no one to help him and a great
responsibility upon his shoulders it was
orwell

  it is with the deejjest regret that i
have just heard wiile writing these
pages of his death in his native glou-
cestershire there was valor and no
meanness in him

further adventures of our teak-wallah will be described in an early issue
iussian hunt

     instead cf chasing the wolves
     they let the wolves chase them

 by bcrnis pavloff

during my last year in the cadet
school at orenburg in russia
instead of spending the entire
christmas vacation at home i decided to
pay a visit to the heme of my school chum
basil svietloff it was a trip of over a
hundred miles old jacob accompanied
me and we traveled by sleigh the
horses harnessed in troika or three
abreast as we started on our journey
snow was falling heavily and soon our
progress became slow through the deep
drifts nightfall brought us to a village
buried in snow acob jumped out and
patted arabs head gratefully the snow
in front of one of the mounds on the left
moved as the door behind it pushed open

a sturdy hulk of a man appeared in the
doorway jacob recognized him as the
chief man of the village he cordially
invited us in to get warm it turned out
that our host was a veteran soldier and
when he learned that i was in the cadet
school he told of the campaigns in which
he had participated later a bed was
fixed up in the guest corner for me and
jacob and the head-man lay down to
sleep over the stove

   by morning the storm had sufficiently
abated to permit us to continue our jour-
ney to the svietloffs where we arrived
about dark the three brothers came
out to greet us

   hello friend travelers shouted bas-
 il who was the youngest what a storm 
 hope you arent frostbitten come in
 and get thawed 

  we assured him we were not frost-
bitten then basil had another idea
do you feel like going out again to-
night he asked brother thought it
would be a good night for a wolf-hunt
there are plenty of wolves roaming
about added alexander they are
very daring and fierce this winter a
few nights ago a couple of the beasts
came right up to the porch by the garden
basil hurried to fetch a gun but before
he returned with it they were gone

  the prospect of a wolf-hunt was ex-
hilarating the love of adventure and
the hunters instinct in me were strong
so it was quickly agreed that we should
go on a hunt that very night-but not
before we had partaken heavily of de-
licious meat pie and other things

  by about eight-thirty it had accom-
modatingly stopped snowing the air
was crisp and the white-carpeted ground
sparkled in the moonlight every dark
object stood out plainly against the
white background the night was ideal
for a hunt the rosvalni-a low light
seatless sleigh open at the back-was
brought up it also had poles stuck out
from each side to prevent it from over-
turning on curves blankets were piled
on straw on its floor on which we could
sit the stableman inspected the entire
equipment carefully each of us stuck
a revolver in his belt for emergency use
a young pig and another sack with pig-
dung in it together with a long rope
were brought from the stables and placed
in charge of feodor alexander took the
reins with our guns beside us after the
usual paternal benediction we were off
on the nights adventure with a greater
knowledge of the perils of wolf-hunting
basils father dispatched a couple of men
on horseback to follow our trail and be
on hand if needed

galloping over crusted snow the
horses brought us to the edge of the
forest as we drove among the shadows
made by the trees and bushes we set to
work on the final preparations for the
sport the sack was tied to the long rope
and thrown out to trail along some sixty
yards behind the squeals of the un-
happy little pig in the other sack in the
sleigh were the only sounds which dis-
turbed the nights stillness eagerly we
watched the shadows for lurking wolves

  the first wolf we see is yours boris
be ready with your gun alexander re-
minded me


russian hunt

  he had scarcely uttered these words
when i espied a pair of green eyes gleam-
ing from the shadows on the left side of
th road

  wait till he attacks the sack cau-
tioned alexander in my ear

  suddenly two huge wolves pounced on
the trailing sack i brought my gun to
bear on them and fired twice one of
the beasts jumped high into the air and
rolled over when he landed the other
clung tenaciously to the sack with his
wicked teeth the horses snorted and
pranced about with instinctive dread
again i shot at the second beast and he
too rolled over excited and gloating
over the kill basil and i jumped out of
the sleigh to get the quarry but alex-
ander again admonished us

  better go slow and be careful be
sure they are dead before you get too
close if only wounded they will be
nasty

  cautiously we approached the beasts
and when close enough to examine them
found them to be killed and dragged
them into the sleigh and then we re-
sumed the hunt

twice again we saw glittering green
eyes in the shadows but the beasts
slunk off the little pig had become
mute and had to be prodded into noisy
activity to remind it of the part it must
play in the nights adventure for a
long time no wolf showed itself and
we were growing impatient then at the
edge of the forest appeared a large dark
moving mass

  the horses snorted and kicked at
the shafts frantically it was a pack of
wolves and they kept coming steadily
nearer to us they were more numerous
than we had expected to meet when
they were within close range we shot
at them with gun and pistol repeatedly
one of the beasts jumped at a horses
head but a well-directed shot laid him
low the snarling pack surrounded us
we were in a real fix but we kept up the
fire and eventually killed or cowed them
when five of them lay dead the rest ran
off much to our relief there had been
nine of them we congratulated ourselves
on getting out of the mess so luckily

  content with the nights sport we
turned back home where we found mr
svietloff still up and waiting anxiously
for us he understood better than we
young-bloods that hunting wolves was
very serious business and was relieved
when we were safely home

i was repairing a sixty-ton axle-press
in the heat-treating department of one
of detroits largest car factories with a
fellow called john supervising the work
john was one of those men who was al-
ways too eager to please the men higher
up and before the main bearing caps had
been replaced on the punch press he told
the superintendent lhat the job was
complete and took me over to work on
an electric carbonizing furnace at the
other side of the building

  two of the center rails in the bottom
of the furnace bed had become warped
by the months of constant heat but hav-
ing been shut off two days previously it
was quite cool now and crawling
through the fourteen-inch opening i be-t
gan replacing the old members with new
ones while john fed me the material to
do it with

  it was a dusty cramped-up place to
work in i was hurrying and had but a
few minuteswork left to do when i heard
the superintendent bawling out john
about the punch-press flying to pieces

  i had to grin to myself but i was
far from grinning a lew moments later
as i had just drawn the last bolt snug
and was about to pull myself through
the tight-fitting opening to get outside
when the electrically operated doors
jammed shut and locked me inside

  now i realized that i was in one deuce
of a fix and many crazy thoughts ran
through my mind i thanked my stars
that it wasnt a blast furnace that i was
in as in that case i would have been
roasted alive practically the instant that
the gas was lighted still i could pic-
ture myself dying an awful death in that
infernal hole a short time after the opera-
tor turned on the electricity

  i hadnt the least doubt but that john
had given the report that the job was
completed before it was and that in his
frenzy over being bawled out by the
superintendent he had entirely forgotten
that i was still in the furnace

  but rattled and fearful as i felt i had
jocked in a cjfiurnace

ivhat happened when they really turned on the heat

by ivan j stretten

 sense left to real ze that i was at the
 wrong end of the furnace ever to hope
 to get those outside to hear my calls or
 pleadings so i began to work my way
 toward the other or feeder end of the
 furnace some fifty feet away i had to
 crawl on my stomach and i barely
 reached my destination when the elec-
 tricity was turned on

   the closest electrical element was
 about six feet away but in a very short
 time the place became extremely uncom-
 fortable and the big beads of perspira-
 tion fairly rolled down my face and
 body

   i began to yell and pound on the cast-
 iron door and the more i continued to
 do so without an answer from the out-
 - side the further my spirits seemed to
 drop then i realized that because of
 the constant rumblings associated with
 such a departmert it was next to im-
 possible to make myself heard any dis-
 tance away fron the outside of the
 furnace but i still held hopes that some
 one passing close by would eventually
 hear the noise which i was frantically
 endeavoring to create

   every second it became more hot and
 suffocating and my clothes began to
 scorch with the heat but by taking off
 my smock and hanging it over the near-
 est conduit-cover i managed to keep
 my face from burning

   this little act proved very helpful
 for a few minutes but the smock started
 to smolder and i was jprced to take it
 down the smoke from the smock and
 the increasing heat caused me to cough
 and gasp for brea h a person has to ex-
 perience such a thing to realize the many
 weird thoughts that ran through my
 mind as i visioned being roasted to
 death with hundreds of other people
 only a few feet away not knowing of my
 desperate predicament

   it takes several hours to bring the
 temperature of an electric carbonizing
 furnace to a red heat and at least a
 couple of hours before it becomes hot

 enough to roast a person but after
 twenty minutes i was on the verge of
 calling quits when the door opened an
 inch or so

  i knew that the act of lifting the door
a fraction was for the purpose of letting
out any gas which might be present in
the corners of the furnace and the in-
stant that i saw the door move i yelled
with all my might but the operator
failed to hear me

  i must admit that i was actually fran-
tic now and had practically given up
all hopes of ever being saved when i
suddenly thought of shoving my hammer
handle through the small crack at the
bottom of the door i couldnt hope to
raise the half-ton casting but i didnt
want it to go shut again as the little
fresh air that i could get through the
opening felt intensely refreshing to my
parched throat and lungs and i imagined
that by wiggling the hammer-handle i
might happen to draw attention

my feet began to feel like red-hot
coals and i could distinctly smell
the grease on my overalls scorching from
the heat but the little fresh air that i
managed to get from under the door
seemed to make it less suffocating than
it had been a few minutes before

  numerous accidents and narrow es-
capes from death on the motorcycle
race tracks and in many other hazard-
ous undertakings had hardened me con-
siderably to pain and worry but this was
one instance when i gave up in fact i
had lost all hope entirely when the door
suddenly flew open and john appeared
in the opening

  good lord   he frantically exclaimed
as he dragged me out

  i had promised myself to say many
rough things to john if he ever got back
in time to save me but i couldnt help
feeling as sorry for him as myself when
i saw his scared condition and to this
day john and i are the only ones who
actually know what happened


there was famine in southern
rhodesia in  the matabele
were in rebellion the country burned
off all oxen from the zambezi to the cape
killed by the fell disease of rinderpest
south africa had inherited the seven
plagues of egypt and corpses of starved
natives strewed the land

  i was running a wattle-and-daub trad-
ing store at mangwe matabeleland six
hundred miles from the nearest railroad
and then was agent for the old ten-mule
leather-swung coaches besides those
only the transport riders who rode up
provisions the few dutch farmers and
the british south african police in the
tiny fort constituted my customers
occasionally an afghan ali khan
passed with a drove of horses from the
back of the kalahari desert sometimes
a hindu came along with a herd of
sheep brought out of the kalahari grass

  food being so scarce i always had
thirty or forty uninvited boys working
about the store and kraal for what i
could give them to eat they however
were only a continual nuisance i never
knew which were my unpaid assistants
and which werent boys came and
stole and went

  the hindu was in the store one day
and against the law he was drinking
scotch whisky dressed in regular white
indian costume with red sash and tur-
ban he yet was drinking his whisky
straight

  seyyid i remarked after hed pol-
ished off a whole bottle when you die
youll die pre-cremated

  no baas he corrected when i
die i die still thirsty and standin up
the hindu presently turned and
looked out over the parched sand and to
his herd of distressed panting sheep my
ees followed his switched about opened
wide coming out of the round mud-

j-feld for

a young trader in rhodesia
gets himself into a serio-
comic jam

and-thatch hut i called my dining-room
i saw a native in cne hand the native
had a jar of my most sacred preserves
in the other a can ol beef

  like a flash i came to with a howl i
was over the rough enpty-beer-case-built
counter and to the door the native
heard me coming took one squint at me
then was off swift as a springbok

  the hindu was outside quick as i but
with me there was a rifle for some
reason instead of bolting acros the veldt
the native headed straight for the fort

 for two hundred yards the boy
sprinted downhill to the dry reedy bed of
the mangwe river then leaped to climb
the zigzagging path up a couple of hun-
dred feet of rocky rise angry yet
laughing i turned to seyyid i was only
a kid of about twenty

  poor hungry devil i said i dont
blame him seyyid but you watch me
make him hop over those rocks

  the hindu glowered shoot baas
shoot the blixom  he only dog 

  no ill not shoot him i grinned
but ill make him move

  twenty or thirty feet either side of the
native i planted bullets and watched the
sand spurt up sent them over his head
and heard them ricochet and go whe-e-e 
over the brow of the rise in but a mo-
ment the fellow was out of sight

  early in the afternoon i saw coming
down that same rocky slope two police

  the police came iri and had a drink
one of em a swede addressed me you
bane under rrest he said

  i didnt take any notice and produced
the dice-box for an hour or so we
threw for drinks then suddenly as if re-
membering something the swede re-
peated  you bane under rrest

  what in blazes dyou mean i asked
him at last whats the joke

  the other policeman supplied the in-
formation youre vnder arrest bertie
weve come over to fetch you this
morning you shot at and tried to kill a
kaffir inkomozaan he calls himself


by ferdinand
berthoud

  kill a kaffir  i bawled all i did
was to shoot all around him to make him
run faster he stole stuff off me ask
seyyid here he saw it all

  the swede gurgled you bane under
rrest

  it was dusk when i shut up the store
by maneuvering i managed to get each
policeman still enough to sling his rifle
strap over his shculder and chest then
in the middle and holding each up by an
arm i started for the fort and doom
gripping a bottle seyyid watched me go

at the fort there was little formality

 armstrong he commissioner just
looked at me sadly and told me what a
serious crime id committed

  crime i exploded has that boy
got the nerve to come and tell you i was
trying to kill him when all i was doing
was trying to sca-e him when hed been
stealing off me

  theres the law armstrong argued
you could have lodged a complaint
against this inkomozaan and have had
him punished

  i went purple how am i going to
know that a running boy three or four
hundred yards away from me is named
inkomozaan am i a seer i didnt
shoot at him i played with him
you shouldnt have used firearms
armstrong abjured im afraid bertie
youll have to appear before me tomor-
row morning on the charge of attempted
murder if you have any witnesses you
must bring em and yffull have to put
up seventy-five pounds bail otherwise
ill have you kept in the fort all night
bail i howled what are you
trying to make of me a criminal  ive
only got about twenty pounds with me
armstrong in any case

  s-s-s-sh  arm strong soothed dont
et upset ill lend you the odd fifty-
ve bertie you be here at ten to-
morrow

  i took armstrongs fifty-five fished
out my own twenty and put em along

handed back the seventy-five all right
armstrong i agreed ill be here
soll half the country

  and that was that

  every dutch farmer dutch vroouw
dutch tante trader prospector trans-
port-rider and policeman living within a
score of miles was there when i rode over
next morning-fully a hundred people
the kaffir telegraph had spread the
news quickly

  armstrongs mud hut wasnt any big-
ger than any of mine in the fort there
wasnt any hut big enough for a court-
house foresighted armstrong had set
kaffirs to bring in trunks of trees and
arrange them in a semicircle out in the
open for those interested to sit on and
that was the court

  almost all that day we sat in the blaz-
ing sun and the business of the court
didnt progress at all right at the
jump id explained to armstrong that
seyyid my only witness was missing
when id got home the night before and
hadnt put in an appearance since

  thats unfortunate armstrong al-
lowed well just have to wait till he
can be found ill send a dozen or so
native police out and maybe theyll
round him up

  i	was thinking about my closed store
and the thirty or forty strange kaffirs
lurking about it i hope to god they
do i told him

  along about three-thirty hans lees
wife and crissie van rooyen stretched
out flat on the sand by armstrongs chair
and went to sleep one by one the
native police came in shaking their
heads seyyids sheep still were strag-
gling about they said but there was no
sign of any hindu

  blinking of a sudden armstrong came
to life and got to his feet courts ad-
journed till tomorrow he announced

next day at ten oclock the crowd
was bigger and willie g- from a
store fifteen miles up in the pass in the


real experiences

matoppo hills had of his own volition
shut up and come down by coach to be
my lawyer but still no hindu

  armstrong rose stiffly sorry  i have
to do my duty i have to send a report
in we must adjourn for the day and
be here again tomorrow bertie i warn
you if you dont produce thio witness of
yours tomorrow ill have to send you
and the case as it is to the court in
bulawayo and let them deal with it
we cant wait forever

  willie was very drunk when we went
to bed that night but his head was work-
ing berie he said court aint bein
run right you wait morrow mornin
berie an see what happens

  several sixteen-mule tented wagons
had pulled in that third morning and the
court seats were dotted with a score or
so of barefoot dutch children fires
were going in all directions and big-
breasted kaffir umfazis were preparing
food

  willie didnt sit down at all arm-
strong he opened out as soon as the
commissioner hove in sight what sort of
hoojah are you trying to pull off here
you dont know one thing about court
procedure youve been keeping every-
body waiting the past two days for the
prisoners one witness without once mak-
ing any formal charge or calling any
witness for the prosecution

  armstrong visibly wilted well i was
only trying to be decent wasnt i i
wanted to give bertie a chance

  chance me foot willie jeered go
on with the case

  armstrong shuffled very well he
agreed here goes

  in their own tongue armstrong called
to his beautifully muscled brown-black
native police to rise from their haunches
and stand behind him then seated him-
self in his chair waving to the much
occupied and totally inattentive crowd
around he did his best

  ladies and gentlemen he opened
out four days ago the prisoner bertie
shot at a native one inkomozaan with
intent to kill the charge against him
is attempted murder the first witness
for the prosecution will be the aggrieved
native inkomozaan   

  inkomozaan rose his voice in mata-
bele come here and stand at my side
and before me where i can see you and
hear your tale

  yuh willie helped him hear his
tale

  for a full minute the scattered crowd

took notice and waited no native made
any attempt o break from the mob a
tremor went through the muddle of
whites among the natives appeared
strange consternation--a mumbling and
muttering as of puzzled dismay pres-
ently one more bold native policeman
edged round to armstrong

  inkomozaan the bass says he wants
he inquired

  yes inkomozaan

  the kaffir hunched his shoulders and
opened his arms wide as to embrace the
earth oh inkomozaan inkomozaan
was frightened baas the big crowd
frightened him two days ago he ran
away

 ran away whereto

  the kaffir hunched again into the
hills baas into the bush hes gone
lost

  as a man stricken armstrong gripped
the edges of his chair for an instant
his face was blank and he didnt speak
suddenly he sprang to his feet dug a
hand into a pocket and brought out a
wad of bills still silent he counted off
twenty pounds

   here bertie he said at length
its all over heres your bail-money
the complainants vanished the case is 
dismissed

 yuh willie came in again i
knew youd be glad to give him his
money back and get rid of him now
he and ill go over to the store and
spend the twenty

side by side up the slope toward the
store willie and  rode standing
bang in front of the dcor of the store we
both noted a white-clad red-turbaned
figure well i knew who it was the
figure ran to meet us

  my baas my baas seyyid fair-
ly sang as he ran my baas is safe
and is back again

  mad as a hatter i slid to the ground
caught the hindu by his white kimono
and roughly shook hira what in hell
have you been playing at i raved
three days now ive been standing a
chance of going to jail or getting hanged
and you could have got me out of it in
two minutes whats the idea

  seyyids dusky face became almost
beatific he waved a bottle of whisky
i save the baas ie cried i save
him

  three nights and two days i kneel
in the reeds in the river-bed baas and
pray that the baas get off
