how silent simms became a
master of speech

 by martin m byron

ou arc exasperating bcyourl words shot
j out mr worden  why didnt you keep
mr truesdalc here you knew i would
be back in ten minutes

  harry simms gulped hard and replied w cly
i did try to keep him here mr worden but he
wouldnt stay

 what wouldnt stay even ten minutes why
you could have kept him i hat ions without his
realizing it why didnt you talk to him about
the weather about peace about i he price of potatoes
about anythingi

  this wasnt the first calling down  had heard
simms get he had been with i he firm for eight
years and had reached the point where lie was as
much a fixture around i he offiec as i he desk or i he
chairs he was so quiet that the only things that
would start him talking were such momentous events
as the beginning of the war or the end of the war
even when his baby was born harry said only
three wortls- its a boy

  it wasnt long before we nicknamed him  silent
simms

  yet the silent simms of two years ago is now
our salesmanager regarded as one of the most
brilliant men in our organization getting an annual
salary that runs dose to five figures and is slated for
the vice-presidency

  how all this happened in so short a time makes one
of the most remarkable stories of success i have ever
heard but lot harry tell the story as hn told it to me
when i asked him point-blank wliat sort of magic lie
used in transforming himself

   well said harry  you remember when mr
truesdale came in that day and  could not hold him
for ten minutes until the chief got back and when
the chief came back and found truesdalc gone how
he bawled me out that incident marked the tiirnino
point of my life

  it was the most humiliating experience  ever went
through r had been with the firm  years-was getting
 a week-and was the office  football  went home
that night determined to learn how to talk convincingly
interestingly and forcibly so that i coukl hold people
spell bound not only for  minutes but by the hour

i did not want to become a public speaker-what 
wanted was the ability to talk as a business asset 
bought numberless books on public speaking but they all
taught oratory and were so complicated that i gave up
almost in discouragement i continued my search how-
ever and was rewarded a few weeks later by hearing
about the work of dr frederick ilouk law who was
conducting a course in business talking and public
speaking

   you may be sure that i lost no time in attending the
lectures i went after them as eagerly as a hungry wolf
goes after food to my great surprise and pleasure 
grasped the secret of being a convincing talker-the secret
 had needed  my life-almost in the first lesson

   almost at once  learned why i was afraid to stand
up and talk to others i learned lion to talk to a number
of people at the saicc lime i learned how to make people
listen to every word  said  learned how to say things
interestingly forcibly ami convincingly r learned how to
listen while others talked i learned how to say exactly
what i meant

   and the whole thing was so simple that in a single
evening i learned the secrets that turned me into a very
dynamo of ambition  knew that i had at last found
the road to mastery of speech  began to apply the
principles at once and found that my words were electri-
fying people i began to get things done it wasnt long
before i was taken off my old desk and put at the city
salesmans desk you know how i made good seems
almost like a dream now then a short time later  was
given rogers job on the road in the hardest territory we
have and when i began to break records there the chief
wired me to come back and gave me morgans job as the
sales manager when morgan was put in charge of the
seattle office

   this great change came over me simply as a result of
my having learned how to talk i imagine there are
thousands of others who arc in the same boat in which
i found myself and who could become big money-makers
if they only learned the secret of being a convincing
talker

  when harry simms finished  asked him if t could not
have the benefit of hr laws course and lie told me that
only recently  r law had prepared a complete course in
printed form which contained exactly the same instruc-
tions as lie had given in bis lectures i sent for it and
found it to be exactly as he stated after studying the
eight simple lessons  began to realize that simms suc-
cess was the natural outcome of real ability to talk for
my own success with the course has been as great as his
 can never tllank simms enough for telling me about  r
laws course in business talking and public speaking

 b s mcmullen was a freight checker on the
 docks at seattle

two years after beginning the lasallo
course in interstate commerce and traffic
management he was appointed general
freight and passenger agent

he said that it would probably have taken
him  or  years to make this advance if he had
depended merely upon work and experience

 lasalle experts helped him to reach the top
 in the space of months

the slings and arrows

he had noted it before had henry
baird he noted it again now
ones first impression of that attrac-
tive alan moss smile was quite all wrong
the second impression was the true one
casting faint and ominous light upon the
murkier depths of the moss soul

  even this time though the smile had
fooled henry for a moment flashed at
him over the side of the long pale-blue sport
car as he himself stood on the curb its
white teeth its twinkling eyes had carried
their brief illusion of friendliness and can-
dor until henry catching himself had
looked more closely of course-until henry
had noted again that the teeth were hard
and sharp as well as white teeth made for
biting rather than for smiling and that the
seeming twinkle was in reality a keen sly
glint betraying an inner wealth of pure
unscrupulous malice these things may not
have been apparent to most people but cer-
tain deep secret personal stirrings had
given henry baird the vision

  still there was no denying that alan was
good enough to look upon in his limp un-

    	a-s

dersized way his skin was clean and tight
his features regular his clothes as perfect
as the car he drove and as expensive as the
huge portmanteau strapped so trimly at its
side his voice matched the rest of him
being crisp and clear to the point of sharp-
ness as he said

   youre not staying in town all summer
baird

   i may get out for a while next month
henry muttered

   not before that eh

   no

  mr moss nodded and surveyed upper
broadway its rolling cars its tall apart-
ment-houses its afternoon sunshine

   manage to keep yourself pretty well
occupied eh	t

   so-so said henry with the tight-
lipped evasive smile of the man who has
much in the business line that he does not
care to discuss

  he started a trifle however as mr moss
having considered the gloved hand that
rested on his steering-wheel addressed it
directly

   youve given up the idea of working
that michigan copper property of yours
baird


all-story weekly

   i never had any idea of working it
myself

   thats true too you told me that
youd sold it recently didnt you

   im considering an offer for it although
i dont recall telling you anything about it
henry said quite pointedly

  mosss disarming grin turned on him sud-
denly almost wonderinglv and then broad-
ened with the utmost good cheer

   quite so-i get you i beg your par-
don baird its no business of mine of
course i like to congratulate a man who
has cleaned up a million or so-thats really
all

   well i havent cleaned up any million
-yet said henry with a strange signifi-
cant smile

  altogether on his guard now he waited
for further impertinent queries they were
not propounded by mr moss mr moss
indeed seemed to have lost interest in
henry for the moment his gaze directed
at the lower skies grew absent almost
rapt his lips pursed for a little parted in
a faint soft smile he sighed audibly

   youre headed out of town henry
ventured and there was the oddest little
sharp note of anxiety in the inquiry

   eh me alan returned to earth and
stared at him for a moment  oh yes
im running away for a while theres
nothing to keep me in new york and its
very pleasant up-er-in the woods

   what woods henry said bluntly

   im going up massachusetts way moss
submitted mildly

   ah youve got a place of your own
in-where was it rockridge henry
asked the railing of the subway ventilator

  alan moss crossed his legs and fastened
a baby gaze on henry

   no i havent a place there he said
blandly  as a matter of fact im going
up that way though i stop at the hotel or
-just visit around a bit a good many of
the people you and i know are in the rock-
ridge colony at this time of the year

i know they are mused henry

   the burgesses alan suggested

   theyve quite an estate havent they

   yes indeed and philip darrow and
mabel-that is miss darrow of course

alan said easily and looked straight at
henry baird

  and this time henry ceased his contem-
plation of the subway ventilator and looked
straight at moss two seconds they stared
thus-five seconds-ten-while their eyes
narrowed slightly and henrys color at
least rose a little it was growing quite
uncomfortable and unusual when alan with
a slight effort slid his gaze from henry and
stared at the clock on the dashboard

   good gracious is it all that time of
day he demanded  ill have to be hit-
ting the trail baird

   youre not going to try making rock-
ridge to-night henry asked

  to-night with this car moss
laughed outright  why ill be up there
before nine oclock this affair travels
when it sees an open road you know ive
got an airplane motor under that hood
boy

   ah

   yep alan agreed cheerfully and bent
a loving and attentive ear as his starter
ground for a moment and then sent out a
soft whir upon the summer air  when
she drops below fifty-five or so on a state
road i run her into the next garage and
give her a little expert attention thats
my speed you know hows your car by
the way

   well enough its not up to your
speed henry said shortly

   yes i do try to maintain a certain high
speed in every good thing mr moss
chuckled rather enigmatically after a light-
ning sidelong glance at henry as his emer-
gency-brake went out with a precise little
click and-his gears meshed with no click
at all  nevertheless you might come out
and try to catch me some day baird

  thats quite true i might henry
said darkly

  the velvet clutch went in the car
barely crawled into tremorless motion mr
moss grinned again at mr baird suddenly
and brilliantly and with a peculiar flash of
daring up rockridge way perhaps
moss suggested

  yes up rockridge way henry snarled
at him in the most remarkably emotional
manner
his word of honor



  then a canary-colored hand waved back
at him and a light-blue streak curved
around a taxicab and whizzed north and
alan moss was gone from that particular
section while henry baird his hands
clenched and his teeth gritting stared after
him alan moss with his good looks and
his good car and his rather taking manner
and his million or so tucked away in gilt-
edged paper was gone up rockridge way
while henry panted and directed a blazing
stare at the distances that had swallowed
him

  it was decidedly odd of course yet it
was no more odd than the way henry left
the ill-fated spot where alan had pulled up
beside him five minutes bapk jaws set
viciously gaze upon the pavement hands
still clenched henry breathed heavily as he
turned down the side street where stood the
apartment-hotel he called home and made
strange sounds causing several startled by-
standers to open their eyes and look after
him savage sounds they were running
from a growl to a distinctly profane rumble
and back again to a growl and they ceased
only when henry caught the inquiring stare
of the day-clerk in his hotel lobby there-
upon henry relaxed somewhat stared dark-
ly at his pigeonhole in the mail-rack and
found it empty and asked briefly

   mr terral home yet

    youll find him up-stairs sir said the
clerk  he came home half an hour ago
theres a gentleman with him waiting to
see you

  who

   why i think its mr anderson your
lawyer he-

  more than this henry failed to hear for
he was darting into the elevator the
blackness was disappearing from his coun-
tenance too hope kindled a new light and
henry was even smiling eagerly as he
stepped off at the seventh floor and strode
down to suite c at the end

  and then having entered quite boister-
ously henry stopped short whitmore ter-
ral the rather insignificant second cousin
with whom he shared his rooms was sitting
there prim as ever and anderson the
attorney smoked comfortably in the big
leather chair-but there was no expected

joyful glow on either of their faces ander-
son in fact sighed as he arose and shook
hands with henry

    thought perhaps - when they said
that you were here- escaped henry

   anderson smiled dismally shook his head
and sat down again

   you thought that everything was all
right eh and that id come to tell you
mr baird i wish that it might have been
so

   he sighed again and considered his cigar
henry having disposed of his hat and found
a cigar for himself in the dwindling box
trimmed it and lighted it and dropped into
a chair with

   well

   well youre not going to sell your
michigan copper property this week-or
next week-or the week after the lawyer
said slowly  our mr wiggins just got in
this afternoon after looking the whole thing
over on his western trip

   and-

    the man blackton still insists that the
title to the whole tract is his and not yours
mr baird the attorney said slowly
 wiggins talked with him and although he
declined to show any of the papers that are
supposed to support his claim he persisted
that they would be produced at the proper
time and establish all his contentions

   and-

   well in the crude state of some of
those early western land records we may
have the very dickens of a job proving that
hes wrong anderson sighed

chapter ii

the golden cloud

 i itt who the devil is this man
g biackton henry demanded wildly

         whoever heard of him until three
weeks ago when it was practically settled
that tilbury and tilbury here in new
york were willing to buy me out for eight
hundred thousand cash where did he
come from did he just pop out of the
ground out there to grab off property i
bought for a song two years ago with an
absolutely perfect title who-


all-story weekly

  there there mr baird said mr
bairds attorney  shouting isnt going to
help matters you know the man has faith
enough in his claim to have carried it to the
courts when you refused to buy him out
nevertheless wiggins says that he seems
reasonable enough in some ways he is still
willing to compromise

   compromise for laying claim to some-
thing thats mine henry cried

   if you choose to call it that anderson
smiled patiently  at any rate he is still
willing to drop his claim for fifty thousand
dollars you dont care to pay that i take
it

  you take it dead right henry said
hoarsely  i dont care to pay it i havent
got it to pay and-youre not advising me
to pay it are you

  the attorney favored him with a wry
smile and munched his cigar

   honestly i dont know he said
you bought that tract of land for sixty
thousand or so baird you took the gam-
ble and won because the copper certainly
is right on the job youve got a chance
now to sell out for eight hundred thousand
cash if memory serves you had a might
task getting tilbury and tilbury up to the
point of that cash offer and it is thinkable
that they may not hold it open forever
the principles rotten of course because
were virtually certain that the man black-
ton is a fake pure and simple at the
same time it might pay to buy him off
and-

  his voice trailed away as he regarded
henry henrys gaze so fiery a moment
ago had settled with curious intentness
upon a golden cloud heading toward the
sunset and just visible through the window
harder and harder stared henry at his
cloud while his eyes grew to little slits and
his lips parted and  er-are you listen-
ing mr baird

   eh henry whirled about again with a
queer dazed effect  er-of course im
listening why shouldnt i be listening
the lawyer smiled faintly in his corner
-he seemed naturally to fade into the more
shadowy spots-whitmore terral squinted
removed his shell-rimmed glasses and pol-
ished them and squinted the harder at

henry baird when he had replaced them
whitmore too had noted that unaccounta-
ble preoccupation of henrys

   your mind seemed to be straying
murmured the attorney  well you
dont feel that its worth while to pay
blackton his fifty thousand and charge it
off to profit and loss

  henry shook his head slowly but that
such a thing was manifestly absurd one
might have thought that he was gazing
straight through the lawyer and at some
unpleasant shape far beyond and there was
a distant dismal quality in his voice now
too

   no i dont feel anything of the kind
he said absently  what then

  anderson shrugged his shoulders and
reached for his hat

   things will have to take their natural
course i presume we may possibly be in
for a long wait if the thing hangs over till
the fall term of their court out there on
the other hand it may very likely be possi-
ble for us to have blacktons suit brought
to trial in a week or two i hope so

  and then whitmore suggested anx-
iously from his corner

   im no clairvoyant the attorney
laughed as he arose  i cant tell what
may happen then very possibly well run
blackton out of court in another week or
so and mr baird will sell his mine if the
tilbury offer still holds good on the other
hand its likely enough that-

  and now the unusual henry had come
quite out of his unaccountable dream
now quite fiercely he turned upon his
attorney

  no it isnt likely enough he exploded
 were going to lick blackton and lick
him inside of that week or two at the very
most dye hear at the very most

   naturally we hope-

   it isnt what we hope its what has to
be that copper tract is mine to sell and
ive got to sell it and sell it quick ive
got to get my hands on that eight hundred
thousand dollars

   but-er-why

  why because-huh henry said
his tone dropping as he caught himself
 well-er-because i have to have eight
his word of honor



hundred thousand dollars he ended
gruffly	

  half a minute or so mr anderson waited
for further light henry apparently had
no idea of furnishing it his hard steady
gaze remained upon the attorney as if
challenging him to deny the necessity of
that particular eight hundred thousand-
nd that was all and since anderson did
not know henry intimately enough to be
aware that the demon rum had never passed
his lips he entertained certain private sus-
picions and shrugged his shoulders again
and put on his hat

   most of us stand in chronic need of
about eight hundred thousand dollars of
course he said dryly  ill do whatever
can be done mr baird you know that of
course and ill let you know just as soon as
anything new appears good afternoon
well-wait just one second henry
cried and this time there was something
downright piteous in his tone  always
supposing that things do go well anderson
whats the shortest possible time in which i
may be able to sell the property

   you may sell it to-morrow if blackton
drops dead or quits the case its possible
enough that we may have him licked in-
say a month but-

   cant we lick him in less than a
month

   why if they decided to rush the thing
through we could lick him in a week of
course anderson said soothingly and ac-
complished another step toward the door
to some extent henry controlled himself
 but for the immediate present that sale
is blocked hard and fast

   very hard and uncommonly fast i
should say mr baird the attorney con-
cluded grimly  good day

  the elevator-gate had clanged behind him
before henry baird and his second cousin
whitmore terral ceased gazing at one an-
other there was a vast difference in these
two gazes whitmores was the gaze of
deep trouble sanely faced nevertheless
henrys was the gaze of a stricken animal
wounded and helpless and still infuriated
past bearing

   it is unfortunate whitmore mur-
mured  very very unfortunate

   unfortunate henry echoed savagely
 what sort of sickly little word is that-
unfortunate

   eh

   dont gape at me like that whitty
do you realize that im stuck here-stuck
fast-while he and his aviation engine-
 what

  whitmore rose suddenly drawing himself
to his full height a trifle more than five
feet with deepest concern he hurried to
his cousin and there was that in his expres-
sion which calmed henry suddenly and in
great measure permanently when whit-
more looked like that his tireless brain was
about to probe to tthe bottom of a situation

   what in the world did you mean by
that whitmore demanded

   i didnt mean anything at all his
cousin said readily  im so thundering
mad i dont know what im talking about-
thats all

   you spoke of-of an aviation engine
 i was looking at that cloud whitty
and it-lord i dont know i suppose it
suggested aviation to me what i meant
to say was  he and his claim or something
of the kind

   meaning-er-blackton

   meaning blackton of course
whitmore sighed lightly and considered
his cousin again and reading his thoughts
was no simple matter now unless one could
penetrate the back of a head henry was
staring out of the window once more

   henry there is something on your mind
-beside this copper matter i mean
whitmore said tentatively  ive never
seen you act like this before

   youve never been around when any
one tried to trim me for eight hundred thou-
sand dollars before

   but even if the sale is delayed for a
while-

   it isnt necessarily fatal eh henry
said drearily  well perhaps it isnt to
you whitty youre drawing down the
astonishing sum of fifty per week for being
private secretary to an elderly gentleman
who collects old china and writes letters to
his tenants but i havent even fifty a
week whitty ive got about two thousand
dollars worth of small bills that i see no


all-story weekly

chance of paying ive got an elderly
automobile worth four or five hundred
dollars if the market was good-which it
isnt ive got just one hundred dollars in
cash right here in my pocket -in the whole
world

   i-er-didnt know that you were quite
as low as that henry whitmore said
steadily enough  but even so that doesnt
account for your excitement

   do i have to account for it henry
muttered

   henry i-i beg your pardon but you
-you havent been drinking

   dont be an ass 

  whitmore drew a deep breath and nodded
to himself

   is it a-a woman henry he inquired

   eh

   a woman henry whitmore repeated
steadily

  a-pah hell no no it isnt a
woman henry snapped and fixed his eyes
on the distant golden cloud

  and it was a queer statement coming
from henry too the very soul of honesty
and honor henry had told a flat lie that
time because most certainly it was a
woman

  not that this was any ordinary everyday
women you understand this was the one
perfect flower of all the generations of wo-
man that have been born to earth since the
creation this woman let it be confessed
at once was none other than miss mabel
darrow - mabel the only daughter of
philip darrow who has made a number of
millions himself and is really the whole
firm of darrow  co

  and she had gone away from henry three
full weeks ago and in each of these weeks
he had somehow survived seven centuries of
gnawing loneliness and yearning and
through each of them he had looked forward
with straining eyes toward the big day when
the accursed mine should actually be sold
and his poverty-locked lips free at last
after so many agonizing months he should
dash to mabels side and gamble his whole
future happiness on a single word when he
asked-oh no that lie was fully justified
whitmore never could understand a thing
like that

  and now poverty-stricken still and likely
to remain so for a long time henry was
here in new york and mabel was in rock-
ridge massachusetts and somewhere on
the road between the two alan moss was
spinning along darrow himself liked the
cheeky little rotter too so much had been
evident on several occasions when henry
had met moss in the darrow home and-

   it is not a woman henry whitmore
repeated doubtfully

  this time henry baird did not even
bother to answer was it actually humanly
possible that a-a thing like this alan moss
stood a chance of winning her be his ob-
vious advantages what they might did
those eyes of mabels really mean nothing
at all when they looked so deeply into
henrys own-or had looked in that dead
age three weeks ago henry caught the
sigh just before it escaped and went on
staring at his golden cloud

  the cloud was breaking into little frag-
ments now and drifting away in several
directions five minutes more and it would
have vanished completely-which by the
way is the mean little trick played by many
varieties of golden cloud

chapter iii

jabs from the needleman

it may be as well to glance briefly at
whitmore terral

he was small as has been noted
where henry was distinctly big and broad
and splendidly upholstered with muscle
people passed whitmore fifty or sixty times
before they even knew of his existence
henry on the other hand caught ones
attention at the first glance with his rather
handsome countenance his long and posi-
tive stride and his general air of prosperity
and importance whitmore was very thor-
oughly educated while henry - well of
course henry was very thoroughly edu-
cated too since he had been graduated
from the same college in the same year
but it will have to be conceded that while
whitmore had carried away many rare gems
of the mind the most tangible evidences
of henrys flight through college were one
his word of honor



silver cup and two medals now in the book-
case in the evenings whitmore read
deeply and at great length while henry
wandered happily among congenial people
-and yet as a rule the pair got along won-
derfully well together

  just now whitmore sighed and returned
to the chair beside the living-rooms big
table

   i wish you felt able to tell me what
troubles you henry he said simply  it
might be that i could advise you

  henry turned away from his window the
cloud was all gone now

   you cant advise a man whos carrying
around a personal hoodoo whitty

 you have no personal hoodoo henry
 well i insist that i have henry
snapped  hes been with me for a solid
year now working overtime ive had more
pure hard luck than-

   rot said whitmore

   rot be hanged  henry cried theres
no rot about it everything i touch crum-
bles to bits everything i look at fades
away and dies everything-
twaddle said whitmore

   do you find an unusual amount of
twaddle in the way this copper sale has
fallen down henry demanded grimly yet
with a touch of sour satisfaction  five
per cent of that is yours you know whitty
it costs you forty thousand dollars to see
the thing held up 

  this time whitmore terral winced

   i am quite aware of that henry he
said gravely  i invested all that remained
of fathers fortune in the venture and it
means much to me nevertheless you do
not find me moaning about hard luck

   go ahead and moan then  henry said
savagely  youll have to moan like sin to
beat me

  - i shall not moan at all whitmore
smiled soberly  i am not a believer in
hard luck

   what do you call it then

    in your case as a broad general propo-
sition i should say that it was a genius for
doing the wrong thing henry oh not so
much in the matter of this copper tract
perhaps but in other things let us con-
sider your case point by point and-

   whitty henry said almost danger-
ously  let us can that didactic stuff when
a man has absolutely nothing left on earth
he doesnt want to be considered point by
point

   you have a great deal left said whit-
more you have youth and health and-
spotless honor henry

   eh

   you have the blood of the terrals in
your veins henry concluded henrys
cousin with downright solemnity

  henry grinned tartly at him

   why you havent sprung that one in
six or eight months whitty said he
 whats the idea of it now

   to steady you for one thing perhaps
sighed whitmore  youre in quite an ab-
normal state this afternoon your perspec-
tive seems entirely shattered my dear boy
you are magnifying a mere annoyance into
a positive calamity why a little while ago
you seemed downright hysterical

  henry said nothing at all on the book-
case the little clock was just preparing to
strike the hour of six there is not so much
traffic on the boston post road at that time
on a week-day at a guess because he was
a superb driver alan moss had about
passed the suburban districts by now and
was preparing for some real speed another
space he would run along the sound slow-
ing down through a pretty town whizzing
on again slowing down for another then
he would head north and open her up in
good earnest and-he meant to visit with
the darrows themselves this time henry
concluded suddenly and with a start

  that had been the significance of his
mention of  visiting around  and of the
unusually self-confident grin yes that was
it he meant to stay at the darrow place in
rockridge which henry had never even
seen and they expected him-mabel ex-
pected him-and there would be a late
dinner waiting for him doubtless to be
enjoyed alone with mabel because henry
recalled all too vividly a dozen remarks
which indicated that darrow spent most of
his evenings at the rockridge country
club and all of this while henry sat in
suite c

  he clasped his hands and sighed shud-


all-story weekly

deringly he set his teeth it seemed to
henry that he must see mabel darrow
again or-yes actually literally die that
sort of thing really does happen when one
has postponed the first real falling in love
to the ripe old age of twenty-eight henry
groaned and-

   but dont take it so much to heart
hen whitty said quite kindly and it
was evident that he had been talking for
some time  i dont mean to distress you
unduly but that ridiculous notion of hard
luck must be exorcised-really remember
that the terrals have never been whipped
boy remember that the terral honor-
 yes i know all about the terral honor
whitty ive never soiled it at all and i
never shall henry said briefly  that has
nothing to do with being marooned here
with the last hundred dollars and no real
prospects for weeks

   it has much to do with just that
henry said his cousin and leaned back
thoughtfully  now suppose that we
analyze quite calmly-

  he might have done just that too save
that the telephone bell selected just that
second to ring briskly henry started
nervously and gazed at it whitmore on
the other hand after noting the start and
frowning perplexedly arose with entire calm
and stepped to the instrument he listened
and grunted an affirmative he turned back
to henry

  larkin he said simply

chapter iv

a visit from mr larkin

 t h my tailor henry smiled sadly
h  tell him to go to blazes whitty
i cant afford any more clothes for a

while

   are you sure you havent ordered any
lately 

   quite sure why

   larkins coming up here with a bundle
for you henry

  henry scowled and shook his head

   hes made some mistake or other he
muttered without concern  it isnt my
bundle whitty i rather wish it was

   when it is barely a month since he
made you three new suits henry whit-
more exclaimed

  in the hallway the elevator gate had
rattled again the little buzzer on the door
of the suite whined energetically-and lar-
kin and his bundle were with them

  he entered very briskly did the little
tailor he nodded at whitmore and closed
the door after him with his foot which was
an odd little thing to do and not at all like
the usual larkin as a rule he carried an
air of fitting and flattering humility with
him that seemed to have been left some-
where else this late afternoon

  still he smiled at henry who had ab-
sorbed none of these details and henry
srpiled at him with a careless

   not my stuff larkin youve made a
mistake

  mr larkins smile broadened

   i know its not your stuff sir but i
havent made any mistake its just linings
in that bundle

   eh

   in a house like this its a bit easier to
get up-stairs without a lot of questions if
youre delivering something the caller in-
formed him and laid his package on the big
davenport and his hat atop the package
after which he straightened up and looked
directly at henry baird

  henry grinned absently

   i suppose so he agreed  but youve
wasted your ingenuity this time larkin i
dont care to order any more clothes just
yet

   i hadnt thought of asking you to order
any sir the tailor informed him quietly
 ft wasnt about that that i called

   no

   no it was about the three suits i made
for you over two months ago sir the caller
said significantly- and waited

   oh they were all right henry assured
him

   i know they were mr baird larkin
agreed  but theyve left a little balance on
my books that isnt quite so much all right
so to speak

   what

   a matter of three hundred and fifty
dollars sir
his word of honor



  henrys smile faded and a scowl whisked
into its place

    it  be paid in due time larkin he
snapped

   exactly mr baird but that might
leave a sort of diversity of opinion as you
may say about just what due time means
the tailor said steadily yet smilingly

   well it means in this case that when i
get mighty good and ready to pay you
youll get your check henry thundered
for on this particular afternoon he was in
no mood at all to bandy words with tailors

  and this of course was mr larkins cue
to gasp a little and snatch up his package
and fade swiftly from the picture yet he
must have missed his cue for he did none
of these things instead his eyes hardened
and his chin stuck forward a little and he
kept on looking at henry baird

   quite so said he  and ive no doubt
you find that sort of thing very effective
with some people but it doesnt go with me
at all mr baird

   whats that cried henry unbeliev-
ingly since his hearing seemed to have gone
astray

  the thing simply couldnt be happening
you see robbins who had made henrys
clothes for a dozen years or until his poor
old failing eyes really made a change of
tailors imperative could no more have made
a speech like that than he could have
spread his elderly arms and flown away
toward the moon larkin wasnt doing it
either although

   thats exactly what i said  larkin
repeated  it doesnt go at all with me
mr baird

   well upon my soul- gasped henry
 now  think if youll just drop that
bunk indignation sir well get on much
better the unusual tailor rapped out
 lets see where we stand sir this was
my first order from you wasnt it

   and the last choked henry baird

   like enough agreed mr larkin with-
out a single visible tear  you came to
me from robbins sir and i didnt ask you
why youd made the change-although i
may say that sometimes i suspicion them
that are slow pay however i did your
work in the very best fashion

   eh yes

   and promptly

   i presume so henry said coldly for
he was recovering himself and preparing the
icy blast of words that should send larkin
running

   and ill tell you mr baird that theres
no finer woolens and no finer linings and
no finer workmanship than what you got
in them three suits the tailor pursued
energetically  all right i did my part
now im asking vou to do yours thats
all

   larkin henry began heavily

  im willing to give thirty days sir
ill give sixty if i have to but when a
gent doesnt show any signs of paying
inside of sixty days i come after the money
and i get it

  his wretched chin stuck farther forward
his eyes shot a hot unpleasant light that
had its own most peculiar effect on the icy
torrent about to leave henrys lips if ever
an untutored savage of a tailor meant busi-
ness it was this larkin person and really
the best that henry could do was a hoarse
very well youve said enough go
ill see that youre paid shortly

   well ill see that im paid right here
and now sir 

   you cant collect from me by any such
tactics larkin henry said threateningly

  oh yes  can larkin corrected
briskly  ill tell you why ive got a man
in my shop who used to work for robbins
and he tells me that you were frequently
eight or ten months behind and that you
owe robbins money right now thats
robbinss business  run mine differently
ive got a pretty good line on people like
you mr baird either youve got no money
at all and i know better than that or
youre-well i may as well say it and end
any misunderstanding-or youre trying to
be a dead beat 

   why you infernal- henry began

   so i ask you just once more will you
pay that bill now sir

   i will not said henry

   will you pay half of it now sir

   i willnot said henry and the more
he strove to render his voice infuriated
the more it sought to thin out


all-story weekly

   then ill tell you quite honestly mr
baird that im going to give you until day
after to-morrow to reconsider the thing-
and after that im going to sue you

   what

   im going to show you up the tailor
said angrily  i mean that too im going
to advertise you for just what you are
mr baird well

   i think id pay him henry whitmore
suggested unexpectedly for in the excite-
ment he had quite lost track of henrys
financial condition

  ill do nothing of the sort henry
said thickly

  larkin shook his head and gathered up
his hat and his package

   i thought i hadnt made any mistake
he said unpleasantly ive got five cases
like yours and im going to make an ex-
ample of one of them youll be it i think
good evening

  he nodded and walked straight out slam-
ming the door after him it may be that
he waited in the corridor to be called back
because it was some time before the elevator
ascended to remove him if so he was
wholly disappointed they did not call him
back there was no occasion at all for any-
thing of that sort

  instead they gazed round-eyed at one
another whitmore was rather pale henry
himself was distinctly red with a shiny film
upon his forehead

   hell do it henry said hoarsely

   i think he will mused whitmore

   and you know what it means dont
you henry pursued with agitation that
soared by the second  it means that ill
be advertised as a plain pauper whitmore
it means that everybody  know im stone
broke it means that tilbury  tilbury 
know it

   but-

  ive been putting up a considerable
bluff around that office whitty ive been
posing as a rather wealthy person who
doesnt really care whether he sells out his
copper property or not that chiefly is
how i got them worked up to paying eight
hundred thousand dollars-and once they
find out that its a matter of life or death
to me-

  he broke off for his voice caught he
laughed bitterly at whitmore then  well
do you believe in my hard luck now he
demanded

  whitmore swallowed the rather scared
little lump in his throat and was himself

  no  do not he said tartly the
things an infernal nuisance of course but
it isnt going to ruin us by any means

   have you got three hundred and fifty
dollars to choke him off with

   no i havent whitmore said with a
sad little smile  i havent put aside any-
thing these last months you know what
with the-er-rent here and one thing and
another still thats not important you
can borrow that much henry

   from whom

   well-peters might lend it to you

   yes and hed tell every soul he met
about it

  he might whitmore conceded well
why not-why not try joe plant henry
he has plenty of money

   who

   joe plant of course youve known
him a good many years

   yes and id rather go to the news-
stand at the corner and try to borrow money
from the old man there henry said with
more than a touch of contempt for his
cousins intelligence  why joe plant hates
me worse than i hate him 

   joe

   of course we passed a good part of
our boyhood punching each others heads
hes detested me since the first time he laid
eyes on me and i feel about the same to-
ward joe anyway hes not in town

   where is he

   honeymooning somewhere or other-
up tolver manor way i believe thats
another count he has against me you
know said henry and grinned suddenly
 his wife-evelyn

   eh

  yep henry chuckled i-i had a
sort of temporary obsession about evelyn
you know a year and a half ago and
evelyn seemed rather taken with me too
whitty in fact ill admit to you now
that we were engaged for about forty-eight
hours although it wasnt advertised
his word of honor



  henry said whitmore who did not
take these things lightly

   and then we both woke up thank
heaven and joe came along with his brute
cave-man stuff and won her and married her
for which by the way im duly grateful
im not strong for these ladies who feed
on emotion and fancy the whole world
in love with em because theyre fairly good-
looking and vampish and-all that sort of
tommyrot whitty but id never ask a
favor of plant if it was to save my neck
boy think up somebody else

   ill try muttered whitmore and sat
down suddenly and buried his head in his
hands

  now it might have been supposed that
henry too would have devoted his whole
brain to the canvassing of prospects as it
chanced he did nothing of the kind
drearily enough henry walked back to the
window and resumed his study of the sky
which was darkening now

  by this time he suspected alan moss
was past stamford drawing nearer and
nearer and nearer to mabel henry shut
his teeth hard and rammed his hands into
his pockets and he was here dunned by
a tailor who threatened to- henry started
visibly

  astonishment came to his features-and
then a frown-and then a very curious in-
tent expression which indicated deep quick
thought there is such a thing of course
as combining discretion and inclination
business and pleasure in fact considering
his secret mental state it was rather odd
that the inspiration had not come to henry
within two seconds of larkins departure
his lips parted and he nodded to the outer
dusk he smiled quickly and eagerly

   now it is just possible- whitmore
began

   never mind whether it is or not
henry said so briskly so differently that
whitmore blinked at him through the
glasses  i cant afford to take the risk of
going around and borrowing little sums of
money just now its too beastly obvious
and its unnecessary anyway ive got the
answer to the whole thing ill disappear

   youll do what

   just disappear early to-morrow morn-

ing whitty ill take the car and strap on
the little trunk of clothes and roll out of
town for a week or two

  he laughed with real blitheness and
while it may be too much to say that sus-
picion welled up with new force in whit-
more it is certain that he looked very nar-
rowly indeed at his cousin

   yes and in-er-just what direction
were you thinking of rolling he asked

   eh oh that doesnt matter so that
im out of the way said henry and gave
an excellent imitation of a man pausing to
give brief consideration to a matter of
really small importance  ill probably
head up new england way ill keep you
advised as to where i am of course i may
make-er-rockridge by to-morrow night
-or no ill probably stop off at new
bingham twenty miles this side theyve
got a pretty decent hotel there i believe
 you have friends at new bingham
 friends new bingham no certain-
ly not said henry and treated his cousin
to a smile of childlike innocence that con-
trasted almost uncannily with his perturba-
tion of five minutes ago

   and suppose something comes up in
this mine matter that needs your atten-
tion

   youll look after it because ill leave a
power of attorney with you whitty

  and now whitmore stared the harder
and having stared he came closer to henry
and laid a hand on his arm

   henry old man said he  just what
is behind all this

   eh henry scowled  what the devil
should be behind it

   dont bluster whitmore said steadily
 i know that theres something behind it
henry i feel it you-you may have
thought i didnt notice it but you have been
far from yourself these last two or three
weeks youve been irritable and - and
-preoccupied-and-jumpy 

   piffle said henry

   manifestations of that kind usually
have a woman somewhere in the back-
ground whitmore smiled rather timidly
and apologetically  you know i-i hesi-
tate to say anything of the kind hen but
youre a - a handsome cuss and women


all-story weekly

seem attracted to you and ive been won-
dering if-if-

   well you quit your wondering right
now henry said sternly if im not
here that little rat cant serve a summons
and complaint on me can he

   no

    well thats why im leaving town are
you ready for dinner

   you believe that you can run away
from your-vour  hard luck as you call
it

 yep

   trouble can travel faster than any au-
tomobile henry sighed whitmore and
there he ceased for a little and took to
studying henry intently  theres a very
bright spot on each of your cheeks  whit-
more finished irrelevantly

   its a good thing youre able to find a
bright spot somewhere henry submitted
cheerily for the last detail had settled itself
in his mind during the past minute  lets
eat

chapter v

with trouble at his heels

repexvtedly during that first forty
miles of rolling through the bright
morning sunshine henry baird was
forced to grin at the white road ahead as
he thought of whitmore

  whitmore you see had spent the better
part of a vain evening in trying to point out
the folly of leaving town at all he had
sought with deep earnestness to impress
upon henry that even when one travels
alone one hundred dollars is very limited
capital for a motor trip he had dwelt at
length upon several minor weak spots in
henrys rather elderly car which might
give way and call for attention which in
turn meant cash outlay he had mentioned
the high cost of living and its bearing on
hotel rates he had mentioned as well
about everything else that had occurred to
him and that might possibly have some de-
terring effect upon henry-and the best
he had received in return was the calm
smile of henrys unaltered determination

  so that now henry bowled along with

his back toward new york and his eyes
toward new england and the very curious
thing is that lifes pathway had smoothed
itself out automatically and the future held
nothing but good for henry baird that
persistent run of hard luck had been left
behind he seemed to know it-that was
all the man blackton and his ridiculous
claim would be thrown from the michigan
courts the mine would be sold to tilbury
and tilbury for the full eight hundred thou-
sand dollars and more immediately and
more important henry baird would look
again upon mabel before night

  aye with a little care henry might look
upon her for two solid weeks rockridge
has an hotel of excellent repute and prices
not too exorbitant there henry would be
settled before dark to-night perhaps he
would run over to the darrow place and-
oh just pop in unexpectedly after he had
scrubbed off the road dust and extracted
his evening clothes or his white flannels
from the shiny little trunk just now
strapped to the back of the car

  henry sighed and slumped down com-
fortably behind his wheel one hundred
dollars can be made to go a long long way
-particularly if nobody suspects that it is
your last hundred from clothes and shoes
down to collars and tooth-paste supplies for
a good deal more than two weeks were in
that shiny black trunk five dollars a day
ought to suffice for the inn and to the best
of his knowledge there were few ways of
spending loose change up at rockridge
yes carefully stretched his hundred dol-
lars would- henry aroused suddenly that
loud report had been in his immediate
neighborhood henry slowed down and
craned over the side for a view of his left
rear tire

  full of miles and hard service its end
had come at last even as he stopped a
jagged fragment as large as ones hand
stretched out sickeningly from the flattened
wreck henry stepped out and stared at it
with heart pounding rather more energeti-
cally henry spoke too although it were
better not to dwell too minutely upon his
words in a broad way they indicated his
opinion of the tire that had been later
they sketched in the self-evident fact that
his word of honor



there was no spare tire on the rear nor had
there been for a month or so

  still it is only your craven soul that
permits itself to be stopped by minor ob-
stacles it was bitter enough to be sure
since every penny expended on the road
must shorten his rockridge stay but the
garage down at the foot of the hill had a
window full of nice new casings visible
even at this distance henry smiled grimly
and bumped his way to the foot of the
grade

  he was the poorer by an even fifty dol-
lars when he resumed his tour and he had
ceased to smile so broadly his bursts of
speed were less frequent too and his look-
out for sharp stones grew far more keen-
and when lunch-time came well up in con-
necticut henry turned his back upon the
alluring place with its outdoor tables and
its hurrying waiters and paused at the
humble little bakery where he consumed
buns and sweet fresh milk

  and now real hills were appearing and
henry was in massachusetts with rock-
ridge not more than fifty miles ahead they
were harder hills than henry had imagined
too he seemed to have all manner of diffi-
cult in getting up them to-day that was
downright odd because whatever else might
be said for it this old reliable car usually
negotiated anything short of the side of a
house without complaint henry found
himself frowning over the queer unac-
countable skip in his motor poor gas was
probably the cause he tried a new car-
buretor adjustment

  and the skip persisted and grew worse
it sounded more like faulty ignition now
with another fifteen miles of increasingly
difficult going behind henry paused again
took out his spark-plugs one by one and
scrubbed their points carefully they did
not seem particularly in need of cleaning
nor did their scrubbing bring any marked
improvement

  the first cold dread as to the real cause
came just as he passed the crossroads with
its  new bingham-fourteen miles  sign
and its little cluster of houses ahead he
might try hard as he chose to deny it
but the fact was that his motor had gone
through two full revolutions just then with-

out firing in a single cylinder henry
pushed at his horn button from the horn
came one faint sad little squeak and noth-
ing more ahead on the concrete garage
loomed like the writing of fate the words
 battery service station henry stopped
and called without entlisiasm for the bat-
tery man

  and presently this kindly person looked
up from the cavern he had been exploring
under henrys driving-seat and said

   how longs this battery been in broth-
er

   it must be two years how long will it
take you to fix it

  the kindly one smiled sadly

   brother theres no fix to a battery
thats run six months longer than it has any
license to run this ones stone dead y
know

   er-er-all worn out henry gasped

  absolute and complete

   ill have to-to buy a new one henry
inquired with a wan and slightly bewildered
smile

   you will unless you want to stop here
with us a spell brother

  how-how much asked henry baird

   forty-three fifty for this type-five off
for cash of course-and its only luck we
got one of em in stock thats the old
price im giving you too brother shall i
stick her in

  he waited without much sympathy since
henry was so evidently a prosperous per-
son possibly he wondered why henry
stared so fixedly at the sky-line to the north
there was a matter of thirty-four miles be-
tween henry and rockridge

  no smile at all played about his lips as
he rolled out of the village with his new
storage battery under the seat yet this
was more by reason of henrys deep pre-
occupation than because of any real sad-
ness to some small extent whitmore had
certainly been right henry had not quite
succeeded in distancing his hard luck one
or two of the tentacles had reached after
him from new york and stripped his pock-
ets of all but seven or eight dollars

  still while it altered his plans there was
nothing wholly disastrous about that one
good thing about a car of standard make


all-story weekly

 s that it has a certain fairly fixed value at
 all times henry would have to sell his
 car at new bingham and in some ways that
 would be better for it meant that he would
 have much more loose money in his pocket
 when he made rockridge on an early eve-
 ning local

 in a place like new bingham he fancied
 one should get a pretty good price for this
 kind of car henry frowned meditatively
 and spun along about six hundred dollars
 would be the right figure for a beginning
 he thought he might have to shade that a
 trifle although not much more than fifty
 dollars-and there by the way were the
 spires of new bingham just over the hill

 henry thrilled and put on a little extra
 speed entering the town with quite a swirl
 of dust and coming to a rather effective stop
 before the one big garage a soured-look-
 ing man shuffled out evidently under the
 impression that henry wished to buy gas

  i want to see the boss henry said
 crisply

  keep on looking the other advised

  youre he

  im him said the soured one un-
 smilingly

  do you-er-buy cars

   h-m now and then

 id like to sell you this one henry
 laughed cheerily

 the soured one peered at him-and at
 the car-and at henry again-and then
 seemed to back into his shell

  what you asking

  six hundred cash

  as is

  without the trunk of course

 followed a period of deep silence where-
 in the native sent his eyes from front to
 rear from top to bottom of henrys motor
  i dont see it

  i might shade that figure a little

 uhuh how much

  shall we call it five fifty henry in-
 quired

  you pretty anxious to sell

   oh no-no said henry  but im
 not going to have much more use for a car
 this summer and-

  your car of course

  well naturally

   youre-touring hev

   yes

   and you just got the notion youd sell
the car and quit touring eh the soured
one asked curiously

   you have said it henry laughed

  the other backed farther into his shell
he seemed rather to have forgotten henry
too he stared down the main street for a
space and then up the main street he
scratched a match on his  no smoking 
sign and lighted his pipe keenly he
peered at henry baird

   give you one hundred and fifty spot
cash he shot forth

  youll give me-what

   one fifty and not a cent more

  henry baird caught his breath and
still-unless he wished to start out and
drum the town for another buyer it really
seemed to lie between taking this criminals
hundred and fifty dollars or turning back
homeward again one does not spend a
week or two in rockridge on eight dollars

  all right ill let it go at that  henry
said bitterly

  the soured one did not even remove his
pipe but his eye sparkled curiously

   you wont let it go at that around
here he stated

   eh

  you listen to me you darned crook
the sour person said astonishingly  you
aint the first one thats stole a car and
brought it here to sell and you wont be
the last but at that im gettin darned sick
of it d ye hear im gettin sick of
being taken for a blasted fool

   i-i-what are you talking about
henry stammered

   thats all right dont you get red
and shout at me im wise to ye and i
aint afraid of ye said the other and
backed away a pace  nobodys selling a
car like that at any such figure that come
by it honest you beat it

   why you-you confounded old-

   say listen cried the garage-man  i

ment but if you want to stick around a

baird bitterly as he climbed back behind
his wheel again

chapter vi

two hundred chances

another sale was shattered he
would dono more peddling of his car
in new bingham because this pes-
simistic individual in all probability would
shuffle in to his telephone and warn any
other garages that might be in town for
that matter if he chose to warn his con-
stable henry baird was in no mood for
effective protest

  he had wronged whitmore whitmore
was utterly right there are certain kinds
of hoodoo which one cannot leave behind
henry owned a fine healthy specimen of
the breed and-oh what was the matter
with him anyway he looked around at
new binghams chief residential street with
its handsome houses set far back and its
lawns and smiling hurrying people and
happy children surely enough what was
the matter with him in a world packed
with joy and opportunity and any number
of other good things it is only the weakest
kind of weakling who permits himself to be
depressed by a demented garage keeper

  henry straightened up and even laughed
aloud partly at the man and partly in
scorn at himself he was very nearly
through new bingham now and still head-
ing toward rockridge and- what in the
world was the big festivity over there
henry turned toward it and slowed down

  the big white church appeared to be the
center but there were tents and booths and
gay trappings all over the huge lawn and
in the big smooth field behind as well
there were people around by the hundreds
too-women in gala attire and girls and
girls and girls and still more girls with a

man or two here and there there was a
band off in the distance-and there were
even girls on henrys running-board and one
little sixteen-year-old was crying

   come right in here at the big gate
theres no admission

  henry grinned doubtfully

   er-just what is it

   the fair for the new organ of course
   well im afraid-

   well just come in for a minute and
look around  a musical voice beside his
left ear importuned  you can park your
car out behind the church and-oh just
look at what were doing and-

  they had fairly swamped him now he
seemed to be turning in of no particular
accord of his own a fat pink hand reached
over and jabbed incessantly at his horn-
button as he rolled slowly through the
crowd bringing a scurrying and a chorus
of care-free laughter at every jab

   youve come up from new york an-
other voice was asking him

   just to-day said henry

   well then - just stop here this is
good enough - girls heres somebody
come all the way from new york just to
attend the fair mr singer

  a plump benign person mainly in black
detached himself from a surging knot of
femininity and approached with quiet
kindly dignity the same voice shrilled

   oh mr singer heres-whats your
name

   baird  henry confessed rather faintly
 heres mr baird from new york he
wants to help too

  a large soft white hand shook henrys
a low carefully modulated voice assured
him

   were very glad indeed to welcome you
mr baird our girls have turned out won-
derfully for the new organ dont you
think

  they have indeed henry agreed

   wed never have done a thing if it
hadnt been for mr singer a new voice
informed him enthusiastically  mr singer
just does absolutely everything thats to be
done in the church here

  oh miss reece mr singer pro-
tested benevolently


all-story weekly

   oh but you do you know you do
if it wasnt for mr singer-

  here a chorus coming from nowhere in
particular and for no particular reason
drowned the words the group surged
away from henry mr singer smiled hap-
pily

   our girls are workers mr baird he
mused

   they-er-yes they do seem to be
henry agreed  youve raised the money
for the organ i hope

   well we expect to raise it before the
evening is out said mr singer  things
are going a little slowly as yet and t-yes
miss donaldson

  a statuesque blonde was beckoning him
he mumbled his excuses to henry and hur-
ried away-and henry himself settled back
with an astonished little sigh certainly
he had been projected into a new atmos-
phere with something of a rush and at an-
other time and under other circumstances
he might have drawn a good deal of fun
from mr singer and the racing girls and
all the rest of it just now henry thought
-since there was no earthly reason for his
being just here-he would make an incon-
spicuous escape and-

   wont you buy a chance on my crazy-
quilt asked a rather maddening combina-
tion of red hair and violet eyes bounding
to henrys side

   well im afraid- henry began

   just one theyre only a dollar just
one chance

  and she laid the little printed ticket on
his knee and looked at henry and henry
even grinned when he had handed her the
dollar and pocketed the slip

   and youll have to take a chance on my
banana-tree a thin sparkling little girl
informed him from the other side oh
yes you will if you bought one from her
yes you will mr baird its a lovely
tree and some time or other therell be
bananas on it-and its only a dollar

  so henry bought another chance and
as the sparkling little girl twinkled off into
the crowd again henry drew a long breath
and placed his heel on the starter-button if
he meant to retain the price of an evening
meal it was time to leave

  and she who must unquestionably have
been new bingltams very loveliest daugh-
ter had glided to the side of his car and
laid both fair hands thereon

   there are just two chances left for the
sun-dial she confided to henry  wont
you buy them theyre only two dollars
apiece 

   i might-might-i might take one of
them  henry stuttered

   oh do buy both

   but-

  do buy them pleaded new bing-
hams prize beauty and there was no deny-
ing that she was an almighty attractive girl
and that her eyes were little short of won-
derful  its such a little thing you know
but it all helps with the organ and mr
singer has worked so hard and he counts
so much on us

  there was a mere five-dollar bill shrink-
ing timidly and alone into the very bottom
of henrys pocket yet she who had had
two chances left had none at ah when she
had handed henry his dollar in change

  then she was gone and henry was
breathing heavily to all intents he was
penniless now and-how had it happened
he could not as yet understand and why
must it have happened that he was even
less able to grasp it was merely the way
fate played with henry baird he assumed
or-henry sat up and blinked was it
possible yes it really did seem to be
possible fate had relented and decided to
allot to henry baird at least one real in-
spiration 

  a minute or more he sat quite still re-
volving the idea and its possibilities ob-
livious even to the vivid little brunette who
asked him thrice if he would not take just
one chance on the spanish leather armchair
in mrs fosdicks booth then henry de-
scended and pushed his way through the
throng until his hand rested upon the plump
arm of mr singer himself

   may  have just a moment with you
henry asked

   you certainly may my dear sir said
mr singer and his head inclined attentive-
ly led henry to the shady side of the
smaller ice-cream tent  what is it mr
baird
his word of honor



   i want to help here  said henry

   ah beamed mr singer  whatever
you wish to subscribe to the organ fund-
i cant subscribe - im too poor i
really am you know henry said earnestly
 but i have an aiitomobile here that i
dont use very much and ive been thinking
of selling it anyway

   and you wish to donate it mr singer
asked clasping his hands happily

   id like to but i cant even afford to
do that sighed henry baird  what
just occurred to me was this we might
take the thing and raffle it off-say two
hundred chances at two dollars apiece
that would make four hundred and id be
very willing to take three hundred of it and
hand the other hundred to the organ fund
it is possible that the faintest shade of
disappointment passed over mr singers
benign countenance if so it persisted for
no more than the smallest fraction of a
second then mr singer was wringing
henrys hand

   my dear sir you are very much more
than good he cried in the name of
our congregation  thank you most heartily
and- he wrung the hand again as his
eye drifted critically over the throng
 youre willing to do this immediately
 of course

   there couldnt be a better time mur-
mured mr singer briskly  the young
ladies have sold off most of the chances on
the smaller articles and the larger ones were
saving until evening  believe that your
car sir will fill most beautifully a little gap
that i had hardly suspected until you made
your suggestion he beckoned and a nice-
looking boy hurried to him  this is our
amateur sign-painter harry masters he
beamed

   harry mr baird here is going to do-
nate his car to the fair you go with him
and take it down to the middle of the back
lawn and fix up a sign and-oh miss wells
just a moment miss wells were going
to sell two hundred chances on an automo-
bile at two dollars apiece will you call in
all the young ladies and see if we cant sell
them out with a rush ill write the tickets
i think

  he felt about in his pocket and found

    	a-s

a pencil he beamed around again in search
of paper and since there were several sheets
of the brown wrapping variety on the
counter of the ice-cream tent he selected
one and folded it and tore it  you might
tell harry the best points of the car mr
baird and he will put them on his sign

  he plodded tirelessly into the ice-cream
tent and settled himself at a table henry
hurried off with young mr master

  and really when one came to watch
closely the speed and efficiency with which
they handled things at this particular fair
were downright amazing a little space
henry watched the boy sketching in his
sign then a tornado of femininity seemed
to swirl down on them by way of inspecting
the car it was about to sell a minute or so
it surged about then it broke up and ran
in a dozen directions and henry having
unstrapped his little shiny trunk and laid
it aside strolled away for a further study
of the indefatigable mr singer

  the gentleman was bobbing about in the
thicker spots now girls ran to him squeal-
ing delightedly-and ran away again wav-
ing brown paper slips-and other girls ran
to him and handed him green bills with a
yellow one here and there indicating that
some daring soul had risked as much as ten
dollars in chances stately ladies hurried
to mr singer too and bright young men
while henry lounged and watched and fre-
quently refused to buy chances on his own
car

  and then with a significant inclination
of his head toward henry mr singer was
heading for the inner recesses of the ice-
cream tent again henry followed to the
last table at the rear where mr singer was
counting money he beamed up at henry

   there is your three hundred dollars
mr baird-thanks to our energetic young
ladies and there is another good one hun-
dred toward our organ thanks to you

  he went so far as to wring henrys hand
again very feelingly and this time when
he had tucked the mass of small bills into
his trousers pocket henry was able to re-
turn the clasp with real heartiness

  not half an hour ago ruin and despair
had been his portion now following the
peculiar jerky course that seemed to be


all-story weekly

part of his destiny events had straightened
out beautifully he would spend perhaps
not one or two but three or four weeks at
rockridge

chapter vii
fates further freaks

the projected organs one hundred dol-
lars was sealed in an envelope and
marked in mr singers oddly scrawl-
ing hand he considered it lovingly

  im a wretched writer he mused
 still i think thats clear enough youve
done a very splendid thing here mr
baird

   nonsense henry said airily

   oh but i insist that you have you
have friends among the congregation per-
haps

   not one 

   then your act is just so much more
commendable sir now let me see i sup-
pose wed better draw for the car at once
i think ill find little josie wilbur and see
if her mother wont let her draw the winning
ticket youll be down there in the
meadow mr baird and tell the winner
whatever he or she may want to know
about the car most of our people drive
but all cars have their own little peculiari-
ties

  ill be there henry smiled absently

  so mr singer hurried away again and
since the ladies up at the forward end of
the tent seemed wholly occupied with their
two freezers and their dishes and business
was decidedly slow back here henry dug
out his latest capital and smoothed out the
bills more carefully

  a few tens there were and more fives
with two-dollar bills beyond number he
assorted them chuckling and rolled them
into smaller compass and for a little while
he stared at the white enameled top of the
table and pondered

  there would be an early evening train
for rockridge he would catch that be-
cause all trains stopped here at new bing-
ham and have himself at the inn in time
for a rather late dinner probably enough
then since he had not been through the

little mountain summer colony for several
years and remembered little of its geogra-
phy he would make inquiry as to the loca-
tion of the darrow place and after that
if it was within strolling distance he would
stroll over

  he would collide with alan moss of
course he grinned unpleasantly at the
table with three hundred dollars in his
pocket he fancied he would give alan to
understand that he had arrived for the
better part of the summer-and mabel was
not markedly enthusiastic about motoring
even in pale-blue sport cars but she did
want to learn a real game of golf-and
alan trying to cover nine holes under three
or four hundred was a sight to bring tears
from the angels whereas henry was rather
good in a small way

  for a while this afternoon henry had
been on the verge of real depression but he
was able to face the future fearlessly enough 
now in fact henry looked the future
right in the eye and grinned securely he
was not banking on it at all of course but
some little inner voice informed henry that
his luck had turned and that from this point
onward things would go rather smoothly
yesterday what with anderson and larkin
and getting down to his last hundred and
all the rest he had been rather groggy and
confused now all things ahead wore a
brighter aspect he was sure of a breathing
spell and in it now that he had banished
that absurd  hard luck  thought matters
would straighten out naturally and happily

  so henry sighed pleasantly and gazed at
the roof of the warm little tent for another
spell and then strolled out into the crowd
again and looked around

  more than a little did he wish that singer
had said nothing about waiting to instruct
the winner of his old faithful car it would
have pleased henry better just then to find
a hacking-car and load his little trunk
aboard and then get down to the railroad-
or if he was willing to do it at any reason-
able figure to let the hacking-car take him
straight over to rockridge

  yes that was the idea anyway no mat-
ter what they charged that would take
him into rockridge before any evening train
and in a car he could make inquiries and
his word of honor



get the iocation of the darrow home even
before going to the hotel henry frowned
thoughtfully at the gathering and wondered
where one obtained a hacking-car without
going to the garage which had already ac-
cused one of being an automobile thief
and as he wondered the very girl who had
steered him into the grounds ran to his side
with a breathless

  oh mr baird

 who won it smiled henry  you
 your car oh i dont know i think
theyre just drawing now it wasnt that i
wanted to say theres some one looking
for you mr baird

  still henry merely smiled on

   i mean a stranger you know i think
he just came up from the train-theres
the taxi he came in over there

   from the train looking for me
henry frowned

   yes a-a little man with glasses i
think its business-or something very im-
portant he-oh there he is see him
the little man with the funny felt hat
then she had flitted away again out-
wardly a very good and pretty little fairy
and actually - and the notion came to
henry like a hammer blow-a messenger
of the blackest evil because the man with
the funny light hat was whitmore terral

  he was darting here and there making
inquiries ah and now he had collided
with mr singer himself - yes and mr
singer having shaded his eyes and located
henry was beaming and pointing and
now whitmore having nodded his thanks
was speeding toward henry

   henry gasped whitmore

   whos dead gasped henry

  what xobodv i-

   what are you doing here henry de-
manded not quite flatteringly

   ive come to find you and its only the
merest luck that made it possible i took
the chance and left the train at new bing-
ham henry and mercifully some boys
down on the main street there had noticed
your car and the shiny trunk and had seen
it come in here and-phew

  he smiled wearily at henry

   youll have to find some way of selling
your car henry

   what

   larkin 

   has he exploded again

   he-he came around again this morn-
ing henry even before i should have
started for work i had to phone mr pat-
terson and ask him if  might take the day
off he seemed so annoyed

   go on henry said grimly

   well im not sure just what it was he
came t say  think it may have been to
apologize henry for that is how he began
but when he found that you had left town
indefinitely he flew into a perfect rage
why the man has the temper of a fiend
henry he swore and stamped about the
rooms and vowed that hed expose you
and-well hes going to start suit to-mor-
row morning if you havent paid him then
a strange internal whine sounded some-
where deep in henry his fingers tightened
convulsively upon three hundred dollars

   ive done my best i canit borrow it
for you whitmore hurried on i did
get to dick norris and he lent me fifty
dollars and i just happened on old mr
cowenhoven and-and i managed to bor-
row twenty from him thats the best i
could do henry well have to sell your
car and-and take two hundred and eighty
dollars of that

  he stroked his brow again with his fine
white handkerchief henry after a strug-
gle was able to speak

   isnt-isnt there any other way of
stopping larkin he asked hoarsely

   no theres not he said that yester-
day hed have taken half and waited six
months for the rest but he said that since
youd chosen to run away hed have his
money or show you up if it drove him out
of business he meant it too -i have
never seen a man so genuinely furious
henry 

chapter viii

 too bad

then whitmore waited while henry
shut his teeth and stared over the
heads of the crowd

  whitmore seemed to have settled it all


all-story weekly

there would be no happy month at rock-
ridge for henry baird whitmore would
have to have the money and go back with
it and henry would have twenty dollars
for his own

  yet even though the sweet agony of the
thing killed him he would snatch one eve-
ning with mabel on that twenty dollars
he had started for rockridge he would go
to rockridge in spite of all the whitmores
and the larkins and the hoodoos on earth
henry then glared savagely at his second
cousin although why he should have glared
at that devoted soul was not plain even to
himself

   all righthe snapped  ive sold the
car already

   what whitmore cried joyfully

    i raffled it off right here at this fair i
got three hundred dollars for it heres
two hundred and eighty of it give it to
larkin and tell him from me to go to-

  by jove thats - thats wonderful
luck gasped whitmore come along
henry

   come where

   we can just make the down train
boy

   well you go make it i dont want
it henry snapped

  whitmore laughed outright

   you poor old chap  said he  youve
lost your bearings completely youre
coming back with me of course larkin
was the only thing that sent you out of
the city henry and now that youre going
to pay larkin in full theres no reason for
your being away-at this most important
time too

  henry said nothing whitmore laid a
hand on his arm

   thank the lord you can get back now
too something new is developing out there
in michigan henry anderson called up
early this morning to talk to you he didnt
know just what it was but its some new
development and he said he wanted to be
in close touch with you come along

  this time he tugged at henrys sleeve
henry shook him off impatiently

   im not coming he snapped

   when the-the only reason for your
absence has been removed

  henry stared down at him mentally as
it were henry shook his head there are
some faces some natures to whom it would
be downright sacrilege to communicate any-
thing in the nature of a romantic confi-
dence 

   i need a change henry said gruffly

 im going to take it for a day or two-
thats all im going to stay out of the
city

   but just when-

   i dont care a hoot what happens im
going to stay out of the city

  followed a pause of the tensest variety
extending over seconds

   where are you going to stay henry
whitmore asked very very quietly

   what over at rockridge-or some-
where else probably somewhere else
henry said hastily

   henry who lives at rockridge whit-
more asked even more quietly

   well who in the wtorld should live -
there hundreds of people henry
snapped

   yes henry but youre not being drawn
there by hundreds of people whitmore
went on with the same deadly calm  i
suspected last night that there was more
behind this trip than any desire to avoid
larkin i know it now and-henry i
want you to come home with me

   ill be home inside of two or three
days said henry

  and here an overgrown boy a native
tapped whitmore terrals shoulder

   if you wanter make that down train
boss we gotter start he said  we aint
got more n three or four minutes to spare
as it is

   when is the next through train to new
york whitmore asked swiftly

   six ten to-morrow morning

   all right go back to your cab ill
be there in a moment henry he
clutched his cousins arm  i am going
to speak very frankly to you there is
something-something-yes i will say it-
something dishonorable afoot here some-
thing you wish to hide

   bosh said henry

   very well maintain that attitude if
you choose henry  have done what i
his word of honor



could for you always i shall continue to
do what i can for you because you are a
terral but i ask you to remember henry
that the honor of the terrals through all
the generations-

   say henry began loudly  i-

   boss if you want that down train
we gotter start said the boy drifting
back  i aint going to be picked up for
speeding and they aint going to hold that
train while you stay here

   i shall have to catch it to save you
from larkin henry whitmore panted
for the last time will you come for
your own sake will you come

   whitty im awfully obliged to you
but im not in any danger henry grinned

  i dont know what it is you think im
doing but im not doing it i want to-
to stay here where i can breathe for a day
or two and im going to do it regardless
of consequences

  whitmore clasped his hands

   henry give me your word that there
is-is no woman whom you should not see
connected with all this

   whitty laughed henry  i give you
my word that so far as i know there isnt
a woman in the world i shouldnt see as you
put it and if there is she has no connection
with this is that enough

   it will have to be i suppose whit-
more said hoarsely yet relievedly neverthe-
less

  he fled to the door which the driver of
his taxicab was holding open looking
backward he entered-and he was whisked
away while henry stared after him un-
smilingly and shook his head

  and now he was free to go to rockridge
with his twenty dollars he assumed a
bitter sigh came from henry-yet a thank-
ful one followed almost immediately even
one day with mabel was far far better than
no days at all he would look up mr
singer now and make his adieus not quite
so blithely as before whitmores unfortu-
nate appearance he walked off toward the
rear of the grounds

  they had drawn for his poor old car by
this time of course henry fancied that
he would pause for a last look at it and at
the winner and-well what on earth was

all the excitement down in that direction
anyway

  people were screaming and rushing about
quite remarkably henry quickened his
pace and peered ahead it seemed that
people were being shooed away from the
automobile that had been his yes that was
it fast enough numerous young men
their arms outstretched were pushing back
countless ladies and children in every di-
rection so that the faithful automobile
stood alone in the center of an immense
circle -

  and then mr singer was waddling swift-
ly toward henry and crying

 how ever could it have started mr
baird however could it have started
 is-is that car on fire henry gasped
as the stout lady just ahead finally moved
aside and permitted him to see

   it must have happened four or five
minutes ago sir some of the boys raised
the hood and found everything blazing
there and-

   lemme get down there and put it out 
henry cried

  youll do nothing of the kind sir
said mr singer and fastened his very con-
siderable bulk to henry  the fire ex-
tinguisher is empty we tried it

  whats true too gasped henry re-
laxing

   and the whole things ablaze under-
neath now one of our young men who
has an automobile agency here says that
the fires in the gas line and that it may
reach the tank any second thats why
theyre getting the people back and-

  he said no more just -then from the
isolated spot in the middle of the circle
there had come a mighty boom flame
suddenly soared up toward the heavens
screams came from a dozen mad directions
and women fled wildly dragging children
and then the flames seemed to condense
and center their whole force on the car
itself-for the unfortunate vehicle was a
mere crackling ball of fire now

   the danger i take it is past sighed
mr singer releasing henry  it is very
unfortunate sir

  henry could not speak no expert in
junk his estimate was nevertheless rather


all-story weekly

accurate just then at a guess his car was
worth between eight- and nine dollars as
scrap metal

   it was insured of course said mr
singer

   it wasnt henry choked  the in-
surance ran out last month and they wanted
such a price for so little insurance that i
never renewed it 

  the flames roared on they were making
a wonderfully swift job of it the hair in
the cushions was blazing the floorboard
was blazing the dashboard was a bonfire
all in itself the little bottle of ether which
henry kept for cold weather starting ex-
ploded with a nice little pop of its own

there in the side pocket even the spokes
of the wheels had caught now and grass
around the car was beginning to sizzle and
curl

  too bad mr singer said resignedly
somebody will be sorely disappointed

  yes henry muttered in thick be-
wilderment

  mr singer nodded then quite as if
henrys share of the proceeds was not al-
ready racing toward new york in whit-
mores pocket mr singer saw fit to make
another remark

   too bad indeed he repeated  now
we shall have to refund the whole four
hundred dollars 

to be continued next week dont forget this magazine is issued weekly and
that you will get the continuation of this story without waiting a month

time has little to do with reputation
in thefar west and accordingly
the name of slim malone grew old
in the region of appleton and yet the
owner of the name was still young

  appleton was somewhat of a misnomer
for the region had never known anything
save imported apples or any other sort of
fruit since the time of its birth into the
history of whisky and revolvers but a
misguided pioneer in the old days had
raised a few scrubby trees and had named
the town forever the dreams of the early
agriculturalists had died long ago but the

name remained to pique the curiosity of
travelers and furnish jokes for inhabitants

  the town lay at the conjunction of three
gorges in the heart of the rockies and the
little plain where it nestled was crowded
with orchards which bore everything but
apples the six original trees which had
given the town its name now stood in the
back yard of sandy ortons saloon-old
trees with knotted and mossy limbs which
suggested a venerable age due to the hard
climate rather than to the passage of years
they were pointed out to casual travelers
with great pride and they were the estab-
the laughter of slim malone



lished toast of sandys place but sandys
was frequented by a loud-voiced and
spendthrift crowd not usual to agricultural
towns

  in the old days when appleton was a
name rather than a fact the hilarity had
been as absent as the men but after gold
was discovered in the three gorges which
led from the settlement into the heart of
the mountains the little town became a
rendezvous of a thousand adventurers
the stages to and from the railroad thirty
miles away were crowded with men eager
to face the hardships of the climate and
the great adventure of the gold-fields

  it was then that slim malone appeared
it was said that he had first come upon
the scene as the owner of the red river
strike which was finally owned by sandy
gleason it was further rumored that
sandy had beaten slim malone out of the
claim by a very shady deal at cards but
sandy refused to discuss the matter and
slim malone was rarely within vocal range
so the matter had never been sifted
sandy was rarely more vocal than a grunt
and when slim malone appeared people
had generally other things to think about
than questions concerning his past

  a certain percentage of lawlessness is
taken for granted in a mining town peo-
ple are too busy with their own concerns
to pay attention to their neighbors but
when three stages in succession passing
from appleton to concord the nearest
railroad station were robbed by a rider on
a white horse the community awoke and
waxed wrath the loss was too much in
common to be passed over

  the first effort was an impromptu or-
ganization of half a dozen angered miners
who rode into the weston hills they
found fresh hoof-prints after an hour of
riding and went on greatly encouraged
with the pistols loosened in their holsters
after some hours of hard travel they came
upon a white horse in the midst of a hol-
low and then spread into a circle and ap-
proached cautiously but not cautiously
enough while they were still far from
the white horse the bandit opened fire
upon them from the shelter of a circle of
rocks they rode into town the next day

with three of their number badly hurt and
the other three marked for life that
started the war

  as the months passed posse after posse
left appleton and started to scour the wes-
ton hills for the marauder the luckiest
of the expeditions came back telling tales
of a sudden fusillade from an unexpected
covert and then a swift white horse scour-
ing into the distance the majority came
back with no tales at all save of silent
mountains and the grim cactus of the
desert	t 

  in the mean time the stages from apple-
ton to concord were held up with a mo-
notonous regularity by a rider of a fleet
white horse and the mining town grew
more and more irate men cursed the
name of slim malone an adventurous
singer in one of appletons dance halls in-
vented a song featuring the marauder and
it was taken up by the matrons of the
town as a sort of scare-crow ballade to
hush their children

  then the new mayor came to appleton
he owned three claims on askwarthy
gulch and he ran on the double platform
of no license for the appleton saloons and
the end of slim malone the women used
their influence because of the first clause
in his platform and the men voted for him
because of the second his name was or-
val kendricks but that didnt count
what mattered was his red hair and the
statements of his platform slim malone
celebrated the new reign of holding up two
stages within the first five days

  but the new mayor lived up to the color
of his hair and proved worthy of his plat-
form he held a meeting of every able-
bodied citizen in town three days after his
inauguration and in his speech the men
noted with relief that he forgot to men-
tion the saloons and that he concentrated
his attention on slim malone he stated
that the good name and the prosperity of
appleton depended upon the capture of
this marauder at once divorced from the
mayors rather sounding rhetoric the pop-
ulace of appleton realized the truth of his
remarks and applauded him to the echo
his silences were as much appreciated as
his words

  after a carefully prepared peroration he
built up to his climax by the proposal that
the community import  lefty  cornwall
at a salary of five hundred dollars a month
and five thousand bonus to act as deputy
sheriff until the apprehension of slim ma-
lone then the crowd applauded to the
echo in their midst were men who had
lost more than five thousand at a blow
owing to the strenuous activity of this slim
malone they were equal to any mea-
sures for his suppression even if it meant
the importation of lefty cornwall

  the fame of lefty had begun in texas
when he mortally wounded one greaser and
crippled two others in a saloon fight
since then it had increased and spread
until he was a household word even farther
north than appleton he came from that
sun-burned southland where a mans prow-
ess was gaged by his speed and dexterity
with his  irons and even on that north-
ern plateau of appleton men knew that to
cross lefty cornwall was death or mur-
derous mutilation

  at first there were some dissenters
men stated freely that lefty would never
dream of coming as far north as appleton
for a paltry five thousand dollars there
were even a few dissenters who claimed
that even should he come he would never
be able to cope with slim malone but
these were laughed and hooted down by a
radical minority who came from the south-
land and knew the fame of lefty cornwall
in detail the sheriff accounted for the
others by stating that he had already com-
municated with lefty and had received
his assent by letter this announcement
dissolved the meeting in cheers

  appleton decreed the day of the arrival
of the new sheriff a festival occasion the
farmers from the adjoining table-land drove
into town the miners from the three val-
leys rode down and when the stage ar-
rived from concord the incipient sheriff
dismounted in the midst of a huge crowd
and cheers which shook the sign-board of
sandy ortons saloon

  now the mayor of appleton had de-
clared deathless war against the saloons in
his platform but since his election he had
been strangely silent upon the liquor ques-

tion he was as canny as his red hair
suggested and he had a truly scotch in-
sight into the crucial moments of life he
perceived the arrival of lefty cornwall to
be such a moment and he perceived at the
same moment the correct way of meeting
that crisis

  it was with surprise no less than pleas-
ure that the throng heard the lusty voice
of their chief official inviting them to
sandy ortons saloon and where they
were in doubt his beckoning arm put them
right they filled the saloon from bar to
door and those who could not enter
thronged at the entrances with gaping
mouths

  the sheriff was equal to the occasion
he mounted the bar much as a plainsman
mounts a horse and standing in full view
of his fellow citizens he invited lefty
cornwall to join him in his prominent po-
sition nowise loath lefty swung onto
the bar in the most approved fashion and
stood locked arm in arm with the dignified
official of appleton in the mean time the
bartenders thrilled equally with surprise
and pleasure passed out the drinks to the
crowded room it was apparently a mo-
ment big in portent to appleton and not
a heart there but pulsed big with pride in
their mayor

   fellow citizens began the mayor
raising a large freckled hand for silence

  a hush fell upon the assemblage

   boys continued the mayor after a
proper silence reigned  i havent got
much to say

   heres to you  yelled a voice  i hate
a guy thats noisy

  the mayor frowned and waved a com-
manding hand for silence

    spotted you pete bartlett he called
 if you dont like silence you must hate
yourself

  the crowd roared with approving laugh-
ter

   boys began orval kendricks again
when the laughter had subsided  this here
is a solemn occasion i feel called upon
to summon the manhood of this here town
to listen to my words and i reckon that
most of the manhood of the town is within
hearin
the laughter of slim malone



  a chorus of assent followed

   i dont need any daniel webster to
tell you men that this here town is hard
hit continued  mayor kendricks it
dont need no hepry clay to tell you that
these diggins are about to bust up unless
we have the right sort of a strong arm man
in town weve been sufferin patiently
from the aggressions of a red-handed des-
perado who i dont need to mention be-
cause his name just naturally burns my
tongue

  slim malone cried a dozen voices
were followin you chief

  the mayor thrust his hand into his
breast and extended the other arm in imi-
tation of a popular wood-cut of patrick
henry the crowd acknowledged the elo-
quence of the attitude with a common gap-
ing

   there may be some of you guys
cried the mayor rising to the emotion of
the moment  there may be some of you
guys who dont know the man i mean but
i reckon that a tolerable pile of appletons
best citizens spend a large part of their
time cursing slim malone

   we aint through damning him yet
yelled a voice and the crowd voiced their
assent half in growls and half in laughter

   he has tricked our posse as an honest
man would be ashamed to do went on
the mayor warming to his oration  he
has shot our citizens and he has swiped
our gold im askin you as man to man
can a self-respectin community stand for
this it cant whats the answer that
appleton makes to this desperado

  he paused and frowned the audience
into a state of suspense

   there is only one answer to this gun-
fighter and that answer stands at my right
hand bellowed the mayor when he
judged that the silence had sunk into his
hearers sufficiently  the name of the
answer is lefty cornwall

  the following burst of applause brought
a momentary blush into even leftys
cheek at the reiterated demands for a
speech he hitched at his revolver in its
skeleton holster removed his sombrero
and mopped his forehead with a ponderous
hand when it became evident that the

hero was about to break into utterance the
crowd became silent

   fellows began the gun-fighter
 makin speeches aint much in my line

   makin dead men is more your game
broke in the wit of the assemblage

  a universal hiss attested that the crowd
was anxious to hear the texan gun-man
out

   but if you are goin to do me the
honor of makin me sheriff of this here
county and this here city of appleton he
continued letting his eye rove down ap-
pletons one street  im here to state that
law and order is goin to be maintained
here at all costs right here i got to state
that the only costs im referrin to is the
price of the powder and lead for this here
cannon of mine

  the crowd broke in upon the speech
with noisy appreciation and many cries
of thats the stuff old boy

   i been hearin a tolerable pile about
one slim malone went on the new sheriff

   so have we broke in the irrepressible
wit of the assemblage only to be choked
into silence by more serious-minded neigh-
bors

   sure agreed the sheriff  i reckon
youve heard a lot too much about him
but im here to state that all this talk
about slim malone has got to stop and
has got to stop sudden im here to stop
it

  he hitched his holster a little forward
again as he spoke and a deep silence fell
upon the crowd

   fellow citizens he continued spit-
ting liberally over the side of the bar
 whatever gun-play is carried on around
here in the future is to be done strictly by
me and all you men can consider your-
selves under warning to leave your shoot-
in-irons at home unless you want to use
them to dig premature graves

  this advice was received with an ironi-
cal chuckle of appreciation from the crowd

   as for slim malone he went on
 im goin out into the weston hills to
get him single handed i dont want no
posse ill get him single handed or bust
you can lay to that and if i come back
to this town without slim malone alive or


all-story weekly

dead you can say that malone has the
indian sign on me

  having finished all that he had to say
lefty felt about in his mind to find a
graceful manner of closing his exordium
when the mayor came to his assistance
he recognized that nervous clearing of the
throat and wandering of the eyes out of
his own first political experiences now
he raised his glass of colored alcohol and
water which in appleton rejoiced in the
name of bourbon

   boys he shouted  there aint no
better way of showin our appreciation of
our new sheriff than by turnin bottoms
up lets go

  every hand in the barroom flashed into
the air and after a loud whoop there was
a brief gurgling sound which warmed the
heart of sandy orton

  it should have been the signal for a
days carousal and the good citizens of
appleton were no wise averse they de-
sired to hear the voice of their new sheriff
in friendly converse they desired to see
him in that most amiable of all poses his
foot on the rail and his hand on the bar
they wanted to look him over and size him
up just as a boy wishes to fondle his first
gun but the sheriff objected he was
sorry to spoil the fun he said that they
could go ahead and have their little time
but that they must leave him out he
had business to perform that didnt admit
of drinking

  there might have been adverse criticism
of this spartan strenuousness but at this
point a diversion occurred in the shape of
four wild riders who broke into appleton
and brought the word that slim malone
had been out again this time he had held
up a mule train on its way to carry pro-
visions up bender canon to earl parrishs
claim with his usual fine restraint slim
had taken no lives- but he had winged two
of the drivers badly and had helped him-
self from the provisions without unneces-
sary waste he had even lingered to give
first aid to the two drivers whose courage
had overcome their sense of proportion

  if anything had been needed to spur on
the new official of appleton it came in the
form of the message which slim malone

had left with the wounded man before he
rode away

   tell the new sheriff he called as he
sat easily in the saddle  that ive heard
of him and that ill organize a little party
for him as soon as possible so that we can
get better acquainted tell him that the
one thing he lacks to make him a good
fighting man is a sense of humor

  lefty cornwall heard this message in
silence the while he spat with vicious pre-
cision into a distant spittoon afterward
and still in silence he retired and worked
for an hour cleaning his already shining re-
volver and patting and oiling the holster
he performed these grave functions in the
house of the mayor and that dignitary
announced later that he had wound up by
practising the draw and point walking and
sitting down and at every angle the
mayor was impressed past speech

  when lefty issued at last he found a
score of hard riders standing by their
horses in the street

   an what might all this here gang be
for inquired lefty mildly

   were the posse waitin to be sworn
in announced one of the men

   swearin in takes a terrible lot of
time said lefty  an besides i dont
know how its done i dont want no posse
as i said before i wouldnt know how to
handle it anyway twenty men on horse-
back make enough noise to scare away a
whole gang of bandits you might as well
start lookin for trouble with a brass band
because youd sure find the trouble

  he hitched at his belt in his customary
manner when at a loss for words and his
right hand dropped gracefully upon the
handle of his gun and drooped thereon
somewhat sinisterly

   thishere malone went on the sher-
iff  may be a tolerable bad man in his
way but i aint no shorn lamb myself
im goin out to get him an im goin to
get him by myself  reckon thats final
they accepted his announcement with
cheers and set about offering all the in-
formation in their power it was generally
believed that the bandit lived somewhere
at the far end of eagle head canon about
fifteen miles from the town his dwelling
the laughter of slim malone



had never been spotted but he was most
frequently seen riding to and from this
place thrice posses had raked the canon
as with a fine-toothed comb but they had
never come upon a trace of his habitation
but the canon was thick with caves and
heaped with giant boulders which offered
innumerable places of concealment and
the legend was strong that slim malone
lived in that place

  the next thing was to find a proper
mount this proved a more difficult task
the sheriff knew horse- rom nose to hoof
and he was hard to please at last he se-
lected a tall roan with a wicked eye and
fiat shoulders which promised speed
these preparations made he swung to the
saddle waved his hand to the crowd and
galloped out of town

  there was not much bluff about lefty
cornwall as the curious-minded had fre-
quently discovered in the past but as he
swung into the narrow throat of eagle
head canon he began to realize that he
might have gone too far while he was in
the town it had been easy enough to make
ringing speeches now that the evening
began to come down by lazy cool degrees
a certain diffidence grew in him

  he had fought many men during his
brief life but he had never come across a
reputation as strange or as fascinating as
this of slim malone if the challenge
which the bandit had sent him was irrita-
ting it also roused in his mind a certain
degree of respect and as he rode up the
canon winding slowly among the boulders
a hundred doubts infested his mind

  if he had been back upon the level
reaches of the texan desert which he
knew these uncertainties would probably
have never entered his head but here every
half mile of his journey was passed under
the eye of a thousand coverts from which
a man could have picked him off with the
safety of a hunter firing from a blind at
partridges moreover a curious loneliness
akin to homesickness came in him located
as far as he could discover chiefly in the
pit of the stomach

  the mountains were blue now and pur-
ple along their upper reaches and as the
sun left off the moon took up her reign

over the chill blue spaces it was very
solemn almost funereal to the thought of
lefty cornwall and the silence was
punctuated with the melancholy howling
of a far-off coyote

  it was complete night before he reached
the upper end of eagle head canon and
he was weary from the stumbling gait of
his horse over the rocks moreover the
mountain night air was cold-very cold to
lefty he wanted desperately to turn
back but he had not the heart to face the
inquiries which would meet him at the
town and the covert smiles which wouid
welcome the hero returning empty handed
the man who needed no posse

  lefty was a very brave man but like
almost all of the physically courageous he
dreaded derision more than actual pain
yet in spite of this he finally decided that
it was better to go back to the town and
face the smiles than to remain through the
cold night in these dread silences he
wished heartily that he had taken one
other man with him if it were only for the
companionship as it was he felt that it
was no use to hunt further and he started
back down the canon he had not gone
far when his horse stumbled and com-
menced to limp

  lefty got off with a curse and felt of
the fore hoofs the difficulty proved to
be a sharp three-cornered rock which had
been picked up under the shoe of the left
fore foot he was bending over to pry
this loose between his fingers when he
caught the glint of a light

  in his excitement he sprang upright and
stared at once the light disappeared
lefty began to feel ghostly his senses
had never played him such tricks before

  he leaned over and commenced work on
the stone again but as he did so his eye
caught the same glint of light there was
no possible mistake about it this time he
remained bent over and stared at it until
he was certain that he saw a yellow spot
of light a long thin ray which pointedout
to him like a finger through the shadows

  this time he took the bearings of the
light carefully and when he stood up he
was able to locate it again leftys heart
beat high


all-story weekly

  he threw the reins over his horses head
and commenced to stalk the light carefully
sometimes as he slippedand stumbled over
the rocks he lost sight of it altogether only
to have it reappear when he had almost
given up hopes of finding it again and
so he came upon the cave

  the light shone through a little chink
between two tall boulders and as lefty
pressed his eye to the aperture holding his
breath as he did so he saw a long dug-out
perhaps a dozen paces from end to end
and some five paces wide behind a parti-
tion at one end he heard the stamping of
a horse and as lefty gazed a magnificent
white head rose behind the partition and
looked fairly at him his heart stopped
as that great-eyed gaze turned on him the
ears pricking and the wisp of hay motion-
less in the mouth but after a moment
the horse dropped his head again and went
on crunching his fodder stamping now and
then and snorting as he ate

  at first he saw no other occupant of the
place but by moving his eye to one side
of the aperture he managed to get a
glimpse of the bandit himself there was
no question about his identity from the
descriptions which he had heard while in
appleton he knew him at once the ex-
pressionless gray eyes and the thin re-
fined face with an almost greek modeling
about its lower part

  he sat tilted back in a heavy chair
smoking a pipe and reading and lefty
saw that he sat facing a blanket at the far
end of the room evidently this was the
entrance so far as lefty could see the
bandit was unarmed his two long guns
lying on the table half a dozen paces away

  very softly he crept along the side of
the boulder and finally came to an aper-
ture as he had expected it was just wide
enough for a man to press through and
from the chisel marks at his sides it had
evidently been artificially widened from
time to time at the end of the narrow
passage hung the blanket

  if lefty had proceeded cautiously up to
this point his caution now became almost
animal-like behind that blanket he had
no idea what was happening perhaps the
bandit had heard a noise long before and

was now crouched against the wall in an-
other part of the place ready to open fire
at the first stir of the blanket perhaps
he had stolen out of the cave by another
entrance and was now hunting the hunter
the thought sent a chill down leftys back
and he turned his head quickly then he
resumed his slow progress at the very
edge of the blanket he paused for a long
and deathly minute -but lefty was not a
woman to fail at the last moment

  he swung the blanket aside and
crouched in the entrance with his gun lev-
eled the little round sight framed the
face of slim malone who still sat reading
quietly and puffing at a black-bowled pipe

   hands up said lefty softly

  even then with his bead on his man
he did not feel entirely sure of himself it
seemed that this could not be true op-
portunity had favored him too much
there must still be some turn of the game

  the meaningless gray eyes raised calmly
from the book it seemed to lefty that a
yellow glint came into them for a moment
like the light that comes into an animals
eyes when it is angered but the next mo-
ment it was gone and he could not be sure
that it had come there at all the rest of
the face was perfectly calm malone low-
ered the book slowly and then raised his
hands above his head

   ah sheriff he said quietly  i see
that you have honored my invitation

   right-o said lefty  im here all
right

  he felt strangely relieved after hearing
his quarry speak he stepped through the
entrance and straightened up still with the
revolver leveled it was beyond his fond-
est hopes that he should be able to bring
the desperado alive to appleton and the
thought of his complete success warmed his
heart also-the immediate prospect of that
five-thousand-dollar bonus

   in order to remove any strain you may
be under went on slim malone  ill as-
sure you that i am quite unarmed my
guns are both lying on the table there in
order that you may make sure i shall
stand up with my hands over my head
and turn around slowly you can examine
me to your own satisfaction
the laughter of slim malone



    he did as he had said and leftys prac-
  tised eyes saw that there was not the sus-
  picion of a lump under the clothes

     now said slim malone as he faced
  his captor again and his smile was strange-
  ly winning  i hope that i may lower my
  arms and we can commence our little
  party

      your end of this here party is all over
  my beauty said lefty grimly  except
  that the boys at appleton may give you a
  little impromptu reception when we hit
  town they seem to be rather strong on
  celebrations

     so i understand smiled slim ma-
  lone  i have no doubt they will be glad
  to see me

     aint no doubt in the world grinned
  lefty warming to the perfect calm of this
  man  between you an me pal im
  sorry to have to turn this little trick
  but-

    malone waved a careless and reassuring
  hand

     business is business my dear fellow
  he said

      that bein the case said leftv  ill
  have to ask you to turn around and put
  your hands behind your back while i put
   these here bracelets on i dont want to
  discourage you any but while im doin it
  this here gun will be in my hand and point-
  in at your back

    naturally nodded malone quite
  right of course but before we start on our
  little jaunt back to the camp wont you
  have a drink with me i have some really
  rare old stuff here quite different from the
  firewater they put labels on in appleton

    lefty grinned appreciatively

     its a good move pal he said shak-
  ing his head with admiration  an i know
  that youre hard put to it or you wouldnt
  try such an old dodge on me its a good
  move but down in texas the booze stunt
  is so old that theyve almost forgotten it-
  not quite

      ah said malone with a little sigh of
  regret  then i suppose we shall have to
  ride out in the night without a nip gets
  mighty chilly here before morning you
  know

    this fact had gradually dawned on

lefty during his ride up the valley and as
he looked forward to the journey back he
shivered with unpleasant anticipation in
texas a summer night was one thing in
these mountains it was quite another

   i suppose the booze is the real thing
he inquired casually

   there are little bubbles under the
glass said slim malone with subtle emo-
tion

  lefty cornwall sighed deeply the
taste of the appleton bar whisky still
burned his mouth after all this fellow
was a man he might be a criminal but
leftys own past was not free from shady
episodes furthermore he was about -to
make five thousand dollars on presenting
him to the good people of appleton

   if you sure want a drink before we
start go ahead said lefty

   the bottle and a glass is over there in
that little dugout on the wall pointed
malone

  in the little open hutch on the wall the
sheriff perceived a tall bottle which shim-
mered pleasantly in the torch-light

   go ahead said the sheriff  i reckon
you know im watchin all the time

   surely said malone pleasantly  i
know youre on your job all the time

  he walked over to the hutch and picked
up the bottle and the glass he paused
with the bottle tucked away under his arm

   queer thing pondered malone  the
same pack that held this bottle of whisky
held this also

  lefty tightened his grip on the gun as
malone reached deeper into the hutch but
he starightened again and appeared carry-
ing a large concert banjo

   that fellow had taste he continued
crossing the room and laying down the
banjo carelessly on the chair  just run
your eyes over that banjo

   some banjo all right said the sheriff
 but hurry up with your drink malone
weve got to be on our way

  malone uncorked the bottle and held it
under his nose while he inhaled a whiff

   the old aroma all right he pro-
nounced with the air of a connoisseur
 must be a vintage as far back as the
eighties you wont join me


all-story weekly

  now the heart of the sheriff was a hu-
man heart but his will was adamant

   not me malone he answered  ive
been in the game too long cant drink
on this sort of a job

   guess youre right murmured ma-
lone letting the amber stream trickle slow-
ly into the glass  but its too bad

  he raised the glass to his lips and swal-
lowed half of the contents slowly

   the stuff is so oily he mused  that
you dont need a chaser just sort of oils
its own way down you know

  the sheriff moistened his lips

   it certainly is a shame that you cant
taste it continued malone as he drained
the glass

  the sheriff hitched his belt with his cus-
tomary gesture

   it looks like the real thing he said
judicially

   it is pronounced malone with deci-
sion  and after the sort of poison they
serve you around here-

  the sheriff shuddered with sympathy

   i reckon he said hesitatingly  that
you might pour me just a drop

  it seemed to him that as he spoke the
yellow glint came into the eyes of malone
again but a moment later it was gone and
he decided that the change had been mere-
ly a shadow from the wavering torch-light
he took the glass which malone extended
to him under the cover of the pointed gun
and raised it slowly to his lips

   just stand a bit further back while i
drink pal he said

  malone obeyed and the sheriff tilted the
glass it was as malone had said  the
real old aroma and the sheriff drew a deep
breath

  now there is a saying about liquor that
the drink which does the harm is  just
one more and certain it is that one whis-
ky calls for another as surely as a question
calls for an answer

   i reckon it aint quite as old as you
say said the sheriff feeling his way from
word to word cautiously  i reckon it
aint more than fifteen years old at the
outside

  malone paused with the bottle suspend-
ed over the glass to consider

    i thought that myself when i first
drank he nodded  but that was before
i got used to it all bourbon is a little
sharp you know

   the sheriff was inclined to agree he
also felt sure that one more drink would
quite banish from his memory the taste of
that one drink in appleton moreover
the danger if there was any was slight
for malone was taking drink for drink
with him and larger drinks at that it
was a sort of subtle challenge to the man-
hood of the sheriff and he was as proud
of his capacity for whisky as of his speed
with a gun

   it was perhaps half an hour later that
the sheriff indicated the banjo with a care-
less wave of the pistol

    play any he inquired  or do you
keep it around as sort of an ornament
 both smiled malone  it makes
the place more homelike you know and
then i sing once in a while but not often
folks around here arent particularly par-
tial to my voice

   im a pretty good judge stated the
sheriff  blaze away and ill see you aint
interrupted been a long time since i
had the pleasure of hearing any decent
singin

   he was as he said a fairly good judge
 and he was delighted with the rich bary-
 tone which rang through the cave after
 a time as the whisky and the music melt-
 ed into his mood he began to call for old
 favorites darky ballads and last of all
 for the sentimental ditties which have al-
 ways charmed the heart of the rough men
 of the west  annie laurie  old black
 joe  ben bolt  silver threads among
 the gold

   as he sang the bandit commenced natu-
rally to walk back and forth through the
cave and the sheriff sat back in the chair
and with half-closed eyes waved the re-
volver back and forth in time he failed
to note that as malone walked up and
down each time he made a longer trip
until at last he was pacing and turning
close to the table on which lay the revolv-
ers side by side he did not note it or if
he did his mind was too thrilled with the
tender airs and the tenderer liquor to reg-
the laughter of slim malone



 ister the fact clearly it faded into the
 pleasant -blur of his sensations

fi oh dont you remember sweet alice ben bolt
  sweet alice with-

 the music stopped malone had
stooped over the table with the speed of a
bird picking up a grain of wheat and with
the same movement he whirled and fired
the gun spun from the hand of the sheriff
and he stood staring into eyes which now
beyond all doubt flared with a yellow ani-
mal fire

   now put your hands behind your back
after youve thrown those bracelets to
me said malone  i naturally hate to
break up this party but i think youve
had about enough whisky to keep you
warm on the ride back lefty my boy

  there was an insane desire on the sher-
iffs part to leap upon malone bare-handed
but he had seen too many fighting men in
action before he knew the meaning of
those eyes and the steadiness of the re-
volver

   its your game slim he said with as
little bitterness as possible  but will you
tell me why in the name of god you arent
on the stage it isnt what you do pal
its the way you do it

  appleton woke early the next morning
some one shouted and then fired a pistol
the populace gathered at windows and
doors rubbing sleepy eyes which a moment
later shone wide awake and yawns turned
into yells of laughter for down the middle
of appletons one street came the sheriff
he was sitting the roan horse with his feet
tied below the girth and his hands tied
behind his back and even the weary roan
seemed to feel in his drooping head the de-
feat of his rider

  upon the back of the sheriff was a large
piece of cardboard upon which was print-
ed in large letters the following

  im sending this back with my signature in
token of a pleasant evening in my home in eagle
head canon im sorry to announce that im
moved	slim malone

 the hawthorne vase

new york had a new musical sensa-
tion - senorita dolores arsenjo
those who had heard her play de-
clared she was the greatest violinist in the
world this was a rather daring claim
certainly the partizans of elman of heifetz
would not have admitted it for a moment

a woman-a mere girl-outplay the recog-
nized artists of the day absurd

   why doesnt this senorita dolores ar-
senjo play in public so the public may
judge asked the skeptics

  but that is exactly what the senorita had
never done-at least in new york she
played only in the homes of the very rich-
and then for never less than three thousand
dollars a program people said her fathfer
senor jose arsenjo explained it thus in
his startling good english

   my daughter is very sensitive there
are too many cross currents of magnetism
in a public audience their jangling in-
harmonies make it impossible for her to do
herself-or the composers-justice she
tried it once at buenos aires andagain at
rio de janeiro-we carried her from the
stage in a dead faint each time money
senorita arsenjo does not play in the homes
of multimillionaires primarily for the
money it is only in such homes we can
find the proper scenic investiture for i
contend that the musician as well as the
actor should have a perfect stage setting
owen vaughn who was frankly curious



to hear senorita arsenjo play was pleasant-
ly surprised to receive an invitation to a
recital to be given by her in an exclusive
mansion on riverside drive while vaughn
was a well-known private detective he was
not of sufficient social importance to have
drawn such an invitation on his own ac-
count for it he had to thank his friend
and coworker margot dale

  this young woman an uncommonly clev-
er one followed her chosen profession of
sleuth in the higher circles of new york
society she had had signal success in sev-
eral sensational jewel robberies and per-
sonally had become a favorite with certain
members of the smart set who had cause
to be grateful for delicate services rendered
one of these was mrs john bashford
whymper wife of john bashford whym-
per capitatlist mrs whymper was giving
the musicale and had graciously invited
margot and extended the privilege of bring-
ing a friend

   its really a wonderful bid owen said
margot when you remember senor ar-
senjo rigidly limits the number of people at
his daughters recitals mrs whymper
says the senorita is miraculous-super-
human-hypnotizing you till you lose all
sense of your surroundings fancying your-
self in paradise that sounds extravagant
but mrs whymper insists it isnt unusual
for senorita arsenjos hearers to be so over-
come they have to be worked over and
brought back to consciousness just like peo-
ple in a dead faint

   uncanny commented vaughn  im
the head of arsenjo



more curious than ever to hear this prodigy
play and ill keep my eyes open as well
as my ears

   why your eyes you dont think
theres any trick about it

   trick he laughed  how could there
be

  on the night of the recital vaughn and
margot arrived at the magnificent whym-
per palace rather early mrs whymper
an enormous woman in red charmeuse re-
ceived them in one of the smaller reception-
rooms and they were immediately con-
ducted up-stairs into the music-room where
senorita arsen jo was to play this was a
large double-storied apartment done in
gilded columns and gobelin tapestries one
end had been reserved for the young violin-
ist the grand piano was already open
and several sheets of music were on the
music-rack senorita arsenjos music-stand
stood near

  the program announced an  evening of
russian music and vaughn recalling
sefior arsenjos insistence on  atmos-
phere glanced around to see if any at-
tempt had been made at a fitting scenic in-
vestiture directly behind the piano hung
an odd old russian tapestry showing one
of the czars blessing the neva near by
stood a rather battered samovar and rus-
sian brass-ware was scattered about in more
or less picturesque confusion and these
trumpery objects constituted the atmos-
phere without which senor arsenjo de-
clared his daughter could not play the
thing was ridiculous

  in casting his quick eye about the room
vaughn was surprised to discover back of
the chairs a superb objet dart that was
most emphatically not in harmony with the
various russian articles near the piano it
was a large tall black hawthorn vase of
the kang-hsi period an incomparable speci-
men of its kind why had it been put
here there was certainly nothing slavic
about it

  vaughn charmed by its beauty suddenly
recognized it as one that had belonged to
a deceased client of his mr wilmerding
jackson from whom it had been stolen
the detective had been employed on the
case and had found it in a down-town an-

     a-s

tique shop on his clients death-which
had occurred only a few weeks before-the
vase among other valued possessions of the
deceased had been sold at auction to john
bashford whymper bringing the record
price of twenty-four thousand dollars

  vaughn turned to margot to call her at-
tention to this masterpiece he found her
in gay conversation with a handsome virile-
looking young fellow in khaki whom she in-
troduced as lieutenant bateson u s a
the two gentlemen barely had time to shake
hands when a short powerfully built man
his broad shoulders crowned with an ab-
normally large head covered with masses
of snowy hair entered the room through
a small doorway near the piano

  senor arsenjo whispered margot
isnt he wonderful

  senor arsenjo was bringing in some
music-books which he placed on the piano
vaughn looked at him with eager interest
the most noticeable thing about him was
his head it was a remarkable head not
only for size but for perfect proportions
it would have been an extraordinary head
even without the white hair with that
snowy aureole it was a model for an artist
he changed the position of some of the
atmosphere flashed a glance over the room
which was filling rapidly then quietly dis-
appeared

  vaughn turned toward his companions
again lieutenant bateson was telling mar-
got how he had disappointed his mother in
not following the career for which he had
been educated-that of concert pianist

   she had her heart set on it he said
 and it was too bad i had such a mind of
my own when i was a little tot i played
the piano like a prodigy everybody said
that put the idea into mothers head at
the age of seven i was practising five and
six hours a day and later of course came
the inevitable four years abroad i returned
home gave my recital in carnegie hall
and didnt do so badly my mother was
delighted

   but i had decided the life of a piano-
virtuoso was not for me  its all very well
for russians and foreigners generally i told
her  they have the unpronounceable
names the long hair and the temperament


all-story weekly

i	havent id rather be on a wyoming
cattle-ranch this very minute so i en-
listed in the army instead of wasting my
time lolling over the keyboard i-

  his speech was cut short by the sudden
entrance of a beautiful blonde very young
very petite fair beyond comparison with a
wealth of hair as yellow as arsenjos was
white and big blue eyes

  senorita arsenjo exclaimed margot
softly  isnt she a dream but how little
like a spaniard she looks-

  by jove yes whispered lieutenant
bateson flushing at sight of this supernal
vision  one would swear shes american
-or at lease english

  the senorita was followed by her father
and a small dark-eyed woman who took
her seat at the piano and ran her fingers
over the keys arsenjo went across to a
large stiff-backed chair sat down leaned
back and gazed dreamily into space

   hes not going to hypnotize her at any
rate murmured vaughn smilingly  i
was wondering if we were to be treated to
a trilby-svengali performance

  the young girl wholly disregarding the
sheet-music on the stand took her posi-
tion in front of it and bowed graciously to
the audience the dark-eved women at the
piano began the prelude to rubensteins
 at the window and in a moment the
round rich tones of the violin deep and
sonorous as a cellos filled the room

  at the sounds lieutenant bateson sprang
a new enthusiasm  a real stradivarius and
thefinest ive ever heard he whispered to
margot  no wonder she is such a success
that violin-with her beauty-is enough to
carry her through

when the senorita had finished playing
the piece margot turned to vaughn
 well owen what do you think of her
 dozens just as good play at carnegie
hall ever season

  she next asked batesons opinion

   greater than elman ysaye any o
them 

  vaughn smiled at this outburst the
young soldier was falling precipitately in
love there was no mistaking it

  senorita arsenjo played a few more num-
bers all of them slavic throughout the

program her father had sat motionless in
the stiff-backed chair his eyes gazing ab-
stractedly into space vaughn watched him
closely but not once had he seen him
glance at his daughter much less try to
meet her gaze and hold it hypnotically so
far he had seemed to be a superfluity-
though a rather decorative one with that
splendid head of his the detective had to
admit

  at length the last number on the program
was reached and sefior arsenjo rose sud-
denly bowed and said in his perfect en-
glish

   ladies and gentlemen my daughter
thanks you for your very kind appreciation
she will now play the  tropical lullaby
composed by myself in honor of our beloved
native land ecuador the lullaby is an
indian song an indian mother one of
the quinchua aborigines of the country is
singing her child to sleep as you listen try
to envision a mud-walled hut in the shadow
ot mount chimborazo the indian mother
is sitting outside her door her baby in her
arms

  he bowed and left the room the ac-
companist followed him senorita arsenjo
was to play alone she smiled charmingly
then gracefully inclining her pretty head at
an outburst of applause began

   vaughn a bit excited despite his skeptic-
ism braced himself against whatever was
to come he knew the beautiful young
violinist made her greatest appeal with the
sort of music she was about to play the
first notes of the  tropical lullaby  were
strangely suggestive of the hot and humid
languor of the equator and he felt himself
succumbing to their spell miragelike there
appeared before him the huge bulk of chim-
borazo at its base the mud-walled hut
sprang into being like trick stage scenery
and there by the door sat the indian mother
crooning her song

  steeped in the melody vaughn glanced
sleepily toward margot and lieutenant
bateson they seemed like figures in a
dream oddly far off small scarcely alive
suddenly they faded dissolved into noth-
ingness the entire audience became blotted
out even the senoritas slender swaying
figure grew blurred then vanished alto-
the head of arsenjo



gether and vaughn dominated as though
by some irresistible hypnosis had the curi-
ous sensation of rising as if on wings into
the air

  suddenly there was a loud crash near
that roused him sharply from his dream the
noise seemed to bring everybody else back
to consciousness also in a moment dozens
of lips were asking the startled question
 what is it

  vaughn thoroughly awake glanced
around and found the hawthorn vase-the
twenty - four - thousand - dollar specimen-
shattered on the floor the next instant
there was a shrill cry and mrs whymper
forgetting everything else in her grief over
the catastrophe-forgetting even her dignity
as hostess-rushed to the vase picked up
one of the fragments and burst into hysteri-
cal tears

   my dearest possession i wouldnt have
parted with it for twice what i paid for it
oh who could have done this

  with majestic dignity senor arsenjo re-
entered the room vaughn who was using
his eyes sharply noted the fact that the
senorita had disappeared-though her vio-
lin lay on the piano and the music-stand had
not been removed

  one of the ladies perhaps the most ex-
cited of the company with the sole exception
of mrs whymper herself sprang up at
sight of the senor and rushed toward him

   oh senor just look at mrs whympers
pet vase that priceless hawthorn lying
tragically shattered on the floor now none
of us knocked it over of course do you
think it could have been vibrated over so
to speak-precipitated to the floor by the
musical vibrations

  at the absurd query senor arsenjo did
not look disgusted or even smile instead
he not only took the lady seriously but
agreed with her

   i think it quite likely such a thing
happened at one of my daughters recitals
at santiago-a magnificent cloisonne sud-
denly fell to the floor all due to malevolent
sound waves

  a fragment of the vase was lying on the
floor near vaughn he stooped and picked
it up then began examining it

    i dont see how musical vibrations could

knock a heavy thing like my poor kang-hsi
to the floor said mrs whymper with un-
expected good sense  besides why didnt
they knock something else down too-some
of that russian brass-ware for instance
senor arsenjo smiled indulgently  ah
but maybe my dear lady the musical vi-
brations have a special affinity for hawthorn
vases-

  vaughn suddenly went to the shattered
vase and picked up several more of the
pieces his action was so precipitate the
others began watching him curiously

   mrs whvmfer he said after a mo-
ment  this broken vase is not the kang-
hsi it is only a rather poor imitation

   what she gasped-to the accompani-
ment of astonished murmurs from the rest

   i happen to know a good deal about
this particular vase-or rather the one for
which it was substituted he continued
 you will no doubt remember when it was
stolen from the late mr wilmerding jack-
son i was employed to trace it and suc-
ceeded-

   when do you think the substitution
took place she broke in excitedly it
must have been very recently for only
yesterday i had the vase placed here at
senor arsenjos request i was present
when it was brought in

  vaughn sprang his climax the sub-
stitution took place while senorita arsenjo
was playing

  impossible cried a dozen voices
senor arsenjo gave a derisive laugh even
mrs whymper in the mood for miracles
though she was shook her head

   my dear mr vaughn pray dont ask
us to believe that-

   but you must believe it the genuine
kang-hsi had the unmistakable cheng-hua-
mark beneath the foot of the ming dynasty
see this vase has no such mark another
thing-do you remember how heavy the
original one was the fall to the floor
would never have shattered it this vase
is much lighter in weight

  how perfectly astounding gasped
mrs whymper  mr vaughn i put the
case in your hands here and now-if youll
take it you had luck in finding my adored
kang-hsi before maybe you can repeat


all-story weekly

                   it

  as she spoke the small door near the
piano opened and senorita arsenjo followed
by her accompanist entered the room she
looked rather pale and a bit disheveled a
coil or so of her flaxen hair having escaped
from its pins at sight of the shattered
vase and the excited group around it she
stopped short

   what is it she inquired

  her father hurried toward her  noth-
ing that concerns the greatest violinist in
the world he cried grandiloquently then
he added tenderly putting his arm around
her  i want to spare you all the inhar-
monv i can you know how sensitive you
are-

   but-what is it im interested-

  senor arsenjo gently turned her around
so she could not see then he faced mrs
whymper and her guests

   pray excuse senorita arsenjo he said
bowing profoundly  she has just come
out of a dead faint usually she loses con-
sciousness after playing the tropical
lullaby to-night however she fainted
before reaching the last measures and he
led her from the room

   oh my poor strayed stolen kang-
hsi- wailed mrs whymper bursting into
fresh tears  mr vaughn do please get
busy and find it for me

chapter ii

the biakelock sunset

vaughn lost no time in getting to
work on the case

in a few moments mrs whym-
pers guests began leaving the arsenjos
were the first to go vaughn stationed him-
self in the lower hall and with his own eyes
saw that nobody took the vase away of
course being so large and heavy any ordi-
nary person would have been unable to
carry it at all much less surreptitiously
but vaughn who believed in doing things
thoroughly thought it better to satisfy
himself on the point next he made a
search of the house and questioned the ser-
vants but with no result mrs whymper
was still in tears when he and margot said
good night and left

  as for the twin mysteries-the mystery
of the kang-hsis disappearance and the
mystery of the  spell  cast by senorita
arsenjos music-he was certain he had
them solved already but he grimly real-
ized he had a good deal of hard work to
do before he could fix the blame for the
exchange of vases and expose to a gaping
world the modus operandi of the  spell
the next morning he telephoned mrs
whymper happily the lady was accept-
ing her loss more philosophically than on
the night before but her quavering tones
still hinted of tears when she mentioned
her beloved kang-hsi vaughn asked for
the address of senor arsenjo which she
gave with some surprise

   surely youre not connecting them with
the theft she gasped horrified  the
arsenjos of all people

  he laughed why should i listen
mrs whymper i see in the society column
that mrs lorillard foulkes is giving an
arsenjo recital to-morrow night at her home
on fifth avenue youll be there

   yes

   good get me two invitations-one
for miss margot dale the other for me
you can arrange it

   i daresay-though of course she has
her list already made out but why do
you want to go in the interest of the
case

   exactly-but remember im not con-
necting the senor or his charming daughter
with the disappearance of the vase at all
ask mrs foulkes for invitations for your
friends  mr and mrs spencer of chi-
cago miss dale and i will go in dis-
guise-

  in disguise oh mr vaughn you
frighten me-really all this smacks of
some creepy coup or other how  i
know you when i see you

  vaughn chuckled  ill give you the
wink dont be nervous-and dont be
afraid well disgrace you simply shake
hands with us and present us to mrs
foulkes and ill do the rest good-by
the next evening mr and mrs spencer
of chicago a rather picturesque though
thoroughly well-groomed and well-man-
nered couple arrived at mrs lorillard
the head of arsenjo



foulkess palatial fifth avenue town house
early mrs whymper was already there
however and she immediately presented her
 friends  to the hostess a typical grande
dame who received them cordially

  a surprise awaited vaughn and margot
in the music-room to which a flunkey im-
mediately conducted them at first they
thought the huge high dimly lighted apart-
ment was empty but on looking toward
the end where the piano stood they spied
half hidden by a dutch tapestry senorita
arsenjo and lieutenant bateson chatting
confidentially

  what gasped margot hes made
her acquaintance already and theyre talk-
ing like old friends how did he manage
it

  suddenly a white head was thrust into
the room through a doorway near the piano
-the incomparable head of senor jose
arsenjo-and a voice called sharply

   dolores what are you doing

  the young girl gave a confused start
and blushed to the roots of her fair hair
 why just speaking to lieutenant bate-
son father-

   come at once senorita valdez is ill
senorita dolores hesitated gave the
young soldier a naively eloquent look then
ran lightly from the room the look bate-
son flashed after her was even more elo-
quent than hers

 wildly in love commented margot
 headlong fellow i wonder who that
senorita valdez is the senor mentioned-
 the little black-eyed accompanist

   to be sure he said shes ill oh
owen maybe the senorita wont play-

   sh-h stop calling me owen here
comes bateson-

  bateson his face still aglow came toward
them as on the other evening he was
dressed in khaki and margot thought as
she looked at him that any girl-even the
 greatest violinist in the world -might
fall in love with him he was such a hand-
some fellow he gave the spencers only a
passing glance and was about to turn away
when vaughn in cleverly disguised tones
spoke to him

   pardon me have you heard senorita
arsenjo play we-

  lieutenant bateson

  the words came in a girlish voice from
the doorway near the piano the three
turned quickly the speaker was senorita
arsenjo rosy smiling she was alone-
and evidently waiting for the young soldier
to join her she did not have to wait
long bateson was beside her almost at
one stride she whispered to him mysteri-
ously he nodded eagerly and then both dis
appeared through the doorway

  the room was filling with guests vaughn
and margot began taking notes-she of the
people he of the surroundings the setting
for to-nights recital the room was ar-
ranged much as mrs whympers had been
the piano in one remote comer the chairs
quite a distance from it no vases or other
objets dart were anywhere visible but
hanging on a large black velvet curtain be-
hind the rows of chairs was a solitary oil
painting of medium size richly framed in
gold it was a gorgeous sunset done in
boldest orange and vermilion

   ill wager thats a blakelock whis-
pered vaughn  we have something inter-
esting here

  mrs foulkes was standing near mr
spencer of chicago approached her smil-
ingly

   ive just been telling mrs spencer that
that stunning painting is a blakelock he
said  am i right

  people often resist the temptation to
boast of their money but they find it harder
not to boast of what their money brings

   yes indeed thats not only a blake-
lock but it has been picked as quite the
best sunset the artist ever painted its
the celebrated  flare before dusk i paid
twenty thousand dollars for it and the
lady went to other guests

  vaughn sauntered to the picture it was
indeed a blakelock-the nightmare land-
scape the wild coloring were unmistakable
he peered at the lower left corner of the
canvas closely and found the artists char-
acteristic signature

   and mrs foulkes paid twenty thou-
sand dollars for it he said to himself 
must keep my eyes on it while the senorita
plays

  he rejoined margot and they seated


all-story weekly

themselves at the left end of the last row
he turned his chair slightly toward her
and then half faced her in quite a lover-
like fashion

   whats this for she laughed  you
didnt stipulate wed have to make an amor-
ous exhibition of ourselves

  he nodded toward the blakelock she
understood he wanted to be in a position
to flash a glance at the picture every now
and then without turning his head

  senor jose arsenjo the noble-browed
came out just before the recital began and
made an announcement which caused a
murmur of surprise

   ladies and gentlemen he said without
his usual smile-almost with an ugly scowl
in fact  owing to the sudden illness of my
daughters accompanist senorita valdez we
have had to accept the kindly proffered
services of lieutenant bateson who  un-
derstand was a pianist of some note before
he entered upon a military career under
the circumstances you will not  am sure
expect too much in the way of a perfectly
coordinated performance they have just
been practising together a few moments on
the small piano in the drawing-room

  the next moment the senorita entered
followed by bateson who in his khaki
made a picturesque figure his broad smile
and shining eyes betrayed so unmistakably
his boyish delight at being able to assume
this unwonted and distinguished role that
the audience quickly responding to his
frank pleasure beamed with sympathy he
proved himself no mean pianist too he
had a sure touch and he read amazingly
well as for dolores she outdid herself
vaughn had to admit to margot that he
had begun to revise his opinion of her
ability

  when the first part of the program was
finished senorita dolores retired amid en-
thusiastic applause lieutenant bateson es-
corting her out with great gallantry the
senor scowling followed in a few mo-
ments bateson reentered and received the
congratulations of his friends for his musi-
cianlv performance

  the intermission between part i and part

ii	of the program was unusually long but
at last the senor reappeared to make his

little speech it was the same one he had
made at mrs whvmpers he asked the
audience to visualize the indian mother
crooning to her babe senorita dolores
came out and began playing the low rich
notes of the  tropical lullaby her father
waited a moment casting a half-quizzical
glance over the crowd then vanished

  vaughn turned toward margot a trifle
farther so as to be able to keep his gaze
continuously on the blakelock without at-
tracting attention for a time nothing hap-
pened the picture remained hanging on
the black velvet curtain no substitution
was attempted-he was sure of it but
suddenly he experienced an odd haziness of
sensation the floor seemed to shrink from
beneath him margot seemed to be slowly
yet surely withdrawing herself from his
side and in a perverse flash he began
thinking of the indian woman at the foot of
chimborazo at the same moment the
music seemed to be taking on divine har-
monies not of earth

    brace yourself against it he managed
to whisper to her-though already she
seemed half-way across the room

  vigorously he fought the mysterious in-
fluence keeping his eyes on the blakelock
-save when he glanced around to see if
arsenjo had reentered the south ameri-
can was nowhere in sight vaughn feeling
himself succumbing more and more to the
spell was on the point of rebelling against
it physically even to the extent of springing
to his feet and interrupting the recital when
the curious paralysis of nightmare seized
him and he found himself unable to move
he did not lose consciousness-quite but
everything disappeared as on the other eve-
ning and he had the sensation of rising
buoyantly in the air

  when he came to himself margot was
leaning against his shoulder the audience
gasping seemed awakening from some rap-
turous dream the music had ceased
senorita dolores had disappeared so had
her father the blakelock was it still
there yes there it hung-the blakelock
or a perfect copy of it had a spurious
picture been substituted for the original as
in the case of the kang-hsi vase

  vaughn rose and paced casually to the
the head of arsenjo



painting nobody was looking in his direc-
tion save margot he took a small mag-
nifying-glass from his pocket and began ex-
amining certain parts of the canvas-ob-
jects on the landscape and queer cloud ef-
fects that he knew were typical of the artist
if the picture was a copy it was a remark-
ably good one the haphazard technique
seemed blakelocks very own wait-what
was this he had turned the glass on the
painters name in the lower left corner
the lettering resembled that on all the
blakelocks he had seen but a sudden faint
smell of jresh paint roused his suspicions
in a rush he touched the  b  with the
tip of his little finger and discovered that
the paint was indeed wet

   what is it whispered margot at his
elbow

  he laughed grimly  only fresh
paint-

   fresh paint but blakelock painted
this picture years ago-

   not this picture you trustful child
the one that hung here before senorita
arsenjo played the  tropical lullaby  was
painted by blakelock years ago this one
was painted by somebody else much more
recently-maybe within the last few days
but the copyist clever though he was for-
got one very important thing-he forgot
to put blacklocks name on the picture till
to-day-till perhaps even the last hour or
so-which explains the phenomenon of the
fresh paint

   owen gasped margot  youre going
to tell mrs foulkes of course

chapter iii

at dr durants

vaughn waited until all the other
guests were gone and then introduc-
ing himself as owen vaughn the de-
tective briefly told mrs foulkes of the ex-
change of pictures while she was still
gasping with astonishment he secured her
permission to interrogate the footman who
had attended the main door that evening
this man was the typical side-whiskered
bald-headed solemn-visaged english lackey
he answered vaughns questions readily

and seemed to be a rather perceptive care-
fully spoken person

  did any messenger present himself here
to-night after the guests had arrived
yes sir a man with an enormous box
of flowers for senorita arsenjo

   did you take them

   i told the man to give them to me and
i would see that the young lady received
them but he refused he said his orders
were to give them either to her or her father
and to no one else he waited while i
called senor arsenjo

   the senor came

   yes sir

   what happened then

   i dont know senor arsenjo who was
very hurried and excited said that senorita
valdez had fainted and that his daughter
was much upset by it he told me to go
and help administer restoratives while he
attended to the man who had brought the
flowers he seemed angry because the man
had come and as i left i heard him say
he would teach him such a lesson that his
daughter would be free in future from that
kind of annoyance

  you went to the ladies

  yes sir

   where were they

   in the small reception-room off the
music-room

   what happened there

   senorita valdez was lying on the divan
unconscious senorita arsenjo was chafing
her hands and trying in other ways to bring
her out of it i got restoratives but it was
a very stubborn case the lady was quite
a time coming to-ten or fifteen minutes at
least

   who was supposed to tend the door
meanwhile

  the footman looked rather sheepish
 nobody sir to tell you the truth i
forgot all about the door senorita arsenjo
was so excited i grew excited too-im a
bit nervous anyway we were afraid the
other lady might not come out of it-so
we worked very hard when at last she
opened her eyes i hurried back to the
door

   had senor arsenjo returned to the
small reception-room before you left


all-story weekly

   xo sir he was still in the hall with
the man who had brought the flowers the
fellow was about to leave senor arsenjo
was in a towering rage he was almost lit-
erally kicking the poor man out sir  take
these flowers back to the fool who sent
them he was shouting  and tell him if
he ever sends any more ill have him locked
up as a nuisance the man who looked
quite pale from fright left

   he took the box

   yes sir

   what was its shape and size

  it was quite large-about five feet
long four wide and maybe a bit more than
a foot in thickness

   describe the messenger

   short very square powerfully set up
with big bulging shoulders a foreign yel-
lowish-copper face and very black eyes

   thank you thats all

  by this time mrs foulkes had recovered
her composure sufficiently to discuss with
vaughn the mysterious disappearance of the
blakelock he found her in the music-
room with margot and mrs whymper

   xow mr vaughn began the latter
half banteringly please dont drag in the
arsen jos-

   the arsenjos  echoed mrs foulkes
blankly  you dont mean-

   my dear mrs foulkes vaughn inter-
posed  we have no time for exclamatives
perhaps i had better say that to mrs
whymper he added with a dry little
laugh  after i have gone you ladies can
marvel to your hearts content but just now
i want you to answer a few questions
mrs foulkes you told me before the recital
to-night that senor arsenjo asked you to
have the blakelock hung on the curtain
there

   yes he said it would inspire his daugh-
ter he was here this afternoon and super-
intended the hanging of it himself

   you were in the room while it was
being hung

   yes

   how did he happen to hang it on the
black velvet

   first he hung it on the wall but the
frescoing spoiled the picture--at least so he
insisted

   why was the curtain hung several feet
away from the wall instead of on the wall
 it was senor arsenjos idea he said
the wall was too far away from where the
senorita was to stand when she played
he wanted her to see the picture more
distinctly

   h-m-and the small door leading to the
hall is behind the curtain

  mrs foulkes was frankly nonplused
 but granting all this what good did the
door do him how in the world did he
carry the picture out

  vaughn smiled  when did senor ar-
senjo propose hanging the blakelock here
in the music-room

   just after he agreed to give the recital
-i think about a week ago he asked me
to let him see whatever pictures and objets
dart i might have when i told him i
had a blakelock he was all eagerness and
asked to see the picture at once his in-
sistence on atmosphere had always struck
me as being rather far-fetched so i said
 but senor the subject of the picture may
not chime in with your ideas of atmosphere
at all just because its a blakelock that
happens to be worth twenty thousand dol-
lars is no sign it will provide the exact sort
of atmosphere your very temperamental
daughter requires any blakelock will
do he replied  senorita dolores is simply
crazy about blakelocks when i showed
him the picture he was more enthusiastic
than ever  just the thing he cried
 thats a regular ecuador sunset blake-
lock must have been in ecuador-or
dreamed he was there-when he painted
it 

  vaughn studied  do you know when
and where the senorita makes her next pro-
fessional appearance

   the first of next week at dr
durants-

   you mean dr durant the psycho-
logist

   yes hes writing a wonderful book
about the senorita you know

  his eyes lit  i know dr durant
well-

 you mean youll be at the recital-and
in another disguise cried mrs whymper
but he smiled an evasion and in a mo-
the head of arsenjo



ment he and margot bade the ladies a
rather abrupt good night

  the next morning anticipating a strenu-
ous day he reached his office earlier than
usual but early though the hour was he
found michael maguinness mcsurelv a
quick-witted good-humored irishman who
had graduated into his service from the
new york police department waiting for
him mcsurely had ready the report of
his activities of yesterday and last night
on the kang-hsi case it was a wholly
disappointing one he had made a round
of antique dealers certain picked pawn-
shops  fences and a number of private
individuals who dealt in stolen articles of
value behind various more or less effective
kinds of camouflage but he had been un-
able to discover a trace of the missing vase

  and now there was the blakelock to com-
plicate things

   mac said vaughn  youd better go
over the ground again and see if you run
across the picture wait- he reflected
a moment  no that would be a waste of
time the senor is too wily to trust pro-
fessional fences hell keep his booty him-
self until a safe time to dispose of it the
thing for you to do is to take a taxi and
watch the mans house for the day i dont
think hed keep either the kang-hsi or the
blakelock under his own roof he no doubt
takes his stuff to some place where he him-
self is seldom or never seen but he could
hardly have made this particular trip in the
dead of night he must have waited till this
morning somebody in the game-maybe
the foreign-looking fellow who took the fake
flowers to mrs foulkess last night-will
take the picture away this morning
wrapped differently to-where thats
for you to find out mac follow him no
matter where he goes or how long it takes
you

  mac looked up arsenjos address in the
telephone-directory

   the old van loon place away out on
riverside drive he said  big ancient
white pile on the corner in a tangle of old
trees behind a high garden wall therell
be four or five doors to watch all at once-
in that prison wall-but trust me chief to
use my peeps and he was off

  that afternoon vaughn called on his old
friend dr durant marcus aurelius du-
rant who resided in an aristocratic old
house in gramercy park was a rather
unique character a millionaire who had
inherited his money he had lived his life
on the boundary between two worlds de-
voting himself to psychic research and oc-
cult experiment he had evolved a count-
less number of bizarre theories on abstruse
subjects and these had naturally excited
the ridicule of scientific men but nothing
daunted he had written book after book
first on spiritism then on the phenomena
of dreams then on the  sixth sense and
so on until now in the autumn of his years
he was riding a new hobby-the psychic in-
fluence of music

  he had always held vaughn in grateful
esteem for having introduced him to sev-
eral celebrated  psychopathic f criminals
whom he had experimented upon and ex-
ploited in one of his books and now he was
delighted to be able to return the favor by
inviting him to senorita arsenjos recital
which was to take place at his house the
next thursday night

   have you ever heard the beautiful
young senorita play he asked beamingly
yes twice

   is she not a wonder-a phenomenon
 she certainly is i have a theory about
her playing-

   so have i he was precipitate in his
enthusiasm  im writing a book about
her marvelous girl briefly my theory is
this music is god and the human being
who expresses music most perfectly-in
other words who expresses god most per-
fectly-is a savior of the race startling
eh what do you think of it

   very remarkable indeed it will create
a sensation my dear dr durant

  vaughn continued complimenting the sus-
ceptible doctor in this equivocal vein until
he gradually brought the subject around to
the senors ideas on atmosphere

   my theory he declared modestly
 isnt so stupendously original as yours it
really has more to do with the senoritas at-
mosphere than with her music

  dr durant gave a triumphant little
laugh  the atmosphere  am to provide
-

all-story weekly

for the divine young virtuoso will far dis-
count any that has gone before i have
scoured the new york galleries for hen-
ners-you know henner the great french
painter the secret of whose ravishing flesh
tones died with him

   oh yes-ive admired his  bather 
and  mary magdalen  at the metropolitan
museum-

    well ive found three companion pieces
to the  bather -real henners-the inimi-
table henneresque nudes foulderas gal-
lery on fifth avenue has been holding them
declining to sell as the price of genuine
henners is steadily increasing but i suc-
ceeded in getting them-and at a wonderful
bargain

   what did you pay

   fifty thousand dollars-

   what 

   but that was for all three and the
dealer assured me they are worth twice
that-

  vaughn barely suppressed a smile-and
a groan did senor arsenjo suggest your
buying them

   yes he said they would inspire his
daughter

   haveyou the pictures here

  no they havent been delivered yet
senor arsenjo suggested that we leave them
at the gallery till the morning of the re-
cital

   why

  he didnt say

   in what room is the senorita to play
dr durant took him up-stairs to the
large drawing-room it was connected with
the library by means of sliding doors

   ill push back these doors he ex-
plained  and both rooms will be one
they will easily accommodate one hundred
people the senorita is to play in the
library

   and the henners-where are they to
hang

  on a black curtain at that end of the
room the senor said they would show
better on black

  vaughn went to the other end of the
room a door broke the sweep of the left
wall and in the right-hand corner was a
sort of cabinet or bookcase with glass doors

built in the wall the doors were curtained
with scrim

  first vaughn opened the door in the left
wall it led into a narrow corridor con-
necting the main hall with a rear stairway
thus it afforded egress from the drawing-
room either down the front stairway or the
rear one next he went toward the built-in
cabinet

   originally that was a china closet ex-
plained dr durant  this room used to
be the dining-room and the room behind
was the kitchen but when i put in the
english basement i made this the drawing-
room the closet opens into the other room
as well as into this one

  vaughns eyes lit he opened the glass
doors and had an unimpeded view into the
other room-a kind of study littered with
old books and other literary rubbish

   excuse its appearance apologized the
doctor  nobody ever goes into it the
door that used to lead from this room to
that has been walled up

   there is no means of getting in there
save through these glass doors queried
vaughn eagerly

   that is all i intended to cut a door-
way leading into the room from the library
but never got around to it but mr
vaughn why does the room interest you
so has it anything to do with your at-
mosphere theory

   a very great deal answered vaughn
and then he astonished the doctor by crawl-
ing through the closet on his hands and
knees into the other room after which he
glanced around with a satisfied smile there
were no doors and the window was a
small one

  in a moment he had rejoined dr durant

   doctor may i have the use of this
room on the night of senorita arsenjos
recital

   certainly but you wont be able to
hear the music-

   i dont want to hear the music then
at the others wondering look he added
quickly  my theory doesnt require it
frankly i want to be where i can see and
yet not be seen the entire procedure must
be kept secret dont let senor arsenjo or
his daughter know theres a room here at
the head of arsenjo

-

all have some books placed in the closet
and let them show through the glass doors
-then theyll think it a mere bookcase
youll do this

   with the greatest pleasure aughed
dr durant  the thing is so mysterious
im beginning to feel as fascinated as by
my own experiments

  vaughn thanked him warmly and left
promising to be on hand thursday night
at least an hour earlier than the arsenjos

chapter iv

in the hollow of his hand

vaughn took a taxicab to the foul-
dera gallery on fifth avenue foul-
dera  co were among the largest
art dealers in new york devoting several
floors to the exhibition of pictures their
exhibits were usually popular with art
lovers and to-day vaughn found the rooms
crowded on the top floor were canvases
which were either not for sale or had al-
ready been sold and here the press of spec-
tators was not so great in a remote corner
at the end of the room he found what he
had been searching for-an ariist busily en-
gaged in copying a picture

  this in itself was not extraordinary
there were perhaps half a dozen artists
copying other canvases in the various rooms
of the establishment and they excited only
a languid interest on the part of the public
but vaughn felt almost a thrill at sight of
the copyist on the top floor-for the picture
he was copying was one of the henners

  though he had never seen him before
vaughn recognized him instantly - and
that too notwithstanding his disguise he
wore a gray wig and a gray mustache
near-sighted glasses and the regulation
artists smock but this garment loose and
shapeless though it was could not hide that
strangely short broad powerfully set-up
figure the copyist was the man who had
delivered the  flowers  at mrs foulkess
yesterday the footmans description fitted
him perfectly

  the pictures were hanging on the wall
above him all three were typical henners
-purplish-blue backgrounds greenish-blue

skies mossy banks on which sat titian-
haired nudes

   my friend said vaughn pleasantly 
 youre doing a good job

  the man grunted and shrugged his huge
shoulders vaughn drew a step nearer

   those fiesh-tones of yours he con-
tinued critically  need only one thing to
make them more like henner than henners
own-a dash of pale olive to give a bit more
warmth

  the copyist flashed a glance up at the
speaker stopped painting pushed his stool
back then looked with half-closed eyes at
the figure

   you are right he growled at last with
a mongrel spanish accent  i need more
green diable why not i see it myself
my color-eye no good and he angrily
mixed the paints

   youre doing very well indeed
vaughn encouraged him  where have
you studied-paris

   rome - paris - everywhere half
snarled the man shortly

  he began adding the henner green to
the nymphs flesh working for some mo-
ments in silence

  good cried vaugh with involuntary
admiration  thats the tint exactly-

  but suddenly the copyist sprang to his
feet with a series of oaths - degenerate
spanish mixed with half-breed indian a
sort of south american lingo vaughn
guessed

   no good  he exclaimed furiously  i
am fool to paint i paint no more not
even for him not for anybody he
snatched the canvas crushed the wooden
backing with his powerful hands then tak-
ing a curious-looking knife from his pocket
cut the picture in strips gathered up his
paints palette and stool and rushed out

  vaughn paid him the tribute of a thor-
oughly astonished whistle

  some temper a veritable madman
when hes roused i wonder how the senor
manages him well i can resume my study
of this rather extraordinary fellow to-mor-
row for hell be certain to come back to
go at his copying again as his master sim-
ply must have those bogus henners by
thursday
	all-story weekly

  when vaughn returned to the office he
found mcsurely waiting for him mac had
an interesting report he had two reports
in fact-the first concerning the mysterious
deliveryman-copyist the second having to
do with senorita dolores arsenjo and-
lieutenant bateson

  what gasped the chief is he
still storming her heart-and incidentally
risking being murdered by the irate papa
mac grinned  i took a taxi for the old
van loon place out on the drive now oc-
cupied by our friends the arsenjos and
had scarcely rounded the corner when a big
car came shooting out of the garage with
the big-shouldered fellow at the wheel it
pulled up at the front door and waited
meanwhile i directed the cabby to amble
down a side street at a speed of about a
mile and a half an hour so i could look
back and see what was happening natu-
rally i had to keep on the move or at least
make a bluff at it as i didnt want the
party of the shoulders to notice me hang-
ing round he waited a minute or so then
senor arsenjo came out of the house carry-
ing a big flat package the size of the blake-
lock-

   arsenjo himself youre sure

   he was certainly true to your descrip-
tion chief a black-eyed white-haired
grandee with a head like the one on that
biggest statue of jupiter up at the metro-
politan museum-

   thats arsenjo go ahead

   he put the package carefully on the
floor of the tonneau and covered it with the
lap-robe and then mr shoulders whizzed
off my old taxi was a bit decrepit and
the cabby had some time trying to keep the
other car in sight we followed shoulders
upon the staten island ferry-boat and then
after reaching st george he led us out
richmond terrace to a road that stretched
out toward the interior of the island we
never could have pretended to keep up with
him if his car hadnt gone wrong just after
he left the boat every few minutes he
was out tinkering with the engine

 he didnt turn around and see you
mac chuckled  he looked back in a
casual sort of way whenever he got out to
tinker with the engine and when he began

to slow down i had the cabby shoot off into
a crossroad or stop dead before some house
or turn round it worked too at last he
pulled up at a big dutch house in a thick
woods-a regular old-timer painted white
with old-fashioned green shutters and a
double porch shoulders jumped out took
the package to the door rang and then
disappeared inside-

   did you see who let him in

   i had the cabby halt behind a clump of
trees a good piece from the house and then
i used my field-glasses a woman opened
the door - old gray saffron-colored an-
other spaniard as sure as my names
michael maguinness mcsurely

   how long was shoulders inside the
house

   just a moment when he came out he
got busy with his engine again i drove
back to the st george ferry and by the
time i reached it he had caught up with me
we came over on the same boat and then
i trailed him back to the van loon place
on the drive fate was staging a luscious
little comedy when we arrived

   that khaki kid lieutenant bateson
was carrying off the stunning little senorita
in a bullet-shaped aluminum racer-the
worst little devil of a car you ever saw
old arsenjo hatless his head looking big
as a dome ran out after them raving and
shaking his fist when shoulders pulled
up he sprang in to give chase the khaki
kid laughed and waved him a good-by as
they shot away melc laughed at the recol-
lection shoot goes the bullet-shaped
racer shoot follows the other car then
that pesky engine goes wrong again and the
car slows down result-in about seven-
teen seconds and a half the bullet-shaped
racer is out of sight

   is arsenjo mad oh my is he
say you ought to have seen how he turned
and smashed shoulders on the jaw-
what cried vaughn astonished
 and what did shoulders do

   at first he seemed even madder than
arsenjo his face goes ultramarine and he
foams at the mouth out go those big
fingers like a stranglers and he seems ready
to do execution with them when suddenly
his arms drop and he turns away-for all
the head of arsenjo



the world like a big powerful mongrel cur
who realizes that the little dog he is about
to chew up is a canine aristocrat with a
pedigree hence out of his class and not his
meat grandee arsenjo glares at him then
jumps out and streaks it back into the
house shoulders waits a minute gazes
after the boss with the meanest look i ever
saw on a human phiz then gets busy on
that balky engine again i leave - and
thats all

  toward noon the next morning vaughn
went to the fouldera gallery and found
shoulders disguised in the gray wig and
mustache busily copying the same henner
he had been working on yesterday at
vaughns rather sudden appearance he
glanced up with a scowl fie had been
painting with marvelous rapidity for the
picture was almost done the new canvas
however did not show the excellence of
drawing and coloring that had characterized
the one he had so furiously destroyed had
arsenjo struck him again and was he
sullenly indifferent as a consequence

   what bring you here he snarled
 you like henner so wonderful well or
you never see anybody paint before
vaughn smiled disarmingly  i like
henner-who doesnt i want to buy
those three paintings-

   so you cant buy sold already

   to whom

  the quick query caught shoulders un-
awares he flushed a coppery red looked
up at vaughn with furtive questioning-
though as yet with no open suspicion-
then smiled nonchalantly

   who buy friend of mine gentle-
man from venezuela fie take flenners to
national gallery at caracas as gift good
man yes and he laughed softly turning
to work on the canvas again

  vaughn kept after him  why does he
want copies of the pictures-for himself
 no i make copies for myself-i love
beautiful pictures i study art like mad-
man i say to myself i will be great
painter but no go i am torn away from
work i love so now i am nobody-noth-
ing-last of my race he sighed bit-
terly  maybe i was born to be slave-he
says so but i hate it-i hate it his

eyes flashed behind his glasses his ponder-
ous chest heaved

  vaughn watched him fascinated what
did his curious reference to a state of
slavery mean had arsenjo enslaved him
-if not legally then by some stronger
power some life-and-death hold over him
he called himself a slave he-had borne a
humiliating blow from arsenjo without
striking back did not these things show
him to be of an inferior race perhaps he
was an ecuadorean half-breed a mestizo
maybe a full-blooded indian

  but shoulders was speaking again-and
in tense clicking tones  i was wonder-
ful fellow i could do many things i
paint pictures i make pottery and draw
queer figures on it i make jewelry that
look like a hundred years old out of gold
and silver i do everything in world once
what do i do now

  vaughn smiled  youre copying that
flenner-and making a good job of it

   i dont mean what  do this minute-
but what  do all the time

   well what do you do all the time

  he seemed on the point of speaking out
then frowning he shook his head and
turned to the canvas  who are you
stranger to me you think i am fool for
telling you so much well what i tell
you is fairy story he chuckled  good-
by you are not bad man but you talk
much i must work like five men to get
henner done before noon

  vaughn hesitated made as if to demur at
this abrupt breaking off of a very interest-
ing conversation then on second thought
uttered a good-humored good-by and left
the gallery he could afford to wait to get
better acquainted with this rather sinister
artist he had him-as well as his master
arsenjo-and arsenjos beautiful daughter
-in the hollow of his hand

chapter v

the center of the stage

on the next thursday night vaughn
was the first of dr durants guests
to arrive for the recital a close
second was lieutenant bateson each


all-story weekly

opened his eyes a bit at sight of the other
bateson of course had not recognized the
detective at mrs foulkess in his disguise
of mr spencer of chicago but of the
two vaughn was the more surprised how
had the young soldier secured an invita-
tion to dr durants house surely he did
not move in the old occultists somewhat
mildewed set but what is impossible to a
man in love

   mrs whymper did it for me ex-
plained bateson with a rollicking little
laugh reading the query in vaughns eyes
 thats a smart woman she had a lot of
trouble getting me the bid but managed to
put it through but how did you get in
vaughn smiled  im lucky enough to
know the doctor

   and you simply cant resist the divine
senoritas music eh

   certainly not-who could im almost
as interested in it as you-

  bateson flushed but took it good-humor-
edly  scarcely to tell you the truth
im falling madly in love with that radiant
girl

   h-m half grunted vaughn  what
cloes her father say

  the young soldier laughed-then apolo-
gized for his mirth  i admit i ought to
take the senor more seriously but by jove
hes as good as a musical comedy how
that man does rave several days ago i
met senorita arsenjo in riverside park
for a wonder she was alone and i prompt-
ly introduced myself telling her that mrs
whymper had arranged to present me any-
way-and so on i said i had heard her
play that she was the greatest ever that i
banged the piano some myself-well thats
the way it started then later at mrs
foulkess her accompanist suddenly be-
came ill and i took her place senor ar-
senjo didnt like it a bit earlier in the
evening the divine senorita promised to take
a spin with me in my little bullet car so
the next morning i called and took her
away right under her fathers nose angry
good heavens his rage absolutely curdled
the atmosphere

   the arsenjos are extraordinarily inter-
esting persons remarked vaughn casually
 who make up the household

   senorita valdez an old domestic or so
and-miguel

   miguel who is he

   the senors combined bodyguard
chauffeur valet and i dont know what else
from what senorita dolores says hes a
very useful person

   hes a spaniard

   no a mestizo-thats south american
for half-breed

  vaughn made his way out of the crowded
reception-room and hurried up-stairs to the
drawing-room which fortunately he found
still empty everything was arranged for
the recital the grand piano was standing
at one end of the room at the other were
the three henners hung on black velvet
in the soft pink-shaded light the flesh of
the nude figure looked startlingly warm and
lifelike never had the great henner seemed
so like himself and so unlike all the rest
of painters and dr durant had paid
fifty thousand dollars for this trio of fair
women what glorious booty jose arsenjo
was expecting

  vaughn went to the closet in the corner
made a passageway through the books
he replaced all the books against the glass
doors and crawled through to the store-
room beyond here in darkness himself
he could see everything that happened in
the drawing-room the position was ideal
he replaced all the books against the glass
doors-save one or two here and there to
afford space through which to see and then
he drew up a chair and made himself com-
fortable

  in a short while the guests began pour-
ing into the drawing-room and seating them-
selves they were a rather motley throng
as dr durant knew many eccentric people
now and then some well-known society
figure such as mrs whymper relieved the
freakish monotony lieutenant bateson
vaughn noticed with a smile had placed
himself under that ladys protection

  everything went off as at previous re-
citals until the second part of the program
had been reached here was where the
 spell  usually began to work arsenjo
rose and began to speak his tones were
softly modulated and vaughn behind the
glass could not catch what he was saying
the head of arsenjo



whatever it was it did not seem to be the
rather hackneyed story about the indian
mother crooning to her babe vaughn
opened one of the doors an inch or two to
hear

  the indian mother had been abandoned
arsenjo was telling a new tale about the
ill-starred atahualpa the last emperor of
the incas whom the treacherous pizarro
put to death  senorita arsenjo will play
you  atahualpas swan song ladies and
gentlemen the senor was saying  i com-
posed the piece on my last visit to cuzco
the ancient capital of peru and he went
on to describe the various movements of
the composition in the florid terms so dear
to the spanish-american heart vaughn
listened with amusement mingled with won-
der at the mans fantastic cleverness

  when arsenjo finished his story he and
senorita valdez disappeared through the
doorway leading into the hall and dolores
unaccompanied began playing  atahual-
pas swan song vaughn breathlessly in-
terested took a small but powerful pair of
field-glasses from his pocket to have in
readiness when arsenjo returned mean-
while roving his gaze from the violinist to
the three henners at the far end of the
room for a while however nothing hap-
pened dolores played on serenely the
audience though seeming to enjoy the
music as yet exhibited no sign of succumb-
ing to the usual spell arsenjo was slow in
reappearing and certainly-so far-the
henners had not been exchanged

  vaughn was growing a bit restive when
he noticed the black velvet curtains part
gradually and arsenjo thrust his splendid
head into the drawing-room evidently
he had reentered by the door behind the
draperies he waited a moment casting his
eyes the length of the room to where
dolores stood playing then casually-yet
with studiously soft footfalls-advanced

  this was the signal for vaughn to do two
things he noiselessly closed the glass
doors-as a practical means of resisting the
spell-and then lifted the field-glasses to his
eyes of course arsenjo was in full view
as it was and not more than fifty feet
away but vaughn was particularly desirous
of keeping the closest possible watch on his

hands one hung at his side the other was
thrust with apparent carelessness between
his coat and waistcoat that was the hand
that vaughn watched-tirelessly but it
remained hidden-and nothing happened

  the strains of the music had of course
reached vaughn in his covert but he had
listened only desultorily now however
engrossed though he was in watching the
exact spot on arsenjos coat behind which
the mysteriously secreted hand lay he was
thrilled by a sudden deep vibrant note of
the violin and just after this note had
ascended and died away the hidden hand
suddenly appeared and by means of a min-
iature contrivance on the order oj an
atomizer discharged some subtle gas or at-
tenuated liquid over the heads oj the
audience

  the spell

  it was just as vaughn had suspected
from the beginning a drug-but an incredi-
bly powerful one vaporized doubtless-a
drug distilled perhaps from some unknown
plant that grew in the hot fever-laden
forests of arsenjos own ecuador this it
was then that had benumbed his victims
senses giving them dreams of beatific har-
monies-and incidentally makjng the senor-
ita famous as the greatest violinist in the
world

  but if the drug threw over the audience
an enchantment that only fell short of un-
consciousness itself how could arsenjo and
dolores resist it dolores did not resist it
she had always fainted before the end of
the  tropical lullaby -would she not
faint while playing  atahualpas swan
song 

  but her father- vaughn had scarcely
asked himself the question when arsenjo
buried his nose in his handkerchief this
simple proceeding surely was not sufficient
to make him immune to the effects of the
drug perhaps between times he went out
for a breath of fresh air

  this surmise was correct arsenjo used
his spraying contrivance several times in
succession then hurried behind the black
curtains the handkerchief still pressed to
his nostrils vaughn now turned his atten-
tion to dolores he could not see her face
but certainly her playing was growing


all-story weekly

heavy and languorous as for her listeners
they were becoming markedly somnolent
vaughn judged the drif to be somewhat
similar to indian hashish in its curious
combination of physically depressing and
mentally exhilarating qualities but after
all its astonishing effects were peculiarly its
own

  in a moment arsenjo returned this
time he parted the curtains and advanced
toward the audience with far less caution
than before senorita dolores was still
playing but with only the faintest of sounds
and the slowest of motions had she re-
sisted the full effects of the drug so far
as vaughn wondered she staggered sud-
denly and would have fallen had not senor-
ita valdez hurried in from the hall caught
her and then half dragged her from the
room at the same instant arsenjo his
handkerchief covering the entire lower half
of his face discharged the drug once more
over the heads of the audience

  now was the moment to begin watching
the three henners vaughn discarding the
tield-glasses fixed his gaze on the pictures
but now there was an untoward happening
-one he might have anticipated the
lights went out that was his first disap-
pointed supposition when a sudden pall of
darkness blotted out the view but in a
moment he realized they had only been
lowered-to a great extent it was true but
still not sufficiently to keep him in utter
ignorance of what was going on in the other
room of the dozen electric lights that had
been turned on perhaps one of very low
candle-power was still burning this one
hidden behind the frieze gave only the
dimmest and ghostliest of lights evidently
arsenjo had familiarized himself with the
workings of the switch

  he could easily be located by the white
handkerchief over his face he stood mo-
tionless a moment then went toward the
curtains immediately they parted and a
figure appeared in the dimness the face
was only a pale patch but by its relatively
short distance from the floor vaughn judged
the newcomer to be the undersized mestizo
miguel

  miguel was carrying what seemed to be
a bundle about the same size as the three

henners would have been if wrapped to-
gether he and his master bent over this
bundle and after a short parley arsenjo
got a chair miguel stepped upon it-and in
a moment vaughn saw the big thing done
keeping his eyes on the three henners he
watched them disappear one at a time the
curtains showing an unbroken surface of
black then after a minute the three copies
were hung in their place miguel doing the
job with incredible quickness

  the originals were wrapped then both
men disappeared behind the curtain arsen-
jo was absent a few minutes-long enough
to see miguel safely out of the house when
he came back he turned on the lights then
advancing opened the door leading to the
hall presumably to let in fresh air he
then vanished through the doorway - for
the purpose vaughn guessed of seeing if
everything was going well with dolores and
senorita valdez

  he had been gone only a few moments
when the crowd began to show unmistak-
able signs of coming out from under the in-
fluence of the drug dr durant suddenly
staggered to his feet then after a falsetto
laugh began to make a speech vaughn
curious to hear what he had to say opened
one of the glass doors an inch or two and
listened though more or less himself
again it was plain the aged theorist had
not shaken himself entirely free of the
effects of the drug

   ladies and gentlemen i know all of
you will agree with me that we have just 
had a taste of heaven more than ever
am i-

  he got no farther at that moment
senorita dolores leaning on the arm of her
father appeared in the hall doorway and
the crowd burst into a storm of applause
that drowned all other sounds dolores
touched by this demonstration took a step
inside the room her action displeased her 
father he frowned shook his head then
assuming the prerogative of a parent deal-
ing with a small child deliberately took her
by the hand and attempted to lead her back
into the hall this roused the young wo-
man she broke from his grasp then ran
to the center of the room bowed and began
throwing kisses to her admirers
the head of arsenjo



  this was too much for the impulsive
bateson he sprang to his feet

   three cheers for senorita dolores ar-
senjo he cried the worlds greatest
violinist

  but arsenjo white with rage rushed
back and interrupted him

  we will have no cheering i wont
allow it this is not an army encampment
a college campus or a street corner-

  bateson daredevilishly cut him short
 three cheers for the greatest violinist that
ever lived one two-

  but he never reached  three he paled
suddenly gasped gagged then ran out into
the hall everybody gazed after him in
surprise dolores and arsenjo no less than
the others mrs whymper who looked de-
cidedly worried turned to the host

   dr durant im afraid lieutenant
bateson has been suddenly taken ill per-
haps youll go and see-

   certainly and the doctor hurried
out

  everybody was excited-disproportion-
ately so considering the comparative in-
significance of the incident perhaps it was
its dramatic suddenness that had taken the
crowds breath away presently dolores
who had been speaking to her father in low
vehement tones left him in a pout and came
toward vaughns covert immediately ar-
senjo followed both were angry

  you must come home he said
vaughn could plainly hear every word

   not until i hear about lieutenant
bateson 

  arsenjos magnificent brow clouded
 what is this man to you do you love
him

  she gave a tantalizing little laugh  i
dont know-yet but he is really very
charming

  arsenjo forgetting himself in his rage
seized her wrist vaughn who had a full
view of his face was astounded by its
malevolence

   dolores i warn you never to speak to
this lieutenant bateson again he is a
poverty-stricken wastrel chronic borrower
and breaker of womens hearts he is hope-
lessly in debt and is unworthy of you in
every way listen even if this man in
  a-s

khaki were twenty times a millionaire with
a character above reproach i should still in-
sist that you shun him you shall never
marry-i have consecrated your life to art
you are-

  but she left him abruptly and hurried
toward the hall doorway her quick eye
had caught sight of dr durant returning

   what of lieutenant bateson she
queried anxiously

  dr durant looked rather serious  i
found him very ill indeed he had been
seized with a terrible nausea he recovered
sufficiently to take a cab home and wished
me to say good night for him

  this was all vaughn could catch of the
colloquy meanwhile his attention had been
attracted to arsenjo who at the news of
batesons illness had given a perceptible
start after which he had seemingly plunged
into deep thought in a moment flashing a
strange half-questioning glance at dolores
he hurried from the room she did not see
him leave as she was still talking to dr
durant

  he was gone scarcely a minute he made
a dramatic entry rushing to dr durant
and crying excitedly

  my daughters priceless stradivarius
has been stolen

  everybody began talking simultaneously
dolores burst into tears declaring hyste-
rically she would never play again if her
beloved violin was not found dr durant
insisted he was willing to have every nook
and cranny of the house searched - the
servants quarters even his own room sev-
eral of the more feather-headed of the
guests unconscious of the absurdity of the
thing averred their eagerness to have their
persons searched then somebody the
voice above the din sounded like mrs
whympers had the good sense to suggest
that maybe senor arsenjo was mistaken

   mistaken echoed arsenjo with of-
fended dignity  come with me and ill
show you the violin is gone

  immediately the excited throng hurried
out of the room dolores in advance when
the sound of their footsteps had died away
down the hall vaughn removed the friendly
camouflage of the books and crawled from
his covert what an evening it had been


all-story weekly

and what an unexpected ending to the re-
cital who would have dreamed the cre-
mona violin would rob the three henners
of the center of the stage

  vaughn went the length of the room to
take a closer look at miguels copies they
were hung rather crookedly and both
technique and color were only indifferent-
the mestizos growing hatred of arsenjo was
betraying itself in his work but at any
rate henners name in the corner of the
canvases was not wet as blakelocks had
been

  vaughn had stood contemplating the pic-
tures for some moments when he felt a tap
on his shoulder he turned and looked into
the anxious ancient face of dr marcus
aurelius durant

  thank heaven gasped the old man
 theyve all gone the violin is still miss-
ing but senor arsenjo at my earnest en-
treaty has promised not to put the case
into the hands of the police until i have
had a little detective work done on my own
account mr vaughn your presence here
is providential i want you to make a
thorough investigation - search the house
and question the servants youll do this
for me

  vaughn yawned  i dare say but dont
be too hopeful the stradivarius is not in
this house

   im glad to hear you say that ive
always regarded my servants as honest-
theyve been with me a long time he
gave a sudden exclamative as he gazed up
at miguels three copies  good gracious
ive just thought- what if the thief gets
a look at my henners hadnt i better
put them in a safety-deposit vault

   you neednt feel alarmed vaughn an-
swered dryly  our thief isnt after hen-
ners iust now come take me to the room
where the violin was

chapter vi

 miss mary jane smith

the room from which the cremona
violin had disappeared a small parlor
some distance down the hall-which
had been used as senorita arsenjos dress-

ing-room-gave vaughn absolutely no lead
his rather perfunctory questioning of the
servants was without result also this
however was only what he had expected
so when he said good night to the half-
distraught doctor he exhorted him not to
despair  give me a day or so he said
 and i feel confident i can trace the miss-
ing instrument

  bright and early the next morning he set
mcsurely to work investigating what had
happened at the senoritas recitals prior to
the one at mrs whympers

   now mac the first thing to do is to
look up the files of the newspapers and go
through the society columns there youll
find mention of senorita arsenjos recitals
which are purely society functions new
york has been discussing the young lady
for a long time and i figure she must have
performed on some ten or a dozen different
occasions before her appearance at mrs
whympers write down the names of the
people who have had her play and bring the
list to me

  mcsurely had not been gone five minutes
when vaughn was surprised by a visit from
the last man in new york he had expected
to see-senor jose arsenjo the senor had
never appeared to better advantage smil-
ing suave groomed to perfection his up-
sweep of hair showing dazzlingly white
above the surpassing brow he surely looked
-and acted-the part of proud father to
the greatest violinist in the world

   mr vaughn he said after introduc-
ing himself with the courtliness of an old
andalusian grandee  ive come to you be-
cause youre declared to be not only the
ablest but the most trustworthy detective
in new york i remember meeting you at
mrs whympers a short time ago with
almost superhuman cleverness you discov-
ered that her valuable kang-hsi vase had
been exchanged for a fake by the way
have you succeeded in tracing the original
 not yet senor arsenjo

   no too bad well i have another
mystery for you to solve my daughters
thirty-thousand-dollar cremona violin was
stolen at dr durants last night

  vaughns look of surprise was an artistic
simulation  what how did it happen
the head of arsenjo



  arsenjo secured the detectives promise to
take the case then with considerable cir-
cumlocution detailed the circumstances in
connection with the disappearance of the
violin he described the small parlor
stressing the fact that it was near the de-
scending stairway thus making egress easy
and then he calculated the length of time
the instrument had been left unguarded in
the room so far he had not hinted at any
suspicion of his own

   i must ask you a few questions said
vaughn

   proceed

   who took the violin from the drawing-
room to the small parlor

   my daughter

   is she in the habit of carelessly leaving
it lying about

   no its too valuable an instrument
   why did she leave it last night

   she was recalled to acknowledge a fool-
ish belated burst of applause it was led
by a certain lieutenant bateson who in-
sisted on making himself-and her-ridicu-
lous by proposing three stupid cheers for
her a la some vulgar football rooter he
paused emphasizing the next words strong-
ly  all this of course took time

   how much

   three or four minutes then another
incident took still more time bateson be-
came suddenly ill-as we all thought he
rushed out of the drawing-room and dr
durant followed to offer assistance the
doctor was absent another five minutes and
when he came back he said bateson had
had an attack of nausea and had gone
home in a moment i returned to the parlor
and found-

   one moment where was senorita
valdez all this time

  arsenjo hesitated  she had gone home
immediately after the recital

   why

   she had a maddening headache and
declared shed faint unless she could get out
into the fresh air i bade her go on home
in my car as i would call a taxicab for my
daughter and myself

   and so each of you forgot to keep an
eye upon the violin

   exactly

  vaughn smiled  well senor arsenjo
i dont think ill have much trouble tracing
it the case is a very simple one no doubt
one of dr durants servants is the thief-
arsenjo fell into the trap-eagerly
 never to me the thing is clear as day
the culprit is-lieutenant bateson

  vaughn pretended surprise what
isnt this a rather far-fetched idea why
should lieutenant bateson descend to the
level of a common thief

  arsenjo smiled derisively  as you
americans put it he needs the money he
is heavily in debt the violin is worth
thirty thousand dollars at least-a respect-
able piece of booty even for an army officer
he made his plans some time ago he in-
troduced himself to my daughter and then
forced himself upon us as her accompanist
at mrs lorillard foulkess later against
my express wishes he took her motoring
at dr durants he led the applause to
recall us to the drawing-room then feigning
nausea took the violin and hurried away
and this was the basis of arsenjos sus-
picions vaughn almost laughed aloud a
sieve was no fuller of holes than this theory
of batesons guilt

   senor arsenjo there are a dozen fatal
objections to your theory how did lieu-
tenant bateson know senorita arsenjo
would respond to the belated encore how
did he know you would return with her-
that she would leave the violin behind-
that senorita valdez had gone home-that
you and your daughter after his attack of
nausea would remain long enough in the
drawing-room to give him the opportunity
to go to the small parlor and make away
with the instrument besides didnt dr
durant go to the door with him when he
left how could bateson have carried the
violin out without the doctors seeing him
arsenjo smiled blandly  all this sounds
very convincing mr vaughn but if you
were to find the instrument in his posses-
sion you would admit i know what im
talking abouj wouldnt you

  this time vaughns surprise was not
simulated  do you mean to tell me lieu-
tenant bateson actually has the violin
now

   im not saying just that-i dont want


all-story weekly

to spoil the zest of the search suppose
you investigate the thing for yourself call
on lieutenant bateson he keeps an apart-
ment in the city and usually i understand
runs up from camp for the week-ends this
week he came yesterday-a day earlier than
usual-to be on hand at dr durants last
night so i have no doubt hes in town to-
day youll hunt him up

   at once trust me senor to get at the
truth

  arsenjo rose  thats what we want
if bateson is innocent he of course has
nothing to fear-

  vaughn gazed at him steadfastly  and
if hes guilty-if i find the violin in his pos-
session-i am to deliver him to the police
arsenjo studied a moment but it was
rather poor acting-he had the air of a man
who had already made up his mind  well
no report to me first if we get the
violin and if he promises to cease annoying
my daughter i may waive arrest and prose-
cution for the sake of his uniform

to be continued next week don
that you will get the continuation of

    he left his address then after a smiling
 good-by took his departure

    ten minutes later vaughn had his second
 surprise of the morning

    miss mary jane smith wishes to see
 mr vaughn announced the telephone girl
 in the main office

    what is miss mary jane smiths busi-
 ness

    she wishes to consult you pro-
 fessionally

     tell her to come in

   the fact that a miss mary jane smith
 had called was not in itself particularly
 astonishing nor was it any more a matter
 for wonder when miss mary jane smith
 glided into the private office dressed in
 black and heavily veiled all kinds of
 people consulted owen vaughn but when
 miss mary jane smith at his courteous in-
 vitation to sit down hesitated she laughed
 softly and then threw back her veil reveal-
 ing the altogether lovely face of dolores
 arsenjo

duvernet rabell

borden clasped his hands under his
head and leaned back with a luxu-
rious sigh in his swinging bombay

chair

 please let me be lazy he begged
 talk to me-spin me one of those fairy
tales of yours and just let me sit here and
listen

nielsene harwich put her crystal liqueur

glass on the tray and nodded a dismissal
to the turbaned moro who stood at her
elbow she drew one foot in its dark blue
satin slipper up under her body as she sat
curled on the broad seat that ran around
the edge of the balcony

  the mango-trees were motionless in the
still night air there was the heady scent
of some too sweet tropical flower and from
circe or ruth



a cluster of native huts around the corner
of the square came the sound of a poignant-
ly tender voice singing a iove-song

   you like me as a teller of tales niel-
sene questioned in her slow sweet voice
 it amuses you when i weave dreams for
you well enjoy it to its fullest to-night
-for to-morrow i go back to my planta-
tion

   you are leaving burdanao borden
asked in surprise

  the girl nodded and raised her voice
 mr kipp she called to a group of white-
clad officers who talked in low tones over
their cigarettes at the other end of the bal-
cony  did you not say that you expected
two of your war-ships to come in to-mor-
row

   thats what i said and the speaker
rose as if to join them but some one mur-
mured a low-voiced protest there was a
half-smothered laugh and he sank back
into his seat

   you see and nielsene turned to
borden with a quick gesture of her hands

   but i dont see why you want to leave
just now the arrival of the ships-

   so you dont understand nielsene
interrupted him  why have you not been
told i wonder to-morrow two of your
war-ships come to the island and at once
the wives and sisters and sweethearts fol-
low from manila then i go- oh dont
you understand at all you boys all come
here when your ships are in the harbor-i
like to have you-father likes to have you
we wish you to dine with us-it gives me
the opportunity to meet men of my own
station and i dont have many chances
like that now that father has settled down
and no longer wanders from one end of the
world to the other

   but the women of the navy-dont you
want to meet women of your own station
too

  nielsene flashed him a smile  oh no-
women they ask too many questions and
elevate their eyebrows too easily they
are not content to take a girl as they find
her and i - i will not be whispered
about and accepted on sufferance she
leaned forward suddenly  bob tell me-
do you know anything of me at all

  borden shook his head troubled dark
eyes on her face  i wish you wouldnt
talk like this nielsene i dont want to
know-

   why she questioned looking at him
out of intent blue eyes  why-do you
not care enough to be interested of all
the men who come here leonard kipp
mr jackson-young hanson-i thought
you were most my friend and yet you
are content to let me drift into your life
and out again to know nothing of me at
all

  borden caught her hand  that isnt so
i do like you-you know i do-but you
dont know how much oh nielsene-
his voice deepened with growing ardor but
the girl checked him swiftly

   just a moment bob i want to talk
to-night-oh i know i always talk-but
to-night i am going to talk about myselfj
let me please

  let you why nielsene dont you
know that i want to hear anything you
want to tell me i have wondered about
you-how such a girl as you beautiful
talented clever could be content to spend
her days on this little island in a corner
of the tropics with nothing nearer civili-
zation than manila-and when youve said
that you havent said much

   but i havent always lived here-just
these last two years i was educated in
the best schools in europe and during my
vacations father took me everywhere-
london paris st petersburg and vienna
i was young and i dare say none too dis-
criminating and i drank life in deep drafts
it was enough for me if the people i knew
were interesting amusing - although even
now when i am more worldly wise i laugh
at pretensions about position class distinc-
tion i get that from my mother i think
she was great enough to make her own so-
cial laws and to know the people who
pleased her

   do you remember your mother niel-
sene

   no-not at all she left the island
soon after i was born she was unhappy
here father met her in manila you know
-long ago years before the americans
came she was a beautiful danish dancer


all-story weekly

so beautiful and of such charm that men
fell down and worshiped at her feet when-
ever they looked upon her but she loved
father best of all and they were married
and he built a wonderful place in the in-
terior of the island here and brought her
home a bride

   but her spirit died and her heart cried
out for lost gaieties as she had danced
into my fathers life so she danced out
again but she left me here with him so
that he would always remember that she
had loved him poor father he must have
suffered dreadfully she paused a mo-
ment  father is odd you know he
doesnt belong out here at all

  borden nodded  ive often thought
that he told me once that he came from
new england-how on earth did he ever
drift to this part of the world

    oh he listened to siren voices and fol-
lowed the will-o-the-wisp looking for the
answer to the big riddle but he never
found it and he is still seeking although
his wanderings are over his adventures are
now between the pages of great books i
liked the other way best except when
there come war-ships to the harbor i am
very bored

   why dont you travel surely you
have plenty of friends who would be glad
to have you with them

   no i would not leave father the
only reason i will ever leave him will be
because i have learned to love some other
man so well that  cannot live without him
-that i will have to follow him wherever
he may go

  borden drew a deep breath  will you
ever care like that nielsene

  the girl clasped her slender long-fingered
hand about her knee and stared into the
black shadow of the mango-tree  as to
that she was beginning when there was
the sound of chairs being pushed back from
the other end of the balcony

   going now kipp sang out of the
darkness  come along bob

 will you let me come out into the
country to see you borden asked eagerly
as he said good-by   want to-i must
the light from the room beyond fell
across the sleek blond braids of the girls

hair and lit up her sea-blue eyes  you
want to - you must she repeated mock-
ingly although there was a hint of some-
thing softer in her voice then she lifted
her beautiful bare shoulder  i will see-
if i find the days contain too many hours
without you i will send for you no-no
i will not promise

  borden walked ahead down the street
toward the bay with a laughing group of
the younger men while leonard kipp and
tom jackson fell behind kipp was pro-
testing irritably

    dont see why you take that tone
with me he was saying  its not up to
me in the first place-and anyhow if bob
borden sees fit to lose his head over this
pretty siren of the tropics i for one think
the experience will do him good

   still jackson maintained  i think
you should have warned him

   what about-and how is there any-
thing definite about nielsene harwich of
course there isnt ill admit that she isnt-
of course her father-their position- oh
hang it all bob isnt serious you know

  and whats a flirtation its the ex-
pected thing

   and nielsene harwich is lovely enough
to be a temptation to any man to begin
with shes a golden blonde in a country of
dusky women-i think that is what first
sent bob off his head that wonderful
golden fairness of hers that white skin
with the rose of the northern countries in
her cheeks and the cold blue of the north
in her eyes-that and her angular slim-
ness when youve been fed up on black-
eyed women who are all dumpy curves and
undulating hips

  jackson shrugged and stopped to light a
cigar all right youve been bordens
chum since your academy days-you ought
to know but i tell you leonard bob
borden is a man of dreams hes an ideal-
ist-a man of his sort takes love deep into
his soul

   i cant see that his soul is concerned
with this at all was all the satisfaction he
got from kipp

  but romance moves with winged feet in
the tropics and men will cling to that old
creed of theirs that a man must go his own
circe or ruth



way in an affair of the heart so that while
his fellow officers were by no means blind
to the state of bordens infatuation for
nielsene harwich none of them were ready
to be the ftsst to man the life-boat

  three days after the war-ships had
dropped anchor in the little harbor of bur-
danao when the one street of the tiny town
was bright with the light dresses of the
women who had followed their ships from
manila borden received a note from niel-
sene she said he could come out to the
plantation if he cared to

  and he cared to in the three days she
had been away he had not been able to get
her face out of his mind and the sound of
her voice with its thousand minor cadences
out of his ears he wanted to see her to
have her laugh at him as she so often did
to watch her idly swinging in her deep
chair her slim white hands folded in her
lap and in her deep blue eyes the mystery
of dreams

  he knew now that he loved her and that
when he went into the interior to see her
after a wonderful evening of her laughter
her songs and her intoxicating companion-
ship he would tell her so and ask her to
marry him but first he would have two
or three golden hours

  then a streak that was very predominant
in borden asserted itself back in the old
annapolis days-and they were not so far
back after all-borden had captained his
football team the men used to laugh at
him argue and finally shrug and accept
the fact that borden always tackled the
hardest struggle first the team that would
give them the biggest battle was played as
early in the season as borden could man-
age

  get it overhe used to say and
then you know where you stand

  and this is the way he came to feel about
nielsene he had no way of knowing
whether the girl cared for him or not-but
he had to find out as soon as he could even
if he lost forever such few hours she had
been granting him and drew a black mist
of misery over the rest of his stay on the
island

  nielsene was waiting for him the night
he went out to see her she rose from her

chair at the edge of the wide veranda that
overlooked a garden full of heavily scented
flowers with both hands outstretched

   you see she said softly  the days
proved by actual count to contain more
than their allotted number of hours

  before he left her that evening borden
asked her the question that had been in
his heart for days he looked about the
luxurious room in which they sat drinking
their black coffee

   i havent much to offer you dear he
sighed then he took her two hands and
pressed them to his lips  but i love you
-very dearly

  nielsene slipped forward in her low chair
and dropped to her knees at his feet she
released her slim white hands and clasped
them about his neck drawing his face down
to hers

   but you love me she demanded her
blue eyes searching his  you love me-
there will never be anybody or anything
but me in your life

  bordens arms folded about her
 never with a love like mine everything
but you would be crowded out

  she seemed content with this presently
she raised her head  you must love me
like that oh dearest because my love is
like that-and i could never exchange a big
love for a little love i must be all to you
 and are you not all  look right at
me and tell me you do not know that
but instead she laughed softly  i
know i know-i think i have always
known

   always

   yes-from the first moment my eyes
met yours at that moment i wanted you
-you will never know how much-and i
made up my mind to have you she
laughed with one of her quick transitions
of mood  bob boy of mine you never
had a chance from the first

  man the conqueror was not so well
pleased at this  could you be so sure
 all my life i have known men niel-
sene told him -  the best and worst of
them many have loved me-many have
wanted me-

  borden placed a protesting finger on her
soft lips  dont talk so-i dont like it


all-story weekly

  the girl sank back on her heels and
looked up into his face with wide blue eyes
 but why if i had not seen love in all
phases under all circumstances how could
i know i love you the way i do she let
him take her in his arms again  let me
tell you just how much you are loved-oh
caro mio

  and of course at this bordens protest
died away and his heart leaped to the
sound of her vibrant caressing voice as
sweet and as full of love as that of the
nightingales singing outside the window

  bordens new-found joy was too deep to
keep to himself jackson had the deck at
the hour of his return and he told him at
once of his great luck and demanded con-
gratulations

   jackson gave them to the best of his abil-
ity and an hour later he knocked at the
door of kipps room he seated himself on
the edge of the bunk and regarded his
friend with a malevolent i-told-you-so ex-
pression

   whats your trouble kipp inquired
throwing aside a battered magazine which
he had been reading

   you are an authority on love arent
you jackson demanded dryly  when it
comes to knowing the signs of the tender
passion going and coming-when it comes
to judging the real things for the pastime-
you are in a class by yourself humph
did you ever notice that it is always the
expert swimmer who gets drowned

   ive noticed that the tropics dont
agree with you kipp retorted at once
 and that if you want to save a vestige
of what you are pleased to call your brain
you had better apply for leave

  jackson dropped his levity his news
was important enough to stand without
rhetorical dressing  bob borden is en-
gaged to nielsene harwich

  kipp glanced quickly at his friend
 how do you know

    he told me so

   good night then after a sober mo-
ment  now what are we going to do
jackson rose and laughed shortly  the
time has passed to do anything but make
the best of it

   i guess youre right kipp shook his

head regretfully then suddenly he chuck-
led  i am thinking of the day when bob
presents nielsene barbarously beautiful
and with the manner of a sultans favorite
to the wives of his fellow officers

    yes and its the one thing that has to
be done-it ought to be done at once too
ill have molly ask her in to tea or some-
thing- shell hate it but molly is wise
and the thing will be managed as well as it
can be managed

  but in spite of good management much
tact and the best will in the world the af-
ternoon nielsene came in from the country
in her rickshaw with its gaily liveried run-
ners was an awful occasion a spirit of
impish mischief seemed to possess the girl
to begin with there was her gown it was
of blue-the blue of gleaming frost-and
the illusion was helped out by unexpected
bits of crystal glittering here and there in
its folds it was elaborately lovely-but
scarcely the thing to wear to a simple af-
ternoon tea in the tropics

  against the background of a modern
luxurious drawing-room in paris or possi-
bly budapest it would have been wonder-
fully effective here it was merely startling
and her manners nielsene laughed now
and then a sweet drawling laughter with
no particle of warmth in it but she didnt
trouble herself to say more than fifty words
during the whole afternoon

  the women looked her over talked
among themselves shook their heads-but
decided to be nice to her for bordens sake
and instead they found the girl bob bor-
den was going to marry being nice to them
that is when she saw them-which was as
seldom as she could manage she ex-
plained sweetly to borden that she didnt
care much for women she could think of
nothing to talk to them about and she ab-
solutely refused to drink tea with them and
listen to the traditions of the navy of the
country she was going to marry into she
didnt understand much about the ways of
the service and her lack of understanding
didnt seem to trouble her any

   of course i love bobs country she
drawled to the amused captain of the flag-
ship- it has such a pretty flag

  borden remonstrated with her-oh very
circe or ruth



gently and tenderly-and forthwith she put
her two soft arms about his neck and with
her lips almost on his invented new love
names for him until he forgot there was a
world outside her arms

  but things couldnt go on like this a
mans life-work and his love could not be
at such utter variance and not bring dis-
aster somewhere

  one day nielsene sent for borden and
when he entered the long dimly lit drawing-
room he found her in a mood of wild ex-
citement

  something wonderful has happened
she exclaimed  ive been waiting watch-
ing and hoping-and now it comes-the
way out of everything

   the way out bobs voice was full
of astonishment

   yes did i ever speak of a friend by
the name of deauvan-no i dont suppose
i ever did well no matter hes a man
we have known always-a coffee planter
he came to-day and we have talked for
hours

   yes there was quick jealousy in
bordens eyes but the girl was too intent
upon her theme to notice

   he has bought a plantation in mexico
and is going to build a railroad of his own
to transport his coffee to the coast well
she asked impatiently  dont you see
oh bob you are going to build his rail-
road i told him all about you your work
in the navy and he says you are the man
he wants we can be married at once and
go with him-

  borden interrupted her with gentle firm-
ness  but dear what on earth are you
saying its kind of him to offer this to me
-although of course he did it for you-
but naturally the whole thing is out of the
question

   out of the question but why-what
do you mean

   why nielsene dont you see im
not a free-lance engineer im in the ser-
vice-

   oh that you will resign of course

  borden looked at her and grew slowly
pale  resign my commission nielsene
do you realize what you are saying

   certainly  do its a way out of

everything why bob you dont think
for a minute do you that i ever had any
intention of permitting you to waste your-
self by remaining in the service and as for
myself i hate everything about it i
wouldnt be the wife of a man in the navy
for anything in the world the long sepa-
rations-rushing about into all sorts of im-
possible places to meet the ships- oh i
couldnt stand it 

  but dear you knew all of this-
surely we care enough about each other-
he kissed her with sudden anxiety  niel-
sene i dont know you in this mood

  the girl released herself  you say we
care she repeated slowly  i hope you
do-and i know i do i care enough to
make something of you why bob you
will be a big man in your profession i
know it-i feel it-and rich the salary
that deauvan offers is princely and you
will go on-

   no i will not go on borden inter-
rupted firmly  because i will never start
now nielsene lets talk this thing right
out

  the girl looked at him smilingly  very
well-but you talk

  borden disregarded her light tone he
went on to tell nielsene just what the ser-
vice of his country meant to him that
whatever he came to be was due to her
teachings he had received his instruction
at his governments expense for his govern-
ment and what he had learned belonged to
the service and could not be used to fur-
ther his own ambitions he finished by
saying resolutely that nothing would induce
him to resign his commission-nothing

  nielsene only laughed when he finished
but there was a metallic ring in her laugh-
ter

   what a child you are she said coolly
 and like a child you do not consider the
future and can see nothing but your own
point of view and you say you love me
and you told me that i was all in all to
you and that nothing should ever come
between us

   i am going to tell you something
bob she continued her eyes becoming
grave-something that nobody knows who
has seen the luxury that surrounds us the
	all-story weekly

ease of our lives things have not gone so
well for us since father buried himself in
his books-investments have proved unfor-
tunate-there have been two heavy losses-
altogether it is serious at any time a
crash may come-and then what so you
see what this offer really means to you and
me it is nothing that we can consider at
all discussing whether we will accept it or
whether we will not accept it it is some-
thing we grasp at once-and offer thanks
to the god of luck that it came our way
it means money sure money at once-

   nielsene money is not everything as
my wife whether or no you have money
your position will be the same-

   position childs prattle the only
position i want in this world is the posi-
tion that money will give me-that is real
position and i mean to marry a man
who can build me a throne of gold-and
hold it for me

   gold now nielsene it is you who
talk like a child what is gold that-

   the jingle of gold is the national an-
them of the world

   what a fanciful maker of phrases you
are dear and you listen to them and
convince yourself you are very wise
nielsene looked at him speculatively for
a long moment then swiftly she leaned
toward him and placed one cool hand on
his cheek

   we run in a circle oh dearest sup-
pose you go now-back to your ship and
shut yourself up in that tiny stuffy cabin
of yours- i pray you may not bake this
smothering night i fear i have put this
thing stupidly but when you are face to
face with it yourself-when that clear
brain of yours takes hold of it-pouf all
these fancies of the dreamer will float away
into the nowhere like gray mists of the
morning before the wind of the dawn no
-no-no not another word-please me
oh dearest

  borden rose he was still pale and
there was the shadow of great trouble in
his dark eyes  ill go of course-but it
wont change things it cant nielsene
she laid her soft cheek against his but
her eyes were as hard and cold as bits of
driving sleet

f

     la nuit porte conseil  she quoted
 and to-morrow is my name day you
will have dinner-here on the balcony-
with me alone we will be so happy-
and there will be soft candles and iced
cakes and chilled things to eat and drink
we will sit together afterward and i will
be sweet to you - ah how sweet -and
rodriguez will sing to us love-songs--and
we will watch the moon swinging in the
sky and be very quiet so that in between
the music we may hear the ripple of the
sea along the beach

   you draw a picture that goes to my
head

   yes good night dear and while
you are making up that so clever mind of
yours you will think of that picture

  borden held her hands and smiled down
into her eyes  dear i wouldnt dare

  borden walked slowly down the narrow
street to his ship but strangely enough
the proposition that nielsene had made
that night the offer she had given him was
the farthest thing from his thoughts he
had never considered it from the moment
she advanced it and there was no possible
chance of his ever considering it

  but not for a moment did he doubt his
ability to make nielsene see the question
from his point of view and it was mainly
this that kept his thoughts busy all that
night and the day following he would
take her in his arms after their dinner and
to the music of rodriguezs song tell her
that she must put this impossible dream
away forever - and he would masterfully
kiss away all her protestations

   then he shook his head  no ill have
to get it over the first thing he said  
have to know where we stand if i cant
make her see- he shut his eyes he
dared not consider this contingency

   nielsene in a marvelous creation of gray
chiffon gray like the waves of the sea un-
der a storm-cloud and with a sash of blue
as deep and vivid as her eyes wrapped
about her slim hips met him at the edge
of the balcony

  for a long moment he held her in his
arms and he found all his fine words had
deserted him all his convincing arguments
-and he was afraid
circe or ruth



   its no use he said quickly  ive
got to tell you now-i cant wait it would
not be fair nielsene i cant take that
offer i belong to the service and he
didnt try to hold her when she withdrew
slowly from his embrace

  she looked at the table spread with its
fine linen and glittering crystal her eyes
rose to where the moon cast a shadow of
dusky red through the thick foliage of the
mangoes she lifted her head with its regal
crown of golden braids and listened to the
sound of a guitar and a plaintive voice that
came from below the balcony not really
singing as yet only a fugitive note of ex-
quisite sweetness now and then as if the
singers heart was too full of music to be
silent then she laughed throwing back
her head her slim throat pulsating with her
mirth but there was no music in her
laughter and when she spoke her voice held
the ring of steel on stone

   i am amused-at myself she ex-
plained with the ominous calm the chill
of a frozen river creeping to the sea in her
voice she placed her slim hand on the
edge of the cloth with its heavy embroid-
ered lilies she caressed their petals with
her long fingers on one of which gleamed
a sapphire a magnificent stone as deep and
blue-and as coldly glittering-as her eyes
 i was thinking she continued  how
great a fool every woman is when this mad-
ness we call love sweeps over her it is
only a sickness of the heart after all yet
everything goes down before it-her reason
her calm her power of thought and she
never knows the man for whom she cher-
ished this delirium until she marries him-
and then it is too late well -she raised
her head and drew a slow deep breath-
 i thank whatever gods i have that i
knew before it was too late

   nielsene borden could hardly frame
the words his lips were stiff and his heart
was pounding until it threatened to smother
him

   do not think that i am reproaching
you i am not you are you-and i gave
my heart to the man i thought avas you
i made him myself-out of my own imag-
ination-and surely i could not hold you to
blame for that so now-she held out

her hand cool and smooth without a sign
of tremor in it -  we come to the day
when all things are clear when my eyes are
opened we arrive at the forks of lifes
highway-our roads divide good-by
and to borden at that moment came
the revelation that all arguments all ex-
planations even the soft words of lovers
would all be quite useless nielsenes words
seemed to crush his soul beneath an icy
weight

  two days later leonard kipp met niel-
sene and a distinguished gentleman of for-
eign appearance on the deck of the mail-
boat just leaving for manila she nodded
and stopped him with a smile

   i want to say good-by mr kipp she
said shifting her crimson parasol to the
other shoulder and extending her hand
 and-have you met my husband m
deauvan

  when kipp got out to his ship with all
possible speed he forced borden to open
the door of his room-after he had
knocked for almost five minutes but at
sight of bordens face everything he had
planned to say passed completely out of his
mind

   i know you mean this kindly leon-
ard borden said speaking with difficulty
and staring out of the port-hole  but i
dont want to talk about it-i cant

  kipp sat down on the narrow bunk and
put his arm about his friends shoulder

   you dont need to talk old chap he
said gently  ill attend to that and you
just sit and let me go on babbling even
though you dont believe a word i say you
are going through a pretty tough time but
remember this-you will go through wo-
men mostly are devils but some merciful
saint whispered in the almightys ear when
he was making men-to put some ingre-
dient in us that would help us forget the
hellish things they do to us and he
added thoughtfully  i am not so sure that
you really loved nielsene-

  leonard borden interrupted harshly
 oh all right i was just going to say
kipp persisted stubbornly  if it was mere-
ly infatuation-well let it go at that i
suppose one is as hard to get over as the
other


all-story weekly

  borden turned and faced his friend
ithere was death in his eyes  i am going
to tell you something about it-and finish
t up forever in quick jerky sentences
ill formed and often incoherent he told of
his break with nielsene harwich and as
much as he knew of her subsequent mar-
riage

   youre well rid of her kipp growled
savagely as he finished ill bet she mar-
ried that fat little french coffee planter just
for spite

  this had a startling effect on borden
 god you dont think that do you
leonard

    it would be just like her

   but- oh i dont dare believe it
to condemn herself to years-to marry-
poor nielsene and the blame is all
mine

  nothing of the kind kipp denied
alarm in his voice  and you dont need
to waste any sympathy on nielsene har-
wich-her kind dont need any shes a
cold-blooded money-mad heartless woman
and if anybody is going to suffer you can
bet it wont be nielsene he rose  now
you get right busy and concentrate every
ounce of your brain and will to putting
this behind you

  borden still stared into space  you
dont know nielsene he said  i think i
do-i love her you see that hardness
that glitter-it was all on the surface
underneath the real nielsene was capable
of great things and i let her do this thing
-i let her stifle forever the best in her i
should either have done as she wanted me
to or have made her listen to me why
did i leave her like that there must
have been some way there was every-
thing wonderful in nielsenes soul and 
couldnt reach it if i had only married
her-

   i wish to god you had kipp burst
out  in six months you would have
known nielsene thoroughly and have been
utterly sick of what you knew and then
when the break came-as of course it
would be bound to come-you would have
been free free absolutely now you will be
held by a dream of what might have been
you will feel you never knew-that there

was a nobility in that girl that she never
possessed nobility she doesnt under-
stand it when she runs into it

  youre wrong - absolutely wrong
when i held her in my arms-well there
were moments-

  moments kipp interrupted grimly
 yes there would be-with a girl like
nielsene but you can take it as truth
from me that these moments had little to
do with the nobility of what you are
pleased to call nielsenes soul

  two years went by and the men who
knew and loved bob borden told each other
that he was forgetting nielsene harwich
apparently he was the same except perhaps
he was a bit more silent was given more
to hours of dreaming by himself from
time to time he heard of nielsene every-
body did who followed the politics of a cer-
tain turbulent south american republic

  she had fallen into far deeper scandals
than belonged to her philippine days she
had long since left deauvan nobody knew
whether he had divorced her or not she
had gone to nicaragua and dabbled in the
troubled political waters of that unruly
country her name was mentioned in two
definite scandals and hinted at in half a
dozen others her jewels were famous and
the greatest artist in europe had painted
her portrait if these tales of the girl he
had hoped to marry affected bordon no-
body knew it

  it was almost two years after bordens
disastrous affair with nielsene harwich-
which leonard kipp always declared could
have been far more disastrous than it was
-that he had an attack of typhoid fever
and on his recovery left his ship in boston
and returned to his home on a two-months
leave bordon came from a small town up
in new hampshire and he hadnt been
back since he graduated from annapolis
as he stepped from the train at the neat
little station and looked about him he
could scarcely realize it had been that long
for nothing was changed

  it was june and the rambler roses were
in bloom creeping over the hedges and
piling in rosy falls of pink and crimson over
the gates and prim white picket fences
circe or ruth



the sky was blue and there was the clean
healing breath of the pines sweeping down
from the mountains

  everybody was glad to see borden the
town put aside its chill reserve and wel-
comed him whole-heartedly and borden
was glad of their welcome glad to be home
again he slept like a top in the old four-
poster bed under the patchwork quilt and
demanded doughnuts and currant pie and
the molasses cake that his mother was
famous for he tramped out into the
country where the bobbing hill was and
he rowed on the lake where he had hunted
water-lilies and learned to swim

  one day when returning with his mother
from a visit to an aunt who lived on the
edge of town they met a girl who stopped
with a smile that was vaguely familiar

  she was a little thing with a mass of
dark curls about her odd little three-cor-
nered face and soft gray eyes that danced
mischievously when she saw that borden
did not recognize her

   oh dont tell him she begged his
mother  we used to fight dreadfully
when we were little-

   but bob is a better boy now his
mother smiled  its ruth lavery she
went on to explain to borden  you must
remember her

  borden took ruths two hands and held
her off for a better view  certainly i re-
member her she was the worst little tor-
ment on the block she used to wear a
plaid dress with very stick-out skirts
which she used to flirt around the corners
after she had made a face at you her
sunbonnet was always white and always
hanging down her back

  ruth regarded him gravely although a
dimple danced in and out of her left cheek
 i was like that exactly and she con-
tinued severely  as to being a torment-
who used to snatch my books away from
me on the way from school who used to
throw snowballs at me and put black ants
on my arms at the picnics-and told cora
merril that i was too little to ask to her
candy pull i always held that against
you her eyes fell on her two hands still
clasped in his and she laughed as she re-
leased them

  she turned and walked up the street with
them when they came to the house mrs
borden insisted that she come up on the
porch and talk to bob while she got supper
but ruth laughingly said she cooked much
better than she talked- and walked right
out into the kitchen here borden was in-
itiated into the intricacies of making bak-
ing-powder biscuits and ham omelet

  later when ruth said good-by at her
gate she laughed up into bordens face
 your mother was right she said  you
are a better boy now a much better boy

   well i cant return the compliment
borden answered  because you were al-
ways-

   dont say i was nice ruth warned
him  because i wasnt i used to make
your life a burden and you must have
hated me but she explained brightly
 i was too young to know any better

  borden smiled down at her his eyes
sparkling with amusement  and now
time has remedied your youth he said

  as the days went on borden saw more
and more of little ruth lavery and
strangely enough she brought back to his
mind the thought of nielsene harwich
but now he found that he regarded niel-
sene from an entirely different angle ruth
was cool clear water to the thirsty after
surfeits of too sweet champagne she was
the tenderest song of the thrush after the
shrilly arresting notes of the mocking-bird

  is the love of a man always like a pendu-
lum i wonder does it always swing from
one extreme to the other

  something deep in bordens soul stirred
at the light in ruths gray eyes they were
the eyes a man could tell things to eyes
that would be kind-and understand and
his heart that he felt empty of the power
to care for another woman awoke to the
dawning of a different a deeper love

  the wedding was beautiful the church
was decorated with balsam and the pink
and lavender blossoms of the hydrangea
and the bride in her floating tulle dress
walked from the church under the high
crossed swords of bordens jubilant fellow
officers

  there was a brief honeymoon spent at
the edge of the canadian wilderness and


all-story weekly

then borden rejoined his ship a different
man-the old bob borden but instead of
the dreams that were always in the old
years just back of his eyes was a better
thing the clear shining light of ambition
ambition to do great things for the girl he
had married the girl who had slipped her
small hand in his and taught him to laugh
again

  he was as happy as he thought a man
could be he looked forward to ruths
letters he read and reread them treasuring
them carefully he counted the days to
their brief meetings and lived them over
again those precious hours during his soli-
tary watches at sea he dreamed of a fine
manly little son oh heaven was born
again for bob borden

  and then one night in the tropics he
came upon leonard kipp and tom jackson
sitting over their cigars in a corner of the
deck and the first words he caught halted
his footsteps as if they had rooted his feet
in the deck he listened with no thoughts
of intrusion too whirled on his own tossing
feelings to realize the shame of eavesdrop-
ping

   well of course i knew her at once
she is the old nielsene-harwich kipp was
saying  and beautiful-ye gods jack-
son shes a vision cold calm and state-
ly but with that old hint of hidden fires
as dangerously close as ever and she
hardly waited to get her greeting over be-
fore she asked about bob-everything
about him where he was how he was-she
fairly bombarded me with questions

   you told her of his marriage of course
what did she say

   she laughed jackson and such a
laugh like the crackling of frost on a
still cold night then she placed her long
white fingers on my arm and fixed those
bright cold blue eyes on mine

    do you believe she asked  that
dead loves ever rise from their graves i
could have cursed her to her face

  jackson laughed shortly  you must
have felt like the wedding guest when the
ancient mariner got hold of him

   i laughed at her kipp declared and
i said

    believe nielsene that there is noth-

ing so dead to a man as a dead love that
no matter what the call he never comes
back  

   i hope that held her for a while
jackson said

  kipp rose and stretched his arms above
his head  i would have been all right
only i happened to be lying about what i
believed and some day he continued
impressively that sleek-haired siren will
meet bob borden and she will hold out
her arms to him and call him  come back
to me do you remember nielsenes voice
at all jackson it was the call of the wild
all right and then some

  and borden turned without a sound and
went down to his room every nerve in his
body was tingling and he felt oddly shaken
why should he he hated himself for it
he sat down on the edge of his bunk and
tried to face squarely this absurd feeling
but instead when he closed his eyes a
picture of nielsene floated out of the mist
and smiled into his eyes he snatched up
his cap and returned to the deck he must
get away from himself find some one to
talk to

  well from that night a thought which
at first could have been no more than a
faint wisp of mist floating out of the past
began to take hold of borden imaginative
peoples thoughts may soon become obses-
sions and it was so with borden had he
not forgotten nielsene harwich was she
not buried deep-past all resurrection
how could a memory of a love that was
dead-as dead as if it had never been-
haunt him why should he fear he
didnt fearbut above his desperate de-
nial rippled the mocking notes of nielsenes
laughter and always she said  come back
-to me 

  ordinarily bordens emotions were as
shut up in his heart as the houses in his
home town behind their trim white picket
fences but things finally came to such a
pass with him that one night he confided
his troubles to leonard kipp he told him
that he had heard his conversation with
jackson on the deck a month ago and then
tried to discuss sanely and dispassionately
its effects on him

  kipp determinedly made light of it
circe or ruth



 youre overworked he declared  and
you worried too much about ruth when she
was sick last spring and you couldnt go to
her your nerves are shot to pieces your
imagination took hold of this thing and
now youre deliberately scaring yourself to
death

   deliberately do you think a man de-
liberately tortures himself as i have been
tortured these last weeks

   oh thats the trouble with you men
who dream you are slaves to your imagin-
ings stop thinking about the whole thing
youre like a man whos had yellow fever
worrying himself sick about whether hes
immune or not when hes caught in an epi-
demic that part of your life is over and
done with as far as you are concerned
nielsene harwich is dead

  borden shook his head  but she is not
dead and we are both wanderers and
lately i feel as if i am going to meet her
again

   oh forget it kipp stared curiously
at his friend  are you that afraid

  the knuckles on bordens hand whitened
as he held the rail  you didnt know
nielsene she was like some cursed witch-
flower whose perfume will never leave the
thing it has touched

   bob kipp said sternly  does it ever
occur to you that you are in no position to
be raving like this it isnt-square your
bark is anchored in the home harbor you
no longer have the freedom of the seas
all this -he hesitated- all this is rot-
ten of you

  borden pulled himself together  of
course it is he agreed after a moment in
a calmer voice  i guess you are right-
my nerves are playing tricks with me pie
smiled and held out his hand  im
steadier now old chap and-thank you
but kipp looked after him anxiously as
he walked down the deck then his eyes
swept the little harbor of palancia  the
world is so small he mused  well he
added with a shrug  i hope if bob ever
does meet nielsene he will have sense
enough to go while the going is good and
not wait for the fireworks but it would
be just like him to face it

  and later he told jackson that he wished

he had asked for shore leave and gone
ashore with bob no there was no reason
then he wondered aloud if presentments
were merely an old wives tale

  borden was turning away from the desk
at the hotel when he saw nielsene she
had risen from a small marble-topped
table near the door and was coming swiftly
toward him evidently she had been watch-
ing him for some time she was dressed
from head to foot in the whites of the
tropics some sheer stuff heavily em-
broidered that hugged her silken ankles
and almost concealed the square ivory
buckles on her white slippers under the
wide flaring brim of her lace hat her bright
hair lay in shining folds against her white
white neck

  she held out both her white slender
hands they were bare of rings except for
a magnificent sapphire on the little finger
of her right hand it was square cut and
flashing with blue fire

   bob she exclaimed  i am glad to
see you-and so surprised when did you
get in

  this morning borden took her hand
and stood looking down at her kipp had
been right times finger had touched
nielsene harwich but to caress her-her
philippine days might have been yesterday

   and you stay-how long nielsenes
voice was friendly but only that there
was no circes song in its cool depths only
the pleasure of one who meets an old and
valued friend

   i dont know how long we will stay
bob answered we came in to coal

 oh yes i remember now i was talk-
ing to the governor general this morning
and he said that you would be here a week
then-why i will see you--many times
 i dont know-my duties-

  nielsene nodded with swift comprehen-
sion  yes i know and then too there
have been so many things planned for you
i expected to leave the city to-day-the
heat you know so -she held out her
hand- it seems to be  i greet you-and
we part thats an old danish folk-song
i used to sing it in the dead days do you
remember

  borden nodded  yes i remember it


all-story weekly

-was a beautiful song he added thought-
fully

  nielsene clasped her hands over the gold
handle of her parasol  do you know
now that i have met you i dont want to
leave there is so much to say-

  borden suddenly fixed his dark eyes on
hers  what is there to say nielsene be-
tween you and me

  nielsenes lashes fluttered down over her
blue eyes  you are right she sighed
 what is there to say-between you and
me and her voice was as sweet as honey
dripping from a rock

  suddenly she smiled one of those aston-
ishingly fascinating transitions of hers
 come she begged  i go out of your
life-perhaps to-morrow-and you too are
but a bird on the wing what can it mat-
ter one brief hour she leaned forward
and talked rapidly  its a wonderful
place she finished  perched high up on
the rocks miles above the city like the nest
of an eagle we can dine there and watch
the lights flare up in the city like stars in
an earthly sky afterward-good-by a
long good-by a real one-a good-by that
means forever what do you say-yes

   i am sorry but its impossible and
borden had said good-by and was half-way
down the veranda of the hotel when some-
thing within him made him pause why
did he run away wasnt it better to face
this thing now-to get it over with-and
know once and for all whether he was a
mean-spirited thing who depended upon
flight to keep him out of danger or a free
man free to come and go as he liked with
no shadow of memory the dream or the
reality to mock his security he turned
and deliberately retraced his steps niel-
sene was standing where he had left her
she might almost have been waiting for
him

   you have changed your mind she
said at once  you will go i am so glad
now i wonder if you can find my car out
there its bright blue with a silver run-
ning gear

  borden found the car a small showy
thing but with a powerful engine and
slowly they climbed the steep hill that rose
behind the city to the little cafe that hung

over the bay and seemed to laugh mock-
ingly at the waves that dashed against the
rocks hundreds of feet below

  nielsene sat opposite him and resting
her chin on her interlaced fingers regarded
him out of deep blue eyes

   you have changed she announced at
last  but the change is a good one-and i
like you so there is more purpose in your
eyes the set of your mouth is stronger al-
though your smile is the same but you
dont smile so often tell me -she leaned
forward lifting her blue eyes to his- do
you find me changed

  borden regarded her long and steadily
his eyes took in every feature of her face
the broad low brow with the sweep of
warm golden hair above it the wide eyes
as deep and as richly blue as the sapphire
on her finger the finely chiseled nose and
the soft-lipped red mouth with its insolent-
ly curved upper lip the woman watched
him intently fearlessly lifting her beautiful
face to his

   no you have not changed-at all
borden said at last  you are still beauti-
ful do you know nielsene he added
reflectively  i dont think i ever saw a
woman as flawlessly lovely as you are
nielsene nodded  i am like my mother
and perfect fair women are rare and we
do not change-women like me for years
we are the same our eyes are bright our
lips still retain the color and texture of
youth our bodies remain young and sup-
ple but then-pouf like that all in a
breath it is gone back to where it came
from

   still the fanciful fashioner of phrases
arent you nielsene borden smiled
watching her intently through his cigarette-
smoke

   and you do not like it time was
when you called it dream-weaving-fairy
tales that you loved to listen to

  borden laughed lightly  of course i
like it it adds piquancy to what you say
and few women possess the gift but i in-
terrupted you where does all this witching
beauty go

   to the regions of the inferno-need i
tell you that she added daringly she
swayed forward and touched his hand fleet-
circe or ruth



ingly with the tips of her slim cool fingers
 we are the devils daughters-women like
me father always said that-exotic
flowers of the nether world we blow and
bend to the wind of fate we are lovely to
look upon but fatal to touch and calamity
falls upon those who breathe too deep of
our perfume my father was something of
a poet you know and often talked great
nonsense but often too there was truth
in what he said we are passion flowers he
said and we live on love

   borden gave her a brief glance and
 turned away  and would you call it-
 love

    nielsenes eyes deepened and became full
  of the soft mystery that lies in the heart of
  a moonstone she waited white hands
  clasped in front of her until bordens eyes
  returned to her

     and you she questioned meaningly
  you loved me-once what would you
 call it

    there was a long moment of silence in
 which the booming of the surf on the rocks
 below came faintly to their ears

   borden looked at the woman opposite
 thoughtfully he shook his head  i dont
 know nielsene he said after a moment

     i have called myself many things in my
  time nielsene said infinite weariness in
  her voice  but never until to-night have i
  called myself a fool she leaned forward
  until the perfumed lace on her sleeve fell
  across his wrist  oh why-why did i
  ever let you go

     why will you women persist in delving
  into the past with useless questionings
  fie lifted his shoulder restlessly  is it
  ever wise

     and when was i ever wise nielsene
 questioned mockingly then she abruptly
 pressed her fingers to her temples  when
 i think of what i had-and what i lost
 and i did love you-yes i did although
 afterward- she checked herself with an
 impatient gesture and the ring on her finger
 flashed blue fire  do you know bob
 that in the life of every woman like me
 there is one good man you are that man
 with me but i was so young when you
 came the dreams you brought me were
 beyond my understanding and i tore your

     	a-s

ideals with careless fingers she stopped
and spread her hands with their white
tapering fingers upon the dark cloth of his
uniform-sleeve  they are pretty hands
are they not soft and white and they
look as if they might be gentle if you had
kept them fast in yours bob who knows
there might have been different writing
concerning nielsene harwich in the big
book i wonder-do you

  he did not answer her why was he si-
lent on this question hung the end of
things for bob borden-or the beginning

   do you never think of me nielsene
persisted her fingers closing upon his arm
- never

  borden was still silent his cigarette
had gone out in his fingers and his eyes
were fixed on the harbor lights

   bob listen to me nielsene smoked
furiously for a moment and then tossed
her cigarette with its outlandish-looking
crest over the railing  some time-fight
it off as long and as hard as you like-but
some time the memory of me is coming
back to you when a woman loves a man
as i love you when she thinks of him
dreams of him when her thoughts travel
the wide world to find him -she bent for-
ward swiftly and pressed one hand on each
side of his face so that he must look at her
- some time i say they will find him
you need not look at me are you afraid
of my eyes i wonder you may keep your
gaze fixed on the riding lights of your ship
down there with a smile on your lips but
i know the truth of what i am saying

   i was your first love-i mean to be
your last i wont let you forget me

   other fromen-another woman-may
possess you for a while but deep down in
your soul you know the best of you your
youth belongs to me and your heart will
grow hungry for the fulfilment of our
dream bury the memory deep if you
will but you cannot bury it so deep that it
will not rise some day and come seeking
me

  somewhere down on the steep slopes that
lay between them and the city was a strag-
gling native settlement here and there
the lights of the huts could be seen set like
jewels in the black velvet darkness a wo-


all-story weekly

man began to sing down there softly but
with now and then a sweetly crooning note
that floated up through the silence of the
tropical night

   a love song nielsene sighed

  but borden shook his head  even i
know better than that and i do not under-
stand the words of her song but it is the
same as a hundred others that are being
sung at this hour just after sunset by wo-
men of every creed and color in the world
it is a lullaby-and i can hear its echo in
my own home a thousand miles away

   and what of me there was almost
a sob in nielsenes voice

  borden laughed into her eyes  you
will go on as you always have-what is one
man to you even should he give up
everything in life that counts-faith honor
and decency-to follow you to the end of
the world it would only mean to you that
another victim had listened to your song
you see circe i know you better-now
he nodded as the blue eyes flashed into his
 oh yes you are still beautiful your voice
is still full of music and you still talk with
a charm that is quite your own but to me
-you have lost your poetry i could not
love you-if i would

   and my dreams-they mean nothing to
you then

  borden carefully extinguished the glow-
ing end of his cigarette  nielsene he
said gently  dont delude yourself with
impossible dreams they are dangerous
things dreams they dutch you with fan-
tom fingers of unreality and sometimes it
takes months of suffering before you can
free yourself-convince yourself that they
were but ghosts that you conjured up in
your own mind of something that never
was he stopped and breathed deep of
the cool night air v i know but to-
night-ah to-night i set my sails to the
sky and laugh that they ever held me at
all

  for a moment nielsene looked at him
her blue eyes wide and her slim white
hands clasped tightly across the lace of her
gown then she bowed her head and
laughed lightly

   good-by i give you leave to go

   you are not coming borden asked in
surprise

   no she pointed to the horizon
where the moon was rising  ill sit here
and try to pierce the veil of thanet

  at the head of the stairs borden turned
he clicked his heels sharply together and
lifted his white cap high above his head

   good-bv nielsene-and good hunt-
ing

the girl with the hoe

llice stopped hoeing rested on the
hoe and wiped beads of perspira-
tion from her forehead

   whee its hot she said

  it was hot though the sun was slipping
toward the west its rays still beat down on
a dry earth as if they fiercely desired to
wither all vegetation there was no breath
of air stirring the corn which alice stood
among was so still that it seemed as if it
would never rustle pleasantly again

   however said alice  ive stirred up
what there was

  what she had stirred up was not a breeze
but the earths moisture lying beneath the
crust which the heat had baked hard
alice was a pretty good farmerette and
she knew that when there is no rain you
must keep the old hoe busy if your crops
are not to die so for three weeks she had
resorted to capillar attraction to save her
plants

  it was not a big garden in which she
stood but it was a very well tended one
the rows of corn and potatoes and cab-
bages and tomatoes were straight and if
there had been a weed among them alice
would doubtless have got out a warrant
for it

  alice didnt have to make a garden in
fact alice-or so she believed-didnt have
to do anything that she didnt want to do
her father dying a few months before had
left her more money than she could have

squandered in a eon or so but the year
before while the war was at its crisis she
had with many another young woman of
wealth and refinement gone to the country
to help out the hard-pressed farmers

  there she had learned the rudiments of
farming she had found that growing
things had a fascination for her so the
next winter she studied soils and fertilizers
methods of cultivation all the what-to-
grow-and-how-to-grow-it literature that she
could lay her hands on-and when your
purse is deep and never empty you can lay
your hands on almost anything so this
year in a plot in the rear of her suburban
home she was a farmer in her own right

  in the country she had learned that dig-
ging in the soil has any tonic beaten a
whole section she ate and slept as she
said like a horse the phrase was not hers
she had picked it up in the country
though the farmers should have known that
a horse is not an especially good sleeper
and that he can very easily overeat how-
ever alice had never felt so fit so that a
bit of misplaced language made no differ-
ence

  she had learned another thing and that
was that air and wind will produce a beauty
which shames cosmetics she had always
been a pretty girl slender graceful dark-
the usual thing in brunette good looks
but the first night she had togged herself
out in her customary habiliments on her
return home she had stood in front of her
glass and stared at her reflection

   by gosh she had said reverting again




all-story weekly

to rural idiom  there is something to me
now there is certainly something to me

  certainly there was something  to  her
and she was not referring to avoirdupois
it was an olive face which looked out from
the glass-a face whose cheeks flamed from
sun and wind her lips were scarlet even
her nose seemed to be more shapely but it
was the eyes which at last held alice they
were bigger she was sure of that and she
was right alice hadnt an ounce of super-
fluous flesh on her anywhere the face
which had been plump before was now
thin with the thinness of sweet health
thus the eyes were larger and bright
they shone and sparkled in the light from
above the dressing-table alice had fled
from their gaze in a moment because she
confessed she was afraid she might get to
thinking too well of herself but she
hummed as she went down-stairs

  the verdict of the glass was made unani-
mous by the men she knew and they would
have made an army corps before she had
farmeretted she had been popular as any
wealthy pretty girl cant help being but
it was a mild sort of popularity men
danced with her and paid her compliments
quite in the ordinary way

  but she soon found herself the storm-
center of many desires she had been pro-
posed to many times but mildly she was
too keen not to know that these languid
swains wanted her a little perhaps and her
money a whole lot now however she
couldnt escape being aware that men were
ready to fight for her for the first time in
her life she was looking into mens souls
where the elemental things were stored
more than once she had quietly lifted her
eyes to refuse a man and had been shaken
by the passion which she had seen in his
eyes

  and she soon realized that if ever the
right man came along be he rich or poor
she would respond to him with a tempest of
emotion of her own she did everything
harder than she had ever done it before
and if she came to love at last she would
as she insisted upon phrasing it treat it
lightly for the time being love at high
speed

  the man had come in the person of one

henry matteson he was a lawyer-a
rising young lawyer so people said alice
saw him four times after that he might
have been a lawyer or a bribe-taker it
would have been all one to alice she
would have married him if he had come
clothed in rags on his wedding morn

  fate was kind however and the good
fairies were on guard matteson was every-
thing he should have been except that as a
usual thing he was a little shy of cash

   get it soon he said  used the bit
i had to acquire a legal education costly
business nowadays

  he dropped his pronouns because he had
proposed just a moment before and his
heart was pounding so that speech was
difficult but alice had seen that he wished
her to understand his financial situation

   nothing like that matters she had
said and she might not have said it if she
had never been a farmerette if she had
never been energized by the outdoors

   you mean- he asked

    yes said alice

  and so as alice stood in her garden at
five oclock on this afternoon she was an
engaged young woman it was because she
was an engaged young woman that she had
stopped hoeing when you are clad in
overalls with a blue handkerchief round
your neck and a battered straw hat on your
head and you are barefooted just to feel the
earth on your feet and your sweetheart is
due at half past five-

   whee said alice now  ill have to
hustle if he ever saw me like this hed
get a divorce before he married me

  matteson had been in a dangerous condi-
tion all along it is probable that if he had
seen alice like that with smudges on her
cheeks but with lips gleaming and eyes
shining he would have expired immediate-
ly he must have known that so glorious a
creature was not for him

  alice ran to the house hoe in hand she
stood the hoe against the side porch and
went into the kitchen the old colored
cook knew that something flew past her
and she guessed it was alice in the din-
ing-room alice almost upset the house-
keeper but the housekeeper was a good
sort and didnt mind
the great burmese



 alice reached the bottom of the stairs
 still going strong she was half-way up
 when her maid appeared at the top

  bath ready alice asked

 the maid did not speak at the top of
 the stairs alice stopped abruptly she had
 not abandoned all her old habits and she
 did not care for maids who did not reply
 maids who just stood and stared at you as
 if something were the matter

  what is it alice asked frigidly

  there is a man in the library waiting
 to see you the maid said then

  good gracious said alice  hes
 ahead of time

  it isnt mr matteson miss the maid
 said  its a strange man-a very strange
 man

 alices nerves were so steady now that
 you couldnt startle her or scare hfcr easily

  whats strange about him she asked
 with her acquired directness

  his eyes the maid answered simply

  what do-you mean by that

  theyre so dark and so bright and
 shine so-wicked eyes miss

  he asked to see me alice asked

  yes miss

  i suppose i shall have to see him
 alice said  go down and tell him ill give
 him just a moment-in about twenty min-
 utes

  he said that he was to see you as soon
 as you came in

  where did you say i was

  i said you were out i didnt like his
 looks

  what was his manner was he in-
 solent

  polite but-ah-stubborn miss

 stubborn what do you mean by
that surely you didnt argue with him
oh no why i mean that he seemed
to be used to having his own way and he
said he was to see you the minute you
came in

 alice saw that if she interrogated the
 maid any further the latter would only go
 over the same ground alice supposed the
 man had frightened the girl by his abrupt-
 ness well she said he had his nerve
 but no she mustnt talk like that the
 slang of the corn-field and the potato-patch

 which she used only to herself but which
 had amused her vastly when she had
 listened to it the year before sufficed per-
 haps in its place this was a situation
 which demanded dignity shed go down
 to meet the man

  we never know how far-reaching our ex-
periences are alice thought she under-
stood perfectly how she had been benefited
by her life in the open but she only guessed
at the benefit her memory was no longer
than that of most people

  as she retraced her steps down the stairs
it did not occur to her that a year ago she
would have waited for mattesons arrival
and have had matteson deal with the in-
truder she had come now to a point
which by subconscious decision she
handled her own emergencies shed see
just what the gentleman meant by assum-
ing that he could dictate the time at which
he could meet her she had little time but
if he were not too obtuse she might con-
vince him that he could only request and
not demand an audience with her

  in a moment she stood in the door of the
library a man was seated by a table mid-
way of the room she had arrived sound-
lessly but he perceived at once that she was
there for a moment alice had forgotten
her workaday costume but the stranger ap-
peared to find nothing grotesque in it in-
deed he seemed not to be interested in it
at all

  he rose with slow grace

  alice saw a man six feet tall he was
not slender precisely but there was no sug-
gestion of largeness about him in any par-
ticular the word  compact  flashed
through alices mind she had a fleeting
notion that he was heavily muscled -prob-
ably he was very strong

  and then she noticed his eyes they
were very dark and brilliant but they were
not uncertain eyes as are some dark bril-
liant eyes they fixed themselves on her
face unwaveringly alice had a curious
sense that he did not wink at all the
eyelids seemed rigid

  and then the girl did a curious thing
she said in a little hushed voice

   youre a foreigner are you not

  the man smiled it was not a cynical


all-story weekly

smile nor was it quite mirthless but it
was cold icily cold and it was a thing of
the lips alone it did not change the im-
passiveness of the face nor lend itself in the
slightest degree to the eyes

  the man seemed to become a little more
erect the smile faded as swiftly as if he
controlled it by an electric switch he
bowed

   you wished to see me didnt you
alice asked

  she had put out a groping hand and the
hand now found the door-casing alice
steadied herself with the contact again
the man bowed

   will you tell me your business

  the man spoke abruptly then but his
voice was low and soft

   i come to tell you that you are not to
marry mr matteson

  again the girl put a curious question

   what is your nationality

   i only wish to say that you will not
marry him

   and you-are you- the girl faltered
 and that is all the man said  i will
bid you good afternoon

  he took up his hat which had been lying
on the table beside him and moved toward
the door blocked by the girl she took
two quick steps forward and two sidewise
so that he might pass without coming near-
er to her than necessary

  he passed her paused now his tone
was deferential

 you will accompany me to the door
he passed into the hall and the girl fol-
lowed him into it and along it at the
outer door which opened on a screened
porch he stopped

   i have left my card on the library
table he said

  he opened the door quickly bowed low
passed through the door crossed the porch
opened the screen door and descended the
steps the girl stood looking after him to
ascertain whether he would look back he
did not he climbed into a car which
stood at the end of the drive and sped
away in it

  the girl cast an apprehensive glance over
her shoulder no one was in sight

  site fairly ran to the library and through

the library door she slammed the door
shut and leaned against it the color had
gone out of her face now it was still dark
from her tan but lifeless her long lashes
drooped over her eyes she shivered

  she stood thus for five minutes then
she lifted her head and listened matteson
must be almost due she had to get her
ordeal over with before he arrived he
must not see her in this condition but she
could not command herself till she had
looked at the strangers  card she quot-
ed the word in her mind she knew it was
not an oblong of pasteboard which lay there
on the table

  in her subliminal mind she knew that she
was giving thanks for the new glad strength
which had blessed her but with all her
conscious mind she was using that strength
to raise herself to an erect position even
when she had gained that she could not
see what her staring eyes sought a pile of
magazines intervened she brought herself
to the very tips of her toes but with no
better success she took a forward step

  the sense of movement banished her
hesitation she sprang to the table

  the card lay there in full view she
snatched it up as if it had been a living
thing which menaced her and flung it from
her across the room

  then she felt herself slipping toward the
rug she caught at the edge of the table
a scream rose to her lips but before she
articulated the scream she slipped into
blackness

chapter ii

missing

henry matteson was a man well
blessed by the fates he had abun-
dant health- had never been ill a
minute in his life he said his desires
were normal as great a blessing as can
come to any man for booze he had no
use-didnt care for it according to his
own statement he wanted a competence
a home a wife children he had the will-
ingness to work for the competence and the
brains to carry him to it without exhaust-
ing effort
the great burmese



  he was not a handsome man but he had
a strong frank face good eyes and a chin
that was square beneath a full firm mouth
he said he was as sound as a nut and to
himself admitted that he would take on any
man he had ever met-if he had to

  till he had met alice wendell he had
gone straight along doing the things which
he wanted to do and getting the results he
wanted to get he was kind and courteous
without effusion men liked him and he
liked men if they played square with him
he himself always played square to the best
of his ability

  he admired good women and had been
moved by one or two but he had never
been sufficiently hard hit till he had met
alice then characteristically he did not
stop to consider that he was poor and she
was rich he might never be rich but he
would have his competence he supposed
that any good woman who loved a man
would be satisfied with that in which he
was quite right

  as a rule he was a very punctual man
and he was annoyed this hot afternoon as
he speeded his car toward alices suburban
home his car was not much of a car it
had apparently never had a good home and
it made its owner safe from prosecution on
a charge of breaking the speed laws

  just now he was urging it and coaxing it
to its utmost but the poor thing could do
no more than it could do and at last he
just settled back and let it take its course
getting as he always tried to as much out
of the things to be seen as he could

  as a lover will he had overestimated his
tardiness when he stopped in the drive
alongside alices house he was twenty-one
minutes late the exact computation was
his own

   thats bad enough he told himself as
he hopped down  but it might be worse
guess alice  forgive me this once

  it never occurred to him that he might
shield himself behind any one of the auto-
drivers subterfuges hed just tell her
right out that he had remained in the office
on the off chance that a possible client
might drop in hed gamble that shed not
ask him if he preferred the company of a
possible client to her own they under-

tood each other those two young people
and got along finely together as they both
agreed

  he rang the door-bell confidently and he
was not taken at all aback when the maid
said that miss wendell was engaged in the
library he said he would just sit down
out there on the porch

  the maid moved to retreat matteson
being a very observant young man saw her
start and pause she stared into the drive

   well she said  thank gawd hes
gone

  as a rule she was a rather well-trained
maid in ordinary circumstances she would
have cut off her right hand before she would
have permitted mr matteson to hear her
use such language but when youve been
thrown off your balance and then have a
sudden and unexpected emotion of relief
youre likely to say almost anything

  matteson noted the tone he sensed im-
mediately that there was an unusual situa-
tion here any unusual situation in alices
house was something for him to step right
into

   whats the matter he asked  what
do you mean whos gone

  the maid was confused because of what
she had said her training dropped from
her as if it had been a loose garment she
flushed and avoided mattesons direct gaze

   ill tell miss wendell youre here sir
she said  ill tell her right away

   of course said matteson for he dis-
liked to press questions on alices maid

  the girl fled matteson stood in front
of the screen door waiting he had no
notion that anything serious had happened
at worst alice might have been annoyed
in that case he wanted to see her at once
he would promptly and efficiently take care
of anybody who annoyed her he flexed
the muscles of his right arm with a sense of
his ability to do that

  and then there was a womans scream
within the house whatever alice had
been the maid was not inarticulate when it
came to sounding a vocal tocsin

  the screen was still echoing when mat-
teson tore open the screen door and burst
through it

   where are you he cried


all-story weekly

  the maid staggered through the door of
the library matteson ran to her steadied
her to a chair with one hand let her slip
into the chair and sprang to the library
door

  on the floor by the table alice lay
supine motionless at first matteson
thought she was dead with his blood
turned to ice he wavered over to her and
dropped beside her on his knees he
touched her cheek and found it warm her
pulse beat regularly beneath the finger he
laid upon it at her wrist

   thank god he breathed

  he gathered her up in his arms and sat
down in a chair which stood behind him
he held her as he might have held a child
he murmured endearing names softly
quietly so that when she wakened he would
communicate no new alarm to her

   for several long minutes she did not stir
she just lay in his arms and breathed
through parted lips then her eyelids
seemed to shiver her lips quivered she
took a deeper breath

    i-i threw it into the sea she said

  her words were distinct but no more
she added

   that should have been the end of it
that should have been the end of it

  then she opened her eyes

  matteson forced a smile to lips which
were somewhat unsteady

   did you faint honey he asked

  for ten seconds she regarded him with
eyes in whose depths terror lay then she
relaxed against him

   henry she whispered  give me a
minute here its so real

  love flamed in him but he would not
take advantage of her

   sure he smiled  take your time
these infernally hot days are likely to put
a person out just like this worked in your
garden too long toppled over i see

  alice began to cry a rain of tears and
he let the rain fall he knew that no mat-
ter what had happened tears were the best
for her

  at last she stirred and he let her slip
from his arms to her feet and then holding
her rose and put her into the chair he had
occupied

   want anything dear he asked
 glass of water

  she nodded with closed eyes he went
to the door without sign of haste but
quickly

   glass of water he told the maid

  he spoke in his usual tone but he
caught the girl up with his eyes and so in-
formed her that she must forget her non-
sense and be about her business the look
appeared to steady the girl she rose and
in a moment was back with the water
matteson knelt beside alice and held the
glass to her lips

   now ill send the maid in he said
still with his warm smile  then you must
rest a while just rest dont think a
thought about old me ill be kicking
about the place somewhere when you want
me maybe ill have a look at the lil ol
garden

  some color had come back to alices
cheeks she rose she saw that matteson
was going about the business of restoring
her to the exclusion of everything else he
let no curiosity interfere with this he
offered the excuse of hot weather if she
wished to take it she might take it and
that would be an end of the matter except
that he would be a little tenderer than usual
with her if that were possible

  she looked into his eyes and then she
suddenly threw her arms about his neck
and kissed him as she had never kissed him
before

   youre the finest man beneath the sun
henry matteson she said

  still matteson would not take her off her
guard

   thats what everybody says he
laughed  run along now and rest
youre getting stronger every second

   youll wait for me she whispered

   till the stars grow cold he assured
her

  whatever her trouble was his love en-
veloped her it was that love which was
strengthening her unquestioning loyalty
might save a sinner or ennoble a saint she
was neither she was only a very human
girl and it might have been that she drew
more from his affection than either sinner
or saint would have drawn
the great burmese



  at any rate after a long loving scrutiny
of him which he withstood smilingly she
withdrew and there was no uncertainty in
her movements

  matteson went out on the porch sat
down and lit a cigarette the sun had
set by now and there was a suggestion of
breeze from the direction of the lake but
there was no coolness in it it was merely
the hot breathing of the dying day

  when he had smoked his cigarette mat-
teson got up and went down on the lawn
he walked about there for a few minutes
and then he wandered back to alices gar-
den the corn had lifted its many heads
as if it sought the vagrant breeze and there
was a faint rustle among them

  if matteson had been a different sort of
man that whispering of the corn might
have been symbolical to him but there
were no whispers in his mind he trusted
the woman he loved

  but he wondered about the man whom
the maid had spoken of his keen brain
sought a connection between alices faint-
ing spell and the mans visit the man
must certainly have done something or the
maid would not have  thanked god  that
he had gone

  matteson thought of alices father
there had been rumors about him before
his death hed been a queer combination
matteson recalled or at least people had
seid he had been a queer combination mat-
teson had paid little attention to the talk
as a lawyer he knew that most men-and
most women for that matter-are queer
combinations

  wendell had made his own money but
he was not the typical self-made american
people said that in some ways he had an
astonishing education which he had dug
out of books for himself he had been n-
terested in indian lore - or was it hin-
dustan matteson couldnt remember

  there had been a story about a trip
which he and alice had taken to some east-
ern country he had come back from that
trip ill and broken his death had followed
shortly after his arrival home he seemed
to have a leaning toward mystic things-
had a  bug  on them matteson had sup-
posed but again there was nothing

strange in that most very practical men
had bugs on something or other

  well in her own good time alice would
tell him about all those things if their tell-
ing was worth while

  he returned to the porch the maid
came out with a tray of sandwiches and
cold tea matteson ate all the sandwiches
and drank all the tea

  he lit another cigarette and leaned back
in his chair the stars were out now and
the full moon was edging up above a pur-
ple velvet band in the east the world
was silvered over in a tree near matteson
an owl uttered its tremulous evening cry
and far back of the house a whippoorwill
began to snap out its mandate

  some time before long said matteson to
himself alice and he would be sitting to-
gether like this man and wife shed be
sitting by him there all in white dim
ethereal

  and then quite wonderfully to him she
was there all in white with flowers at her
waist-silly old-fashioned flowers that she
had grown herself

  he stood up and she came into his arms
with lifted face but the lips which his
own touched were cold

   did you rest he asked

  she slipped down into a chair behind her
he leaned over her

   i couldnt rest she answered

  an indefinable terror struck at matte-
sons heart then something was the mat-
ter the last time he had been with her
she had been warm palpitant buoyant with
health now she was cold subdued seemed
ill he felt the same gentle consideration
for her which he had felt before but he
had to know something

   dear he said  tell me what you can
as i arrived this afternoon the maid
thanked god that a man had gone who
was the man

   just keep on as you were this after-
noon she beseeched him

  he knelt beside her and his arms en-
circled her

   you know how it is with me he said
 id ask no questions except for one
thing you might need help if you didnt
care to tell me anything in the way of en-


all-story weekly

lightenment you might just tell me what
to do

   you cant do anything she said

   you mean no one can

   of course

   you know my questions arent idle
what caused you to faint

  she did not answer as he had paved the
way for her to answer that the heat had
been the cause she sat mute

  an echo of what he had pondered in the
garden came to him as sharply as that far
bird uttered its whipping cry

   was it something concerning vour fa-
ther

  she shivered in his arms for a while
still she did not speak then she said
abruptly

   dont ask me about my father dear
i saw him changed from a robust man to
a wreck almost overnight i saw him die

  he too became silent she was suffer-
ing and he was helpless he was helpless
in spite of the fact that he would have died
for her fought in her defense till he gasped
out his last breath

   youll just have to trust me she said

   oh trust you he breathed

  she would go no further and he could
not urge her on he rose and drew a chair
to her side he put his arm about her and
her head fell wearily to his shoulder

   i am tired she said at last  ill
try again to rest to sleep if i can

  he left her regretfully holding her hands
in his and letting them slip from his slow-
ly he stood bareheaded while she went
into the house

  he went down to the old car and drove
noisily away when he thought the sound
must have died from her hearing he ran
the car to the roadside and stopped he
descended from it and made his way back
to the house there was a big row of trees
on the opposite side of the road and he
sat down in the shadow of one of these

  his conscience hurt him he felt as if
he were spying on her and yet what could
he do a strange man had visited her
she had fainted he had a growing feel-
ing that a danger which was not quite tan-
gible threatened her the thing to do was
to make it tangible at whatever cost

  undoubtedly it was a matter which con-
cerned her father she might be trying to
protcct his name she had no right to sacri-
fice herself in an effort to do that oh
hed give a good deal to get his hands on
the man who had visited her hed get at
the bottom of the thing then you bet

  he sat there under the tree for a long
time the big house was dark no light
showed anywhere he thought every one
must have gone to bed he didnt know
what to do

  and then he saw two dim figures coming
down the drive he could not distinguish
their features but he made out that one
was a man and one a woman he rose

  there was no throb of jealousy in his
soul he was not afraid that alice was
clandestinely meeting some one for any evil
purpose his only thought w-as that he
was going to lay his two hands on the man
who had visited her in the afternoon

  then he had a swift and ludicrous reac-
tion the two figures had emerged into
the moonlight one of them was that of
the maid the other matteson inferred
was her fiance at least for her peace of
mind he hoped so

  he turned his back while they made their
good-byes in the shadow of the trees-across
the way the man hurried off down the
road the girl stood looking after him
when he was out of sight she turned toward
the house

  matteson stepped into the road

   here my girl he said

  the girl wheeled about matteson
crossed over to her swiftly

   its matteson he said  my car
broke down theres a wrench in the tool-
house ill get it ev the way is miss
wendell resting i was afraid to-night
that she was going to be ill

   do you wish me to find out the girl
asked

  a vague and nagging worry had been in
mattesons mind he wanted to make sure
before he left the house that alice was
safe it seemed rather silly to stay on
guard all night he couldnt keep a con-
tinued vigil if he were reassured he
would go home and see alice in the morn-
ing
the great burmese



   i wish you would he said

  the gir was gone five minutes at the
end of that time she came hurrying toward
him along the drive

   miss wendell isnt in her room she
said  and as far as i can make out she
isnt in the house

chapter iii

the second stone

matteson fully realized now why
he had come back to the house in-
stead of proceeding to his own home
when he had left in the afternoon

  looking back he could see that he had
feared some such calamity as this but
where had alice gone and how had she left
the house without his seeing her had she
known when he left her that she was going
away doubt flickered through his mind
but he quenched it stoutly no he would
not be that kind of lover he would trust
her to the end

  he was a man of action and he thanked
god that action seemed to be needed here

  he would have liked to assume a casual
air to make the servant believe that he was
not alarmed but that was a kind of hy-
pocrisy and with hypocrisy he had never
had anything to do he was not a good
enough actor to be a hypocrite besides
he didnt know that anything was to be
gained by concealment

   well search the house he told the
maid  go around and turn on all the
lights dont be agitated but keep call-
ing miss wendells name she may have
been in a room in which you have not
looked and have fainted hurry

   i-im afraid the girl whimpered

   ill go with you matteson said

  they went into the house and searched
the lower floor matteson kept calling
alice oh alice where are you

  this brought no response from the girl
but it roused the housekeeper and the old
negro cook they came down-stairs mat-
teson explained what had happened

   when did you see miss wendell last
he asked them

   i havent seen her since she went out

on the porch in the evening the house-
keeper said

   ah aint seed huh sence this after-
noon the old colored woman stated

   and you matteson asked the maid

   not since she came in from the porch
the maid answered  she said she didnt
need me and i-i went to the kitchen

   thats all right matteson said kind-
ly remembering that the girl had a love-
affair of her own

  he pondered alices dismissal of the
maid there was something irregular in
that alice had been unstrung half ill
in those circumstances it would have been
natural to suppose that she would require
the services of her maid if she ever had re-
quired them it was a suspicion-rousing
incident matteson could only make up his
mind that alice had been intending to go
away all the time he had been with her

  he could place the pieces of the puzzle
so that they seemed to fit now but whether
he got the correct pattern of the whole he
could not tell alice had had a strange
visitor she had received a shock the
man must have conveyed a startling mes-
sage to her he must have requested her
to meet him that evening he must have
held some sort of threat over her

   you three go over the up-stairs he di-
rected  ill wait here

  the competent housekeeper a woman of
avoirdupois and good nerves assumed the
lead they mounted the stairs and mat-
teson waiting heardthem moving back
and forth up there

  they came back in ten minutes

   she is not in the house the house-
keeper said  besides her motor-coat and
a veil are gone from among her clothing

   when were they there last matteson
asked

   this morning the maid answered

   she wasnt out in her car to-day

   not to-day

   no one called here after i left this eve-
ning of course he said

   no one the maid answered

   was there a phone call for miss wen-
dell

   there was a phone call the house-
keeper answered  it was about half an


all-story weekly

hour ago i didnt know that miss wen-
dell had come in when the bell rang i
started for the library before i got to
the door i heard miss wendell say  hel-
lo

   she hadnt gone to bed then

   i suppose not she must have been
sitting in there

  to himself matteson said  she must
have been waiting for that phone call
strange aloud he added  did you hear
what miss wendell said over the phone

   when i heard her voice i withdrew
the housekeeper said rather frostily

   of course said wendell absently
 well have a look at the library

  they went into the big room and mat-
teson stood looking around nothing was
disturbed there was the same order here
as there was throughout the house the
bookcases the long table the leather
chairs were just as he had seen them a
hundred times

  it struck him that alice might have left
a note

  he walked over to the table and exam-
ined the things upon it but there was no
note there was nothing

   you might as well go to bed he told
the women  i will remain here possibly
for the night they withdrew

  matteson sat down before the table he
heped of course that alice would return
but he had no feeling that she would do so
her absence created a void he had a
sense of increasing loneliness if he had
had a touch of mysticism in his nature he
would have said positively that she would
not return

  that filled him with bewilderment he
had never experienced such a sensation be-
fore he rose and paced the room

   she has gone some distance he told
himself and he pressed his hands to a fore-
head suddenly grown hot

  he returned to the chair and sank into
it with a shrug of his big shoulders

   nerves he said aloud  and no
wonder 

  but that thought pressed in on him it
was like a mental tugging at his sleeve

   but if i left here he asked himself
again aloud  where should i go

  there was no fact to take hold of and
he realized that that was his trouble he
had been on guard and alice had somehow
slipped by him as if she had been invisible
she had garbed herself for a motor ride
had she got the car out of the garage

  in other circumstances he would have
laughed at himself for his next step but
he could laugh at nothing now in a few
hours a perfectly strong healthy normal
girl had changed into a fainting and then a
distraught one then she had vanished
that was the way he phrased it alices
going was not a disappearance it was a
vanishing such things didnt happen in
his matter-of-fact legal world where there
was a law for everything

  he rose and went out to the garage it
was locked but through the window he
could see that the car was inside

   of course he said

  he stood for a few moments in the
scented moonlight head bent he never had
any difficulty in picturing alice to himself
in her absence from him and he pictured
her now he moved her before his minds
eye as if she were a figure on a slowly re-
volving screen

   she lay there on the floor of the library
in her working clothes sweet grotesque
little figure altogether lovable she passed
through the door of the library she came
to him on the porch always there was an
aura of love for himself about her it
seemed to shine about her even in these
pictures he was making but she had been
-just what

  she had been controlled that was what
she had been he remembered now that her
buoyancy was gone it was as if a spirit
had stood beside her but a spirit which had
the power to keep a heavy fleshly hand
upon her shoulder

   hell  matteson ground out  im get-
ting nutty she was ill i tell you

  he argued aloud as if some one besides
himself were there

  he raised his head and looked about him
the moon was almost over his head now
full-orbed a great silver shield in space
the world lay still beneath it the beauty
of the scene penetrated to mattesons in-
most soul
the great burmese



   ive got to find her to-night he told
himself

  he returned to the library there was a
silver bell on the long table and he struck
it sharply

  almost at once the maid appeared in the
doorway  did you ring she asked

  she was red-eyed and pale matteson
felt sorry for her and that touch of human
feeling quieted him he was his normal
self instantly the girls emotion was sim-
ple and natural it was something which he
could understand and sympathize with
alices emotion had been one of terror he
realized then that about terror-feminine
terror-he knew nothing that was why
he had had those shivery moments

  the thing to do was to keep normal not
to entertain a thought which was not based
upon the sound good sense which was his
dearest possession

   i rang he said quietly  sit down
dont be frightened

  the girl sank to the edge of a chair

  she did not wait for him to question her
she began to speak rapidly

   that man gave me a shivery feeling
he kept staring at me his eyes were black
they werent just black eyes like people
sometimes have not natural black eyes
they werent natural at all and he never
moved them he didnt seem even to wink
and you couldnt tell from looking at him
what he was thinking about that was the
worst of it

   dont you know sir you can tell what
people are thinking about you most of the
time if you give them a good look in the
eyes you can tell whether they feel kindly
toward you or whether they dont like you
or whether they think you are a good person
or a bad person dont you know what i
mean sir

  matteson nodded he would give her
rein

   but this man he just sat and looked
sometimes i felt as if he didnt know i was
there and then i felt as if he was-was-

   going to tell you to do something-
when he had made up his mind about you
and about the thing that he wanted you to
do matteson suggested  you wanted to
run away from his eyes

   i knew i should run away but i
didnt the girl answered simply

    how was he dressed matteson asked
  the girl looked at him blankly

   i dont know she answered  i only
remember his eyes-and that his face was
kind of sallow

  was he an american

   no he wasnt he was some kind of a
foreigner

  matteson knew that it would be useless
to try to establish the mans nationality
through the girl he forebore questioning
her along that line because her answers
might confuse him what he gathered from
her he wanted to be based on fact

   tell me about his arrival and depar-
ture matteson said

   the bell rang i answered it this
man was standing beyond the screen his
eyes took me first he said

    i will come inr

   before i could do or say anything he
just opened the door and pushed past me
he told me to take him to the library i
did he asked me where miss wendell was
and i said out he said he would see her
the minute she came in and that was all
matteson leaned forward in his chair and
stared at the rug in his helplessness a
blind raging desire to lay his hands on
brilliant eyes possessed him there was
the sound of a sob he looked up the
girl was crying her handkerchief to her
eyes

   what is it matteson asked rather
impatiently

  the maid removed the handkerchief

   dont be angry with me she whis-
pered  i havent told you everything

   in heavens name what else is there
matteson asked  come now im not
going to hurt you or say anything to you
to wound you but if you have any clue
in this crazy business let me have it

  the girl fumbled in the pocket of her
apron and drew out a second handkerchief
she unfolded this and a brilliant stone rolled
out into her hand she passed it to mat-
teson matteson held it in his hand and
stared at it

  matteson was not sure but he judged it
to be a great uncut sapphire


all-story weekly

   where in the world did you get this
he asked

   i found it here in this room after you
and miss wendell had left this afternoon
the maid answered  i came in to see if
miss wendell had dropped anything and i
noticed a jagged hole in the wall youll
see its over there

  matteson rose and walked to the end of
the room he found the hole he placed
the stone in it and found that it fitted he
turned about to the maid and shook his
head in new bewilderment

   what does it mean he asked

   i dont know the maid answered  is
it valuable sir

   if its a genuine jewel its valuable
matteson answered he looked at her
keenly  never mind he added  you
say nothing about this and neither will i
we are all tempted at one time or another

   i-i never stole before the girl pro-
tested  i-i was going to be married and
--and-

   you havent stolen yet matteson said
 go to bed now and say nothing about
this say nothing about anything

  apparently glad to be let off so easily the
maid scurried away

  matteson being a lawyer had to discount
her testimony now he knew that since
she was a thief at the time she had testified
she would make her testimony to him as
interesting as possible doubtless she had
romanced the gentleman with the brilliant
eyes the man was probably no more than
a smooth crook who went about intimi-
dating women

  but if that were so how had he got
alice to leave the security of her home
how above all had he persuaded her to
keep a secret from the man she loved

  and there was the stone he sat with
it in the palm of his hand staring down at
it he was sure alice had not owned such
an uncut jewel if jewel it was it was a
curious thing to be owned by any one but
a lapidary if alice had owned it she
would have mentioned it to him

  as he sat thus staring at it there was a
premonitory click from the telephone mat-
teson straightened up with a jerk

  the bell whirred

  he snatched off the receiver and put it
to his ear

   yes he said eagerly

  there was no immediate response but
somehow matteson knew that some one was
at the other end of the wire it was a kind
of breathing silence which he waited in

  and then without preliminary cough or
clearing of throat came over the wire a
smooth clear even-controlled voice

   an uncut sapphire is the sign

  the circuit was clicked shut

chapter iv

the third

matteson jiggled the receiver up
and down on the hook impatiently
till sleepy central answered she
 didnt know who had called him she
would connect him with the supervisor but
the supervisor didnt know and matteson
hung up the receiver in dismay

  he looked down at the gleaming stone
again so it was a sapphire and it was a
sign he tried to recall some knowledge of
sapphires which he might have picked up
in the past but he had none the only
jewel which had ever interested him was the
diamond which alice wendell wore on her
engagement finger

  there was crookedness in the whole thing
somewhere he could see but it was a
strange crookedness what sort of criminal
was it who went about giving away sap-
phires as a sign a sign of what evil
certainly but evil to what result

  he stayed on in the house turning these
puzzling questions over in his mind day
broke with a red sun giving promise of
more stifling heat the servants came
down-stairs

   i am going back to town matteson
told the housekeeper  there is nothing i
can do no there has been no word of
miss wendell during the night i havent
the slightest idea where she is when i
get to town i shall go directly to my office
if there is any development of anj kind
call me on- the phone there

  he scribbled his office phone number on
his card and left he found his car where
the great burmese



he had left it when he got to town he
went home and bathed and had his break-
fast then he went to his office he
entered it at half past eight

   anything up he asked his clerk in
the outer office

   there was a man here to see you
wouldnt state his business said he would
leave a message for you on your desk said
you were expecting him

   know him

   no a strange fellow some sort of
foreigner chinese or something i think
matteson paused with his hand on the
knob of his private-office door

   just what did he look like he asked
rather thickly

  the clerk looked at his employer rather
curiously usually matteson was the pic-
ture of well-groomed health this morning
he seemed pale and a bit unsteady the
clerk wondered if he had been  out  the
night before the clerk knew as the world
knew that matteson was engaged to the
wealthy miss wendell perhaps she had
 given him the shake

   why he was very smooth the clerk
said  pulled a lot of the courtesy stuff
bowed to me as if i were a woman spoke
low kept looking at me steadily queer
eyes seemed all pupils looked as if he
might be a dope fiend

   howr was he dressed

   ordinary clothing some kind of a light
suit straw hat

   all right matteson said

  he went into his private office and closed
the door even before he looked at his
desk he knew what was lying there he
took off his coat the heat having become
suddenly very oppressive and hung up it
and his hat	c

  then he sat down at his desk

  a sheet of note-paper wrapper some
object lying there matteson picked it up
through the paper he could feel the rough
edges of an uncut stone he opened the
paper and took out another sapphire

   a man could get rich playing this fel-
lows game he said grimly

  he smoothed out the paper half expect-
ing to find a written message on it but
there was none

  matteson was not a detective he was
a lawyer who gave his time to civil matters
he knew he would butt his head against a
stone wall if he tried to solve this mystery
unaided

  he went to the door and opened it

   call police headquarters and see if
detective jack doyle is in he directed
 if he is ask him if he can give me ten
minutes of his time at once

  the clerk took down the telephone re-
ceiver matteson closed the door

  in his own office he went to the window
and stood looking down into the street
he saw that the man he was dealing with
had at least unlimited nerve he wasnt
afraid to appear in the homes and offices of
the people he was  after

  matteson could not decide whether he
had been foolish in summoning jack doyle
to his aid if his office was under obser-
vation doyles arrival would be noted and
doyle would be what might be termed a
 marked man if he were so marked
matteson wondered whether doyle would
be a recipient of a stone there would be
grim humor in that doyle was honest but
poor- one of those sapphires would fill his
purse

  the clerk knocked on the door and said
that doyle said he would be right up mat-
teson was glad of it he would not long
have to argue as to the wisdom of summon-
ing doyle and he had a notion he would
feel better when he had enlisted doyles
aid

  doyle was no great criminal catcher he
was a policeman who had graduated into
the plain-clothes squad but he had been
a good friend of mattesons in the past he
would loyally do what he could and he
would keep his mouth shut besides he
was a painstaking policeman and he knew
every criminal of note who had ever worked
in the city unless the criminal had got
away clean

  doyle arrived within a few minutes-a
red-faced man a little out of breath beads
of sweat on his forehead

   what can i do for you mr matteson
or what are you going to do for me he
asked  either way im at your service
i wouldnt mind turnin up something good


all-story weekly

its dull not even a robbery and a get-
away to keep us on our mettle

  there was something reassuring to mat-
teson in the presence of the homely police-
man there was nothing odd about doyle
he was all man physically and he was all
man mentally so far as his mentality went
he was clean and sane and honest-all of
which was a good deal when one was up
against the machinations of a brilliant-eyed
stranger who was elusive and mysterious

  so matteson decided to tell doyle all he
knew

   know anything about stones he asked
in conclusion

   paving stones doyle said  lemme
see one of them rocks or better both of
em

  matteson handed the stones to him

   they look real pretty doyle said
 but i dont know what theyre worth
not much id say a gink who would go
about strewin jools would be bugs wouldnt
he

   i have no doubttthis fellow is bugs
matteson said

   thems the worst kind doyle said
and that held little comfort for matteson
 you take a sane man and you can figure
a little bit what his next more is goin to
be but you take a nut and all hell cant
tell how hell run hes just as like to lie
down in the meadow grass and snooze or
hes just as like to jump offen the highest
bridge he can find

  iknow a guy over on second street
that can tell a real stone from a bogus one
he isnt a nice man to deal with as a rule

i	been layin for him for years but i aint
got him yet i will though you just take
one of these things and send it over by
your clerk and tell the clerk to tell this
gink that jack doyle sent him no send
both of them pieces of glass one might be
good the other might be phony heres
the number

  he wrote the address on a piece of paper
matteson summoned the clerk matteson
handed him the sapphires with doyles in-
structions

   hold one of them in each hand and let
him look at them there doyle said  if
you let them out of your sight they might

be real when he took them and phony when
he handed them back

  when the clerk had gone doyle led mat-
teson over the whole affair again step by
step

   im wearvin you i know doyle said
 but thats only because you didnt sleep
last night and because you are worried
you keep right on tellin me about this
even if you do repeat yourself

  matteson talked on in endless repetition
it seemed to him he watched doyles
square face for some sign that the police-
man saw something which was hidden from
matteson for a long time there was no
such sign doyle only sat leaning one thick
arm on the desk now and then he wiped
sweat from his face

  and then all of a sudden he straightened
up

   repeat that again he said

   -i threw it into the sea she said

   now tell me about the finding of the
stone that this gink left with miss wendell

  matteson described the finding of the
stone omitting mention of the maids at-
tempted theft

  doyle wiped a particularly heavy dew of
sweat from his forehead

   well he said  we got a line on them
sapphires anyhow miss wendell threw
that stone just before she fainted i dont
think she really knowed that she was throw-
in it i guess it was what the docs would
call a reflex you know about that sure
you do

   well then this stone must have give
her a shock she had throwed something
into the sea what did she throw in the
sea well when she was down and out
she throwed one of these jools when she
was cornin to she wasnt quite all there
mebbe her mind was travelin back to some-
thin that had happened before what was
that why these two stones are the second
and third there was a first she throwed
it into the sea

    i-i throwed it into the sea says
she

   association of ideas huh

   its logical matteson had to concede
 but where in the world did you pick up
all this jack
the great burmese



  jack had the grace to blush

   it aint my stuff he said  i borrowed
it from sheldon the bertillon shark up to
headquarters im hangin round his place
when i aint got anything else to do hes
a wiz on that what-dye-call-it-stuff-about
the mind-

   psychology

   yeh that stuff hes told me a book
full and ive remembered mebbe half a
chapter if i had an education i could pose
as a-sherlock and get away with it but
this sheldon guy is better n sherlock ever
dreamed of bein

   now ill tell you mr matteson this
girl and her father had been to-where
india yeh he was nuts on that mystery
stuff lots of them go that way ive
saw limousines in front of the shop of a
clairvoynt who wore a red kimona with
grease spots on it

   well miss wendells father got mixed
up with some of this here dope and there
was a sapphire in it as a sign and they give
him the indian third degree whatever that
is and he couldnt stand the racket and
his daughter brought him home to die and
on the way she throwed the sign into the
sea

   them foreigners has plenty of jools as
a rule there was a foreign prince in this
town once on a visit and he had a bushel
of them thats how it happens that this
brilliant-eyed gink can go strewin these
here jools around and not mind the price
ill bet a new hat that they are genuine
youll see when your man comes back

  well in the mean time well get a
good manon the job ill just use your
phone to call up sheldon and have him
hop over here hes busy but if i say
this is something unusual he will come a
runnin you listen to his flow of language
this phone

  matteson nodded

  doyle took up the phone and called
headquarters sheldon said he would come
right over with a camera to take finger-
prints

   hell get this guy located if hes ever
been mugged doyle said  hell know
him before another sun sets

  sheldon came presently matteson had

    	a-s

expected to receive a serious high-browed
superpoliceman whose manner would show
that he didnt exactly dislike himself

  the man who came was rotund and red-
cheeked he had lazy blue eyes and he
never seemed to stop smiling

  and so they sat down three normal men
to consider what seemed an abnormality
sheldon listened while matteson told his
story over again

  when he had finished sheldon leaned
back in his chair and lit a terrible pipe
even as his lips closed about the stem of it
they did not cease to smile

   whats your theory jack he asked

   doyle played a repeater for his benefit

   sounds reasonable sheldon said
 but why mr matteson do you suppose
miss wendell would want to keep this
thing a secret from you of all men

   i cant tell you matteson said

    pier father is dead she is alone in the
world

   yes

   except for you

   except for me matteson conceded
with a flush

   she is a particularly loyal sort of
girl

   very

   the kind said sheldon gently  who
would give herself to protect the man she
loved

  good god matteson said starting
up  you dont imagine she went away
willingly with this man in order to protect
me from some peril real or imaginary

   she went away sheldon said quietly
 and the man left you a sign as he calls
it everybody seems to have noticed this
mans eyes-enlarged pupils i should say
changing eyes of any hue to black bella-
donna probably uses it internally too
its done once in a while rare dope to
be used that way though we find strange
cases nowadays since the drug-restriction
law went into effect some one at the door
mr matteson

  the two other men had been so intent
upon what the bertillon expert was saying
that they had not heard two knocks on the
door

   come in matteson called


all-story weekly

  the clerk entered

   here said doyle with pardonable
pride  is where i dont buy a hat for mr
matteson

  the clerk put the two  jools  on the
desk he turned to doyle with a little
smile on his lips

   your friend said you neednt have been
so particular about instructing me to keep
those things in my hands he said  he
said he wasnt quite that cheap yet he
told me to tell you that they were silica
greenish rock-crystal he said if youd
come in person hed possibly lend you fifty
cents on them

chapter v

a night visitor

hat do you make of that
matteson asked sheldon while
doyle sat looking at the stones
disappointedly

   nothing except that those pieces of
glass are a good deal cheaper than real
sapphires would have been sheldon re-
turned with a smile

   ah its hocus-pocus doyle said  i
think that this is a case that calls for a
little rough work one thing mr matte-
son wherever you go from now on till this
business is cleared up im goin to be on
your trail ill arrange it with the chief
here i go and build up a beautiful theory
and its knocked into a cocked hat you
aint got no friends that would be playing a
practical joke on you have you

   miss wendells disappearance isnt a
joke matteson said  she wouldnt be a
party to a joke that would keep me in sus-
pense like this

   well thats a fact doyle conceded
 well i got my lay and ill follow it
what you goin to do sheldon

   follow the usual procedure sheldon
answered  will you take us out to miss
wendells home mr matteson

   my car is down-stairs matteson
said  come on

  they drove out to the wendell home
sheldon first went over the house bringing
up at the library here he produced a

camera and made photographs of the places
which the strangers fingers might have
touched  now that maid he said

  matteson rang the bell and the maid
came in answer

   have you dusted this room since yes-
terday sheldon asked

   no sir the maid answered  ive
been so upset-

   its all right sheldon assured her
 a good thing now tell me all about
the man who called to see miss wendell
the maid repeated her inadequate de-
scription sheldon took up each several
statement when she had finished and by
close questioning made her embroider it till
not a detail was lost

  thats all he said and the maid
withdrew

    i dont  make  this man at all shel-
don told matteson  i dont think hes
ever come under my observation and he
certainly doesnt work like anybody we
know does he doyle

   no doyle said  he dont its poor
stuff though mystifyin to my way of
thinkin he aint got a thing but nerve
so far as i can see

   hes undoubtedly an intelligent man
and under the hypnotic influence of dope
has developed a rare cunning and courage
they will do it and weve got to look out
for the unexpected he may do anything
 you think miss wendell is in danger
then matteson asked

   i dont believe that she is just yet
sheldon answered  this fellow is going
to make another play before long that
play will undoubtedly involve you doyle
will go to work on the case he says the
best thing you can do mr matteson is
to wait for the next move

   its awful to be idle when miss wen-
dells situation may be almost anything
matteson said

   even in police work patience is a vir-
tue sheldon said  youll just have to
take hold of yourself and wait id suggest
that you go to your office and spend the day
as usual from there go home doyle
could give you a man to stay with you
but that might delay developments i take
it you have nerve yourself
the great burmese



   im not afraid if thats what you
mean matteson said

  they went back down-town and matte-
son returned to his office he spent the
day there but nothing happened as he
was leaving doyle called him on the phone

   nothin doin eh doyle said  well
youre goin right home

   yes matteson said

   good enough said doyle and rang
off

  matteson went home and had his dinner
which he had sent up from the kitchen of
the apartment-hotel in which he lived
after he had eaten a little he had the dishes
removed and stretched out in a chair to
ponder on his unhappy situation

  he had not thought he would sleep he
had never seemed more wide awake but
he was unused to losing rest and sleep
came to him swiftly he stretched out a
little farther in the reclining chair sleep
swept over him

  he awoke with a start even in his
somnolent condition he wondered about
that ordinarily his waking was a slow
lazy stretching process

  he sat up in the chair and rubbed his
eyes unconsciously his hand reached out
for the electric-light switch then he came
wide awake

  when he had gone to sleep the lights had
been burning who had turned them off
he started to rise and then there was a
movement behind his chair

  i am here said a deep resonant
voice

  matteson had a feeling that the voice
would match those brilliant eyes which the
maid had spoken about

   well what do you want matteson
asked

   the great pleasure of your company on
a short trip and then on a long trip a very
long trip

   youre the gentleman of the sapphire
tendency are you matteson asked sar-
castically

   i am

   wheres miss wendell

   safe-in the place whither you are
going

   whither-hell matteson ground out

 youre putting on a good deal of side
arent you

   will you go in peace the voice asked

   ill think it over matteson answered
in a changed tone  just give me a min-
ute

   the dawn is two hours away the voice
said  we have time

  matteson was surprised that he had slept
so long he reproached himself for having
rested so well while the girl he loved was
in danger

  he was playing for time now by means
of the mans voice he had placed him as
standing directly behind the chair close to
it matteson was trying to figure out just
how he could reach the man in one spring
he raised his head cautiously and looked
about him

  there was no light in the room be-
cause his income was not large matteson
lived on the top floor he was beyond the
glow of the street lights

  but he knew just where every object in
the room was there was nothing between
him and the stranger

  he edged a little forward on his seat
gathering his legs under him for a spring
which would cary him around the side of
the chair he expected every second that
the man would speak again telling him he
was wasting time but he seemed to be a
fellow of infinite patience

  crouching matteson listened for a sound
of his visitorsbreathing but there was no
such sound there was no sound of any
kind in the room

  then matteson his right hand grasping
the arm of the chair sprang and swung
round all in one movement he was behind
the chair his hands wildly groping for the
stranger but the hands met nothing

  i am not there said the sonorous
voice  i am here

   here matteson knew was beyond the
curtains hanging between the sitting-room
and the dining-room matteson ground
out an oath he would have sworn the
man had not moved

   i was there only in the voice the
stranger said

  a shivery sensation went up and down
mattesons spine


all-story weekly

   whatre you talking about he de-
manded

  he expected the man to laugh at his
discomfiture but evidently that was some-
thing quite foreign to the mans nature
laughter matteson supposed was too hu-
man a thing for him to indulge in

   a voice obedient to the souls whim
the man pursued

  matteson wheeled about expecting an
attack the voice now had come from
the other end of the room opposite to the
place where the curtains hung

  there was no attack there was no
sound even with a hand which was
suddenly somewhat unsteady matteson
reached out and snapped on the lights he
was alone in the room

  but there was a movement of the cur-
tains and the voice said

   i am here in the flesh

   show yourself then matteson chal-
lenged

  the curtains swayed-for theatrical ef-
fect matteson supposed he waited

   you are a conventional man the voice
said  i shall have to use conventional
methods to make you obey--at least for
the present i am armed i am here

  he stepped forth and stood looking at
matteson matteson was not surprised
now that the maid had seen only his eyes
they were big eyes perfectly black and
amazingly brilliant

  matteson stood looking into them for
a moment and then he swiftly scrutinized
his visitor he would memorize the details
which had escaped the others

  the mans face was sallow there were
odd splotches of faint purple on it his
nose was big and his mouth wide the
lips were colorless but they were not un-
steady as matteson expected they might
be

  the man was conventionally dressed in
a dark suit and wore a modest tie straw
hat and black low shoes except for his
face and his eyes he would have escaped
observation anywhere

  in his right hand he held a pistol and
matteson saw that he held it in a loose
familiar way as if he were perfectly at
home in the use of firearms

   what next matteson asked angrily
 if youll put down that gun ill knock
your head off id just like to get my
two hands on you for a moment you go
about preying on women frightening them
youre a spineless pup

   and now we will go the stranger
said smoothly

  matteson saw that there was no good
in railing at him in calling him names
he seemed impervious to abuse his face
did not change expression and his brilliant
eyes did not move from mattesons face

   go where matteson asked

   to far countries to places men rarely
visit least of all white men to inner
temples-to shrines until you are ini-
tiated

   into what

   as wendell was the man said imper-
turbably

   what happened to wendell matteson
demanded  what broke him what in
fact killed him

   he threw his talisman into the sea
the man answered  she threw it into the
sea it is a fatal acts

  unconsciously matteson thrust his hand
into his coat-pocket the stones came into
contact with his fingers he clutched them
and drew out his hand in a sudden fu-
rious burst of anger he hurled the stones
straight at his visitors face but swift as
light the man moved his head the stones
struck the curtains and fell to the floor

   we will go he said

  he pointed the pistol full at mattesons
breast he seemed to lose some of his im-
passiveness his eyes did not change they
could not grow brighter than they had
been but the purple splotches on his face
grew more distinct

  matteson believed he had a madman to
deal with he took up his hat from the
table upon which he had tossed it

   go ahead he said grimly  but ill
bet you ten dollars ill get you before we go
far

  the man stepped into the room

   behind you he said politely

  matteson passed through the curtains
with the man at his back they went into
the hall and the man closed the door
the great burmese



   the elevator isnt running matteson
said  well have to walk

  ill be just behind you with the pistol
in my coat-pocket the man said  pray
do not attempt to escape the consequences
to you would be dire and i should regret
violence

  they went down the four flights of stairs
and came out on the street encountering
no one at that hour

  a car with the curtains down stood at
the curb the man unhooked a front cur-
tain  get in he said

  matteson stepped past the wheel and sat
down the man climbed in beside him
with one hand he pressed his pistol into
mattesons side with the other he fas-
tened the curtain then dexterously he
started the machine guiding it with one
hand

  so they rode speaking no word the
stranger was like a statue except that now
and then his lean hand moved to turn the
wheel slightly he did not look at matte-
son his eyes were fixed straight ahead
of him he continued to press the pistol
into mattesons sidt

  the man seemed in no hurry he did
not speed to all appearances the car was
taking its occupants about some leisurely
business once matteson saw a policeman
on the sidewalk before a half-lighted store
but the policeman did not even look in the
direction of the car

  smootharent you matteson sneered

  the man made no answer except for
the pistol pressing into his side matteson
might have thought that his captor was
unaware of his presence

  they passed out of the residence district
and came to a long paved road matteson
saw with a start that it was the road which
led out to alice wendells suburban home
he wondered if the man was taking him
there if he was alice might be there and
might so far be safe

  he voiced that notion the man again
did not answer

   tell me one thing you hell-hound 
matteson ground out  is miss wendell
safe

   safe for the present-till the moment
arrives

   a-a-rgh matteson grunted in disgust
and he was tempted to turn in his seat
and grapple with his enemy but he swiftly
saw the futility of that

  he had observed that the man had
extraordinarily long-fingered hands one
index-finger was now wrapped about the
trigger of the pistol matteson had seen
with what indescribable swiftness the man
could move if he so much as stirred in
a way to rouse the faintest suspicion he
supposed that long brown finger would
press the trigger

  he stared straight ahead of him as his
companion was doing

  they rode perhaps a mile then of a
sudden matteson felt a jab like that from
a needle in his leg he winced and start-
ed he glanced down at the hand which
held the gun but apparently the hand had
not moved

  in a few minutes he began to grow
drowsy his head went to his chest but he
shook himself awake drowsiness came
back swiftly he reviled himself for being
sleepy on an occasion like this when so
much was at stake but his eyes closed
and his head drooped again

  again he shook himself awake he un-
derstood the meaning of that jab in his leg
now

  he reached out to seize the man beside
him but his hands dropped helplessly be
fore they could reach their object

   doped me he muttered thickly
 you-you-

chapter vi

               weird

he revived to a sense of motion for
a moment he sat in complete dul-
ness pie was conscious of a burning

thirst

   water he muttered 

a glass was instantly held to his lips

   drink friend said a womans voice
he tried to raise a hand to take the
glass which was pressed against his lips
but he found he was securely bound he
bent his head and drank the water as the
glass was tilted


all-story weekly

   who are you he asked

  there was a low laugh a pleasant con-
tralto laugh a garment silk matteson
thought rustled and matteson knew he
was alone

  he lifted his head and stared about him

  he was in complete darkness save for a
patch of light at his left he saw as his
eyes became more normal that the patch
of light was a window perhaps two feet
square beyond that there was more light
dim flickering uncertain light a land-
scape was rushing past him

   im on a train he muttered again
 where the devil are they taking me and
wheres the porter that was a woman
am i awake

  he struggled against his bonds but they
held him he looked from the window
once more still the landscape rushed by
he closed his eyes and tried to reverse
that motion often while riding in rail-
road trains he had seen the train suddenly
stop and the landscape appear to move
but he had been able to rectify the mo-
tion by closing his eyes when he opened
his eyes now however the landscape still
whirled by

   were going like the devil he said
 ill say that much

  suddenly there was a crash of thunder
and the sound of rushing wind

   storm said matteson dully

  he knew that he was not yet free of the
drug which the man had injected into his
veins his mind was sluggish and he only
half realized what was taking place he
felt as if he wanted to sleep again

   porter he called  oh porter
where the devil are you

  but there was no answer this seemed
to be a train without conductor or porter
there was only the woman who had held
the glass to his lips

   where is that woman he cried
j silence

  he gritted his teeth and tried to bring
his mind back to normal but he felt al-
most as if his reason were toppling on its
throne his situation was sufficiently ter-
rifying again he felt that jab in his leg

   he struggled violently cursing

  dont put me to sleep he cried

 free me and let us meet man to man
thats all i ask man to m-

  his voice died on that letter his head
dropped to his breast again and he slept

  he awoke to nausea he waited for
that sense of motion again but it -didnt
come without his asking for it a glass
was again held to his lips he gulped a
sour drink and the nausea passed he
found that he could move his arms they
were unbound

  he tried to rise but discovered that his
legs were bound from hips to ankles he
stretched out his hands and they-came into
contact with what appeared to be dry
grass though he was in utter darkness
now he believed he was lying on a sward

  suddenly the darkness was shot through
with an unearthly light it came with a
flash hung trembling for a moment and
then disappeared but it revealed to mat-
teson long avenues of trees with some sort
of building at the far end of them

   where am i he yelled  what
place is this-

  his only answer was a shrill whistle of
wind across his body it passed and
seemed to die away in the trees he sat
staring at the spot which his eyes had been
focused upon when the light had disap-
peared

  now there was a tiny spot of light there
a mere white speck in the blackness the
speck grew widened and rounded pres-
ently there was an illumined space

  into this space a womans face and bust
were at once projected it was a beautiful
face in a barbaric way it was large but
well molded the lips were extremely red
and the eyes were black and surrounded
by long heavy lashes the red lips curved
in a seductive smile and the face disap-
peared

  it disappeared but it was instantly re-
placed by another face and that was the
face of alice wendell

  matteson cried out her name but there
was no response from her matteson saw
that her face was pale beneath its summer
tan and that her eyes were dosed from
the position of the head matteson judged
that she was reclining buthe could not see
what her head rested upon
the great burmese



  then the ghostly light widened and grew
till her whole body was revealed she
was dressed all in white as she had been
when matteson had last seen her on the
porch of her home he leaned forward
and stared at her his lips dropped apart

  for though alice wendell was reclining
her body rested upon nothing the light
revealed her fully now and there was
nothing beneath her nor above her she
seemed to float in space

   is it not well o stranger said the
voice of the man who had forced matteson
from his apartment

   ill kill you for this matteson ground
out

  that was the only thing he could think
of to say his mind was whirling between
reality and unreality but he still had a
healthy desire to get his fingers on the
mans brown throat hed bet hed throt-
tle him till his tongue hung out

   what are you going to do with that
girl matteson added

   she is held as hostage you are held as
hostage till she frees herself of the dross
of wealth

  there was a gurgle of feminine mirth a
deep contralto gurgle beyond the man

   oh said matteson savagely  youre
holding us up are you clean case of
robbery if you can get away with it but
the police  have you before you can go
through with this or i miss my guess

  he had thought of doyle and of doyles
promise not to lose sight of him doyle
might come to his aid

   we know no police the man asserted

  a sarcastic rejoinder was on mattesons
lips but something convincing in the mans
tone arrested him

   why not he asked  where are
we

  he remembered the train with the land-
scape rushing by it he did not know how
long he had been unconscious he did
not know how many injections of drug he
had had

  the mans voice deep with feeling in-
toned 

         he who died at azan sends
        this to comfort faithful friends

         faithful friends it lies i know

        pale and white and cold as snow

and ye say  abdullahs dead

weeping at my feet and head

         i can see your falling tears

i can hear your cries and prayers

yet i smile and whisper this

 i am not that thing you kiss

cease your tears and let it lie

         it was mine it is not i 

the voice stopped abruptly the light
died and matteson was in darkness again
he almost doubted that alice had been
suspended there before his eyes

that sense of unreality which had
clutched him grew then a terrible fear
seized him alice he recalled had not
moved a muscle

  is she dead he called out  is miss
 wendell dead

  she is not dead she dies

 can anything save her

 again the voice intoned

 i worship agni who is the priest of
the house the divine priest of the sacrifice
and the priest of oblations he gives
wealth

 youre after miss wendells money
arent you matteson asked seizing upon
that as something he could understand

  he gives wealth the voice repeated
  is it your idea to keep us here till miss
 wendell makes some sort of agreement to
 pay you matteson asked  is that the
 big idea if it is why dont you say so
 have you talked to her about it what
 does she say

 she is  saturated with conventional
sanity and stubborn with health the voice
replied

a picture of a strong young figure in
overalls came to matteson he saw the
face of the girl he loved bright with
health shining with the consciousness of
physical and mental well-being thought
of her helped ijim to sanity in this exotic
situation

  shes game too he muttered

 he resolved to  hang a bluff

you can go on with your show he
said  im not going to be frightened into
anything

 not you she

 oh said matteson youre going to
do things to me till she yields is that
your game


all-story weekly

   she comes back now from afar said
the voice

  matteson felt that unearthly rush of
wind across his body again there was a
crash like thunder then there was com-
plete silence

  out of this silence came a small voice-
alices

   henry

   yes dear

   are you injured

   not a bit of it im all right are
you

   i have been asleep a long time alice
said weakly  where are we

  i	give it up matteson said  they
drugged us alice i was on a train a while
ago i dont know where weve been
brought to but you just stand pat
dont yield to that fellow ill get my
hands on him after a while then well
see

   youre bound arent you henry

   yes but dont give up what has he
asked you to do

  i he wants my fortune-all of it

   sure said matteson  its a hold-
up but it wont go through there is still
the law

   he is mad henry alice said and her
voice seemed to recede  he will torture
you i-

  	you what dear

   he wont let me talk any more the
girl concluded wearily

  there was complete silence again mat-
teson called alices name but she did not
answer in his disappointment and his
alarm at what might be happening to her
he screamed at the man a  hey you
followed by an oath before he realized
that it might reach alices ears

   will you yield the voice asked sud-
denly

   no matteson shouted  you can
go to the devil dont yield either alice
he was in the clutch of red anger now
he struggled violently to free his legs of
the thongs which bound them but he could
not his hands groped down to his feet
seeking a knot but they only found that a
leather thong ran away from his feet be-
yond his reach

   staked out in the grass i guess he
told himself

  as he straightened up his eyes were ar-
rested by another speck of light it was
of a greenish hue now and it grew with ex-
treme slowness matteson thought he
must have sat there for half an hour be-
fore it became as large as an egg

  it began then to radiate a greenish light
tiny wavering tongues licked out from it
and receded into it still it grew pres-
ently it was as big as mattesons hand an
oblong of sickening green

  matteson gazed at the light in complete
fascination he had not known that such
a glow could be generated suddenly the
light stopped growing it paled and then
in the center appeared the head of a snake

  it was a dull mottled head at first and
it hung there in the center ofthe light per-
fectly motionless the eyes were closed

  then as matteson watched the head
moved slowly from side to side the
mouth was opened the inside of it was
blood-red a red tongue darted out
there was a single hiss and then the air
was full of a rushing hissing sound

  matteson felt cold sweat break out on
his body like most normal men he
loathed and feared snakes of all kinds to
be lying here helpless with that moving
head red-fanged and venomous within a
few feet of him was enough to shake any
mans nerve

  he thought of alices father doubt-
less he had been through some such ordeal
as this but he had been in india mat-
teson was in america

  and yet was he in america how long
had he slept there had been that rail-
way journey he had heard of suspended
animation too could he have been trans-
ported over the sea without his knowing
it was he beyond the help of jack doyle

  while these thoughts and questions had
flashed through his brain he had kept his
eyes on the snakes head now he saw the
light waver and then it ran swiftly along
the snakes body the body writhed
there was a full twenty feet of it

  god keep me sane matteson
groaned

  the body of the snake slowly undulated
the great burmese



it began to move toward matteson its
mouth was open it hissed and again
the room was filled with that hissing sound

   and now said the voice

  the tone was as implacable as death it-
self matteson understood from it that
this was the crisis which the man sought
matteson must yield or suffer himself to be
embraced by the coils of the snake

  he tried to speak but no words came
he never knew afterward just what it was
that he had been going to say

  there was a crash back of him he
heard some object fall to the ground or
the floor or whatever it was that he sat
upon three flash-lights shot their rays
across the room they illumined matte-
sons captor he stood just beyond the
snake the lovely woman whose face mat-
teson had seen beside him

  there was a gleam of metal in the mans
hand but back of matteson there were
two pistol shots one after the other mat-
teson saw the mans hand drop his other
had clutched at his breast

  then there was the snap of an electric
switch the place was flooded with light
the lovely woman stood with her hand on
the switch she was staring at the man

  he had been swaying now he sudden-
ly pitched forward on his face and lay still

   a little rough work said jack doyles
voice behind matteson  i said a little
rough work would do it and i guess it
has ive been within fifty feet of you
ever since you and this crook left your
apartment some good shadowing if i
do say it

   you have killed the great burmese
the woman at the switch stated

   i dont doubt it said doyle  but
 guess he had it coming to him my dear
just who is the great burmese

chapter vii

who he was

rthe great burmese- the woman
     began

          just a moment please mat-
teson interrupted  rip these thongs off
me jack will you

  doyle cut the thongs and matteson
stood up for a moment he could not
move then when he could darts of pain
shot through his legs as restoration of cir-
culation began

  he walked slowly and painfully over to
the woman

   where is miss wendell he de-
manded

  before the woman could reply alice ap-
peared at the other side of the room mat-
teson ran to her despite his stiffness and
swept her into his arms before them all
he kissed her

   what you must have suffered he
said

  alice freed herself and held up her head
she was a little pale still beneath her tan
but that proud lift of her head belied
weakness

   thoroughbred doyle murmured

   no alice laughed to matteson so
low that the others could not hear  just
health from the lil op garden

  matteson gazed into her eyes for a long
fond minute then he turned about and
surveyed his surroundings curiously

  he saw that he was amid stage settings
what he had lain upon and had thought
was dry grass was a large mat the ave-
nues of trees were mere drops

   the ride on the train he questioned
the woman  that utter darkness

   a window before you and a revolving
mechanism beyond the window she an-
swered  the other black velvet curtains
dropping down from those rollers

  matteson looked up and saw the rollers
with the heavy curtains wound around
them

   they moved on oiled springs the wo-
man said

   that unearthly light and that whis-
tling wind and the hissing

   stage effects all

   well who was the great burmese
doyle asked

   dont you ever go to the theater
didnt you ever see the great burmese on
the big time he was the best of them all
till a couple of years ago when the dope
got him

   oh that gink said doyle  yeh


all - story weekly

ive seen him he was a wiz what hap-
pened him

   he was a burmese the woman said
 he came to this country years ago and
was educated in one of the big colleges
here he had a lot of stuff-magic stuff-
at his fingers ends he was a hypnotist
a ventriloquist and a sleight-of-hand man

   you saw how he held that girl sus-
pended in the air matteson that used
to be one of his tricks on the stage other
people did it too but nobody ever did it
the way he did of course it was a trick
but he always put it over big

   did he know miss wendells father
matteson asked

  the woman uttered a low chuckle

   of course he knew wendell she an-
swered  the great burmese went to
india every year or so to get stuff for his
acts wendel had gone over there with
his pretty daughter to see what there was
in the indian dope the great burmese
got him in tow it wasnt hard wendell
was looking for something and the great
burmese set out to make sure he got it in
good measure

   but the great burmese had left the
stage then according to your statement
matteson said

   sure he had left the stage then he
had been using dope for years queer
stuff too not often used belladonna
well on his way to india he stopped in
london and got an engagement he had
to have it his money was most gone
besides the dope he had another weakness
he played the american stock market he
had a system all his own  dont know
just what it was but it kept him poor

   well i was with him you might as
well know and we got so low in funds that
he was without his medicine for nearly two
days then when he got some he went to
it hard just before he was to go on with
his act he took a big dose an overdose i
guess anyway in the middle of his act
he got a kind of a stroke of paralysis
they had to carry him off the stage for
a good many hours he was delirious and
then he went into a stupor and almost
smothered to death

   i thought that when he come to he

would be broken-hearted because that
story would travel all through the theatri-
cal world-and did but he had nerve
the great burmese he had a few blank
minutes then he sat up in bed and said

    well thats the end of the great bur-
mese so far as the world will know im
done with trickery on the stage but we
have to have the money we will get the
money

   id been on the stage myself after
four years of hard work i made the big
time i met the great burmese in pitts-
burgh he thought pretty well of me from
the start my engagement ended in pitts-
burgh and the great burmese married me

   when we found ourselves broke in
london town i went singing in the music
halls we saved every cent we could and
then we went to india there the great
burmese met this wendell wendell was
looking for something and the great- bur-
mese had that something right in his mitt
excuse me he nearly had it i mean

   in four days he had wendell so con-
fused that wendell didnt know whether
he was coming or going he put wendell
through this stuff he was beginning to put
matteson through to-night then he gave
him a piece of glass and told him it was a
sacred sapphire

   oh yes i forgot he didnt let wen-
dell know of course that he was playing
a game at the proper moment when
snakes were all around wendell and bats
were flying and the wind was whistling
and the air was full of that awful hissing
he rescued wendell then he gave him
the sapphire

   he told wendell never to part with
the sapphire that was pure bunk the
girl threw it into the sea when she per-
suaded her father to lake ship for home
the old man couldnt stand the gaff and
died

   the great burmese thought he could
put it over on the daughter and he left a
stone for her by way of preliminary it
got her nerve too at the start she told
us last night that she fainted

  but when we got her here she was
just plain stubborn she wouldnt agree
to give the great burmese her money so
the great burmese



after he had left a stone for you matte-
son he had you brought here and started
to put you through his third degree he
thought he could break your nerve as he
had broken wendells he expected then
that the girl would yield and i guess she
would have if these gentlemen hadnt
broken down the door when they did

  the woman sighed deeply

   wed have been on easy street she
said

   why didnt the great burmese as you
call him get wendells money from him
doyle asked

   he had the promise of it as soon as
wendell got to the u s a she answered
 we followed him and his daughter right
over but the old man died dont you
know that made the great burmese
start all over again with the girl

   but wendell surely didnt believe that
he had to give up his money to the great
burmese did he matteson asked

   believe the woman said with a touch
of real scorn in her voice  why he
didnt believe anything he didnt have
to believe anything he was just plain
rattled the great burmese had him tied
up in a knot wendells brain was right
on the edge of the precipice when the
great burmese got through with him one
little push would have sent it over

   you ought to know the nervous condi-
tion he was in matteson you had got
only a sample of the stuff that wendell got
and you were beginning to sweat blood
yourself werent you

   i wasnt very comfortable matteson
admitted

   you werent born in india were you
doyle asked  you aint no burmese
yourself

   i was born in the east the woman
said then she laughed a low mocking
laugh  the east side of new york
she added

   the great burmese was crazy wasnt
he doyle asked

   he said he wasnt she answered
 he said he was sane hed say that
oftenest when he was fullest of belladonna
along toward the last he said everybody
else was crazy though

   plain nuts said doyle  a good
sleight-of-hand man but a bum black-
mailer a little old policemans gun will
spoil any trick like that ever invented-in
this here burmese place or in this village

   are you going matteson you might
as well the rest of this will be disagree-
able i guess you can borrow the car the
great burmese had hes got a white
chariot of his own now well slong g-
by miss wendell i dont claim your ac-
quaintance im just a policeman but
im glad i laid eyes on you it does a
man good to see the likes of you when he
goes up against the tricks of folks like the
great burmese get out of my way you 

  he kicked the mechanical snake aside
and walked over to the fallen magician

  matteson and alice went into the street
and got into the machine which had borne
matteson to the house matteson started
it they did not speak for a long time
alice leaned against mattesons shoulder
and rested

  at last matteson looked down at her

   why did you leave home without let-
ting me know alice he asked  why
did you leave at all and how did you
go

   the great burmese told me i was not
to marry you she said  he explained
to-night that that was the first lesson in
obedience for me he wanted to know if
i had broken my engagement to you

   he had his nerve matteson said
 you couldnt break that engagement
with a sledge-hammer

   when i went into the house he phoned
me to meet him she went on  we are
only two miles from my house you know
he said he would get you in his power and
kill you unless i obeyed i believed he
would do it i took a coat and a veil and
let myself out the front door without being
seen by the servants

   i was hiding in the shadow of the trees
when you came back i had seen the light
of your returning car i didnt know it
was your car of course but i hid just the
same

   the great burmese met me up the
road and brought me to that house we
have just left i was stubborn as he said


all-story weekly

he made me weary but when he brought
you to the house and began to try to scare
you i didnt know what to do doyle
came just in time

they fell silent again presently they
neared alices house

the

     my that looks good to me alice said
     would there be room for two in that
    lil of garden of yours alice

    right away she asked

    right away

   you b-e-t

end

belden

theres nothing the matter with the
english language except the words
in it if you say em separately they
dont mean anything and if you say em in
bunches they generally mean something
that aint so  they never come back
for instance you hear that and you be-
lieve it until all of a sudden you begin to
see it the other way i guess the truth is
that most generally they dont never come
back but sometimes they do

  you cant tell that to macklin though
him and me are likely to agree once in a
while in spite of bein pals for twenty-five
years but whenever we take a vote on this
comeback question the result is unani-
mous he says they never do come back
and to prove it hes got two arguments no-
body cant answer the one he uses when
the fly-by-xights are winnin is that if a
fellow comes back its a sign hes never
been away and when were losin he gets
real clever and allows that he hates to hear
any person talk like a damn fool

  what started us quarrelin about it was
somethin that happened in -

  we had a regular team that year our
battin order would remind you of march
 and our infielders could most generally
stay in the game even if they did fall over
a piece of chewing gum

  macklin had four of our suits sittin
around disgraced by what was in em from
april to the end of august mack had
picked em out of the crowd of youngsters
we took to texas for reasons which he con-
fided to me voluntarily after i asked him
fie says  well i suppose there must be
some reason why that bunch of bushers we
started with should live and call themselves
a ball-player but if so it has been hid
from me in the case of all except these four
perry he says  lays out to be a right-
handed pitcher and you can see for your-
self hes got a right arm even if he aint
got any speed or control or judgment or
experience nelson and bigbee he says
 assures me there aint no mistake about
their being outfielders and says theyll
make tycobb look sick showin that they
are cultured and read the classics which is
the kind of fellows you want to uplift your
a double double-play



team and that there little radford that
aims to be an infielder he says  of
course he looks like little eva and aint got
any pep and dont never field a ball he
aint been introduced to and thinks a bat is
a ornament but hes got brains says
macklin  yes you can see hes got brains
because he dont never say nothin

  so that there male quartet stayed with
us right through the season drinkin up the
water and drawin their pay up to the
th of august there wasnt a one of them
had ever took part in a regular game

  we sure had some team though leavin
out them drawbacks on the bench and we
had figured to walk away with the flag so
it jolted us considerable to have the whirl-
winds grab the lead late in june and hold
it right through july and on up to the
middle of august most of the time they
werent more than a half a game ahead of
us but when theyd lose wed lose and
when wed win theyd win and every time
wed play each other wed take turns win-
nin and finish up where we began

  it was on the th of august that they
come to town on their last eastern trip with
their little old half-game lead tucked away
in their bat-bag and every man on the
team ready to go the limit to keep it there
wed got it through our head by this time
that there was something besides days be-
tween us and the worlds series and when
we went on the field for the first game we
knew wed got to either win it some way
or else win it some other way

  there was a big crowd in the stands and
they went crazy over the stunts our infield
pulled in practise but macklin didnt
after hed batted em out a few he let
mason take his place and come over to
where i was hittin to the outfield

   keegan dont look very good he says

  keegan was the guy that played short

  i looked just in time to see him scoop a
grounder with one hand and curve it across
to first the stands went wild-they al-
ways fall for that one-handed stuff and
they didnt notice the throw was three feet
short

   he never was no star i says

   if i had a short-stop to match up with
the rest of the team says mack  id

never lose a game id have an infield
he says  like we had twenty years ago
when you and me and tex harvey batted
 and won all them pennants for the
bluebirds

  i hate anybody to start talking about
jhe old richmond bluebirds-even mack
it always takes me back to that year when
our great team was broke up and makes
me feel the way i did after it was all over
and i hadnt anything left to do but sit
around and remember that the standing of
the clubs wouldnt show the name of rich-
mond any more that the two best pals i
ever had was gone-macklin to new york
and tex harvey dead of pneumonia-and
that i didnt have no job

   i like the fly-by-nights theyre a great
little bunch of ball-tossers but therell
never be another team like the bluebirds
and mack knows it as well as i do in
them days him and me could field a bunt
without failin over our stomach and along
with harvey and blair we made an in-
field you couldnt have broke through with
a machine-gun

  most folks have forgotten old tex har-
vey but he was the best short-stop ever
lived and a regular guy besides he was
a black-haired brown-eyed fellow big and
tall and he would kill a sure two-bagger
with one hand as if it wasnt any trouble at
all the same time he was tellin the pitcher
how great he was goin and the umpire
what a piece of cheese he was and the
batter how you cant hit em when you
cant see em he wasnt afraid of nothin
on the field or off but when he got outside
of his suit he was pretty quiet and retirin
like you wouldnt expect he used to think
a lot and read books and tell mack and me
about what he read until wed josh the life
out of him

  i know one day he sprung this here re-
incarnation stuff on us he says when you
die you aint through with this world you
come back and have a lot more lives he
believed it too-used to plan what hed do
in his next life silly wasnt it most as
silly maybe as plannin what youll do in
this life we guyed him a lot about the
idea but he was strong for it

    you wait he says to us about a hun-


all-story weekly

dred times  until after im dead some
day youll need me and then ill come back
and show you

  i think the reason he rooted so hard for
this here reincarnation was on account of
ivy waverley he figured i guess that
him and her hadnt had a fair chance and
that the only way theyd ever get one was
by startin all over again of course it
wasnt their fault they never met each other
until after they was both married and if
they had been a lot of people it wouldnt
have stopped em for more than a minute
at the outside but like all good sports
they was so narrow-minded that all they
could see was to play the game out and
thats what they done

  one day in the summer harvey told me
they met and figured out just where they
stood and after that nobody ever seen em
together again once in a long while shed
come out to a game and sit in a field-box
down back of third and shed seem to be
lookip at every fellow on the team except
old tex andhim out there spittin on his
hands and hittin home-runs over the fence
-hittin em just for her you know like
another fellow d wave his cap to his girl
if he seen her in the stand-but never once
lookin her way

  and once in the winter tex and i went
to new york to see the skyrocket
when she was starrin in it and it ran three
hundred nights on broadway we sat in a
stage-box but if tex ever give one look at
her or her at him they done it while i was
winkin but did she play to him oh
boy i

  i dont know whatever became of ivy
waverley after harvey died richmond
was her home and she was there at the
time but she didnt come to his funeral
and i seen in the paper where shed had a
baby only the day before i kind of forgot
her i guess for i was feelin bad about
tex bein dead and then about the team
bein broke up all of a sudden and finally
about findin out that the clubs there was
left in the league was able to get along
without me on their payroll and now
whenever anybody says anything about the
old bluebirds them same feelins come back
and make me grouchy

  so when mack says if he had a short-
stop hed have a teamas good as the blue-
birds i says to him  yes i says  and
if you had a team like that theyd prob-
ably be lookin for a manager to match up
with them and if they found him i says
 where would you go to

  there was plenty of ways he could of
come back at me but he didnt so we laid
off the repartee and started out to win that
game

  ive seen some rotten ball-playin but i
never in my life lamped anything as bad as
what keegan pulled that day he only
stopped one grounder all afternoon and
that was the one he heaved ten feet over
jacksons head into the grand stand and
when he was up to the bat he missed the
signs half the time and the rest of the
time he missed the ball

   for the love of mike i says to mack
 take that guy out of the game before he
loses his last chance to die a natural death
 sure says- mack  and then whvll
i send in johnson on crutches or that
little radford youre so crazy over or
maybe youre figurin to play short your-
self you sure would cover a lot of ground
he says  if you would lay down on it

  i didnt say nothin back you couldnt
blame old mack for bein sore and besides
he owed me onefor what id said before
the game so i set around andprayed for
a lucky break

  it come all right only when i first seen
it i didnt exactly call it lucky it was in
the seventh with us one run behind and
keegan on second-where hed got to by
strikin out on a wild pitch-and two out
darragh lines a single to center long-enough
to have scored a elephant if he had of
started at the crack of the bat but this
here poor dub of a keegan forgets how
manys out or something for he holds his
base till he sees where the balls goin even
then he has a chance to make it but fraser
cuts loose with a great throw and riley tags
keeg out just as he slides into the plate

  and as if that wasnt bad enough keeg
gives a sort of a smothered choke and rolls
over and when they straighten him out
there they find my lucky break in the poor
boobs left leg just above the ankle
a double double-play



  it hurt him pretty bad i guess for in a
minute he started to groan and when they
carried him off he hollered so everybody
could hear him but he didnt get much
sympathy from mack or me we was both
tryin to think what wed do for a short-
stop then i turned back to the bench and
seen this here little radford throwin a few
to anderson

   i forgot you was alive i says to him
 you act like you thought you was goin to
play short

  he give me a queer kind of a look and
so help me he was the color of a new ball

  our team started to take the field and
mack nodded to him  go ahead says
mack cheerful as a ball-park in a snow-
storm  theres a rule says weve got to
put nine men in the field so i cant help it
dont get in the way

  ill bet the boys in the center-field bleach-
ers could see that kid shake when he walked
across the diamond as long as ive lived
in this world ive never seen anybody so
scared i had a vision of a parade of gray
suits crossin the home-plate and a box-
score showin  errors-radford 

  jimmy wendell was the first man up and
he started kiddin like he always does

   hey you little busher he yells to
radford first thing  you better get out of
the way you cant hold the one im goin
to hit

  the kid didnt even spit in his glove he
stood there all out of position like a man
only half awake

  wendell looked at two low ones and then
one come to him high and on the outside
and he landed on it he sent it sizzlin
down to short and i give him a base hit the
second it left his bat a good short-stop
might have got it but this here poor little
simp-well he scoops her up and shoots her
over to first while im still watchin for her
out in center

   hey you big busher he yells to wen-
dell  you better go sit on the bench
who told you you could hit and
 come on paddy he yells to old bates
who he was afraid to say  hello to in
the clubhouse  put em over and show
up this bunch they cant get nothin past
this infield

  i set there like a fool and stared at him
i swear hed grown a foot his face had
changed so you wouldnt know him all
the lines in it had straightened out as if
theyd found out all of a sudden where
they was goin his color had turned from
quittin-white to fightin-red

  twasnt so much the change in his looks
that got me goin though-ive seen men
before who looked different once they was
under fire-but the easy way he dug up
that grounder and the lightnin snap of his
throw and the aggravatin nerve of him
prancin around on one foot and guyin old
wendell and every expression of his face
and every motion of his body-each one of
em sent me further up in the air until
finally i flew clear back over twenty years
and come down and found i was in rich-
mond-back in old richmond with tex
harvey playin short in front of me just as
sure as he ever played it in his life some-
where in my head i could hear his voice
 wait till im dead some day youll need
me and then ill come back and-

  just then wilson fans for the third out
and the kid come walkin into the bench
with the crowd that always loves to see a
youngster make good givin him a cheer
that made the flagpole shake sures youre
bom i was gettin up to go out and meet
him and give him the glad hand when all
of a sudden it come over me does he
know hes harvey or dont he and i
looked and seen him laughin and wavin his
cap to the crowd just a happy kid and i
knew he didnt know

  in a minute old mack was by me
whats come to him he says- he
looks like a different man

  i seen mack hadnt recognized him
that wasnt as queer as youd think
though mack is a different kind of a guy
from me hes always thinkin about what
hes doin now insteadof what he used to
do once or what hes goin to do some time

i	guess hes right if i had of done that
way maybe id be a manager too instead
of a second assistant nobody if a guys
dead mack aint interested in him - his
business is with live ones-and i dont be-
lieve he thought of old tex more n once
in a year so i played up to him


all-story weekly

   i kind of think he looks like somebody
ive seen before i says

   sure he does says mack just begin-
nin to get it  he looks like-like-say
buck he looks like old tex harvey 

   you said it i lets out and then i
starts in with the dont-you-remembers
believe me i had some speed for i got
the whole situation mapped out for him
while we was walkin out to the cdlthin
lines he listened hard and i thought i
had him as excited as i wasbut when i
got done he spit and says  ah your
granmother are you supposed to be
coachin on first or tellin fairy stories
so i had to beat it over to first

  willis was up first hittin for bates
whose battin average aint much more n
a rumor he singled to left then kelly
and sullivan popped out but darragh
walked and mccullagh singled to the in-
field

  of course the crowd was crazy standin
up and wavin their arms and yellin for a
homer like they always do when a single
is all you need and when they seen young
radford cornin up with a bat pretty near
as big as he was they went crazier than
ever and hollered you can do it kid
as if he had of been ty cobb

  the way he swung his stick and the way
he stood up to the plate showed he was
votin with the majority and believed he
could do it ill bet the players and may-
be some of them rummies in the press-box
was the only people in sight who had a
suspicion that maybe he couldnt

  he was too green or something to look
around for orders and the funny thing was
mack never offered to give him none from
that i figured mack hadnt really no more
doubts than i had about who it was that
had crowded himself into the line-up no-
body ever would of dreamed of tellin tex
harvey how to hit

   theres only one thing left for him to
do i thought to myself and i hadnt any
more than thought it when he done it ho
landed on the first ball and cracked it on a
line over first it hit the fence a foot from
the top and caromed off down toward the
gate wendell was lucky to get it back in
time to hold him on third

  he might as well have let him go home
though that wallop put us two runs to
the good and give us back our confidence
and in their half of the ninth they went out
one-two-three

  i was crazy to get mack alone but he
sneaked off some place and it wasnt until
next morning that we got together i come
out to the ball park early and he was in
the clubhouse

   well he says to me first thing  hows

	grimms fairy tales or is it the  arabian
nights  seen any more ghosts since yes-
terday

   what i seen yesterday i was strong for
and im just as strong for it to-day - i
come back at him tex harvey i says
 told us if we needed him after he was
dead hed come back he always done
what he said hed do and-he has come
back thats all

  mack looked at me a minute and then
he says  lewis you sure are an easy
mark  aint denyin this kid did look like
harvey once he got out there and got
started it give me an awful jolt ill ad-
mit and for a while i was dopey enough
to fall for the same fool stuff youre failin
for but jack coleman that developed this
boy is over at the colonial and i seen him
last night and what he told me cleared the
whole thing up

   seems this radfords mother was an
actress coleman knew her-thats how he
come to take the kid he says she was a
dandy once the show got started but at
rehearsals she was a dub-couldnt do a
thing and acted scared to death into the
bargain her managers would nearly go
crazy thinkin shed be a frost and then on
the openin night shed jump in and put it
all over everybody in sight just about
what the kid done yesterday if you notice

   well her name on the stage was ivy
waverley ever hear it before she was
married to a man named radford and
this youngster was born in richmond the
clay before harveys funeral

  he stopped and looked at me like hed
handed me a knock-out i set there a little
bit and then it begun to come over me
what he was drivin at and then i started
gettin mad

author of  rajah of hell island  malay gold  nnala omalley etc

preceding chapters briefly retold

 it was in singapore that dave perkins american and broke met buck another american in a
 restaurant where sultan lumpur of kuala gajah attended by candelario a half-caste was
 also lunching buck oilered dave a position as interpreter on an archeological expedition that
 he was joining in spite of the fact that dave could speak no language other than english on
 their way to the ship they met captain fong tsai a chinese friend of bucks and skipper of the
 ship that was to carry the party the maria buck named after bucks wife who had returned to
 the united states

      the scientific status of the members of the expedition was questionable at least it was made
 up of traddle a stout trader who was paying the bills kelpy an irish-australian macfarlane a
 scotchman captain marshall an english remittance-man and findlay an american they had
 secured a permit from the sultan to make excavations on his royal preserves on hell island in the
 godung river and it was at the sultans request that professor graves and his niece leora were
 allowed to join the party

      when they reached the river candelario tried to poison professor graves and when his guilt
 was discovered jumped overboard and disappeared they hired some natives to clear the under-
 bush dave fell into the room of a house of a buried city and while there heard traddle kill
 macfarlane who before he died accused the half-caste of being in league with the sultan in a
 plot to rob the adventurers of the treasure they were seeking

     they were to look for four statues of buddha and after they found these traddle came back
 to the ship and told the others that he had found findlay dead by this time kelpy and marshall
 were becoming suspicious of the stout trader

chapter vi

sultan lumpur

that same night kelpy came out
flat-footed with the truth whether
the death of findlay had anything
to do with it i dont know but kelpy
asked us all except fong tsai of course
down to the cabin and there laid bare
everything

we sat around the big mahogany table

 buck and i and the graveses and mar-
 shall fat traddle was there not looking
 very humorous and marshall sat and
 pawed his mustache and watched miss
 graves kelpy did most of the talking

  we must be askin your pardon pro-
 fessor graves said he with his most en-

this story began in the all-story weekly for june 



 gaging smile  you see were not arche-
 ologists in the strict sense of the term

    i thought as much said graves dryly
 kelpy gave him a cheerful grin

    we thought ye did maybe well
 some time ago our late friend findlay may
 he rest in peace heard about a treasure
 that had been found here on hell island
 lie got us together to come and pick it up
 findlay had got the tale from a sick native
 and he was a little vague in places but not
 on the important points ill now relate it
 to you

   treasure i glanced at buck feeling
 pretty excited but i felt a lot more ex-
 cited when kelpy told us what the native
 had told findlay

   it seemed that the native had got lost in
j 	four quarts of rubies	

i

the ruined city he had found four statues
of buddha and one of those statues had a
swastika carved on the base-the others did
not the one with the swastika had a
hollow base with a room inside it was
gained by a loose stone in the back and
the native had found a tremendous lot of
jewels there he had carried off a few
leaving the rest and before he died he gave
one to findlay

  findlay had given it to traddle as his
share of the expenses and as proof of his
story it was a ruby and traddle had
sold it for five hundred pounds which is
five times as much in dollars

   that ladies and gentlemen is why
were here said kelpy  we had no in-
tention of imposin on you mr graves but
we were forced to cover up the mptives of
our expedition very carefully by this time
to-morrow night we hope to be at sea with
the loot aboard and so captain marshall
and i agreed that it was only right to lay
bare everything mr traddle agreed too

  he gave traddle a look and i judged
that traddle had agreed because he was
forced to kelpy and marshall were not
missionaries by a long shot but they were
not so bad as they might have been

   furthermore an besides went on
kelpy with a smile at miss graves  when
we find the jewels to-morrow we would be
charmed to present our queen of beauty
with her choice of the lot in token of our
high regard and esteem i might add that
we have decided to take care of mr buck
also who has served us faithfully and out
of his share he may do what he desires for
mr perkins-who is not strictly our em-
ployee

  that looked mighty white and miss
graves said so she made a beautiful
speech and wished them all kinds of luck
and said that maybe she would take the
smallest stone in the bunch just for a
souvenir then buck spoke up with his
wabbly grin

   dont perspicutate your chickens before
theyre hatched kelpy he said  how
dyou know that findlay told you the truth
about where the jewels are

  that staggered them all for a minute
they had not thought about that

   oh i say spoke up marshall  dont
be a blooming pessimist buck cheer-o
 bucks right i said  besides youre
forgotten something mighty important

   whats that said kelpy sharply

   did findlay have any map or chart
of the place i asked

   no said kelpy studying me  there
was none needed of course-

   all right that cinches it i said lean-
ing back  yes sir that cinches it
everybody was staring at me and kelpy
traddle and marshall were the most dis-
turbed men you ever saw

 here snapped kelpy quickly
 what are you drivin at anyway

   why the map i says calm and con-
fident  now gentlemen ive read con-
siderable about treasure hunts and buried
cities and so on ive made a stud of it
you might say and its always done the
same way yes sir everybody has to
have a map to begin with or a chart and
if there is none then it stands to reason
somethings wrong now if that malay
had only drawn a chart for findlay-
they all started to laugh and pretty soon
they roared

   all right i said getting up and going
to the door  if you think its a joke just
you wait i mean it

  that started them laughing again and i
went up on deck feeling angry

  i went over to the rail and filled my pipe
just as i was lighting it i heard a step be-
hind me and looked over my shoulder to see
traddle coming i dropped my hand to my
coat-pocket in a hurry but he stopped and
locked at me

   perkins he said  i believe you have
brains did findlay ever mention a map
to you

  of course he had not but i did not like
traddle so i thought i would worry him

   ive got nothing to say about it one way
or the other i returned watching him
pretty close  maybe i should not have
butted in that way not being a member of
this party but you found findlays body
-didnt you find the map

   no said traddle before he thought
 there was none on him-that is we didnt
see any when we looked him over


all-story weekly

  i was feeling rather angry at everything
in general and i turned on him

   look here traddle i said  thats
enough from you believe me ive got
your number and youd better be careful
you murdered poor macfarlane i know it
all right and if i can get his body dug up
ill prove it i judge that you murdered
findlay too and you were in cahoots with
candelario when he tried to poison us now
you keep away from me and from miss
graves too or ill make you pretty sick

  traddle was mightily astonished but he
was mad in a minute as he stood there
in the starlight i saw his big face get dark
with blood and his fat hands began to
shake then he gave a swift glance around
and saw that there was nobody in sight aft
and he took a quick step toward me

   quit it i said shoving my automatic
toward him he was so surprised that he
jumped about a foot then he shook his
head

   poor young man he said in a solemn
voice  still suffering from delusions

   youll suffer from something worse than
that if you come around me any more i
said

  he turned around and beat it i felt
mighty thankful that buck had given me
that gun because old traddle had been all
ready to jump me however i thought i
had better not say anything about it even
to buck so i kept quiet i could see that
buck was worried about miss graves
though i did not know why and i did not
want to add to his troubles just then

  that night kelpy had paid off the
malays and had sent them home because
he did not want them around when the
jewels were brought out so the next morn-
ing we were all up bright and early and
fong tsai put the boat with the engine out
for us and we all piled in even miss graves
and her uncle he and i were able to walk
all right by this time

  i judged that buck had maybe told fong
tsai about the jewels and that fong knew
kelpy did not trust him because as we
went toward the island fong tsai stood
on the schooners rail and wratched us with
a faint stony smile on his face

  we landed and started off through the

jungle by one of the tunnels which the
malays had cut in the trees and vines all
of us except miss graves had hatchets or
axes after we had struggled along quite
a spell kelpy who was ahead turned and
waved his hand

  heres the statue he said to miss
graves  if youll wait here with your
uncle well scatter around and locate the
others we must find the one with the
swastika

  well that statue was certainly a wonder
it was bigger than any statue i had ever
seen buck who paced off the shadow that
came down among the tree shadows said
it was forty-five feet high i judged he was
lying pretty free because a body could not
tell anything by the length of a shadowy
but the statue was a big one it was a
seated figure with no particular outline ex-
cept the head away up among the trees
and the head must have been ten or twelve
feet in diameter

  there was something majestic and grand
and solemn about that big stone figure
sitting there with its head up in the tree-
tops and its face had the most peaceful
look of repose you ever saw

   just think i said to miss graves
 hes been sitting there a thousand years
or so and has hardly seen a human being
in all that time i bet he has mighty little
respect for humans if he could only say so
she looked at me a sparkle in her blue
eyes

 thats a good thought she said quiet-
ly youre rather a surprising person
 why because i have good thoughts
she reddened a little  of course not
silly because-

  just then everybody called me all at
once-they had been calling me only i had
not heard them-and i had to get busy

  that statue faced south so we struck
straight north to find the opposite one all
of us except professor graves who wras
busy with the statue fell to work and
chopped out a passage through the jungle
here it was not such hard going as the rest
had been and we figured that there must
have been a plaza here in the old days for
there was nothing but plain stone paving
underfoot and no buildings
four quarts of rubies



  in half an hour we reached another
statue this one was lying on its back in
the jungle and marshall climbed up to its
base only to find that there was no swastika
on this one either

  so we went half-way between the two
statues and headed east we knew about
how far we had to go and sure enough in
another half-hour or less we sighted the
third statue ahead up among the trees like
the first had been kelpy was in the lead
when we got up to it and he slid in through
the trees around the base and let out a
wild yell

  here it is lads he yipped and we
came around to where he was we could
see right away that this statue was different
from the others because the base was all
carved up something scrumptious and right
in the center about as high as my head was
a big swastika which was very conspicuous

  at that we all rushed around to the back
and began hacking away the jungle there
i guess all of us were pretty well excited
but traddle was not so excited that he
overlooked a good bet because i was work-
ing at one corner of the statue all by myself
when suddenly something streaked out from
the trees and missed me by two inches and
was gone again in the jungle it was a
knife and it had meant business

  i jerked out my automatic and fired it
into the trees where the knife had come
from there was a wild yell and a minute
later traddle appeared in a hurry every-
body wanted to know what was up so did
he

   whats the matter with you he
roared at me

   nothing i said  you pretty near
hit me with that knife thats all

   it got jerked out of my hand he said

   that bullet got jerked out of my hand
 returned  and you look out or therell
be another-

   shut up snapped kelpy wiping off
the sweat from his brow  you two fools
keep quiet perkins put that cursed gun
away-first thing you know youll kill some-
body

   well i said  id be better suited that
way than having some one kill me

  he told me to shut up again but i saw

him look at marshall and knew that they
were getting old traddle sized up pretty
well by this time buck tipped me a wink
and seemed mighty relieved there was no
more said and we all got to work again

  professor graves and miss graves came
along having heard the shooting just as
we got the back side of the statue cleared
away then i can tell you there was
some excitement right in front of us and
about eight feet up we could see a big
stone set into the base of the statue-set
pretty loose too

  thats it yelped traddle here
kelpy let me get on your shoulders-

   not me said kelpy grinning
 youre the one to stand under-you and
marshall here perkins youre the
lightest one you get up and try to budge
that stone

  with us standing underneath said
traddle not yet

  however i got up and tried the stone
and found that it would move a little pro-
fessor graves chipped in and said to wedge
it over to one side which i did with a couple
of hatchets a minute later we could move
out the stone and there was a hole three
feet square in the statue and everybody
was trying to reach it before the others
kelpy got there first so then we stood back
and took turns getting up and crawling into
the hole traddle pretty near got stuck
going through but he got inside finally

  it was a pretty sad business taking it all
around inside the statues base was a
room about eight feet square kelpy
lighted it all up with an electric torch and
it was as empty as jonah was when he got
out of the whale there was not a solitary
thing in it not even a smell of a jewel
the ceiling was less than six feet high so
we had to stoop

  we did not stay very long any of us
we had found the right place and that was
all the good it did us professor graves
and leora were as disappointed as anybody
when they heard about it and kelpy stayed
inside longer than the rest so that he could
relieve his feelings without offending miss
graves traddle swore right out but mar-
shall turned on him and shut him up pretty
curtly


all-story weekly

  well we had brought a lunch-basket
along so we sat right down there and ate
our lunch and it was the unhappiest meal
id eaten for a long while but by the
time we got to our pipes we were able to
discuss the matter which we did

  no one else had been here for years the
condition of the jungle proved that so
either that native must have lied to findlay
-only he had described everything right-
or else findlay must have lied to his part-
ners

   findlay did not tell us everything
thats all said kelpy  mac thought as
much all along poor old mac he had
brains

   and findlay is dead put in marshall
giving traddle an ugly look  beastly
luck i say beastly blooming queer how-
old findlay came to trip on a vine eh
what

  maybe traddle judged that the talk was
getting too personal or maybe he really
thought i had the map anyway he
pointed at me and diverted the conversa-
tion

   ask him he said his fat face looking
pretty mean  what did he talk about a
map for last night unless he knew stole
the map from findlay the whelp did

  kelpy and marshall looked at me and
they were disappointed enough to be sus-
picious i saw right away that traddle was
out to make trouble for me so i hit him
first

  traddle i said you confessed last
night that you had searched findlays body
what did you do with the map

  that was stretching the truth a little but
it served to get everybody mixed up and i
heard buck chuckle to himself he was the
only amused one in the crowd a good
many things might have happened but miss
graves intervened

   theres no use staying here i think
she said coolly  its frightfully hot and
i dont believe its very healthy uncle
lets go back to the boat

  that gave me an opening and i said i
would go along kelpy and marshall and
traddle wanted to stay and investigate
more but buck came along with us and
we hit for the big stone dock and the boat

  buck said that this was the way treasure
hunts usually turned out except in books
which was a dig at me however i didnt
care what buck said because i was walk-
ing ahead with leora and we were talking
about nothing in particular but i felt
mighty proud to have her holding my arm
and to be protecting her against snakes and
animals i was just telling her about blue
being my favorite color for eyes when we
came out on the edge of the stone wharf
and then we stopped dead

  for out beside the maria buck there
was a second ship anchored-not so big
but gaudy and queer-shaped with flags all
over her and about twenty feet away
from us where a boat had just put him
ashore was a little man who looked like a
brown monkey except for his red fez and
his frock-coat and the diamond in his neck-
tie i knew him right away too-it was
sultan lumpur himself behind him as
always was lim perak the body-guard
looking as ferocious as usual

chapter vii

findlays chart

buck says that first impressions are apt
to be misleading in the right direction
which after you get it straightened
out is pretty good sense

  sfceing sultan lumpur from a distance
and hearing about him had not made me
like him but meeting him made me think
maybe i had been wrong i dont know
much about the general run of sultans but
lumpur in spite of his physical disad-
vantages must have averaged pretty high
when he laid himself out to be agreeable
he was as pleasant a man as youd meet
anywhere

  leora introduced me then buck and
graves came along and buck was intro-
duced and sultan lumper stretched him-
self trying to be friendly he had been
educated in england and he spoke english
just like marshalls there was nothing
stand-off about him either he was demo-
cratic and about like any ordinary mortal

  he was quite concerned to hear about
gravess illness and he took us to his boat
four quarts of rubies



and had us rowed out to his ship he
showed no interest whatever in kelpys
party and of course we did not say any-
thing about treasure or the things that had
happened the sultan had just come from
singapore and was going to stop at his
royal preserve for a while on the way to
kuala gajah

  we went aboard his barge as he called it
and then i began to see that the books had
told the truth after all there was a big
silk awning aft and lumpur got out cigars
and cigarettes and wine and lemonade and
cakes and had a royal party in spite of
his looks he was no slouch as a sultan
either all his personal possessions were
slathered with jewels and we had solid-
silver cups and gold-plated plates and his
cigar humidor was studded with rubies i
began to feel that i was moving in high
society at last

  after we had talked for a while and the
sultan had taken quite an interest in buck
and me we saw traddle and marshall and
kelpy come down to the schooners boat at
the island wharf and start out the sultan
said to bring them aboard so buck hailed
them and they came alongside it was
easy to see that they had discovered noth-
ing for they were hot and mad and tired

  they felt a little better after coming
aboard and getting a couple of drinks sul-
tan lumpur did not bother them about
archeology but was quite polite i could
see that marshall riled him up considerably
marshall was one of those englishmen who
think a native is a native and should stay
so and he was barely polite to the sultan
being stiff and haughty then the sultan
sent a boat to get fong tsai which i
thought was mighty handsome of him but
it made marshall mad again because he
took fong to be a common chink

  however miss graves gave marshall a
little talk on the side and straightened him
out and fong tsai came abroad and we
had a very pleasant afternoon then the
sultan said we made up a very cosmopolitan
crowd and he enjoyed it and he asked us
all to stay aboard and go up to his royal
preserve with him and make him a visit
he said there would be some shooting and
a general good time - and he was right

about that too only not the way he meant
it maybe

  well kelpy said he was a bit tired of
archeologizing and the others agreed that
they needed a rest i said i must get a
clean shirt or two which made the sultan
laugh and miss graves wanted some more
clothes so we decided we would get our
things and go along with the sultan fong
tsai did not say anything until the sultan
pressed him then he bowed and said he
would be charmed so we got into a boat
and went back to the maria buck

   was feeling pretty good over being a
sultans guest and hobnobbing with royalty
that way but i noticed that fong tsai and
buck kept quiet and looked anxious back
on the schooner i slung some things into a
suit-case and then i went into the stern
cabin to find buck he was there and so
was fong tsai and so were the two
chinese mates of the schooner fong was
talking to them

  not wanting to disturb him i went over
to the table and there was the same chart
of hell island and the lagoon which findlay
had used when he was talking with can-
delario that day i looked over the chart
and then suddenly i saw something down
in one corner it was a lot of squares and
the square in the center was heavy and
black like some one had been absent-
mindedly using a pencil while he talked
then  remembered that findlay had had
a pencil in his hand that day the truth
came to me in a flash

 buck i said excitedly come
here 

  buck ambled over and i showed him the
markings and told him about findlay

   listen here  i said  do you remem-
ber that room inside the statue it was
made of square flagstones all around wasnt
it well i bet you a dollar that this is the
missing chart findlay had it on hfs mind
and he scribbled it down here knowing that
no one would make anything of it those
squares stand for the square stones in the
floor and that black one in the center is the
one that comes up and the jewels are buried
underneath it

  buck looked at me and grinned

   son he said  your previsual percuity


all-story weekly

is pretty good-but dont bank on it if i
had your imagination i would be a charla-
tan of industry no use dave kelpy
sounded that chamber for hollow places
and there was none

   that dont prove anything i shot
back at him  the center stone-

   was laid in cement like all the rest
broke in buck  forget it dave

  i shut up but i did not forget it just
then fong tsai opened up a big chest that
he always kept locked and inside i saw all
kinds of revolvers and automatics and he
said something to the two chink mates
then he locked the chest and gave one of
them the key

   whats fong got on his mind i asked
buck

   nothing much said buck  only we
dont trust sultan lumpur very much hes
a slimy centralpede and hes got some game
afoot

   thats all talk i said  he told us
himself about introducing law to the coun-
try and how there was not a thief in all his
dominions and so forth remember well
i judge youve got excited from reading
dime novels buck this part of the coun-
try is just as tame as south dakota

   youve taken quite a shine to the sul-
tan havent you says buck sarcastically
 all right son wait and see 

  i was thinking more about that chart
than about the sultan however it looked
to me like i had struck the nail square on
the head but there was no use talking to
buck just then so i kept quiet there was
no use telling kelpy either i was not in
his employ and if i could locate those
jewels on the side that was his loss and my
gain so i said no more about it to any-
body but began to scheme how i could get
to the island and do some exploring on my
own hook i had no chance for a while
though

  the afternoon was about two-thirds gone
when we went back to the sultans barge
which had been laid alongside the schooner

  the sultan told his malay skipper to go
ahead and the barge put out long oars and
began to row us into the river while we
waved good-by to fongs chinese crew

  as we went in toward the river every-

body was settled around the sultan who
was talking about candelario and saying
that if he could locate the half-caste he
would certainly hang him for trying to
poison graves he was most emphatic
about it too

  buck touched my arm and indicated the
sultan and fong tsai who was big and
silent and inscrutable

   there are the best and worst of asia
dave said buck softly

   yes i said  and across the table
traddle and miss graves-the worst and
best of america

   right and buck laughed to himself
 you seem a lot interested in miss
graves 

  never you mind-youre married i
retorted and he shut up

  on the way up the river sultan lumpur
talked just like he was an ordinary person
and made himself agreeable fie did not
try to hide that he was a mohammedan or
that he had his own notions of enjoying
life he was quite frank about it and did
not put on any civilized airs either we
all liked him fine and if fong tsai or buck
did not they kept quiet

  we got up to the malay village and the
barge tied up at an ironwood wharf among
the trees a little farther on the sultan
had sent a boat on up the river that morn-
ing so at the wharf we found a whole re-
ception committee there were bullock
carts fitted up pretty grand and malay
soldiers with rifles and swords and gay silk
robes and a fat little man who was the
sultans steward  his name was tock
gump then there were drummers and
flute players and a crowd of ladies who did
not believe in hiding their light under a
bushel as buck said they danced and the
soldiers fired their guns and everybody was
happy because the sultan had come home
i judged they must think a heap of him

  so the band started to work and we got
into the carts and off we went it was a
gay and gaudy procession with the women
dancing on ahead and singing and the band
tootling and the jungle all around us but
all of a sudden the jungle opened up and
we came into the open at the top of a hill
to see the sultans palace down below
four quarts of rubies



  it was close to sunset and that palace
in the red sunset light was the most beau-
tiful place you ever saw it was just like
what i had read about only more so there
we were processioning along with a royal
escort when that palace burst upon us as
i have said the sultan had built it out of
an old temple and it had the same queer
architecture that the ruined city had full
of curlicues and fancy work

  off to one side was a regular little town
where the sultans lady friends and soldiers
lived the palace itself was the main thing
the whole front was gilded and some of
the roof and we could see the shimmer of
glass windows and a hothouse which made
it real up to date the building was of
stone and mighty beautiful

  out in front of the palace were pved
terraces two of them very wide and with
little pools of water running through them
and flowers growing in spots out beyond
these there was a lake perfectly round and
maybe three hundred feet across from
the edge of this lake on the side facing the
palace a narrow stone walk ran out almost
to the center-but not quite just beyond
the end of that walk and separated from
it by about two feet of water there was a
big bronze buddha with his base down
under the water so that he seemed to be
sitting right on the lily-pads that were
scattered around he reached about twen-
ty feet high

  buck was sitting next me he leaned
over

   its mighty pernexious that a moham-
medan sultan should have a statue of
buddha in his front yard he said to me

   its got the greenish sheen of bronze
i said  maybe its a relic that he found
there and did not disturb

  buck guessed that it was so and we
later found that i was dead right

  all around that lake there were gardens
and trees-it was a mighty well kept place
to judge by the looks over beyond the
lake was another building not so ornate as
the palace and this was where the regular
wives of the sultan lived our driver was
pleased when buck talked malay to him
and he explained everything seemed quite
proud of the place too he was just like

a hackman back in the states explaining
points of local interest to his fares he
would not say anything about the bronze
buddha in the lake however which seemed
odd

  when we got to the palace there were
slathers of servants all bowing to the sultan
and he welcomed us all with a flourish and
a speech but he welcomed miss graves
particularly that was only proper she
being the only female in our party he
gave her two pretty malay girls to wait on
her and we were all escorted to our rooms
by brown men buck and i stuck together
because we preferred not to be separated

  the inside of that palace certainly laid
over any work of fiction that i ever read
some of it wras occidental and some of it
was oriental and all of it had the arabian
nights faded completely there were gold
pianos and no end of rugs and such and
cut glass chandeliers and electric lights
and marble columns and more things than
i can begin to tell about when we got
up-stairs to our rooms we found them
fitted with brass beds and wash-stands and
everything as modern as you would find in
san francisco

   this beats the books all hollow  i
said to buck when we had sent away the
servants and had our bedroom to ourselves
 this sultan has electric lights and a
water-works and i never saw them men-
tioned in any fiction-book about the far
east

   yes says buck looking out the win-
dow at the lake  and there are crocodiles
in that lake dave

   what of that i asked him

   darned if  know but i conticulate
they arent family pets by a long shot

  getting washed up i slid into a clean
shirt and borrowed a fancy red necktie from
buck and went on down-stairs leaving him
to primp

  it was a gorgeous place right enough i
roamed around enjoying things right and
left electric lights were blazing in every
room by this time and i discovered all sorts
of queer places there was a picture gal-
lery which was maybe all right for a pic-
ture gallery but would have been pretty
shocking in a saloon thinks i this sultan


all-story weekly

is not afraid of the naked truth anyhow
then there was a music-room with all kinds
of wonderful instruments in cases and a
library and a gun-room filled with varieties
of guns and a court with a fountain playing
around colored lights i was not alone be-
cause plenty of servants hung around to
keep me from stealing anything i judge
after a while i came to a smoking-room
and traddle was there he looked just as
fat and dirty as ever

  i was not going to back out because he
wras there so i went up to the table and
took a cigarette from an open box and
lighted it

   well traddle i said thinking to
tease him  you guys did not find anything
in that statue eh

  he growled at me like a dog with a few
swear words sandwiched in

   mac said that the sultan was after the
loot too i went on giving him a dig
 but i guess mac was wrong about that
any sultan as rich as this one wouldnt
bother his head over a mess of jewels
would he

   youre too blanked smart said trad-
dle hoarsely  these native sultans are
the worst loot-chasers you ever seen young
un you neednt give me no more of your
innocent ways perkins im wise to you
and youd better come across with that map
before its too late youve got it and you
neednt lie about it

  i looked at him feeling good over getting
him worked up that way

   well i says  i wouldnt bother to
lie to you anyhow traddle youre too
mangy if you were as smart as you think
you are you woukl not have made so many
mistakes you murdered poor little mac
who  might have told us some informing
things about this sultan then you got busy
and murdered poor findlay who might
have told you where the loot was then you
tried to murder me-and if youd done it
you never would see the loot

   what his mouth opened and shut
like the mouth of a fish and he stared at
me  what then you admit it youve
got the map

   well i says calmly  ive got the
only map findlay left or at least i know

what it said-and nobody else knows no-
body else will ever see that map either if
you make any more mistakes you might
just as well leave that treasure lying in the
ruins because it will never be found so
youd better nurse me right along into good
health traddle if you ever hope to grow
rich off me

  i said this hoping it would take his mind
off killing me if i had known that any
one else was around i would never have
said it of course just as i got through i
saw traddles eyes leap from mine and go
over my shoulder at somebody else i
turned and there was sultan lumpur not
far behind me his feet making no noise on
the carpet he was all togged up in eve-
ning clothes and had a big jeweled decora-
tioon his shirt front

   well gentlemen he said with a snaky
grin  its ripping fine to have you make
yourselves at home-corking i call it id
like to show you my trophy-room if you
would care to see a few heads before din-
ner-

  we talked about trophies the rest of the
time but all the same i knew that the sul-
tan had heard what i had said and had
tucked it away in his mind

  during dinner buck told me that can-
delario was on the place and that the
sultan was keeping him hidden thinking we
would not know it you can judge whether
i enjoyed my dinner after that

chapter viii

guests of the sultan

the sultan did himself proud over the
dinner there must have been twen-
ty courses and several different kinds
of wine with each course and we ate off
real gold plates i know they were real be-
cause i nicked my plate with my fork to see

  after dinner we went out on the first big
terrace we had coffee there and more
drinks and just as the full moon came up
over the trees and the lake a couple of na-
tive women appeared on the second terrace
and danced for us with a hidden orchestra
it was queer dancing but pretty good at
that
four quarts of rubies



  by this time it was late so miss graves
and her uncle went to bed and the sultan
proposed a poker game fong tsai and
traddle and kelpy joined in so did buck
but it was beneath marshalls dignity to
play with a chink and a native so he stayed
oul i did not play either but stuck around
a little while then went to bed

  all this time i had no chance to talk
with buck he came to the room long
after midnight and unloaded a bunch of
money so i judged that he had played his
cards this time

   well i said  what about cande-
lario where did you see him

  buck did not answer but went to the
window there was a balcony running
along the house outside and fong tsai
had the next room to ours a minute later
buck turned out the lights and i heard
him say something at the window and
fong tsai came into the room that way

  we held a council of war sitting there
in the dark

  it seemed that while we were arriving
buck had caught a glimpse of candelarios
face at a window watching us there was
no mistake about it and there was no mis-
take about the half-caste being here with
the full knowledge and consent of sultan
lumpur either

   then candelario is working with the
sultan just as you said all along i stated
 but who are they working against

   thats what we cant perfigurate re-
turned buck

   yes we can came the cool steady
voice of fong tsai out of the darkness
 weve been terribly blind not to have seen
it from the first

  all right said buck -pelucidize
the aerosis fong

  fong tsai lighted a match and held it
to the little pipe he always carried in the
darkness the flame illumined his big strong
face with its cruelly curving nose and its
chiseled outlines and thinks i to myself
id sooner have old fong at my back than
any one else i know his face alone gave
me a comfortable feeling of security

   it is terribly simple said fong slowly
 as we suspected candelario is working
hand in glove with the sultan remember

lumpur is a wise old man and has plenty
of spies to serve him he doubtless knew
from the start that kelpy had a treasure-
hunt planned this dog of a candelario
was instrumental in what followed

   remember gentlemen the things that
happened at singapore before we sailed
through the wiles of candelario professor
graves came aboard us--with miss graves
why did not the sultan take them on his
own barge as his guests because he
dared not fie knew that the authorities
would give graves a warning

   but i broke in  you said back at
singapore that the sultan hated ameri-
cans

   exactly said fong tsai gravely
 for some time the sultan has set his
heart upon adding a white woman to his
harem-a white woman who is not an out-
cast of the treaty ports if he brought the
graveses up here himself he would be re-
sponsible for them if they came with our
party we would be responsible should they
disappear 

  that struck me all of a heap i could
not believe it at first

   i think you have the sultan figured
wrong i said desperately  why fong
it just cant be true the sultan is a good
old sport-

   my dear mr perkins said fong tsai
coolly  in this country anything can be
true two men of our party have already
been murdered you have seen how plausi-
bly these murders were covered up how
little stir their deaths occasioned if pro-
fessor graves died and miss graves dis-
appeared even if every man of us perished
the sultan could produce witnesses and lies
and evidence which would absolve him ut-
terly from any wrong-doing and remem-
ber the british would not dare search his
harem they would not dare investigate
this palace even without indisputable
proof and would they ever get such proof
no they might suspect but they have
suspected lumpur of many things and he
laughs at them

   lord exclaimed buck drawing in his
breath sharply  i suspected some of our
own gang had designs-but the sultan him-
self i guess i was blind


all-story weekly

  it made me feel cold up my spine to hear
buck talk that way as though he believed
fongs theory to be quite true i could
not help believing it myself now i knew
what buck had meant about  treasure dead
and alive

   we must face the facts said fong
tsai calmly  it was not until to-night
that i fully realized just what was going on
now let me set forth the situation and do
you correct me if i am wrong

  so he started in first with the treasure
part of it kelpy and marshall were at
present baffled by not finding the jewels
they more than suspected traddle now of
having killed mac and findlay and they
were up a stump traddle was baffled too
but he suspected me of knowing the secret
of the jewels

   and so i do captain fong i broke
in and told him about findlays tracings

  i-ong dismissed my theory just as buck
had done because kelpy had gone all over
the floor and walls of the room in the
statue there were no loose stones and
there were no hollow stones the room was
tight as a drum and that ended it

   to conclude so far as the treasure is
concerned went on fong having shut me
up  the sultan is as anxious as any one
to get the loot kelpy and his friends do
not know that candelario was an agent of
the sultan but because kelpy was nearly
poisoned they will shoot candelario on
sight so will i for that matter but mark
the reflex candelario is here under lum-
purs protection-and lumpur is capable
of killing us all

  there was another facer because we
could see that it was true

   miss graves is in no immediate dan-
ger pursued fong  but her uncle is cer-
tainly marked for death i shall warn him
to-morrow and i shall charge myself with
his safety i am not sure whether traddle
designs anything against miss graves he
is an unspeakably dirty rascal and would
stoop to anything however traddle does
not know that the sultan is interested either
in the jewels or in miss graves but
candelario has doubtless warned the sultan
against me-because i was particularly in-
vited here now let us consider it all

  the affair was more or less involved cer-
tainly although fong tsai had straight-
ened it out to some extent when i told
about meeting traddle before dinner and
the sultan overhearing what i had said
fong and buck were a heap interested
they agreed however that this put me out
of any danger because traddle and the
sultan would both think that i knew where
the jewels were and they would not kill me
until i had told this was not so com-
forting as it might have been they had a
cold-blooded way of talking about folks be-
ing killed which i did not relish very much

  we decided that there was nothing to do
for the present except to wait and see what
might happen buck believed that there
was a wireless somewhere on the premises
and we knew that the sultan had one on his
barge so that candelario could have kept
him informed that was all past and done
with now however

  whichever one of us saw graves first in
the morning was to tip him off and fong
was to arrange some action with him later
on so we let it go at that for the present
and adjourned our meeting we were not
sure of traddle or what he intended in
fact we were mighty wobbly about him and
wanted to find out what was on his mind if
we could it was bad enough in the sultan
wanting to force miss graves to marry
him-that was about the limit but traddle
was so low down he might do anything and
he was not even gentlemanly lke lumpur

  the next morning before breakfast there
was a blowout for fair and it showed things
up pretty well fong tsai as it happened
had gone out looking for graves and had
come to the first terrace above the lake
he found traddle there all alone buck
and i who were getting dressed saw the
whole thing from our windows and fong
later told us what passed

  fong tsai would have gone on but
traddle stopped him now like the rest
of his crowd traddle thought that fong
was just an ordinary chink from the
straits settlements and would be up to any
deviltry

  so seeing that there was nobod else
around traddle up and tells fong tsai
that he knows where the jewels are but he
four quarts of rubies



does not want them particularly all he
wants is miss graves he tells fong that
he needs the schooner to get away in and
offers to give fong tsai all the jewels if
fong will help him get off with miss graves

  fong looks at him steady for a minute
then asks what about his partners

   oh says traddle with a dirty grin
 i should worry about them let them
stay here if they like it when we get
away with the girl-

  just at that point fong tsai lit into him
i never saw a fight to beat it either trad-
dle had all kinds of sand and i judge he
had all his guns on him but fong never
bothered going after a gun he just stood
there and began to whale traddle with his
fists

  he landed about six times before traddle
woke up to what was going on and by that
time old traddle was reeling and cursing
like the bum he was fong doubled him up
with a solar plexus blow and traddle
jerked out his armpit gun just as he fired
fong hit him again and knocked him flat
so the bullet went up in the air

  fong took the gun from him and hit him
as he got up but traddle jumped away and
started to fight with his fists he was no
slouch either but he was up against a
human whirlwind fong tsai had a kick
in both fists and in about ten seconds
backed traddle down on the next terrace
and with a few more blows had traddle at
the edge of the lake traddle stood there
his fat face all red and purple and hollered
for help he put his hands down and quit
fighting altogether

  at that fong tsai turned away from
him in contempt but i saw traddles
hand slip into his pocket and i remembered
that queer little gun with four barrels so
i let out a yell through the window and
fong turned just as traddle fired then
traddle fired a second shot but fong tsai
did not seem to be touched he walked
right up to traddle and gave him one awful
blow that lifted fat old traddle off his feet
and sent him head first into the lake

  by that time of course there was a
crowd gathered including the sultan and
all the rest of us even buck had rushed
for the scene though i stayed at the win-

dow some of the sultans men grabbed
traddle out of the water just in time to get
him out of the way of a monstrous big
crocodile traddle lay there unconscious

  fong told everybody exactly what had
happened miss graves was not on the
spot so he kept back nothing the sultan
wanted to hang traddle immediately but
fong says  no send him down to my
schooner in irons and ill take care of him
the sultan said all right and gave the
orders his fat steward tock gump
called some of the soldiers they tied trad-
dle hand and foot and carted him off

  thinks  that finishes traddle and all
his fine schemes

  i hurried down to the terrace and found
everybody agreeing to tell miss graves that
traddle was sick and had gone to the
schooner which was to spare her feelings
she had seen the fight from her window
however so that scheme fell through and
the sultan cooked up another story which
she believed fong tsai had a bullet hole
in his left arm but it had not touched the
bone and had done no harm to mention
he was mighty thankful for that yell i had
given him and said he would repay me
some day he did too

  i think i have already said that the sul-
tan had taken quite a shine to me while
we were at breakfast the steward pre-
sented me with a big tray by the sultans
orders and on the tray was a complete out-
fit of native clothes and they were grand
i tell you all was of the finest silk the
vest and sash were embroidered the sarong
and trousers were bright red and yellow like
a spanish flag and all over the vest were
little dangling gold crescents that tinkled
when i walked then there was a gorgeous
sword with a blade like a flame-a kris it
was-and it was all inlaid with gold and
silver

  the sultan said he hoped i would honor
him by wearing the costume of course i
had to go to our room and change and
everybody made all kinds of fun of me
buck and fong came along and helped me
into it

   hunting party this morning said fong
tsai  lumpur is trying to make us all
forget the disagreeable incident i imagine


all-story weekly

   traddle is the one to want to forget
said buck grinning  i emisculate why
he sent dave this outfit though does it
look right to you fong

   it looks mighty grand to me i said
looking at myself in the mirror

   sure said buck  the suit is all
right-but why did the sultan give it to
you

   why to honor me of course ill
leave it to fong if that wasnt the reason

  fong tsai smiled his queer inscrutable
smile as though he was waiting for some-
thing to impress itself on us he motioned
toward my automatic which was lying on
the bed

   youd better not go around without
that implement mr perkins he said
quietly  and would you mind letting me
have a look at that kris it is a real
beauty

  i gave him the kris and then picked up
the automatic but there was no place to
stow it unless i stuck it in the sash that
way it was mighty unhandy and would
show to every one there was not even a
pants pocket i began to think that looking
like a gaudy humming bird might be fine
and grand but had its drawbacks then i
saw buck looking at fong tsai with a
glimmer of admiration

   fong says he  how did you guess
it

  i was puzzled of course then i saw
that if i wore this outfit like i had to i
could not possibly carry my automatic

   what  broke out  do you mean
that he gave me this sos i would not be
armed  

   exactly said fong tsai with a little
nod  and this kris-watch

  he took that beautiful kris in his hands
gave it a little snap-and it broke in two

   that is an old trick said fong tsai
 a dyak chief gives a man a kris like this
and then takes his head without any trouble
at all but  have something here that be-
longed to mr traddle it will blend ex-
cellently with your native dress and no one
will guess that you have it-

  he produced trad dies armpit holster
with a small but powerful automatic and
put it on around my left shoulder it fitted

snug and was quite out of sight he and
buck showed me how to use it however
i did not feel exactly happy about the whole
affair

   well i said  do you think he means
to have me knifed or something

  fong said no not at all according to
him the sultan was just taking precautions
because kelpy had told him what a dead
shot i was supposed to be and the sultan
took a neat and smooth way of preventing
me carrying a gun as he thought that
cheered me up some and we went back to
the crowd down-stairs

  there was a heap of fun made of me
naturally miss graves said if i was only
dyed brown she would expect to get kid-
naped or something so i said that if i was
brown she might certainly expect it that
made her blush considerably and tickled
the sultan

  we went hunting and had a grand time
whether he was at meals or anywhere the
sultan always had that bodyguard lim
perak standing behind him and on this oc-
casion lim was gun-bearer we went into
the woods a-piece and natives drove differ-
ent animals past us and we shot whatever
we had a mind to i said i did not care to
shoot having hurt my shoulder when i got
buried under the stones and dirt on the
island so i got out of showing my ability

  but miss graves was a wonder with the
rifle she and the sultan between them
did the best work captain marshall had
been drinking and was unsteady and he
was mad at the way the sultan laid over
him kelpy enjoyed himself a lot though
and so did all of us they shot deer and
two panthers and some birds and a jackal
and other things that i did not recognize
we had lunch out there in the woods and
came back when it got too hot for comfort

  on- the way back we passed the place
where the soldiers and servants and lady
friends of the sultan lived not the harem
which was a separate building but the little
town we stopped there a while so that
the sultan could execute justice on one of
the soldiers who had knifed another man
the sultan ordered him hanged and they
took him off then the party went on
home all except me and buck
four quarts of rubies



  buck stayed to flirt with a brown lady
who had made eyes at him and i stayed to
look after buck and that was one time old
buck certainly got us into trouble

chapter ix

leora hears something

buck spoke malay which he had
learned while he was managing a gold
concession he told me later just what
was said

  it seems that while everybody was watch-
ing the sultan execute justice which he did
with considerable pomp and enjoyment all
around buck sauntered around a corner
of the building and came pop on an open
window with a girl sitting in it

  she was one of the sultans particular
lady friends - not his regular wives of
which he had four but the other kind-
only buck did not know that so when she
spoke to him he did the same then i
drifted along and buck introduced me
the girl slipped me a cigarette from a pile
beside her on a brass stand and out of
politeness i smoked up while she and buck
conversed

  her name was kapit ai perang which
was malay for one reason why men leave
home she was golden brown with pink
under it and as pretty a girl as youd ever
want to see there was considerable jewelry
on her and not much else to speak of so
that i felt sort of embarrassed she did
not mind herself a bit however and started
in to make buck feel right at home i
judged that buck had made a big hit with
her for some queer reason

  then she asked buck if he had brought
the sultans new white bride and buck quit
his fooling right away and asked what she
meant kapit ai perang waved her ciga-
rette and laughed

   why she says  it is no secret that
the white bride arrived yesterday was
she not welcomed with music and dancing
and flowers

   oh said buck  i thought that was
for the sultan 

   for both of them said she an
apartment is being made ready even now

  well of course that confirmed all bucks
suspicions but that was not all of it when
the sultan took his new white bride his
present favorite would be fed to the croco-
diles in the lake and kapit ai perang was
the present favorite or the late one so
you can figure out for yourself just how
much she wanted to see the sultan marry
miss graves

  as a matter of fact the young lady was
pretty desperate with those crocodiles star-
ing her in the face every day buck he
sympathized a heap with her and he ex-
plained how matters were with us she was
right glad to hear that leora had no notion
of marrying the sultan and she was so
grateful to buck that she insisted on kissing
his hand

  she did it too and just as she did it
along comes that fat dyak tock gump
when she saw him kapit ai perang made
just one dive out of her seat and was gone
the steward had seen her kiss bucks hand
so naturally he concluded that buck and
she had been kidding each other along on
the road to ruin i thought tock gump
was going to start something and slid my
hand to the gun under my arm but he
only bowed and smiled and chattered to
buck

  that steward was a slimy devil like his
master he told buck that the rest of the
company had gone on to the palace and he
had come to escort us there so buck said
all right and motioned me to come along i
thought it was all over but i was wrong it
had not yet begun it was a private mat-
ter too

  when we got up to the palace the stew-
ard apologized mighty polite and asked if
we would step into the throne room we
stepped along thinking little of it and
found sultan lumpur transacting some bus-
iness the room was a gorgeous big place
with soldiers lined up on the sides and the
sultan sitting in a high canopied seat made
of gold none of our crowd was there at all

  tock gump said something and the sul-
tan ordered everybody out even the sol-
diers the only one left was the body-
guard lim perak and he stood right be-
hind the sultan watching us pretty close
then tock gump told the sultan about it


all-story weekly

  lumpur looked at us and grinned friend-
ly enough and spoke in english

   i am sorry you were troubled by the
impertinence of my steward he said in
the haw-haw fashion he had learned in
england  of course gentlemen a guest
is sacred and is welcome to whatever he may
desire and this bally rotter is hard to edu-
cate in such matters i apologize very pro-
fusely y know

   dont mention it sultan said buck
airily  there was no harm anyhow the
girl just passed the time of day with us and
was so obfusticated when she found that i
spoke malay that she grabbed my hand
and kissed it

the sultans monkey-face grinned again
 exactly old top said he  of course
since she has been contaminated by contact
with a foreigner she will be disposed of
and that ends it

  hold on exclaimed buck pretty
hasty  what do you mean contaminated
that is not very polite to us is it

  the sultan had not looked at it that way
and bucks argument disconcerted him of
course he was mad down under his silky
grin these malays are the worst you ever
saw for not letting their lady friends so
much as speak to another man but buck
went after him strong saying it was all his
fault and kapit ai perang should not be
punished and so forth until finally the sul-
tan seemed to agree with him

   very well my friend said lumpur
 of course we understand these things but
my subjects are a bit dense haw haw
ton my word old top it is very trying at
times so have patience and after two or
three days when she is properly adorned
and made ready kapit ai perang shall be
sent to you a present-a small token of
my favor eh what

  buck was stumped then right enough
since there were two or three days of
grace and he did not want to offend the
sultan buck said all right he would be
charmed and then we bowed and left the
royal presence i was rather curious to
know what buck aimed to do with the lady
when he got her home and what mrs buck
would say when he led her into the parlor
but buck says to shut up-he was short

and curt about it too so i did not press
the point

   saw leora that afternoon it was tre-
mendously hard to see anything of her
around that palace because marshall and
kelpy were both very fond of her company
and the sultan was already laying out a
program of entertainments in her honor
however i saw her for ten minutes without
any interruption and if it had not been for
my seeing her that way there is no telling
what might have happened to us all

  as it happened i was in the up-stairs cor-
ridor going to my own room as i passed
the door of the suite where leora and her
uncle were staying the door popped open
and out came miss graves she shut the
door and stood there staring at me

  i could see right off that something was
wrong she was as white as a sheet and
was trembling and shaky and stood look-
ing at me as if she was paralyzed her
breast heaved up and down and there was
the most terrible look in her blue eyes that
i had ever seen

 here i broke out whats the
matter

  she jumped then she called me by my
name for tlfe first time

  dave she whispered help-help
me to get away from here where is
uncle

  i dont know i said probably
around somewhere but what-

   listen ive just heard-heard the most
terrible things she broke off and closed
her eyes for a moment then looked at me
again i saw by her eyes that she wtas
horribly frightened yet underneath it she
was cool enough no hysterics or any-
thing like that

   what do you mean- i asked  about
buck and the lady

  she shook her head about-me i-
i wanted some water and-you know the
house telephone thats in all the rooms i
took it off the hook and pressed the button
for the stewards connection - and right
away i heard two men talking one was
the sultan and the other was-

   candelario  i exclaimed her eyes
widened

   how did you know
four quarts of rubies



   well i says  i know a lot of things
go on what did they say

   they were talking spanish she went
on growing a little calmer  and  under-
stand it pretty well - they were talking
about me dave oh i cant tell you-
i knew right then that she had uncovered
the sultans game and i was glad of it
buck and i had been worried about who
was going to tell her and how she would
take it

   well i broke in  dont try leora-
mean miss graves i know all about that
too we found out for certain about an
hour ago and i guess buck is trying to find
your uncle and fong tsai right now-

   theres no time to lose  she exclaimed
fear in her eyes again  it-its horrible
dave ive simply got to get away from
here to-night

  i thought it over quick and sudden i
did not see much sense in lingering around
the premises myself i was still in that
malay costume which i had come to like
pretty well by this time and as long as i
wore it they would think me unarmed and
helpless it looked to me as if i had better
take action myself and let fong tsai and
buck trail along

   all right i said to miss graves
 now its about three oclock and i judge
the sultan is taking his siesta he laid out
the program that way this morning-said
he always took a nap from about two thirty
to three thirty or four he was on the
phone from his room when you got in oh the
wire likely

   yes she said watching me  go
on

   youve got to act quick and sudden-
catch em by surprise i said  all we
want is to get aboard the schooner were
safe there youve got to make a stall that
you want to see the malay village down by
the river see once we get that far-
but no one speaks english except the
sultan she broke in  how can i talk
to them

   well i said  you leave that to me
well find a way somehow get your hat
and come along

  most girls i reckon would have asked
a lot of questions and hemmed and hawed

    	a-s

about what was proper and conventional
and all that but not leora no sin she
opened that door and ducked inside and in
two seconds she was back again with a straw
hat in her hand

   go ahead she said

  so i did what was mainly in my head
was to pick up kelpy and fong and the
rest on our way but nobody seemed in
their rooms as we passed and we went on
down-stairs whether we found the others
or not i meant to get leora safe aboard
the schooner without wasting any time but
i did want to collect the rest of our party

  as we got down-stairs i remembered
something and it made me feel sick on
the way in from the hunt just before buck
and i had paid our visit to kapit ai perang
i had heard professor graves and kelpy
talking to the sultan about visiting his
model plantations which lay a couple of
miles off to the north of the palace away
from the river so i judged that they had
all gone there and i was right fong had
gone too he being interested in such things
because he had a big rubber plantation of
his own somewhere near singapore the
only one who had not gone was buck and
we met him just as we came out on the
terraces and started toward the soldiers
quarters to rustle up a bullock cart

  lordy but i was glad to see old buck
drifting around there he came up to us
and  gave him no chance for any argument
but told him quickly what leora had heard
over the wire and where she was going

   now buck i says  none of your
talk shes going down to the schooner
and shes going this minute and youve got
to work it with the malays yonder get
her over to the river settlement and it 
be a cinch to lay out a boat and run down
the river-

   sure said buck sarcastically  ill
not interfere with your program dave it
looks pretty sensible to me but what
about graves and fong tsai theyll not
know what has taken place and the sultan
will sure permiscerate them out of revenge 

   all right i said giving him a shove
forward  you talk malay so you get
miss graves down to the schooner some-
how ill come over to the stables and


all-story weekly

wave good-by like i expected you back in
a few minutes then ill find fong and tip
him off leave that to me and buck-
if anything happens that you cant make
the ship run over to hell island and hide
in that treasure chamber and take a look at
the central stone maybe theres a hidden
spring that releases it

   you talk as if we had a motor-launch
said buck laughing  come along miss
graves well commigulate these malays
and get a bullock cart

  i was more or less worked up and earnest
about it but buck took the whole thing like
it was a joke and i was mighty proud of
the way he conducted himself on the way
over to the stables he chatted and laughed
and joked with miss graves but i noticed
that there was nothing loose about his voice
or his words now he had tightened up
considerably

  well when we got to the other buildings
out came the steward tock gump he and
buck conversed for a minute and i judged
the sultan had given orders that miss
graves was to have anything she wanted
because tock gump called out a bullock
cart in a hurry and six of the soldiers with
it buck protested at that and said that
he would sooner have the company of tock
gump than that of the soldiers which flat-
tered the fat steward and made him suspect
nothing so the soldiers stayed home and
tock gump climbed into the cart

   watch out for him i said to buck
 theyll obey him down at the village

   by the time we get there said buck
looking a little desperate  tock gump will
be somewhere else son good-by - and
good luck

  leora said she thought it was fine and
grand in me to stay behind to warn her
uncle and although she tried to be per-
fectly natural so tock gump would not
suspect anything her eyes were misty so
they got into the cart and we all waved otir
hands and laughed like it was nothing im-
portant and off they went

  i watched them out of sight i tell you
it made me feel blue to see them going that
way while i stayed behind to get old fong
out of it of course i was anxious about
graves but not in the same way

  not knowing what else to do i started
back to the palace all of a sudden some-
thing struck me as mighty queer-the stew-
ard tock gump being about the place
he had been sent to the schooner that
morning with traddle when had he re-
turned and why had we heard nothing more
about what he had done with traddle it
did not lookright to me the more i
thought about it the more worried i got

  at the palace there was no one to whom
i could talk because the sultan was not yet
on the job and he was the only one who
spoke english without a guide it would
be foolish for me to chase off into the jungle
trying to find the rest of the crowd so i
got my pipe and went out on the upper
terrace and took a chair

  from there i had a good view of every-
thing on the location the harem over
across the lake was enjoying some kind of
a hen party because i could hear music
and song but to the eye it was dead and
deserted i was just thinking about it and
wishing i could have a peep at what was
going on inside to see if the books told the
truth about such things when i saw a man
riding away from the stables and barracks
he was on horseback but i recognized him
right off and it was candelario

  some of the soldiers stopped him then i
saw him turn his horse and come toward me
by himself other soldiers were slouching
over toward the palace behind me but i
was mainly paying attention to candelario
his coming out in the open that way looked
bad however he did not seem to be
armed he rode his pony right out on the
second terrace a few feet below me and
waved his hand to me as he came along
he was grinning and the gold rings were
shaking in his ears as he jogged along

   hello senor he called his voice
mocking then he reined up close to me
 well i understand that you and you
alone know where the treasure is to be
found congratulations my caballero
come tell me the secret-and we shall share
it

  i told him where he could go and i said
a few more things as well hoping that he
would start something so that i could pull
my gun on him he got furious enough
such a nice man



for a minute then he laughed and rolled a
cigarette his dirty eyes fastened on me
when he had lighted it he blew out a thin
cloud of smoke and picked up his reins

   luckily for you my son he said silk-
ily  your life has been ordered spared-
for the present later perhaps we shall
talk of these things adieu senor i go to
bring back the charming senorita-and to
leave the foolish mr buck in the river 

  he waved his hand laughed and shook
his earrings and rode away i did not try
to stop him because he was in no hurry and
evidently suspected nothing at all of bucks
real errand he probably thought he would
find leora looking over the malay village
and buck interpreting for her as buck
was sure to be gone by the time he got
there i let him go

  there was no longer any doubt that
leora had got away just in the nick of time
some of the soldiers came down from the

palace gates where they were lounging and
looked me over pointing at the haft of my
broken kris and laughing i took out the
kris and when they saw it was broken
they laughed some more i started for the
palace but they would not let me leave the
terrace although they were respectful
enough then they loafed back toward the
gates again

  it was plain enough i was supposed not
to have any weapons and it was quite mani-
fest that i had none-only they did not
look under my armpit for that was a new
wrinkle to them i was to be kept here so
i could not get a gun but why what
had happened

  a moment later i knew from the malay
quarters came a burst of sharp yelping
shouts then i heard the drumming hoofs of
a galloping horse and turned around quick-
ly to see kelpy riding like the devil for the
palace

 that mild-faced lawyer hurriedly
 concluded a sentence to the stenographer at
 his elbow as he reached for the receiver

  yes

  hurry right in will you dan

 the voice was altogether too calm

  oh you back mcquillin yes yes

he sprang from his swivel-chair and almost
ran to the door swiftly directing as he did

all-story weekly

he sought hard to control his panic as he
entered joe mcquillins rooms

  the big handsome man at whose side he
had fought through many a legal battle sat
dejectedly at his desk his broad shoulders
hunched forward as macdonald entered
he raised a gray face and drew in his breath
quiveringly mechanically he reached for
his brier pipe and stuffed tobacco into the
bowl macdonalds heart throbbed in dumb
sympathy at the sturdy fight for non-
chalance  well joe

   yes drysdale has gone

  gone - actually gone gasped mac-
donald sinking into a chair

   he never even went up to michigan at
all he went-i dont know where

  the two lawyers numbed with appre-
hension it was so big a calamity that for
the moment its realization-chilled into
grim knowledge now that there was no
longer uncertainty-stupefied them like a
crushing physical blow joe mcquillin
puffed at the cold pipe he had forgotten to
light macdonalds plump face puckered
itself into lines of savage irony he gritted
sarcastically

   so j rankin drysdale of the law firm
of macdonald mcquillin and drysdale has
severed his connection with the firm with-
out the usual prosy formalities and his
silver tongue will no more-cajole-here-
abouts nice gentlemanly sort of fellow
that partner of ours true as steel

  the bitter ironical twist of speech ex-
hibited a familiar mannerism-the habit of
years his partner understood him as
though he had snarled a curse

   yes its as bad as that agreed mc-
quillin despairingly he sucked miserably
at his pipe the stamina had oozed out of
him and in the presence of the man who
had known him in his hours of strength the
virulent prosecuting attorney felt a grim
luxury in taking the count without even a
pretense of stolidity

  im-im flabbergasted dan lord
this is frightful

  macdonald got up hurriedly without an-
swering and went to a window he turned
slowly as mcquillin muttered

   i suppose you realize that-that were
completely done for

  it was an assertion but there was a
pitiful question-was there any hope-in
the low voice

  macdonald whistled tunelessly but said
nothing he was a mild commonplace
looking man with scant colorless hair and a
querulous trick of raised eyebrows his
remarkably successful career would have
proved a disconcerting problem to the
phrenologist yet there was a noticeable
breadth between his deep blue eyes the
ironical keenness of his mind had served
as a check on mcquillins impulsive irish
pugnacity

  the two made a law-court combination
that usually left dazed opponents trying to
explain to irate clients upon a signal vic-
tory macdonalds comment was the good
old firm did manage to blunder through
somehow

   yet i wonder he now queried mildly
 if weve got to the bottom of our genial
partners-borrowings-

  borrowings stormed mcquillin
clenching his big fists helplessly  dan say
what you mean-for once hes stolen
over seventy thousand dollars of our clients
money-thats what hes done and were
personally responsible for every cent of it
we simply cant make it up-cant begin to
make it up

  discovering the pipe in his hand he im-
patiently flung it on the desk and regretta-
bly profane he stormed on

   here weve been working along together
dan these twelve years side by side
bumping along against mighty heavy oppo-
sition the name of macdonald and mc-
quillin meant something when that damned
shyster drysdale came some imp of mis-
chief put it into my head to attend that
meeting of the american bar association
six years ago i heard drysdale speak in
one of the committees man man but he
could talk smart as a steel trap he
hypnotized me i suggested that he come
on to springfield-come in with us that
was the big mistake

   oh well now soothed macdonald
 you shouldnt-

   and you said something at the time
that should have warned me you said
you remember  so good a man needs no
such a nice man



past i didnt get you then you did not
want to chill my enthusiasm but-

   he looked pretty good to me too in
some ways

   and when we set him on former district
attorney robinson in the meagher murder
trial he carried us both off our feet-the
same as he did the whole court but-but
even then we should have kept him merely
on salary-like the others our rules would
then have required a bond from him but
we took him right into the firm-or rather
i did-and thus invited him to take our
financial life into his keeping trusted him
with the firms signature and a partners
power to act so that each member of the
firm is bound oh i thought a man could
trust his partner

   he can  said macdonald stubbornly
his eyes glinting  if that partners a man
like-like big joe mcquillin and not a
pirate

   i might have known two years ago
accused mcquillin  when i used to get
hints of his gambling tendencies-knocking
about with that fast bixby crowd damn
it i get to think a mans a man because ive
asked him to trust me

  mcquillin sat restlessly pounding his fist
on the corner of his desk

  macdonald admitted slowly  i had a
disquieting hunch at the time of nomination
for district attorney last year joe that
drysdales being thrust aside for you
rankled in that gentlemans manly bosom
he is not the less merry now in the thought
that this little coup of his will prove-er-
embarrassing to you

  mcquillins face sagged heavy with
anger the devilishness of it dan he
snarled  ill dig him out of his hole wher-
ever he is ill-ill-

  no proposed macdonald let me
see what i can do in the mean time we
must keep the thing under cover well try
to trace him too through your friend
masons agencies have our mr n brown
check up everything see exactly how far the
thing has gone

  yes yes well do all that but what
can you do mcquillins face was without
hope  hes spent the greater part of the
money by now no doubt and if we arrest

him or try to extradite him from some out-
landish place hell pull us into it with him
hell swear were all in-deep so in any
case its the ruin of us as a reputable law
firm even if our mealy-mouthed protes-
tations of being victimized would convince
some still-theyd pass us up-as suckers
a clerk entered extending a card
mcquillin glanced swiftly at it

   miss m v allen he gasped uneasily
 now what  hope her securities are
intact

   i didnt know that drysdale had charge
of those securities broke in the other
startled

   yes like a fool i-our n brown was
rushed to death with those expropriation
cases and i asked him to send in these mat-
ters to drysdales department

  interesting murmured macdonald
sardonically

  miss allen was courteously received as
befitted a rich client she sat primly on
the extreme edge of a deep-cushioned chair
and disregarding its invitation to ease
announced

  i find that mr drysdale-is absent
   ah yes he-

   and i thought it best to consult-to
bring this letter to you mr mcquillin i
cant understand it

  mcquillin reached out a polite hand his
hegrt was thumping what next

   i never authorized that letter com-
plained miss allen

  macdonald had reached the door when
mcquillins voice stopped him

  just a moment mr macdonald er-
allow me to -he glanced at the lady- to
make you acquainted with miss allen
macdonald had shut the door carefully
and had come back into the room he
bowed mcquillin explained

   miss allen is a daughter of the late
senator-

   yes

   this letter is from our firm to a mr
t e harley it is dated the th of april
we invested some thirty-two thousand dol-
lars of miss allens funds in a mortgage
from harley-

   yes

  mcquillin was puzzled at his partners


all-story weekly

pretense of ignorance he pondered a mo-
ment then went on

   the letter runs

 dear sir 

   your mortgage to miss m v allen is as you
know overdue and we are now instructed to re-
quire a payment on account of the same of at
least twenty thousand dollars by the tenth of
may next otherwise foreclosure proceedings will
be commenced

  trusting that we may not be forced to take
this extreme measure to protect our clients in-
terests

 yours very truly

 macdonald mcquillin and drysdale
per j r drysdale

  macdonald stifled an exclamation then
sat in grim silence

   mr harley came to me this morning
explained miss allen to the two lawyers
who sat intently listening  and asked me
not to press him further on the mortgage
he said that he had relied on my former
assurance to him that so long as i got the
interest promptly i would not compel him
for a while to withdraw his funds from his
business i assured him that i had not
instructed the firm to ask for payment and
that he might rest easy

  as expression of intense relief had laxed
the mobile features of joe mcquillin as the
lady explained he glanced at his partner
who nodded briefly

   there must have been some mistake
excused mcquillin  we have another
client a miss margaret allen-a niece of
mr allen of the consolidated electric-
and possibly our mr n brown who
handed these securities over to mr drys-
dale did not make it-er-clear to-

  the lady nodded  poor mr harley
had the greatest difficulty in raising the first
payment of twenty thousand-

   raising the twenty thousand-

   yes-that this letter asked for he
should have come to me then

   do i understand you miss allen to
say that harley raised twenty thousand
mcquillin spoke with difficulty as though
a hand were clutching at his throat

   why yes mr mcquillin he paid it
in to mr drysdale

  oh ah exactly

   and it was when he made this payment

that mr drysdale told him he would have
to have the balance in ten days

   humph-pardon me--i see said mc-
quillin

  the lady glanced curiously at the lawyer
then asked

   this twenty thousand dollars is still
i presume uninvested-unless you have-
just so broke in mcquillin ill
send for the papers in the matter and well
see how it stands he touched a bell
 we are extremely sorry that this mistake
should have-

   just one moment mr mcquillin in-
terrupted macdonald swiftly  i was about
to see our mr n brown on the-the
irving matter and  will personally ask
him to bring the papers he has the keys of
the security boxes

  he hurried out without waiting for a
reply encountering a clerk at the door he
dismissed him with a word presently he
returned empty-handed

   mr brown is at the equity court
will return at about three thirty he apolo-
gized  will you wait miss allen or i
might suggest that the matter-er-stand
as it is until mr drysdales return he
will have some satisfactory explanation
presumably in the mean time we will at
once write harley assuring him that he
need have no further uneasiness

   w-e- per-h-aps that would be as
well hesitated the lady  mr drysdale
is-well such a nice man i cannot think
that he has done this thing oppressively-
without reason

   oh he had the very best of reasons
i have no doubt of that jibed macdonald
bitterly  it will indeed be most humilia-
ting to him to realize that he has caused
unnecessary distress

  mcquillin stole a warning frown at his
ironic partner

  indeed sighed the spinster happily
confirmed in her personal estimate of the
dashing drysdale she just knew that a
cozy talk with rankin drysdale would
make everything right these prosy men
knew very little about their own office
affairs it would seem she was sure that
mr drysdale was much cleverer anyway
one felt such confidence in him
such a nice man



  as the door closed upon their fair client
macdonald put his back against it the set
look of studied professional decorum van-
ished from his tense face and he burst into
a sort of hysterical giggle

   it cannot be said with any degree of
exact truth that our esteemed associate is
a piker  he snickered bitterly  and how
ardently he wanted that other twelve thou-
sand-just to make it an even hundred
but he found it inadvisable to tarry his
face twisted into a rather pitiful grin  my
eloquent friend has a very taking disposi-
tion still much as i admire him i for
one did not wish to assume criminal as well
as civil liability for him

   how do you mean

   supposing you had got those papers
looked them over noticed some penciled
memo of the receipt of the twenty thousand
and admitted its receipt by the firm-which
you would have then been forced to do to
save our face-wouldnt that have linked
us up actually with the money instead of
as now only legally-as partners

  mcquillin nodded slowly im-im not
used to walking over thin ice with the men
i trust he excused  thank you old
man you kept your head

   everything else is gone though sighed
macdonald professional reputation-safe
as a church -oh hell it  be a scorcher 
mcquillin nodded dejectedly  dan im
about ready to-to cave in i cant stand
the gaff 

  he stopped by a window and when he
turned his face was set in hard lines of
resolve mens first impulses in crises are
much the same the fineness of a mans
stamina lies in the texture of his second
thought

   well stick by the wreck till-till hell
freezes over he gritted

   thats the way to talk man  exclaimed
macdonald  i-ets put on our workin clos
and jump right in business as usual
and till we see keep the thing under cover
ascertain the exact extent of the silver-
lipped drysdales expropriations might
have to test the securities send our check
statements-

   oh yes all that-after the horse has
been stolen

  mcquillin was suffering a slight relapse
from his sturdy resolve well who
wouldnt joe mcquillin was neither a
quitter nor a coward but a glimpse of his
home and all that it meant to him had
rushed across his vision it is unselfishness
not conscience that doth make cowards of
us all

  macdonald stood squinting moodily at
the others renewed dejection then shrug-
ging his shoulders he walked slowly to the
door there however he paused balanced
uncertainly then coming swiftly back
placed an unaccustomed hand on mcquil-
lins arm it was an awkward personal
caress deeply ashamed manlike in the
act yet he gritted his teeth and pulled off
the rest of the movie stunt his heart beating
oddly  buck up old horse dan mac-
donald and joe mcquillin have been
through some before this came weve got
our health were young and we can work
like wildcats we can pay this thing up in
three or four or five years--if we can
finance it somehow in the mean time ive
got about nine thousand and-

   couldnt get the money without se-
curity reminded mcquillin with the calm-
ness of absolute unbelief

   difficult i know might somehow
though well promise ourselves now for
all time anyhow that well climb onto the
water-wagon against intoxicating partners

  mcquillin glanced admiringly into his old
friends face here was a man and he
had been hard hit too

   what about your brother at college
sighed mcquillin sympathetically

  he can come home from college
snapped the other and went out slamming
the door

ii

  near the end of a busy afternoon in the
criminal court mcquillin trudged wearily
back to his offices and sought out his
partner

  macdonald was talking pleasantly to
arnold the drafting expert of the firm

   and locked up by a charming yet
chilly testamentary oversight

  macdonald paused and lit a cigarette
arnold red as a poppy broke in hurriedly


all-story weekly

  i will-perhaps id better consider this
 -and prepare another draft-

 as the crestfallen attorney hurried out
 chidden but grateful macdonald turned
 nonchalantly to his partner

  well

  oh the court a good day enough
 but-

  no  buts joe till the big splash
 a clerk knocked

  mr mccracken of mccracken hines
 and risinger wishes to see you mr mc-
 quillin

  tell him to come on in here

 mr mccracken appeared in the door-
 way smirking his perpetual smirk he was
 a little squat oily lawyer with a hard
 mouth and a harder eye he grudged
 mcquillins force and macdonalds re-
 straint and despised them both for their
 rectitude deep down in his soul he envied
 them this quality and deeper still he hated
 himself for his envy he was a brilliant
 shyster

  mr drysdale is away i learn

    yes mccracken

  ah that matter of the pulp limits in
 michigan-

  yes our mr drysdale went up to look
 into the matter

  oh no he started but just before
 he got off i met his offer for an option

  wha-at

  oh didnt he tell you yes i paid
 him five thousand dollars to bind the bar-
 gain

 mcquillin flinched then swiftly

  at what figure

  seven hundred and fifty thousand
 mcquillin and macdonald were past
 mere gasping they felt like aloof specta-
 tors queerly unconcerned with their own
 doom

 oh and do you happen to have the
 -the option with you

  sure i brought it over to close the
 deal

 mcquillin scanned it  our client colo-
 nel manning had previously i believe been
 holding out for seven hundred and sixty-five
 thousand

 mcquillin paused and glanced dully at
 his partner who grinned sardonically

  i know that smirked mccracken
 and in fact drysdale told me several
times that colonel manning would not take
a cent less at last he told me that he was
being sent up there to get a first-hand
opinion but that same afternoon-it was
the last tuesday week-drysdale came to
me and stated that the colonel had changed
his mind-i dont know why-and so we
closed the deal

  mcquillin blinked  yes well there
was some other business that drysdale had
to attend to it seems

  mccracken smirked with unusual gusto
his little eyes snapped at some hidden jest
 when can you have colonel mannings
conveyance ready gentlemen

   perhaps wed better wait till-till mr
drysdale comes back suggested mac-
donald  hes in personal touch with the
affairs and its in his department i per-
sonally dont know very much about it

   nor i said mcquillin remembering
the harley mortgage

   well all right-for the time hesitated
mccracken  but my clients wish to have
the papers in such form that they may use
them with their bankers as collateral-
mccracken left his sentence unfinished
pursed his thick lips smirked and started to
go out he paused at the door and scruti-
nized the two men covertly  the colonel
climbed down mighty sudden drysdale
acted as though he had instructions to get
the ready money as soon as possible per-
haps the colonel needs it drysdale wanted
a deposit of ten thousand but i thought
five would cover the possible damages for a
months option youd better get in touch
with the colonel or i will

   the matter will naturally receive our
immediate  and foremost attention
snapped macdonald

  mccracken smirked an oily farewell and
retired

  mcquillin sank into a chair and stared
heavily at his partner macdonald turned
to his desk and snatching up a pen calcu-
lated whimsically

  lets see i made about fifty-five dollars
to-day how much did you make old top
gaily he grinned banteringly at his part-
ner daring him to be glum
such a nice man



   why-oh i dont know why about
a hundred i spose

   then lets see now suggested mac-
donald  heres a sum for your boy bob
hes ten isnt he good if one lawyer
earns one hundred per day and the other
fifty-five then if they both work like hell
for three years and have luck by what
amount will they fall short of making up
the sum of-whats the whole thing come
to

  whats the use growled mcquillin
his boy bob his partner had inadver-
tently touched him on the very quick of his
despair

  macdonald took his cigarette from the
little tray at his elbow relit it carefully
ejected a soothing cloud of smoke from the
depths of sentient being and essayed a bit
of song

    when you come to the end oj the
perfect day- 

  a phonographic flattening of the high
notes rasped mcquillins frayed nerves be-
yond endurance

   stop it for gods sake man i-

   why certainly yet music can express
subtler feelings than mere words-which
sometimes seem inadequate then per-
sistently that makes-lets see ninety
thousand plus five plus what weve got to
make up to colonel manning to meet his
minimum price say fifteen thousand equals
the charming sum of one hundred and ten
thousand oh frabjous day cal-

   go to blazes said mcquillin

iii

  forty-three hours later macdonald set
out on foot from a hotel in woodsville new
hampshire the drysdale homestead was
he had been credibly informed about a mile
right along that road cant miss it a big
red-brick house settin down in a hollow

  five minutes later he found himself glibly
explaining his presence to the father and
mother of his former partner

   came up here on business he said
glancing keenly at the pale bearded face of
drysdale senior  and before i left your
son -he turned and smiled genially at the
tired new england mother who sat listening

with a sort of wistful eagerness to her sons
law-partner from the city- he asked me
to call and see his mother and father-and
his little sister -glancing with concealed
pity at a delicate child of fourteen who lay
stretched upon a couch in the shabbily clean
living-room- and-

   rankie has been away from springfield
since-when was it john asked the tired
little woman of her husband

   nearly two weeks i think said the
father  he wrote your sister nora from
san francisco-

  ah yes swiftly interposed macdon-
ald  we had been planning this trip
of mine for-for some time

   and rankie spoke in the letter of going
to-what was the name of the place in
south america john

   uraqua hazarded the father

   ah uruguay suggested macdonald
with sinking heart now that he had a
hint he put into his question something of
the force of a statement it wouldnt do
to show ignorance of such an important
trip

   yes mr macdonald on some very
important business matter-

   of a very delicate and personal na-
ture sneered the lawyer

   its-its nice that rankie is getting
along so well with you-these years
uruguay

  yes oh splendid he has done so
much for us he had

  probably no extradition from that place
 im so glad sighed the little woman
 uncle george -to an old unkempt
shabbily dressed man who had slouched into
the room- mr macdonald of ranlcies
law firm you know

  the old gentleman put out a bony hand
 how long has he been with you mr
macdonald

   some six years sir

   humph grunted the old man glanc-
ing sharply at the lawyer with an enigmati-
cal grimace	
 well mused macdonald his eye de-
spairingly upon the faded rugs the carefully
darned window-curtains through which the
sun softly caressed the wan little girls
transparent fingers  theres nothing to


all-story weekly

hope for here our silver-tongued friend
has been here first judge eastman told
me the place was mortgaged to the cupola
it looks it

  and there were spiritual mortgages here
too on the mothers face he had been
reading the settled look of astonished in-
credulity that her boy her pride had not-
yet-fulfilled those whispered sacred prom-
ises whose non-fulfillment left her wonder-
ing wondering there was too the money
he had promised to send-oh it was two
years ago now-so that that expensive oper-
ation might be performed for the little sister
that would make her-god willing-well
and strong again running about among the
flowers dancing up the path ah the
tears came her puritan austerity scolded
them back

   he-my son-is doing quite well-
pardon a mothers inquisitiveness-quite
well-with you financially

  macdonald was fidgeting to get away
from this house of hope deferred it
made his heart sick the whole place
spelled disappointed hopes sacrifice at the
futility of which devils gibed

  his own trouble-arising out of the
same cause-obsessed him a bitterness
burned in his brain twenty years of de-
cent living and hard-earned success crip-
pled by the airy passing of a degenerate
as he reached for his hat and stick he
answered with a veiled characteristic bitter-
ness  financially why hes in a fair
way to become rich

  he went over and bent down to the little
girl  i-i hope you dont suff-that you
are resting easily

  she put out a wan hand and smiled
her eyes were clear and candid like her
mothers

  mrs drysdale stole a searching glance at
macdonalds serious face she seemed sat-
isfied and explained

   an operation is necessary the doctors
say uncle george -she paused a mo-
ment and looked over to where the two
men were complainingly discussing the
drought- uncle george says that to med-
dle with gods dispensations is-wicked and
blasphemous but then uncle george is
old-fashioned queer i wish he-

  she stopped and stood biting her twitch-
ing lips the girl placed a white hand on
her arm caressingly  never mind mum-
sy dont bother things will come out
right im sure of it

  the mother absently patted the girls
thin arm

   mr macdonald i am going to ask you
to - to find a good opportunity - when
rankie is not too busy-and tell him about
his sister he knows of course but-but
hes so busy so ambitious men have to
be-heedless-a little-dont you think-
self-centered to succeed what a special
pleader is a mother when a sons honor is
at stake  but his heart is torn by all this
-he has said so to me in such beautiful
letters i could show you-

   i see murmured macdonald chilled
to the heart  of course

   so-wont you-you will-tactfully-
explain

   i will explain-as soon as i have an
opportunity 

  when he turned away from the couch
his teeth were clenched and he fiercely
blinked his eyelids

   ill be moving along now how good
it is to see drysdales folks little visits
like these -cheerily courteous- well
they are like oases in the desert of profes-
sional-dryness 

  the father broke in heartily  cant you
stay a day or two stay and go fishing
he had not risen from his rheumatic chair
 rankin used to enjoy these streams-

   why not mr macdonald joined in
the mother  take pot-luck with us
some one who had been near rankie-
but macdonald pleading pressure of
business bade them good-by the old
uncle trudged along the road with him

   great day isnt it too fast for you
sir

   no  said the old man sturdily length-
ening his stride

  the two moved along through the after-
noon sunshine the air was balmy birds
sang nature was gracefully erect there
seemed no room for sense of wrong and
yet men-

  gone to uruguay the damned scoun-
drel the actual knowledge was a decisive
such a nice man



and final adjudication on macdonalds faint
hopes that somehow-yet-some unex-
pected twist of whimsy event might bring
all out-decent a great laugh at a bad
scare and- but uruguay

   the boy was somewhat of a-in fact-
i shouldnt say this mr macdonald an
old mans scolding tongue-a deep disap-
pointment to his folks but it appears
that during the six years he had been with
you he has developed got over his excesses
-yes-mere excesses-and grown into a
man a man provident and honorable-

  half-heartedly macdonald listened to the
old mans chatter it was all of a piece
wistful hopes a fierce tenacious wish to
think well of the boy who had laid the
family low

  oh honorable why mark twain
once described a character as possessing a
hare-lip a kind heart and everybody said
he was as true as steel well rankie
hasnt the hare-lip-

   ah  cackled his companion

  at the hotel macdonald absently shook
hands with the old farmer he ascertained
the address of the aunt of whom mr
drysdale had spoken there was a slight
chance

  he then had a long hopeless interview
with judge eastman who providentially
persuaded him to spend the evening with
him and take the early morning train for
concord well there were plans to make
before he played his last card he would
wait

  we have said providentially for as mac-
donald lit a cigarette and glanced at the
morning paper in the smoker the next morn-
ing he noted that the evening train had
been wrecked some vague details two or
three killed many injured  a mans in
luck so long as he keeps alive he mused
optimistically

  the aunt mrs colthurd was a comely
woman of forty she folded her large capa-
ble hands in her lap and listened quietly
to the tale that macdonald after a minutes
scrutiny of the womans face felt perfectly
free to tell her she nodded from time
to time in sad understanding

   yes said she  i know i know

   i-we are in desperate straits mrs

colthurd i could not forego employing
every means within my reach-

   it is-dreadful have you told-you
have not told the father and mother

   no

   then why me

  because-we lawyers can judge-
then with a wince  yes i know but a
partner is-a partner we trust a part-
ner 

   i know said the woman again then
she sighed and explained

   i have lent money to rankie till he
has-bled me white i have paid for his
youthful scrapes i even lent him money
to go to springfield when you people took
him up i was so hopeful that he would
do well there he promised at any rate
that i would not have to bother about the
interest on the mortgage-

  you mortgaged

   yes and i am a little doubtful if i
shall be able to pay the interest money this
summer still i may manage she twisted
her long capable fingers about each other
nervously  i am well and strong and
 have a boy growing up who is going to
help me all he can of course he was to
have-

  gone to college snapped macdonald
with a scowl

   well yes-dental school but rankie
was the familys hope he was-in our
foolish hearts-we thought great tilings for
rankie

  macdonald took up his hat and snarled
into it

   rankie is that sort of chap to justify
the sacrifice of many obscure lives in order
that he-exist beautifully

   i beg your pardon oh i see you
are ironic oh well-

  the woman smiled then sighed and her
eyes grew full of wistfulness she looked
at a large photograph of the hope of the
house it beamed out from its ornate frame
on the old-fashioned center table-superb
 such promise  she sighed

   really i do think yet that-

  oh certainly he is-er-a king
among men i really beg your pardon
forgive me-i had not meant- for the
woman was crying


all-story weekly

  he went out quickly cursing beneath his
breath

  he took the next train back to woods-
vilie and wired non-progress to his partner
he ended laconically  whats the score

iv

  grimly standing the gaff somehow mc-
quillin maneuvered through the next four
days twice he sent out frantic s o s
messages to his partner what in the world
was the man doing why was he loitering
about in new hampshire his carefully
worded messages brought back but vague
responses hold her down hold her
down it was mighty hard work it was
a matter now of hours

  tuesday morning at ten fifteen macdon-
ald suddenly appeared at the door of mc-
quillins rooms and tossed his attorneys
bag carelessly to one side there was no
greeting between the two the soul is raw-
ly awake in crises the petty and non-
essential go by default

  mcquillin tossed a letter to him  read
that he grunted

  eh when did you get this

   this morning

   well well from our bold and way-
ward boy orator eh lets see-whats
he say he studied the address again
then read slowly

 en route for south america

 my dear ex-partners 

  you have no doubt by this time-by means
of your unusually efficient bookkeeping system-
debited me with some  against this
j presume that your mr mcquillin will be glad
to make a credit entry as follows  compensa-
tion allowed mr drysdale re giving way for mc-
quillin on nomination for district attorney say
 then as to balance the present heavy
rates of exchange deter me from remitting this at
present in the mean time i feel that during the
time i was with your firm my services were
worth far more than i received and that the
account is practically square

   for youf solace  may say that i am in
funds

    a letter sent to buenos aires will be forward-
ed to me do write any agency business you
have in this south country you have but to
command me

               yours sincerely

 j rankin drysdale

  the damned insolent pup stormed
mcquillin

   the other silently reread the letter

    interesting a very interesting letter 
he announced  have you answered it
 id like to answer it in person  snarled
mcquillin  well extradite him-
macdonald grinned  hell land in some
unextraditable country trust him he
sat silently tapping the letter on the desk
at length he arose

  tut-joe he scolded our corre-
spondents should be treated with unfailing
courtesy and especially our foreign cor-
respondents this letter must be answered
at once

  he went over to the corner of the room
lifted a leather cover from a typewriter
and found some letter-paper and carbon
he began clumsily to pick out the letters
on the keyboard

  mcquillin eyed him disgustedly what
a curious make-up

   for lords sake dan if youre going
to acknowledge that cussed letter get one
of the girls in and dictate it

  macdonald grinned whimsically  i
havent done much at this for several years
i admit he said back-spacing to remedy
a wrong letter  but here is something i
have headed  private and confidential-
unless you wish otherwise and so ive got
to dig the letters out myself

  mcquillin complained  well then why
not a little later this damn situation-
ive held it down in a kind of way till this
morning but somethings got to be done
right off i dont know how you do it
dan  as his partner continued to painfully
indicate on the keyboard his preferences of
spelling

  youre a queer make-up

  mcquillin returned to his desk sat heav-
ily down and passed a nervous hand over his
forehead how the temples throbbed he
knew macdonald-he knew him well but
this-triviality it puzzled him was the
man as big as he had thought him wasnt
he after all a sort of personified irony-a
sneer nothing substantial behind it-no
human feelings

  at length macdonald ripped a second
sheet from the machine and gathering up
such a nice man



the papers came over to mcquillins desk
lit a cigarette and taking up the letter said
 want to hear this a nice chatty let-
ter you wont understand some of the de-
tails-ill explain them later however
youll catch the gist of it

our dear mr drysdale

   your lettar received this morning we note
with poignant regret that you have severed your
connection with this firm but hope that you will
prosper in the south country and speedily attain
to some position in a public institution there
which your varied talents had already qualified
you for here-had you remained

   and now for some news dear comrade our
mr macdonald had occasion recently to go up
to new hampshire and while sojourning in your
native state he visited your people he saw
your mother whose hands were rough with house-
hold drudgery which had you but witnessed it
your filial heart would have been cruelly torn
your father crippled with rheumatism your little
sister fading awaiting the money that would give
her back her life through a simple though somewhat
expensive operation your aunt worrying over ma-
turing interest which you had inadvertently omit-
ted to send her all this our mr macdonald saw
-and his heart bled for you poor wanderer
your uncle george-a kind though uncouth old
gentleman-is dead he was killed in a train-
wreck last week on his way home from a brief
visit at your fathers our mr macdonald had
an opportunity of conversing with him only a few
hours before he was killed he was an interest-
ing old gentleman rather eccentric and with
strong notions shortly after our mr macdonald
partedwith him at the hotel your uncle went to
his solicitor judge eastman and executed a new
will the former one had given his surprisingly
large estate some  in readily converti-
ble bonds to certain rather eccentric charities but
somehow-and our mr macdonald does not quite
comprehend yet-your uncle gathered from our
mr macdonalds remarks that you had now ac-
quired certain admirable qualities formerly con-
spicuously absent our mr macdonald admits
a tendency in himself to be ironical-at times-
and it may be that your uncle did not quite catch
the veiled pathos of his remarks the upshot of
it all is anyhow that it served to shift the current
of his testamentary intentions and he left the
whole estate to you-

   good heavens is that true then
we can- burst in mcquillin

   we have remarked macdonald calm-
ly  listen to the sweet tidings

  therefore you need not fret over the heavy
rates of exchange for the will having been duly
probated with judge eastman as executor we

have filed an attaching order against your for-
tunate legacy for the amount of 
which your letter this morning admits to be due
us so this will very nearly square our account

   dan shouted mcquillin grasping his
partners hand in an excess of jubilance
 whv were saved youre a wonder
you-

   listen joe interposed macdonald
 the worst is yet to come

   we have however in addition to the above
included in the attaching order against your legacy
the following items paid by us at your implied
request namely

money paid to hospital in boston to
cover expenses operation re your sister 
money paid your father for treatment

 at hot springs  

money paid your mother to employ scul-
  lery maid et cetera  

money paid being balance of principal

  and interest on homestead  

money paid being balance of principal
  and interest on your aunts property 



   these items are as we say paid by us at your
implied request from our happy intimacy with
you we felt that were you on the spot the
money would have been so employed we have
taken the occasion to witness the gratitude and
tender love which is singing in the hearts of your
folks over your loving care they have en-
throned you in their souls as indeed their king
the hope of the homestead our mr mac-
donald is visualizing your warm gratitude when
you learn of his brotherly act on our part
oh thats all right dont mention it we know
that you would do the same by us what is life
anyhow without loyalty to ones friends there
there spare our blushes

   if for any reason-which we find it difficult
to think-you feel disposed to contest the legality
of these payments you have only to return to the
united states to fight the same and in that event
we can assure you of a warm welcome i

   as you assure us that you are in funds it will
be agreeable to you to know that judge eastman
-calculating to a nicety-figures that there will
remain-after all payments are made and com-
missions and expenses are deducted-some thirty-
five or forty dollars-the balance of your splendid
legacy we congratulate you again on the re-
markable outcome of our mj macdonalds chat
with your late uncle it has saved you several
perfectly good dollars-by way of exchange
and these little things are so annoying yours
with equal sincerity

preceding chapters briefly retold

through the medium of a fighl in a saki-shop on the japanese island of kyushu and lynn
the aid of a british official jim gurney wastrel was asked by a british government official
to make a  clean-up  of a gang of pcarlpirates and all-round criminals lead by a woman of
unusual beauty who made their headquarters on the island of tarani jim accepted and resolved
to make a clean-up of his life too in a small boat and supplied with pistols binoculars and
some supplies he was purposely cast up on the beach of tarani but he miscalculated the strength
of the sea and was rescued by barbara the eighteen-year-old daughter of ronald goff an english
trader

    barbara had been brought up as a child of nature free from conventions of any sort her
father still regarded her as a child and so did jim but she objected to that she was an expert
swimmer and helped jim salvage the contents of his boat including his pistols goff had natives
build jim a house and jim helped barbara build a new canoe one night some no-good whites
who lived on the other side of the island came to goffs store and while jim was sitting alone
before his hut a woman of rare but barbaric beauty came to him and suggested that he leave the
island jim laughed at her and later his house was set afire and partially destroyed

    next day jim went into the mountains and was captured by some of the womans followers
from whose conversation he learned that she was mme miriam jobert the leader of the gang
after a fierce fight he was left on the beach to die hut slipped out of his bonds and started to
swim to his hut mme jobert covered him with a pistol-but didnt fire

    barbara had budded into womanhood suddenly and loved jim she had seen his capture
and arrived in her canoe in time to save him from drowning yet when she changed her usual
unconventional attire for the clothing of civilization jim gave her but passing notice-and for a
moment she hated him but her father realized that she was no longer a child

    while jim was sitting in front of his repaired hut in the moonlight mme jobert appeared
to him again  i come in peace she said  such a night lends itself to such words as i shall
say to you man of the lion heart

a visit of peace

gurney fell into his hammock in
mock astonishment at her high-

	down speech and began humming
 just before the battle mother but his
indirect derision fell very flat silence alone
came from the shadowy corner where the
woman had seated herself on a box but
through the very silence itself quivered and
crept a strange insidious quality which
worked a spell upon gurney and speedily
changed his mood to one of more or less
embarrassed attention an electric tremor
attacked him and he stole a glance at that
dim corner to shiver more acutely at the
queerly luminous eyes that regarded him

unwinkingly from the gloom visible when
all else was invisible

  for some moments the silence held un-
broken after his humming ceased and for
all his worldly experience a cold moisture
broke upon his forehead then as if at a
cleverly chosen instant the woman uttered
a low seductive laugh and reached out her
hand to gently touch his face he started
but subsided again as she spoke vibrantly
 i have sought such a man as you for
years such mortals are not made in dupli-
cate i have need of you serve me and
you may place your desires as high as high
heaven speak to me

  the soft hand at his face moved with a
caress in every pink finger tip the vague
shape beside him came nearer - and the

this story began in the all-story weekly for may 

                           
the clean-up



beautiful face with its alluring eyes leaned
close to his the woman emanated an in-
toxicating aura of utter desirability warm
and of exquisite perfume her smile was
rendered clear to him even in the shadows
by the glistening of her moist red lips

  when she spoke first he had felt a jump-
ing elation in the prospect of actual con-
test with this his arch opponent as she
proceeded the chords of his being leaped
from disuse into hot response to her mood
for she had taken the line by chance or by
clever selection best calculated to discover
his vulnerable points as he had confessed
to lynn in moji gurneys somewhat hectic
life had been largely spent in more or less
sweet dalliance with women whose trade
was that of thais and the red corpuscles in
his blood ever leaped into hot eruption at
touch of such hands as now trembled on his
cheeks

  but he had undertaken his present task
in no idle moment knowing every cir-
cumstance even to the presence on tarani
of such a woman he had seized the chance
to make a clean-up in his life while per-
forming that other clean-up so close to the
heart of his employer and the remem-
brance came to him in the same flashing
moment as he recalled what he had already
suffered at these caressing hands brush-
ing her fingers aside from his lips with a
shiver he flung his feet out of the hammock
and sat on the edge staring hard into her
glowing eyes and rallying his wits to meet
her seductive mood with one of brutal
sarcasm

   you have looked for a man like me for
years he mocked  yes to burn him
alive to have him lashed fast where the
sea and sun could boil and fry his marrow
oh i know how you must have looked for
me and serve you you say place my
desires as high as heaven i aim higher
than that right now there is nothing in
your power to give that which can compare
with the prize i aim at

   and what is that pray came the
whisper sweeter more seductive than ever
gurney shook himself savagely to throw off
the spell of her

   that is my own affair lady he re-
turned bruskly  and if i may repeat a

question i put before who in thunder are
you that  must consider you at all

  the woman laughed deliciously at his
method of meeting her advances she
seemed to be hugely gratified as if she had
sought to arouse in him just such a temper
she permitted a period of throbbing silence
to intervene again before she spoke and
then her words brought gurney sharply out
of the maze of his conflicting thoughts

   please give me some water will you
a simple request made in a simple tone
not to be refused jim got out of the
hammock and fetched water from the terra-
cotta jar that always swung in the breeze
under the eaves of the hut when he re-
entered the dim room the woman had
usurped the hammock and swung easily
back and forth the embodiment of feline
grace she took the pannikin of water with
a word of thanks and he sat down on the
box she had vacated it was nearer to the
hammock than before he moved it back
and she gurgled with delight

   you are difficult my friend she said
handing him the water vessel to set down
 let us see perhaps we shall yet be good
friends come nearer i will answer all
those questions you have asked me come
i do not bite

  fire away growled jim uneasily
 im not deaf

   as you will then first i am in
thunder or in sunshine miriam jobert
you i remember told me you are called
jim gurney i shall call you jim i am
miriam to you if you like jim-that is a
name with charming possibilities when ut-
tered by the proper tongue jim  -she
gave the name a bewitching little french
accent and it sounded like music even to
gurneys stubborn ears- jim i like it
it is good

   so jim that is one question answered
and we are correctly acquainted are we
not let us go on as miriam jobert i
am mistress of tarani and her people-
like fun you are blurted jim de-
risively

   i am mistress of tarani and her
people she went on with a little frown
that was swiftly changed into a smile
 goff the trader is not of taranis people
s

all-story weekly

nor are you-yet the natives recognize in
me the supreme power over them the other
people are my own people some of whom
you have encountered

  a very pretty crowd lady a nice clean
villainous mob of piratical scum i con-
gratulate you on your subjects your im-
perial highness carry on

   i am so glad you appreciate my fel-
lows jim she rippled  it makes easier
what i shall presently say now let me
tell you why on various occasions you
escaped death by bullet what did you do
when you found your hut on fire i had
hoped you were inside but since you were
not i watched every movement you made
do you recall your actions

   no then i will tell you you did
not run madly to put out the fire that was
destroying your entire belongings you first
sought out the agent and paid the bill be-
fore taking stock of damages that was the
first hint i received of your difference from
other men then the man i had sent to
burn you out joe was the hardiest most
formidable of my fighting ruffians and
ought to have handled you like a baby
but did he no my jim i saw you make
clay with him

   one shot was fired at you-not by my
hand-then i stopped the shooting and
watched you fight i saw my fighting man
made to put out the fire he had made and
i ran away from my rascals in order to
laugh with exultation so you were not
shot that night jim because i knew i had
looked upon a man and why were you
not shot later when i came upon the ledge
just as you had slipped from it

   search me i couldnt guess that any
more than i could guess why you should
want to broil me alive after discovering
that i was such a lallapaloosa of a man
make it short tell your tale

   i will years of habit are not to be
lightly obliterated by one swift circum-
stance jim when i thought more deeply
i knew i could not afford to have a stranger
here no matter what breed of champion he
might be my men would not submit to it
and above all things my domain here is
one surrounded by perils you can know
nothing of

   i decided that you must go and since
you appeared unlikely to quit the island
willingly i ordered your removal in the
manner you saw

   charming creature pity you couldnt
find a man who kept tigers for pets to
marry you but i guess tigers couldnt
teach you anything

   droll jim she laughed and patted
his arm  have you not heard that in love
or hate a woman knows no limits i hated
you when you almost defeated my men
bound though you were but do you think
i could lose sight of the terrific courage in
you your indomitable spirit appealed to
me your bold contempt of myself and my
people enraged me between two fires of
hate and-let us call it for the present
admiration-i at length determined to let
you suffer the penalty allotted to you

   so i went down to the ledge at meridian
of the moon to feast upon your torments
yoy had escaped even that deadly net and
in my anger humiliation too i would have
shot you but above all else anger hu-
miliation i saw again the man of men who
alone could serve me in my increasingly
difficult situation thus you know why
you were not shot in the moment of your
flight jim

  gurney had listened with keen curiosity
for he had not hitherto encountered an
antagonist who refused to seize the chance
to jump on his neck when down and
through the curiosity there leaped the con-
viction that this astounding woman would
overreach herself and impart more than she
intended did he but play her at her own
game but that seemed difficult he was
too much like tinder and not enough like
flint to join battle successfully with steel

  he edged his box closer however and
tried to ask without eagerness  and what
lies back of this miriam her hand
stroked his face softly when her name came
from his lips she positively purred and
he thrilled to her touch in spite of his re-
solve to fight her wiles with skill like her
own  i understand all you have said and
appreciate it of course but tell me how

i	can serve you want me to fight some-
body

  he uttered the last sentence jerkily for
the clean-up



it hd cost him an effort but with it he
recovered some of his control it was at
all events far removed from her own sug-
gestive line of conversation

   perhaps she replied and now there
was a languorous note in her speech he
knew those great eyes half closed though
they were now never left his face her
hand moved softly upon his forearm she
spoke as if in dreamy reminiscence but he
knew she was speaking straight out from a
hot imperious heart the dreaminess but a
cloak

   perhaps she said again  by enter-
ing my service jim you can be master of
my affairs and they are far-reaching in-
deed those rough men you saw are but a
small part of my people a hundred such
call me mistress and do my bidding my
wealth is such that a prince might well turn
pirate to secure it but i want none of
your princes or pirates i have governed
these men of tarani by my own will they
render me dumb obedience my business
with the outer world goes on and remains
secret

   goff yonder has lived here for more
years than a woman of my age cares to
count yet how much does he know of me
nothing-less than nothing if you won-
der why he is permitted to stay i will tell
you that he is useful to me through his
very indifference to me once a year he
receives stores he supplies my community
and i am saved the necessity of visiting
pprts for supplies through which i might be
traced here

  but jim -she put a thrill into her
voice now and leaned over until her warm
body touched his shoulder and her hair
brushed his temples- i am weary of my
lot i am lonely and need a strong heart
on which to lean until  saw you fight i
derided the thought of any man on earth
being fit to mate with me now i know i
have met my mate and oh jim i want
you up there to be my king

  at the first touch of her body against
him gurney got up from his box with a
bound and she uttered a little cry of alarm
and anger when his sudden removal almost
dropped her from the hammock he swift-
ly got matches and lighted the lamp trem-
 a-s

bling and in a cold sweat but determined
to avoid the toils she spread for him the
light shone on her face white as chalk from
which her blazing eyes glittered in raging
humiliation

   sorry miss miriam but the king busi-
ness aint what it was before the war i
like a fight thats true and maybe we can
get together some time in that way but call
off the king stuff for your truly jim
gurney

  she sprang from the hammock and stood
before him panting heavily then with
tremendous will she governed herself and
showed him her smiling face again not soft
or seductive but quizzically humorous

   so the prospect of being miriams king
frightens you eh

   dont say frightens he retorted
 nothing frightens me say rather i dont
want any part of your business and youll
hit it all this secret community stuff al-
ways makes me feel like taking my gun and
going hunting on the mountain

  there was a struggle in her face a strug-
gle between hot-rage and cool-reason not
lightly had she taken the step to offer him
partnership her end must not be defeated
by undue hastiness of temper she regarded
him curiously jor a moment and he gave
her back look for look then there was an
interruption that wrenched them both out
of their pose of wariness of each other

  a sharp little cry burst from the open
door and both turned as one to see framed
in the entrance the wide-eyed dark-flushed
face of barbara staring at them both in
unbelieving amaze

  hello barbara greeted jim then
stopped for the girl presented a picture of
awful disillusionment slightly crouched
forward her lips were open in a round
 o  like an opened rose in the dark pools
of her eyes shone a glitter cold as the
stars at the bosom of her white dress the
laces billowed like waves over her pant-
ing breast her small brown hands were
clenched so that the knuckles shone white
through the skin with a sharp wrench
she summoned back her wandering powers
of motion and casting a glance of hatred
at the woman and a pitying stare at jim
she gathered up her fine white skirt and

plunged madly along the beach sobbing

jealousy

for a moment he stood speechless then
laughing awkwardly jim turned from
the door

  wonder whats the matter with barbara
now he grinned  too bad to see her
like that shes a bully little kid

  miriam regarded him sharply suspicion
in her darkened face so they stood for a
long breath each searching the other he
with curiosity as to the cause of her shat-
tered calm she with rising evidence that
she believed he was shrewdly playing with
her her figure quivered and her breast
heaved as she steadied herself and in a
voice of deadly earnestness she flared

   bully little kid idiot she is a wo-
man-a pulsing passionate woman-fruit
ripened overnight from a wild blossom
kid-

  gurney was grinning at her now in his
impudent face was all his own wilful dis-
regard of barbaras claim to maturity re-
enforced by irrepressible amusement at the
womans anger his grin brought swift re-
sponse and the situation tensed she
glared at him more fiercely and raved

   you sneering dog and blind that i
have been so there lies the reason for
your slighting of my proffered favor that
wild island girl-kid you name her with
lying lips while your false heart knows her
a woman-she is your flame your- jims
face hardened and danger flashed from his
gray eyes she ignored the signals and
raved on  she is your woman eh

   then hear me beachcomber again i
tell you this island shall not hold us both
leave while you are able for from this
moment it is war between us-war that can
only end when with death at your heart
that insolent sneer dies on your face

  her tone snatched gurney back to cool
poise and now that threats were in order
he felt his old-time elation at battle-pros-
pects he dismissed the fury that had
seized him when barbaras name was being

hurled at him in insult and joyfully took
up the gauntlet flung down before him

   madam flatters me he mocked and
bowed theatrical   on with the war
lady let death be-unconfined just to put
in an oar on my own account i will simply
say that all your crew of husky toughs
assisted by their adorable mistress cant
scare me one little bit let em all come
the more the jollier theyre a bunch of
amusing fakes as pirates-

   insolent fool i will gladly shoot you
with my own hand the first sight i get of
you after this night  she cried she turned
to the door and flung back at him  that
is the last word i go to give orders that
you are to be shot on sight 

   go to it sweet miriam he taunted
 you must be thick if you dont know by
this time that jim gurney is proof against
all you can do no joking lady it cant
be done i carry a charm that turns bullets
into plumbago

  his smile maddened her beyond limit
she snatched her pistol from her bosom and
the cold round muzzle was presented
straight at jims head

   then let me see your charm work 

  she pressed the trigger slowly until the
hammer rose a fraction of an inch and her
blazing eyes seemed to shoot forth red-gold
fires the taunting smile never left his
face and his clear keen eyes met the fires
in her own with glint of steel she let the
hammer down again and repeated the
action like a beautiful demon of exquisite
suspense

   go ahead-shoot he smiled

   stubborn fool must i destroy another
crab before you believe my bullets fly true
see i press the trigger a little more then
what of your charm

  if she sought to uncover the raw nerves
of him she revealed inhuman skill in her
methods but now she faced a man such
as had never crossed her path hitherto a
man in whom nature had planted unfertile
seeds of fear that had never fructified
gurney had faced out many a bluff before
-bluffs perhaps not as perilous as this but
still bluffs-and he had acquired a clever
gamblers instinct for detecting them he
watched the slow governed rise and fall of
the clean-up



her pistol-hammer curiously and refused to
throw down his cards

   why dont you shoot he asked coolly
 try the power of my charm im sure
youd be highly interested

  their eyes held each other while per-
haps three tinkling waves splashed like tiny
silver bells on the dark beach outside then
the woman lowered her weapon a tumult-
uous sigh that was almost a sob burst from
her breast and her face softened for an
instant she seemed to grow old and the fire
of her gaze was quenched in a mist of
yearning then her self-possession returned
her scarlet lips curved full and smiling and
she offered her hand

   we should not be foes jim she whis-
pered  such a man is not fit food for
sniping bullets let us declare a truce a
while think over my request you are
my man-my man by every law of nature
and i need you jim doubly now i need
you think over this in the solitude of
your couch and when you seek me to tell
me you have decided you will find my
mountain paths open to you

  she left him impetuously as if not daring
to remain longer in his presence and his
reply was called after her dim vanishing
form as she entered the bush

  you declared war you proclaimed the
truce neither is of my suggestion so dont
bank on what i shall do im a free-lance
in all things he called his message out
with laughter in his voice she gave no
sign that she heard and he filled and lighted
his pipe chuckling with glee at his victory

  the encounter left him far too wakeful
for sleep the moment he succeeded in dis-
missing miriam jobert temporarily from his
mind the vision of barbara flashed back to
him and his chuckling mood was chastened
he pondered over various reasons which
might have induced the girl to visit him at
that late hour but none satisfied him in
their intercourse since his arrival he and
the girl had not felt the need of respecting
conventions and goff himself had been the
first to assure him that such things were
idiotic burdens to ultracivilized life and not
at all called for on tarani

  their comradeship had been free and
frank he had gladly made a chum of the

girl who showed astounding capacity in
every sort of outdoor pursuit and who
treated him as she might have treated a
big brother who had grown up with her
reciprocating he treated her much like a
sister a tomboyish sister perhaps he
thought but the sort who appealed to him
by reason of her very tomboyish unaffected-
ness only since she had discovered the
desirability of personal adornment had she
changed and that he put down to a natural
vanity that perhaps had been awakened by
the chance discovery of some long-hidden
store of feminine fripperies

  he remembered that when occasion de-
manded she had no scruples in casting
aside her finery and resuming the much
more suitable attire in which he had first
seen her now while he vividly recalled
her standing in his doorway disheveled
and panting anger blazing in her pretty
face he blindly refused to see what miriam
jobert had seen in a flash

  miriam joberts mature loveliness was
self-evident such women had often come
into gurneys lurid life and it required no
very keen perception for such a man to ap-
praise such a woman-least of all to weigh
up and number her physical attractions as
they appealed to his own physical self but
such women as barbara goff were not likely
to be found in the coverts he had hunted in
and he failed utterly to recognize in the
sweet wholesome product of gods out-
doors backed by the subtle influence of
inherited culture a budding woman of
physical charm outmatching in its subtlety
the flamboyant attractions of the older wo-
man and a sweet desirability as widely dif-
ferent from the seductiveness of miriam as
a nectarine differs from an apple of sodom

   poor child she must have come to show
me some new ribbon or something was the
decision he arrived at and he felt sorry in
the same way as he would feel sorry had
he broken an infants doll

  his pipe was smoked out and he filled
it again undecided whether to walk along
shore to goffs place or not he wanted to
make his peace with barbara for he be-
lieved the girl must have gone to bed in
tears he tried to detect a light in the
traders house which would give him an


all-story weekly

excuse for paying such a belated call but
the house was dark and still he stopped
irresolutely persuaded that it might do as
well in the morning and while convincing
himself that this course was best he heard
the crunching of sand down by the rocks
and in a few minutes he received his third
visitor of that busy evening

   oh hello goff i was just deciding
whether to come down to your place or
not he cried in welcome when the trader
stepped out of the darkness into the circle
of lamplight  this has been a busy night
anything the matter

  goff wore a look of perplexity strange to
him his habitual expression of bored in-
difference was still visible but as a face
seen through a transparent mask-the new
expression partially covered without obscur-
ing it he leaned against a veranda post
and looked steadily at gurney for some
time without speaking merely acknowledg-
ing the greeting with a curt nod he held
under his arm a book but seemed to be
unaware of the fact his shoes and the but-
tom of his trouser-legs were soaked with
water and a trickle of salt had dried on one
cheek

  altogether gurney sensed that nothing
less than a tremendous crisis in his affairs
could have happened to shake the trader
out of his detached placidity he waited
patiently for goff to speak pushing forward
a stool and placing tobacco and knife handy
for his guest when at length the trader
opened his lips he touched on the very
subject that had given gurney cause for
reflection a moment before

   i think there is nothing the matter
worth while making a fuss over he said
 but perhaps i may want to leave tarani
for a while something seems to be giving
my girl considerable fits gurney and im
afraid its the everlasting solitude here i
had lost all sense of solitude myself and
forgot that a child does not see things
through adult eyes

  fits gasped gurney taking the
traders vernacular literally

  oh not convulsions goff replied ir-
ritably  thats a figure of speech per-
haps i mean shes cutting up capers lately
and acting like a peevish child i cant im-

agine whats the cause of it unless as i
have said the solitude is beginning to over-
balance the fun she had contrived to get
out of the sea and the open

   i thought she seemed peevish re-
marked gurney wisely  she was here to-
night just for a moment but she didnt
speak a word and cut back home like a
scared rabbit

   yes thats why i came here to see you
about it thought perhaps she was angry
with you for some childish reason she ran
up to the house dived in through the screen
and in a few seconds i saw this come flying
out and she was crying out all the angry
little words that serve children for swear-
words

  he placed the book on the table and
gurney saw that it was saturated with
water but there was no mistaking the
book it was barbaras treasured volume of
 the round table

   i got the book out of the sea con-
tinued goff  cant permit things like
books to go adrift in a place like this you
know far too scarce but while i was
wading into the sea to rescue arthurs
 knights barbara flew past me along the
beach and put to sea in her canoe

   no doubt she tired of such tales after
years of them too much quail is a poor
diet i really think i must take her away
for a trip and let her see things she will
come back freshened by the change and
glad to return to the very solitude that is
irritating her now

   it might be a good notion agreed
jim feeling sorrowful at the prospect of
losing his chum but thinking that perhaps
the child did need the change

   im glad you agree you see im the
only regular white resident here and as
such i am in much the same position with
the authorities as an official resident though
the parallel is a joke and nobody ever
bothers me as such but as trader i have
certain duties and there is my stock to
keep replenished when the yearly ship
comes that will be here in a few months
now so i want to ask you how you feel
about assuming charge of my place while
we are away

  goff appeared doubtful as he put the
the clean-up



suggestion as if fearing he asked too much
of a casual friend but gurney saw only
a fine opportunity to do a good turn for his
girl-chum in making it easy for her father
to take her away and he replied with a
cheery grin

  	 glad to goff anything- on earth i
can do is at your call i owe you more
than that for your favors to me

   not at all not at all dissented the
trader hastily  i have done nothing for
you that calls for any return but i am
obliged to you for your ready offer come
along to-morrow morning and we will all
talk the matter over ill keep barbara at
home until you come by the way come
for breakfast then she will surely be home
thanks ever so much good night

  the trader left as suddenly as he had
come and gurney watched him until he
was out of sight then he scanned the
vague dusky sea for sign of the canoe but
barbara had sought the open bosom of old
ocean with her troubles and her tiny sail
was not visible he filled another pipe with
shredded plug less than ever disposed to
sleep and while he puffed his eyes fell upon
the water-soaked book on his table forgot-
ten apparently by goff

  he picked it up with a whimsical smile
idly opening the damp pages and carefully
freeing some that were adhering the crude
wood-cuts forced a chuckle from him but
his chief thought was that here was a
treasure belonging to his friend a treasure
flung out certainly in a fit of pique but a
treasure nevertheless and as such not to be
lightly disposed of

    ill dry it out and keep it for her he
thought and cut a stick to run along the
back binding so that the volume might be
hung up in the sunlight in the morning
but still his thoughts persisted in following
barbara in a train which did nothing to
help solve the problem of her sudden
vagaries

   sure she got tired of this junk a
steady diet of lords and ladies and hali-
doms aint very nourishing for a growing
girl father ought to get her some real
girls books like  aunt janes hero or
 poor prim the crippled canary ill
give him a hint when i see him

   so thinking he decided to woo sleep and
before getting into his hammock took a
last look around from point to point
his vision searched the sea then from point
to point along shore taking in mountain
and forest salt brush and highland crag
and his gaze lingered longer than elsewhere
upon the heights which sheltered miriam
jobert

into the mountains

f y that dye think of a girl like
yy that complainingly demanded
goff at breakfast next morning
gurney sat opposite barbara puzzled at
her expression he had answered the trad-
ers invitation to breakfast in a state of
trepidation for he knew that in her fathers
presence he could scarcely ridicule the girl
out of a petulant mood by his usual
methods

  goff took things far too seriously for
that perhaps he did not make a really
heavy burden of life but his sense of
humor was buried under many layers of
toughened epidermis and his remark of the
night before about taking barbara away
proved his inability to dismiss the girls
sudden change in behavior lightly now his
demand for an opinion caught gurney at a
moment when he was himself puzzled out
of all belief

  barbara had a moment before retorted
to her fathers suggestion of a trip to civ-
ilization by furiously declining to quit the
island under any circumstances whatever
until the instant of her hot refusal she had
behaved toward gurney with very precise
obviously studied politeness her eyes met
his coldly almost disdainfully and her
pretty face was colorless except for shad-
owy rings of dusky trouble about her eyes
she spoke to him when she had to in level
painfully proper tones his first bantering
attempt to rouse her had been met by such
magnificent superiority of aspect that even
jim gurney was silenced

  but now with her fathers demand yet
audible flames leaped from her eyes and
the rich blood mantled her face and throat

she sprang from the table panting and fled
to her tiny sanctuary on the veranda gur-
ney and the trader stared after her then at
each other and gurney felt compelled to
give an answer

   she beats me sir he said  i thought
she would jump at the chance to go away
for a while perhaps this is only another
phase of the trouble if trouble there is and
when she has had a chance to think it over
quietly she may gladly consent to go you
may count on me if you want me to look
after -things let me know im going to
take a ramble over the island to-day and
may be gone a couple of days but i guess
you can always find me hey

   oh if i wanted to send a native after
you no doubt i could bribe one to visit that
mountain by giving him my house and
store and giving him a mortgage on my
immortal soul gurney but i dont think
ill do that ill wait until you come back
by the way -there was no alteration in
the cool indifferent tone- my girl told
me you had a narrow squeak a little while
back those people up there are best left
alone old chap you can find good sport
in far less smelly places than among those
crags

   thanks ill look out grinned jim
 i never let a man roll me over without
getting even with him though when those
brigands took so much trouble over me
they stirred up my inquisitiveness more than
they imagined i want to see why now
have you got a spare gun i lost mine on
the cliff

   there is a box of pistols somewhere in
the store and some ammunition too take
what you fancy but take my advice too
dont meddle with those chaps its bad
enough to have them near without stirring
them up

  there was a faint sound at barbaras
screen and the quick ear of gurney de-
tected distress in it he sought the tra-
ders eyes but that bored man was already
moving toward the storeroom apparently
oblivious to the sound jims impulsive
heart went out to the troubled girl yet
he could not understand her malady and
therefore hesitated to apply a remedy

  he wanted to talk to her to perhaps

snatch her up and make her chase him
through the surf but her breakfast-time
mood frightened him and he could not at-
tempt it he thought however of a means
whereby he could tel her he was not in-
different to her troubles and as he stepped
after goff he called out aloud

   have you got a lantern too id like
to carry one along with me if youve got
one of those small hurricane lamps then
you need not worry about me ill flash
you the alls well at dark every night
from some point on the crest-if i am kept
away more than a day or so

  the suggestion was for barbaras benefit
and though jim gurney knew nothing of
it then his thoughtfulness brought rich re-
sults the girl drew away from the screen
her agitation gone and sat down on her
couch muttering intensely

    care nothing for you and your lamp
red-headed clod i care nothing-noth-
ing but the words were given the lie
by the glow of her darkened softened eyes
even her father impression-proof though
he was might have suspected her reason for
refusing to leave tarani had he seen her
face in that moment

  but neither he nor gurney saw it and
manlike the moment the traders store was
opened before them they forgot the girl and
her little childish troubles gurney rum-
maged through the cases for what he
needed and the trader stood idly by as if
permitting a man to go through his stock
on trust was his sole aim in life not once
since his arrival had gurney been refused
anything the store afforded yet he had told
goff that there was small likelihood of his
ever being able to pay

  but it seemed to make no difference and
now with a very useful revolver in his
hand and a case of cartridges open at his
feet the wonder of it struck him afresh
he had wondered before but had been
satisfied with the traders explanation that
he might more than pay for the stores he
took by services rendered reciprocally

   theres your lantern too goff
drawled pointing to a hook  i think its
filled with kerosene that size will burn for
about six hours on end anything else
you want
the clean-up



   yes replied gurney lifting down the
lantern  i want to ask you something
im scooping things out of your store and
youre getting nothing for it if youre
keeping tally its all right-i shall surely
settle some day but theres not a chance
that i can see of you getting anything
back for yourgoods while i remain here
youre not forgetting that are you

   my dear chap dont talk bally rot
protested goff lazily  i never saw such a
fellow for hunting trouble surely i may
do as i will with my own i shall be re-
paid satisfactorily  have no doubt why
dont you leave it for the merchant to com-
plain never in my life have i known a
customer kick because he wasnt dunned
jim took his purchases home in thought-
ful mood every turn he made lately he
seemed to encounter white men who per-
sisted in seeing something desirable in him
he frankly could not understand it but
the fact started a warm spot glowing at
his breast he more than ever determined
to justify his strangely acquired friends
estimate of his worth by making such a
thorough job of his clean-up that even the
germs of dirt should be destroyed utterly

  before leaving his shack on his journey
he conned over in his mind those written
instructions he had committed to memory
before destroying them and the truth im-
pressed him that he had been on tarani for
weeks now and had really accomplished
nothing he had not even found the actual
community he came to rout out although
its denizens had forced themselves harshly
upon his notice and apart from a brief
sjght of a single vessel leaving the secluded
harbor he had seen nothing to give him a
hint of the activities that had aroused the
attention of powerful interests

  the more he considered it the sterner
his resolve became to cut out all subterfuge
and go direct to his object miriam joberts
announcement that he should be unmolested
he dismissed with a shrug and started off
up the track muttering

   thats up to her i have given her
no promise to consider her proposition she
can do as she likes its the business and
business only for mine

  there was a freshness in the air that ren-

  dered the high sun pleasant yet it carried
a dampness too and the trees and whisper-
ing surf gave forth a note like the sighing
that precedes a change of weather once
within the dark jungle the coolness was
routed by the hot mugginess of steaming
verdure and a hundred yards of upland
toiling through it persuaded jim that easier
going might be found in the open

  he struck off to the westward toward the
point where he understood the native set-
tlement lay he had not yet visited that
region and knew nothing of the layout of
the land but as he proceeded he found
while no plain path existed the bush was
less dense and the slope less steep

  the spur of the central cone of the island
dwindled away to a gentle declivity on
which the trees took on a different aspect
changing from mountain timber to longer-
stemmed more unbrageous subtropical
growths and he came across a little singing
stream that swirled merrily downward
toward the sea beyond the islands further
point

  here he flung himself down and un-
packed his lunch thrilled with the contrast-
ing vista of wild grandeur speared by the
silver shaft of the pretty brook his back
rested against a mossy old boulder his feet
overhung the stream above him crooned the
wind in the cheeping fronds of a palmetto
and his appetite was a thing of joy in tune
with his surroundings

  into his hungry solitude crashed swift
alarms and his teeth remained parted in the
act of crunching into a biscuit the rock
behind him clanged sharply something
brushed his shoulder and a short iron-tipped
arrow fell across his legs he remained
still not even moving his hands down but
eyes and ears were busy his eyes failed
to discover but his ears detected a very
faint rustle of brush different from the rustle
of the breeze and it came across the stream

action replaced outward indifference
with a bound he gathered his feet under
him took a flying leap and landed on the
other side of the water plunged into the
thicket and caught a whisk of brown dart-
ing deeper into cover in a dozen long
strides he overtook his quarry and gathered
to his bosom as he flung himself forward


all-story weekly

a palpitating little brown man whose eyes
blinked up into his with animal-like sub-
mission and fear

   here what fashion he demanded
turning the man over and shaking him
savagely  what for you skewer me
hey

  the native lay still except for his trem-
bling and made no answer gurney peered
hard into the mans face seeking for a mo-
tive for murder other than savagery in
that small brown visage lurked no such
bloodthirstiness as should urge to murder
it was rather the face of a martyr in the
presence of unmerited death willing to
suffer

   you poor little devil breathed jim
leaning back and regarding the man less
ferociously  ill bet you didnt take a
shot at me for nothing whats the fuss
hey

  there was no answer the man lay
dumb waiting for his punishment and
gurney rapidly decided what to do with
him picking him up bodily he carried him
back to the big rock and set him down
beside his interrupted lunch the fear in
the little mans eyes intensified then grew
into stark wonder when his captor put bis-
cuit and meat into his hands

  like a wild beast newly taken he refused
to eat but his appearance belied the ab-
sence of hunger gumey went on with his
own meal appearing not to notice his pris-
oner but all the time he plied him with
questions between bites seeking to draw the
reason for the attack he tried every tack
fruitlessly until a chance remark of his
brought open doubt and faltering belief
into the brown eyes

   johnny  think maybe you think me
one man all same bad fellow up topside
hey that is wrong i look for catch those
men you tell me

  perhaps the failure of reprisal acted as
potently as his words whatever the agent
the brown man gradually lost most of his
fear he ceased to quiver and once he raised
the food almost to his mouth and every
second his soft brown eyes were fastened
in fascination on the white man

  gurney persevered in his method appar-
ently leaving the man unwatched talking

  soothingly the while eating his lunch with-
out interruption and presently he noticed
the native eating ravenously and waited
then the few minutes he believed would
bring a reply to his questions

   you no lie whispered the little brown
man at length

  	no lie sonny  look for catch those
bad fellows now tell me why you shot
at me i wont hurt you

   i think you one of those men i wait
many days to find one alone

   i thought so nodded jim and he
bent an irresistible grin of reassurance upon
his captive  well youre my friend if
thats so now tell me why you want to
shoot those fellows maybe i help you
some time

   they very bad very bad the na-
tive shook his head from side to side dole-
fully but there lurked a hard gleam in his
brown eyes  all time they steal our men
take them away far far in boats and make
dive deep for pearl plenty shark not
many men come back

   and all time they steal our women
take them up to mountain and beat them
and fetch more only old old women left
in our village now and young womans too
much frightened for wifes they steal our
food and break up our canoes and beat us
with sticks-see

  the man sprang up flashed around and
showed gurney a back scored and corru-
gated from neck to thighs with livid welts

chapter xx

the revel	

when jim resumed his journey he
was hard put to keep in sight
of the flitting brown figure that
sped before him showing him a hidden
and hazardous goat trail over a shoulder of
the mountain which seemed to have been
devastated by eruption long ago there
was no vegetation there no moisture no
moss but that very fact made for security
for neither were there any signs of human
traffic nor any visible inducement for such
to intrude there

and ever before his eyes was the cruelly
the clean-up



scored back and loins of the brown man
fuel to the flame of his anger at the brutes
who called miriam jobert mistress he
could only thank his lucky star that per-
haps the natives very thirst for vengeance
which had induced that sly shot at him had
of itself rendered his aim shaky and inaccu-
rate he could not find it in his heart to
blame the man for trying even though he
himself had come near paying anothers
debt

  he soon found himself puffing painfully
from the pace set and watched longingly
for the turn in the trail that should reveal
his journeys end all around him lay arid
volcanic debris so old that its character was
almost lost in the excoriations maae by per-
haps centuries of elemental erosion

  the high sun blazed down upon heat-
absorbing pumice and heat-reflecting rock
rendering the going like traveling through a
crematorium underfoot and overheard ad
all about him intense heat waves scorched
his perspiring body the imperceptible dust
made its presence felt at his chest after a
mile of scuffling travel

  still the little brown man ahead showed
no fatigue no discomfort flitting from point
to point like a chamois gurney began to
cast longing glances backward where the
hazy blue of the sea looked so cool and
refreshing to his seared vision he was on
the point of calling a halt for rest

  then in a moment the outlook changed
his guide suddenly stood out in sharp sil-
houette against the sky waved back eagerly
and vanished in a little puff of dust jim
ran forward expectant of disaster and
caught his breath sharply at the vivid con-
trast in the scene rising to the crest pre-
pared to look down upon a wall cliff and
perhaps a crushed brown body far below
he found the native squatting comfortably
on a small green ledge of grass almost en-
tirely concealed by a clump of bushes that
blazed with floral color like a rich jewel
in a heap of dross

  by hickey youve got a fine nose
he cried jumping down beside his guide
the native laid a finger to his lips and
clucked warningly pulling some branches
aside in front of him and pointing through
gurney leaned forward and peered out of

the leafy window and slowly his old-time
grin stole over his hot face and stayed
there

  its the box-seat of the show he
chuckled and softly patted the brown
shoulder beside him

  here was a new outlook indeed and one
which could hardly be improved on where
he crouched the mountain top seemed to
be carved in the shape of a great armchair
upholstered with mossy velvet and short
green grasses at his back the volcanic rock
stood black as time-weathered oak in
front the ledge the seat of the chair rolled
over in a gentle curve to continue down
a hundred feet through more stunted moun-
tain timber

  but farther down twinkling like a silver
shield in the sun-rays lay the panorama of
the harbor which he had such excellent rea-
son to remember from his height the ex-
panse of sheltered sea was sharply defined
in every detail of forbidding entrance and
treacherous submerged reef the s-shaped
barrier that made the place inaccessible to
strangers could be traced as clearly as if
drawn in dark paint on silver paper and
a small schooner at that moment threading
the passage gave an object lesson too use-
ful to be ignored in solving intricacies

  studying the schooners course with every
faculty alert gurney forgot everything else
for the moment he noticed nothing save
that one small ship until she let go her an-
chor snugly embayed under the cliff in
deep water easily estimated by the amount
of chain paid out then raising his eyes
another vessel hove in sight another and
another all stout sloops and in line they
sailed the serpentine channel to come to
anchor with the schooner

   her ladyships fleet jim grinned and
now had leisure to examine further

  nestling in a lovely recess in the great
cliffside surrounded by gorgeous foliage
shaded by both trees and rock carpeted
by vivid green as level as a built floor lay
a cluster of huts and it was not difficult
for gurney to realize that from almost any
view-point except his lucky one the settle-
ment was entirely concealed

  behind the foremost habitations sur-
rounded by palms and colorful bushes

stood a more imposing structure and its
immediate surroundings gave evidence of
scrupulous and industrious attention at hu-
man hands sand of dazzling whiteness lay
flat and evenly traced in paths that wound
prettily through the vivid green of the
grass in circles and crescents masses of
flowers splashed the green and silver with
color their scent came even up to the
mountain crest in faint sensuous incense

  jim was aware that the natives face had
come close to his own and he smiled up
into two brown eyes full of inquiry the
unspoken question undoubtedly was re-
garding his next move and there was also
a trace of reviving suspicion the natives
cruel experiences at the hands of those peo-
ple down there were much too fresh in his
mind to permit so sudden an acceptance of
gurneys real status and now that the end
was attained and the white mans animated
face indicated his intense satisfaction the
little brown man harbored doubts if after
all he had not served the enemy jim
hastened to reassure him

  whats your name johnny he
smiled pressing the mans arm softly

   mgwai was the response  those
mans call me useless when i dive for
pearl

   h-m-a poor choice-but suppose 
call you useful hey it suits you better
than their name and ill make a bad mess
of it if i try to say your real tally all
right then useful it is

   well useful youre a good scout and
im going to show you very soon that those
bad fellows down there wont bother your
people much longer youre my good
friend useful and i want you to do as i
tell you now you run along home and
tell your folks to keep away from here for
a while you can come back if you want
to and maybe i can use you if you come
to this place keep out of sight and i shall
come up to find you hows that

  while he was speaking jim opened his
pack and laid out food again for the hours
had sped since lunch he shared his din-
ner with useful then considered a while
and wrapped up the remainder and handed
it to the native saying

   take it along with you ill get plenty

more and if you come up to-morrow ill
give you enough to take home to your
family

  useful took the food with wolfish eyes
and the last trace of doubt vanished from
his face

   i come back when die sun go in the
water he said and turned and vanished
over the crest like a streak

  jims reckless disposal of his food supply
was not quite the piece of foolhardiness it
seemed for he had come to a definite de-
cision while gazing down at the stronghold
of the magnificent miriam the moment
those vessels swung back on their ground-
tackle securely moored boats had left their
weathered sides and their jubilant shouts
left small room for doubt that the fore-
gathering was to be properly celebrated

  now that useful had gone jim took
closer notice of the intervening ground be-
tween himself and the settlement and
waited longer in the expectation of seeing
the woman appear but miriam either was
taking an afternoon nap threatened by the
arriving disturbance or away from home
and his binoculars failed to tell him which
his judgment however persuaded him to
the latter belief since he could not visualize
such a woman calmly suffering her repose
to be broken by the uncouth noises rising
from her shaggy rascals

  he closely inspected every yard of the
visible cliff to find the answer to his ques-
tion but no woman came into the field of
his glasses and at length with the sun yet
two hours high he stretched himself luxu-
riously on the moss and watched die doings
of the landing sailors beneath him

  there were roaring greetings and bois-
terous hailing of cronies in other vessels in-
dicating that all these men seldom met to-
gether little knots gathered on the beach
and from time to time gurney caught sight
of fitting brown figures frantically busy
among the huts as if in deadly fear of the
sailors they were undoubtedly the women
whom useful spoke of as being forced to
serve the sea-jackals but in the first flush
of their landing the vessels crews were full
of raucous jollity that had not yet turned
to drunken cruelty and more than once a
shivering little brown woman was snatched
the clean-up



from her feet into the arms of a burly ruf-
fian and fiercely kissed

  presently a movement among the gangs
resolved itself into semblance of order and
all hands trooped a little way along the
beach to a hut from which the walls had
been removed and in which were set tables
laden with food and liquor the feast van-
ished so swiftly before the onslaught of rav-
enous teeth that the uproar of voices scarce-
ly paused before it was renewed and re-
doubled in the pleasanter bout with the
plentiful bottles

  tables were soon littered with food
scraps and empties the scraps were flung
roughly to the serving native girls the emp-
ties as often as not were flung at them
and uproarious mirth took on a deeper note
as the orgy proceeded and the light began
to fade into sunset and still the bottles
went the rounds

  gurney watched the scene with reminis-
sent eyes for many were the similar bouts
in which he had engaged memory- stirred
more keenly when a hulking great negro
sprang up overturning the table as he rose
and continued on his course until every
table in the place was sent crashing out
then a deep bellowing voice boomed out
calling for a dance and the demand came
up to gurney mellowed by the distance
into a tuneful roar

  jim now sought once more for traces of
the woman but saw none he shrewdly
surmised that were she down below there
would be less unruly behavior among her
men yet there was no sign of human being
on the face of the cliff and he commanded
a view of wide scope he saw the crews
hang lanterns to the rafters of the hut and
heard preliminary protests of a murdered
fiddle and the bright yellowness of the lan-
tern lights warned him that sunlight was
done for the day it reminded him of use-
ful and he waited to see if the native came
back for he had resolved to pay a visit to
that dance and preferred not to risk having
useful lose control over his nerves and take
pot shots at his foes in the dark

  true to his promise the little brown man
appeared like a shadow at jims elbow a
few moments after the blood-red sun had
dipped in another hemispheres rosy dawn

and the soft brown eyes hardened sharply
at the sounds and sights below sights were
limited to black shapes passing across yel-
low shafts of lamplight but sounds were
more generous in their revelations hoarse
laughter and gruff oaths mingled with
sharp frightened little cries of women and
at times a shriek was smothered before it
was fully born the native was in a frenzy
of uneasiness and jim hurried to get him
away

   here useful i have a job for you
he smiled and unpacked his hurricane lan-
tern  i have good friends other side and
they look for my lamp at this time see
you take him to the mountain top where
you can see traders house savvee sit
down there one hour two hours and make
flash all same this

  he lit the lantern and showed the na-
tive how to work the slide to make a suc-
cession of flashes the novelty impressed
useful and he departed willingly the more
so when jim told him he was going down
to stop those womens cries

  you come back here and wait for me
hey concluded jim -  sit tight here and
ill come back to you and dont try
shooting arrows down there son or else i
wont be your friend any more-see

  useful disappeared into the darkness
and gurney waited until he was sure the
man had gone then with a cheerful tune
whistling through his teeth he crawled
over the ledge and walked clawed and
slithered down the slope toward the settle-
ment

  making no effort at concealment he
reached the more accessible paths in a
shower of falling rock fragments but the
racket in the dance-room was now too
strong to permit a few stones falling to
make an impression on it and he proceed-
ed whistling on his way until he passed
into the glare of the lights there were no
stragglers about the place every man ca-
pable of shaking a leg was shaking two to
the racking screech of a tortured fiddle in
the paws of a drunken fiddler on board
the anchored vessels no lights were shown
even the after decks were black unshot by
a single gleam of companionway radiance
or skylight glow

  gurney did not stop to hitch his belt
button his jacket pat his pistols or do any
of the other queer tricks that fiction heroes
are supposed to perform before walking into
a crisis he walked straight ahead exactly
like jim gurney would sauntered into the
glaring entrance to the dance-hall and
stood against the post still whistling his
eyes twinkling and his freckled face pre-
senting a care-free grin to the crowd

  the lurching fiddler spotted him first
and the music stopped as if suddenly cut
off over the chinned fiddle a ragged
loose mouth hung open above it two bleary
eyes stuck out like knobs

dangerous partners

the cessation of the music went un-
noticed for perhaps a brace of breaths
simply because the dancers in the
heat of their ardor hung amorously over
their small partners breathing whisky
fumes and lurid love into frightened ears
the trembling native women for the great-
er part swung off their feet in the rough
embraces of their clumsy gallants saw
nothing except the hated bodies to which
they were clutched only when the fiddlers
expression was accentuated by a curse did
a man look up and in a second the place
was blanketed in silence to change as
swiftly into uproar

  gurney looked on in keen amusement
fearing no man he regarded the enti-
scene critically mentally comparing it witn
others in which he had played a part he
recognized his old acquaintance joe and
looked for the others whom he had met
and everywhere he looked he saw ferocity
glaring at him a mutteringgrowl hoarse
and menacing filled the room and the
dancing partners separated the women
scurrying to the corners in affright as they
were flung aside

  j im grinned cheerfully back at the lower-
ing crowd and maintained his position
against the door-post he caught growling
sentences queries and retorts in half-
doubtful undertones and the mens regard
seemed to be divided between himself and

some point out of his immediate vicinity
soon came louder voices and a fiercer note
crept into them

   shell give us scorching hell grumbled
one and another snarled back  let her
scorch shes up top wont be down for
an hour yet the debate was ended when
anothertough specimen added shell stay
on the lookout as longs that steamer keeps
her lights in sight anyway and it takes a
long-time to sink a light from the top o
this cone dump th red-headed bobcat
over the rocks 

  there was little uncertainty about the
rush that followed the gang came crouch-
ing with hands crooked like cargo-hooks
ready to tear the presumptuous intruder
who seemed to be there for the sole pur-
pose of mocking at them for previous fail-
ures and those failures were communi-
cated by the parties to them in curseful
words to the men lately arrived the time
elapsing in that rush from the mid-floor to
gurneys position was measured in swift
seconds perhaps the longer on account of
the identity of the leaders those were
men who had handled the red-headed one
before and joe was careful to be behind
center-rush of the wedge

  they were maddened by the glinting
gray eyes and care-free grin beneath that
crest of flaming hair maddened further by
the absolute indifference to their fury
shown in gurneys cool attitude his back
was against the post his-iiands behind him
and thus he stood until the swarm was
within five feet of him then he moved
but the rage-reddened eyes confronting him
failed to detect what he had been quietly
preparing for them

  jims keen perception had early revealed
to him the structure of the hut it was sim-
ilar to his own except in size roof walls
flooring all were removable in sections and
the walls had already been taken down to
give free air to the dancers the posts of
corners and doors simply fitted into sockets
and when he first took his stand against his
particular timber his hands tested its solid-
ity now as he leaped back he tore up
the post a stout piece of timber four square
and seven feet long and his cheery smile
changed to a contemptuous laugh
the clean-up



  the gang came on murderous and half-
blind with fury and the foremost found
himself suddenly sitting back in the midst
of his mates clutching his breastbone in
gasping agony he had met jims post
end on and had been hurled back like a
ball from a billiard cue

   come on spot him again  grinned the
red-headed billiardist and mocked them
with his pointed post

  his challenge was taken up with a roar
and he was forced to give ground to find
room for his next shot grinning ever
cheerful he made two shots with his big
cue in rapid order and two human billiard
balls caromed off their fellows to fall breath-
less to the floor

  up to that moment no weapon had been
flashed but leaders became scarce after the
second visitation of that awful post used
in a manner never before imagined by any
of the bestial crowd the next man who
rushed upon jim came tugging at his knife
the post went to meet him taking him
squarely in the stomach before his knife
could flash the steel clattered on the
boards and the man crashed down beside
it eyes that had blazed murder at jim
began to smolder in cowardly fear

   come on bullies pleaded gurney
temptingly lowering the end of his post
 dont spoil a good scrap by funking
here this is the sport

  with the cry he leveled his weapon
again stamped his foot twice on the floor
and charged the mob like a flaming streak
jabbing and thrusting with his unwieldy
spear in approved bayonet fighting fashion
the crowd tumbled backward in swearing
haste and he rested in the middle of the
hut regarding the scene humorously

   well well he grinned  such fine
fellows to be wicked pirates your dancing
was rotten your fiddling was punk your
deportment toward your partners was aw-
ful but for really truly stock-yards smelli-
ness your scrapping ability scoops the pot

   dye mean to tell me youre quitting
after starting out to dump me over the
rocks dont be so unkind here give a
fellow a run for his white-alley wont
you and he flung the post clattering to
the floor behind him

  he was aware that some unseen influ-
ence was at work-unseen that is by him
unseen too no doubt by the crowd as a
whole yet some of the men were surely
subject to it and it was not many seconds
before all were wise when he cast his
fearsome weapon from him he stood lightly
poised on the balls of his feet hands loosely
closed beside him ready to drive in a punch
or to grapple and he hoped somebody
would take up his gauntlet for the old
fighting blood in him was bubbling to a
boil and of the feast he promised himself
he had swallowed only the appetizer

  but his challenge was accepted in a man-
ner not to his idea of sportsmanship at
the back of the halting gang a one-eyed
ruffian shoved his ugly face between the
shoulders of two of his mates and jim
spotted a gun-barrel dropping to his level
in front of that single red-shot eye the
cheery grin vanished anger sat in its place
and he leaped back and stooped to pick up
his post again to make a punishing on-
slaught upon the treacherous gang

  as he bent down the place was filled with
the roar of a shot and of a sudden all other
noises were hushed queerly thought jim
the shot was accompanied by no smoke or
flash but his sharp eyes speedily took in
the picture in its reality no bullet had
come near him that he felt s but the
report had scarcely terminated vhen the
one-eyed mans single eye glazed in terror
his gun fell unfired and the crowd split
aside from him leaving him a specimen of
whimpering cowardice holding a shattered
hand that dripped red

  on every face sat confusion and fear
every eye was fixed upon a point behind
gurney and he swung around to see for
himself and his gaze lighted upon the
figure of miriam jobert splendid in her
anger her beautiful face ablaze and her
eyes seeking among the crowd as if for an-
other mark for the pistol in her hand

  her aspect softened when her eyes met
gurneys and she swept majestically into
the hut while her rascals cowered in the
wings and watched her with faces full of
apprehension

  recalling what he knew of her gurney
waited for the explosion of imperial wrath


 all-story weekly

he felt surely must follow and all of her
unruly crew apparently anticipated nothing
less jims chief curiosity was as to just
how such a woman ruled such a gang and
nothing in his experience of women gave
him a hint of the actual truth which was
swiftly to be shown

  miriam advanced to the cowering mob
and after she had smiled reassuring at gur-
ney her face was set in an emotionless mask
that gave a shivery impression the man
she had winged stood sullenly where she
had shot him the red dripping monotonous-
ly on the boards his mates herded apart
very unlike the bold brutes of ten minutes
before and until she stood within touch
of the one-eyed ruffian miriam spoke no
word gave no sigh but the moment she
could reach him her slim hand flashed out
and left the imprints of her fingers across
his swarthy face

  gurney grinned -gleefully wondering if
by such methods that crowd could ever be
brought to subjection by a woman he
was quickly undeceived and the smile
faded from his face the woman now
spoke in a tone so soft so utterly calm
that the words seemed a horrid jest

   take this beast away tie him well
with green withes and leave him on the
ledge at the fxt of the cliff away with
him 

   don do that lady let him fight me
with his hands ill punish him protested
jim feeling guilty when he heard the same
fate meted out to this man as he himself
had barely escaped

   peace the woman smiled at him  he
has earned this friend jim for he would
have disobeyed me and injured you she
assumed an air of geniality and stepped
alertly apart from the men crying  come
let this be enough start up the dance
again here you fiddler have you lost the
use of your fingers play play

  a short conflict took place when four
men seized their luckless comrade and car-
ried him away but it was silenced and for-
gotten in the renewed whirl of the dance
for now every sullen face forced a grin of
enjoyment before the mistress and whether
he felt like it or not every man fell to ca-
pering madly with his girl as if striving to

outdo his fellows gurney was not kindly
disposed toward the author of the freshly
recent condemnation of a fellow man to
tortured death but he could not withhold
a meed of admiration for the perfect con-
trol miriam exercised over these uncivi-
lized brutes

  he met her gaze upon him and there
was challenge in her eyes moving with
pcrfect grace she glided toward him her
feet in rhythm with the screeching music
that had at least the merit of fair tempo
and as he caught her meaning the old adam
in him was resurrected the spell of the fa-
miliar scene seized upon him and meeting
her challenge with his irresistible grin he
sprang to meet her and in a breath they
were among the dancers swaying to the
tune their bodies touching their faces very
close

  at touch of her jim sensed a subtle in-
toxication surrounding him that rendered
him oblivious to every other human being
in the crowded hut her lips were parted
in a seductive smile her great eyes glowed
with soft red-gold fires filmed with dusky
allure and as she swayed in time with
him her corsage gave forth a perfume of
sensuous insidiousness her hair swept his
cheek the scarlet lips were open by his
neck breathing warm fragrance upon him
that stole to the roots of his soul

  never in a full life had he danced with
such a creature snatch back his thoughts
as he would everything outside the present
moment vanished from his memory at the
fourth circle of the room his eyes had dark-
ened and his breath issued hot and impetu-
ous from his lips

  and then she laughed low musical
thrilling

chapter xxlj

a visitor

while the crew of miriam danced
the steamers light which she had
been watching from the mountain
stole into sight from barbaras beach it
was not yet time for the regular schooner
to arrive and at any time a steamer was
something to gaze on with curiosity
the clean-up



  barbara sat outside the house with her
pretty eyes straining into the darkness at
the hilltop where half an hour before she
had seen the gladdening flash of the lan-
tern which told her that her lancelot was
safe that night she stared at the invisible
spot as if still hoping for yet another sig-
nal goffs cry of the steamer in sight di-
verted her attention to seaward and while
she never forgot lancelot for one moment
natural curiosity made her join her father
in a vigil of watching

   potty little tub whatever she is re-
marked the trader the dimness of the
lights and the slowness of her approach
hinted at least that much and that she was
seeking the island was apparent by the un-
wavering bearing she maintained  won-
der what on earth she wants here he
mused half to himself  i hope were not
going to have bally tourists start bothering
us barbara

   oh perhaps the steamer is taking the
schooners turn the girl replied with no
very deep interest in her voice  why
dont you go out in the canoe and meet
her dad maybe she wont want to an-
chor if you tell the captain how bad the
holding ground is here

  by jove i think i will cried goff
eagerly  that may stop nosy people per-
haps will you come barbara

   no i dont want to pm tired

  goff put to sea in the girls canoe and
the tiny sail soon disappeared in the dark-
ness leaving barbara peering at the un-
welcome green and red and white lights
steadily drawing in closer she soon wear-
ied of looking at them and turned her gaze
again on the mountain for there at least
her heart found sweet relief in the bare
thought that somewhere beyond the shad-
ows he was probably sleeping

   i know he is thinking of me she
whispered to herself  he teases me and
laughs at me but he does think of me he
must-he must 

  the thought warmed her gratefully and
it induced another thought which inten-
sified the glow in her blood he had sent
his signal as he had promised her father
but it did not say that he could not pos-
sibly return that night

   of course he made the signal to please
me she thought  that is only his kind
heart but he will come back if possible
i know he will and oh he may be here
at any time and find me like this

  this was her old garb her wildly tum-
bled hair her pretty bare feet and ankles
her wriggling unrestricted toes

   that would never do she went on as
if to the twinkling stars that leaned from
the sky in great luminous clusters of celes-
tial jewels  he would think i didnt
care and - and he always calls me kid
when pm dressed this way

  she sprang up after searching the moun-
tain blackness for hopeful signs without re-
sult and fled into her holy of holies behind
the veranda screen the light gleamed
through the screen and her shadow passed
and repassed as she hurriedly assumed her
more gorgeous attire in five minutes she
emerged breathless but happy and peered
mountainward again before going back in-
side to spend another five minutes in im-
proving the result of her hasty robing

  with delicious coquetry she placed the
lamp on the table in the main room and
turned the light up fully then seated her-
self outside but in a position where the
shaft of yellow radiance touched her and
rendered her plainly visible from a point
far along the beach she blushed when
she thought how he would discover her sit-
ting there and in anticipation she saw the
merry gray eyes of him fastened on her in
soul-gratifying admiration

  her thoughts helped nature to make her
at that moment the fairest vision eye of
man could long for if a more perfect flower
ever blossomed it was surely not on earth
nowhere outside of the seventh inner circle
of heaven could barbara be matched as she
sat there aglow eyes soft and dusky the
pure true heart of her throbbing and flut-
tering the laces at her breast she noticed
no flight of time her gaze was fixed on
the dark mountain with unwavering faith
and hope that a well-known shape would
presently detach itself from the general
shadow and come striding blithely to her

  a steamers whistle snatched her thoughts
back to the sea and she was startled to
find the canoe almost at the beach again


all-story weekly

the steamers lights had disappeared and
that circumstance gave her hope that the
intruder had decided not to remain the
whistle simply meant farewell she sur-
mised and in no fear for her fathers safety
she resumed her watch on the cliffside
knowing that soon she would hear all about
the strange ship that had come and gone
in the night

  she passed out of the immediate world
for the moment and to one approaching
the house she appeared in the lighted ve-
randa like some blessed spirit of beauty
fresh and fragrant as a dewy rose she
heard the canoe grate on the sand and then
her fathers voice her mind flitted back to
her lancelot and earthly sounds had no
meaning for her she clasped her small
brown hands about one knee and an espe-
cially happy fancy sent the warm flush
charmingly to her face again

  in that moment she was startled out of
her abstraction and brought to her feet in
flaming confusion by a mans voice near by
-a strange mans voice softly modulated
pleasant with the pleasingness of perfect
breeding

   oh i beg your pardon i was not
aware that i should find a lady here

  she looked into the face of a tall gen-
tlemanly stranger well dressed but quite
fittingly for tarani and her eyes fell be-
fore his amazed but frankly admiring gaze
in his face was the expression of one as-
tonished who was a stranger to astonish-
ment plainly he was a man not easily
shocked yet as plainly his sudden emer-
gence upon such a fair creature as barbara
in such a place came in the category of
emphatically new experiences he quickly
recovered himself however and hastened
first to help the girl out of her confusion

   mr goff sent me on up he said with
a smile  he is right behind me

  his smile was soothing and barbara re-
turned it confidently feeling somehow that
this stranger was a man to be trusted but
she told her secret self that his smile was
not so sunny as lancelots his eyes less
kindly his perfectly groomed hair of ra-
vens-wing black not nearly so beautiful as
certain other locks of blazing red she
found her fancies wandering again and

colored deeply when his low laugh told her
that he had noticed it her fathers voice
broke in and saved her from embarrass-
ment by saying

   barbara mr lynn is to stay with us
for a few days see that the couch is ready
for him and show him over the place
lynn-it was our acquaintance of moji
-extended his hand and murmured

   i am charmed miss barbara this is
a pleasure so utterly unexpected that i can
scarcely believe i am awake may i say
that tarani seemed a forbidding black rock
when i first saw it from the sea but closer
acquaintance makes it pure paradise
frankly pleased barbara met his smile
with her own merry eyes but the next mo-
ment she frowned and turned away to at-
tend to the guest chamber for she told
herself that no man but lancelot should
say such things to her goff as usual
saw little of barbaras changing expres-
sions he saw nothing of his guests open
admiration for his daughter thought noth-
ing of it until lynns quiet voice reminded
him that he had such a daughter

   by jove goff if i may venture to say
so miss goff is a stunning beauty what
a gem for such a setting

    yes i believe the child is growing fair-
ly good looking drawled the trader busy
with supper preparations lynn stared at
him blankly doubtful if such indifference
could really be genuine he decided it was
a pose and during supper he tried to draw
the father out by engaging the daughter in
intimate conversation which he led around
skilfully to the great outside world of
which he soon found she knew nothing

  surely he thought goff could not intend
to keep the girl cut off from everything
such a girl could obtain in civilized life
and he hinted at such things as he guessed
would arouse barbaras curiosity and the
trader rose to the bait readily

   i suggested taking barbara on a trip
he said  but she wouldnt go-would you
barbara she shook her head vehement-
ly and her serious aspect made lynn smile

  but you have no idea what you are
missing by remaining shut up here miss
barbara he said  you should visit a big
city at least once and see how people live
the clean-up



  she replied simply meeting his eyes with
a full and unaffected stare

   i have no interest in the cities or in
how people live in them i like the island
and i have all the people  want right here
then she avoided his gaze and colored
hotly

  lynn walked on the lonely beach late
that night his mind too wakeful to make
his couch attractive just yet and he could
not tear his mind from barbara goff try
as he would to accept her fathers estimate
of her as yet a child he could not blind
his own eyes to the true status of her-
that of a budding woman of a charm sur-
passing every woman he had ever seen and
he had in his official capacity met many
of the butterflies of the capitals and courts
he had visited

   an amazing little beauty he repeated
over and over -i perfect venus and just
full of natural good breeding for all that
she has never been to school jove

  so he continued far into the night lying
on his couch later on striving first to sleep
then to fasten his wakeful mind on the busi-
ness that had brought him there and
after a struggle he got the threads of his
thoughts to join arranging details in order
until his well-ordered mentality soon be-
gan working in its accustomed channels

  he had come to tarani on an errand sim-
ilar to many others which took him to queer
places the principal aid of a great offi-
cial it was part of his business to find men
for certain tasks and another part of his
work was to follow up and see that the men
he selected played their parts

  one thing about his selections was that
quite often he knew nothing concerning the
destination of the man chosen he simply
carried out orders of his own chief going
to a designated place at a designated time
and checking up results for it had been
known not often but occasionally that his
man had found the difficulties insurmount-
able and then lynn had been forced to re-
turn home to find a man to replace the dead
one that was yet another phase of lynns
work so keen had he become in his selec-
tions that in almost every case if his man
failed it was because death had taken a
hand

    	a-s

  now he was on tarani to follow up a
man he had selected and not knowing
which of his many selections had been sent
to this particular island he approached his
work with an open mind but felt slighdy
curious as to whether the man had realized
the beauty and charm of the amazing bar-
bara

  the thought troubled him for he remem-
bered every man he had picked for his
chief and although as yet ignorant which
one was here he remembered that every
one of them was of a type not at all likely
to overlook anything in the way of femi-
nine attractions	

  hell have to stick to his knitting and
leave the girl alone he muttered drowsily
just before sleep at length came to him
 none of those chaps is fit to touch such
an angels hand

  and the angel was hovering above him
as he dreamed his finely molded features
were set in a smile that transformed him
from a cold official into a warm pulsing
human being and barbara too smiled
as she slept but her angel was a hero with
merry gray eyes his aureole a mop of flam-
ing red hair

  and so both smiled the night through
all unaware of what the fates had cooking
for them in the caldron at that moment

chapter xxiii

barbaras knight

trader goff permitted nothing to
swerve him from the even course of
his daily life not even the advent of
a man of lynns stamp lynn had nothing
in common with any other man who had
at any time within goffs experience been
cast up on the little silver beach he was
quite obviously a gentleman one of that
capable class of unobtrusive men of action
from which goff himself most certainly had
sprung whatever his present standing or
the reason for it for this reason the trader
did not suggest as he had done even in
gurneys case that he make himself a resi-
dence for the duration of his stay but
placed his house at his guests disposal

 the place is yours lynn he said


all-story weekly

 if you require anything you dont see ask
barbara for it i am obliged to accom-
modate you since you bring such creden-
tials and do so gladly but youll pardon
me if i go about my business as usual i
hope and leave you in my girls hands a
fellow mustnt let chance visitors break up
his routine vknow

  that was all there was no curiosity
regarding lynns business no surmise as
to the duration of his visit goff left the
house without further parley and walked
off along the beach leaving his guest stand-
ing in the veranda gazing after him with a
subtle twinkle shining in the recesses of a
pair of keen inscrutable eyes there was
nobody to say it to so lynn merely
thought it but the most striking subject
of thought was what on earth the traders
business could be to demand such devoted
application

  but the morning was sparkling and full
of the wine of sea and breeze bringing to
the calm briton abounding vigor and am-
bition far along the shore he saw another
habitation but as he had watched the place
since taking his early morning swim and
had seen no sign of human being in the
near vicinity of the hut he had learned
nothing of his neighbor for goff volun-
teered nothing and no inquiry had been
made from the hut lynn searched the
sea and the reefs in quest of barbara feel-
ing eager to improve the acquaintance of
the amazing little beauty she had pre-
pared his breakfast but he had eaten with
her father alone and he felt that she was
either smitten with shyness or was playing
coquette with him

  the longer he sought the more intense
his desire became to discover exactly how
this girl measured up for be it under-
stood lynn was first and last a gentleman
in the strictest sense of the word and while
something burned in his breast which
warned him that the ice of his nature was
likely to melt under the glow of this girls
presence he was not the man to plunge into
ardent relations which might bring pain to
the girl afterward when he found that she
could never measure up to the standard of
his class

  so he waited impatiently hoping to see

her and willing to lay aside his more vital
business for a day or so if only he could
spend those days in a sweeter education
he looked of course for the flash of white
draperies he caught sight instead of a
distant brown sail which drew steadily
nearer on the fresh breeze and in which
he soon detected a single occupant whose
dress or skin he was not sure which at the
distance matched the sail in tint

  he believed the lone sailor was a native
and strolled off along the shore to pass time
until barbara chose to appear when he
returned to the house the canoe was in the
small surf and when the brown-clad figure
leaped ashore and ran the craft up clear
of the water he was halted with something
of a shock to recognize the girl he sought
and astonishment seized him when he real-
ized that if she had presented a picture of
beauty before she filled the scene now in
her wild untrammeled loveliness like a
vision of eve

  cold indifferent unemotional lynn had
grown to be in his official life his face had
been trained until whenever he chose it
was a mask to his true feelings but when
barbara saw him and ran to greet him
red-gold hair flying eyes sparkling star-
like bare brown arms and ankles gleaming
in the sunlight her ragged garment boldly
outlining shy charms that could not be hid-
den for all their innocent shyness the mans
throat went dry and the healthy tan of his
face turned a paler hue

   lynn you ass pull yourself together
he warned himself angry to realize his loss
of balance he forced himself to put on
an expression of outward calmness and re-
plied to barbaras greeting  what an as-
tonishing young lady you are miss bar-
bara just when a fellow expects to see
you as he saw you before you turn up smil-
ing like a sprite of the sea more charming
than ever

  do you like me like this she
laughed meeting his eyes frankly  this
is my every-day dress i do everything in
it

   i think it is the perfection of dresses
i am glad you only put on your holiday
dress for visitors this is ever so much
better
the clean-up



   oh i didnt put on my good clothes for
you mr lynn she replied with stagger-
ing candor you will scarcely ever see
me dressed different to this unless-unless
lancelot comes

  for a moment lynn stared down at her
animated face uncertain whether to laugh
with her or to ask questions she amazed
him in many ways and not the least by
her outspoken assurance of his subordinate
position as an inducement to feminine
adornment

  but a keen sense of humor underlay his
outward indifference and he thought he
saw in the girls glib mention of lancelot
the not very common but entirely plausible
spoken dream of a young girl living a lone-
ly life hoping that one day prince charm-
ing would arrive he decided to laugh and
she joined him in a peal of merriment that
placed them on a sound footing ol fellow-
ship

   let us hope that lancelot is delayed
then he smiled  while waiting for him
though wont you show me your island
your father has resigned me to your care
and i believe i admire him better for it
 lancelot will not be long delayed she
said slowly and her eyes wandered over
the mountain her piquant face shaded into
anxiety for a moment but she swiftly
shook off the mood and turned to scrutinize
her companion  i will gladly take you
walking she smiled  but do you expect
to keep up with me in those clothes

   why yes i think i can

   you will look a fright in an hour dear
man you see my dress  am ready to
climb crags swim surf run through the
jungle or slide down a cliff all these
tilings you will have to do if you follow
where i lead you had better let me give
you some of fathers old things all you
need is a pair of old trousers and a shirt-
unless your feet are tender then you need
shoes wait a minute

  she brought out a heap of garments
which certainly had long since earned the
description of old and thrust them into his
hands lynns face showed no intense joy
in fact the very touch of such nondescript
things almost made him shiver but he
would have gone clad as a native rather

than miss anything to be had by pleasing
barbara and he went into his part of the
sleeping veranda to dress such clothes
required little time to adjust he rejoined
the girl wearing with other things an apo-
logetic grimace but her dancing eyes and
parted lips thrilled him and amply repaid
him

   oh you look just like-you look really
truly able to keep up with me now she
cried and clapped her hands delightedly
and danced around him

   glad i suit your majesty he smiled
 nothing else can matter shall we take
some lunch

   it doesnt seem necessary i am first
going along to the castle to open the win-
dows for my lord we can have lunch
there

  he stared at her blankly doubting if
after all there might not be something
lacking in barbaras mental equipment
but she met his stare merrily there was
nothing of dark import in her eager face
no light of aberration in her glorious eyes
she set off along the shore chattering on
dancing over the dazzling sand like a sun-
beam and in spite of doubts lynn found
it easy to adjust himself to her mood he
entered into the spirit of her chatter and
played what he supposed was simply her
childish game of make-believe

   and is my lord from home he asked
 has lancelot gone off te the wars and
left my lady to care for his castles is
that the castle at the end of the beach

   yes that is lancelots castle he has
gone to the mountain to find the old witch
who sits up there he must not return and
find his house neglected so i must admit
the sea breezes to keep it sweet and clean

  there were moments as they walked side
by side when lynn was assailed with re-
curring doubts that would not down he
was willing to enter into the play of make-
believe but somehow he felt that the girl
was altogether too serious in her fun-that
she really believed in her lancelot his cas-
tle and the old witch of the mountain and
such a state of affairs was unthinkable he
resolved to speak to goff about it and urge
him to take her away on a trip before she
became obsessed with her fair-fancies


all-story weekly

for the time being he was willing to play
on and to make the most of his opportuni-
ties

  they reached gurneys hut and found
it as he had left it wide open but the
floor was covered with sand and rustling
crabs had usurped the domain barbara
seized a shovel and drove the intruders out
then fell industriously to work putting
things in place which were never out of
place and while she performed her labor
of duty as lynn interpreted it her face
glowed with ardor and the touches her fin-
gers gave to rough furnishings had the ten-
derness of love in them

  her merriment had softened to a smile
of joy in her work and the man felt as if
he were witnessing a rite almost too sacred
to be spied on he wandered around idly
waiting until the girl had completed her
task and as he allowed his eyes to rove
about the rough shack he caught sight of
an object which seemed slightly out of place
in such surroundings

  it was a book a stoutly bound volume
stained with sea water and hung up to nails
by means of a stick thrust through the back
binding he took it down and looked it
over it avas  the round table rescued
from the sea by goff and taken care of by
lancelot himself

   by jove this is a queer community
muttered lynn  fancy finding on one
potty little island a creature like barbara
and a poor devil of a beach-comber who
reads arthurs  knights  phew xo
wonder she calls him lancelot

  he flicked over the pages smiling at the
pictures perhaps recalling the day when he
derived keen pleasure in such things his
smile broke into a low whistle at the page
whereon was portrayed the perfect knight
-sir lancelot-for the knight was shown
snatching a distressed damsel from the
clutches of an army of low-browed churls
and beneath the damsels disheveled figure
was scrawled in a very fine young-ladyish
hand  barbara	

  softly he replaced the book on its nails
and felt that he had uncovered most of the
mystery

  if only the hut-lancelots castle-had
been vacant he could have established once
for all that barbaras knight and his castle
and the old witch too were simply
creatures of a childish imagination

  but the place was not vacant beyond
the fact that the owner was temporarily
absent and further consideration was
stopped by the girl herself his hands had
scarcely left the replaced book when a little
cry burst out beside him barbaras flying
figure flashed past and she seized the vol-
ume hugging it to her breast in ecstasy

   oh he found it he found it and pre-
served it for me when i flung it into the
sea in anger she murmured suddenly
aware that lynn was regarding her strange-
ly she flashed a defiant look at him and
cried

   oh you dont understand you can-
not understand dont look at me in that
way leave me leave me i hate you for
that smile

the flight

by sam s stinson

                        air as a radiant goddess was the maid
                           as rich as croesus he

                        and so they planned to make an even trade
                        nor knew that riches flee

he married her her beauty to enfold

                       but beauty fades away

                       she married him enamored of his gold-

                        in the same boat are they
charley wood

it was a comparatively warm morning for
early spring and the cook like the birds
and the worms was making the most of
it he was seated on the edge of the wharf
where lay moored his temporary home the
schooner benjamin hay when i came upon
him his rotund proportions occupied most
of the space between two spiles while he
swung his feet back and forth over the mud-
dy water of the bay and between puffs on a
disreputable corn-cob whistled a tune that
was obviously original

  he managed to make room when he saw
me however so i sat down and smoked
and swung my feet likewise

   he spoke with a quaint twist to his words
i had remarked it once and to my chagrin
for he had somewhat insultedly replied that
it was only because he had spent so man
years on british ships but that he had
been born right here in these united states
and was for the stars and stripes forever
and maybe  could show him better yankees
than his connecticut parents

  he launched into the following story
apropos of nothing as far as i could see
i had hardly more than got my pipe started
well when he began

  capn hosiah briggs hes the man i been
thinking on xo you never heerd of him
he was skippering afore your time in square
haven he was running mostly coastwise

in schooners up and down and up ana
down never his own owner and all the
time wanting a ship of his own and swear-
ing at the orders of his owners behint their
backs

  i aint sure if he knowed his own mind
women it werent women that was
the matter of him he was a bach forty
abouts set and free in his ways and if he
had any affection for women it was as por-
table as a deck-bucket i would say he
was a woman-hater if i didnt know there
aint any such at least i never seen one
and ive seen the world from every angle
including catty-cornered in the pacific to
upside-down in chiny

  he werent wanting of no home or no
wife or no children all he wanted was
good grub to eat and good licker to drink
and a ship of his own without no female
to interrupt

  it werent licker that was the matter of
him neither although he did like his little
swig orful well and always carried a few
cases along to sea that was how he lived
year in and year out free as a sea-gull in-
dependent as a pirate and changing of his
ship at the end of every cruise account-of
disagreements with his owners

  but there come a time when he went
about ship and steered off on another course
old sam judson was the cause of it sam
was an old shipmate of his whom he had



all-story weekly

sailed along with afore the mast he was
living out of his days at snug harbor the
skipper had just finished a cruise and they
was talking over things across a pair of
grogs in stapleton

  the skipper had let go the remark that
he was sick of life with the owners holding
a belaying pin over his head all the time
sam thinks a minute and up and says

   mebbe i ought to tell you and mebbe
i hadnt he says  but  know where is
the best schooner on this coast lying idle on
her hawsers for want of a good skipper and
shes owned by a pretty girl

   where the skipper wants to know

   square haven says sam  its the
bluebell what belonged to old skipper bill
banks he left her keel and topsl to his
daughter emly when he died now if
you only had as much sense with women as
you have with ships and was more and-
some-like thered be your chance

  the skipper looks at him hard and orders
two more grogs

   my looks and your opinion aint
mates he says  but how does it come
there aint nobody married her with a beau-
tiful ship and why does it lie idle

   because says sam  she aint never
met the right man shes that particular
she is and she dont want no sailorman for
a husband she wants a man what will
settle down and live home where he be-
longs and not be running off to sea so
there lies the hooker month in and month
out and gathering moss and rotting

   how old is this girl axes the skipper
 thirty-five or thereabout sam an-
swers

   a girl thirty-five year old says the
skipper  according to that im a boy of
forty and youre a youth of sixty-five but
i havent got no objection to the age

   o course not says sam  shes just
the age for to make you a good wife

   im not wanting of no wife now or
never snorts the skipper  i get enough
bossing from owners but he says  im
going to show you how good my looks are
and if i can manage women as well as
ships by getting that schooner without mar-
rying her

  then he gets up and walks back and

forth across the grog-shop rattling of the
pay in his pocket and thinking hard he
kept it up for so long that sam got tired
of waiting for another grog and went home
riled he was one of them what figgers
out the value of his conversation in drinks
and he figgered capn briggs had cheated
him bad

  that was why probly he left the skipper
to find out one important fact that he hadnt
mentioned during the conversation

  two days after that if you had been right
where you are now you would have saw
capn briggs he stands right on that
spot back of us his gear in a pile behint
him and looking at the bluebell she
lay right off there where you see them gulls
fighting over that loaf of bread she was
moored fore and aft sails stowed and shed
been there without moving an inch beyont
the slack of her cables for over a year

  the paint on her werent even soiled ex-
cept for the little rust streaks running down
from the scuppers and lanyards she was
a thing of beauty to behold she looked
snug and tight enough to be able to slant
off to sea the very next day the skipper
actually got to feeling ashamed of the re-
sponsibility of standing there letting such
a beauty lie idle

  so he stows his gear aboard the best
hotel in square haven for to make an
impression and cruises out in his sunday-
shore suit for to find miss emly banks

  old sam werent such a bad picker after
all the skipper told himself that when
he had passed up and down in front of
miss bankss cottage a dozen times and
seen her standing on the verandy the
twelfth she werent skinny and scrawny
with a peaked bow and a perpetual grouch
like he had been expecting of she had
one of them pleasant faces no gray hair
or wrinkles and was buxom of figger

   so far so good says the skipper to
himself as he stands there and looks her
over out of the corner of his eye  and it
makes it a lot pleasanter to find shes not
omely but ill have to steer blighted care-
ful because this house is moored plump be-
tween two hills and if i got moored there
for life id smother for want of breeze

  but seeing the lady had caught him
the courtship of the bluebell



standing there a looking at her he knowed
there had to be something done quick so
he walks through the gate

   im looking for miss emly banks
says he

   im miss banks she answers she
follers it up with a lamping of the skippers
lines that didnt make him feel comfortable

   my name is capn hosy briggs says
he he dont get no further because the
lady interrupts

   and you came to see me because im
the owner of the bluebell she says the
surprise of it all but knocking the skipper
backward  you think shes the most beau-
tiful ship you ever seen you think its a
shame for to let her lie idle on her hawse
and youre surprised for to find that the
owner of her is so young and andsome

  it took the skipper a minute for to get
his breath and then he slams his sunday
cap angrily on the ground

   wait till i gets a chance for to lay a
hand on sam judson chokes he hot as a
galley-stove  ill jam his topsls into his
keel for him the sneaky rat

  whos sam judson she axes

   dont you know he says

   never heerd of him she says

   then how did you know what i come
here for he inquires

   because she says  youre about the
dozenth sailorman whats come here since
my father left me the bluebell and they all
say the same things i know it all by
heart now

  probly if there had been a scupper there
on the verandy for to crawl into the skipper
would have done it for a long time he
tried to figger out something for to say but
seeing the lady had said all he had intended
to say for him he just give over and started
to leave without saying anything at all
he went down the walk toward the gate
and while he went she run her eye over him
from top to keel

  he had his hand on the gate when he
got another surprise

   mebbe youd like a cup of tea afore you
go she says

  the skipper comes back like a man in a
dream steps careful over a door-mat whats
on the top step and says  home sweet

home  on it and sinks into a chair on the
verandy awaiting for the tea while she
was gone he wondered if all them other
sailormen had been axed to tea and hoped
there werent no arsenic or nothing in it

  afore he was through he stowed away
four cups of it and he set right there on
the verandy with the people going by in
the street and staring of their lamps out
at him while he done it

  that was the beginning of the court-
ship

   im up agin a terrible hard course
says he to himself after he had left  be-
cause i wont never be able to fool this
one and a spoke of helm either way is liable
to stow me away forever between them
two hills

  he went back to the hotel and set in
his room thinking it over and smoking of
his pipe till three oclock in the morning

  it took him all of a month to lay out a
course he spent most of his time think-
ing it out in his room at the hotel and lay-
ing it as careful as he would have figgered
out a course arount the world in uncharted
waters

  he werent backward about making
promises so far as that went fie could
have taken a chart out of his sea-chest and
put his finger on more than one port where
there was females of more than one shade
who might still be waiting for him to fulfil
promises he wouldnt have bet no money
that any of em was still waiting though
no more nor you nor me would anyhow
they didnt own idle bluebells

  during this month he was a reglar caller
at the cottage the conversations between
em was mostly battles of brains because
she was always trying to steer it away
from the bluebell and he didnt want for
to talk about nothing else there was more
than once that she told him she would be
more happy if the hooker was sunk

  then one sunday afternoon when it was
too rainy for to set on the verandy he took
a long chance he was sitting in a horse-
hair chair in the parlor with pictures of old
people hanging arount him on the walls and
she a playing of the organ in the corner
the homelike things in that room always
got on his nerves


all-story weekly

  he got up all of a sudden and goes
over to the organ and takes a holt of her
hand he had saw a show the night afore
and his imitation of the leading man werent
bad considering there was no rehearsals

   you never knowed i read palms did
you he says

   no she says  read mine

  now i aint sure if the skipper had ever
read a palm in his life afore all i know
is that he wrinkled his forehead over her
hand and took on the look of a professor of
palmistry while he studies the lines

   youre going for to be married was
the first thing he says

   when she wants to know

   in about four or five year says he
and looks up in time for to catch a look
of disappointment on her face

   there aint no man going to be a court-
ing of me four or five year she says sharp
like

   but suppose says he still studying of
the lines  suppose the man aint got money
enough for to do it in less like the man
what shows in your hand here

   where does he show she axes looking
hard at the palm hes holding

   right there he says pointing to a
little line  theres the man what wants
to marry you and then ups and downs
what you see in it there that means he is
a sailorman and one of the best masters of
sail what ever walked a ships deck and
hes a man what would make a fortune
but for one thing

   what is the one thing she axes

   he aint got a ship of his own he
says iies an independent man who has
got to have plenty of freedom and be his
own boss or he cant be happy but youre
going to be cruel hard on him

   why she says

   that line what forks off there an-
swers he pointing to one  that shows
where his heart longs for to be out a roam-
ing of the seas and that other branch shows
where you want him to settle down in a
house whats smothered in between two
hills where he cant see or even smell the
ocean

   but how do i know what he would be
up to when he was off to sea she says

   he wouldnt be up to nothing he says
 because that big line what you see running
down there that shows that he dont care a
rope yarn about nobody but you and never
will up to the day he is hauled aboard
davys locker

  miss banks looked at him for a long
time and so piercing that he took to fidget-
ing in his chair

   what would you advise me to do about
it she axes

   theres only one thing you can do he
answers his voice kind of trembling  you
can become engaged to him and let him
charter the bluebell from you for about a
year say all aboveboard and right and
mebbe by that time he would have enough
money stowed for to marry without having
his heart broke by living between two hills
 but i have enough money for both
she says

   but you are forgetting hes an inde-
pendent man what dont want to live off no-
body says he

  she kept quiet for a long time again as
if she was thinking it over and the skip-
per got up and walked arount the room
studying the pictures on the wall and the
figgers in the carpet

   i guess she says after a while  if
i was sure he was all you say and wasnt
playing of no games id give him a chance
and let him try it

  he winked at himself in a long looking-
glass there on the wall and swung arount

   that skipper i was speaking of says
he taking a long breath  that was me

   i knew it all the time she says  and
i wish that ship was sunk

  well them charter papers was made out
the next day in front of a lawyer and all
regular and legal when the last signature
was on em the skipper looked acrost the
table and noticed miss banks was eying
him kind of funny but he was so glad for
to have the bluebell for a whole year that
he didnt pay no attention to it at the time

  the very next day he turned to get the
hooker ready he got a crew of swabs
aboard and had the time of his life a trim-
ming up of a ship for sea without having
no owners to worry of him at the end
of a week he had a walloping big cargo
the courtship of the bluebell



of sandstone aboard and everything ready
for to sail the next day for new york

  there werent but one hard job left ahead
of him and that was to bid miss banks
good-by and do it in such a way that she
wouldnt suspect he was glad to go

  he set in the cabin and took a few swigs
out of his little store of drinkables what
he always had aboard while he thought
comfortable like what would be the best
things to say to her the mate new shipped
the day afore set across the table and
helped him so far as the drinkables was
concerned

   i got to go ashore and say good-by to
my girl to-night the skipper says  thats
a job i hate a saying of good-by to
women

   you hadnt better drink no more then
says the mate looking greedy at what was
left in the bottle

   ill drink all i wants on my own ship
answers the skipper  what do i care
whether she likes it or not

  it was just about this moment that a
sailor sticks his head into the companion-
hatch and sings out

   theres a lawyer up here for to see you
capn

   send the lubber down says the skip-
per  i dont get up for no lawyers

  so down the companion come a little man
with big black-rimmed spectacles a reddish
nose and a hard hat he werent no young
man he crawled down the ladder a hold-
ing on with both hands lubber style and
at the bottom he stands and stares at the
bottle of spirits what sets there square in
front of him

   i come to see if you had any licker
aboard capn says he

   sure says the skipper pointing to the
bottle  take a glass and have a swig
i dont see what you come all the way out
here for to get a drink for though

  the lawyer didnt answer a word but
filled a glass right up to the brim and swal-
lowed her off without wiggling an eyebrow

   yes sir that is licker all right says
he  have you any more aboard

   aint that good enough for you shouts
back the skipper  thats five year old
and ninety proof

   im asking the question from a legal
standpoint i am answers the lawyer
 you see there was a clause in capn
bankss will about this ship that miss banks
didnt tell you because she was afraid your
feelings might be hurt a queer man capn
banks was in some ways

   for one thing he was dead set agin
licker now theres a clause in his will
what says there aint never to be any malt
distilled or fermented spirits aboard the
bluebell at any time

  capn briggs jumped to his feet his face
turning as purple as the water in the gulf
stream and out of his mouth shoots a
stream of langwidge that almost blows the
lawyer up the ladder ill tell you some
on it

   why werent i told about this afore i
signed that charter for a year he thun-
ders  im a free-born american citizen
and i got a right to drink when im thirsty
ive got five neat cases of good licker aboard
me and my cargoe is all stowed what do
you expect me for to do

   yoiull have to get rid of it and make
the best of it because its got to be off here
before the bluebell goes to sea says the
lawyer using a soothing tone  give them
cases of licker to me and ill throw em
away for you

   ill give em to you over your top you
shrivel-hulled hypecrite answers the skip-
per  if they have to be threw overboard
ill do it myself and be sure you dont get
none of it

   im sorry says the lawyer  but ill
have to see it all destroyed before i leave
the ship

  turning from purple to white the skipper
went in the pantry and come out with a
small case in his arms he went to the com-
panion and the lawyer being in his way he
bangs him agin the bulkhead and goes out
the door a minute after you could have
heerd a groan and a splash

  four trips the skipper made and each
time his face got more white and tragic

   that was the last one says he com-
ing down after dropping over the fourth
one he took a holt of the lawyers collar
and hustled him up the companion up on
deck he grabbed the first swab he seen


all-story weekly

   here you he says  jump into a boat
and pull this cripple-brained freak ashore
and if you can capsize the boat on the way
to the wharf ill give you a months pay
free

  then the skipper went back to the poop
where there werent nobody and uses ter-
rible langwidge agin the world

   here am i he says  a making of love
to a woman for a whole month for to get a
ship and now i got to go dry a year
liberty what kind of a country is it that
brags about liberty and allows a dirty deal
like this what i axes you did them sol-
diers back in  fight for if it werent
so we could have our swigs when we
wants

  one at a time the crew drops whatever
they were doing and turned pale while they
listened capn briggs hadnt never had no
bad reputation in fact he was an easy-go-
ing man as skippers go but they hadnt
never saw him crossed you see this hap-
pening had changed his whole nature

   theres a terrible hard cruise ahead
on us says the cook a sticking of his head
out from the galley and speaking to an
a b  we had better start a packing of
our gear afore its too late

   i dont want to be caught where i cant
get ashore with no man like that replied
the a b

  the skipper started in on the mate he
come in the cabin and found him setting
there drinking hard of the bottle on the
table

   im sorry says the mate  account of
the heart-breaking luck you had

   who axed you for sympathy youre
sorry because you got to go dry fires back
the skipper 

   whats the matter of you axed the
mate starting to get mad  why dont
you take your hard luck like a man and
make the best on it

   shut off that gas shouts the skipper
holding of a menacing attitude  or i jams
you through a port

  by that time unbeknownst the whole
edge of the companion was lined with the
faces of the crew pale and listening

   say says the mate  i aint standing
for to be talked to like that by no skipper

in port you go easy with your lip or
im packing of my gear and gone

   go  yells the skipper  go a rat-
tle-head like you aint necessary to the sail-
ing of this ship

   i aint wanting for to stay on a ship
as dry as a ham-bone says the mate

  he up and hauls out his sea-chest the
skipper grabbed onto what gear of his he
could lay hold on and slammed em into the
chest so hard there must have been nicks
in the bottom he werent gentle about
helping him over the side of the ship
neither	

  that was the beginning of the worst week
capn briggs ever put in he was like a
bear what had roamed free all his life and
all at once had a ring put into his nose
it werent that he wanted that licker so
bad neither but he couldnt bear for to
have it took away from him

  the next one to foul him was the cook
it was right after the mate had gone down
that he come down the ladder trembling
so hard that the vituals in his hands looked
like jelly

  the skipper set there a glaring while he
snuk arount unobtrusive like setting of the
table

   whats the matter of you you kettle
head the skipper growls  have you got
the ague or something

  the cook he looks up all nervous for
to answer while he shoves the bottle to
one side to make room for the dishes at
the same time and the next thing the poor
man knowed he had shoved it clean off the
table and the last swing on the bluebell
was a wasting on the deck

  he didnt wait for to hear nothing or
feel nothing but shot up the companion
and following close behint come all the
supper he had brung down as fast as the
skippercould heave it ten minutes after
away goes the cook pulling hard for the
shore and never to returnagain

  but the worst thing the skipper done that
night was when he made the a bs go to
bed without no supper there werent no
cook you see and theres them poor devils
afraid to tell him and a peeking at hirn and
dodging behint things when they seen him
coming till he couldnt stand it no longer
the courtship of the bluebell

i

   what are you sneaking arount like
hyenas for he yells at em  go into
the focsle and go to bed where you be-
long

   we aint had no supper begging of your
pardon sir says one respectful  and
its too early for to turn in

   go to bed when i tell you and dont
heave none of your guff roars the skip-
per he grabbed a holt of a piece of eight-
inch hawse what he had been saving for to
make a fender  in there with you he
yells  afore  slicks down your hair with
this 

  in they goes pell-mell and each trying
for to beat the other and before you could
wink your eye they was in their bunks
swearing hard under their breaths and re-
solving their time was short on the bluebell

  some time after that the skipper says to
himself  i cant drink on my own ship
says he  so ill go ashore and drink like a
common sailor

  and he done it

  he hadnt hardly stepped his foot on the
wharf afore them sailors was up and away
some didnt even wait long enough for to
take all their gear thats why the blue-
bell didnt sail the next day them a bs
had their revenge they did

  arount and arount they went a telling
this one and a telling that one and the
story getting bigger all the time like a
snowball rolling down-hill they told every
sailorman in port what a terrible man was
capn briggs and how a man would be
better off for to stick his head in a noose
than to go to sea on the bluebell news
like that dont take long for to travel among
sailors

  the skipper wont never forget the week
that followed he just couldnt get a crew
once or twice he had one all signed and
ready for to sail next day and went ashore
for to get one last licker and in the morning
there wouldnt be a man aboard agin for
a whole week he tried with luck going worse
and worse agin him because he got worse
tempered from the worry

  at the end of the week he couldnt get
even one man aboard and he was sick and
disgusted he took to setting in the cabin
a thinking he would do that for hours

at a time while he tried to plan some way
out of his trouble you see there was
the bluebell lying full of sandstone and if
he couldnt get a crew for to take her out
of square haven shed be there till her
charter run out

  more and more his mind went back to
them peaceful days afore he got the blue-
bell and that peaceful house between them
two hills then one evening he dressed up
in his sunday gear and went miss banks
was home and you would have thought
she had been expecting of him by the way
she acted

   emly says he a handing her some
papers  theres that charter pm done
with the bluebell and i hopes i never see
another ship as long as i live

   what then are you intending to do
she says

   well he says  id rather settle down
comfortable ashore where there wont be no
more ship troubles even if it is between
two hills

  she takes the charter and begin slow like
to tear it into little pieces

   so far as that goes she says a blush-
ing  we can move up on top of a hill
cant we

   i hadnt never thought of that says
the skipper

  right here the cook paused and the
wrinkles around his eyes became more pro-
nounced as he chuckled to himself he
was filling his pipe and suddenly he drew
the bowl from the pouch and pointed across
the harbor with the stem i followed the
imaginary line to where three sunken masts
reared their grizzled moss-covered trucks
just above the water

   see them he asked  thats the
bluebell not many knows it but capn
briggs sunk her himself what for so
he wouldntnever be tempted to go to sea
agin he said he hadnt never known what
real life was till he got married

  listen hear them reports like the
firing off of a double-action revolver
thats him hes got one o them automo-
biles what they calls flivvers now too
there aint a happier man in square haven
to-day there aint

 exit senor saunders

before they got home amy began
to awaken from her unnatural sleep
greg gave her over to the care of
bessie who had him carry the little figure
up to her room where by methods known
to herself bessie completed the restora-
tion

  greg learned that during his absence pa
simmons had sent in a message that de
socotra had returned to his apartment
about ten oclock in company with a young
spanish-american whose description sug-
gested henry saunders a little before
midnight de socotra had come out again
leaving the young man within and pa
simmons had followed him to the house
on east seventeenth street where pre-
sumably he was still

  no word had come from estuban de
silva still lay in his deep sleep

  as soon as amy had recovered she asked
for greg he found her sitting up in bed
pale great-eyed and smiling bessie it
appeared was not without a secret feminine
fondness for pretty caps and negligees
producing such articles from a hidden store
she had dressed amy up like a french
doll after a few moments the good-
hearted bessie made believe to discover an
errand down-stairs and left them alone

  but they had nothing to say to each
other that any one might not have heard
there was no constraint they gave each
other their eyes freely but they instinctive-
ly hung back from the deep waters of
speech they had been through too much
this story began in the all

to-night nature demanded a let-down
their eyes had reached an understanding
their tongues wagged irresponsibly

  by and by they heard the disturbance
incidental to a new arrival in the kitchen
below amy recognizing the timbre of the
voice looked at greg and said

   henry

  ginger mcafee came running up-stairs
though invited to enter an excessive deli-
cacy constrained him to deliver his message
from the other side of the door

   its the young spanish gent wants to
see miss him that come to the yard yes-
terday morning bulls watching him till
she says what to do with him

  amy looked at greg again

  said he  might as well get it over
with

  she nodded  let him come up she
called to ginger

  senor henry rushed into the room and
oblivious to the presence of greg fell on
his knees beside amys bed and reached for
her hand

   amelie amelie he cried a flood
of spanish followed

  gone was the high-bred disdain his
yellow face worked with the uncontrollable
emotion of a weak nature

  for some obscure reason amy blushed
and glanced uneasily at greg he no less
uncomfortable looked away

   get up she said curtly to the other
 speak english

  senor henry obeyed neither command

	 i shall not answer you unless you speak
english

  he made the attempt but it was not easy
story weekly for may 
the owl taxi



 for him to express his overmastering emo-
 tion in the unfamiliar tongue the stam-
 mering effect of it all was

  come away this is no place for
 you 

 this is where my friends live said
 amy coldly

 it was lost on him  come away i
 have a cab down-stairs

  where to asked amy dryly

  back to sehora de socotra

 and senor francisco no thank
you

  let me take you to a hotel then

  in this i have no other clothes
 senor henrys feelings were too much for
 him he relapsed into spanish

 amy clapped her hands over her ears
 speak english she commanded

 the dark-skinned youth guessing that
 the english was for gregs benefit shot a
 glance of purest hatred across the bed to
 amy he said

  tell the sehora the truth and she will
 leave francisco

  and die of a broken heart said amy
  id rather kill francisco

  but you cannot remain here among
 these people

  remember you are speaking of my
 friends amy warned him  answer me
 a question how did you know youd find
 me here

  i guessed it

  thats not enough how did vou guess
 it

  well francisco asked me to spend the
 night in his apartment so that the sehora
 would not be left alone he had to be
 out late bianca telephoned from the sana-
 torium that you had been carried off
 what was i to do i didnt know where
 francisco was i dared not tell the sehora
 what had happened bianca said it was 
 -he jerked his head across the bed- so i
 came down here

  you knew then that they had put me
 in a private madhouse said amy

 he shrugged

  perhaps you thought i was mad

  i did not i told francisco it was an
 outrage nothing i could say would move
 him what was i to do

   what steps did you take to get me
out

   francisco swore to me that it was only
for the night as soon as he could arrange
to get a private car he said he would send
us all home together

   why did francisco put me in that
place

  senor henry shrugged again  surely
you know that he had learned that you
were working against him in political mat-
ters i warned you you know

   you mean criminal matters amy
amended

  greg spoke for the first time  ask
him how senor francisco learned of your
activities

  - senor henrys shoulders and eyebrows
were agitated together  how should i
know

   did you tell him amy asked di-
rectly

  he sprang up  i did not tell him i
swear it you insult me by asking such a
question 

  amy turned to greg  what do you
know

  greg answered coolly  he told him
right enough

   its a lie cried senor henry turning
a little yellower than his wont  i might
have known who put that idea into your
head would you take the word of this
-this cabman against mine

  greg laughed

   when could he have told him amy
asked greg

   this afternoon when senor francisco
started from the apartment for the train
he met senor saunders at the door senor
saunders entered the cab with him and
they started down-town together he told
him then that is why senor francisco
came rushing back in the state that you
saw him

  the spanish-american youth fell back
rage and fright made his weak face
hideous a cold sweat had sprung out on
his forehead his teeth were bared

  its a lie-a lie he repeated i
never saw francisco until afterward how
do you know so much about my move-
ments


all-story weekly

   i drove the cab said greg simply

  senor henry stared at him speechlessly

  amy very quietly started to pull a hand-
some ring from her finger it was tight
it did not come easily both men watched
the action with a fascinated gaze she
finally held out the ring toward senor
henry he refused it with a passionate
gesture she let it drop on the floor

   go she said

  he burst out in desperate appeals re-
proaches excuses all in spanish

  amy turned wearily away

  greg stood up  youve had your an-
swer he said harshly  go before youre
helped out

  senor henry stopped short stared from
one to another biting his lip then turned
and rushed from the room as violently as
he had entered they heard the front door
slam behind him

  amy covered her face with her hands

  i am so ashamed she murmured
 to think that i could have thought-
even for a moment-that

    i-orget the manikin said greg calmly
 fie means nothing in your life

  greg heard estubans voice in the kitch-
en and hastened down-stairs their eyes
brightened at the sight of each other like
old friends estuban quickly explained
that he had been carried as far as phila-
delphia by the express on which he had
expected to find de socotra and had been
obliged to wait there several hours for a
returning train

 what has happened here he asked
quite a bit said greg dryly  weve
got both the girl and the book out of de
socotras hands that is to say we got a
book

   the little black book cried estuban
his black eyes gleaming  let me see it

  greg handed it over watching for es-
tubans verdict with more anxiety than he
cared to show

  estuban hastily turned the pages what
greg read in his face confirmed his worst
fears-amazement incredulity anger

  this is not it he cried he has
fooled you this is an impudent substi-
tute manufactured out of whole cloth

   i was half prepared for that said
greg gloomily

  estuban went on  this is what de
socotra meant to carry to the president
look testimonials of respect to his ex-
cellency addresses of felicitation from
public bodies of every class in managua-
the santiago chamber of commerce the
planters association and the rubber-
gatherers union the last is a master-
piece listen

   the rubber-gatherers union of managua
happy in their situation of a fertile soil under a
liberal government desire to express to his ex-
cellency the president of the united states-

   et cetera et cetera my god what
sublime impudence

   then our work is still to do said greg
grimly

   do you know where de socotra is at
this moment asked estuban with a dan-
gerous glitter in his eyes

   at a house on east seventeenth street
the headquarters of his gang he got that
book there earlier in the day

   it was made there under his direction
no doubt and the original is presumably
there

   if they have not destroyed it

   they would scarcely do that unless
they thought it was in danger of falling
into our hands think of the handle it
will give them against those who dare
oppose them in managua the unfortu-
nate ones who made those affidavits will be
marked men hereafter

   greg looked around the kitchen at the
men who were awaiting the outcome of this
talk and looked back at estuban the
corners of his mouth turned up with grim
humor

   lets go and get it he said suddenly

  estubans hand shot out to meet gregs

   my idea too he said with satisfac-
tion

   we have four good men here greg
went on  and a fifth is watching the house
now with the exception of de socotra
himself that gang is not formidable their
morale is poor

   what do you propose asked estu-
ban
the owl taxi



   the simplest plan possible-to get into
the house by force or by trickery and hold
them up are you armed

  estuban nodded

   they got a gun from me on our last
meeting ill see whats in our outfit here
greg and estuban were talking low-
voiced in a corner of the kitchen while
the others waited all thought of sleep
had been given up for this night even
bessie infected by the general excitement
had yielded to their solicitations in so far
as to prepare a small-hour supper the
clock had just struck three

   boys said greg  are you game to
turn another trick before daylight

   try us said bull grinning

   me and blossom was done out of the
best fun before said ginger

  greg briefly explained what had to be
done it appeared that their appetites
were only whetted for danger they
jumped at the chance even hickey en-
couraged by the size of the attacking party
perhaps did not bewail his fate this time
it transpired that both blossom and bull
possessed revolvers greg borrowed blos-
soms and let bull keep his-unloaded

  you wont mind if i empty out the
shells he said  estuban and i feel
that we ought to take the responsibility of
any shooting that may be necessary
bessie who had taken everything in
disappeared into the store and returned
with a small object which she offered greg
said she

   if youre going to break into the house
-mind i didnt say i held by any such
foolishness but if youre going to do it
anyway-better take my glass-cutter it
may come in handy

   bessie youve got a better head than
any of us cried greg  or maybe youre
more experienced in housebreaking

   go along with you mind you bring
it back safe i cant sell window-glass
without something to cut it

  when they were ready to start greg ran
up-stairs to bid good-by to amy he told
her what they designed to do

  it was at the hour of the night when
human vitality is at its ebb the plucky
lip trembled

   must you she faltered  on top of
everything to-night

   it must be at once while he is off his
guard he does not yet know of your es-
cape

if i culd only go too but to wait
here in suspense how can i endure it
oh this is a simple job

   simple you dont know francisco
 i must go send me with a smile
she smiled  i want you to promise me
something-you mustnt be angry

  pie looked his question

  her eyes searched his deep  i want
you to promise me you will not kill fran-
cisco i could not have that after all
he has cared for me for nine years and he
is the husband of the one i love

  there was more implied in this than was
spoken

  greg understood  i promise you he
said gravely- unless it is a question of
defending myself

   do not think that i mean to let him
go free she said  he shall be punished
terribly punished but it must be in the way
that i set

up-stairs and down

cyving all cabs at home this time they
proceeded in couples by different
streets to a rendezvous at the corner
of stuyvesant square greg and estuban
walked up fifth avenue then west to the
meeting-place thus passing the house that
was their objective

  their examination of it revealed these
salient facts-there was no light in any
window the basement windows were pro-
tected by iron bars the basement door by
an iron gate while above before the front
door heavy oak storm-doors were closed
in short an wholly unpromising prospect

   we need an ax to get into this said
estuban dejectedly

   well have to try the rear said greg

  the question was how to get around to
the back the whole block presented an
unbroken brick front from first avenue to
the square


all-story weekly

   at the square they joined the other men
and pa simmons who was there with his
cab the latter reported that de socotra
had not left the house

   damn glad you come said he  im
at the end of my wits how to m-ep watch-
ing that house without the police force
getting wise to me cab i watches from
this corner for a while then runs around
the block and takes a stand down by first
then i come back again but theres a
cop down theres got his eye on me already
i dont know where to go now

   you can be our mobile scout said
greg  keep moving drive through
this block every minute well signal you
if we need you

  pa simmons drove off

   at the corner where they stood there was
a modern apartment-house a space of
three feet separated the back wall of this
building from the side wall of the first
dwelling this crack offered the only dis-
coverable opening into the interior of the
block as the house they were seeking to
enter was the sixth from the corner it
meant that they must climb six back fences
to reach it

    bull how are you on climbing fences

	asked greg

    o k if somebody will hold me over-
coat

   hand it to one of the fellows estu-
ban bull and i will go over the fences
and break in the back way you other
fellows hide yourselves up and down the
block here but choose places where you
can watch that house if anybody comes
out you are to jump on him and frisk him
for the little bfack book see if it isnt
on him let him go if we get in the rear
all right and want your help one of us
will come to the front door and saw his
arm up and down so like a semaphore
there was a flight of steps down to the
rear basement door of the apartment-house
an eight-foot fence separated the narrow
yard here from the yard of the first dwell-
ing greg and estuban boosted bull up on
top bull from the top and greg at the
bottom hoisted estuban up then the two
already up reached greg a hand once
up they found the way was easier than

they had expected there was a longitu-
dinal fence separating the yards of all the
houses on seventeenth street from those on
sixteenth this fence was topped by a
three-inch plank along which greg and
estuban were able to walk upright bull
less sure-footed straddled it and hunched
himself along at one of the back yards
a cautious householder had set his fence
with great spikes against cats or marauders
here they had to drop down and go around
the sky was overcast and it was very dark
few lights showed in the back windows

  they reached the sixth yard at last and
silently dropped to earth the back of the
house facing them at first glance showed no
gleam of light but upon looking closer they
saw that the principal room on the second
floor was lighted in two of the three
windows on this floor cracks of light showed
around the edges of the opaque blinds that
had been pulled down two windows and
a door gave on the yard the windows
were barred so they could be left open
in hot weather but the door had no outer
protection and glass panes had been let in
the upper panels

   heres where the glass-cutter comes in
handy murmured greg good old bes-
sie 

  they wrapped a handkerchief around the
tool to deaden the sound as far as possible
nearest to the lock on the door greg traced
a square big enough to admit his hand
there was nothing to do but let the piece
fall inside

   if the sound of it brings them well
already be in said greg grimly

  he struck the outlined square a light
blow with his fist and it tinkled to the
floor within thrusting his arm through
the hole he drew the bolt and turned the
key

  they stole in greg gave his pocket-
light a swift flash around they were in a
kitchen a disused kitchen the range was
gray with dust the shelves empty

   wait here a minute till we see if they
were alarmed by the sound whispered
greg  keep on this side away from the
windows

  they waited holding their breaths to
listen not a sound was to be heard
the owl taxi



through the dark house except the rats
scurrying behind the plaster

  satisfied at length that the broken glass
had passed unnoticed they proceeded to
investigate their surroundings four doors
faced them two gave on cupboards the
third on a short passage ending in the front
basement room while the fourth opened on
the stair hall

  the other room on this floor was as
empty as the kitchen though so far there
was no sign of human usage they were
struck by the warmth of the house

   they dont stint themselves in coal
whispered greg  lets drop our over-
coats

  a door under the stairs gave on steps
leading to the cellar a gaslight had been
left burning down here they saw the
furnace that supplied the heat but there
was no person in the cellar

  greg left bull on guard on the basement
floor  if anybody gets past us up-stairs
dont let him get by you without frisking
him for the book if they come too fast
for you call for help

  greg and estuban stole up to the main
floor two long parlors front and rear
opened off the hall they were dusty and
empty like the rooms below at the head
of the next flight of stairs a crack of light
showed under a door and a murmur of
voices came down to them

  greg whispered to estuban

   creep up-stairs and listen it may be
valuable to us ill call the other men
in

  with infinite caution greg unchained
and unlocked the two sets of doors and
stepped out on the stoop the block was
empty but there were eyes out for
when greg gave the prearranged signal
three figures appeared from the shadows
opposite and noiselessly hastened to him
he drew them inside the house and shut the
doors

  hickey was sent to help bull because
there were two ways out from the base-
ment to be watched blossom was left at
the front door greg and ginger stole on
up and joined estuban at the turn of the
stairs putting his lips to gregs ear
bfetuban breathed

    	a-s

   were just in time theyre breaking
up here there are not more than four
men with de socotra in there the rest
have already scattered hes giving these
their final instructions now

  greg whispered back  is the door
locked

  l  dont think so theres no key in
the other side now that youre here to
back me up ill try the handle

   wait a minute front and rear bed-
rooms in -these houses usually communi-
cate ginger go in the front room and
stand guard take my flash

  estuban yielded first place to greg
greg tried the door it gave slamming
it open the two entered the room with their
guns before them

   hands up gentlemen said greg
there were four men three seated in
various attitudes about a table near the
window and the fourth de socotra ar-
rested in the act of pacing back and forth
the table was littered with papers sev-
eral valises stood about the floor the
three sitting men-abanez and alfieri were
two of them-flung up their hands without
a sound as if impelled by an electrical cur-
rent

  not so de socotra his nerves were un-
der iron control he actually laughed

  with his eyes fixed on gregs eyes he
coolly withdrew a cigarette-case from his
waistcoat-pocket took a cigarette tapped
it finically on the lid and stuck it between
his grinning lips returning the cigarette-
case from another pocket he produced a
match struck it on his shoe lighted the
cigarette and flicked the match away

   ah our good friend mr parr again
he said mockingly  really mr parr
you ought to be in motion-pictures or
perhaps you are to what do i owe the
pleasure of this call

  if he expected to rattle greg he mis-
took his man greg saw a telltale bulge
over the mans right breast and that was all
he wanted

  matching the other mans tone he said
 youre a remarkable man senor de
socotra i didnt want to lose touch with
you to-night i have brought an old ac-
quaintance of yours with me


all-story weekly

  de socotra for the first time looked at
estuban and his eyes changed the smile
became a trifle strained but the voice was
as cool as ever

   ah estuban how did you get out of
jail

  estuban was incapable of this grim jest-
ing it was his first sight of the man
responsible for the murder of his best friend
and his eyes burned

  he answered de socotra in spanish

  whatever it was he said it bit through
the elder mans veneer of scorn de socotra
snarled at him

  put up your hands said greg i
shall not tell you again

  de socotra obeyed but his expression
altered he looked beyond and between
greg and estuban and suddenly cried

   seize them both milio

  in spite of themselves they looked be-
hind them even as he turned greg was
half sensible that it was a trick but the
subconscious impulse was irresistible there
was no one there of course they turned
back

  de socotra was in the act of springing
toward an open door in the corner like
a flash estubans pistol sought him greg
knocked his hand up and the bullet went
through the ceiling de socotra disap-
peared the other three men green with
terror never moved

  keep them covered greg shouted
 ill get him

  he ran out through the hall and into the
front room crying  hold him ginger

  but he and ginger only collided with
each other in the empty room

   he didnt come this way gasped
ginger

  at the same moment back in the hall a
door banged open they ran out an
open closet door between the two rooms
showed the way he had escaped there
was no sight or sound of him there were
two other rooms on the floor-a bath-room
presumably and a hall-room-but he had
not had time enough to get a door open
and closed again nor could he have gone
down-stairs for there was no sound from
blossom at the foot

  at the instant greg made up his mind

that he had gone up a small bright beam
of light flashed athwart the upper flight
and threw a circle on the side wall from
above a voice said mockingly

   yes im up here mr parr come on
up when you cross that light ill give
you something to bring with you

  the voice did not come from the spot
whence the light issued evidently he had
laid his light on the floor and retreated
from it for an instant greg hesitated
then it came to him what to do ex-
tending his body on the steps pressing
close to the rail where one on the upper
landing could not see him he snaked his
way up a step at a time until he was
within striking distance of the light tak-
ing careful aim he fired the light went
out

  at the same moment he let his body relax
and slid back down the stairs but no
answering shot came as he expected nor
was there any sound of running feet above
de socotra as usual was bluffing while
the light lay on the floor he had stolen
away listening intently greg heard some
little sounds from the fourth and top story
of the house snatching his light out of
gingers hands he sprang up the stairs
ginger followed at his heels

  in the hall on the top floor stood a ladder
leading to a scuttle in the roof they
heard de socotra upon it working desper-
ately to raise the scuttle but they were
too quick for him as they mounted the
last flight he jumped down and ran into
the back room there all sounds ceased

  greg paused at the head of the stairs
it was a ticklish job to follow an armed
man into a dark room he tried to figure
out what de socotra would expect him to
do so he could do the opposite he had
left the door open behind him was it to
tempt greg in greg determined to try
to take him in the rear

  leaving ginger crouching at the turn of
the stairs he stole along the hall and ever
so carefully opened the door of the front
room in case his man were inside he
flashed his light in to draw his fire but
there was no sound

  he went in holding his light off to one
side of his body the room was empty
the owl taxi



absolute silence pressed on the house so
full of men

  there were two doors in the back wall
of this room greg cautiously opened the
first this floor was planned differently
from the second floor he found himself
in an extra middle room with a skylight
through which showed the low-hanging
clouds faintly rosy with the reflection of
the city lights

  returning he tried the other door and
found himself in a long closet or passage
leading to the rear he dared not flash
his light here for fear of giving warning
of his coming the passage was as black
as erebus the heaviness of the air con-
vinced him that it was closed at the other
end he crept on all fours feeling with
his hand before him half-expecting to lay
it on a human figure half-expecting mo-
mentarily to be met with a blinding flash
and a bullet

  he was stopped at last by a door which
must lead into the room into which de
socotra had fled he listened with his ear
to the crack but could hear no sound from
the other side if this door were locked
all his trouble would go for nothing he
found a match and inserted it carefully in
the keyhole it passed freely through
the chances were it was not locked

  if the man were still in the room there
was no possibility of getting this door open
without giving him warning so greg took
no care but suddenly flung it wide he
stood back and let his light shine through
still it drew no shot

  yet de socotra was in there greg
heard him run for the hall door greg
sprang after him but de socotra got the
door closed before he could prevent and
greg heard the key turn in the lock he
heard ginger tackle the man as he ran
around through the passage to the front
room

  little ginger was no match for this an-
tagonist de socotra must have shaken
him off with ease for ere greg could reach
the front-room door that too was
slammed and locked the middle-room
door was already locked and the key on
the other side greg heard de socotra
vault over the stair rail and run on down

  ginger shouted a warning through the
houseto blossom and waited to liberate
greg this took him a little while be-
cause de socotra had tossed away the keys
at random greg shouted to ginger to
open the middle door but in his excite-
ment ginger did not get the sense of it
he struck innumerable matches until he
found the key to the back room

  meanwhile de socotra had leaped down
two flights of stairs unhindered for estu-
ban dared not leave the three men he was
covering on the third flight de socotra
saw blossom waiting for him at the foot
and went over the rail he dropped in
the middle of the hall and ran into one of
the parlors here as blossom chased him
in and out the different doors he began o
shout for help in tones of mock fear

  these cries were too much for bull and
hickey on the floor below locking the
doors at which they respectively stood
guard they sprang up to the parlor floor
this was evidently what de socotra want-
ed he led them all a chase through the
dark rooms they collided with each
other and wasted their strength in vain
struggles thinking they had the fugitive
when he saw the way clear de socotra
ran on down the basement stairs

  by this time greg and ginger reached
the first floor- they heard de socotra
running wildly back and forth in the base-
ment below bull and hickey had had the
foresight to pocket the keys of the two
doors and he could not get out all the
windows in the basement were barred as
greg leaped down the basement stairs
with the other men tumbling after he
heard the cellar door bang open there
was no way out of the cellar except by the
coal-hole

   weve got him now he cried

  he was well assured that if de socotra
had had a gun he would have used it be-
fore this and he followed unhesitatingly
at the head of the next stair he heard the
furnace door clang and his heart sunk like
a stone the gaslight in the cellar was still
burning brightly de socotra stood by
the furnace stroking his mustache panting
a little but smiling still his hands were
empty


all-story weekly

  disregarding him for the moment greg
flung open the furnace door on the bed
of cherry-red coals the little black book
was already furiously blazing a hand
thrust in to rescue it would have been
shriveled to the bone there was no suit-
able tool handy greg had the inexpres-
sible mortification of seeing it fall apart
and dissolve in the flames an involun-
tary groan broke from him de socotra
laughed

  greg flung around furiously his gun up
 damn you i ought to shoot you like a
dog you murderer he cried

   but you wont said de socotra
coolly

  it was true gregs pistol arm was ren-
dered impotent but not as de socotra
thought because he was intimidated he
turned away gritting his teeth

  the other men were crowding into the
narrow cellar staring open-mouthed at de
socotra and waiting for a signal from
greg how to act after them came estu-
ban who had by this time succeeded in
searching and disarming the three men
and had locked them in their room on the
second floor

   where is the book cried estuban

   burned up said greg heavily

  estuban was hampered by no promise
to spare their adversary his gun went
up springing forward greg flung his
arms about him they struggled while
their men looked on at a loss how to act
no one noticed that de socotra had ma-
neuvered his position until he now stood
under the gas-light his hand shot over
his head and they were plunged in black-
ness before he could be stopped de so-
cotra gained the stairs trying to follow
him they jammed helplessly together he
slammed the door at the top and locked it

  with their combined weight it was only
a moment or two before they burst it out
but de socotra was already half-way up
through the house they reached the top
floor to find the scuttle open to the sky
there was no sign of him up and down the
roofs

  greg reluctantly called off the pursuit
 well only rouse the neighborhood he
has some way of retreat known to himself

let the last man through hook the scuttle
so he cant come back this way

  they left the three spanish-americans
to make their way out as best they could
if de socotra failed to return to their aid
they could always throw up the windows
and call on the neighbors it would be up
to them to explain how they came to be in
such a plight

  it was a dejected little crowd that made
its way back through the dark cold streets
to bessie bickles estuban was furiously
angry at being balked of his purpose

   why did you stop me he cried

  greg was not quite frank in replying
 i couldnt help myself he said  rich-
ly as he deserved it i couldnt stand by
and let you shoot down an unarmed man

   well never get him now muttered
estuban and relapsed into a sullen silence

  gregs own state of mind was not an en-
viable one to be so nearly successful
and then have his man flout him to his
face and get away laughing-it was too
much his heart burned in his breast
promise or no promise he knew there
would be no peace in life for him until he
had squared accounts with that smiling
scoundrel

  as soon as they opened the kitchen door
they saw from bessies pale face and
shaken manner that something fresh had
happened on this night of nights

  thinking -of amy gregs breast wrent
cold what is it he demanded

  the answer relieved his worst fears
 hes gone stammered bessie  the
spaniard up-stairs

   dead said greg astonished

   aye hes dead all right i went up
just now to have a look at him hes ly-
ing there bessie shuddered  i left him
till you come

   and amy

   shes all right asleep she dont
know

   send one of the boys for the doctor
said greg  ill go up alone first

  the light in gregs room was still burn-
ing de silva was lying on his back on
the bed his eyes open and staring small
wonder bessie had been frightened one
arm hung down over the edge of the bed
the owl taxi



the hand lying palm upward and open on
the floor a little bright object had rolled
from the nerveless fingers greg picked it
up a hypodermic needle

  on the bureau its case lay open be-
sides the bed for the needle it held space
for a vial of some blackish fluid no doubt
a further supply of the poison that killed
with a lightning stroke under the little
shagreen case was a folded paper addressed
in pencil to  gregory parr greg opened
it with fingers that trembled a little and
read

   i kept the needle i ought to have used it first
but it takes nerve to jab yourself it was easier
to jump overboard i can use it now when we
started for new york the old man gave me a
little book to carry important papers were
bound in it i never read them they were made
out in duplicate he carried one set and gave me
the other i meant to give them to de socotra
but i didnt want to after i didnt know what
to do with it i hid myself in a cheap little
hotel the day after the alpha house west broad-
way i had room no  i slit the mattress
and hid the book in the stuffing i suppose its
there yet if you want it

de silva

  the reaction from discouragement to
hope was sudden greg had to read the
note twice before he realized what it
meant he resisted his first impulse to
shout the joyful tidings down to estuban
better not raise his hopes until the prize
was actually in hand greg scarcely gave
another thought to what lay on the bed
this discovery dwarfed the importance
of the poor wretchs end five oclock of
a winters morning though it was he could
not rest a minute before going in search of
the little book he put the needle in the
case and the case in his pocket and de-
termined to keep his own counsel for the
time being if the doctor was  willing to
issue a death certificate without full infor-
mation so much the better

  to those in the kitchen he merely said
 i have to go out for an hour if the
doctor says all right send for the under-
taker hickey drive me over to west
broadway will you

  within the time he had set greg was
back with shining eyes in the kitchen
the disconsolate crowd sat much as he had

left them ginger and blossom slept with
their heads on the table bull and pa
simmons were talking in whispers by the
window bessie moved heavily around on
her interminable chores beyond the stove
sat estuban in an attitude of utter dejec-
tion elbows on knees and head between
his hands at the noise of gregs entrance
he lifted his lack-luster eyes seeing
gregs beaming smile a resentful scowl
lined his brows

   you seem well-pleased with yourself
he muttered

  greg without saying anything held up
the little black book before him estuban
gasped and hung undecided for a moment
then springing toward greg he snatched
it from his hands and scanned the pages
with burning eyes

   this is it he cried  thank god
we have him now

chapter xxii

nemesis

on the afternoon of the day following
these events amy and greg alight-
ed from the flivver at the door of
the stickney arms their pale composed
faces masked a great inner excitement for
they knew that francisco de socotra was
at home it had been amys idea thus
boldly to beard him in his lair ever since
she had got up that morning the direction
of affairs had been in her hands greg
looked at the little creature with a new
wonder and respect

  the hall-boy frank received them with
a broad grin not unmixed with slyness
the new clothes that bessie had got amy
made her look like a bride perhaps clear-
ly franks explanation of this visit was
that they were returning married for the
parental blessing therefore he looked
both disappointed and puzzled when they
sent up their names miss wilmot and
mr parr word was quickly returned
that they were to be shown up

  a new maid opened the door to them
to whom they meant nothing they were
ushered into the handsome living-room of
the apartment where senor and senora de


all-story weekly

socotra were both waiting amy was
quickly received into the other womans
arms who patted her and wept and bab-
bled incoherently de socotra whatever
his feelings were received them with a
happy parential smile that was perfection
his welcome included greg not by the
slightest sign did he betray any conscious-
ness of the events of the night before

  greg thought grimly  he feels that he
can afford to smile since the body of his
victim is reduced to ashes and the damn-
ing evidence of the little black book de-
stroyed too wait a bit old fellow
while amy and senora de socotra mur-
mured together senor francisco made
bland remarks on the weather his wicked
eye twinkling at greg as if to invite him to
enjoy the situation he offered greg one
of the incomparable cigars greg reflect-
ing that all this was for the benefit of the
gentle kindly little lady took it

   last night i pointed a gun at him and
to-day he comes back with a cigar he
thought lifes a funny affair

  amy said to greg deprecatingly i am
lying to her poor dear i am telling her
that i was so much better to-day that they
allowed me to come out for a little while
in your care

  admirable murmured de socotra
sehora de socotra shyly nodded and
smiled at greg and said something to amy
that was evidently intended to be repeated
to him there was a charming childlike
quality in the little lady that was wholly
irresistible

  amy said  she asks your pardon that
she cannot speak your language she
wishes me to thank you for taking such
good care of me

   she thinks youre one of the keepers
chuckled de socotra

  through amy greg made his best com-
pliments to sehora de socotra

  amy soon rose to go her adoptive
mother clung to her piteously and would
not let her go until amy promised to re-
turn the next day  perhaps to stay de
socotra accompanied them into the hall
expecting no doubt to learn there the real
object of this call nor was he disap-
pointed

   francisco said amy coldly  it is
necessary that mr parr and i discuss with
you what is to be done

   come into my room said de soco-
tra

   no we cannot talk here while mama
knows we are still in the house we want
you to come to us in gibbon street

  de socotra elevated his fine eyebrows
 that would be thrusting my head into
the lions mouth he said humorously

   are you afraid taunted amy

   my dear the bravest man has to exer-
cise ordinary prudence or the days of his
bravery would be few

   mr parr saved your life twice last
night

   another time he might not be so for-
tunate

   francisco i pledge you my word that
no harm will come to you while you are
there and that you will be allowed to go
as freely as you come

  de socotra looked at greg

   i add my word to miss wilmots said
greg stiffly  moreover there is no ob-
jection to your bringing any friend or
friends with you as many as you like

   but if i still feel obliged to decline
this charming invitation said de soco-
tra mockingly

   you will not decline it said amy

   why will i not

   because in that case i will be obliged
to tell mama the whole truth about what
has happened i am taking all this trou-
ble for the sake of sparing her if you will
not help me in that then affairs must take
their course regardless of consequences
 what affairs asked de socotra with
a great parade of innocence

   what is the use of making pretences
among us three we know and you know
that we know

   but no one else knows was the smil-
ing reply  and there is no proof in ex-
istence

   you dont know what proof we have
come to mrs bickles house and we will
lay our case before you you can then
decide whether or not you care to accept
the conditions that we lay down

  de socotra hesitated bravado and
the owl taxi



simple curiosity struggled with the mans
sense of prudence above all he was a
gamester

   when do you want me to come

   it is four now we will expect you
between five and six

   very well ill be there

  upon the stroke of half past five de
socotra drove up to bessie bickles in a
taxicab he made the man wait amy
and greg met him at the front door he
came alone

   you are a bold man francisco said
amy

  amy had changed to a black dress which
set off the unrelieved pallor of her skin
like alabaster the little creature now
had a consecrated air like a priestess that
added inches to her stature greg who
was wretchedly ill at ease regarded her
with a kind of awe she was the leader
now a strange hush brooded over the
little house the shutters of the store
were up

  amy led the way up-stairs de socotra
notwithstanding his pretended assurance
was impressed by the change in her dress
and manner all the way up he talked
lightly to conceal his uneasiness

   what an odd retreat you have chosen
i thought we should never get here my
chauffeur had never heard of gibbon
street nor any one else for that matter
what shocking streets we came through
picturesque though if one cares for that
sort of thing

  no one paid the slightest attention to
this babble at the head of the stairs amy
opened the door of bessies bedroom and
passed in de socotra was still talking as
he followed her greg was behind him

   houston street reminded me of rome
in juvenals day with its-

  the sentence was caught up in a gasp
it was never completed bessies room
had been transformed into a little mortu-
ary chapel everything in it had been re-
moved and the walls hung from ceiling to
floor in grim black draperies the effect
was startling in the extreme it had been
designed to startle in the center of the
room the sole object it contained rested a

plain black coffin on a severely draped bier
six tall candles stood about the head light-
ing the face of the corpse strangely it
was the face of de silva peaceful waxen
and faintly yellow

  greg fascinated watched de socotra
amy disdained to look at him her gaze
was bent like nemesis on the poor clay
de silvas face showed a dignity it had
never known in life one saw the man he
might have been stilled now yas the wild
spirit that had been touched too late by
kindness

  de socotras bronzed face turned gray
and a network of tiny dark veins showed
under his skin one realized the mans
age he breathed like something hurt
but kept his back straight and his gaze
never faltered from the dead mans face

   where did you-where did you- he
began twice but did not finish

  amy without speaking pointed to a
note pinned on de silvas breast de so-
cotra seeing that he was expected to read
it came forward his nostrils twitched
a pained look showed deep in his eyes
one guessed that it afflicted him with nau-
sea to approach the body of his hired as-
sassin but his iron will was not yet broken
he stooped and in the light of the candles
began to read with a sneer it was the
note de silva had left for greg

  as he realized what it implied de so-
cotra sharply straightened and for an in-
stant looked wildly around like a trapped
creature but he quickly controlled him-
self he turned his back on the coffin

   so this is your proof he said and
god knows what effort it cost him to bring
it out so nonchalantly  but hes dead
too 

   follow me said amy

  she opened the door that communicated
with bessies parlor an overpowering
breath of sweetness was wafted forth she
passed in de socotra followed to the
door walking steadily but with a gait
somewhat stiffer than his wont at the
door he put out a hand to steady himself
his eyes looked wildly around the next
room and he chew back a little as if his
flesh refused to be subjected to a further
horror


all-story weekly

  this room too was a resting-place of
the dead-but with a difference great
many-branched candlesticks stood around
this rich bier flooding the room with a
pale gold light roses pink and white and
red were everywhere sheaves of roses
heaped on the coffin and strewn on the
pall

  amys expression was very different as
she stood beside this bier she was still a
marble woman but it was a marble head
of grief her hands involuntarily went to
her breast she gazed down oblivious
alike to de socotra and to greg greg
looked at her and experienced the mean-
ing of adoration

  de socotras horror-stricken eyes were
fixed on the ceiling anon they darted
frantically from side to side like rats
threatened by fire in the end he had to
look his eyes were dragged in agony to
the dead mans face a groan was forced
from the bottom of his breast at that
moment the debonair scoundrels spirit
broke his head fell forward his limp
arms dropped to his sides

  he saw the face of antonio bareda
beautiful in death the lips seemed to be
on the point of breaking into the old
friendly smile there was a slight lift to
the eyebrows that suggested light and hu-
mor lurking behind the lowered lids the
wrinkles of age were all smoothed out
the happy warrior slept the long sleep

   come closer said amy remorselessly

  the broken man had no thought but to
obey he approached the coffins foot on
sinking knees the change in his face was
shocking he saw that the dead man held
clasped in his hands the little black book
in which was bound up  the happiness of
a whole people but de socotra regarded
that indifferently now

  he whispered hoarsely  it is enough
i understand you turning he made his
way toward the hall door like a man strug-
gling against a crushing power like a
swimmer at the last gasp

  wait said amy

  reaching him she held out the little
shagreen case  something of yours that
i wish to return to you she said with
dreadful meaning

  greg shuddered de socotra dropped
the case in his pocket

  at the foot of the stairs he paused again
without looking at amy he murmured
 will you come back-and stay with
mama

   if i do not find bianca there

   i shall send her away at once

   very well i shall be there to-night
when the door closed behind him greg
burst out  you cannot go it is too hor-
rible 

   it must be gone through with she
murmured

  early next morning greg who had
paced his room the night through received
the expected summons francisco de so-
cotra had been found dead in his bed
heart-failure the doctor said how
should he have noticed the tiny needle-
prick on the mans throat the needle it-
self had been destroyed before he came

  senora de socotra was a piteous figure
later in the day she insisted on seeing
greg to thank him for his kindness at so
dreadful a moment in a strange land
overwhelming as was her grief there was
no bitterness in it she spoke of it as sim-
ply as a child amy with the tears run-
ning down her cheeks translated for greg

   if you could have known him as i
knew him so good a man so kind and
true like a knight of olden times my
knight i could not live without him
did i not feel that he had left me a work
to do he has left a great fortune they
tell me every penny of it shall i devote
to good works in his memory if i cannot
be happy i can at least find peace in build-
ing a worthy memorial to his dear name
when they left her amy said  you
understand now why i acted as i did

   i understand greg said

chapter xxiii

conclusion

the news of the deaths respectively
of antonio bareda and francisco de
socotra reached managuay simul-
taneously many surmises were given rise
the owl taxi



to but the truth never became known-or
at least it was never published the
bodies of the two citizens arrived on the
same ship and their funerals were held
on the same day

  little inconvenience was thereby caused
for there were few in managuay who de-
sired to attend both ceremonies one cor-
tege was followed by the rich and the great
whose sleek countenances bore the conven-
tional expressions of grief while behind
the other followed on foot an endless pro-
cession of the weeping poor

  de socotras wife and adopted daughter
brought his body home and on the day
following the funeral senora de socotra
in memory of her husband presented to
the republic the magnificent estate of casa
grande with its famous jardin des plantes
to be held in perpetuity for the benefit of
the people sehora de socotra and miss
wilmot as the younger lady was there-
after to be known then departed for
paris to arrange for the magnificent mau-
soleum that the widow designed to erect

  the simultaneous deaths of these two
men left managuays political situation
very unsettled the government deprived
of its strong men who had ruled for so long
from behind the curtain scarcely knew
where it stood the people having lost their
champion were too apathetic to take ad-
vantage of the governments weakness
for a while things went on outwardly as
before then it became known that the
united states minister a well-meaning
weak soul who had been an involuntary
tool in the hands of the exploiters of ma-
naguay had been recalled and one greg-
ory parr appointed in his place

  when in due course mr parr arrived
the people were surprised by his youth
he brought with him as secretary a ma-
naguayan mario estuban and the poor
people took heart on the occasion of his
first call on the president of managuay
mr parr displayed a knowledge of the in-
ternal affairs of the republic that appalled
the functionary further mr parr made
certain representations that resulted in the
hasty resignation of the president and his
entire government and a new election was
called

  during the interim influential gentle-
men both managuayan and american
called on the united states minister and
it was rumored that heated interviews took
place the minister remained polite and
unyielding at the same time currents
that were set in motion in washington to
have him removed failed of their effect

  as election day drew near a united
states cruiser made a visit of courtesy to
the harbor of managuay the sailors were
received with the wildest enthusiasm by
the crowds she remained until after the
event no armed force was landed her
mute presence in the harbor was sufficient
for the first time in years the managuay-
ans voted as they pleased a truly popu-
lar and representative government was re-
turned which promptly got down to the
work of correcting the abuses of the former
regime curiously enough business was
not ruined as had been so freely prognos-
ticated dividends continued to be paid
while the workers sang at their work
capitalists discovered in managuay as
elsewhere that oppression did not even pay

  toward the end of the winter senora
de socotra and miss wilmot returned to
santiago de managuay

  amidst the misty verdure of the jardin
des plantes under the great moon of the
tropics sauntered a happy pair

   when did you start loving me greg
 when you touched my arm outside the
garage and asked me if that was my car
 but i was in boys clothes then

   my heart told me you were not a boy
when did you start loving me

   on the way home in the cab from
bessies when we quarreled so violently

i	cried all night

   oh-o then the way to reach your
heart is by quarreling with you

   oh it wouldnt work now i see
through you too well 

   i love to have you see through me
how sweet it is to have you laugh at me
and love me still

   i like to have you love me but im
not sure that i like to be laughed at
perhaps you can teach me to laugh at my-
self

  rphe glory that was greece and the grandeur that was rome  are scarcely more
 than tantalizing phrases or hazy images for most of us yet every lad who
 jl left a high school with a graduation certificate knows athens and rome were
 the outstanding citadels of classic culture and an ancient civilization and greece sur-
 passed rome as an original masterpiece surpasses a copy however brilliant

     as long as men continue to revere beauty and esteem reason hellenistic art and
 literature will remain the mountain-tops of human achievement colleges may dis-
 pense with languages but life can never wholly transcend the classics or the classic
 spirit even in a good translation greek literature however must remain for most
 of us an unexplored country to make the greek playwrights or the attic philoso-
 phers intelligible much less palatable considerable training and a certain scholarship
 are necessary

     in offering next weeks new serial we feel we have accomplished an original thing
 in fiction publication and put all-story weekly readers in possession of the magic
 wand that will lift the curtain that protects the treasure-trove of ancient greece
 this story more definitely approximates the greek attitude toward life than any
 modern work of fiction we could name and the author is a ripe scholar whose work is
 shot through with greek feeling and beauty

daughter of lyssa

by b j r stolper

 will lift you out of the whirl and welter of the present and transport you to the magic
 simplicities of a world where machinery and conventional morality were as unknown as
 electricity and steam professor stolper is more than a fascinating writer he is a
 classic authority as well and his story is more than a meretricious imitation of an
 ancient model or an historical caricature-it is a living embodiment of the native
 greek spirit in all its tragic intensity in all its passionate beauty

     in advance we must warn you this is not a modern romance and conforms to none
 of the romantic gestures of the modern story always in the offing of the grecian
 mind fate loomed large a portentous menace the tragic note was dominant in
 grecian drama stolpers story rings true to his greek models

     we await with no little curiosity your comments on a piece of work which we
 think stands out because of its sheer beauty and pure tragedy mya and poias will
 not disarm all criticism but we much mistake our public if the discriminating reader
 and the seeker after  something new  do not both agree they have found it after

the baboons sister that has for its
background a mining-camp in alabama the
characters are three strong men-strong in differ-

zines combined i loaned a great many of them
two years ago and lots of them i never received
again so i dont like to lend them only to some
true lover of books one that appreciates the all-
story weekly as i do i got the ali-story
weekly fever and a pretty bad case  assure
you the first winter i spent in florida and it is
now included among the household necessities as
something that cannot be done without oh say
i also would like to see a sequel to  palos of the
dog star pack with the best wishes to the
all-story weekly and its readers i remain

  really there is little use to procrastinate longer
when i know full well that eventually i will
write the all-story weekly is the strongest
little magazine i know and i am an inveterate
and promiscuous reader of magazines generally
heart to heart talks



one week recently i was very much annoyed to
find that every news-stand in battle creek had
sold out of the all-story weekly and i had to
go clear to kalamazoo to get one i wanted very
much to know what became of whistling dan
you see just now i am down deep in austin
halls  into the infinite that man cer-
tainly has an enviable wealth of imagination
 the rebel soul  appealed to me very strongly
-back in iq wasnt it june   in
fact i was so deeply impressed i tried for a while
to become a rebel needless to say i fizzled
but i am like roselle i refuse to listen to any-
thing uncomplimentary about george wither-
spoon i want to say i admire your faculty of
selecting manuscripts that  carry a wallop and
that the all-story weekly is the only magazine
i can read from cover to cover without finding
fault success to you and may your  eagle eye 
never dim while you retain the power of choice of
stories	j p robinson

thinks tex and whistling dan
happier unmarried

to the editor

  guess ive got a right to say a few words in
praise of the all-story weekly the greatest and
best little magazine on the market i have been
a reader for over three years and i can say that
i like all your stories for they are clean and dont
run on the same lines as in some magazines we
the all-story weekly readers are privileged
characters-read a little of everything believe me

  now about two stories i read lately  the
texan  and  the untamed some people it
seems didnt like the way they ended but say
why condemn the poor fellows tex and whistling
dan burry to a married life dont laugh mr
editor i am not married and never was and
you probably are tex and whistling dan are
too good to be tied down to a married life so let
the poor fellows alone to enjoy life a while no
doubt some heroes deserve to be married but
those two dont i myself hate to see a good man
go under and tex and dan are good doesnt it
get monotonous to know that when you start to
read a story the poor hero is going to get it in
the end that is why i like dumas he did not
marry all his heroes in the end so let the good
work go on and let some of these poor heroes
enjoy life a little longer i say

  abdullah is one of your best writers wish you
wouldnt let any of his stories get away  master
of the hour  was one of the best stories i ever
read i am reading  into the infinite it sure
is great nothing more to say only that i havent
missed a number of the all-story weekly for
three years and the only time i will will be when
i can read no more for the all-stoby weekly
is the one and only for me

the best at any price

to the editor

   the conquest of the moon pool  is the first
story in any magazine which i immediately re-
read upon completion mr merritt has so clever-
ly used scientific facts and theories of the forma-
tion of the earth and earth life in the explanation
of phenomenal plants and beings and their en-
vironment in his  different  story that it seemed
perfectly realistic and possible the descriptions
are wonderfully beautiful the humor in the
character of larry brightens the story throughout
it is a perfectly  satisfactory  story-all things
explained without pedantry and ended consistent-
ly i do not like to see the all-story weekly
quoted as  the best magazine of its price it is
the finest fiction magazine at any price its very
reasonable price cannot be taken as an indica-
tion of its contents but as an indication of its
tremendous circulation and of the fact mentioned
by s s mcclure that it is a magazine  which
does not spend as much money on the cost of
paper as it does in good judgment in selecting its
contents

   the labyrinth  is especially good its origin-
ality is refreshing its humor exquisite i very
much liked  on the spur of the moment  and
the blue jay as well as all of the roxy
malone stories who wants a green bottle
is unusually gripping i like herman howard
mattcsons stories  janie frete intruder is
the best of the janie frete series i thoroughly
enjoyed  allatambour  and  pug-ly-gug-lo i
i am now interested in reading  children of
night and  misery mansions i liked  a
good indian and  the grouch but never
read e j raths slap-stick comedies like too
many crooks et cetera

see all-story weekly for august 

to the editor

  i come begging information where oh where
has h bedford-jones gone to please page him
see if he cant be found another  please -not
quite so frequent on those  different  stories
like them why surely i like them but they
tire me all out take for instance  the con-
quest of the moon pool why after reading a
chapter of that id be as tired as if id done a
days work

   misery mansions -theres something that
appeals to me-it was great ask e k means if
he cant get a little more body you might say
into his stories theyre good no question of it
but outside of several amusing situations arising
theres nothing to them i am keeping what i
call a review on the all-story weekly in the
first place i think i can lay claim to as many
back numbers of the all-story weekly as any
reader you have lacking about twenty magazines
i think since the first day of publication


all-story weekly

  now for my  review i have a note-book in
which i insert the name of a serial i have liked
exceptionally well along with the number of parts
and date of starting in this way i have a splen-
did library of the best in fiction when a person
wishes to read a book  just let them look over
my review pick what they want go to the book-
case in which i have all my all-story weeklys
arranged in numerical order and help themselves
please forgive me for taking so much of your
time what i started to do was merely to thank
you for the pleasant hours you have given me
but darn it when  get started talking all-
story weekly i dont know when to quit i
would like to plead with the other readers for a
sequel to  the untamed wishing a long life
to the all-story weekly ben f lobnow

 up-stairs  a whirlwind novel-
ette

to the editor

  just a few words of appreciation for one of
the best magazines on the market the all-story
weekly and it certainly is great i have been
reading it from the first instalment of  the
texan and that story was a peach and cant be
beat

  am going to tell you how i happened to be a
steady reader of the all-story weekly a
friend of mine gave me the last edition of  the
texan i started in reading the book but when
i ran into  the texan  story i stopped i asked
that friend what he meant by handing me the
last part of such a good story and believe me i
never let up on him until he brought the rest of
the story which he did and in due time too i
took the books home and settled myself for an en-
joyable evening i got it i never went to bed
till the wee small hours of the morning now i
am of the same opinion as the other readers-tex
is being badly treated when all he has is a posse
and the other fellow got the girl why oh why
cant we have a sequel

   the untamed  was great isnt max brand
going to give us a sequel or dont he know that
the wild geese are back and its time dan was
coming back to kate surely she deserves some
happiness and that can only mean dan

  all the otiter good stories are altogether too
numerous tj mention and there certainly are a
great many that need praise but one word for
e k means-he certainly is a gloom-chaser with
his stories and all i say is let him keep the good
work up

  am now deeply interested in  into the in-
finite and so far it promises to be some story
i cant blame roselle for loving george could
do so myself even if he is a rebel soul

   up-stairs  was some whirlwind of a novel-
ette and it surely was good in fact all the
novelettes are beyond criticism

although i am not a subscriber i have not
missed a single copy of the all-story weekly

since i started reading it it isnt that i am just
lucky but i always manage to be first in line at
our bookstore have often supplied others with
copies they were unable to get and i am sorry to
say the books never came home but never again
will i be so accommodating as i want to save
the books

  well i guess i have had my say but i could
not resist writing and letting you know of the
many pleasant hours i enjoyed and still hope to
enjoy more with the old standby the all-story
weekly i remain an ever-booster

  i have been reading the all-story weekly for
a long time but never have written to you people
before i like a story in serial form that you
dont know just who did it until you read all of
the serial and where it throws suspicion on more
than one person as in  the crimson alibi i
like the serial stories best i read every story in
your magazine and wish the authors and the
editor the best of success and hope you will have
more good stories must close as i think j said
enough	f h h

  i am interested in the all-story weekly i
think it is just great the best i have ever read i
like all the western stories in fact if i were to
tell you the stories i like i dont think i would
ever stop this is the first time i have written
to you so i wish good luck to the all-story
weekly i have just read the untamed and
think it just fine hope we have some more like
it hoping to have more good stories to please
everybody	mrs b thorpe

  you are certainly printing a lot of ai stories at
present being a westerner my favorites are
stories of the great open west will say that i
havent read a poor story in the all-story
weekly yet of course some of them are better
than others naturally would like to read an-
other story of peter gross and the argus pheasant
the stories all the way through show that the
author knows something of borneo would also
like a sequel to the texan well ill close
saying that the all-story weekly is the best
magazine printed regardless of cost or authors
and i have read them all

the chance of indulging the pleasure i take in
reading recently though on my vacation i
heart to heart talks



happened to chance through the all-story
weekly and came across the first instalment of
 safe and sane i started to read it and could
not quit indoors until i had finished it i eagerly
anticipated the concluding instalments and was
not disappointed mr robbinss philosophic
humor and originality appeal to me strongly
there is a real pathos in the character of peter
pottingham the fat grotesque old billionaire
with his tragic history suffice it to say that i be-
lieve mr robbins to be a man of real literary
merit and one whose work seems head and
shoulders above the average magazine writer i
hope to see more of his work and will watch
your magazine with that object in view

  i am a new reader but i have spread the seeds
of its propaganda this is how your magazine
readers grow a boy told another boy about the
all-story weekly this boy then told me we
began taking it when  the conquest of the moon
pool  began and i think that a merritt should
write a sequel to it another of my friends see-
ing my interest in the magazine bought a copy
when  pug-ly-gug-lo  started and he has kept
it up since he after a little persuasion got one
of his best friends to try it he bought the april
 issue and all that afternoon nobody could drag
him from it i always read heart to heart talks
somebody had a letter published that said that
the short stories were best well he is wrong-
very wrong the serials are the main part of it
and i think most people think so i think that
this magazine is the best on earth and i think
all of its readers think so also

 indianapolis indiana	roy johnson

  i am forced to write you a letter although i am
a reader of your magazine for only a short period
but have realized since that it is the best on the
market barring none and i have been a steady
reader of quite a number of them

  i have one kick to register and that is it makes
me keep the midnight oil burning and it is late
in the morning when i close your book

  every story has a punch of its own and it al-
ways hits the bulls-eye

  one thing i do want and that is a sequel to
the untamed get after max brand right
hard and i  reckon  he will come across

  i would also like you to send one of your
authors to akron the rubber city sometimes
known as the city of opportunities to get in on
the aero races which will come in the early part
of may to be given by the akron aero club i
am sure one could get a good actual-place story
with the races as the  object

  please find enclosed coin for which please send
me the all-story weekly for the week of april
iq i was unable to get it at the time it came in
and  do so much enjoy reading the stories they
are so good i dont know which i like best
 the untamed  and  broadway bab  sure
were some worth reading  ready to occupy 
was simply great i hope the authors of those
stories will see their way clear to give us some
more like them please give us some more of the
good old western stories i like those as there is
always something doing and you dont feel like
going to sleep as this is my first letter to the
all-story weekly i hope it doesnt find the
waste-basket wishing every success i remain

  no doubt you will be surprised to hear from
one of your readers who lives in saskatchewan
canada but i have just finished reading the story
by max brand  the untamed i think that
that story was the best you ever published is
max brand going to write a sequel to  the
untamed i truly hope he will i would like
to ask you a question mr editor i didnt read
the story the rebel soul by austin hall
can i get that story in book form i read the
ali-story weekly every week now and i think
it is the best magazine i ever had in my hand
trusting to hear from you by return mail

  note the rebel soul has not been pub-
lished in book form but we can supply the num-

  i have been reading the all-story weekly
for several years and just thought i would tell
you how i enjoy reading most of the stories i
like the serials best  the texan  was sure
great but poor old tex was sure left out bad-
we would sure appreciate a sequel to  the
texan and also the untamed whistling
dan is probably tired of chasing wild geese by
now so please bring him back in a sequel  the
red glory  that is starting in the all-story
weekly promises to be some story i guess this
is enough for this time will close with very
best wishes for success dont forget tex and
whistling dan	mrs j f tilman

so well i dont like them at all i read one of
them and that was enough for me  broadway
bab  is about the best story ive ever read and
close behind comes the case of madeline
patris i liked twenty-six clues and the
untamed  just line but who is there that did
not like the untamed that receding
brow  was fine as all of max brands stories are
 claire  and  ready to occupy  were ripping
although i did not read all of them i liked
 suspense well i will take up no more of
your time for i know you arc always busy
wishing the all-story weekly such prosperity
in the future as they have had in the past

sive inflection drew from revel a quick
sidelong glance colored by a faintly ap-
prehensive crinkling of eyebrows

 je suis he murmured and waited watchfully

divining the subtle tribute in this attitude
mrs lathom smiled the smile of ironic intro-
spection which is one sign of humored vanity-a
smile that lingered as she pursued

 larry-how long have you been pestering
me-

 pestering oh making love

simply adore the way you play the game a
woman does like a man to rattle off a glib un-
blushing lie instead of fumbling for the truth in
a foggy memory any other woman larry
would let you get away with it just to show ap-
preciation of your uniquity

   uniquity lovely word makes one feel
caught red-handed in something agreeably aban-
doned	

   so you have been caught-fibbing we met
here in the crystal room ten months ago to-
night seeing angie earle just now reminded

 well-tell me how long have you any no-
