  there is little question but what properly func-
tioning kidney and bladder organs are vital to the
health insufficient kidney excretions are the cause
of much needless suffering with aching back weak-
ness painful ioints and rheumatic pains headaches
and a general run-down exhausted body this con-
dition also interferes with normal rest at night by
causing the sufferer to rise frequently for relief and
results sn painful excretion itching smarting and
burning i am ot the opinion that cystex definitely
corrects frequent causes poor kidney functions of
such conditions and  have actually prescribed in my
own practice for many years past the same ingre-
dients contained in your formula cystex not only
exerts a spl- ndid influence in flushing poisons from

from penthouse to shantytown-manhattans latest murder
took its devious and dangerous course

midnight call

thil collins glanced at
the clock on the house
switchboard in the lobby
of the vandoria apart-
ments five minutes be-
fore midnight in five minutes he
would be off duty

collins had been working for two
weeks as substitute elevator opera-

tor at the vandoria apartments he
was not an elevator boy by trade he
was a radio repairman but he had
been ambitious in  he had
opened a radio shop of his own
sinking his savings into a lease
equipment and a modest stock the
radios that he had bought in 
to sell for fifty dollars were selling
to-day for twelve dollars but col-
lins was no longer selling them his
own stock had gone under the ham-


fm

ife is

mer at a creditors sale in 
since then he eked out a bare living
at whatever odd jobs new york
could offer-sometimes at his own
trade more often at anything he
could pick up at the employment
agencies his job running the van-
doria elevator had come after a lean
period of nearly two months even
it was only a temporary arrange-
ment although collins hoped that it
might work into something steady
until things picked up again in the
electrical line

the next day was pay day but
collins would not get anything he

had already drawn two weeks wages
in advance his pinched thin face
had convinced the superintendent of
the building that he had not been
eating regularly and got him the
advance most of it went to pay his
back room rent which was still more
than a month in arrears the last
few days his landlady had been com-
plaining again collins was wonder-
ing if he could dare ask for another
advance to quiet her clamoring when
the indicator m the elevator buzzed
insistently again collins glanced
at the clock one minute to mid-
night this would be his last trip


street  smiths complete stories

  he stepped into the elevator cage
and closed the doors he looked at
the indicator panel a red light
glowed opposite the figure  he
moved the control lever and the car
began to mount

  the eighteenth was the penthouse
floor there were two penthouses
atop the vandoria apartments-one
on each side of the roof the call
for the elevator undoubtedly came
from penthouse b the tenants of
penthouse a were quiet people and
always retired early the man in
penthouse b however was a queer
duck william wight was his name
the week previous when collins
had been on the elevator for the mid-
night-to-noon shift wight had twice
rung for the elevator at four in the
morning coming back at six he
was a big powerful man with a
shaggy mane of hair snow-white in
contrast to his bushy black eye-
brows he had a young face with
an aggressive bulldog jaw he wore
thick-lensed spectacles with octago-
nal frames he had a gruff com-
manding voice which collins had
heard only uttering curt disagree-
able words he seemed on the
whole to be a generally disagreeable
as well as mysterious person quite
different fom his daughter at least
collins thought the girl in pent-
house b was his daughter he
thought a good deal about the girl
in fact-too much for an impecuni-
ous temporarily employed elevator
operator to be thinking about the
daughter of a man who lived in a
penthouse-if she were his daugh-
ter

the elevator stopped at the
eighteenth landing collins
slid the doors open he
waited no one came into the car
he stepped into the hall looking in
both directions there was nobody

in sight he wondered if he had
read the indicator wrong he
stepped back into the elevator per-
haps he had penthouse b on the
brain perhaps the call had come
from the seventeenth floor he was
about to drop down a floor and see
when the door of penthouse b
clicked open

  collins watched expectantly the
door swung inward very slowly as
though the person opening it were
trying not to make a sound it was
fully five seconds before collins saw
that the person was not the snowy-
maned william wight as he had ex-
pected but the dark-haired gray-
eyed girl he supposed was wights
daughter the girl was wearing
lounging pajamas she beckoned to
collins

  collins crossed the hall in three
strides the girl laid her forefinger
across her lips collins stopped

  will you do me a favor mr col-
lins the girl asked in a whisper

  why s-sure collins stammered
the girl knew his name she must
have inquired of the superintendent
about him

  the girl drew an envelope from
the ample sleeve of her pajama
jacket and handed it to collins it
bore a typewritten address to mrs
harry daggett at a number on east
thirteenth street

  would you see that this note gets
to mrs daggett she asked

  ill mail it right away collins
replied

  dont dont mail it please
the girl made a little frightened
gesture of protest you must give
it to mrs daggett personally
dont give it to any one else and
by no means give it to her if she is
not alone tell her its from june
shell understand dont let any one
see you give it to her

  shell get it first thing in the
fog over the river



morning said collins putting the
letter in his pocket ill do just as
you say

 youre awfully good said the
girl she was standing against the
door holding it slightly ajar with
one hand behind her im afraid
im putting you to a lot of trouble
no trouble at all miss wight
said collins

 my names not wight said the
girl its june lawn

 then youre not-

  collins did not finish his sentence
the door behind june lawn was
pulled abruptly open the surprised
girl fell back a step against william
wight whose shaggy mane towered
above her trim dark head

 what do you want wight
barked at collins his powerful
frame was clad in a black silk dress-
ing gown

 why nothing said collins
cowed by wights hostile glare

 i rang for the elevator said
june lawn quickly i asked this
young man to leave a note for the
superintendent-our electric refrig-
erator isnt working right

 how often have i told you that
if you want anything youre to ask
me or the housekeeper growled
wight pushing the girl back into
the apartment go to bed

 he slammed the door

  collins got back into the elevator
the indicator was buzzing-base-
ment the midnight relief man had
arrived and was waiting to come on
duty collins closed the doors the
car dropped

in the basement collins turned
over the elevator to his relief
man and started changing his
clothes he heard the telephone bell
ringing in the superintendents base-
ment quarters he heard the super-
intendents sleepy voice collins

had just removed his uniform when
the superintendent shuffled out of
his quarters pulling his suspenders
over a woolen undershirt

  evenin collins goin home for
the night asked the superinten-
dent

  silly question thought collins
the superintendent knew he was off
duty at midnight he said yes
sir

  we owe you any money asked
the superintendent

  no sir i drew two peeks pay
in advance you remember

  the superintendent nodded

 then you dont need to come
back to-morrow he said

 you mean youre changing my
day off

  no you got all year off you
dont need to come back

  it took several seconds for the
significance of the superintendents
words to sink in even then collins
wasnt sure he had heard right

  im-im fired he asked

  the superintendent nodded

  tough luck he said

  but havent i been working all
right whats the matter

  theys been complaints said the
superintendent

  collins stared suddenly he un-
derstood the telephone call to the
superintendent a moment ago had
been from william wight the man
in penthouse b had demanded his
dismissal wight had misinterpreted
the interview he had surprised be-
tween his daughter and the elevator
operator but the girl wasnt
wights daughter she had said
her name was june lawn whoever
she was wight was obviously ob-
jecting to her talking to collins
objecting even to collins being in
the vandoria apartments

 did the complaint come from
penthouse b asked collins


street  smiths complete stories

 the superintendent yawned but
did not reply

  tough luck he said turning to
go back to bed hope you find an-
other job night

collins put on his hat and
went out a cold drizzle was
wetting the streets it was
late autumn collins pushed his
hands into his pockets his fingers
touched a quarter and two nickels-
his entire capital he would walk
home it was two miles but he was
out of a job again and the subway
fare would buy him a cup of coffee

  he was wet with rain by the time
he reached his rooming house the
house had a chill musty smell about
it the stairs creaked as he started
to walk up when he reached the
second landing the door opened
the landlady stuck out her head
she was fat and her yellowish-gray
hair was done up in leather curlers

 you got that back rent you owe
me mr collins asked the land-
lady

  not yet said collins

 you better get it to-morrow
said the landlady theres been a
gentleman around wanting to rent
that room o yours its the only
room i got vacant-since a room i
dont get no rent from is the same
as vacant the gentleman is coming
back to-morrow

  ill get you your money to-mor-
row said collins he knew he
wouldnt he hadnt the slightest
idea of where he could get any
money he continued climbing the
creaky stairs

 collins slept badly it was not
so much the knowledge that he was
out of a job again that worried him
the bitter struggle of the depression
years had equipped him with an un-
complaining stomach and a sort of
numb resignation to unemployment

even the prospect of eviction with
cold weather coming on did not
bother him as much as the short
mysterious interlude at the door of
penthouse b what was the rela-
tion between william wight and
june lawn why had wight
wanted collins dismissed from the
vandoria apartments what was
the nature of the letter that june
lawn had given him to deliver to
mrs harry daggett in person and
alone-and to the obvious ignorance
of william wight since the girl had
concealed the true reason for her
ringing for the elevator

  the mystery of the letter was in
some prospect of being cleared up
for collins got up early to perform
the mission with which june lawn
had charged him

  he walked to the east side ad-
dress typewritten on the envelope
he found the house in a row of brick
tenements in a street noisy with
children and bedecked with laundry
drying on fire escapes he went up
the stoop and tried to push by a man
standing in the doorway but the
man stopped him

 who do you want asked the
man he was slim in his late thir-
ties and dapper with a kind of
threadbare elegance he wore a
fuzzy fedora hat that had once been
black but was beginning to take on
a greenish tinge with age the nap
on the velvet collar of his coat was
worn smooth moth-eaten spats cov-
ered some of the shortcomings of his
pointed black shoes

  im looking for mrs harry dag-
gett said collins

  the man in the black fedora did
not remove the arm which blocked
the entrance he coolly looked col-
lins up and down

  mrs daggetts not here he said
after a moment

  when will she be back
fog over the river



 cant say what do you want
with her

  ive got a message for her said
collins

  you can leave it with me said
the man ill see her when she
comes in

  collins shook his head

  its personal he said

  whos it from

  none of your business said col-
lins

none of your cheek countered
the man im a friend of mrs dag-
getts im trying to do her a favor
so am i said collins ill be
back later

  make it to-night said the man
about nine

  collins went away he spent the
rest of the day looking for a new
job for an hour he moved among
the little crowd of dejected-looking
men whose hopeless eyes scanned
the placards in front of the employ-
ment agencies in the shadow of the
sixth avenue l he answered a
dozen wanted calls eleven of
them were already filled when he
arrived the twelfth man wouldnt
take him because he wasnt married
and had no dependents at the end
of the day he went back to his room-
ing house to rest his tired feet the
landlady wouldnt let him in

the gentleman came back she
said i rented him your room
youre more than a month behind
give me my suitcase then said
collins

  ill give it to you when you pay
me the back rent you owe me
when collins had gone the land-
lady suddenly remembered that a
telegram had come for him that
afternoon it was upstairs in her
room stupid of her to have forgot-
ten it as there might have been a
telegraphic money order in it she
would go up and see

  the landlady ripped open the yel-
low envelope addressed to collins
she breathed a heavy sigh of disgust
it was not money it was from a
girl it read

 must see you to-night stop
come penthouse between ten
and eleven without fail stop
extremely urgent

june lawn

  ah these modern girls the land-
lady sighed the terrible importance
they put upon a date with their boy
friends and the terrible boldness
with which they told their boy
friends how much they wanted to see
them things had been different
when she was a girl

  the landlady tore up the telegram
with a feeling of great self-right-
eousness

chapter ii

shantytown

ciollins walked to the east
side again to try to find mrs
harry daggett he got in-
side the house this time the hall
was redolent with the odors of cook-
ing cabbage collins knocked at a
door at the end of the hall the
slim man with the black fedora
opened the door

  she came in but she went out
again said the man

  did you tell her i was looking for
her collins asked

  the man nodded

  maybe thats why she went out
again he said

  collins turned and walked away
the man came out closed the door
behind him and followed he
caught up with collins as he was
leaving the stoop

  ill walk a ways with you he
said which way are you bound

  i dont know said collins

  where do you live


street  smiths complete stories

  no place

  sleep in the subway i suppose
said the man

  i was thinking of it said col-
lins but i think id rather save the
nickel to eat with i guess ill go
up to the municipal flop house for
the night

  dont exclaimed the man in a
horrified voice

  its getting too cold to sleep on a
park bench said collins i may
as well get a free bed from the city
dont boy repeated the man
you look like a pretty good sort
dont start living in flop houses and
bread lines theyll break your
spirit keep your independence
boy ill show you where you can
sleep and you wont be under obliga-
tions to nobody

  collins looked at the man suspi-
ciously

  are you harry daggett he
asked

  good gosh and seven fishes no
declared the other with vehemence
my names hartford

  why dont you want me to see
mrs daggett

  hartford laughed

  why dont you want to tell me
what you want to see her about he
countered

  collins was nonplused he wished
that he knew the background of this
mission he had undertaken so readily
for the girl in penthouse b

  i aint in the habit of telling my
business to strangers he said

  hartford gave him a friendly pat
on the back as the two men walked
down the street

o k boy he said but i hope
you aint too proud to accept a
strangers hospitality--such as it is
thanks said collins what
are you offering

  nothing much said hartford
but itll keep you out of the cold

were coming to it just ahead east
river shantytown

  directly in front of the men the
street ran out on a short pier where
two squat tugs were tied up the
wind blew from the east river with
the cold smell of the tides to the
right a sweeping curve of lights out-
lined the span of williamsburg
bridge

  turn in here said hartford

  a hole had rusted through the cor-
rugated iron fence surrounding an
abandoned brickyard near the head
of the pier collins hesitated then
he stepped through the rusted fence
after all he had nothing to lose he
might as well spend the night here

on the site of the old brick-
yard extending for more
than a hundred feet along the
river bank was a motley collection
of makeshift dwellings some of the
huts were neatly built of scrap lum-
ber roofed with flattened-out oil
cans weather-boarded with strips of
worn linoleum others seemed to
have been thrown together from the
materials of a junk pile without ef-
fort at adornment some were mere
packing cases patched against the
elements with torn bits of tar paper
all of them were inhabited by men
who despite the fact that they had
been swept from the normal course
of life by the current of the world
economic crisis still had courage
written on their rugged faces en-
abled to preserve some semblance of
self-respect by the independent if
somewhat precarious existence of
this shantytown colony they had not
the defeated whipped-dog expres-
sion of the men collins had seen
standing about the doors of employ-
ment agencies

  ill introduce you to some of the
boys said hartford to collins al-
though it aint strictly necessary
fog over the river



names dont count here we never
ask anybody his name and half the
men dont bother to give them
youll have to meet mayor mike
though

  mayor mike lived in one of the
better-built shanties he was a
husky grizzled man of about fifty
with a full weather-beaten face cov-
ered with a gray stubble he seemed
more relaxed better fed than the
other men of east river shanty-
town

  this boy is moving in with me
mayor said hartford as he pre-
sented phil collins

  mayor mike looked at the new-
comer with keen but not unkindly
blue eyes

  ill talk to him handsome said
mayor mike disappear

  handsome hartford withdrew
from the shack leaving collins alone
with mayor mike mayor mike dw
not talk at once first he took a
stick from a pile of driftwood
stacked in one corner of the single
room and put it into a rusty iron
stove that appeared to have been res-
cued from some junk heap then he
took a corncob pipe from the pocket
of his blue flannel shirt filled and
lighted it with great deliberation
at last he motioned collins to the
only chair in the room the chair
had only three sound legs the
fourth had been improvised from a
barrel stave and a length of wire
mayor mike himself sat down on the
bed-a spring mattress resting on
the floor

  like to work kid he asked
finally

  ive always worked when i could
get a job said collins

  mayor mike nodded

  i dont mind that he said
never work myself interferes
with proper enjoyment of leisure
im tolerant though not like hand-

some hartford handsome an old
friend of yours

  not very said collins
handsome kind of looks down on
people that work mayor mike con-
tinued thinks its degradin he
talks sells people things they dont
want-gadgets for takin spots outa
clothes and rheumatism cures and
things like that but only when he
has to you partners with hand-
some in this new racket o his
no said collins then he
added that is not exactly

  he hoped he might find out some-
thing about this handsome hart-
ford who seemed to have constituted
himself an obstacle to collins deliv-
ering june lawns letter to mrs
harry daggett collins felt reason-
ably sure that the chief reason for
hartfords bringing him to shanty-
town was to keep him away from
mrs daggett

last few days said mayor
mike handsome hartfords
been out peddlin dinky little
lace handkerchiefs on fourteenth
street i dont know where he gets
em or who buys em women i
spose he says he gets two-bits a
crack for em aftd that theyre worth
a dollar mebbe all i know is that
handsome sthl seems just as broke
as ever i dunno what he does with
the money ever been in jail kid
never said collins

 mayor mike rubbed his pipe
against his nose reflectively

  it aint no disgrace necessarily
i been in jail in seventeen different
states nothin serious vagrancy
hard to keep from gettin vagged
now and then always got floaters
though thirty days the judge
says next morning sentence sus-
pended on condition you leave town
in twenty-four hours i leave
thats why the boys here call me


street  smiths complete stories

mayor i lived in jungles like this
or worse all my life these is nor-
mal times for me its new to the
rest of em they kind of count on
me for advice

  mayor mike stopped talking he
turned down an oil lamp which had
begun to smoke making a streak of
smudge on a picture of abraham
lincoln cut from the rotogravure
section of a newspaper and pasted on
the in-sloping wall of the shack
then the mayor of shantytown
stuck his head out the door and
yelled for handsome hartford

 handsome said mayor mike
when hartford appeared stooping
slightly to enter the lopsided door-
way as mayor of this shantytown
my main duty is to keep it from bein
wiped out by the cops you and this
kid up to any skulduggery

  not in the least said handsome
hartford

  what about them lace doohink-
uses you been peddlin these days
did you come by em honest or did
you swipe em some place
hartford brushed an imaginary
fleck of dust from the sleeve of his
coat and rearranged the imitation
pearl stick pin in his cravat before
he replied

  mayor he said at last you and
me never discussed ethics before so
id like you to clear up a small point
before i answer do you or do you
not consider taking advantage of a
low-down dirty crook to be steal-
ing

  mayor mike puffed on his pipe
seems to me he said that
cheatin a crook comes under the
head o legitimate business

  then my lace handkerchiefs are
honestly come by said hartford
promptly

  mayor mike nodded

  i guess the kid can stay with
us he said

  so phil collins went to sleep in
handsome hartfords shack that
night it was a small cockeyed
shack scarcely larger than the mil-
dewed mattress that almost covered
the floor from nails driven into
the walls of bare boards dangled a
sparse-bristled whisk broom and a
battery of empty clothes hangers
hartford carefully hung up his coat
and folded his trousers before don-
ning a patched pair of overalls in
which he was to sleep his over-
coat he used as a supplementary cov-
ering to the single blanket which he
shared with phil collins

collins worn out by a day
of walking to the ends of the
city in search of jobs which
did not exist fell asleep almost im-
mediately hartford did not hart-
ford lay awakefor a long time until
he was sure that collins was deep
in the unconsciousness of first slum-
ber then he jostled the youth with
his elbow collins did not awaken
hartford sat up he leaned over
collins going through his pockets
with quick deft fingers when he
found what he was seeking he got
up slipped on his shoes and left the
shack he walked toward the river
not far from the bank two men
were sitting in front of a fire burning
in a five-gallon oil can with the top
cut off hartford knew the men
only by the names of walrus a
leather-necked man with a drooping
gray mustache and red who lived
in the upturned automobile body and
drank canned heat

  standing a moment by the light of
the fire hartford examined the en-
velope he had taken from the sleep-
ing collins noting with satisfaction
the typewritten address mrs
harry daggett he inserted the
point of a pencil under one corner of
the flap and with a gentle rolling
fog over the river



motion of the pencil pried it open
without tearing the paper he moved
a few steps away from the fire and
turned his back to red and walrus
he took the letter out of the en-
velope a folded bank note fell at
his feet he picked it up quickly
it was a ten-dollar bill he put the
money in his pocket then he read
the letter

dearest isabel

  i am still convinced that the inclosed
money could be put to no better use than
ridding the world of your utterly worth-
less husband from what i know of him
i am sure that there are men who would
be glad to exterminate him for half the
price however i am a sentimentalist
at heart and since i have long ago given
up trying to put any sense into your head
i can at least put milk into the babys
bottle

  there was no signature

  hartford refolded the letter and
put it back into the envelope he
kept the money in his pocket he
walked to the shanty occupied by a
skinny beady-eyed man known as
slats an unemployed carpenter
who was responsible for much of the
linoleum-and-barrel-stave architec-
ture of east river shantytown
slats gave hartford a little glue
with which to stick down the flap
of the envelope he had opened then
hartford went back to his shack

 phil collins was still sleeping
soundly hartford slipped the rifled
envelope back into the pocket from
which he had taken it collins
stirred slightly but did not awaken

chapter iii

a black dog howls

  at seven oclock of the following
pk evening east river shanty-
i town was in the throes of a
crisis mayor mike was being called
upon to make the most difficult deci-
sion in his long career as solomon

of the unemployed municipal pol-
icy was being fixed

  its only for a few days mayor
argued handsome hartford he was
sitting on the mayors bed the
mayor himself was ponderously pac-
ing the creaky floor-three paces in
each direction-and puffing furi-
ously at his corncob pipe in mayor
mikes only chair sat a young
woman she had curly brown hair
and gray eyes that were a little
dreamy a little incomprehending
in her lap a six-month-old baby was
sleeping

  there aint no precedent for it
handsome said mayor mike
there aint never been any women
in shantytown

  shes in trouble countered hart-
ford why shouldnt a woman in
trouble be just as welcome here as
a man in trouble

  mayor mike passed a puzzled hand
over the gray stubble on his chin

  wheres she been livin hand-
some he asked

over in east thirteenth street
and why cant she go on there
shes got to hide out for a little
while mayor it might be a matter
of life and death

  whatd she do

  nothing said hartford but
theres certain parties who might
want to use pretty harsh methods to
keep her from telling some of the
things she knows

  how long you been takin care of
her handsome

  weve been friends for a good
many years said hartford we
used to live in the same little town
in indiana we went to sunday

school together-

 mayor mike laughed long and
heartily the thought of handsome
hartford going to sunday school
seemed to strike him particularly
funny suddenly he grew solemn


street  smiths complete stories

  the kid yours he asked

  no said hartford were just
friends shes got a husband
where is he

  last we heard he was in jail
said hartford

 mayor mike knocked the ashes
out of his pipe

  but you been sellin those lace
doohinkuses to feed the kid aint
you he asked

  hartford nodded

  and you expect the two of em to
sleep in that combination sieve and
water cooler you live in demanded
mayor mike

 for a few days-

 nope mayor mike shook his
head aint good enough the
kidd freeze no stove this place
hered be better i could move in
with slats temporarily

  mayor youre a prince

  mayor mike held up his hand

  it aint settled yet he warned
on a serious matter o municipal
policy like this i got to call in some
o the boys round em up hand-
some

  a moment later four of the lead-
ing citizens of east river shanty-
town crowded into mayor mikes
shack they were slats the carpen-
ter walru the mustachioed water-
front roustabout red the canned-
heat addict who lived in an aban-
doned auto body and a man named
spig who wore a blue-and-white
striped jersey a black beret and
dark sideburns the men stood si-
lently gazing at the sleeping baby
in the womans lap while mayor
mike explained the situation

 handsome thinks we ought to
take em in for a few days con-
cluded the mayor whats you
gents opinion

  no one spoke the baby woke up
and cried a little its mother spoke
to it in unintelligible maternal syl-

lables the baby stopped and started
sucking its thumb the men seemed
embarrassed

 you got to remember said
mayor mike that a kid like that
cant eat fish chowder and stale
bread all the time like us

  ill take care of feeding it said
handsome hartford

  walrus took a timid step forward
and bent over to examine the baby
the baby smiled took its thumb
from its mouth and reached out to
pull walruss left mustache wal-
rus blushed under his weather-
tanned skin the other men
laughed

  kind of a cute little tike said
walrus

 whats her name asked slats

  harry said the babys mother
shes a he

 whats you gents opinion
asked mayor mike again

 i dont see no reason why they
cant move in said walrus if they
dont mind the company

  sure echoed slats

 how about you red asked
mayor mike

 red shifted his weight from one
gaping shoe to the other

  o k by me he said

  spig

  the man with the beret and side-
burns shrugged his shoulders

  guess its all right he said

  so east river shantytowns first
woman was admitted to residence
with no further identification than
that her babys name was harry

it was after ten oclock and the
new residents were asleep in
mayor mikes shanty when phil
collins returned to the river colony
in the deserted brickyard he was
again worn out from having walked
the streets all day in a fruitless
search for a job from having once
fog over the river



more tried in vain to deliver june
lawns message to mrs harry dag-
gett he found handsome hartford
reading a magazine in his shanty by
the light of a brass kerosene head
lamp that had once graced a 
automobile

 howdy said hartford i
thought maybe you werent coming
back

  i brought something to eat said
collins sort of a rent payment a
fat lady proprietor of a kosher deli-
catessen down the street let me wash
dishes and sweep out the place in re-
turn for some food i had her give
me something i could share it
ought to be fine for a hungry man
itll spoil your appetite and you
cant eat much

  he held out a paper bag

  what is it handsome hartford
sniffed suspiciously

  pickled herring said collins
good gosh and seven fishes
hartford exclaimed thats about
all we eat around here-fish wal-
rus used to work down at the fulton
street docks and has a lot of friends
in the wholesale fish market he
goes down three-four times a week
and brings back enough for spig to
cook a community chowder for all
shantytown

  she gave me a loaf of rye bread
too said collins

  slats has a friend on a bakery
wagon who donates us all his stale
bread said hartford if you like

stale bread-

  sorry said collins maybe i
should have brought caviar

  dont throw the herrings away
said hartford somebody can use
them

  too bad they arent red her-
rings said collins you might
use them yourself-to drag across
the trail of mrs harry daggett
where you hiding her

  tell me who gave you the mes-
sage for her and ill tell you where
she is hartford replied

  thats still none of your busi-
ness said collins

  hartford shrugged his shoulders
indifferently

  suit yourself he said putting
down his magazine and blowing out
the lamp good night sleep well
collins didnt sleep well despite
his fatigue he dozed only by fits and
starts a cold fog had crept up from
the lower harbor blanketing east
river like a chill premonition of dis-
aster the moisture dripped from
the patched roofs of shantytown
steadily relentlessly the damp
cold seeped into collinss very bones
he started half awake at every
noise and the night was full of
noises tugboats hooted mourn-
fully as they groped their way up
and down the fog-bound river a
thin wail like the cry of a baby
penetrated collinss sleep at inter-
vals toward dawn the baying of a
dog supplanted the infants bawling
it was a persistent unpleasant howl
as though the dog were complaining
of death it appeared to come from
near by too probably within the
confines of shantytown collins
wanted to get up and throw a rock
at the dog but he was unable to
shake off the grip of a druglike sleep
which was neither slumber nor com-
plete wakefulness then a woman
screamed-almost in his ear collins
thought-and he sat upright his
nerves tingling

by the gray half-light of a foggy
dawn collins saw that he was
alone in the shack he had
not heard hartford go out he got
up and peered out the door he saw
a young woman running up from the
river bank toward mayor mikes
shack


street  smiths complete stories

  she was bareheaded her curly
brown hair streamed behind her head
as she ran there was terror in her
gray eyes

  handsome hartford was running
after her loudly calling isabel
isabel

  collins was struck by a strange
sense of familiarity about the young
womans features at first he
thought he knew her then as she
and hartford disappeared behind
mayor mikes shanty collins knew
why he had a feeling of recognition
she reminded him strongly of june
lawn something about her was
like the girl in penthouse b the
eyes perhaps even the expression
of terror was not unlike the expres-
sion he had seen flicker for a moment
in the eyes of june lawn when wil-
liam wight had suddenly pulled
open the penthouse door behind her
three nights ago

  collins saw mayor mike ambling
down toward the river bank-rap-
idly for a man of the mayors usual
slow deliberate movements other
residents of shantytown were piling
out at the womans scream walrus
a black woolen watch cap pulled
down over his ears was running
spig was crawling out of the piano
box red was already at the waters
edge

  collins put on his shoes he
heard the chimes of the metropoli-
tan tower a mile away pealing
clearly on the moisture-laden air
five oclock he too started for
the river

  the white phantom of a sound
steamer moved slowly through the
fog obliterating for a moment the
ghostly silhouettes of factory chim-
neys on the long island shore oppo-
site

  the dog was still howling col-
lins could see it now it was a
little bow-legged cocker spaniel it

sat shivering with cold at the wa-
ters edge its pointed nose lifted in
lugubrious complaint its long ears
hanging disconsolately its curly
black coat was soaked red tried to
drive the dog away but it came back
and resumed its howling red gave
up and joined the group of which
mayor mike was the center

  the group of shantytown deni-
zens was standing at the far side
of the abandoned brickyard almost
against the pilings of the short pier
they were looking at something un-
der the pier as collins came up
he saw what they were watching
the white flanks of a small boat
shone through the murk under the
pier the tide was just beginning
to ebb and the current of the river
forced back for four hours by the
salt flood from the sea was again as-
serting itself swirling eddies from
the conflicting currents were swing-
ing the boat around knocking it
against the black pilings it was a
twenty-foot launch with a small
cabin forward painted on the bow
in gleaming red letters was the
name laughing girl

  walrus his long mustache beaded
with fog waded into the river up to
his knees and seized a line at the
bow of the laughing girl he
tugged the launch slid slowly out
from under the pier the water lap-
ping against the bow as the nose
grounded phil collins was seized
with a cold feeling of nausea the
laughing girls cargo was not a
pretty sight

  in the cockpit of the launch a man
lay the mans face was a waxen
mask-a pallid mask of ineffectual
weakness frozen forever into a piti-
fully twisted silly smile there was
blood in the cockpit where the man
was lying the back of his head
had been blown neatly away

  go for the cops red said mayor

com- a

mike without taking his eyes from
the cockpit of the laughing girl

  the black cocker spaniel con-
tinued to howl

chapter iv

hartfords warning

a few seconds after the police-
man on the beat had tele-
phoned headquarters ambu-
lance bells were clanging and police
sirens were shrieking through the
early-morning calm of streets lead-
ing to the east river a crowd of
half-clad morbidly curious neigh-
bors flocked to shantytown three
dirty urchins lay on their stomachs
at the edge of the pier looking down
at the dead man in the launch the
inhabitants of shantytown itself
stood at the waters edge talking in
awed tones

  just as the scream of the police
sirens first became audible phil col-
lins who was standing at the back
of the group felt his elbow shaken
from behind he turned to look into
the drawn worried face of hand-
some hartford with a nod of his
head hartford motioned him aside
collins came

  you better get rid of that let-
ter said hartford in an under-
tone

what letter asked collins

  youve got a letter in your coat
pocket for a mrsharry daggett

  what of it

  tear it up burn it anything
but quick urged hartford the
dead man in the launch is harry
daggett

  collins looked blankly at hartford
for several seconds then he asked
was that young woman who ran
past here a minute ago-the one you
were calling isabel-was that mrs
daggett

  hartford nodded

 com- a

  whered she go

  never mind get rid of the let-
ter

  ill take it to mrs daggett said
collins i promised i would

  dont be a fool said hartford
you stay clear of this-

  but collins had already started
away with rapid strides

  passing mayor mikes shack col-
lins heard a baby crying he looked
in he saw a baby lying on the bed
but no one else was around he
passed the shack and headed toward
the hole in the rusty corrugated iron
fence that was the gate to east river
shantytown as he stepped through
the hole a green police car pulled
up at the curb a uniformed officer
and a corpulent bull-necked plain-
clothes man got out the plain-
clothes man grabbed collinss arm
as he passed

  whats the hurry he demanded

  going to get some breakfast
said collins

  later said the plain-clothes
man without releasing his hold on
collinss arm

  ive got a date said collins

  youve got a date with lieuten-
ant vincent hoag of the homicide
squad said the plain-clothes man
nobody leaves this place until ive
had a chance to talk to em all come
on

  he pushed collins back through
the hole in the fence

  other police cars were arriving
more policemen were piling out
two white-coated internes took a
stretcher out of an ambulance an
assistant medical examiner got out
of his auto carrying a black bag

  lieutenant hoag said to a uni-
formed policeman search this
man

  the policeman went through col-
linss pockets

  no gun he announced just


street  smiths complete stories

some employment agency slips and
a letter

 whats his name

 whats yer name mac

  phil collins

  give me the letter said lieuten-
ant hoag he put it into his own
pocket

 approaching the river hoag let
go of collinss arm but collins made
no effort to get away it was too
late now shantytown was swarm-
ing with blue uniforms there were
policemen everywhere on the pier
at the fence-pushing back the little
crowd near the launch keeping peo-
ple from leaving the confines of the
old brickyard

hoag and the medical exam-
iner were on the deck of the
laughing girl bending over
the corpse hoag raised his head

 whos head man of this bums
camp he asked of the little group
standing on the shore

 mayor mike stepped forward

 im what you might call the
guidin star o this self-respectin
colony o unemployed he said
what can i do for you

whats the dead mans name
mayor mike shook his head
even when live men come to
shantytown we never ask no
names he said so when theyre

dead when they come- he

shrugged

  well find out sooner or later who
he is said lieutenant hoag he
had been searching in vain for pa-
pers or signs of identification on the
body you may as well spill it
now

  he dont live here said mayor
mike

 never saw him before i sup-
pose	i

  never said mayor mike start-
ing to fill his corncob pipe

 of course said lieutenant
hoag the corpse just arrived
from europe in this here boat with
his head already blown half off so
theres no use asking any of you
bums if you ever saw the bird before

because-

  there was no word from the silent
group of shantytown residents phil
collins looked instinctively for
handsome hartford hartford was
nowhere to be seen

  that launch dont belong here
neither walrus volunteered i
never see no laughing girl tied up
to this pier in the ten months i been
living here

  seen it anywhere else though
asked lieutenant hoag

  i maybe seen it around the river
when i was working down at the
fulton markets admitted walrus
but i dont specially remember
about what time did the launch
come in to this pier asked the lieu-
tenant anybody hear the engine
i didnt hear no engine said
mayor mike

  neither did i said walrus
she probably drifted up from down-
town a ways the tide was runnin
in since midnight

  lieutenant hoag turned to the as-
sistant medical examiner

  how longs the man been dead
doc he asked

  about two hours came the re-
ply seems to have been killed by
a large-gauge shotgun i may be
able to tell you more after the au-
topsy

  any of you bums hear a shot at
three oclock this morning asked
lieutenant hoag looking at mayor
mike

  mayor mike glared back at the po-
lice lieutenant puffing furiously on
his pipe

 wasnt none he announced
id a heard it i sleep light
fog over the river



  the guy must a been shot before
the launch drifted up here volun-
teered walrus i didnt hear no
shot neither

  at this point three men pushed
their way through the crowd
two of them carried cam-
eras the third was a brash-looking
youngish man with baggy trousers
showing through the flapping front
of his raincoat and a shapeless felt
hat pushed back from his head at
an impudent angle

  hold it vincent called the
young man with the baggy trousers
as he jumped to the deck of the
laughing girl look intelligent
and maybe youll get your picture in
the daily tabloid action photo of
lieutenant hoag solving east river
murder whos the stiff vincent
jim north get the hell off this
boat ordered hoag swell chance
my finger-print manll have of find-
ing anything after a dumb newspa-
per reporters been tramping all over
the place with his muddy shoes
vincent you surprise me said
north even a policeman ought to
know that theres no prints to be
made off anything as wet as this
boat who found the body not a
pretty girl with photogenic legs
if youd keep your mouth shut
and your ears open north you
might find out something declared
hoag testily i aint finished ques-
tioning these bums yet

  hard to say just who did find
the body volunteered mayor mike
i guess i got here as soon as any-
body me and red got here about
the same time

  what called your attention to
it

  the dog howlin i guess said
mayor mike

 what dog

  a black spaniel he dont belong

in shantytown there he is settin
on the edge of the pier

  mayor mike pointed with the stem
of his pipe

  lieutenant hoag shouted to a uni-
formed policeman standing on the
pier

  catch that black dog obrien
as officer obrien started to obey
the dog scurried away from his grasp
with the speed of a scared rabbit
officer obrien in hot pursuit was
a poor second as the black cocker
spaniel streaked off the pier and
down the street its tail between its
legs long ears flapping

  itll probably come back said
hoag as he watched the dog and
policeman disappear if the dog
belongs to the dead man itll come
back when we move the body how
long had the dog been howling

  no one replied

  im talking to you with the red
hair said lieutenant hoag

  me said red i didnt hear
the pooch at first it was the lady
screaming that woke me up
what lady

  we aint sure it was a lady said
mayor mike quickly it might a
been most anybody a man

  or a seagull said the walrus

hoag called to an officer who
had been searching the huts
of shantytown

  find any signs of a woman living
in those shacks sergeant

  no women the sergeant called
back from the door of mayor mikes
shanty but theres a baby in here
the hell you say lieutenant
hoag exclaimed he stepped off
the laughing girl and walked
quickly up the river bank the
crowd followed him to mayor mikes
shanty the baby was lying on
mayor mikes bed very busy trying
to put his foot in his mouth it be-

stowed a two-tooth smile on the lieu-
tenant of the homicide squad

  whos kid is this demanded
hoag

  mine said mayor mike

 nerts said hoag looking
mayor mike up and down

  any reason why it couldnt be
said mayor mike with a hurt expres-
sion

  dont tell me youre the kids
mother too said hoag

  his mother ran away with a tight-
rope walker said mayor mike

  when was this asked the lieu-
tenant

  mayor mike rubbed the stubble on
his chin he might have been trying
to remember or he might have been
puzzling over the unfamiliar task
of trying to estimate a babys age

  about a year ago he ventured

  that kid aint more than six-
months old declared hoag

  i know said mayor mike she
ran away before the kid was born
brought him back to me in a basket

  left him on your doorstep i sup-
pose said hoag

  aint no doorstep to this house
replied mayor mike contemptu-
ously by the way red get some
canned heat outa that limousine pal-
ace o yours time to warm up the
babys milk

  make it snappy said lieutenant
hoag because im taking the red-
head to headquarters for question-
ing you too papa he said pok-
ing his finger into mayor mikes
stomach and that young squirt
that was trying to get away to keep
a date for breakfast whats your
name again

  collins came the reply from the
doorway

  youll come along too said
lieutenant hoag i want to talk
to you

  outside the white-coated internes

were carrying the corpse off the
laughing girl in a stretcher as
they crossed the abandoned brick-
yard the little black cocker spaniel
came back through the hole in the
fence sniffed at the stretcher
sniffed at the heels of the internes

  jim north police reporter for the
daily tabloid  stepping out of
mayor mikes shack paused in the
midst of lighting a cigarette to
watch the dog if he expected the
dog to follow the body of the mur-
dered man he was disappointed
while the stretcher bearers were
disappearing through the fence with
their gruesome burden the little
spaniel ran down to the waters edge
sprang aboard the laughing girl
ran to the cabin and curled up con-
tentedly on a leather cushion

  jim north finished lighting his
cigarette and snapped out the match
he went through the hole in the
fence and walked a block to a corner
grocery store that was just opening
for the day

  gimme a package of dog bis-
cuits he told the clerk quick

chapter v

finger prints cant lie

phil collins sat in lieuten-
ant hoags office at police
headquarters perspiring pro-
fusely for more than an hour the
two-hundred-pound police official
had been firing questions at him
without let-up the other men from
east river shantytown had been re-
leased after questioning but collins
had been detained hoag asked him
the same questions over and over al-
ways coming back to the same
points trying to pick a flaw in his
story there were homicidal phrases
in that letter addressed to mrs
harry daggett found in collinss
possession
fog over the river



 who is mrs harry daggett
hoag asked for the twentieth time

  i never saw her i told you said
collins i dont know

 then what were you doing with
this letter

  im supposed to deliver it to mrs
daggett but i dont know her
why didnt you deliver it then
i couldnt find her at that ad-
dress said collins i guess youve
found out by now that she isnt
there

  who wrote the letter demanded
hoag

  i dont know said collins truth-
fully

 you wrote it yourself said
hoag

 why dont you compare my hand-
writing suggested collins

 smart arent you said hoag
trying to make me believe you
dont know the letters typewritten
dont forget we got ways of tracing
typewriting

 why not compare my signature
then asked collins

  as if you didnt know the letter
wasnt signed

 collins mopped his brow he was
greatly relieved to learn that the let-
ter was typewritten and unsigned
he could go on keeping june lawns
name out of this business without
fear of being tripped up he wasnt
sure what sinister connection this
letter had with the murder of harry
daggett in an east river launch but
he felt he was doing the right thing
in protecting june lawn he might
be involving himself but that made
little difference since he was inno-
cent of any part in the proceedings
he was foolish perhaps in going
to such lengths on behalf of a girl
he hardly knew a girl with whom he
had had only one real conversation

  ive told you all i know said
collins

  what sort of a man was this bird
that gave you the letter to deliver
hoag came back to an old question

  i told you i didnt notice i think
he was kind of fat and wore glasses
this was a detail invented by col-
lins in his first effort to protect the
girl

  and how did he happen to pick
you for a messenger asked hoag
i dont notice you wearing a uni-
form

  i was standing in front of an em-
ployment agency in sith avenue
said collins sticking to his story
and this man asked me if i wanted
to earn a few cents he gave me a
dollar told me to take a taxi and
keep the change

  what did you do with the dol-
lar

  i used it to eat with

  but you didnt deliver the let-
ter

  i tried said collins and ill
try again after all i took the dol-
lar

  where did you say was the last
place you worked

  a delicatessen on east ninth
street near avenue c said collins
he had not mentioned the vandoria
apartments on account of pent-
house b

  lieutenant hoag took a typewrit-
ten letter and envelope out of a
drawer in his desk it was not the
original letter addressed to mrs
harry daggett-he was keeping the
original in order to be able to trace
the typewriter if the need developed
-but it was a copy he handed the
letter to collins

  all right collins he said
heres your letter go on out and
earn that dollar you spent

  collins put the letter into the en-
velope

  you mean i can go

  get out said hoag


street  smiths complete stories

  collins wasted no time when the
door closed behind him lieutenant
hoag pushed a buzzer a detective
came into the room

  burke said the lieutenant that
bird that just left here is phil col-
lins monday is waiting in the cor-
ridor to shadow him you might
saunter along to relieve monday if
anything comes up call me back
every hour

the detective left lieutenant
hoag picked up a sheaf of
papers-some finger-print
cards and a report from the identifi-
cation bureau a door slammed
lieutenant hoag looked up scowl-
ing profanity ready on his lips he
looked down again without swear-
ing jim north the daily tabloid
police reporter had just made his
usual unceremonious entrance

 well vincent said north
solved the shantytown murder
mystery yet

  have you growled hoag with-
out looking up he was always a
trifle annoyed by the brazen wise-
cracking north

  north had an uncanny knowledge
of the underworld and a remarkable
flare for the solution of crime he
took an unholy delight in outsleuth-
ing a police sleuth

  i warn you vincent said north
that the mystery will have to be
cleared up by the end of the week
thats an ultimatum

 unabashed by hoags ignoring
him he drew up a chair sat down
and planted his feet on the lieuten-
ants desk

 whose ultimatum demanded
hoag looking up at last

  mine said north- im going
on my vacation at the end of the
week taking it late this year and
i cant afford to run out on a front-
page mystery with nobody here to

solve it but you vincent any de-
velopments

 we identified the body said
lieutenant hoag its frank mon-
zello

 monzello you mean one of
those four fish market racketeers in-
dicted by the grand jury

  thats the man said hoag he
got out on bail last night and this
morning we find him dead

  it aint monzello said north
must be said hoag the iden-
tification bureau made finger prints
of the corpse up at the morgue
monzello was just printed here day
before yesterday and the card hadnt
even been filed yet the prints
tally

 must be some mistake said
north frowning

  cant be said hoag glad to con-
tradict the reporter the court
bailiff and the jailer who let mon-
zello out of the tombs last night
were up at the morgue too they
identified the body

 you ever seen monzello before
you saw the corpse asked north

 no admitted lieutenant hoag
monzello never gave us no trouble
he wasnt a big shot in the fish
market racket

  not very he wasnt said north
hes the brains of the racket hed
have owned the seafood whole-
salers mutual association in another
six months if the district attorney
hadnt decided to clean up fulton
street even so i bet he has a new
association going in a month or two
i talked to him once hes a bright
boy vincent

  i dont see it takes no brains to
shake down fish dealers protested
hoag all he has to do is tell them
to join the seafood wholesalers mu-
tual at so much per annum and those
that dont get kerosene poured over
their fish so they cant sell em
fog over the river



some get their teeth knocked out
anyhow monzellos dead

half a million a year isnt a bad
little racket vincent said north
and anyhow monzellos not dead
finger prints cant lie said
hoag

  all right you work on your
theory and ill work on mine said
north find out anything about
the laughing girl

  what dye think i been doing all
morning-sitting here blowing bub-
bles demanded hoag

  wheres the boat now

  down at the battery said hoag
tied up at the harbor police station
we traced her registry she belongs
to a fellow named arthur bendick
over on long island

  whos bendick asked north

  i got a man over on long island
now talking to him said the lieu-
tenant

  otherwise no clews

  just this said hoag hs opened
the deep bottom drawer of his desk
and produced a battered water-
soaked derby hat one of the boys
found it floating under the pier near
shantytown where we found the
laughing girl

n orth took the hat and be-
gan examining it

belong to the dead man

he asked

  too big said hoag thats
what the medical examiner says
the dead mans head wasnt in no
condition for a fitting

  north turned out the sweatband
there were no initials but some-
thing had been written on the under-
side of the leather with an indelible
pencil the water had made it into
an almost illegible purple blur
north squinted at it

  whats this he said looks
like a telephone number

  it is said hoag avenue
-

  which is what

  vandoria apartments pretty
swank place

  whats the connection

  none yet said lieutenant hoag
im working on that angle but i
dont think its hot some swell at
the vandoria probably threw the hat
away and some bum from east river
shantytown fished it out of an ash
can i dont think its a clew
dont try to think vincent said
north its not becoming to your
style of beauty

  as a matter of fact i dont think
shantytown is mixed in this murder
at all continued hoag ive
turned loose all the bums i brought
in from there still watching em
of course but my idea is that the
real digging is around the fulton
street fish markets i think its just
an accident that the body was found
in a boat off shantytown

  i dont said north the
laughing girl was anchored wasnt
she

  sure said the lieutenant un-
der the pier just a way to hide it
and delay discovery of the body
dont talk like a policeman vin-
cent said north if the murderer
wanted to hide the body hed have
dumped it overboard or opened the
seacock and sunk the launch with
the body in the cabin take it from
james that the laughing girl was
anchored off shantytown as an ex-
ample and a warning

  warning to whom asked hoag
thats to be seen replied north
if-

  lieutenant hoags telephone rang
he lifted the receiver

  hello    yes    yes
   the hell you say   well

bring him in and ill- what

   all right then ill come over

 hoag replaced the receiver and
stood up north took his heels from
the desk and stood up too

 well asked north

 long island said lieutenant
hoag something phony about this
man bendick that owns the laugh-
ing girl im going to talk to him

 so am i said north helping
himself to a cigar from a box on
hoags desk before he followed the
lieutenant from the room

chapter vi

the laughing girl

you ought to diet vincent
said jim north squeezed in
the back seat of a police car
between the beefy lieutenant and a
detective only a few pounds less cor-
pulent

  the car sped across the williams-
burg bridge snaked through the
drab forlorn streets which creep
back from the long island shore of
east river and finglly drew up at
the end of a blind alley in the fringes
of long island city

  across the end of the alley was a
wooden gate topped by a semicir-
cular sign which read

      arthur bendick
     ship chandler mechanic
     nets repaired
     i

  from the gate a path led down to
the river on one side of the path
was a boathouse on the other side
was a small cottage badly in need
of paint a sepia fish net was spread
along a little porch at the side of the
cottage red drums of gasoline were
piled against the boathouse

 lieutenant hoag jim north and
the detective got out of the police
car two men were waiting at the
gate one was obviously a plain-
clothes man the other was a man

in the early thirties wiry wearing
a greasy leather windbreaker his
face was tanned with high cheek
bones and a pointed jaw he stood
with his hands in his pockets watch-
ing with keen eyes as the newcomers
approached

  here he is lieutenant said the
plain-clothes man you take him
hes got me batty anyhow youll
want to look around the place

 the man in the leather wind-
breaker took one hand from his
pocket and extended it solemnly to
lieutenant hoag

  i am arthur bendick he said
in a high squeaky voice can i
offer you a small drink of applejack
it is good on a raw day like to-day

  no thanks said hoag he did
not shake hands with bendick but
walked past him down the path
then he stopped suddenly turned in
his tracks you own the launch
laughing girl

  bendick did not reply at once he
was busy tamping tobacco into an
old pipe

  sure i own the laughing girl
he said at last

  did you use it last night de-
manded lieutenant hoag

  no said bendick

 who had your launch between
midnight and five this morning the
lieutenant asked

 nobody squeaked bendick
she was right here all the time

  lieutenant hoag smiled incredu-
lously

 happen to know where the
laughing girl is now he inquired

  sure shes right in the boat-
house where shes been for two
days

  hoags incredulous smile broke
into a laugh

  like hell she is he exclaimed
shes down at the battery in cus-
tody of the harbor police
fog over the river



  bendick shook his head

  no he said solemnly shes
here come on i show you

bendick led the way to the
end of the path and turned
into the little boathouse
there resting on the gently inclined
rails on which it had been slid up
from the water was a craft that to all
appearances was the one in which
the body of a murdered man had
been found off shantytown that
morning it was a twenty-foot
launch with a small cabin forward
across its square stern and along
its white flanks near the bow gleam-
ing red letters proclaimed laugh-
ing girl

  lieutenant hoag blinked he
turned to jim north

  am i cockeyed he demanded
or-

  probably vincent said north
but id call the harbor police any-
how

  i hauled her up outa the water
day before yesterday bendick was
explaining shrilly rudder been
acting funny long as i had her out
i thought id touch up a few spots
with red lead and-

  got a phone in there bendick
interrupted lieutenant hoag

  phone sure said bendick in
the house i show you

  he led the way into the cottage
a peculiar frowzy smell in which
were blended the odors of creosote
and stale bacon grease permeated
the dark interior of the house while
hoag was telephoning jim north
poked around among the jumbled
coils of rope anchors red and green
running lights and other nautical
impedimenta which lay about in dis-
orderly profusion

  this is hoag homicide squad
said the lieutenant into the tele-
phone wheres the laughing girl

   yes i know you had her
tied up but that was a couple of
hours ago have another look will
you    what    maybe
she cant run off by herself but-the
engines out of commission well
will you take a look anyhow as a
special favor there was a pause
then hello   she is eh
   all right thanks

  hoag hung up and turned puzzled
eyes on jim north

  the laughing girl is still at the
battery he said

  no no protested bendick in his
high voice shes been in the boat-
house since day before yesterday

when-

  all right all right broke in
hoag is there another launch
called laughing girl in new york
harbor

  bendick smoked solemnly for a
moment then he shook his head

never saw her if there is he
said is there another registered

tered is owned by arthur bendick
thats me squeaked bendick

  hoag said nothing during the first
part of the journey home not until
the police car was moving up the
long approach to the williamsburg
bridge bound for manhattan did he
break his puzzled silence

  north he asked what the hell

chapter vii

penthouse b

phil collins knew he was
being followed he had no
illusions about being so read-
ily released by the police he was
not particularly bothered on his own
account since he had nothing to
hide he did however want to see
june lawn and report to her the
events of the past forty-eight hours
she would certainly want to know
what had happened since the note
she had given him to deliver had ex-
pressed very definite ideas on rid-
ding the world of harry daggett-
ideas which some one had evidently
carried out if handsome hartford
was telling the truth when he said
that the dead man in the launch was
daggett thus collins was faced
with the problem of losing his shad-
owers before reporting to penthouse
b he felt that it wouldnt be ad-
visable to lead the police back to the
vandoria

  after leaving police headquarters
collins went back to mrs harry
daggetts address in east thirteenth
street he knew she would not be
there but it seemed the proper thing
to do in view of his story to lieu-
tenant hoag after that he went
to shantytown

 two uniformed policemen were
sauntering about shantytown now
watching spig stir the community
fish chowder in mayor mikes
shack there was a conference of
fog over the river



shantytown elders over methods of
making the baby stop crying the
infant was lying on mayor mikes
bed giving shrill full-lunged ex-
pression to its unhappiness

  didja feel was there any pins
stickin him asked walrus strok-
ing his mustache

  nothin wrong with him but hes
hungry diagnosed mayor mike
with an air of authority you gents
didnt feed him like i said while i
was out with the cops warm up the
milk red

  aint no room on the stove pro-
tested red spigs cookin chow-
der

  you go get that canned heat or-
dered mayor mike a couple
drinks less aint goin to hurt you
when its gone ill appropriate
some money outa that ten bucks
handsome hartford left with me to
get some more

  where is handsome anyhow
asked phil collins

  gone on a business trip said
mayor mike hell be back

  the brats just yellin for its
ma suggested slats right idea
too cant expect a bunch of men to

play nursemaid to-

  were goin to take care o this
kid till his ma comes back to get
him said mayor mike thats set-
tled you go ahead makin that
cracker box into a cradle like i told
you slats

  phil collins went out again it
was getting dark he saw the man
he recognized as the detective as-
signed to trail him loitering on the
pier he ate some of spigs fish
chowder and some stale bread then
he started off for the vandoria as
he went through the hole in the
fence he saw the man on the pier
turn and saunter quite casually after
him

  collins walked rapidly westward

across town he knew without look-
ing behind him that he was being
followed he had an idea for shak-
ing off the shadow it would cost
him one-third of his entire capital-
which was now fifteen cents

 he went down the steps of the
east side subway station in astor
place and dropped one of his three
nickels in the turnstile he took an
uptown local and noted that the de-
tective took the same train one car
to the rear the detective stood on
the platform so that he could look
into collinss car

 ifet grand central most of the
a  passengers in the local got
l out a crowd stood about
the doors struggling to get in be-
fore the doorways were quite clear
of outgoing passengers an ex-
press roared into the station more
passengers crossed the platform to
change to the local when the con-
fusion was at its height collins sud-
denly left his seat darted to the
door tried half-heartedly to press
through the charging phalanx of
incoming passengers out of the
corner of his eye he saw the detec-
tive come to life in the next car and
step off the train watching collins
allowed himself to be pushed back
into the car by the shuffling shoving
crowd the car doors slid closed
the detective strolled by on the
platform with a professional look of
unconcern which did not conceal the
fact that he was searching the sub-
way crowds for his man collins
stepped behind a stout woman with
her arms full of bundles the up-
town local moved out of the station
collins had very successfully lost
his shadow

  at the next station he got off he
bounded up the cement stairway to
the street he looked about him on
the chance that by some miracle the


street  smiths complete stories

detective had managed to comman-
deer surface transportation which
would beat the subway to the sta-
tion there was no one in sight
he was free he walked rapidly
down the block and turned in to a
drug store he stepped into a tele-
phone booth and dropped his next-
to-last nickel into the instrument
he called avenue - he held
his breath as he listened to the buz-
zing sound of the operator trying to
complete the call

  vandoria apartments

  collins did not recognize the
mans voice it must be the new
man the man who had taken his
place

  penthouse b please he said

  sorry no one in penthouse b
said the voice

  but mr wight must be there
said collins hes expecting my
call

  mr wight went out about ten
minutes ago said the voice

  collins smiled into the mouth-
piece here was a piece of welcome
information and a lucky break

  then ill speak to miss lawn
said collins

  sorry replied the voice mr
wight asked that no calls be put
through to penthouse b during his
absence said the man at the switch-
board

  collins hung up he went to the
entrance of the drug store and
looked in both directions there
were two women walking up from
the subway station no one else in
sight collins started for the van-
doria

  as he walked along the street he
wondered if he should walk boldly
into the lobby taking a chance that
the man on duty at the switchboard
and elevator was new and would not
recognize him if wight had left
word that no telephone calls were

to be put through to penthouse b
however it was certain that no visi-
tors were to be taken up in the ele-
vator collins would have to walk
the seventeen flights of stairs as
he came to the vandorias marquee
extending out oyer the sidewalk
collins slowed his steps hesitated
then turned and strolled into the
familiar lobby

  the man at the switchboard had
his back turned as collins came
in he faced about he was a new
man

  ive got a message for reed
apartment -f said collins he
remembered the names of the ten-
ants

  the new operator looked at col-
lins disdainfully then nodded to-
ward the stairway

  second floor right he said
walk it

collins wanted nothing bet-
ter he went up the steps
two at a time passing the sec-
ond floor then the third fourth
fifth at the sixth floor he slackened
his pace he had a long climb ahead
of him by the fifteenth he was well
winded and weak at the knees as
he paused for breath he heard the
elevator mounting from below
climbing another half flight he
stopped on the mid-floor landing
out of sight of the corridor he lis-
tened

  the elevator continued to mount
closer higher the car was even
with him passed him was it wil-
liam wight returning already to
penthouse b the elevator climbed
another floor stopped at seventeen
the doors opened and closed the
elevator started down again col-
lins drew a deep breath and resumed
his climb a moment later he was
knocking on the door of mysterious
penthouse b
fog over the river



 there was no response to his
knock he knocked again repeat-
edly still no response he thought
he heard some one moving inside
however he put his lips close to
the door and called miss lawn
who is it replied a girls voice
this is phil collins ive some-
thing important to tell you

  i cant see you said the girl
through the door im locked in
locked in

  mr wight locked the door on the
outside when he went out

  ill see you on the terrace in
three minutes then said collins
promptly

  dont make any noise said the
girls voice dont wake up the
housekeeper

  collins went to the end of the
short corridor and opened a door
into a closet inside the closet was
a ladder that led to the water tanks
on the common roof of the two pent-
houses he climbed the ladder
opened an overhead trapdoor and
emerged on the roof he gasped as
the cold night wind struck him full
in the face

  he tiptoed across the roof of pent-
house b between the shadowy tow-
ers of other apartment houses he
could see even rows of street lamps
far below ahead was central park
with luminous serpents of automo-
bile lights crawling along the wind-
ing roads he slid over the edge of
the roof and let himself down to the
broad terrace among wicker furni-
ture in a sky garden of potted plants
he did not see june lawn at first
there was no light but a rosy glow
filtering through heavily draped
french windows then he caught
sight of her sitting in a deep arm-
chair between two bay trees she
did not get up he stood a minute
looking at her in the half darkness
wondering how to begin

 youre two days late she said
 late

 why didnt you come when you
 got my telegram

 i didnt get it said collins
 where did you send it

 the girl laughed-half in embar-
 rassment

 i got your address from the su-
 perintendent she said

 collinss answering laugh was a
 little bitter

 i dont live there any more he
 said ive been evicted

then how did you happen to

 come here if you didnt-

 i wanted to tell you that i could
 not deliver the note you gave me
 said collins and that-well there
 has been trouble but i guess you
 have heard

 the girl stood up

whats happened she asked
quickly i havent heard whats
happened to isabel

 as far as i know nothins hap-
 pened to mrs daggett said collins
 but i guess you get your wish
 about her husband

what wish are you talking
about

 didnt you wish that the world
 could be rid of harry daggett
 asked collins

 there was a moment of icy si-
 lence then june lawn said slowly
 in cold hurt tones

 i thought i could trust you i
 suppose it serves me right for rely-
 ing on my instincts i didnt really
 think you would open a letter con-
 fided to you for private delivery

when-

 i didnt collins broke in the
 police opened it and read it to me
 the police

harry daggett was murdered
sometime last night his body was
found in a launch anchored off east
river shantytown


street  smiths complete stories

june lawn dropped into her
chair there was another pause
then she said in a low voice

  i really dont know what to say-
what my own feelings are i cant
sincerely say im sorry because
harry daggett was of no use to any
one-not even himself still when a
person i know dies-even a worth-
less person-it does something to
me makes me feel very small very
unimportant who-how was he
murdered

  collins shook his head

  all i know is that the back of his
head was blown off he said they
have had me at police headquarters
most of the day trying to find some
connection between your letter that
they found on me and the murder
of course they dont know that the
letter came from you i dont think
theyve identified the body as harry
daggetts either or the police would
have locked me up

  im sorry said the girl i didnt
want you to get involved in anything
like this i expected to tell you
something about that letter the other
night but mr wight came out and
stopped me then when isabel
telephoned me next day i was fran-
tic i was afraid you might walk
blindly into some terrible situation
on my account i wanted to warn
you when i heard that mr wight
was going to be gone between ten
and eleven i managed to send you a
telegram

  is mrs daggett some relation of
yours

  shes my sister

  and what relation is william
wight

  no relation replied the girl
hes my boss thats all im just
his stenographer

  is it usual for a stenographer to
be living in her bosss penthouse
asked collins

  theres nothing usual about mr
wight said the girl the whole
situation is very unusual and very
mysterious particularly the last
few days ive been wishing for
some way to get out of it im afraid
its too late now

  how did you get in in the first
place

  i answered an advertisement in
the newspapers said june lawn
it was about six months ago id
just come to new york to be with
isabel when her baby was born you
see isabel and i used to live to-
gether in a little town in indiana
isabel was always a strange girl-a
little naive a little foolish perhaps
with a genius for collecting pecu-
liar friends i told her not to marry
harry daggett but there was no
stopping her harry was as good-
looking as he was stupid and weak
he took her to new york they
were on the verge of starvation a
year later when i came on after

them and a little bewildered-

  so you helped feed them asked
collins

  the girl nodded

  i got this job with mr wight
which paid quite well id been
working for him several months
when he asked me to come to live
in the penthouse it would be quite
proper he said since the house-
keeper also lived here it was just
that his business hours were irregu-
lar he was apt to be getting long-
distance phone calls late at night for
instance and he wanted his secre-
tary to be on hand for emergencies
what is his business anyhow

  i-im not sure said june lawn
he owns several loft buildings in
greene street-that i know and
he has customers calling or writing
in for goods i dont know what
kind of goods the letters he dic-
tates are very vague so many par-
fog over the river



cels of grade a or grade b of such-
and-such size ive never dared ask
him hes been very good-

  in what way

  well when he found out i was
helping my sister and her baby be-
cause harry daggett was earning al-
most no money-and what little he
did earn i suspect was not quite hon-
est-he took harrys address and got
a job for him the next thing i
knew harry was in jail after that
mr wight wouldnt have anything
to do with him and even refused to
let me see my sister any more that
was the reason i wanted you to
smuggle that note to her the other
night i asked you to give it to her
alone because there was money in
it

  there was no money in it said
collins i saw the police open it
i didnt see any money

  im sure i put a ten-dollar bill
in the envelope said june lawn
anyhow i was afraid that if harry
daggett knew about the money it
wouldnt do the baby any good
harry got a few hundred dollars out
of the job that mr wight arranged
for him and he spent it all in a week
he bought a case of champagne be-
cause hed always heard about it and
never tasted any he bought a gold
watch-

  what was he in jail for asked
collins

  i dont know said the girl
even isabel wasnt sure shes
never interested in practical details
of that sort all i know is that isa-
bel called up again the morning after
i gave you the letter for her to say
that harry had been arrested again
mr wight overheard me talking on
the phone he was furious since
hed told me to have nothing more to
do with her thats when he gave
orders for no more phone calls to be
put through except when hes here

and when hes not here im a pris-
oner he locks the doors-

  and you stand for it

  i dont know what to do i dont
know any one in new york

  you know me said collins ill
admit that at this moment im not
much better than nothing but im
going to help you get out of here
ive got a hunch that old man wight
knows something about the murder
of harry daggett

  hes been like a crazy man these
last few days said the girl he
acts as if he were afraid of some-
thing i dont dare to breathe ex-
cept when hes away-and that isnt
often

  when will he come back to-
night asked collins

  he didnt say

  listen said collins stepping
closer to her if anything should
happen you can find me in shanty-
town over on the east river your
sisters babys there

  for heavens sake the girl
stood up whos taking care of the
baby

  do you know a man named hart-
ford asked collins

  charlie hartford another one
of isabels strange friends hes
from our home town he wanted to
marry isabel for years at that he
would have been better than harry
daggett anything-any one would

be better than-

  the girl stopped abruptly col-
lins saw a look of terror come into
her eyes he followed her gaze a
shadow had blotted out the rosy
glow filtering through the draped
french windows leading to the ter-
race

  hes come back whispered june
lavn hes-

  phil collins stepped behind the
trim row of potted bay trees

  the french windows were flung


street  smiths complete stories

suddenly open light streamed out
upon the terrace from the drawing-
room of the penthouse

chapter viii

the trembling hand

the hulking form of william
wight loomed in the door-
way the light shining from
behind him made a luminous horned
crown of his shaggy snowy mane
leaving his face a dark blur his
hands were in his pockets

 june lawn took a step toward
him

  good evening mr wight her
voice was thin and unsteady

  you were talking to some one
boomed wight

  i was singing to myself said
the girl i came out to look at the
stars i was feeling happy-

  you were talking to some one
repeated wight in his commanding
bass i heard a mans voice where
is he

  you must have been mistaken
mr wight i-

  the girl stopped wight with-
drew one hand from his pocket
light flashed on metal

  the girl took a step backward
she was standing between wight
and the trees that hid collins

  collins looked back over his shoul-
der he was only a few feet from
the parapet of the penthouse terrace
a few feet from a sheer drop of
eighteen stories the fire escape
was at the other side of the terrace
wight stood between him and the
fire escape between him and the
penthouse roof and the trapdoor to
the corridor between him and the
french windows leading to the in-
terior of the penthouse he was cor-
nered

  the doors were locked boomed
wight anybody who came in dur-

ing my absence is an intruder i
have a perfect right to shoot a bur-
glar in defense of my home

  put that gun away mr wight
said june lawn her voice was calm
again and several tones lower

  wight lunged forward took her
arm in his powerful grasp flung her
toward the french windows

  get in there he ordered tele-
phone for the police

  collins watched through the leafy
screen of bay trees he saw the girl
stumble and recover herself in the
doorway he saw her hesitate he
saw the pistol gleaming in wights
fist then he noticed that the pistol
hand was trembling

  he stepped out suddenly from be-
hind the trees

evening mr wight he said
wight did not move the pistol
in his hand shifted a fraction of an
inch to bear upon collins the hand
still shook

  what are you doing here de-
manded wight

  collins leaned forward to rest his
hands on the back of a wicker chair
how much could he count on an un-
steady hand at such close range

  i came to see you about a job mr
wight he said

  youve got no business here
barked wight youre an intruder
the law gives a man the right to kill
an intruder in his home

  since you had me fired from the
vandoria mr wight continued
collins in the same quiet vein i
thought that perhaps you might
square matters by getting me an-
other job-like the one you got for
harry daggett

  a roaring blast of flame spurted
briefly from wights gun a spray
of bay leaves clipped by the bullet
stung collinss face his hands
closed on the wicker chair whisked
it from the floor swung it

com- a
fog over the river



  he heard wights gun skating
across the concrete floor of the ter-
race wight fell back under the im-
pact of the chair

  collins dropped the chair sprang
across the terrace and jumped for
the eaves he pulled himself up
started running across the penthouse
roof toward the water tanks when
he reached the trapdoor that led
down into the corridor of the
eighteenth floor he dropped to his
knees and groped for the ring in
the trapdoor he found the ring
tugged the door stuck he got to
his feet tugged again harder des-
perately no use the door did not
yield some ctae had hooked it from
below

collins made his way back
toward the edge of the roof
he might go across to the
other side drop to the terrace of
penthouse a and go down the fire
escape on that side of the building
he had a feeling of guilt however
at abandoning june lawn logi-
cally he knew he would be in a far
better position to help her if he got
away from the vandoria and main-
tained his freedom long enough to
clear up something of the mystery
of william wight who had tried to
shoot him at the mention of the name
of the murdered harry daggett
yet the thought that the girl was
in danger drew him toward the ter-
race of penthouse b he paused at
the edge of the roof the cold wind
in his face he had a moment of diz-
ziness as he caught sight of people
walking in the street far below
then he heard snatches of conver-
sation he heard june lawns voice
raised in excited protest he heard
another woman-the housekeeper
probably-saying something he
heard william wights impressive
bass command the housekeeper

 com- a

  give her a sedative mrs grant
hypodermic if its necessary a
prowler broke into the apartment
and frightened her into hysterics
ive sent for the police

  collins dropped over the edge of
the roof to the terrace belonging to
penthouse b

 a complaining cry from june
lawn was cut short by the slamming
of a door

  collins was groping over the con-
crete floor of the terrace he found
the gun that he had knocked from
wights hand he marched through
the open french windows into an at-
mosphere of thick rugs and shaded
lamps william wight had just
taken a telephone receiver off the
hook

  put that down ordered collins

  wight turned his condescending
gaze on collins noted the gun in his
hand but made no move to comply

  put up your hands collins or-
dered

  slowly with insolent deliberation
wight obeyed

  now tell your housekeeper to
bring miss lawn in here said col-
lins

  wights bushy eyebrows raised a
trifle in disdain he shook his head
in the negative

  do as i say ordered collins

  why asked wight with simu-
lated boredom

  ive got a perfect argument in
my right hand

  you wouldnt shoot me said
wight ive phoned for the police
theyll be here at any minute
youd be arrested for murder

  collins crossed the room closer to
wight closer to the foyer and the
door that opened into the corridor
opposite the elevator

  my arrest wouldnt bring you
back to life said collins

 wight yawned he lowered one


street  smiths complete stories

hand to cover his mouth politely
as he did so collins realized that
wights great show of unconcern
was acting-and not very good act-
ing either the mans face was
ashen and the hand trembled in
front of his mouth he was going
through with his bluff however

  then shoot said wight

  collins hesitated he brought his
gun hand slightly away from his
body as if preparing to fire-though
he knew he would not press the trig-
ger his gaze met wights piercing
eyes

  a door opened behind him

  wight dropped his hands stood
up

 collins whirled he caught a
glimpse of a dark uniform felt a
stunning blow on his head he had
a second of aching blindness but he
kept his feet he found himself
grappling with the man in uniform-
the new elevator operator over his
shoulder through the open door he
saw the elevator standing at the
eighteenth floor

  collins squirmed from the clinch
aimed a straight left at the eleva-
tor mans head the man ducked
clinched again forced collins
against the wall he saw wight
rushing toward him swinging a bot-
tle

 with his elbows collins made
space for infighting then uncoiled
a short upward jab the elevator
mans head snapped back his hold
relaxed collins pushed him into
the charging wight turned fled
through the open door crossed the
corridor stepped into the waiting
elevator

  collins touched the control lever
slid the doors closed

  as the car started to drop he had
a momentary feeling of relief then
new doubts seized him his escape
was by no means final wight had

phoned for the police he had an
even chance of stepping out of the
elevator on the ground floor into the
arms of an officer of the radio patrol
sent to the vandoria by wireless in-
structions from headquarters even
if the police had not yet arrived
there was the superintendent wight
had only to pick up his telephone
to warn the superintendent that col-
lins was in the elevator the car
flashed downward past floor after
floor

  collins pulled back the control
lever the elevator stopped at the
seventh floor he left it standing
there with the doors open and ran
down the corridor there was a
window at the end of the corridor
collins opened it and stepped out on
the platform of a fire escape he
looked down the crisscrossing
iron stairway faded in darkness

  collins started climbing down

chapter ix

finger prints do lie

jim north told lieutenant
hoag that he was going back to
the daily tabloid office but he
didnt go north almost never went
near his office except on pay days
he was not one of these word-paint-
ing reporters with literary ambitions
and daily by-lines over palpitating
descriptions of how the victims
mother wept in court norths job
was to dig up facts he wrote by
telephone he let the rewrite desk
in the office worry about adjectives
and split infinitives

  when north got out of hoags car
after the return from bendicks boat-
house on long island he hailed a
taxi and drove to center street po-
lice headquarters by a roundabout
route then he went directly to the
identification bureau hoping that he
would get there before hoag hoag
fog over the river



of course would find out eventually
what north was after but the re-
porter couldnt resist the chance to
score a beat not only for the tabloid
over the other newspapers who
would get their information from of-
ficial sources but over the lieuten-
ant himself there was that box
of cigars to think of

 north walked into the bureau
tossing greetings left and right he
knew the whole personnel of the
bureau from photographers to fin-
ger-print experts they looked on
north as almost a member of the
force

 north walked between row after
row of filing cabinets containing the
finger prints of hundreds of thou-
sands of criminals so ingeniously
catalogued that the telegraphing of
a classification-a number in the
form of a fraction-from paris or
peru or peoria would enable the
staff to determine in a few seconds
whether the man in question was
known to the new york police

  north stopped in front of the desk
of the official he was seeking

 howdy hewett said north
did lieutenant hoag ask for a
check on the record of a man named
arthur bendick

 he did said hewett putting
down a magnifying glass but he
hasnt sent in for it yet

  but bendick has a record
sure said hewett assault
and battery beat up some guy down
at the fulton street fish markets
about six weeks ago got thirty
days for it

  fine said north you printed
him of course

  sure said hewett

lets see the card said north
hewett fished among some papers
in a wire basket and drew out the
finger-print classification card of ar-
thur bendick north studied it a

moment a frown creased his fore-
head as he looked at the two rows
of black smudges and the pawlike
print of the whole hand below he
glanced at the classification fraction
at the top of the card and broke into
a broad grin

hewett he asked have you
filed the prints of frank monzello
the fish-market racketeer yet
the one that was murdered
the one that hoag says was mur-
dered

  he was just indicted a couple of
days ago said hewett the boys
here are about a week behind in their
filing

 and now that hoag says hes
dead you probably wont ever file
monzellos prints

  maybe not were crowded for
space

  north burst into a loud guffaw
then youll never know about
the miracle hewett unless i tell
you said north still laughing

  what the hell you laughing at
north demanded hewett

  in all the thousands of finger
prints youve handled said north
his laughter subsiding briefly did
you ever see two alike

  impossible said hewett no
two prints are ever alike

  thats the miracle said north
if youd filed frank monzellos
prints youd have found them iden-
tical with arthur bendicks here
thats no miracle said hewett
it would just mean that monzello
and bendick were the same man
but theyre not the same man
said north the prints youve iden-
tified with monzello tally with the
ones you made from the fingers of
the dead man in the morgue to-day-
right

  wait a minute said the finger-
print expert he left his desk and
came back a moment later with a


street  smiths complete stories

card which he compared with the
card of prints labeled arthur ben-
dick

  youre right he said whorl
for whorl and loop for loop theyre
the same as i said that can mean
only one thing-that monzello and
bendick are the same person

  but theyre not insisted north
bendick is alive i talked to him
an hour ago whats more im con-
vinced that the dead man isnt mon-
zello

  then-what the hell hewett
frowned and examined the finger
prints through his magnifying glass
i dont get you north

  youre not supposed to hewett
said the reporter the business of
crime detection by deduction and
other forms of cerebration is not the
job of the identification bureau for
some quaint reason it has been al-
lotted to the homicide squad and
im going over to see hoag right
now by the way ill take over ar-
thur bendicks card to him if you
want

  o k said hewett

jim north slipped the record
into his pocket and left the iden-
tification bureau he did not go
to lieutenant hoags office however
he had no intention of letting hoag
in on his discovery until he had done
a little research on his own account
hoag would be hopping mad of
course when he found out norths
tactics he would threaten north
with prosecution for obstruction of
justice and interference with the
functions of the police he had
threatened both before but the
prosecutions had never materialized
after all north was not actually ob-
structing justice he was furthering
it in his own way hoag knew that
the reporter was a valuable aid in
the end whatever his annoying

tricks during the course of an in-
vestigation and north always gave
hoag credit in print for crime solu-
tions that the reporter had worked
out himself

  instead of going to hoags of-
fice north went to the criminal
courts building it was late in the
afternoon none of the courts were
in session and most of the court
clerks and bailiffs had gone home
however north found an attendant
who could give him access to the
court records north spent half an
hour poring over the deposition of
cases tried six weeks previous before
he came to the page devoted to the
people vs arthur bendick it
seemed that bendick had been ar-
rested on a charge of assault and bat-
tery and admitted to bail almost im-
mediately the required two thou-
sand five hundred dollars for his pro-
visional freedom was furnished by
one louis rustaff a bail-bond
broker twenty-four hours later
bendick had entered a plea of guilty
as charged so that there were no
witnesses called and no testimony
taken bendick had been sentenced
to thirty days in prison and had been
committed at once the record
showed

  north jotted down a few notes and
went out he took a taxi and headed
back across east river for that part
of long island in which arthur ben-
dick kept his launch the laughing
girl he wanted to find out the
truth of the possibility that the mur-
dered man in the morgue might actu-
ally be arthur bendick and that
the man lieutenant hoag had ques-
tioned that afternoon was an impos-
tor he was still sure that neither
man was frank monzello

  north did not go directly to ben-
dicks boathouse but had the taxi
turn down the street before he got
to bendicks blind alley he would
fog over the river



question the neighbors he found
an old man with chin whiskers who
raised rabbits in his back yard

  sure i know bendick said the
old man in reply to norths ques-
tion known him for nigh on to
two years

  seen him recently asked north
saw him this afternoon said the
old man saw him talking to a lot
of policemen

  the fellow with the leather
jacket and a high squeaky voice-is
that bendick

thats him said the old man
north nodded and mentally
crossed off one possibility evi-
dently the murdered man was not
bendick

  has bendick been away much in
the last few months do you know
he asked

  the old man stroked his chin
whiskers

  not that i recollect he said pen-
sively he goes away for a day or
two at a time in that launch of his
but he dont stay long

  wasnt he away for a month-
about six weeks ago

  gosh no said the old man i
been seeing him about twice a week
regular for the last two months
had to complain a lot about that dog
of his worrying my rabbits

  i didnt know bendick had a
dog said north i thought he
kept a cat

  he may call it a cat said the old
man but it sure looks like a dog
to me barks like a dog too

  is it a cocker spaniel asked
north

  maybe if you say so said the
old man all i know is i always
thought it was a dog a little black
dog with long ears bad on rab-
bits it is

  thanks said north

  he took leave of the man with

chin whiskers got back into his taxi
and ordered the driver to return to
manhattan the trail now led very
clearly to louis rustaff bail-bond
broker

chapter x

cigars for north

norths taxi raced through
the busy thoroughfares of
manhattan until it reached a
little street adjacent to courts and
prison both sides of the street were
lined with offices of pety lawyers
and bail-bond brokers in which
paunchy men sat behind plate-glass
windows on day-and-night vigil
eagerly waiting like birds of prey
to profit by the troubles of some un-
fortunate who had run afoul of the
law north crossed the sidewalk to
a big window on which the name
louis rustaff was emblazoned in
gold block letters he knew rustaff
slightly by reputation which was
about as good-or as bad-as the gen-
eral run of bail-bond brokers who
for a consideration only slightly
more than the law allows will post
money with any court to allow an ac-
cused man provisional freedom

  north walked into the office he
saw rustaff sitting with his feet on
his desk cigar smoke arose from
behind a newspaper when north
approached rustaff put his paper
down but kept his feet on the desk
he wore a derby hat pushed back
from his round flabby face a heavy
gold watch chain crossed his ample
stomach

  what can i do for you asked
rustaff waggling his cigar to the
left corner of his mouth

  i came to ask about a client of
yours said north making himself
at home on the edge of rustaffs
desk a man named arthur ben-
dick

  rustaff suddenly deposited his


street  smiths complete stories

feet on the floor with the grace of a
performing elephant he stared at
north through tiny eyes that were
almost hidden in rolls of fat

 who are you he demanded
through clouds of cigar smoke

  im jim north was the reply
otherwise known as sister susie of
the household hints department of
that fine old family journal the
daily tabloid

  dont know you said rustaff

  you will said north quite
well probably i have an idea rus-
taff that we may see quite a lot of
each other during these crisp au-
tumn days where did you get that
hat

  north leaned forward and uncere-
moniously plucked the derby from
rustaffs head exposing a pate quite
bald except for a dozen long black
hairs carefully combed across the
top of the glistening scalp

  hey dont get familiar with that
doiby said rustaff making a grab
for his hat its a ten-dollar kelly

  north was looking at the inside
of the hat the manufacturers
trade-mark was still bright in its
gilt stamp and the leather sweat-
band was undarkened by perspira-
tion

  new isnt it commented north
you didnt lose your old one in the
east river by any possible chance
he turned the band out and there
doesnt seem to be any phone num-
bers written in this one

  hey whats the idear com-
plained rustaff finally snatching his
hat back and clamping it on his head
what do you want in here any-
how

  information about your client ar-
thur bendick said north

  no client of mine by that name
said rustaff shifting his cigar to the
right side

  sorry to contradict you said

north but court records show that
you put up a bond of two thousand
five hundred dollars for arthur ben-
dick six weeks ago

  oh bendick i remember now
i thought you said bennett thats
why i didnt remember what about
bendick

  there was a man found murdered
in a launch on the east river this
morning said north whose finger
prints correspond to those on file
for arthur bendick

 no rustaff made clucking
sounds with his tongue to denote
surprise and grief thats too bad
so he got in trouble again did he
the funny part of it is north
continued that bendick is alive
and well and carrying on business at
his old long island stand what do
you make of that rustaff

  you dont say rustaff spread
his pudgy hands in a gesture of com-
plete astonishment you can soich
me mr north i dont understand
it maybe theres some mistake

north leaned forward until
his face was quite close to
rustaffs he looked the
broker straight in the eyes

  rustaff he said who was it
went to jail under the name of ar-
thur bendick for assault and battery
six weeks ago

  listen mr north said rustaff
all i know about bendick is that
he got pinched for beating up a guy
over in the fulton street fish
markets and he sent for me to put
up bail for him when he pleaded
guilty and went to jail i got my
bond back thats all i know about
him

  funny youd risk two thousand
five hundred dollars on a man you
dont know any more about than
that said north

  he put up his launch for secur-
fog over the river



ity said rustaff it wasnt much
of a risk

  not as big a risk as frank mon-
zello

  what about monzello

  you put up bond to get him out
last night didnt you-just before he
was murdered-or at least the man
who was posing as monzello was
murdered

  who me i did like hell rus-
taff was emphatic you dont catch
me putting up twenty grand in a case
like that

  you seem to know what bail was
set was norths comment

  sure i know said rustaff he
wanted me to put up bond for him
just like he wanted all the other
brokers in this street to put it up
i wouldnt take a chance on any of
those fulton street boids who did
put up the bond anyhow

  thats what i want to know
said north somebody sent around
twenty thousand in currency to get
monzello-or the bird who posed as
monzello-out of jail it was worth
twenty thousand cash to somebody
to have monzello out where they
could get at him

  honest mr north it wasnt me
i swear it rustaff raised his fat
right hand solemnly north noticed
that the palm was damp with nervous
perspiration i havent got twenty
grand in cash to my name honest
but you know who did put up the
twenty grand

  mr north do you think id lie
to you

  yes said north promptly and
with a good deal of pleasure more-
over i think you know the name of
this man who served as ringer for
both bendick and monzello and i
think you know why he was mur-
dered last night how about it
youre all wrong mr north
o k rustaff north slid off

the desk took a card from his pocket
and scribbled something on the back
he tossed it across to rustaff in
case your conscience bothers you
too much he added and you cant
find anybody to talk to but the cops
call me at that number im the best
little father confessor you ever saw
the cops know me mr north
they know im on the square
thats fine said north because
youll be hearing from the cops dur-
ing the next few hours or im the
king of england so long rustaff

north left the bail-bond
brokers office and headed for
a lunch counter he needed
a sandwich before he went up to see
lieutenant hoag as he had a pretty
good idea of what was coming

  he was not mistaken as soon as
he opened the door to hoags office
the lieutenant started in on him

  you crooked cross-eyed so-and-
so began lieutenant hoag in ap-
propriate language do you know
what i think of you

  dont tell me vincent let me
guess said north

  hoag however left nothing to
norths imagination he was ex-
plicit eloquent and profane he
alluded to norths ancestry his per-
sonal habits and alleged deficiencies
in body and character when he had
finished for want of breath and
further vocabulary north looked at
him with an amazingly bland air of
injured innocence

  what brought this on vincent
he asked

  you stole bendicks finger prints
out of the identification bureau de-
clared hoag you told hewett you
were bringing them to me you lying
such-and-which

  well i was bringing the prints
to you said north and i am here
they are


street  smiths complete stories

 two hours and a half to walk a
hundred yards

  i was detained said north i
had to eat

 where the hell have you been
ive been winning that box of
cigars vincent

  youve been obstructing justice
hoag announced if i had the rec-
ord two hours ago my man wouldnt
have got away

 what man vincent

  the ringer that told us this after-
noon he was arthur bendick

 so you think the real bendick
is the corpse you found in the
launch

finger prints dont lie north
so you concede me the box of
cigars vincent youve given up
insisting that the dead man is mon-
zello

 in a pigs eye said hoag i
dont concede anything its evident
that monzello and bendick are the
same person hewett says they must
be

 want to make it two boxes of
cigars vincent-that the finger
prints in this case are guilty of a
slight duplicity

if youd keep your mouth shut
for a minute north you might find
out something what i been trying
to tell you is that bendick is gone
gone

disappeared gave the boys i
left to watch him a clean slip
took their guns too i suppose
no but hes gone without a trace
they cant figure how he got away
i guess theyll have plenty of
spare time for figuring after theyre
transferred to the far reaches of
brooklyn said north what
makes you think bendick is impor-
tant

 none of your business north
said hoag im through doing you
favors next time i give you any

information itll be when i make the
arrest

  suit yourself vincent said
north taking a hitch in his baggy
trousers if you dont tell me i
wont tell you what louis rustaff
told me

  so youve seen rustaff already
have you what did he say

  tell me what you found out about
bendick

  i didnt find out much about ben-
dick exactly said hoag who after
all was always ready to bargain with
north for information but i found
out plenty about the laughing girl
did you notice the engines in the
two launches

  i did said north theyre ex-
actly alike six l-head cylinders
sy inch bore  stroke generating
two-hundred horsepower what of
it

  did you notice the serial numbers
of the engines asked the police
lieutenant

  i noticed that the serial number
of the one in bendicks boathouse
had been rather neatly obliterated
with a cold chisel said north light-
ing a cigarette

  not bad for a reporter admitted
hoag but i dont suppose you
noted that the serial number of the
engine in the launch we found the
body in was ad- did you
spill it said north im all
a-twitter what did i miss

  the laughing girl registered
under the name of arthur bendick
is also registered as carrying engine
no ad- announced hoag

  huh north squinted through
his cigarette smoke so the murder
was actually committed in bendicks
launch-and the second laughing
girl is a phony

  now tell me what louis rustaff
told you

  nothing replied north
fog over the river



  north if you hold out on me after

ive-

  im not holding out vincent
rustaff claims to know nothing
about bendick except that he went
his bond and he says he hasnt the
slightest idea who bailed out the
ringer for monzello last night to kill
him but rustaff is so enthusiasti-
cally ignorant vincent that he prob-
ably knows the one important fact
that im looking for

  whats that grumbled lieuten-
ant hoag

  the name of the ringer who went
to jail in place of bendick six weeks
ago and monzello just the other day

and who-

  the telephone bell rang hoag
snatched up the receiver

 hello    yes    the
hell you say    never mind
spelling it i know it already

hoag banged down the in-
strument and sat for several
seconds staring at north
with an expression which hovered
between the jubilant and the crest-
fallen finally he said

  you win the cigars north that
was the identification bureau calling
hewett wired the dead mans finger-
print classification to washington
his prints are on file with the navy
department down there seems he
did a short enlistment in the navy
and got a dishonorable discharge for
repeatedly overstaying leave or
something his name is harry dag-
gett

 daggett didnt you-

  i did hoag broke in i found
a letter with talk about exterminat-
ing harry daggett a young tramp
named phil collins that i picked up
in shantytown had it on him lucky
i had enough foresight to have col-
lins shadowed

  aint it though said north

now about those cigars vincent
you-

  lieutenant hoags telephone bell
rang again the big detectives bull
neck turned slowly red as he lis-
tened at last he broke out into pro-
fanity

  why you butter-fingered rube
he sputtered you thick-skulled so-
and-so how the helld you like to
pound a beat again    none-of
your damn excuses come on in

  hoags face was crimson as he
hung up

  that was monday the man i had
trailing collins he explained the
damn fool lost his man in the sub-
way

  your boys aint doing so well to-
day vincent said north looks
as though thered be a lot of detec-
tives pounding beats in brooklyn
and staten island before you solve
the murder of harry daggett i
guess ill have to hustle if i want
to clean up this case in time to go
on my vacation at the end of the
week

  start in by rustling your carcass
out of my office will you north
sputtered hoag still very red its
your fault if-

  all right vincent all right
north backed away from the police
lieutenants desk bowing with mock
politeness ill go and i wont come
back until after youve sweated louis
rustaff when-

  get out of here ordered hoag

  north went he turned up his
coat collar against the cold autumn
wind and walked down the street
whistling to himself things were
breaking right in his alley he could
go home and cover any late develop-
ments by telephone he stopped at
an italian butcher shop

  i want a pound of meat he said

  what kind of meat asked the
butcher


street  smiths complete stories

 raw meat said north and a
couple of bones its for a dog
north lived in greenwich village
in an apartment with a black fire-
place and one hundred years of dirt
neatly covered with cream-colored
paint it had a tree in the court and
was very artistic north cared
neither for the tree nor the artistic
atmosphere he lived there because
the neighbors did not complain much
when his friends threw bottles or
phonograph records out the window
at three in the morning

  at the entrance to his apartment
he stopped short and swore the
door was ajar north kicked it open
glanced about rapidly and from the
doorway threw his package of dog
meat across the room into the fire-
place he knew without looking
that he would not need it that the
little black cocker spaniel that he
had spirited away from the laugh-
ing girl that morning was gone

  as he poured himself a drink he
wondered how he would discover if
the dog had been stolen or if the
door had been merely left open care-
lessly by the colored girl who came
down from harlem twice a week to
wash his glasses and sweep the dirt
from the middle of the floor under
the bed

mayor mike turns sleuth

mayor mike of east river
shantytown sauntered lei-
surely through madison
square the many benches lining
the paths were almost deserted for
it was getting too cold for such
sedentary pursuits as sitting in the
park the trees were almost devoid
of leaves mayor mike however
was devoted to his morning in the
square he had missed it the day
previous due to that infernal busi-
ness with the police the clock in

the metropolitan tower chimed ten
oclock-mayor mikes habitual hour
for his morning devotions to leisure
he cast an experienced eye over the
benches then toward the occasional
trash cans seeking an abandoned
morning paper mayor mikes lei-
sure was occupied with reading of
the world from which he had with-
drawn to a safe philosophical dis-
tance

  he might have spared himself the
long walk to madison square every
day for tomkins and stuyvesant
squares-even union square-were
closer to shantytown however on
the benches and in the trash cans
of tompkins and stuyvesant squares
one was likely to find only such
newspapers as the daily laborer in
union square there was little but the
daily laborer-hardly fit reading
for such a staunch republican as
mayor mike who read the call-dis-
patch in madison square he could
usually find a discarded copy of the
call-dispatch and grumble to him-
self over the writings of its political-
economy columnist he spotted a
copy of his favorite paper which the
wind had blown under a bench
stopped to pick it up hastily
checked over the pages to make sure
that no important part was missing
then settled himself to read he
skimmed headlines until he came to
that rare item-one that concerned
him personally he fumbled for his
corncob pipe with one hand while
he read the story of the murder

  police to-day are seeking six persons-
five as witnesses and possible accom-
plices the sixth on a charge of murder-
in connection with the death of harry
daggett puppet of the underworld

  daggetts body was found yesterday
morning in the launch laughing girl
anchored under an east river pier near
a shanty colony of squatters at the foot
of east ninth street

  daggett was first erroneously identi-
fog over the river



fied as frank monzello one of the four
men indicted for racketeering in fulton
street fish markets who was released on
 bail a few hours before the
murder finger-print evidence however
indicates that daggett was a professional
substitute prisoner probably hired to
serve monzellos term for him

  in this connection detectives want
monzello himself a mysterious person
who delivered the  bond in cash
to have daggett alias monzello re-
leased arthur bendick for whom dag-
gett once also served a jail term on a
minor charge and who owns the launch
in which the body was found philip col-
lins believed to be a professional killer
hired to murder daggett

  lieutenant vincent hoag of the homi-
cide squad is also working on a secondary
theory that daggett may have been killed
by his wife in connivance with one
charles hartford neighbors in the tene-
ment house in east thirteenth street oc-
cupied by the daggetts say that mrs
daggett disappeared the night before the
murder in company with hartford who
is described as an ardent admirer of mrs
daggett posing as a friend of the fam-
ily police learned that an insurance
policy on the life of daggett was issued
about a month ago and that the first pre-
mium was paid by a man answering the
description of hartford

  lieutenant hoag pointed out that the
couple may have engineered the murder
for the double purpose of getting rid of
the husband and collecting his insurance

  mayor mike put down the paper
and lighted his pipe he read no
further but sat staring at the bleak
branches of the leafless tree opposite
his bench the thing that he most
feared had come to pass despite
his efforts to keep shantytown or-
derly and law-abiding the shadow
of disrepute had fallen upon the
little colony of homeless men soon
righteous citizens would be calling
shantytown a resort of criminals and
a breeding place of crime the po-
lice would be criticized for allowing
such conditions to exist wreckers
would come to shantytown the
flimsy shacks would be razed in an
hour mayor mike wondered how

things were in florida this season
he had not gone south for the win-
ter in two years now-two years
since he had been mayor of shanty-
town

  but no he could not run off he
was still mayor his citizens
looked to him for advice-and some
of them were in trouble he would
go back and help them he would
stick as long as a shanty remained
standing responsibility had always
been foreign to his nature but since
he had accepted it this time he
would hang on to the end

  carefully he folded his paper and
put it into his pocket he would
finish reading it at home he had
not yet seen what economic drivel
was being put out to-day

 he walked slowly across the
square to twenty-third street and
turned east to the river he fol-
lowed along the bulkhead line to
avenue c then avenue d

mayor mike went through
the hole in the rusty iron
fence and stood a moment
surveying his domain the police-
men were talking together in front
of spigs piano box stamping their
feet to keep warm for the conser-
vation of driftwood there were
rarely fires in shantytown in the day
time or he supposed the cops would
be inside one of the shacks the
sun was supposed to be all that was
needed in the way of a heating plant
except on the coldest days mayor
mike had given orders however that
a fire be kept in his own shanty on
account of the baby he had told
walrus to put some wood in the
stove yet no smoke curled from the
crooked length of rusty pipe that
rose from the rear of the hut

  mayor mike crossed the old brick-
yard toward the shack always re-
ferred to as the city hall he


street  smiths complete stories

paused in the doorway looking at
the little box which was suspended
by ropes from two hooks that slats
had installed in the sloping roof
there seemed to be no sign of life
in the improvised cradle mayor
mike stepped up looked in the box
was empty

  he went to the door and bellowed
hey walrus

  there was no reply he bellowed
again the two policemen looked
at him suspiciously slats the car-
penter came to the door of his shack

  walrus is gone down to the ful-
ton market said slats for some
more of his blasted fish

  mayor mike walked over to the
carpenters shanty

  you got the baby in here he
asked

  the babys gone said slats
didnt they tell you about it
who wheres it gone
handsome hartford took it
handsome did you mean hand-
some had the nerve to come down
here doesnt he know the cops are
lookin for him asked mayor mike
in an undertone

  he didnt come here said slats
he sent for it spig met him down
the street a piece-either him or the
lady i dont remember which spig
said anyhow whichever it was
wanted the baby spig and red took
it down to em

  guess the babyll be better off
said mayor mike it looks to be a
cold night to-night for sleepin in

shantytown still i dont- he

scratched the back of his head with
the stem of his corncob pipe cant
understand why handsome didnt
come to me he knows he can find
me every mornin in madison square
why do you suppose he risked corn-
in down this way where he knew
thered be cops on the lookout for
him

  i dunno slats replied all i
know is what spig told me

 what else happened while i was
away

 not much there was a couple
of dicks around again asking more
about that kid phil collins

  what y tell em

  they didnt talk to me this time
they talked to spig i heard him
tell em that we didnt know much
about collins on account of he only
came here a couple of nights ago
with handsome

  spig told the dicks collins came
here with handsome

 yes shouldnt he ought to ve
told em that

  guess its all right said mayor
mike he watched the two police-
men a moment then returned to his
own domicile he sat for five min-
utes pensively smoking his pipe
then he arose walked up to four-
teenth street and started across
town

the sidewalks were already
crowded with busy shoppers
mostly plump women mayor
mike moved among them passing
the gawdy bargain windows the red-
and-gold fronts of ten-cent stores
he was paying particular attention
to the host of parasites peculiar to
fourteenth street beggars and
catch-penny hawkers who made their
way through the crowd of shoppers
a legless pencil vender with a bull-
dog two blind men playing saxo-
phones a white-whiskered patriarch
selling pretzels a billowy matron
with bargains in toothpaste and jig-
saw puzzles brass-voiced sidewalk
venders of popular songs imitation
pearl necklaces hot chestnuts
mayor mike strolled through the
restless throng until he perceived
towering above the crowd a fuzzy
greenish fedora and the narrow
fog over the river



shoulders of a rusty black overcoat
with a mangy velvet collar he
changed his course approaching the
fedora from the back

  here yare ladies the bargain of
a lifetime genuine lace handker-
chiefs for a quarter hand-made
brussels lace an imported article
thatd cost you two-three dollars in
any store on fifth avenue pur-
chase of a bankrupt stock enables me
to offer them to you at the ridiculous
price of twenty-five cents apiece
step up lady and examine them
take it in your hand lady and sat-
isfy yourself that its real theres
not a machine-made piece in the lot
look at this one golden with age
how many you too lady giv-
ing them away for twenty-five cents

  handsome hartford was standing
in the midst of a crowd of open-
mouthed ladies in front of him was
a small folding stand piled with
squares of lace several eager
women were fingering the lace in-
credulously handsome hartford
was making change pocketing quar-
ters when mayor mike tapped him
on the shoulder

 immediately without looking
back hartford snapped shut the top
of his stand folding his lace inside
it kicked together the legs put the
whole under his arm and started off
through the crowd

 mayor mike grabbed his arm
hartford turned and smiled nerv-
ously

 hello mayor he said i
thought it was the bulls i havent
got a city license to peddle i cer-
tainly was scared

  seen the papers this morning
handsome asked mayor mike

  hartford nodded

 then how come you takin
chances on the street

  got to have some jack mayor

mike i want to get isabel and the
kid out of town

 how come you didnt get word
to me in the square this morning if
you wanted the baby sent back

  i didnt send for the baby said
hartford

  somebody did said mayor mike
while i was gone somebody told
spig you wanted the baby he took
it away

  good gosh and seven fishes ex-
claimed hartford a shadow of
worry crossed his face then he
smiled maybe isabel did it he
added shes been wanting the
baby with her

 better go right away and find
out counseled mayor mike

 come along mayor hartford
was pushing ahead with long strides

 tell me one thing handsome
said mayor mike puffing slightly in
his efforts to keep up i aint askin
for no confessions or anythin but
am i doin right by the boys in
shantytown by givin you and this
lady a helpin hand

  i told you when i brought isabel
to shantytown said hartford that
i wanted to hide her from people
who didnt mean her any good i
guess i wasnt successful somebody
knew where she was-somebody
probably whod been following me-
and he left the body of her husband
as a warning of what might happen
to her

 how do you know the body was
left there for her asked mayor
mike

  because on the night of the mur-
der just before dawn a mans voice
called isabels name just outside
your shack where she was sleeping
the man told her to look under the

 	

pier-

 whose voice was it asked
mayor mike

  she didnt recognize it


street  smiths complete stories

  who does she think it was

  it might have been one of half a
dozen people

  mayor mike stopped suddenly at
the street corner

  so long handsome he said
holding out his hand if you need
me you know my office hours in the
square

 arent you coming with me
mayor mike

  nope said mayor mike dont
tell me where your hide-out is then
if anybody asks me i wont know

chapter xii

the baby hunt

isabel daggett had a hys-
terical fit of weeping when
handsome hartford repeated
mayor mikes story-far more hys-
terical than the one that had fol-
lowed the discovery of her husbands
body after all harry daggett had
never been precisely a model hus-
band and during the past three
months he had been taking out his
feeling of frustration by giving her
thorough and periodic beatings

whereas the baby-

  i told you we should have taken
him before she wailed

  hartfordtried to comfort her by
saying there had been some mistake
perhaps mayor mike had not under-
stood properly after all he had
not seen spig himself

  but isabel daggett would not be
comforted

  theyve taken him for a hostage
they think i know too much they
have seen in the papers that the po-
lice are looking for you and me
they think well talk if were
caught then theyd kill the baby
she began to scream

  hartford put his hand gently over
her mouth tried to reason with her
he reminded her that there were

men working on other floors of the
loft building in which they were
hiding she must not deliberately
give them away

  isabel daggett struggled briefly
then stopped screaming she looked
about her wild-eyed they were in
a dingy low-ceilinged storeroom
piled high with packing cases and
bales wrapped in waterproof covers
she dropped back trembling on a
deep pile of laces hartford had not
told her that the improvised divan
was worth a fortune in some of the
most valuable laces of europe-
brussels point de paris alengon
bruges valenciennes to her it was
just a rather hard makeshift of a
couch on which she had passed a
cold and uncomfortable night then
she arose standing very straight as
though suddenly imbued with new
strength her dreamy gray eyes
gleamed with the unfamiliar light of
determination born of despair

  maybe june can help me she an-
nounced in a voice hoarse with emo-
tion ill go to see my sister
maybe june will know where the
baby is

  dont be a fool isabel hartford

said youre safe here you-

  im going to the vandoria i
must do something june will help
she flung back her head tossing
her curly hair away from her face
in which a look akin to madness was
creeping

  isabel

  she was already running across
the floor frantically making her way
among the bales and packing cases
before hartford could stop her she
had opened a door and was hurrying
down a dark dusty back stairway

  hartford followed he crossed a
littered courtyard just as she disap-
peared into a passageway as she
reached the street he decided that
to pursue her now would only at-
fog over the river



tract attention he watched her van-
ish among the trucks and vans that
choked greene street

in penthouse b of the vandoria
apartments lieutenant hoag
was questioning william wight
radio patrolmen who had answered
an emergency call from the van-
doria the night previous after hoag
had gone off duty had turned in a
report that sent hoag scurrying for
more information

  why do you think this man col-
lins came back then hoag was
asking

  i suspect there was some senti-
mental attachment between him and
my secretary wight replied i
surprised them once in a tete-a-tete
you dont think he came back
after being fired because of the dag-
gett murder

  well- wight ran his fingers

through his snowy mane inas-
much as my secretary miss lawn
is a sister of daggetts wife and
since you say that collins is impli-
cated i wouldnt be at all surprised
collins seemed to be a generally sus-
picious and shifty character during
the short time he worked here that
i imagine was one of the reasons he
was discharged when i found him
lurking on my terrace last night i
didnt recognize him until he at-
tacked me and i was forced to shoot
in self-defense you say he hasnt
been apprehended he must be

wounded im sure-

  no sign of him said hoag tell
me mr wight what sort of man was
this daggett

  i never saw him said wight
neither he nor his wife ever came
to see miss lawn here i didnt per-
mit it i know them only from hear-
ing their names

  what time was it that the ambu-
lance came for miss lawn

  it was nearly midnight i should
say

  and you dont think she was put-
ting it on

  i hardly think so miss lawn
was clearly a nervous type and i
had noticed that she had been act-
ing queerly for some time the ex-
citement of last night must have
sent her completely out of her head
and i thought it best to have her
taken to some psychopathic hospital
for observation the ambulance sur-
gean can tell you about her hyster-
ical behavior the insane way in
which she screamed accusations at
me-of every crime under the sun
she had enough sense left to
jump out of the ambulance and get
clean away anyhow said lieuten-
ant hoag

  very careless of them said
wight with a movement of his
bushy eyebrows she might prove
to be a dangerous maniac and shes
still at large

  yep said hoag did this man
daggett ever telephone you mr
wight

  never said wight

  never telephoned this apart-
ment

  possibly he may have telephoned
to my secretary i couldnt be sure
of that

  that might explain his having
the telephone number of the van-
doria written in his hat

  it might

  where did your secretary work
mr wight

  in the next room

  hoag got up and walked to the
door

that her typewriter he asked
thats the machine she used
have you got a letter or some-
thing-a sample of the typing that
machine does

  i dont believe there are any let-


street  smiths complete stories

ters around said wight couldnt
you make your own sample

  maybe said hoag he fitted a
piece of paper into the typewriter
sat down and pecked clumsily at
the keyboard until he had written
several lines including impressions
of every letter and character

  as he pulled the paper out of the
machine the telephone bell rang

  ill take that mr wight said
hoag its probably one of the men
i left downstairs in the lobby

  he picked up the instrument
hello hoag speaking   
she is   the hell you say
well bring her up

  he replaced the receiver

  the widow daggett is down in
the lobby he explained to wight
yelling her head off for her sister
and raising hell generally theyre
bringing her up

  i wish they wouldnt said
wight id rather not have any-
thing to do with her

  theyre bringing her up re-
peated the lieutenant looking at
wight with steady eyes

  two minutes later isabel daggett
entered between two detectives she
was badly disheveled and sobbing
hysterically

  wheres june wheres my sis-
ter

  sit down lady said hoag tak-
ing her by the arm and leading her
to a chair keep calm and every-
thingll be all right you know this
gentleman dont you

  he indicated wight

  wight ran his fingers quickly
through his hair isabel daggett
stared at him without speaking

  ever see this man before
prompted hoag

  wight put his hands in his pock-
ets watching silently

  isabel daggett shook her head

  i dont know him she sobbed

i want june lawn june can help

me find my baby i want-

 what happened to your baby
mrs daggett asked hoag
charlie made me leave him in

that shantytown and hes-

  so that was your baby exploded
hoag and that old codger tried
to make me believe it was his i
knew it wasnt

  theyve taken it away sobbed
mrs daggett

  whos taken it

  i dont know wailed mrs dag-
gett

  youre sure you dont know that
gentleman standing there

  i never saw him before i want
my-

  all right mrs daggett hoag
took her arm again you come with
me ill find your baby for you
he nodded to wight i think ill
take her downtown after all he
said hope i havent caused you
too much trouble

  not at all said wight

  at the sound of his voice isabel
daggett turned to look at wight
again

  come on mrs daggett said
lieutenant hoag

  wight watched them get into the
elevator then closed the door

chapter xiii

rendezvous

june lawn had spent most of
the night shivering in a clump
of bushes in central park it
had been simple enough escaping
from the ambulance which wight
had called with the idea of having
her committed as insane she had
merely feigned exhausted sleep
when the ambulance surgeons at-
tention was relaxed she had come
to life opened the doors and jumped
out she had bruised herself as she

com- a
fog over the river



landed on the paved park road but
the excitement of flight and hiding
listening breathlessly as she heard
the ambulance crew pass near her
place of concealment when they
came back to look for her made her
forget her aches it was only when
she felt herself definitely free that
her troubles really began what
was she to do now

  when it was daylight she took a
subway to grand central station and
performed a rudimentary toilet in
the dressing room there she spent
most of the morning at breakfast
in an obscure restaurant reading and
rereading the accounts of the dag-
gett murder in the morning papers
until she was certain that the wait-
ress was looking at her suspiciously
she paid her check and went out

  instinctively she went to her sis-
ters address in east thirteenth
street but when she saw two uni-
formed policemen standing on the
stoop she walked past without mak-
ing inquiries then she headed for
east river and shantytown phil
collins had told her to come to
shantytown if she needed help

  she hesitated as she stepped
through the hole in the fence men
looked at her suspiciously with
glances that were almost hostile
she started walking through the col-
ony of huts a man with red hair
came up to her

  help you lady he asked

  im looking for a man named
myron klinger she said inventing
a name she felt that she ought to
have some excuse for invading
shantytown and after she had read
the papers she wasnt sure that she
ought to mention collinss name i
understand he lives here i have a
message for him from his family
in the west

  the man shook his red head

  nobody here by that name-

 com-a

though theres plenty here that we
dont know their names look
around and maybe youll see him
june lawn walked farther across
shantytown she sensed that some
one was following her she stopped
and turned around the man came
up he was a dark slim man with
sideburns that came halfway down
each tanned cheek he wore a
striped jersey sweater and a navy
blue beret

  did you say you were looking for
a man named collins he asked

  i didnt say that said the girl
  but you are looking for collins
  the girl did not answer

  its all right to talk said the
man im a friend of his youre
miss lavn aint you

  yes admitted the girl

  collins left word that if you came
down here to tell you to meet him
at this address at midnight to-night
he handed the girl a slip of pa-
per she read a scribbled address
ioi greene street

  its a loft building the man ex-
plained you go right through to
the back of the courtyard where the
trucks come in and take the little
stairway in back its the third floor
where hell be

  thank you said the girl staring
at the address how did collins
come to choose that place she sup-
posed it was all right

  she left hurriedly the man
watched her leave shantytown then
started to saunter after her as he
reached the fence the entrance was
blocked by the bulky form of mayor
mike returning mayor mike slapped
him on the chest with the flat of his
hand

  spig said mayor mike whats
this hooey you been handin out
about handsome sendin for the
baby

  thats straight said spig


street  smiths complete stories

  straight hell said mayor mike
i just come from seein handsome
and he says he didnt do nothin of
the kind

  either hes crazy or one of us is
lying replied spig he told me it
was too cold for the baby down here
and i was to take the baby to one
of these nurseries where it can get
tooken care of he gave me money
to pay the brats board and keep

  i dont believe it said mayor
mike

  i got the receipt from the nur-
sery said spig

  lets see it

  handsome told me not to tell no-
body where the kid was but i guess
he wouldnt care if you knew

 spig displayed a slip of paper
carefully holding his thumb over the
address of the nursery

 you put him down in my name
exclaimed mayor mike

  sure said spig didnt i hear
you tell the cops it was your kid
mayor mike snorted

 spig he said why should
handsome be lyin to me about
this

 search me said spig but if
you dont believe me i can take you
over to the nursery and show you
the brat 

 mayor mike seemed to be study-
ing spigs sideburns for a long min-
ute at last he asked

  any news of that collins kid
  no word said spig

 mayor mike walked slowly to his
shack sat down in his chair filled
his pipe and unfolded the morning
paper he had not finished reading

 night stalked up east river to
shantytown cloaked in a cold swirl-
ing veil of half-melted snow fires
burned in cracked stoves and dented
oil cans making bright orange
chinks shine through the flimsy walls
of the rickety shelters to the men

inside it was the wind that revealed
the chinks they sat huddled lose
to their meager fires wondering over
the price that penniless men paid for
being independent through the win-
ter the municipal lodging house
at least was heated

close on the heels of dark-
ness phil collins came to
shantytown he did not
come through the hole in the iron
fence but over the wall of an adjoin-
ing foundry he came stealthily for
he knew that daggetts body had
been identified that he was being
sought again by the police once
inside the abandoned brickyard
however he walked boldly-as
though he had been there all day-
trusting to the wet night to protect
him he went directly to mayor
mikes shack

  mayor mike paused in the midst
of explaining the war debts and the
gold standard to walrus and stared
at collins as though he were a ghost

  what you doin here demanded
mayor mike dont you read the
papers

  nobody saw me come said col-
lins his coat glistened with the
wet

  theys probably a couple o dicks
sittin around somewhere no farther
awayn i could toss this stove said
mayor mike he got out of his
chair to turn down the lamp

  i had to come said collins
anyhow im in the clear on this
daggett business

  did handsome get you mixed up
in it

 not exactly im not really
mixed up in it-except from outside
appearances

  the insides o jails is often filled
by outside appearances said mayor
mike i remember one time in chi-
fog over the river



  the reason i came back inter-
rupted collins is that i told a girl
that she could find me here if she
needed my help that was before i
knew the cops were after me again
has she been around

  dont know of it said mayor
mike you walrus

  walrus shook his head collinss
face darkened

  in case she does come he said
preparing to leave will you take
the message tell her ill come
back and get it to-morrow

  you might ask some o the boys
said mayor mike had any sup-
per

  i ate three cents worth at that
penny cafeteria in the thirties said
collins i got two cents left so i
can eat again to-morrow

  listen said mayor mike i
dont like to slander the good name
o any citizen o shantytown but its
my duty to warn you to listen twice
to anythin that either handsome
hartford or spig says to you one
of ems a liar-i dunno which
thanks said collins good
night

  night said mayor mike
  ditto said walrus

  collins stepped out into the dark-
ness he stood a moment blinded
by a swirl of melted snow as he
blinked the moisture off his eye-
lashes he saw a shadow of a man
move out from the corner of mayor
mikes shack he thought he heard
the name collins whispered into
the wind the shadow stood mo-
tionless as he moved close to it he
peered into the mans face and recog-
nized spig

  girl came around here s after-
noon looking for you said spig

 she was whered she go
asked collins eagerly

  she wanted to see you bad said
spig said for you to meet her at

five minutes to twelve at
greene street

  to-night

  yeah five minutes to midnight
here i wrote down the number on a
piece of paper she says its a loft
building and to go through the
courtyard where the trucks come in
and go up the stairs in back to the
third floor shell meet you there
thanks said collins then he
remembered that mayor mike had
said to listen twice to whatever spig
or handsome hartford told him
did-do you happen to know the
girls name he asked

 june or lawn or something like
that said spig

 that checked all right collins

thought still-

 mayor mike didnt say anything
about a girl coming for me he said

 the mayor was gone when she
came said spig she says i was
to tell you and nobody else some
sort of secret

 that sounded reasonable too
mayor mike said he didnt know
whether spig or handsome hart-
ford was the liar probably hand-
some he had acted furtively be-
fore the murder anyhow collins
could not take a chance on not going
to the rendezvous if june lawn
really wanted to see him he would

go-

  thanks he said again so long
spig

 he walked across shantytown to-
ward the foundry wall as he passed
the old limousine body in which red
lived he heard red fortified against
the cold by an internal dose of
canned heat singing lustily all by
himself swinging himself over the
wall collins caught fragments of a
rousing limerick

chapter xiv

a squall at sea

the bulky two-masted fishing
schooner spray buried her
nose in the gray-green sea
tons of glassy water pouring over
the bow was churned white as it
rushed over the planking sloshing
about the deck house and streamed
off the sides in a great white fringe
as the ship lifted sickeningly on the
crest of the next wave all canvas
had been struck and the spray
chugged into the teeth of a scream-
ing gale forging slowly ahead on
her auxiliary engine a leaden sky
was bringing early darkness

  frank monzello uncrowned king
of the fulton fish-market racketeers
sat in the skippers tiny cabin feel-
ing very miserable his pasty face
was pale with a distinct yellow
tinge verging on green about the
corners of his mouth his dark hair
usually slicked down flat was di-
sheveled what was more monzello
the dapper didnt care he was sea-
sick he had been ignominiously
seasick all day he couldnt stay on
deck because of the weather he
couldnt stay below because the gaso-
line fumes from the auxiliary engine
increased his nausea

  the small portable radio receiver
in the skippers cabin was droning
figures hours of the clock direc-
tions of the wind and a code broad-
cast from a short-wave station in
boston that gave men at sea quota-
tions on the current prices of fish
so that skippers could estimate the
value of their catch and come in
early if necessary to meet the
market

hell monzello got up twisted

the dial of the radio lets get some
news bulletins

  he turned the knob the loud-
speaker howled sang and vibrated
with jazz monzello tuned in on a
new york station broadcasting
news he listened listlessly to the
result of a prize fight political gos-
sip election returns from a state
voting to repeal prohibition then
he stiffened with interest

  heres some police news for you
folks the announcer was saying
the body of the murdered man
found on the launch laughing girl
in east river this morning at first
thought to be that of frank mon-
zello alleged fish-market racketeer
has been positively identified to-
night as that of harry daggett po-
lice say daggett was a minor under-
world character hired by monzello
to go to jail in his place they are
looking for monzello of course but
theyre looking for other suspects
too theres mrs daggett for in-
stance widow of the murdered man
who disappeared with a man named
hartford the night of the murder
theyre looking for arthur bendick
who owns the launch laughing girl
they already have several suspects
in custody and lieutenant hoag of
the homicide squad expects develop-
ments in a few hours this program
has been coming to you through the
courtesy of-

  monzello turned off the radio he
swallowed hard to fight down his
nausea

  skipper you got to take me back
to new york he announced

  the skipper had been getting into
his oilskin pants preparatory to go-
ing on deck

  what you want to go back for
he asked sounds to me like youre
wanted for murder youre better
off out here

  i got to go back and keep things
fog over the river



in hand he said those damn
fools will make a mess of everything
unless im there why do you sup-
pose i hired that boob daggett to
take the rap for me in the first place
so i could keep my hands free to
reorganize i said last may that
id be boss of these docks in six
months and i will i made a mis-
take sneaking out to sea like this
i shouldnt have listened to those
others frank monzello dont need
to hide

  besides said the skipper sol-
emnly a man dont get seasick in
jail

  the hell with that said mon-
zello his effort to swagger was
only partly successful they wont
see frank monzello in the can not
yet they wont im too smart for
em take me back skipper i got
business in new york

i aint due back until friday
dawn said the skipper i got
fish to catch this aint no
pleasure cruise even if you are a
passenger

  ill pay for whatever damn fish
you dont catch said monzello i
never let a few measly dollars keep
me from having my way

  the skipper finished putting on
his oilskins before he replied

  you may be able to graft half a
million dollars a year outa those
poor scared fishmongers in the ful-
ton market he said at last but im
still skipper of this schooner ill
be damned if i have to take orders
from no seasick racketeer

  so youre not going back

  the spray docks friday morn-
ing said the skipper

  frank monzellos tortured face
turned a shade greener

  all right he said his old blus-
ter was beginning to come through
youll remember this

 something in the tone of mon-
zellos voice caused a troubled ex-
pression to come into the skippers
eyes he seemed to hesitate as
though seeking a way to give in to
monzello without losing face as
skipper

  tell you what said the skipper
drawing a deep breath we may
cross some other smack on her way
in to-night i could put you aboard
her if youre set on getting back

  i dont care how you do it said
monzello but get met back

  an hour later the skipper of the
spray hailed the red-and-green
lights of another small craft that
came bobbing toward him out of the
stormy night the voice borne on
the wind from the direction of the
running lights announced that she
was the alfred q bound for new
york

 with a line around his waist
frank monzello was transferred to
the inbound schooner the alfred
q was due at the fulton street
docks at dawn thursday

der

  north laughed out great clouds of
smoke

night said north ill even tell

amount of the bond hell fix

 hoag swore

  dont act so unfamiliar with the
workings of our courts and the prac-
tices of bail-bond brokers vincent
laughed north somebody might
take you for a policeman and if
you try to keep rustaff from getting
bail hell be out on a writ of habeas
corpus first thing in the morning
shall i talk to him then

 go home and talk to yourself
growled hoag

 cheerio vincent said north
pulling his hat down over his eyes
preparatory to leaving thanks for
the stogie

 north took a taxi home during
the ride he occupied his mind in-
venting means of putting the fare
on his expense account

 as he opened the door of his
apartment he saw a tiny spot of
ruddy light glowing in the darkness
across the room he stood still in
the doorway his door had been
locked-of that he was sure

 he stepped into the dark room
he sniffed at the fragrance of burn-
ing tobacco the glowing point of
light described a short downward
arc as though a man had removed

 a cigarette from his mouth the
door clicked shut behind north the
smoker cleared his throat

  norths hand groped nervously
over the wall seeking the electric
switch as his fingers found the but-
ton he hesitated what would hap-
pen when he switched on the light
would the revelation of his posi-
tion bring a fusillade of shots he
had no idea who the man with the
cigarette might be but for the mo-
ment north had the advantage of
him-if he were only armed still
the man in the dark had a perfect
target to shoot at when north was
silhouetted in the doorway a moment
ago and there had been no shooting

  cant we have a little light mr
north asked a high squeaky voice

  north snapped the switch

in the easiest easy-chair sat a lean
man in a greasy leather wind-
breaker north recognized his
sharp weather-tanned face

  hello bendick said north he
noticed that bendick was not smok-
ing his gaze traveled across the
table the burning cigarette the
lighted end pointing toward the
door was lying on the edge of an
ash tray four feet from bendick

  bendick followed norths gaze

  i dont take chances mr north
he said in reply to norths unasked
question some people is jumpy
some people shoot at cigarette butts
in dark rooms

  come for your dog bendick
asked north

 what dog

  the black cocker spaniel

  i heard you sneaked that cocker
off the boat while the cops was busy
with daggetts body said bendick

  well informed arent you

  pretty well said bendick but

i	didnt come about the dog it aint
my dog
fog over the river



  you had him with you on long
island

  i was just taking care of him for
a friend

  what friend

  guess you heard about me slip-
ping away from those dicks over at
my place know how i did it
easy applejack

  what friend north repeated

  they liked my applejack ben-
dick continued blithely ignoring
norths question they finished the
bottle i went down in the cellar
for another theys a back door to
the cellar-

  youre not going to tell me who
owns the dog

  no

  suppose i get the cops

 you wouldnt do that mr
north squeaked bendick you
would first find out what i came here
for you are a newspaper reporter
not a cop i used to write a little
myself

  well what did you come here
for

  to wait for a telephone call said
bendick

  nice of you to make your head-
quarters in my apartment said
north why did you pick me for
the honor

  when you come to my place with
lieutenant hoag i ask one of the
dicks who you are bendick replied
he tells me you are north of the
tabloid i read your paper every
day

  thanks said north dryly

  i notice bendick continued
that the tabloid goes strong for in-
side crime stuff confessions of
murderers stuff like that he
pulled a crumpled piece of newspa-
per out of his pocket and unfolded
it last week you had this pretty
ax slayer bares all condemned
blond who killed millionaires son

 writes exclusive story for tabloid

and-

 dont read it to me interrupted
 north i wrote it

sure that woman cant even
write her own name

 but she got the money for it just
 the same

 plenty said north

how much you suppose ben-
dick asked the tabloid would pay
for the inside story of the daggett
murder

 so thats it

how much

 damn little said north its a
 low-life story daggett wasnt any-
 body important-

 but the story is good insisted
 bendick shrilly even the times
 put it on the first page to-day on ac-
 count of the scandal of substitute
 prisoners and the fish-market racket
 being important news how much
 ten grand

 youre dreaming said north
 five hundred dollars maybe

 i got to have five thousand at
 least

 dick

north pulled a flattened pack
from his pocket and poked a
twisted cigarette into his
mouth while he was fumbling for
a match the telephone bell rang in
the next room

  bendick sprang to his feet stared
for the door then stopped and
looked at north the bell rang
again

  if thats the call you were expect-
ing said north youd better an-
swer it im going down to the cor-
ner for a bottle of gin

  bendick whipped out a gun

  you stay here he ordered in his
high voice you aint gonna trace
this call

  north stared at the gun the bell
continued to ring north walked de-
liberately up to bendick bendick
did not move north scratched his
match on the barrel of bendicks re-
volver and lighted his cigarette
the bell was still ringing north
blew smoke in bendicks face

  go answer the phone he said

  still holding his gun bendick
stepped up to the instrument north
leaned indolently against the wall
and listened

  hello said bendick    yes
yes    everythings set   
midnight i aint forgot    sure
ill wait till theyre all in    no
not a chance of it    no there

ceiver

mitter hello this is north stuy-

vesant - give me a report on

dick you cant trace a call after

north and now ill call my office

  he called another number and con-
versed in an undertone his ciga-
rette waggled between his lips as he
spoke into the transmitter when
he had finished he announced
bendick the tabloid is foolish
enough to think your story is worth
as much as you do theyll send a
check for five grand down to my
apartment as soon as im convinced
that the story is authentic im not
convinced yet

-even if one of em is me

 he backed out of the apartment
closing the door after him

n orth switched out the light
then went to the door and
- opened it a crack he heard
bendicks footsteps going down the
last stairs he stood listening after
bendick had gone out into the street
he thought he heard a board creak
on the stairs leading to the next floor
above then he noticed for the first
time that some one had extinguished
the light in the stairway he struck
a match

  by the sputtering flare he saw the
back of a man trying to walk quietly
upstairs he thought he recognized
the corpulent outlines the derby hat

  hey rustaff he called where

 louis rustaff the bail-bond
broker turned

ment

gasoline

 at ten minutes before midnight
on thursday phil collins
l - was walking down greene
street toward the address at which
spig had said june lawn was to
meet him he passed dark cliffs of
ugly lifeless loft buildings the
neighborhood occupied by small
manufacturing firms and whole-

salers was deserted at night his
footsteps echoed on the wet pave-
ment

  the cold had increased the driz-
zle had turned to sleet occasional
flakes of soft damp snow clung to
his thin coat it was hard to read
the numbers on the buildings

 it was nearly midnight when he
located  greene street the
number was over an archway through
which trucks could drive into a
courtyard beside the arch were
several tarnished black-and-gold
signs by the dim light from the
street lamp at the far corner he read
them

rosen
celluloid collars

revelation lace factory
boys trousers

  a square of damp cardboard hang-
ing from a nail flapped in the wind
bearing a message scribbled in pen-
cil collins took one hand from his
pocket to hold the cardboard steady
he read

girl operator wanted

 he walked on through the drive-
way wondering what he would say
if he were stopped by a night watch-
man he saw nobody about how-
ever he crossed the sleet-swept
courtyard and looked up at the win-
dows of the loft building they
were all dark he wondered why
june lawn had picked this particu-
lar place as a rendezvous perhaps
because it was isolated-desolate
even

  at the back of the court he found
the door that spig had told him
about he turned the knob the
door opened he stepped inside
closing the door behind him it was
pitch dark inside he sniffed the
darkness reeked with a peculiar odor
-an unclean smell of dust and cob-
webs blended with a faint sweetish
fog over the river



scent that might have been the fumes
of raw gasoline

  he stood still for several seconds
listening he tried to strike a match
but the match was wet then he de-
cided that perhaps he had better
make his way in the dark he ad-
vanced with groping steps until his
foot struck something hard it was
the stairway spig had mentioned
he started to climb

  at the second-floor landing he
stopped again he thought he had
heard a footstep he looked behind
him he saw nothing in the dark-
ness he stood motionless again
he thought he heard a sound of
movement

  he turned toward the door at the
second landing the door was
closed his eyes were becoming ac-
customed to the darkness but he
could not read the sign tacked on
the panel he reached for the door-
knob and tried to turn it it turned
slowly stiffly as if some one were
holding it from the other side or
perhaps the spring was merely stiff
whatever it was he could not open
the door locked probably

  collins continued his way up the
stairs his heartbeat increased as a
worn wooden step creaked under
his weight something about the
old loft building was making him
jumpy the smell perhaps the
odor of gasoline fumes was stronger
on this floor he found himself
walking on tiptoe then he smiled
at his own jumpiness and stepped
out quite boldly onto the third land-
ing

  the door on the third floor was
wide open he walked into the long
barren low-ceilinged room the
lights of the city reflected dimly
from the overcast sky came faintly
through three windows at one end
sleet was streaking the panes with
cold ghostly fingers there were

cobwebs in the corners of the win-
dows

  the dim glow from the windows
was barely enough to give spectral
outlines to the array of crates and
packing cases piled on the floor
collins found a dry match and struck
it the flame revealed only more
boxes extending beyond the ring of
light almost at his feet was what
appeared to be a pile of rags col-
lins stooped fingered the rags they
were lace his thoughts jumped
back to a few nights previous when
mayor mike in shantytown had
told him that handsome hartford
sold lace in fourteenth street

  the match went out

  this was indeed a strange place
that june lawn had picked to meet
him in she wasnt here yet of
course he called her name-just to
make sure the sound of his own
voice in the darkness startled him
there was no reply

collins had a sudden un-
canny impression that he was
not alone in the room as he
stood listening he could detect no
specific sound that would indicate
anothers presence yet he was almost
certain that there was another liv-
ing being somewhere in the dark-
ness he walked a few steps among
the packing cases deliberately mak-
ing plenty of noise with his heels
again he stopped to listen

  this time he heard a door close
it appeared to be the door at the
foot of the stairway he heard some
one coming up the stairs the foot-
steps were light

  he walked quickly back to the
door opening on the landing this
time he was walking on his tiptoes
again the footsteps continued to
climb they were light steps he
peered around the corner of the
door but could not see who was
	street  smiths complete stories

climbing in the darkness he called
june

 a shadow on the landing material-
 ized as june lawn

 phil then you really are here
 you knew id be didnt you
 collins led her off the landing into
 the room full of packing cases

 i didnt know this is such a

strange place-

 it is a funny place said collins
 do you smell gasoline

 i did a moment ago its prob-
 ably that celluloid collar factory on
 the floor below

 you seem to know all about this
 building said collins

 i ought to although ive never
 been here before this is the loft
 building that mr wight owns said
 the girl

 it is

 yes didnt you know that
 no

then how did you happen to
come here

 i came because i knew youd be
 here said collins

 but you were the one who left
 this address with that man in shanty-
 town protested the girl

 i never heard of this address till
 spig gave it to me this evening he
 said youd given it to him

you somethings wrong who
is spig why did he send us both
here asked the girl

 yes something very definitely was
 wrong it was spig mayor mike
 had told him to listen twice to any-
 thing spig said what was spigs
 idea anyhow

 wed better get out of here said
 collins

 june lawn suddenly clutched his
 arm

 whats that she whispered

 i smell smoke collins replied
 no i heard something dont
 you hear it

  collins listened he heard a dry
rustling sound like the faint snap-
ping of twigs

  sounds like a fire crackling he
said or rats

  i heard a groan the girl insisted
a man groaning back there in the
dark among those boxes

  again collins listened he heard
no groan but he heard the same
crackling and snapping he had no-
ticed a few seconds before it was
louder now and the rustle had
grown to a steady hissing murmur
like the sound made by a fire being
sucked up a chimney by a strong
draft there was no mistaking the
smell of smoke collins turned his
head

  good heavens he exclaimed
look

  the wall beyond the landing was
aglow with a ruddy flickering light
-the mottled reflection of flames

 quick said collins we-

  his words were interrupted by
two loud explosions in rapid succes-
sion there followed a brief frantic
scampering of feet on the stairway
a door slammed

  what was that demanded june
lawn in a terrified whisper

  shots said collins in the
stairway

 who-

  stay here ill be right back to
get you

  collins ran to the door as he
stepped out on the landing a scorch-
ing breath of hot air swept up from
below flames choked the lower
part of the stairway

  collins blinked at the glare of the
fire shaded his eyes from the heat
and peered down the stairs on the
floor of the second landing a mans
forearm protruded from the half-
open door the hand lay palm up-
ward the curled fingers stiff and mo-
tionless
fog over the river



chapter xvii

smoked out

collins ran down a few
steps he could not see to
whom the hand belonged
the mans head and body were hid-
den behind the door

 collins stopped he could go no
farther the heat from the flames
that were slowly advancing up the
stairway with a dull greedy roar
was intense clouds of acrid smoke
were rolling out of the doorway in
which the unknown man was lying
the smoke billowed up into the
stairway as into a chimney collins
was seized with a fit of coughing
his eyes filled with tears it was
no use he would have to retreat
he would probably be of no use to
the man in the doorway anyhow
the two shots had doubtless done
for him he must be dead

 june lawn was waiting on the
landing the glare of the fire
lighted her anxious frightened face

  we cant get out this way said
collins he didnt mention the
mans hand if the girl had not seen
it there was no use adding to her
terror now

  theres no fire escape at the back
windows said the girl i looked
whatll we do

  how about the front of the build-
ing

  i think theres a fire escape there
but im not sure this room runs
through to the front

  well try it said collins

  there was a tinkle of falling glass
the room was suddenly brightly
illuminated the fire had broken
through the windows on the floor be-
low and streamers of flame were
twisting skyward

  collins pushed the girl before him
as he threaded his way through the
labyrinth of packing cases they

had gone about twenty paces when
the girl drew back abruptly into col-
linss arms she screamed collins
felt his scalp crawl

  he looked down two feet were
sticking out from behind a packing
case was this another dead man
no because the feet moved by the
glow of the fire collins saw a pair
of spats hiding the disreputable tops
of well-worn shoes

  hartford he exclaimed

  he hurried around the box and
stooped over handsome hartford
was lying on the floor bound and
gagged collins pulled a wad of
lace from hartfords mouth hart-
ford gasped collins started to work
on the ropes that tied his hands

  what happened handsome he
asked

  i dont know said hartford
dully i was sitting here waiting
for isabel to come back it was
dark somebody came up behind me
and hit me over the head i just
came to a little while ago i was

hog-tied-

  collins was having trouble with
the knots june lawn was helping
him the floor was hot and smoke
was oozing up through the cracks in
murky spirals the glare in the
doorway was very bright now

  does this room run through to
the front asked collins

  no said hartford whats the
matter why is it so hot in here
the buildings on fire said col-
lins he loosened the last knot
jerked the rope free and pulled
hartford to his feet come on he
said well try to make the roof
its our only chance

  hartford was wabbly on his feet
collins and the girl supported him
on either side hurried him to the
stairway the roaring flames were
eating into the third landing when
they reached it they pulled hart-


street  smiths complete stories

ford through the lurid fringe of fire
stumbled with him into the stairway
started climbing into the hot chok-
ing smoke collins heard sirens out-
side the fire department was com-
ing

 bend over gasped collins
walk low you can breathe bet-
ter

 they plunged blindly upward two
flights three flights coughing and
gasping collinss lungs were burn-
ing and tears streamed from his ach-
ing eyes he felt hartford suddenly
pull back

  i forgot something gasped hart-
ford i left my hat down there

  come on ordered collins hart-
ford stumbled on obediently

  one more flight but it seemed to
take a year before collins groping
in the smoke found the door to the
roof he kicked it open the two
men and the girl staggered out into
the snowy night

collins turned his face up-
ward to the cold caress of the
driving sleet he filled his
lungs with fresh freezing air he
heard men shouting above the sounds
of bells and sirens in the street

  theres a fire escape at the front
panted hartford

 im going to look announced
collins dont move before i tell
you

  the flat wet roof was beginning to
steam as he ran over it toward the
street he reached the low parapet
put his head over drew it back
quickly flames were leaping from
the front windows surging upward
over the fagade of the building the
mounting smoke and heat scorched
collinss face the smoke increased
as a pounding stream of water from
the first nozzle ripped against the
blazing structure smashing win-
dows

 through a break in the smoke
screen collins saw firemen dragging
more fat hoses across the street he
saw a crew raising an extension lad-
der he heard the rhythmic beat of
pumps the screeching sirens of more
fire apparatus arriving he heard a
man bellowing was it a trick of
his imagination or was the man bel-
lowing his name he squinted
through the smoke peered down
again he saw a green police car
parked among the red fire trucks six
stories below then he recognized
lieutenant hoag

 hoag was looking upward he
had a revolver in his hand and was
making threatening gestures as he
bellowed something to the man on
the roof collins did not under-
stand the words but he understood
the sense he drew away from the
parapet and started back to the rear
of the roof where june lawn and
handsome hartford were waiting

  rescue by firemen was out of the
question now hoag already sus-
pected him of a hand in the daggett
murder if the body of the man on
the second landing was found by the
firemen before the flames destroyed
it completely collins would be again
incriminated even if they found
only a charred skeleton he would
undoubtedly be accused-particu-
larly as he could not tell who the
man was

  you folks go to the front and try
to get down the fire escape said
collins the firemen will help
you

  and you asked june lawn

  the cops are down there said
collins i saw hoag he recog-
nized me im going to try to stay
clear

  well stay with you said the
girl

  sure said hartford lets get
away over the roofs
fog over the river



the roof of the adjoining
building was a story higher
collins climbed on hartfords
shoulders got his fingers over the
edge of a cornice pulled himself up
hartford boosted the girl into col-
linss arms then helped himself by
digging his toes into the bricks
while collins leaning down gripped
his wrists and slowly raised him
for half a block they made their way
among the water tanks chimneys
and skylights of roofs of the same
level then they came to a two-
story drop

  looks like were licked said
hartford

  if we could get around the cor-
ner into the next street said col-
lins maybe hoag hasnt had time
to get enough reenforcements to sur-
round the block

  theres a flagpole said hart-
ford why not-

  but collins had seen the pole too
he was already unwinding the rope
from behind the cleat hartford cut
through a knot collins pulled the
loose end through the pulley at the
top of the pole

  collins made one end of the rope
fast around a vent pipe sticking out
of the roof he looped the other end
under junes arms and lowered her
to the roof of the next building
twenty feet below collins and hart-
ford went down the rope hand over
hand

  the building they were on now
did not face on greene street col-
lins went to the parapet and looked
over there was not even a fire
truck in the side street the excite-
ment still centered around the cor-
ner now to get down

  theres a fire escape over here
called june softly it goes down
into a little alley

  collins ran along the wet roof to
join her he had gone a dozen steps

when he heard a crash behind him
he turned handsome hartford
was gone a broken skylight gaped
near by collins ran over peered
down through the broken panes he
called

  you hurt hartford

  im all right came hartfords
voice from the darkness i slipped
on the wet roof lucky i only
dropped one floor i-im not hurt
can you get back up asked col-
lins shall i get a piece of that
rope

  june lawn was at his side peer-
ing into the broken skylight

  dont stop to help me said hart-
ford itll take too long you two
go on without me im all right
ill get out through the building
try to reach my hand hand-
some

  go on-dont wait called hart-
ford ill make it all right wed
have had to separate anyhow
hartford was right there was no
time to lose in another minute or
two the neighborhood would be
swarming with police good luck
handsome

  collins led the girl to the fire es-
cape as they started down the lad-
derlike iron stairs collins heard re-
newed moaning of sirens he won-
dered of it was more fire apparatus
responding to another alarm or po-
lice cars summoned by lieutenant
hoag junes heels clicked on the
metallic rungs as they climbed down

  the fire escape ended on a plat-
form one story from the ground
collins swung himself over and
dropped june jumped collins
caught her in his arms as he let
her feet slip down to the pavement
he felt his arm seized he turned
his head

  a man was standing beside him
the man wore a light-colored over-
coat pinched sharply at the waist


street  smiths complete stories

melted snow was dripping off his
gray slouch hat he did not release
his hold on collinss arm

  evening said the man i was
waiting for you folks lets take a
little walk

  collins felt his heart pounding

  who are you he demanded

  ill tell you later maybe said
the man in the slouch hat come

  m

on

 collins held back something
about this man something furtive
told him that he was not one of
hoags men he did not act like a
policeman

  what authority- collins be-
gan

 this the man announced
something metallic gleamed in his
free hand walk now and walk
fast you too girlie move

  collins bewildered started down
the alley he felt the muzzle of a
revolver poking him in the small of
the back

  faster said the man

  collins and the girl obeyed

  half a block away around the cor-
ner luminous saffron-colored clouds
were still pouring into the sky from
the burning loft building

chapter xviii

a familiar face

hen rustaff left jim
north went into the closet
that his optimistic landlord
called a kitchenette and poured him-
self a drink gulping it down he
poured another the night was cold
and he was going out he had told
rustaff he was staying home but he
had no intention of sitting around
twiddling his thumbs until arthur
bendick should return at twelve
thirty north would be back at
twelve thirty to receive bendick and
his inside story of course but in

the meantime he was consumed with
an overpowering curiosity on the
subject of the telephone call ben-
dick had received at his apartment
something quite obviously was on
the verge of happening and since
the telephone call had been made
from waverly place and greene
street only a few blocks from
norths apartment he decided to
saunter over that way perhaps he
could pick up a description of the
person who made the call

  north walked across washington
square and turned into waverly
place a block ahead he saw the
lights of a store front reflected on
the wet sidewalk-probably the
place he was seeking approaching
he saw it was a drug store as he
entered he noticed casually that a
big limousine was stopped beyond
the corner on the other side of the
street

  yes sir said the sleepy clerk
expectantly

  north did not reply he was look-
ing over the clerks shoulder look-
ing beyond a display of cough medi-
cine and hot-water bottles through
the window he saw a man get out
of the limousine and walk rapidly
down the street the man was wear-
ing a soft felt hat of pearl gray and
a light-colored overcoat pinched
sharply at the waist-inappropriate
costume for a cold wet night north
thought he had had only a brief
glimpse of the mans face-a dark
rather handsome face-but there was
something decidedly familiar about
it

  what can i do for you sir
asked the clerk again

  gimme two nickels for a dime
said north i want to phone

  please dont talk too long sir
said the clerk its midnight
were closing

  north paused at the entrance to
                    com-a
fog over the river



the telephone booth frowning he
didnt want to telephone he wanted
to remember where he had seen the
man in the pearl-gray hat suddenly
he swore violently and dashed from
the drug store

  monzello frank monzello the
fish-market racketeer thats who it
was north had seen monzello only
once for a very short time several
months ago but he was certain that
this man was monzello what was
monzello doing in greenwich vil-
lage what was he doing as a mat-
ter of fact in new york bendick
had said he was on the schooner
spray and was not due back until
to-morrow morning bendick must
be lying but would bendick lie
and jeopardize the five thousand dol-
lars that he was obviously planning
to use to make a get-away

  north reached the corner the
limousine was gone he looked
down waverly place toward the
square then toward broadway
monzello had vanished there was
no one in sight in greene street in
either direction north hesitated
it seemed a hopeless task hunting a
man alone when he wasnt even sure
where he had vanished it was a
shame to let hoag in on this but that
seemed the only thing to do he ran
back to the drug store

  the clerk was putting out the
lights the door was locked north
pounded on the glass the clerk
formed silent words with his lips to
the effect that the store was closed
north made signs with his foot that
he intended to kick the glass out of
the door the clerk opened north
bounded into the telephone booth
and called hoag

  vincent he said ive just seen
frank monzello

  youre drunk north said hoag

  all right said north if you
dont want to-

 com- a

  wait dont hang up north
said hoag whered you see him

  north told him

  ill be right down said hoag

  north hung up the receiver and
walked out of the store the clerk
appeared greatly relieved

north went to the corner and
looked in all directions it
would be five perhaps ten
minutes before hoag showed up-
too long to stand on a street corner
on a night as cold as this north
knew of a speakeasy just across the
way in washington square he
would have time for one drink be-
fore hoag showed up he pulled
his hat down and started walking

  just before he reached the square
he stopped short he heard two
sharp explosions like two pistol
shots in quick succession the re-
ports had come from behind him-
from the direction of greene street
he turned and retraced his steps
half running past the drug store
now dark to the corner

 he looked up and down greene
street he saw no one he walked
quickly in one direction for half a
block decided he was wrong walked
a block in the other direction again
he was about to stop when he saw a
flickering lurid light shining in a
driveway he turned in across a
small courtyard he saw flames danc-
ing madly in a second-story window
he ran to the door of the building
tried to open it it was locked

  he hurried back to the corner and
turned in a fire alarm

  half a minute later lieutenant
hoag drove up

  north told hoag what he had seen
and heard-carefully omitting the
prelude of bendicks visit and the
dialogue with rustaff on the stairs
these were two angles which he
could use to his own advantage later


street  smiths complete stories

  so you think the shots came from
inside there said hoag as north
hurried him to the burning loft
building

  thats my guess said north

 heres the fire wagons said
hoag an the first trucks screeched
to a stop outside in greene street
disgorging squads of men in rubber
helmets while the first hoses were
being unreeled hoag got hold of a
battalion chief

 can you send anybody inside
ed asked hoag

  the battalion chief stopping in
the driveway appraised the headway
made by the blaze he shook his
head

 dangerous he said and use-
less theres nobody in a loft build-
ing at this time of night

 there might be said hoag i
want to make sure

 well- began the battalion

chief he turned his head to shout
an order fire axes smashed through
the door on the far side of the court-
yard six men dragged a squirming
nozzle across the sidewalk through
the arch a battering-ram of water
leaped roaring into the flaming stair-
way hissing clouds of smoke rolled
out driving hoag and north back
to the street

 more nozzles were coming into
play two men with gas masks and
hand extinguishers ran into the
driveway the beams of their flash-
lights crisscrossed in the heavy
smoke as they moved toward the
door of the stairway

hoag was standing in the
street looking up suddenly
he dug his elbow into
norths ribs

  there he is he exclaimed

 who asked north

  the bird i been looking for said
hoag drawing his gun

 through a rift in the smoke
screen the face of phil collins was
clearly visible peering over the
parapet of the roof

  collins bellowed hoag col-
lins come on down that fire escape
or ill plug you

  collins promptly disappeared
hoag ran across the street he
wanted to go up the fire escape up
the extension ladder that was being
raised against the front of the build-
ing the battalion chief would hear
of no such foolhardy behavior
climbing around on burning build-
ings is reserved exclusively for
members of the fire department

  then the two firemen wearing gas
masks reemerged from the smoke-
filled stairway one of them was
staggering under a heavy burden-
the inert figure of a man slung across
his shoulders he made his way to-
ward the street deposited his burden
face down on the wet sidewalk and
snatched off his gas mask north
and hoag were beside him the
body clad in charred rags was dis-
colored and steaming

  looks like hes done for said
the fireman hes burned bad we
found him on the second-floor land-
ing probably overcome by the
smoke

  smoke hell exclaimed hoag a
flashlight in his hand hes been
shot look here the luminous
disk of his flashlight encircled two
gory wounds at the back of the mans
skull bullets had torn into the base
of the brain

 flop him over said north

lets see who-

  the fireman raised the body and
turned it over hoags light ex-
plored the dead mans features

  good heavens exclaimed north
as he recognized the contorted face
bendick

  a succession of pictures flashed
fog over the river



through norths mind he saw
frank monzello getting out of a
limousine and walking rapidly down
greene street a few moments before
he heard the shots that must have
killed bendick he saw louis rus-
taff standing in a darkened hallway
just outside norths door while ben-
dick inside was bargaining to sell
the inside story of the daggett
murder for five thousand dollars
and looking down again he saw
bendick dead

  he heard lieutenant hoag shout-
ing orders

  phone headquarters the lieuten-
ant was telling the uniformed police-
man who had come with him get
me fifty men get me another fifty
-or all they can spare-from the
mercer street station get em
quick im going to search every
building in six blocks ill be
damned if this collins is going to
get away from me this time

chapter xix

prisoners

the man in the pearl-gray hat
herded collins and june
lawn to the end of the alley
then suddenly extended his arm and
brushed them back a police car
whizzed by siren screaming

  june lawn gave a little cry but
the sound was lost in the howl of the
siren

  the man in the pearl-gray hat ad-
ministered a smack to the girls
mouth with the back of his hand

  a movement of resentment from
collins brought a sharp jab in the pit
of the stomach with the muzzle of
the mans revolver

  the police car swung around the
corner into greene street

  run ordered the man in an un-
dertone and dont make me shoot
off no guns

  they ran down the street around
the corner away from the fire with
the menace of the man with the re-
volver one pace behind them
straight ahead was the trestle of the
elevated turning out of third
street under the trestle a big
limousine was waiting the engine
running

  get in ordered the man in the
pearl-gray hat

 they obeyed the man got in
after them and sat on one of the
jump seats facing them with his
revolver on one knee

  without another word the limou-
sine started the chauffeur had evi-
dently been given previous orders
the car sped down west broadway
under the elevated trestle weaving
in and out among the steel pillars
for a few blocks then darting east-
ward into a side street

  i guess you folks never heard of
frank monzello said the man with
the revolver

  there was a brief silence then
june lawn said

  ive never heard anything good
about him

  the man chuckled in the dark-
ness

  just remember that girlie he
said next time you feel like scream-
ing

  youre monzello

  youre a good guesser girlie as
well as a good-looker

  what do you want with us de-
manded collins

  monzello chuckled again

  youll find out buddy he said
theres no hurry we got half the
night ahead of us and the nights is
getting pretty long now

  the limousine was threading the
streets of the lower east side pass-
ing the ramp of the williamsburg
bridge then the manhattan bridge
it stopped in a poverty-stricken


street  smiths complete stories

neighborhood that was in distinct
contrast to the gleaming magnifi-
cence of the sleek automobile the
chauffeur stuck his head out looked
up and down the street then got out
and opened the door

  hop ordered monzello and
dont forget girlie that my trigger
finger gets twitchy when anybody
screams or makes a fuss

  he marched collins and the girl
up one flight of steps at the point of
his gun

  when will you want the car
again sir called the chauffeur
from the foot of the stairs

  have it outside to-morrow night
at eleven unless you hear from me
in the meantime said monzello
just leave it ill drive it myself
you can pick it up again at the dock
at midnight

  monzello kicked at the door a
small panel opened at the height of
his eyes a womans face appeared
then vanished the door opened
monzello pushed collins and june
lawn ahead of him into the room
the door slammed shut with a me-
tallic clang collins noted that the
inside of the door was armored with
a thin plate of steel

  whats this you are bringing
home demanded the woman in a
bored disagreeable voice her face
heavily enameled in an attempt to
hide the advance of middle age still
showed substantial remains of a cer-
tain hard beauty her blond hair
was dark at the roots

  just friends said monzello go
on to bed while i talk to em

  the blonde looked at june lawn
talk if you want she said
but i aint going to bed im stay-
ing right here

  monzello shrugged from an or-
nate box he extracted a long rus-
sian cigarette that smelled sweetly
of amber as he bent his head to

light it the flame glinted on his
dark burnished hair the blonde
sat down sullenly at a table and re-
sumed a game of solitaire she had
been playing when monzello came
in

collins looked around the
room at the furnishings of
outmoded elegance-at red
plush furniture a big gilt-framed
mirror over the marble mantelpiece
a big clock surmounted by bronze
nymphs

  fix us a drink said monzello
its a cold night

  fix it yourself said the blonde
without looking up from her cards

  monzello produced a bottle and
three glasses

  lets get down to business mon-
zello said collins suddenly what
do you want with us

  monzello ignored the question
he pushed a glass toward june
lawn

  how about you girlie he asked
its a cold night

  none for me said the girl

  monzellos heavy eyelids closed
then slowly opened he poured him-
self a stiff drink of whisky gulped
it collins came close to him

  monzello if you dont-

  just whatll you do asked mon-
zello putting down his glass col-
lins met the challenge of his gaze
without blinking

  sit down said monzello and
ill tell you the story i was watch-
ing you two coming over the roofs
down in greene street after the fire
started and i figured you must have
seen some interesting things in that
old loft building what was you
two doing in that building anyhow
that you had to run away over the
roofs

  none of your business said col-
lins
fog over the river



  never mind said monzello i
got ways of making you answer in
case i really want to but all i want
to know is how much you saw of the
murder

  murder june lawn looked at
collins we heard shots but we
didnt see any murder

  thats fine girlie said mon-
zello murder aint a nice thing for
a girl like you to see but as far
as im concerned you saw it all
right and youre going to write
down just what you saw-like i tell
it to you

  we didnt see a thing said col-
lins

  i guess you know said mon-
zello bringing pen ink and paper
out of a drawer that the building
you was in belongs to a man named
wight-william wight

  yes admitted june lawn

  and of course you know what
wight looks like

  the girl nodded

  you too bud

  ive seen him said collins
fine said monzello dipping the
pen into the inkwell now you just
write how you saw william wight
shoot a man named bendick while
you was in that loft building

  but we didnt see any such
thing protested the girl

  maybe you dont know bendick
then just write you saw wight
shoot a man of such-and-such de-
scription ill tell you what bendick
looked like

  for all i know wight wasnt
anywhere near greene street to-
night said the girl

  that dont make no difference
you just write what i tell you ill
get a notary to make an affidavit
out of it and maybe you wont even
have to swear it in court

  you cant make us swear to any-
thing we didnt see said collins

  monzello poured himself another
drink

  you was seen in or about that loft
building said monzello narrowing
his eyes or you wouldnt have been
in such a hurry to get away did the
cops see you

  collins did not reply

  they did said monzello smil-
ing at his cigarette the cops saw
you fine then your storyll stand

up as an eye-witness account-

  were not going to perjure our-
selves collins announced

  sorry bud said monzello but
thats the way it is youre going
to write just what i tell you

  and if i dont

  youll stay here till you do said
monzello both of you and i got
ways and means of changing your
mind

collins yawned and stood
up better show us where
we sleep he said i have
an idea well be here for some days
all right if you want to sleep
over it said monzello youll
think better in the morning you
can sleep in here buddy

  he walked to a door and threw it
open

  and as for you girlie- mon-
zello stepped up to june lawn and
stood looking down at her

  june stood up facing monzello
monzello caught her in his arms
then released her suddenly he
stepped back blood oozing from a
long scratch on his cheek

  the blonde who had opened the
door for them was watching with a
playing card poised in mid-air be-
tween two fingers

leave her alone frank she
drawled youre too old for that
monzello was patting his wounded
cheek with a silk handkerchief his
eyes were blazing


street  smiths complete stories

  all right he said his voice tight
with anger then youll both sleep in
there

  but i want to sleep alone pro-
tested june i-

  youll sleep where i tell you
snapped monzello

  abruptly he picked up the girl in
his arms carried her struggling
through the door and flung her on
the bed he turned collins was
advancing on him fists clenched

  monzello flashed his gun

  get in there he ordered

 you--

  get in there

  collins looked over monzellos
shoulder the bored blonde had re-
sumed her game of solitaire and was
no longer watching collins backed
into the bedroom monzello pulled
the door closed with a bang and
locked it

  collins groped for the light
switched it on june was lying on
the bed where she had fallen sob-
bing collins went to the only win-
dow in the room tugged at it the
window went up with a screech he
put his hand out his fingers
touched the freezing cold of metal
iron shutters were closed over the
outside of the window and fastened
with a chain and padlock they
were prisoners for certain

  he went back to the girl sobbing
on the bed and touched her timidly
on the shoulder

  dont worry he said it isnt
that bad

  the girl looked at him and tried
to smile

  im sorry she said this is
stupid of me but-

  good night said collins

  he took off his coat rolled it into
a semblance of a pillow and lay
down on the floor it was cold he
pulled a rug over him the rug was
dusty he sneezed he was too ex-

cited to sleep anyhow he lay
awake thinking listening

  after a while he heard monzellos
voice in the next room monzello
was evidently talking on the tele-
phone collins made out snatches
of the one-sided conversation

 -better come through   
you can tell him that ive got two
witnesses wholl swear he was the
one that killed bendick    sure
tell him they were seen near the
crime so therell be no question
about em being eye-witnesses   
no he wont get to em he cant
anyhow im going to keep em in
a safe place    yeah im tak-
ing em to sea    the spray
to-morrow night    o k call
me during the day by

  collins heard the click of the re-
ceiver being replaced he heard the
drawling voice of the blonde com-
plaining about something then
followed a long silence broken only
by the soft sound of the snow falling
against the iron shutters

chapter xx

the morgue revisited

dark circles appeared under
the eyes of lieutenant vin-
cent hoag he had been up
most of the night and he had accom-
plished little he was as far as ever
from the solution of the murder of
harry daggett the murder of ar-
thur bendick in the greene street
loft building the night before had
eliminated one of the suspects but
had not helped clear up the original
mystery as hoag had hoped it
might there were clews but they
were conflicting

  there was the business of frank
monzello being seen in greene
street by north just before the fa-
tal shots were fired that would be
simple enough were it not compli-
fog over the river



cated by that brief view of phil col-
lins on the roof of the burning build-
ing what was collins doing there
anyhow if monzello killed bendick
and this man hartford too

  hoags men had found hartford ly-
ing on the top floor of a building half
a block from the fire white-lipped
with the pain of a broken ankle he
had fallen through a skylight ob-
viously while trying to get away
over the roofs hoag had gone to
bellevue hospital where hartford
was taken and had questioned him
for an hour he had gotten only in-
coherent answers-deliberately in-
coherent hoag suspected he was
sure that he could break hartford
down in the end but the doctors
wouldnt let him talk any more pa-
tient was in no condition for further
questioning at present

  then there was this fact of the
loft building belonging to william
wight lieutenant hoag refused to
accept this as a mere coincidence
he had gone to vandoria apart-
ments at three in the morning after
the deputy fire marshal had notified
him that the building was wights
he had gotten wight out of bed
strange-looking man with his long
white hair sticking out in all direc-
tions and his bushy black eyebrows
wight seemed very much upset
more by the murder than by the fire
he could understand the fire-if
hoag had seen collins on the roof
of the building collins blamed
wight for losing him his job at the
vandoria apartments he also re-
sented wights interfering in his
romance with june lawn quite
probably collins who doubtless
knew from june lawn that wight
owned  greene street had set
it ablaze from sheer spite but the
murder-wight was nonplused he
did not even know bendick

  as for the widow daggett she

had been in custody for twenty-four
hours without being of the slightest
help she was stupid or afraid

  lieutenant hoag heaved a puzzled
sigh clasped his hands in front of
his ample stomach and put his feet
up on his desk then his telephone
bell rang it was the desk sergeant
calling a taxi driver had some-
thing to say about the daggett mur-
der

  send him up said hoag

 the taxi driver was a small
spindly-legged man with dark jowls
and a long nose he played nerv-
ously with his cap as he spoke

  i been readin about this daggett
murder in the papers he said and
i guess maybe i should a come
around before but-well in the first
place i wasnt quite sure and in the
second place i was kind of scared of
losin my hackin badge on account
of gettin mixed up in a mess like
this even if it wasnt my fault last
night i talked it over with the old
lady and she says sure i should tell
you everythin i know

 what do you know asked
hoag leaning back in his chair

  first of all is this bird daggett
buried yet

  not yet said hoag the widow
wanted to bury him herself but
theres some hitch about the insur-
ance money so were planting him
in potters field for the time being
theres a boat load of stiffs going
up to the island to-morrow dag-
getts in the morgue till then

  can i go over and look at him
asked the taxi driver

  well go together hoag replied

ten minutes later hoag and
the taxi driver were walking
down the silent aisles of the
morgue stepping softly between the
row after row of still sheeted forms
an odor of death mingled with the


street  smiths complete stories

heavy smell of disinfectant they
stopped in front of one slab while
an attendant drew back the covering
from harry daggetts body the
taxi driver stared down for fully
half a minute as though fascinated
by the greenish pallor of the dead
face at last he said in a strangled
voice

  thats him

 know him asked hoag who
had been watching every change in
the taxi drivers expression

  no said the taxi driver but i
drove him-the night he was killed
whered you drive him to de-
manded hoag

  lets get outa here said the
taxi driver this place gives me
the jitters

  the attendant drew the covering
back over daggetts corpse hoag
and the taxi driver left the morgue

  whered you drive him to re-
peated hoag as the two men were
seated in the car returning to po-
lice headquarters

  ill start at the beginnin said
the taxi driver i just put down a
sailor in south street and im cruis-
in back up through the east side to

my regular stand-

  when was this asked hoag
tuesday night and a fellow
comes out to the curb and hails me
he gives me a fat envelope in one
hand and a ten-spot in the other
listen what i tell you he says
your clock wont run up moren
two-three bucks so theres a juicy
tip in it for you but dont try to
cross me because i got the number

of your hack badge- 

  what sort of looking man was
this interrupted hoag

  all i remember is he was dark
and dressed pretty snappy con-
tinued the taxi driver had on a
light-gray hat deliver this en-
velope he says pick up the pas-

senger theyll turn over to you and
bring him down to the entrance to
the fulton street docks well im
damned if that envelope aint stuffed
with hundred-dollar bills i finds out
when i delivers it its bail for this
fellow daggett-the same guy i just
see in the morgue hes the pas-
senger i picked up

 and you took him to fulton
street dock

  not right off this fellow dag-
gett insists on makin a stop on the
way im a little nervous on account
of him just gettin outa jail so i
dont argue i stops its the office

of a bail-bond broker-

  louis rustaff

  thats the name on the window
a short plump man kind of
bald

  thats him well i gets outa the
cab and looks through the window
i see daggett talkin kind of ex-
cited to rustaff only i cant see
rustaff very well on account hes
part hid behind a screen they talks
for about five minutes then rus-
taff comes out alone who told you
to bring this man here he asks he
told me hisself i says im sup-
posed to take him to the fulton
street docks tell him to come out
im in a hurry i says well rus-
taff goes back and him and daggett
argues about five minutes more
then daggett comes out and gets in
the cab drive to the vandoria
apartments next he says well i
dont want to get in bad with the
guy that give me the ten bucks
since he got my number and at the
same time i dont want no argument
with this guy daggett that just got
outa jail so i says all right
only i dont drive to the vandoria
i drive to the fulton street dock
like im supposed to far as i go
i says when we get to the dock

fog over the river



 i

you want to go to the vandoria
well daggetts kind of sore but he

gets out-

  was the man in the gray hat
waiting for him asked hoag

  i dont see nobody around said
the taxi driver the last i see of
daggett hes walking down the
dock kind of talkin to hisself
and you didnt see him again
not till just now in the morgue
i forgot to tell you though that
just as im drivin away from this
rustaffs office i notice the lights
go out i looks back and i sees
rustaff come out run down the
street in the opposite direction and
hop in a cab

  did he follow you

  i aint sure i didnt notice
the police car stopped in front of
headquarters

  come on upstairs said lieuten-
ant hoag i want to talk to you
some more

  in hoags anteroom detective
hill was waiting hill was pos-
sessed of two virtues which to a po-
lice detective are more valuable than
intelligence good legs and the pa-
tience to run down clews by the
dogged process of exhaustive elimi-
nation

  i traced that hat lieutenant said
detective hill proudly

  what hat asked hoag his mind
filled with what he had just learned
from the taxi driver

  that battered derby you found
floating near the laughing girl
when daggetts body was discov-
ered said the detective

  whos is it asked hoag

  took me two days to run it
down said detective hill i
started at the factory in norwalk
traced it through the wholesaler job-
ber and retailer-

  whose hat was it hoag de-
manded

  it belonged to louis rustaff
said the detective

chapter xxi

clew in brooklyn

alight snow had been fall-
ing all day roofs elevated
railway stations and the tops
of street cars were white but on the
ground the snow had melted to a
dirty slush some of it clung to jim
norths shoes whereupon hoag ob-
jected to the reporter putting his
feet on his official desk it was
eight oclock friday evening and the
first time that north had seen hoag
since the murder in greene street
the night before

  this is friday vincent said
north i want to start on my va-
cation to-morrow night are we
going to get the daggett murder
solved and off of page one
lieutenant hoag begged the ques-
tion

  i see where that cheap sheet of
yours is offering a thousand dollars
reward for the arrest of frank mon-
zello said hoag

  i thought you never read the
tabloid vincent

  i dont somebody told me
well monzello was in town last
night all right said north i
checked at the fulton street docks
this morning when the spray came
in the skipper of the spray says
monzello forced his way aboard at
the point of a pistol and then used
the same argument to get himself
transferred at sea to a schooner due
back in port yesterday morning
think he came back to kill ben-
dick

  maybe said north

  whatever he came back for said
hoag you can figure on paying that
thousand to somebody in the police
department


street  smiths complete stories

 got monzello cornered vin-
cent

  not exactly said hoag but we
got a tip to-day about the automobile
he drives we got a description and
license number the boys are comb-
ing the garages and the numbers
gone out over the state police tick-
ers here and in j ersey ill probably
have news on it before long

  probably not said north un-
less you do better than youre doing
on louis rustaff

 what about rustaff

 cant find him can you vin-
cent

  who said i was looking for rus-
taff

 you got new warrants out for
him charging murder and conspir-
acy you didnt expect to keep that
a secret did you

  i suppose you know where he is
said hoag deprecatingly

 i know where he isnt said
north i know his office has been
locked up tighter than a drum all
day

 what else you know

  i might tell you said north if
you told me on what information you
got those new warrants issued for
rustaff to-day

  cant said hoag confidential
information

 my informations confidential
too said north he got up and
reached for the lieutenants box of
cigars but hoag pushed his drawer
shut just in time north nonchal-
antly lighted one of his own ciga-
rettes ill be seeing you vin-
cent he said as he sauntered to-
ward the door dont disappoint
me on my vacation

 north went out to get something
to eat as he ate he consulted a
map of brooklyn he had bought at a
corner news stand

 he was a native new yorker but

he hadnt crossed the bridges to
brooklyn more than a dozen times in
his life to-night however he too
was looking for louis rustaff hed
been looking for him ever since he
had drawn his own conclusions from
rustaffs possible eavesdropping on
bendicks dicker to sell his confes-
sion and bendicks murder less than
an hour later north thought he was
nearer to knowing rustaffs present
whereabouts than lieutenant hoag
was north had spent an hour or
two in friendly inquiry among rus-
taffs fellow bail-bond brokers he
found them remarkably ignorant of
rustaffs movements-all except one
one broker owed north a debt of
gratitude for a previous favor and
even he was remarkably cautious
he thought-he wasnt in the least
sure-that rustaff might be found
in a certain street in brooklyn he
didnt know the number he wasnt
even sure of the street and natu-
rally north was to forget imme-
diately where he got this bit of
meager information

when he had finished eat-
ing north took a taxi
across brooklyn bridge
he found the street eventually but
it was a long street lined with
houses hopelessly alike he drove
up and down the street several times
without seeing anything that might
be a clew to rustaffs hiding place
then he dismissed the taxi and
started walking he might have a
better chance on foot

  he had been walking for nearly an
hour and had almost despaired of
finding anything significant when he
heard a dog scratching and whining
at the front door of a house as
north approached he saw the dog
leave the porch and run around the
side of the house he followed and
found the dog scratching at the back
fog over the river



door the dog growled scooted be-
tween norths legs and returned to
the front porch

  here by the faint light from the
street lamp at the corner north
thought he recognized the black
cocker spaniel he had taken from
the launch laughing girl the morn-
ing of the daggett murder nearly
three days ago it was undoubtedly
a black cocker spaniel but it was in
pitiful condition-bedraggled ob-
viously exhausted its paws bloody
as though worn down by days of
running its tongue hanging out its
coat matted north spoke to the
animal the dog turned wagged its
tail briefly in recognition of a famil-
iar voice then returned to the busi-
ness of scratching at the door
elated at having found its way home
after wandering the streets for
forty-eight hours the dog was baf-
fled by its inability to get into the
house

  north picked the dog up in his
arms and rang the doorbell after
a long wait the door was opened by
a japanese butler the japanese
looked at north looked at the dog
then said very sorry nobody
home

  he tried to close the door but
north had his foot inside

  tell mr rustaff he said that
north of the tabloid wants to see
him

  very sorry began the japanese
nobody-

  north put his shoulder against the
door and forced his way in

  tell mr rustaff repeated
north raising his voice that north
of the tabloid is here on a friendly
and unofficial visit but that if he
wont see me ill get the police and
hell wish he had

 very sorry-

  tell him what i told you roared
north

  the japanese disappeared a mo-
ment later he was back

  please to come he said

iouis rustaff met north
with a glass in his hand he
was standing none too stead-
ily behind a table strewn with ashes
and cigar butts his eyes were
bloodshot and he was apparently
half drunk

  north let the dog out of his arms
the spaniel ran for rustaff whin-
ing trembling and squirming with
delight trying to jump upon him
rustaff ignored the dog he stared
at north

  well he said

  i thought youd like to know
rustaff said north that theres a
warrant out charging you with con-
spiracy and murder

  moider at last rustaff looked
at the dog he put down a hand to
pet it the spaniel licked his fingers
eagerly and i suppose this dog
is evidence against me-that it

  youd have a hard time denying
the dog was yours said north

  i havent seen the dog in two
months said rustaff

  i know said north bendick
said he was keeping him for you
at the same time a jury might
think that the dog being in the
launch where daggett was murdered
indicates that youd been there too
-particularly since bendick is
dead

  the dog lived in the launch said
rustaff

  which launch asked north
there were two exactly alike

  rustaff did not reply

  north sat down crossed his legs
and extended a hand across the table
rustaff remained standing

  ill try one of your cigars while
youre making up your mind said
north


street  smiths complete stories

  rustaff pushed the box of cigars
toward north

 why did you come here he de-
manded

 i wanted you to tell me about
harry daggett said north
daggett was a fool said rustaff
tell me said north lighting a
cigar you were the one who fixed
it for daggett to go to jail in place
of monzello werent you

 why should i tell you any-
thing

 because sooner or later youre
going to have to tell your story to
the cops and maybe to a jury and if
youre going to lie itll be good prac-
tice for you to lie to me first
rustaff looked down at the black
spaniel curled up contentedly at his
feet

  ill tell you the truth he said
with sudden resolution i swear
ill tell the truth

 dont strain yourself said
north tell me how monzello
knew about daggett

 monzello knew daggett went to
jail for bendick said rustaff it
was one of monzellos men that ben-
dick beat up that time one day
monzello came to me and said
louis i got a tip theyre going to
indict me for extortion but i aint
going to jail get that boob dag-
gett to be a ringer for me ill pay
him the same as bendick did
what did bendick pay him
ten dollars for every day he
stayed in jail i told monzello he
was crazy that it wouldnt work
twice he said to take a chance
since it was a different court and
anyhow daggett was such a dope
daggett was glad to make a little
more easy money so i fixed it for
him to get arrested in monzellos
place then the judge set bail at
twenty grand and daggett dumb as
he was got leary he didnt mind

going to jail for thirty days but
with a bond of twenty thousand dol-
lars he figured maybe he was due
for a couple of years up the river
and by the time he got out hed
have a hard time collecting any
money so he sent woid to me that
if i didnt get him out he was going
to squeal and spill the whole woiks
so you passed on the squawk to
monzello

rustaff hesitated then he
said

thats it i phoned mon-
zello and monzello said o k
louis leave it to me ill take care
of this daggett next i know dag-
gett was out on bail and come around
to see me in a taxi the dumb-belld
got wise all of a sudden when he
saw that when he threatened to
squeal somebody quick shelled out
twenty grand to get him out of the
cooler he figured that here was an
easier way to make money then go-
ing to jail hed just keep up threat-
ening to squeal-

  he tried to shake you down
asked north

  he sure did said rustaff per-
spiring profusely on his bald spot
i put him off i told him it was
monzello had the dough and he
ought to get it from monzello the
taxi driver said that he had orders
to take him to fulton street dock
anyway so i pushed him off that
way thats the last i saw of him
and what was the last you saw of
bendick

  rustaff paled

  w-who he stammered

 arthur bendick the man who
was killed last night half an hour
after he talked to me with you
snooping outside the door listening
rustaffs lips seemed stuck to his
teeth he had difficulty in opening
his mouth to form words
fog over the river



  i-i wasnt s-snooping he said
id just come to-to see you like
i said

  whered you go after you left my
place in such a hurry demanded
north

 why i-i came home here
you said you were going back to
your office you said there was a
man waiting for you there

  yes i know but the man didnt
wait

 who was the man

 who was- why-i-it was a

client that is it was a fellow
wanted me to get his brother out of
the can

  thats a lie

  you cant talk to me like that
whined rustaff in an unsuccessful
attempt to be pugnacious

  youve seen monzello since i saw
you last night

  no i swear i havent

  youve talked to him by tele-
phone then

  rustaffs lips worked but no
words came

 you know where he is said
north

  no said rustaff perspiration
streamed down his face

  all right said north getting up
i told you there was a new warrant
out for you if you dont tell me
where monzello is ill see that the
warrant is served on you in ten min-
utes

  rustaff made a move toward the
drawer of the table north promptly
upset the table crashing bottle and
glasses to the floor in a shower of
ashes and cigar butts he hurdled
the wreckage and pinioned rustaffs
arms he felt of rustaffs pockets
and armpits the bail broker was
not armed

  youre coming with me said
north well call on monzello to-
gether

 a torrent of words burst from
rustaffs white lips

 i cant-you cant make me do
that mr north you cant thats
moider moider mr north
theres been lots of murder
around here in the last few days
said north

  i cant take you to monzello mr

north i cant i-

 youre scared i know said
north scornfully all right ill
give you a break rustaff well
take a taxi you can stay outside
if the address aint right ill be back
pronto to let you know in my own
quaint way if it is and i dont
come right down in two minutes the
taxi driverll have orders to bring
you home again that ought to be
protection enough for you-if you
got half the guts of that little dog
of yours

 rustaff shook his head he
mopped his ashen face

 i- he began

  get your hat rustaff north or-
dered

 rustaff walked unsteadily from
the room north keeping a firm grip
on his arm

walrus sees things

ayor mike tossed another
piece of wood in the rusty
stove which was doing its
best to keep the nocturnal chill out
of his flimsy shack

 so you saw handsome hart-
ford asked the carpenter

 finally said mayor mike i
been hangin around the hospital
ever since i read about him in the
paper this mornin but they didnt
let me in until to-night i said i was

the carpenter


street  smiths complete stories

 he didnt want to mayor mike
replied him and that mrs dag-
getts afraid if they talk somethinll
happen to the baby i finally told
handsome that i had to know
whether him or spig was the one to
kick out of shantytown then he
gave me the whole story

 whatd he say

plenty said mayor mike i
promised handsome id keep my
mouth shut all i can say is that
spig is the one that gets booted out
where is spig anyhow

 he aint come back since last
night said mayor mike

  a breath of cold air on his back
caused mayor mike to turn around
he saw walrus stooping to enter
the shack melted snow glistened
on walruss mustaches and his eyes
were wide with excitement

 hey mayor he exclaimed
you read to-day where the tabloid
is offering a thousand dollars reward
for the arrest of frank monzello
walrus said mayor mike scorn-
fully you know i never read them
worthless newspapers

  but a thousand dollars mayor
said walrus and i know where
monzello is

  you know where he is
  walrus nodded violently

 when i went down to fulton
market for our free fish this after-
noon a fellow i know said one of his
regular men was sick and did i want
to work for a few hours packing
oysters i did all right just as i
was finishing work who did i see go
by but this monzello guy i saw him
go down the dock to talk to the skip-
per of the spray i waited and
when he came back i followed him
he walked about ten or fifteen
blocks taking side streets i saw

him go into a house-

 remember where it was wal-
rus demanded mayor mike

  couldnt miss it said walrus
theres a big auto in front of the
place

  why didnt you call the cops and
get the thousand bucks asked the
carpenter

 i wanted to see mayor mike
first said walrus and find out if
it would be getting any of the boys
in bad to have monzello pinched
mayor mike arose lighted his
corncob pipe and turned up his coat
collar

 come on walrus he said
lets go get monzello

 walrus and mayor mike walked
through the streets of the lower
east side except for a few desul-
tory flakes the snow had stopped
the slush on the sidewalks had
frozen and a thin coat of ice
crunched under their feet

 they turned into a dark street
walrus stopped and pointed

 there it is he whispered
theres the auto

 mayor mike drew walrus into a
doorway they were about thirty
yards from the car and across the
street

 whos that bendin down by the
wheels asked mayor mike it
looks like spig

  by jinks it is spig exclaimed
walrus under his breath damned
if it aint spig

  whats he doin to them wheels
muttered mayor mike whats he
got in that little can

  looks like hes doing something
on the brakes sure hes smearing
grease on the drums hell hes
greasing the brakes

 funny breathed mayor mike

what in hell-

  he stopped short a scream split
the night followed by the crack of
a shot muffled by walls running
feet clattered on the stairway of the
house across the street
fog over the river



  mayor mike saw spig go quickly
to the rear of the auto crouch close
to the gas tank and trunk rack to
avoid being seen

  two shadowy figures burst from
the doorway across the street then a
third mayor mike and walrus
watched motionless as though
frozen to the spot

at this very moment lieutenant
hoag was talking to william
 - wight who had walked into
police headquarters a moment be-
fore

  i was afraid i wouldnt find you
said wight sorry i couldnt get
here earlier but i just got your mes-
sage you wanted to see me about
something in particular

  yes said hoag i wanted to
find out what you knew of louis
rustaff

  rustaff wight shook his head
i dont recall ever having heard the
name

  hes a bail-bond broker the rea-
son i thought you might know him
is that a hat which we found be-
longs to him had the telephone num-
ber avenue - written in the
band with indelible pencil

  thats the number of the van-
doria said wight but its also the
number of some fifty other apart-
ments besides mine as a matter of
fact had you thought of connecting
that number with this chap collins
he was on duty at the switchboard
for several weeks you know

  id thought of him said hoag

and i-

  he paused in the middle of his
sentence a buzzer on his desk was
sounding insistently hoag reached
over and pushed a switch cutting in
a loud-speaker connected with the
short-wave radio station broadcast-
ing police alarms

  frank monzellos big limousine

spotted speeding down fulton
street droned the loud-speaker
exchanging running gun fire with
patrolman dunn in commandeered
taxi pursuing all radio patrol cars
in vicinity will proceed at once-

 hoag snapped off the switch and
stood up

 on our way he announced

  ill drop in again to-morrow if
youd like lieutenant said wight

 better come with me now said
hoag

 now

  come on said hoag

chapter xxiii

nightmare

phil collins and june lawn
spent most of the day in the
little room in which frank
monzello had locked them the night
before monzello had slept until
noon and had then recommenced his
efforts to get collins and the girl to
write statements purporting to be
eye-witness accounts of how wil-
liam wight had killed arthur ben-
dick when they persisted in their
refusal they were locked up again
until dark

 during the evening the bored
blonde brought them something to
eat and monzello resumed his bully-
ing-without results again they
were locked up

 toward midnight collins heard
the key turn softly in the lock the
door opened slowly the bored
blonde was standing there she
nodded at colins

  you drive a car she whispered

  yes said collins

  the blonde handed him a key

  franks taking a nap she said
the cars out in front take it and
beat it away from here as fast as you
can and dont forget to take your
girl friend with you
	street  smiths complete stories

  thanks- collins began tak-
ing the key

  dont thank me drawled the
blonde looking at june lawn i
aint being good to you im just
tired of seeing you around here

  collins hesitated a second

  isnt it dangerous he whis-
pered

  scared drawled the blonde

  for you-if he should wake up
collins explained

 i can handle him said the
blonde beat it

  collins and the girl tiptoed across
the room carefully avoiding the red
plush furniture they had almost
reached the door when a sharp voice
rang out behind them

  where you going

  collins turned his head he saw
monzello standing at the back of the
room his black hair towsled with
sleep

  collins pushed june toward the
door

  the brief thunder of a pistol shot
pounded his eardrums the shat-
tered fragments of the mirror in the
gilt frame crashed glittering to the
floor

  june screamed stumbled

  collins caught her in his arms
dashed to the stairway

  im all right let me down she
said in his ear

  they ran down the steps as they
neared the bottom collins heard
monzello clattering after them
shouting something

  collins leaped across the sidewalk
pulled open the door of the car
standing at the curb pushed the key
into the ignition lock the girl
jumped in beside him he stepped
on the starter the engine roared
into action

  monzello came out of the door-
way and jumped on the running
board pistol in hand the car

leaped ahead monzello opened the
rear door stepped inside pressed the
muzzle of his gun to the base of col-
linss brain

  drive where i tell you he or-
dered

  as the car picked up speed a long
strangled cry came from behind the
automobile monzello turned his
head nervously

  faster he ordered collins

  the cry seemed to be following
the car it mounted to a howl of
terror monzello craned his neck
but could not see the man who was
being dragged along behind

  spig crouching against the rear of
the car as collins came running out
of the house found his belt caught
in the rear bumper when the car sud-
denly leaped into motion he began
to howl when his effort to free him-
self proved hopeless

  turn right ordered monzello

  collins hesitated wondering if he
should risk going straight ahead
monzello jabbed the cold steel ring
of the gun muzzle painfully into
the back of his neck collins turned
right

f  nhe screaming at the rear of
the car became frantic yell-
ing spig had managed to
swing one leg up on the bumper but
he could not disentangle his belt
he was holding on with both hands
afraid of being mangled if he should
be dragged along the pavement at
the breathless speed the car was
making

  his yells were attracting attention
to the speeding car heads appeared
at windows a policeman came run-
ning to the corner shouting two
blocks away another policeman com-
mandeered a taxi and started in pur-
suit

  turn left ordered monzello

  the car careened on two wheels

com-a
fog over the river



tires moaning as it swung into ful-
ton street

  now open it wide commanded
monzello again jabbing his gun into
collinss neck

  the motor roared as the speedome-
ter needle climbed from sixty-five to
seventy seventy-five

  the taxi commandeered by the po-
liceman was a block behind its elec-
tric horn shrieking

  three shots cracked

  a spider web suddenly appeared
on the windshield in front of col-
lins as a bullet pierced the shatter-
proof glass

  monzello put his arm out the win-
dow and fired twice

 june lawn slumped low in her
seat beside collins paralyzed with
terror

  spig was still yelling from the
rear bumper

  faster ordered monzello again

  the speedometer needle showed
eighty-five miles an hour

  galvanized iron dock buildings
loomed ahead slightly to the right
was a high grilled gate

  a shot clanked through a fender

  monzello fired one more in reply

  through that gate he ordered
turning back to collins stop at
the end of the dock and jump in
the schooner to the right were
taking a sea trip

  the car flashed through the gate
collins took his foot from the ac-
celerator and applied the brakes
cautiously so as not to skid on the
wet pavement of the dock there
was no response then he jammed
his foot on the brake pedal as far as
it would go the car hurtled down
the dock unchecked

  slow up ordered monzello

  a cold nauseous feeling of help-
lessness surged up in collins his
scalp crawled he yanked back the
emergency brake to the last notch

 com-a

there was no change the brakes
were useless

  brakes spig screamed from the
rear bumper brakes

  the gleaming wet surface of the
dock flashed backward under the
madly racing car collins could see
the end of the pier rushing toward
him in the glare of the headlights
he saw masts bobbing against the
blackness of the water with night-
marish unreality

  stop stop shouted monzello

  collins did not take the time to
tell monzello that he couldnt stop
that the brakes wouldnt hold the
car was plunging toward the brink

  collins took his hands from the
wheel his feet from the pedals the
car swerved crashed through a stack
of fish baskets scattered them

  collins drew up his legs drove his
feet through the windshield

  the runaway car catapulted off
the end of the dock for a breath-
less second it seemed to hang in
mid-air the front wheels dropped
a great geyser of water sprang from
the surface of the east river as the
car disappeared the water poured
back with a prolonged splash

  the river boiled and bubbled for
an instant in a diffused greenish
submarine glow from the headlights
of the sunken car

  the glow dimmed then vanished

chapter xxiv

i killed him

the fulton street fish markets
swarmed with life at the first
glimmer of daylight the
steel spider web of brooklyn bridge
loomed black against the gray of
dawn on the river the towering
skyscrapers of lower manhattan the
usual background of the market
were lost in mists

  fishing schooners nosed out of

the murk their rigging covered with
ice their tiny square flags signals
of the catch frozen stiff among
the delivery wagons and ice trucks
awaiting the schooners this morning
were unfamiliar colors green police
cars a white ambulance a red fire
truck at the end of the dock the
portable crane of the police emer-
gency squad swung out over the wa-
ter was grappling for a sunken auto-
mobile some blue-coated policemen
moved among market men in hip
boots and leather aprons among sail-
ors whose icy oilskins crackled as
they walked

  several office rooms above the
markets had been converted into a
combination emergency hospital and
branch police station lieutenant
hoag sat near a stove near him
sat william wight yawning op-
posite were jim north and louis
rustaff who had come in at the tail
end of the chase of monzellos run-
away auto mayor mike and wal-
rus sat deferentially in the back-
ground they had arrived breath-
less after pursuing the car on foot

  in the next room doctors were
working using the pulmotor for an
hour they had pumped life back into
frank monzello he had suffered
the longest submersion he would
still be at the bottom of the river
had it not been for phil collins

  as the automobile struck the wa-
ter collins had dragged june lawn
through the broken windshield
pulled her to the surface swum with
her to the side of a schooner tied to
the dock then he dove found mon-
zello with a foot caught in the steer-
ing wheel and managed to pull him
free

  spig had been thrown clear by im-
pact with the water he had tried
hiding under the pier until the icy
water drove him out he was half
dead from exposure when he surren-

dered to the small army of police-
men gathered on the dock

  hoag was looking out the window
at the baskets of iced mackerel be-
ing carried across the street when
a doctor appeared in the doorway

  i think theyre all in condition to
talk now lieutenant said the doc-
tor shall i bring them in

  hoag nodded

  collins june lawn frank mon-
zello and spig came into the room
blue-lipped wrapped in blankets
hoag pointed to mayor mike
which is the man you say you
saw greasing the brakes on mon-
zellos car he asked

  the one on the right said mayor
mike his names spig

  how about it spig asked hoag
  spig said nothing

  he got took by surprise when
they came out continued mayor
mike and when the car started he
got tangled up in the back part-the
trunk rack

  why did you want monzello to
kill himself-which you must have
expected greasing his brakes
asked hoag

  spig looked at monzello his gaze
moved on to rustaff to wight then
to mayor mike he said nothing

  he was acting on orders said
monzello suddenly he got orders
from somebody else

  who asked hoag

  there was a silence

you know this man collins
yes said collins but i dont
know who gave him his orders

  do you know mr wight

  i havent the faintest idea
  how about you rustaff

  me how should i know i
dont know anything about this
spig you killed harry daggett
announced hoag

  i never did said spig speaking
for the first time
fog over the river



lieutenant hoag got up

gents he said i just
a learned from the mayor of
shantytown that on the night harry
daggett was murdered somebody
told mrs daggett in the dark where
she would find her husbands body
mrs daggett has been in the next
room listening to your voices she
thinks she might recognize the voice
she heard that night matron bring
in mrs daggett

  isabel daggett entered in custody
of a buxom police woman

  did you recognize the voice mrs
daggett

  i did said isabel daggett
thats the man

  without hesitation she pointed to
william wight

  thats preposterous said wight
crossing his legs

  no it aint said monzello sud-
denly youre sunk wight were
all sunk why dont you spill the
truth

  why would i want to kill dag-
gett-a man i didnt know insisted
wight

  ill tell you why declared mon-
zello im going to tell the truth
by rights im a dead man wight
id be a corpse at the bottom of the
river right now if it hadnt been for
this kid collins and since im alive
on a fluke im going to try to square
myself by telling the truth for once
the mans delirious lieutenant

and-

  first ill tell you why he hired
spig to grease my brakes monzello
continued he wanted to get rid
of me because i wanted to muscle in
on his racket i threatened him

with-

what racket interrupted hoag
hes a smuggler said monzello
hes been smuggling in hundreds
of thousands of dollars worth of
european lace every yeai getting

out of paying hundreds of thousands
of dollars worth of duty it was a
good game and when it looked like
i was going to have to retire from
the fish market racket for a while
i decided to get in on wights busi-
ness

  whats that got to do with harry
daggett

  ill tell you wight used to
smuggle in his lace by having men
in the crew of two or three trans-
atlantic liners the lace was packed
in water-tight cases that would float
when they got tossed overboard
about twenty miles offshore the
fishing schooner spray picked up the
floating boxes and transferred em
to the launch laughing girl thats
why there was two laughing girls
-so thered be an alibi in case one
of em got spotted at sea people
would swear they saw the laughing
girl in the sound that same day
well arthur bendick would land
the lace over on long island and
truck it over to that loft building
in greene street-

 so arthur bendick was in
wights employ

  thats not true

  sure its true monzello insisted
that time bendick got arrested for
assault he beat up one of my men
who tried to get on the inside of
this lace racket wight couldnt let
bendick go to jail because there was
a couple of lace shipments due in
the next few weeks and bendick
had to be on hand to pick em up
so he hired harry daggett to go
to jail in bendicks place and when
daggett got rambunctious and he
threatened to squeal six weeks later
wight killed him

  i got evidence monzello said
hoag that you were the one that
bailed daggett out the night he was
killed

  thats right said monzello i


street  smiths complete stories

bailed him out i was going to take
him out to sea where he couldnt
do no harm-maybe take him to
canada but wight got to him first

and-

  how did wight know daggett
was out of jail asked hoag

here was a long pause
finally rustaff piped up
im going to come clean
too he said wight knew all
right because when daggett got out
of jail he came to me and wanted
to shake wight down for a lot of
dough i telephoned wight wight
said nothing doing but i told him
that daggett was on his way to see
monzello at the fulton street dock
i followed i saw daggett and
wight arguing together i tried to
argue with daggett and he hit me

he knocked my hat off i ran-

  how about it wight

  william wight suddenly col-
lapsed in his chair as though he
were a balloon that had been punc-
tured he made a feeble gesture

  all right since youre all squeal-
ers-ill confess i killed him
there was a moment of deep si-
lence

  id been worried for weeks he
continued his booming voice had
sunk to little more than a whisper
his face was haggard i made a
mistake in hiring this man daggett
i found out he was stupid a stupid
man is dangerous i became almost
panicky when i discovered that
hartford had taken such an interest
in mrs daggett and was digging for
details i knew hartford had found
my lace stores and that he was steal-
ing from them to sell on fourteenth
street but i could do nothing with-
out exposing myself then i hired
spig to watch hartford and found
he lived in shantytown the night
daggett was bailed out spig told

me that mrs daggett had come to
shantytown then when rustaff
phoned that daggett was after
money i knew the end had come
when a stupid man goes in for
blackmail he becomes a perpetual
danger

 so you rushed down to head him
off at the fulton docks

 yes i was afraid he and mon-
zello would gang up against me i
didnt intend to kill him at first it
was only after rustaff had come and
gone-leaving his hat behind-that
i decided to commit murder i took
daggett aboard the laughing girl
which was tied up near the dock
with engine trouble i took rus-
taffs hat along for a false clew i
knew that bendick kept a shotgun
in the cabin i saw that the tide was
coming in i told daggett a story
about the money being aboard the
boat he followed me i killed him

  then i drifted up as far as shan-
tytown and anchored i intended
the body to be a warning to hart-
ford and mrs daggett i thought
that rustaffs hat and dog would
turn suspicion from me-particu-
larly since the launch was registered
in bendicks name then i lost my
head i suspected everybody i
thought when collins came back to
the vandoria he knew something
i was afraid that hartford or mrs
daggett might talk after all i had
spig carry off the baby knowing
then that mrs daggett and prob-
ably hartford wouldnt talk as long
as they thought the baby was a host-
age but there was still collins and
miss lawn i decided to wipe out
everything-the lace the loft build-
ing prospective witnesses against
me spig was to get the people into
the building bendick was to block
their escape burn the building-

 whyd you kill bendick asked
hoag
fog over the river



  because rustaff heard bendick
getting ready to squeal volunteered
jim north

  thats right rustaff phoned me
said wight

  rustaff is a damned accommodat-
ing guy said monzello he wants
to please all his customers-speci-
ally them hes afraid of rustaff
told me after a lot of coaxing with
gold and steel that there was things
happening in greene street thurs-
day night thats why i was there
i saw wight go in and come out i
didnt see him kill bendick but i
guessed it thats why i carried off
these two youngsters i wanted to
use em as a club over wight

  and thats why wight sent spig
to grease your brakes

  ask spig said monzello
thats right grunted spig
wights been paying me
wheres my baby asked isabel
daggett

  the kids all right said spig
sullenly i parked him in a nur-
sery you can get him back to-day
well i guess that washes up
everything said lieutenant hoag
with a touch of pride ill get a
release for mrs daggett after break-
fast and wight rustaff spig and
monzello can have breakfast at the
tombs how about that thousand
dollars reward the tabloid was of-

fering for the capture of monzello
north

  i guess this chap collins gets it
said north he was the one that
fished monzello out of the river by
the collar

 a thousand dollars june lawn
beamed on collins what will you
do with all that money phil
maybe mayor mike can use some
of it to buy stoves and extra blankets
for shantytown said collins and
maybe a few beefsteaks to change
off from fish chowder

  lieutenant hoag wen over to jim
north and slapped the reporter re-
soundingly on the back

 well north he exclaimed i
told you wed have this mystery all
cleared up so you could leave for
your vacation on time getting away
to-night

  soon as my storys in type said
north im pulling out for florida
i need a change im fed up on this
confounded routine i crave excite-
ment

 north was standing at the win-
dow in the street below tons of
fish were being packed in barrels of
ice tubs of eels were being loaded
into a truck

  and what are you going to do in
florida for change and excitement
asked lieutenant hoag

  im going to fish said north

                          

a garden duel

a davenport iowa garden was the scene of one of the strangest
battles nature has ever staged a snail and a twenty-inch garter
snake engaged in a duel which strange as it may seem resulted in
the death of the snake quite early in the contest the snail got a hold on
the snake which it never relinquished and as the battle waged on the snail
worked the head of its victim into its shell the snakes writhings became
weaker and weaker then stopped altogether leaving the snail a champion
in the garden pool


an
unofficial
deportation

va swell feed swell liquor and a swell fight

krom the veranda of the
shabby little hotel du
commerce jerry harper
watched a tramp steamer
entering the harbor of
port des galets it crept up to the
pier behind the fortnightly mail
boat the hoarse blast of its whis-
tle was heard jerrys thin face was
wreathed in smiles

  shes in he exclaimed a real
yank ship and when she jerks her
hook theres going to be a couple
more real yanks aboard-you and
me

  bill costigan gave no sign that
he was aware of the ship or of his
friends words he was reclining in
a chair hat tilted over one eye
sharp jaw resting on chest costi-
gan was tall broad-shouldered and
muscular while harper was small
and wiry they were likewise op-
posites in temperament costigan
was hot-headed and impulsive with
a chip forever on his shoulder har-
per was very cool and calculating

  wake up urged harper impa-
tiently shes in i tell you and
as pretty a job of berthing as i ever
an unofficial deportation



saw slick it was the way she
came into this trick harbor
without moving his head costi-
gan opened his unobstructed eye and
cocked it coldly upon jerry harper

  how the hell did you expect it
to come in-roll over on its side or
jump in backward

  a neat job harper insisted
then thrust out his jaw and de-
clared were leaving reunion
island on that ship

  we are not costigan disagreed
promptly and decisively ive told
you a dozen times i dont budge off
this island until the authorities de-
clare me an undesirable alien and
deport me-passage paid youre
worse than crazy if you think im
going to work my way out ive
done all the work im going to do
in this part of the indian ocean if
i ever lift a finger around here
again itll be to knock briffault for
a double loop now shut up and let
me sleep

  whereupon costigans one visi-
ble eye closed again his attitude
while startling was not entirely un-
justified at least from his point of
view when the two americans had
wandered into port des galets cos-
tigan had secured a job as overseer
of a coffee plantation with typi-
cal yankee energy he had driven
himself driven the natives and had
ended by trying to drive the indo-
lent owner it was simply not the
way of things in the island as the
owner briffault had explained

 you work too hard he said
wearily even the sight of you
tires me go where such talent is
appreciated my young friend and
leave me in peace just between
you and me i suggest you go to a
madhouse

costigans reply was unprintable
now briffault was a rich man
hence a man powerful in island poli-

tics and he was not accustomed to
being called hard names he
promptly had costigan arrested for
slander and the magistrate oblig-
ingly saw to it that costigan who
was unable to pay a fine was given
sufficient time to repent his impu-
dence

rtl hirty days is a long time
in port des galets while
costigan brooded them away
in jail harper grew unutterably
bored walking the streets he was
anxious to leave the island when
costigan was freed costigan how-
ever had other ideas as a sort of
protest gesture against the gross in-
justice that had been done him he
was determined to stay until de-
ported just how he was to make
himself obnoxious enough to achieve
that end without running the risk
of another jail sentence he did not
know but work his way out
never

  such very formidable stubborness
would have dismayed most men
but jerry harper had a good deal
of the same stuff in him his mind
was as firmly made up as costigans
and he meant to have his way so
while costigan dozed in his chair
harper made his way to the pier
where a small mountain of coffee
sacks was gradually vanishing into
the newcomers holds

  at close quarters the ship belied
her name of manhattan maid she
was in fact a distinctly frowzy old
lady from the tip of her blunt
nose to her tvisted taffrail she was
grimy with soot and raw with rust
harpers enthusiasm was somewhat
dampened as he visioned himself
scrubbing her scarred decks or chip-
ping and painting her battered
plates under a broiling tropic sun

  he had little time to reflect how-
ever a broad-shouldered indi-


street  smiths complete stories

vidual wearing an officers cap came
down the gangplank just then he
had a pug nose curly black hair
and forearms that an ape would have
envied harper stepped up to him
and touched his hat with two fin-
gers

  beg pardon sir he said with
just the right amount of humility
are you the captain of this ship

  the other took his pipe from his
mouth and eyed jerry harper from
head to foot and back again

  im the mate he said gruffly
what th hell do you want

 a job-

  no the mate shook his head
decisively no jobs see the con-
sul

  wait listen begged harper
and leaping in front of the mate he
launched into his story

 as with many men whom nature
has not favored with muscle and
brawn jerry harper was endowed
with nimble wits and a glib tongue
thus his story was a good one and
he knew how to tell it he stuck
to facts up to the point where cos-
tigan had been railroaded to jail
from then on his imagination came
into free play

  the jail moriorty-the mate at
this point admitted that was his
name-couldnt imagine what the
jail was like if the cells hadnt
been ten feet underground theyd
have crawled away for company
costigan had had half a dozen na-
tives murderers all whod nearly
killed him once big as he was the
food was so bad a starving ships cat
wouldnt have touched it but that
wasnt the worst of it upon his
release costigan had been ordered
to leave the island within three days
or he would be returned to jail for
a full year

  the three days are up to-night
said harper a note of desperation

coming into his voice if were
here in the morning theyll put us
both in jail we cant buy passage
on the mail boat and there isnt an-
other ship in the harbor youve
got to take us out

moriorty was scowling

darkly he was an amer-
ican by birth but an irish-
man at heart resistance to oppres-
sion and injustice was his heritage
even so there were certain practi-
cal aspects of the situation that had
to be considered and the mate
sucked at his pipe so long without
making any comment that jerry
harper became uneasy

  you cant let us down he
pleaded were fellow country-
men costigans an irishman too
this last pull at his irish heart-
strings was too much for the mate
he made up his mind abruptly

  ill do it ill take you out he
said i wouldnt sleep nights if i
thought id let them blasted frogs
lay you by the heels again bloods
thicker than water so it is

  the mate looked around then
pitching his voice to a confidential
whisper went on

  i tell you what were got a full
crew and i know the old man
wouldnt sign you on regular own-
ers would raise hell but there aint
nothin to keep you from stowin
aboard and turnin up when were at
sea the skipperll raise hell on
general principles when he finds
you but that wont matter ill ease
things along for you

  whats the skipper like har-
per inquired uneasily for he knew
from experience that a stowaways
life could be made very unpleasant

  he aint a bad sort a little bit
stiff in the neck at times but if you
handle him right he sails on an even
keel just jump when he gives the
an unofficial deportation



word and you get along with him all
right

  maybe id better talk to him
suggested harper doubtfully
where is he

  ashore and he wont be back un-
til about five minutes before sailing
time which is midnight hes a live
one the skipper is the mate
closed one eye in a ponderous wink
now heres the lay he went on
seriously you and your pal come
aboard along about eleven thirty i
wont be around to see you come
for i dont want no lies on my con-
science in the morning but ill tip
the watchman and hell show you
where to stow then lay low and
dont show your mugs till morning
see

  harpers display of gratitude was
so profuse that moriortys ears
turned red and he cursed roughly
to hide his confusion the mate
went about his business with a warm
feeling that he had served the two-
fold cause of charity and justice to
the best of his ability

  harper went off with his hands in
his pocket whistling briskly and
cheerfully

f  he st charles is not accord-

   ing to metropolitan stand-

  - ards a fine hotel it is how-
ever the best in port des galets
and the one most in repute among
the towns elect twice a week they
come there to dine dance play
cards and exchange gossip it is
their clubhouse and like club-
houses everywhere it is exclusive
prices are high and strangers are
not cordially received unless they
appear to be somebody

  careless of these facts jerry har-
per and bill costigan boldly entered
the hotel grounds when the dinner
hour was in full swing they were
determined to dine in the best style

available and hang the expense
the reason for such a splurge was
the dissolution of their partnership
for harper had firmly declared his
intention to ship on the manhattan
maid whether or not costigan did
likewise

  they were still arguing the mat-
ter as they trudged up the drive

  i dont get your point at all
complained harper you said you
wouldnt work your way out all
right you dont have to ive fixed
it with the skipper to sign you on
as supercargo and me as relief wire-
less operator we wont have a lick
of work to do and well eat in the
officers mess to boot what more
do you want

  i want you to shut up about it
retorted costigan irritably ive
told you how i stand and thats
final if you want to go then go
no hard feelings about it you just
see it one way and i see it another
youre plain bullheaded pro-
tested harper

  costigan stopped and regarded his
companion severely

 nov listen runt he com-
manded i said there were no hard
feelings and i asked you up here
for a good-by feed to prove it im
paying the bill and i mean to en-
joy myself if youre going to
squawk all evening well call it off
make up your mind

  have it your own way bill
shrugged harper and sighed long
and deeply

  they approached the dining ve-
randa which was strung with japa-
nese lanterns and vibrating to the
rhythm of a native stringed orches-
tra at the foot of the steps har-
per paused before an hibiscus bush
right under the eyes of the head
waiter he plucked a large and showy
blossom and fixed it in his button-
hole


street  smiths complete stories

it was a bad introduction the
head waiter looked over the pair
critically then signed swiftly to
the manager the latter came bus-
tling up a fussy spade-bearded lit-
tle frenchman very much impressed
with himself and the persons whom
it was his duty to entertain he
took one look at the newcomers
rumpled ducks at their scuffed
shoes at their untrimmed hair

  no no no he cried waving
them away imperiously you cant
come in here this is for ladies and
gentlemen go away get out
costigan marched on up the steps
cocked his head a little and scowled
down at the little manager

  say that again he requested
ominously i dont think i heard
you right

  ah just as i thought cried
the manager triumphantly youre
drunk

 not yet but i mean to get
drunk very soon what about it
costigan thrust out his sharp jaw
his gray eyes bored into the french-
mans the latter grew more re-
spectful

  what i mean he said with an
elaborate shrug is that these tables
are all taken this is mail-boat day
we have an unusually large crowd
you know planters and others who
live out of town are here to-night
we know all about the mail boat
and the planters declared costigan
we also know that this is a hotel
open to the public as long as theyre
free white and twenty-one and got
the price to pay costigan slapped
his pocket confidently weve got
the price and we certainly mean to
eat here

  harper had been paying very lit-
tle attention to all this he was
craning his neck anxiously around
the room suddenly his face lighted
up

  theres a table he cried point-
ing

  reserved shrugged the man-
ager without even looking it is
too bad you must come again some
time

  well take that table decided
costigan

  no no no

 well-take-that-table the
words came like bullets

  the manager was mute with rage
he wanted to strike costigan and
his undersized friend he wanted to
kick them bodily down the steps and
trample on them the instinct of
self-preservation warned him how-
ever that if he gave in to his im-
pulses the outcome would likely be
very disastrous to himself some-
how he controlled himself even to
the point of making a dignified bow

  this way messieurs he said
and looked straight ahead to avoid
the frowns that some near-by guests
directed at him

  costigan looked very grim as he
sat down harper on the contrary
looked highly elated he was even
so reckless as to wink at a fluffy-
haired girl who was regarding him
disdainfully she jumped as if
stuck with a pin and tossed her
head haughtily a few moments
later when her escort wasnt look-
ing she peeked hopefully at harper
for another wink by then he was
engaged with a more important mat-
ter

  no wine he was telling a waiter
we want cognac the very best
and bring the bottle mind

costigans glance roved
challengingly over the faces
of the diners his irish tem-
per already irritated by harpers
nagging arguments had not been
improved any by the managers
greeting it was obvious that costi-
an unofficial deportation



gan had a chip on both shoulders
and was fairly begging some one to
knock them off

  his gaze was suddenly arrested
by sight of two men seated at a table
opposite his own one of these men
was short and stocky with a coun-
tenance so severe that it might have
been hacked out of granite the
other was a swarthy sloe-eyed man
with fleshy jowls and puffy eye
sacks that told of too much food and
too little work costigan did not
know the former but he knew the
latter very well indeed this man
was monsieur briffault he who had
railroaded costigan to jail

  it was the first time the two had
met since costigans release from
jail and the resentment that had
been smoldering in costigan for
weeks was kindled into flame his
gray eyes fairly burned briffaalt
returned the stare with stony con-
tempt neither man made any at-
tempt to acknowledge their acquain-
tance

  briffaults gaze fell first however
and he resumed his conversation
with the granite-faced man costi-
gan turned back to harper who had
observed the clash of eyes and was
watching his companion narrowly

  for two cents id knock that
confounded frog for a loop
growled costigan

  what dyou suppose hes doing
here inquired harper

  he always comes to town on
mail-boat day i might have known
hed be here whos the squarehead
with him

  never saw him before replied
harper theyre talking about cof-
fee must be a planter

  the manager in the hope of get-
ting rid of his unwanted guests as
soon as possible had their dinner
served with remarkable dispatch
meanwhile he hovered around like

an old hen whose brood of chicks
is menaced by a hawk he felt hot
all over whenever any one of the
regular patrons after an insolent ex-
amination of the yankees would
turn to him with an inquiring look
of disapproval he grew cold again
whenever bill costigans gray eyes
happened to light on him

  sacre he prayed fervently
will they never finish

  the americans ate slowly it was
not often they treated themselves
to such a dinner and when at
length they had finished they
showed no signs of leaving on the
contrary they filled their glasses
with brandy lighted cigarettes and
settled themselves comfortably

  the manager stifled a groan and
betook himself elsewhere the
sight was too hateful for him to en-
dure longer

  the time passed pleasantly for
harper and costigan they sipped
brandy smoked and watched the
dancers the bottle before them
was slowly emptied a waiter some-
what reluctantly brought another
costigan continued to drink stead-
ily harper drank more sparingly
from time to time a shadow of
frown touched his thin face and he
looked speculatively from costigan
to briffault each of whom seemed
to have forgotten the others pres-
ence

along toward ten oclock when
the second bottle was nearly

	empty bill costigan pro-
duced a pipe it was scarred and
chewed on the stem but it had the
faculty of making even the cheap-
est tobacco taste sweet which had
long since endeared it to costigan
who being a man of very limited
means was forced to smoke cheap
tobacco he was soon sending up
clouds of poisonous smoke

  briffault was engaged in an ear-
nest discussion with his granite-
faced companion when the first
cloud drifted between them he
checked his speech abruptly sniffed
looked around he scowled at cos-
tigan and ostentatiously fanned
himself with a handkerchief costi-
gan failed to see the gesture how-
ever and puffed on contentedly he
was feeling very mellow and was
oblivious to briffault and the memo-
ries he evoked

  soon however others began to
look around for the source of the
noxious fumes men frowned and
muttered a woman or two coughed
tactfully thus encouraged brif-
fault beckoned a waiter who in turn
approached costigan

  please sir the fellow said
doubtfully but the gentleman ob-
jects to your smoking

  huh costigan slumped in his
chair came erect with a start you
dont say what gentleman

  the waiter indicated briffault
whereupon bill costigans mouth
turned down at the corners

  oh him he said and made a
gesture as if he were brushing away
a fly

  costigan seemed about to slump
back in his chair when all of a sud-
den he straightened and fixed the
waiter with a concentrated stare

  i like to smoke he said i al-
ways smoke when i drink im go-
ing to smoke now if the gentle-
man doesnt like it tell him to go
to the devil

  costigan hitched himself around
in his chair for a long second he
looked straight at briffault then
he turned back and puffed vigor-
ously at his pipe harper noisily
chuckled his approval the waiter
went for the manager

   at this point the fluffy-haired girl
who had been pouting all evening

because harper had not looked at
her again was seized with a fit of
coughing she was determined to
make him look at her once more
whereupon she would promptly snub
him and be happy again

  briffault however misunderstood
her motives he saw her only as a
lady in distress of another sort be-
ing a gallant man-when surrounded
by friends-he rose and went over
to costigan

  monsieur he said haughtily
you make a nuisance of yourself
kindly put out that filthy pipe or
remove yourself immediately from
the veranda

  costigans mellowness already
ebbing swiftly now vanished com-
pletely immediately the tide of
his hatred of briffault swept over
him his reply to the frenchmans
mandate was to emit a great cloud
of smoke briffault suddenly found
himself enveloped by heavy fumes
that caught at his throat and made
him gag

  allez he spluttered angrily i
myself shall throw you out

then briffault lashed out
blindly striking costigans
mouth with the open palm of
his hand the orchestra chose that
moment to stop so that the sound
was distinctly audible over the en-
tire veranda then before costigan
could move briffault caught up a
glass of brandy and hurled the con-
tents into his face

  pig camel take that he
cried

  the veranda was immediately in
an uproar chairs crashed over
backward glasses were swept to the
floor the fluffy-haired girl
screamed shrilly from all sides
men rushed toward the scene of the
quarrel some of them surrounded
costigan pushing him this way and
an unofficial deportation



that imploring him to hold his tem-
per and act like a gentleman

  the granite-faced man was one of
the last to move he rose slowly
and went up to briffault

  leave this to me he said calmly
i know how to handle drunken
beach combers

  blinded by the brandy some mo-
ments passed before costigan was
ready for action but as soon as he
had wiped the stuff from his eyes
he lifted his head like an angry bull
he uttered a soft bellow that scat-
tered the circle of men surrounding
him then he made straight for
briffault

  the granite-faced man however
suddenly appeared to block his way
he jerked a horny thumb and in a
voice of unquestionable authority
said

  get out

  costigan didnt argue he hardly
even stopped his fist shot out with
the kick of a mule in it it struck
the other on the jaw and sent him
reeling into the crowd when
helped to his feet some minutes
later he was minus a perfectly good
bicuspid and an equally good canine
tooth

  when briffault saw that nothing
separated himself from six feet of
yankee muscle and brawn backed
up by a volcanic irish temper he
lost his head he seized a carafe
and hurled it at costigan it missed
costigans head by half an inch but
doubled his fury

  unluckily the little manager
chose that moment to dash into the
fray his shrill pleas for the com-
batants to cease for the honor of the
establishment died on his lips the
carafe struck him a glancing blow
on his head and he went down for
good

  then bill costigan closed in on
briffault and very quickly proved

 to the swarthy frenchman that
 thirty days in jail can have results
 that he had never dreamed of cos-
 tigan did not assassinate briffault
 but he came close to it briffault
 never looked quite the same after-
 ward

   harper meanwhile was not idle
 he saw to it that costigan and brif-
 fault were not interrupted he
 danced round and round the sway-
 ing pair shoving back the crowd

  he struck when and where neces-
 sary to accomplish his end and he
 kept up a ceaseless flowof insult

   it was harper more than costi-
 gan who aroused the patrons to
 concerted action at last it was all
 right for them to insult strangers
 with glassy stares but when stran-
 gers insulted them that was a differ-
 ent matter a brave fellow on the
 edge of the crowd finally called
 them to arms

   throw them out he yelled it
 is an outrage it is a disgrace
 throw the bandits out

   harper urged them on with jeers
 and taunts he did not seem at all
 afraid as the crowd slowly closed in
 the reason was he had an ace up
 his sleeve he played just as the
 first pair of hands reached out to
 seize him

   he leaped into the air and pulled
 down a string of japanese lanterns
 with the circuit broken the entire
 veranda was instantly plunged into
 darkness likewise it was plunged
 into chaos

   when the police arrived ten min-
 utes later and lights were rigged up
 the veranda looked like a hurricane
 had struck it tables were over-
 turned the floor was littered with
 broken china and silverware was
 strewn everywhere several women
 had fainted and not a few of the
 men had blackened eyes and blood-
 ied noses never in the history of

port des galets had anything like
this happened outside of the water-
front dives there was talk of
lynching the two americans

the two americans however
were nowhere around they
were in fact several blocks
away bolting headlong for the wa-
ter front

  which way runt panted costi-
gan as they leaped over the railroad
tracks

 the manhattan maid gasped
harper in reply

 but our baggage protested
costigan we cant leave it

  got to youre an undesirable
alien now and youre being de-
ported whether you like it or not

  costigan offered no further pro-
test but redoubled his efforts for
the manhattan maid had suddenly
become a very desirable objective in
his eyes

  the hour was late and the streets
deserted the two fugitives reached
the steamer without mishap were
received with open arms by the
watchman and stowed in a lifeboat
there they lay for an anxious hour
listening to the shouts and cries of
police patrols and self-appointed
posses of outraged citizenry that
were scouring the town and harbor
for them it seemed an eternity be-
fore midnight came and the ship
sailed them away to safety

  moriorty made a great show of
surprise when he discovered the
americans early next morning he
dressed them down severely for the
benefit of the crew then led them
before the captain

 the stowaways turned pale as
they came face to face with the cap-
tain he himself turned a fiery red
the three it appeared had met be-
fore as evidence of their acquain-
tance the captain had a badly swol-

len jaw and was minus a perfectly
good bicuspid and an equally good
canine tooth

  the captain was briffaults gran-
ite-faced companion

  a long minute of suspended ani-
mation ensued then the captain
turned to the mate

  whats all this mr moriorty
he inquired stowaways eh well
well what do you know about
that now

  and the captains granitelike face
cracked in a smile that made the
stowaways feel sick

  howd they get aboard won-
dered the captain presently came
up the hawsers like a couple of dock
rats i suppose well my hearties
youll find dock rats arent very
popular aboard this ship

 i thought stated costigan
bravely that we were to be signed
on as supercargo and wireless opera-
tor

  the captain looked dumfounded
so did the mate then the captain
smote the chart-room table with a
fist like a mallet and roared

  ho thats a good one drunk
as a lord yet arent you the cap-
tain suddenly sobered and fixed cos-
tigan with a brassy stare well
mister ill give you something to
sober you up its two thousand
miles to cape town youre going
to live on bread and water till we get
there and youre going to work till
you drop and if you so much as
bat an eye the wrong way ill break
your heads now get out of my
sight before i remember the teeth
you knocked out of my head

the sun was lifting over the
horizon a fiery red ball that
forecast a scorching day
when moriorty led the two stow-
aways forward they had eaten
generously of bread and had washed
an unofficial deportation



it down with cold water in their
hands were chipping hammers

  get to work ordered moriorty
harshly you pulled a fast one on
me you did one peep out of either
of you and ill break your heads my-
self

  when the mate had gone costi-
gan and harper stood very still
looking down at the rust-eaten deck
then costigan looked at harper

  you fixed it all right he said
speaking from the corner of his
mouth supercargo-wireless op-
erator-eat in the officers mess
you runt i ought to knock you
for a loop

  he took a step toward harper
who backed away

  had everything framed didnt

you pursued costigan you got
me up to the st charles knowing
that fat briffault would be there
and wed tangle somehow fessup
didnt you now

  how was i to know it was brif-
faults coffee that was being shipped
on this tub pleaded harper by way
of admission

  costigan took another step toward
harper who raised his hammer in
warning then costigans bruised
face broke into a grin

  put down that hammer runt he
chuckled i wouldnt have missed
it for the world a swell feed swell
liquor and a swell fight

 and were out of that con-
founded town added harper
right shake on it

eat herbs and keep calm

recently at kaihsien in the province of szechwan died one of
the oldest-if not the oldest-men in the world according to his
own reckoning li chung-yun was one hundred and ninety-seven
years old the belief among chinese authorities is that li chung-yun
misrepresented his age according to them he was two hundred and
twenty-five years old chinese dispatches which were unearthed by a
professor at changtu university show that in  a hundred and five
years ago official felicitations were received by li from the chinese gov-
ernment the occasion was his one hundred and fiftieth birthday and
again in  he was congratulated when he passed the two-hundred-year
mark

   from chungking comes the information that in  li chung-yun
said that he had buried twenty-three wives and was living happily with
the twenty-fourth

    the aged chinaman still hale and hearty said that he had always
drunk great quantities of rice wine throughout the two and a half cen-
turies of his life li chung-yun also said that he had eaten nothing but
herbs all his life and that he never indulged in any form of violent exercise
he attributed his great number of years to harmony of spirit and soul
which produced great peace of mind and inward calm

    a chinese general who had once ruled peiping as a war lord stated
that li chung-yun had lived in his house over a period of time and that
he had found him an educated and virile fellow the general had also
heard li lecture on how to get the most out of each century


 killer s luck

by james stevens

bad-ax carhart-trail tamer

the mackinawed back of
smoky fournier made a
broad target as it loomed
darkly against the ice of
the lumber river and the
snow-laden pines of the far bank
sam flick-red sam to his sixty
lumberjacks-was an open forty feet
behind fournier as he stepped from
the shelter of a charred snag his
thick right arm swung out a double-
bitted ax with a five-pound blade

  the gray-blue twilight of the win-
ter woods was closing over the
stumps snags and windfalls of the

banking grounds snow struck in
lashing lines across the clearing be-
tween smoky and red sam

  the ax lifted in a deliberate over-
handed swing as the blade ap-
proached the highest sweep of its
arc the speed of the stroke swift-
ened so smoothly that red sam
seemed only to toss the ax with a
lazy shift of shoulders and arm

  for an instant a whistling whine
knifed through the boom of the
storm the whirling blade made a
dull glitter through the slanting
lines of snow the hickory handle

com-a
killers luck



spun like a spoke in the hub of a
racing wheel red sam shifted
back into the shelter of the charred
snag

  the whine of the flying blade
ended in a muffled thud then the
rumble of rolling logs sounded from
the river bank the rumble mut-
tered out for a long minute red
sam listened through the boom of
the storm at last his chest heaved
in a great breath crouching out
from behind the snag the killer ran
like a bear for the rollways

  this was the first day of the
sleigh haul in the sleet river pinery
only a crust of logs lay on the long
slope of the bank with a small pile
at the bottom bulwark smoky
fourniers body was huddled against
that pile evidently his fall had un-
loosed some logs and he had rolled
down with them

  blood oozed from a great gash in
the back of fourniers mackinaw
the coat was new its red-and-green
checks vivid in the falling snow
red sam wadded the folds of the
mackinaw against the ooze of blood
then swung the lifeless body up in
his arms he ran clumsily but with
amazing speed out on the river ice
and rounded the butt of a windfall
that jutted from the bank above the
rollway here was a big eddy too
riotous for freezing under a sheer
bank there was a heavy splash a
swirl of black water momentarily
streaked with red

  five minutes later red sam was
still searching for his ax on the roll-
way logs its disappearance was the
one streak of black luck in the work-
ing out of a shrewd plan at last
he had to be satisfied with a convic-
tion that the ax had lodged under
the logs of the rollway there it
should remain undiscovered until
spring when the rollways would be
broken out for the log drive down-

 com-a

river in the meantime nobody in
this neck of the woods was apt to
question sam flick he was the
boss of a winter-bound camp the
czar of sleet river

  the snowfall was already blanket-
ing the tracks and stains about the
rollway red sam headed back for
the snag in a minute he was van-
ishing in the slash snowshoeing to-
ward a strip of felled pines in which
he had blazed skid trails during the
afternoon

  the wind rushed over the river
ice the thunder of blowing boughs
in the pines of the far bank surged
through shadows and snow

  it was black weather when bad-
ax carhart swung into the rollway
with the last load of logs for the
day he lifted a halloo for the roll-
way boss getting no response the
teamster decided that fournier had
already started afoot on a short-cut
trail for camp he canthooked his
load off the sleigh and swung his
four horses around from the bank-
ing grounds

it was a night for mystery in the
woods the norther slashed
through chinks in the bunk
shanty and pounded the shake roof
an endless thunder surged from the
pines above camp the flames of
the pyramid of logs blazing on the
open camboose-a square of raised
earth in the center of the shanty-
leaped toward the smoke hole in the
roof this light flowed and ebbed
over the rugged mackinawed fig-
ures hunched on benches that cir-
cled the camboose

  every man was staring wide-eyed
at ed stair the boss teamster stair
was generally as close-mouthed as
red sam but he was talking freely
now about the disappearance of
smoky fournier

  no man would take a run out in


street  smiths complete stories

the winter woods with a blizzard
threatenin unless he was skeered of
his neck declared the boss team-
ster it looks plain as daylight to
me bessie murdock and herb hall
drive into camp to see smoky spe-
cial-fifty miles in a cutter from
menominac that means business
smoky learns theyre here and its
hell-bent for him how he learned
is the mystery

  stair paused and regarded bad-ax
carhart the men on the benches
shifted uneasily and a mutter ran
around but nobody else spoke up
it was simple wisdom for a jack to
attend strictly to his own affairs in
the sleet river camp it was wiser
still to backtrack from the first
smell of trouble with bad-ax car-
hart

  the teamster was in from supper
smoking a pipe in the shadows of his
bunk before going to bed down his
four horses but now carhart
turned toward stair the silence in
the shanty became so close that the
thunder of the storm seemed to swell
into sudden fury

  stair held his seat waiting im-
passively he was a swarthy lank
man hugely boned with the black
eyes of an indian and he was an
indian on the woods and river trails
and also hi his habit of snaking a
knife from his shirt when a fight
threatened

 bad-ax carhart had earned an
ugly reputation as a hellion in the
saloon rows of menominac and he
was a champion ax man in the woods
and a top hand on the sleigh hauls
and river drives but now the sleet
river jacks were seeing the hellion
in the red light and smoky shadows
of the camboose fire his head
crowned by a shaggy mane of sandy
hair and fronted with a face that
was slashed with scars from a hun-
dred fist-and-boot battles made one

think of hewn rock his eyes had
the look of blue steel he chopped
out his words like chips from a pine

  were talkin turkey bad-ax
said hauling up before the boss
teamster youre tryin to play me
foul bully held me on the haul
an hour longer than anybody now
you intimate im hooked up with
fournier in a killin that i warned
him talk up hear me

  i said nothin of a killin
snarled stair

  dont try to palaver me stair
talk turkey you meant that mar-
tin murdock was killed in the woods
by smoky fournier last spring you
meant that he learned murdocks girl
was in camp and smoky took a run
out to save his neck you meant
that smoky fournier was warned by
me-hey

  stairs answer was to ease a bony
hand inside his mackinaw his eyes
narrowing to glittering black slits
as carhart moved the boss team-
ster kicked back his bench and came
up like a striking snake

 but carhart was moving back-
ward-three swift steps his huge
right hand driving for the boar-
hide belt from which the slim dou-
ble blade of a felling ax of norway
steel always jutted at the third
step the handle of the ax was sol-
idly in his grip

stairs long body coiled into a
crouch the blade of a hunt-
ing knife flashed in the red
firelight carhart lunged stair
swerved from the threat of the ax
his knife hand faltering in the in-
stant carhart jerked the ax blade
down shifting his grip it was the
hickory handle that swept over from
a jerk of the wrist the hard wood
struck stairs arm with paralyzing
force the knife thudded to the
hard earth of the shanty floor
killers luck



  now then bully growled the
hellion now well talk turkey-
with fist and boot

  no you wont a dull wooden
voice hammered from the shanty
door chop er now i do all the
fightin in this here camp

  even as he fell back bad-ax car-
hart was thinking that this horning
in of red sams was a little too
timely to be accidental it was his
hunch that the camp boss had been
lurking at the door from start to
finish but he said nothing red
sams word was law on sleet river
bad-ax had to take it or take the
trail and he had plenty of private
reasons for wanting to hold on in
this neck of the sleet

  youre a king jack stated the
camp boss but ed is the boss of
the sleigh haul i need you both
whoever starts trouble again gets
a run-out but first he settles with
me now shake up

  stair had apparently lost his
venom he  shoved out a hand
carhart took it for a shake things
were working in his head a queer
play he thought but he let it go
he had a deal of his own to riffle in
this sleet river game

  ed you track over to the van
shanty with me red sam was say-
ing i told my company you know
plenty about that band of chippe-
was up the sleet you might give
em a blaze on the trail of smoky
fournier

  he hid out with the injuns once
before right enough said stair
if carhart would talk though we

could probably-

  chop it red sam muttered the
command but it was harshly com-
pelling im askin him nothin
questions aint healthy in the
woods hey bad-ax

  not to me growled the hellion
i got my horses to bed sleep to

make and logs to haul thats all
i know

  red sams stony eyes glinted with
satisfaction bad-ax carhart it
seemed was a man after his own
heart the teamster turned to his
bunk he yanked on a mackinaw
and cap and shoved the norway ax
back into his boar-hide belt then
he lighted a lantern and trailed red
sam and stair to the door

  out in the stormy darkness car-
hart separated from the two with-
out a word and headed for the sta-
ble but as soon as he beard the
bang of the van-shanty door he
doused the lantern and swung
around in a moment he was prowl-
ing at the shanty window

bad-ax carhart was a dep-
uty u s marshal of the
menominac district but his
commission was a secret to all but
marshal john swayne and himself
carharts value as a trail tamer was
in his reputation as a lawless tim-
ber savage the infection of the
menominac frontier with timber pi-
rates who joined thievery with mur-
der had at last forcedcarhart to
take the side of law and human de-
cency

  six weeks ago marshal swayne
had ordered his trail tamer to sleet
river the case was the disappear-
ance of martin murdock trapper
and owner of two sections of pines
on the sleet murdock had van-
ished in the woods last spring a
land-office notice of a sale of the
murdock timber for delinquent taxes
gave the marshal a solid clew sam
flick was the under-cover buyer
the collection of solid evidence
against the sleet river boss was a
job for bad-ax carhart

  so far the deputy had played a
cautious game his own savage in-
stinct was simply to track down an


street  smiths complete stories

evildoer and take the law into his
own hands even a red sam would
talk turkey if cornered with a pine
torch threatening his eyes or with
a razor-edged ax drawing blood at
his throat but the ways of the law
are not so primitive as marshal
swayne had at last made his hellion
realize and carhart had to guard
his secret maintain his mask he
was learning the law but in a crisis
he generally reverted to the instincts
of bad-ax the timber savage

  these instincts surged in him now
as he peered through the window of
the van shanty red sam and ed
stair were questioning bessie mur-
dock and the lawyer lad herb hall
the woods boss was squatted on the
van chest nodding agreement as
stair talked the latter stood by
the box stove his black eyes glit-
tering in the candlelight hall faced
the boss teamster he was a lean
loose-jointed young giant but he
appeared soft and awkward in
woodsmans garb but the lad had
a gray fighting eye and a hard jaw

  from that simple impression an
idea began to spark in the deputy
marshal it was smothered for a
moment as he wondered at the girl
beyond the window she had a
white flawer of a face above a hud-
dle of bear-skin coat-halls coat
carhart surmised but what the
devil was she here for why hadnt
hall come alone probably he had
no suspicion of sam flick and he
was a greenhorn

 the sight of bessie murdock
hardened carharts primitive resolu-
tion it was for the likes of her that
he had turned trail tamer his gaze
roved toward the girl again

 then it was caught held in-
tensely by a double-bitted ax hung
on the log wall red sam blazed his
roads and trails with an ax that was
a twin of the one carhart packed

in his boar-hide belt a prime blade
of norway steel every night the
camp boss hung the ax on a peg
above the van chest when he came
in from the woods an ax was in
the place now one so like the other
that even a knowing eye would be
apt to pass it over but carhart
was on the prowl for trail signs
the edge of the bits on the ax there
had a deeper curve than the nor-
way it was a common camp ax

 the rest of the scene instantly
lost interest for the deputy he
fell back into the shadows of stormy
darkness remembering an idea that
marshal swayne had once hammered
into him

  theres a thing i call killers
luck carhart the marshal had said
you keep it in mind when youre
tempted to tear loose and chop a
confession out of a man youre track-
ing down its the rule that a killer
always makes some slip murder
will out look for that slip kill-
ers luck is the laws percentage in
your game

 carhart remembered now and it
was his hunch that the switch of
red sams prize ax for a camp tool
was a hole card in this deal

 that idea about the young giant
of a greenhorn herb hall was yet
firing up in carhart it called for
savage action so as he headed
down for the stable shanty carhart
projected a plan that was half law
and half primitive vengeance-his
usual compromise

for once carhart took scant
care of his sleigh horses he
gave them just enough licks
with currycomb and brush to make
stair know that he had been down
then he doused his lantern and left
the stable he swung swiftly through
the blowing snow and shadows for
the camp lights up the slope
killers luck



  as carhart neared the kitchen
shanty a blacker shadow loomed
suddenly ahead stair bunked in
the stable feed room he was ap-
parently coming down to turn in

  that you bad-ax stairs harsh
voice cut through the shadows
who else

  whats the matter with your lan-
tern

  they were face to face now
what do you think the storm
whiffed it out of course carhart
hauled up playing the part of
bad-ax again harken to a word
bully he rasped well keep
peace if you just log and dont try
to play fox with me i dont give a
damn about smoky fournier but
dont try to hook me in on his run-
out i want to know if you shot off
your mouth to the murdock girl and
that greenhorn

  i told em what red sam did
stair replied sullenly and that
you know nothin as for us tend
your team proper and hold up your
end on the haul and well get along
if we dont youll be gettin
along without a neck bully
growled carhart shoving on and
thats a tough trick

  as he turned into the gap between
the kitchen and bunk shanties car-
hart stopped to consider his next
move the gap was a twelve-foot
space covered by a shed roof and
used for the storage of firewood
lantern light glimmered through
the cracks in the kitchen door the
cook was still working-and he was
not alone shifting closer carhart
caught the sound of voices through
the planks of the door he swung
into the shelter of the wall and
stood like a stump cold minutes
passed bit at last the door opened
red sam bulked out in the dim ob-
long of light with herb hall tow-
ering beside him

  you rest easy now red sam
boomed in hearty tones your gal
will be snug and safe in the van
i dont mind bunkin up with the
men a particle and dont you no-
tice the growls of the cook glad
to make you comfortable mighty
glad it plagues me to the marrow
that fournier sneaked out on you
gnight young feller

  red sam swung on into the bunk
shanty hall stood fast staring
after him then the giant shape of
the lad moved toward the open and
halted again he was watching the
light of the van-shanty window
suddenly it went out

  shell be all right hall spoke
aloud reassuring himself maybe
im wrong about sam flick he
seems such a simple great-hearted
man of the woods-

  halls voice trailed out in the
wind he swung back for the
kitchen as the door closed on him
carhart tramped on for the bunk
shanty inside he shuffled wearily
for his bunk yawning hugely as he
hung up his lantern the jacks
were turning in a half dozen were
still on the benches at the sinking
fire of the camboose red sam
bulked among them he was ex-
plaining the presence of bessie
murdock and herb hall in camp

  it was a breed from that chip-
pewa band up the sleet that started
em boomed red sam come to
menominac with a pack of pelts and
got hisself swacked on whisky his
drunken blab hitched smoky four-
nier with the vanishin of martin

self made the law shark join her

to-day but the storm stalled em
thats how we got our company
seems the rumor was right ven-
tured one of the jacks fournier
must have murdocks blood on him
to take out in this weather

 hell make the chippewa camp
easy said another the injunsll
lose him from anybody what i
wonder is who warned him

 red sam sucked at his pipe si-
lence fell around carhart knew
that suspicious stares were fixed on
his broad back but he knew also
that the suspicions would not be
voiced not after his show-down
with stair he rolled into the shad-
ows of his bunk there he pulled
off his boots and mackinaw and bun-
rowed into his blankets in a min-
ute he was snoring heavily

carhart let some thirty
minutes pass before he stirred
in his bunk it was the best
time for a move the fire was smol-
dering low and chill air was creep-
ing into the shanty in another half
hour some jack would rouse up from
the cold and replenish the fire the
storm was now heaving in a furi-
ous blast along the log walls car-
hart crept up and out like a prowl-
ing cat at the door he paused lis-
tening there was no sound from
red sams bunk the deputy eased
out latching the door noiselessly be-
hind him he stooped to pull on his
calked boots and lace them then
he ran on pulling into his mackinaw

 he headed down for the stable
shanty the wind was still boom-
ing heavily but the snowfall had
slackened for the time being car-
hart was relieved at the prospect of
a short storm even if his plan
went through a blizzard-locked
camp would make a bad complica-
tion in the morning

	twice the deputy halted to make

sure that he was not followed
nothing loomed on his trail at
last he was at the stable door and
easing quietly into the animal
warmth of the stalls here the
darkness was dense but carhart
knew every inch of the building he
tramped with slow noiseless steps
for the feed room as he pulled the
latch a horse nickered scenting a
fresh feed of oats at the sound
carhart heaved into swift action
he yanked up his norway ax with
one hand as he yanked the door open
with the other then a single lunge
took him to stairs bunk

  the boss teamster was raising up
with a snarling yell it expired in
a gasping gurgle as a hand like an
oak clamp caught his throat car-
hart grimly put on the pressure until
he felt the man going limp then
as stair choked convulsively for his
breath the deputy dropped the ax
and groped for the mans breeches
at the head of the bunk in less than
a minute stair was trussed up with
his own suspenders he was now
able to wheeze words

  what th ell and who are you
he gasped out loudly through the
blackness

  carhart took a warning grip on
stairs bony neck again keep
quiet and you wont be hurt he
shaded his tone to a hoarse mutter
and picked his words im hall
you tell me what happened to four-
nier or ill finish you like a rat

 the greenhorn- amazement

smothered fear in stair for the mo-
ment youre not-the law shark
who-

  just him sounded the grim mut-
ter you thought i was the fool
easy maybe so but ive got you
tell me where fournier is-or youll
follow him

  the oaklike hand slowly tight-
ened the other brought up the ax
killers luck



the savage was claiming bad-ax
carhart now crouching low over
stair his breath was a hot gust the
blade of the norway fanned the
smothering blackness stairs chest
heaved convulsively a lightning
shift of carharts hand choked the
yell of panic

  red sams ax the grind of ice
was in the deputys voice as he
chanced the guess blood on the
blade-blood on the snow wheres
smoky fournier

  the big-boned body went limp
ed stair lay in the darkness shiv-
ering and sweating coldly with hor-
rible fear the norway fanned him
again ed stair talked like a man
in a fever

  ill tell red barnll butcher me
-like fournier

  wheres fournier hammered
carhart

  in the big eddy i warned red
sam you and the murdock girl were
in camp he went crazy fournier
had been threatenin-but i swear i
was back in the slash and red sam
done it all-

  stairs feverish voice broke into
an incoherent mutter the man was
cracking with panic carhart de-
cided to quiz him no more for the
time being the ferocity of the tim-
ber savage yielded to the cold cau-
tion of the trail tamer again the
law demanded solid evidence car-
hart knew where to get it now
killers luck had given him a clew
in red sams missing ax stair had
told enough to start carhart for the
river

  he gagged the boss teamster with
his own bandanna then took a pair
of trace chains from the stable and
bound him solidly to the bunk in
another five minutes bad-ax carhart
was tracking snowshoes into the
sleigh-haul road with a pole sled in
tow

after an hour of grim persist-
ent labor carhart recovered
 fourniers body with a
ten-foot pike pole from the rollway
tool cache lashed to a black-ash pole
of equal length the deputy swung
from the butt of the windfall and
searched the depths of the black
swirl of water between the sheer
bank and a ragged crescent of ice
again and again the pronged pole
drove down with carhart exerting
all his strength of shoulders and
arms against the sucking whirl of
the eddy he straddled the sloping
log his knees gripping the crumbly
wood at every thrust sweep and
pull he swayed dangerously over
the black water hard snow lashed
his face but he drove grimly on

  at last when the certainty was
gripping him that stair had lied or
else the body of fournier had been
swept on from the eddy the prong
of the pike pole caught and held
keeping a tight grip with his mit-
tened hands carhart braced himself
and cautiously heaved on the pole
slowly hand over hand he drew
the burden to the surface his body
swaying from the hips with the ed-
dys circling sweep then a short
hard pull carharts right hand
closed over a mackinaw collar he
heaved the dripping body of smoky
fournier over the windfall and
swung for the rollway

  leaving his grisly load on the pole
sled carhart prowled in the slash
for a piece of dry pitchy pine his
search ended at a slivered snag
wrenching off a big splinter he
struck a match in the shelter of his
mackinaw and in a moment had a
smoky torch blazing in the wind
its gloomy light revealed how four-
nier had been killed

  carhart straightened and turned
for the rollway the fired pitch
sputtered and snarled under the lash

of the wind now thrusting a yellow
tongue of flame into the snow swirls
then threatening to smother out
shielding his light carhart stared
down over the snow-covered logs
trying to form an image of the mur-
der of fournier in his mind

  red sam he knew could bury the
blade of a five-pound ax in the butt
of a pine log with a sixty-foot throw
a feat which had been matched many
times by carhart himself red sam
had come down through the slash
fournier then must have been fac-
ing the river to make a target no
doubt at the head of the rollway
carhart could see the stricken man
pitching down the logs

  carhart made up his mind that
the hunch was at least worth a play
he returned to the tool cache for a
canthook then he swung down the
logs to the river ice dropping his
torch he pried out the bulwark logs
in a matter of twenty minutes he had
rolled out enough timber for a look
into the bottom of the pile

 again the deputy lighted his
torch in a low crouch he prowled
to and fro over the bottom logs
searching every chink on the third
round a dull glitter caught his gaze
with a growl of triumph carhart
wedged k hand between two logs and
brought up red sams norway ax
from haft to razor edge one bit
was a rusty smear shreds of red-
and-green cloth clung to the sides
of the bit threads slashed and
caught from fourniers mackinaw

  killers luck muttered bad-ax
to himself as he headed back for
the pole sled marshal swayne was
right luck slips for every killer
somehow

  the work of the law was done
now carhart faced the necessity of
keeping the mask of bad-ax the
hellion over this nights taming of
the sleet river trails

herb hall was sleeping
badly in the spare bunk in
the kitchen shanty it was
not the hardness of his bed or the
uproar of the storm that kept him
wakeful hall was a town man but
he was no stranger to roughing it in
the pine woods what kept his
nerves tense and his eyes wide open
to-night was a gripping sense of a
black phantom of evil brooding over
the sleet river camp herb hall
was a greenhorn in the woods but
he knew men-criminal men and
their traits he had felt the sneer
and the menace under sam flicks
hearty welcome he had sensed the
lie in ed stairs sullen explanation

  it was a formless but oppressive
fear for the safety of bessie mur-
dock that finally forced young hall
to quit the warmth of his bunk and
ease out into the windy night the
same dread had kept him from pull-
ing off his clothing when he turned
in booted and mackinawed hall
made for the shanty door once he
stumbled with a heavy thud but the
snores of the cook were unbroken

  hall shut the door behind him and
pushed out of the blackness of the
shed-roofed space between the two
shanties in the open the wind
whipped snow iito his eyes hall
stood blindly for a moment getting
hi bearings then as he started
toward the vague bulk of the van
shanty he glimpsed the shape of a
man looming at his right fists up
herb hall whirled in his tracks

bad-ax had halted the pole sled
and its grim load at the cor-
ner of the kitchen shanty he
was puffing heavily from the haul
up the slope and he rested against
the log wall until he had his wind
again then he straightened up for
the next move in his masked game
this depended solely on the com-
killers luck



mon sense and nerve of the young
giant of a greenhorn herb hall

  it would be a ticklish trick car-
hart realized to rouse the lad up and
get him out for a talk without also
awakening the cook but even as
he faced this problem he saw that
herb hall himself was solving it
for him

  carhart crouched sharply under
the fist that was swinging like a
maul for his head then even as
he hooked the lads arm in an iron
grip he was thinking exultantly that
herb hall was his man for nerve
anyhow if hed only listen to
sense

  chop it carhart commanded in
a harsh whisper as hall struggled
against him im a friend-of yours
and smoky fourniers listen now
ive got a killer hooked if youll
haul along

  carhart relaxed his grip and
stepped back as hall quieted down

  who are you the lad demanded
he pressed close again peering
through the thick shadows

  keep your distance carhart or-
dered thats the first thing you
got to know-that who and what
i am dont count im a jack a
friend of martin murdocks who is
here to prowl his killer down
thats enough for you carhart
lowered his voice to a harsh
guarded mutter ive been doin
things ed stair is trussed up and
gagged in his bunk he talked tur-
key i found fourniers body and
the ax that finished him red sam
is the killer the evidence is solid
but im out of it the job is now
yours are you game for it

  for a moment herb hall was si-
lent the two men faced each other
with snow and night a blowing veil
between them then

  what do you want me to do
said hall steadily

  plenty but most of all to take
on the credit or whatever you want
to call it for what ive already done
shes like this

  briefly carhart narrated his do-
ings of the night they left herb
hall sort of gasping

  but man i cant he protested
nobody would believe it

  ed stair already believes it de-
clared carhart and when you
march him into the bunk shanty
along with red sams ax and four-
niers body outside the jacks will
believe you plenty ill be one of
them in my bunk i mean im out
of this hear me

  i hear you hall was steady
again there was steel in his tone
as he spoke on this means that
bessies father is dead

  murdered was carharts harsh
reply its plain that red sam
killed him with stair and fournier
you force a show-down with the
grafters in the land office and youll
see why murdock was delinquent
in his taxes he wont show up to
redeem his land flick is grabbin
it thats all

  hall groaned all that in the
clean free woods but what are you
getting out of this he demanded
impulsively

  the clean free woods said car-
hart softly that sounds good
but no more questions youre
goin down now for ed stair-goin
down the second time hear me
the second time

the trail tamer considered that
a good nights work was done
as bootless he entered the
bunk shanty from his bunk he
would watch herb halls play as
one of the sleet river jacks then
a deep weary sleep the sleigh haul
to-morrow-and the clean free
woods

  so bad-ax carhart was thinking
in his relaxing mood as he latched
the door silently behind him he
turned noiselessly toward the dull
glow of the smoldering camboose
as he did a pitch pocket in a
charred log exploded in a crackling
burst of sparks flames flared to-
ward the smoke hole a rasping
grunt sounded from a bunk on the
far side of the camboose

  carhart swore under his breath
and held back in the smoky shadows
of the wall he was certain that the
man who had roused up was red
sam no doubt the killer was sleep-
ing light to-night anyhow square-
set shoulders were bulking from a
bunk and now a shaggy red head
was silhouetted in the firelight red
sam beyond any doubt

 and he was coming his wool-
socked feet padding on the packed
earth floor circling the camboose
his head jutting ominously as he
peered into the wall shadow

  carhart crouched shielding his
face behind his upturned mackinaw
collar his right hand jerked to his
belt the handle of the norway ax
swished free carhart gripped the
blade holding it close to his side
the hickory handle dangling red
sam swayed closer the growl of a
bear in kis thick throat carhart
took a sudden step ahead to get
clearance for a backward jerk of his
right arm the jerk brought the
handle up like a spear and like a
spear carhart drove the butt of the
handle for red sams square chin

  it struck with a smacking thud
red sam sagged with a windy grunt
and sprawled face down on the
floor carhart dove for his bunk
after hooking up his boots in a
swoop he tossed boots and ax to
the back of the bunk yanked off his
mackinaw and crawled into the
blankets pulling them over his

head he kept one eye cocked on the
door and on the quiet bulk of red
sam

  nerve-wrenching seconds passed
but finally just as carhart was won-
dering if halls nerve hadnt failed
him the latch clicked and lifted
the shanty door swung open with
a crash

  herb hall stood on the threshold
a lantern in his left hand the kill-
ers ax in the other the lantern
glow fell on the unconscious form
of the woods boss the big lad
stared in wonder then in sudden
alarm as chesty voices shouted out
from the bunks

  the uproar grew as other lanterns
flared and the jacks saw the camp
boss stretched out with the big
greenhorn standing over him swing-
ing an ax then the lad got his
nerve again he whipped around
and yanked ed stair inside at the
sight of the boss teamster with his
hands chained behind him the awak-
ening jacks were momentarily struck
dumb with amazement halls reso-
nant young voice rang out

  listen you men smoky four-
nier was murdered so was martin
murdock and ed stair has con-
fessed that the killer was red
sam

  for a brief moment the men of
the sleet river camp gaped in
stunned astonishment at the green-
horn from menominac at the cow-
ering boss teamster and at the mo-
tionless bulk on the floor then red
sam stirred as he scrambled to
his knees he faced herb hall the
blade of his norway ax swung be-
fore his suddenly terrified gaze one
bit shone the other was dull with
a smear of blood as red sam
shrank back the jacks came to life
they pressed forward with a rising
mutter of threats

  bad-ax carhart was among them
killers luck



now glaring as wildly as the others
for a moment he feared a lynching
as some of the men pushed through
the door and saw smoky fourniers
body slashed through the back on
the pole sled but herb hall kept
his nerve

  its my capture he declared
youll get red sams ax before you
take him there is law in the
woods

  right now the word of herb hall
was the law on sleet river in the
eyes of the sleet river woodsmen
he had forced a confession from ed
stair recovered fourniers body in

  a round-trip track through a storm
and had finally dropped red sam
with an ax-handle smash to the chin
such a greenhorn was somebody to
respect even by veteran woodsmen

  bad-ax regarded the scene with
grim satisfaction he stared wood-
enly whenever hall shot a searching
gaze through the crowd there was
no glory for him and he wanted
none bad-ax listened to the wind
in the pine boughs

  clean and free again mused the
timber savage

a s mournful martin sat his
horse and looked at bob
f wl wileys ranch house he
  was sure no one was in
it except for four
horses in a small corral he found
no sign of life outside either

 mournful was disturbed at
wileys request he had come over
here to see how sam tate was get-
ting along sam was a handy man

by charles wesley

on wileys ranch and wiley had
heard nothing from him for three
days having lately married doro-
thy butler wiley had taken up his
headquarters at the butler place
mournful thought that since bob
had so many other things to think
of he was a pretty good fella for
having thought of sam at all

 mournful hoped that sam wasnt
lying dead in that house sam was
old and mournful knew that old
men sometimes quietly fold up

 taking out his gun mournful ex-
wrong

sanders

amined it and returned it to its hol-
ster it was just possible old sam
had got into some kind of a jam

keeping his eyes on the house
he sent his horse forward slowly
he came up between the house and a
shed back of it he found by a sin-
gle glance that no one was in the
shed dismounting he went up to
the kitchen door stood close to it
and listened intently there was
no sound from within

hey sam he called

no response finding the door



unlocked mournful pushed it open
and stood in the doorway there
were unwashed dishes on the table
and one unwashed pan on the stove
either sam had been taken sick and
was now lying in his bedroom or he
had departed hastily after a meal
mournful knew this because in past
visits to the house he had seen that
sam was meticulous in the per-
formance of his household duties
sam couldnt ride much any more
and the housework was his chief
task

  mournful went to sams bedroom
the bed had been slept in but had
not been made that was additional
proof that sam had left hastily


street  smiths complete stories

  in that situation the only thing
left to do was to look for sign out-
side mournful found sign as soon
as he began to hunt for it the sign
confirmed his fear that sam was in
some sort of jam not so long ago
four horses had been between the
house and the shed they had been
spirited horses mournful decided
and they had had an early-morning
friskiness

  mournful guessed that they had
been ridden in here soon after they
had been saddled and they probably
had been saddled at dawn two
hoofprints showed that one of the
horses had reared mournful could
see him stretching himself toward
the sky the indentations from his
hind hoofs were deep and ahead of
those were other indentations made
by the front hoofs as the animal had
dropped down about this sign
there was other sign made by horses
which had whirled and danced

  well sam hadnt come out of the
house on a horse mournful there-
fore went up the step and looked
at the ground the earth imme-
diately beyond the step had been
packed by the feet of people who
had sat upon the step farther on
the earth was softer there mourn-
ful saw the imprints of two heels

  stepping down he walked up to
these and examined them he be-
lieved that sam had stood just there
then had started back the imprints
of the soles were faint of the heels
rather deep it looked as if sam
might have thrown his body back to
avoid a blow mournful saw that
balanced on his heels he had twisted
about one heel had made almost
a ring

  walking slowly toward the cor-
ral mournful found footprints lead-
ing to it they were similar to the
prints made near the house and
mournful believed they had been

made by sams boots the prints
led into the corral but not out from
it they were replaced by the marks
of a horses hoofs the reading of
that was easy enough sam had
walked into the corral and had rid-
den a horse out

  the hoof marks led to a comer of
the corral there they were joined
by other marks which led from the
house again that was easy read-
ing the men who had sat horses
between the house and the shed had
ridden to the corner of the corral
and had met sam there following
the confusion of marks for a little
way mournful found that five horses
had been ridden away from the cor-
ral those five riders would be sam
and four other men

  one other fact was disclosed to
mournful the departure of those
men had been in a certain order
one man had ridden by himself
two of the others had ridden on one
side of him and two on the other
side in each case one of these riders
was behind the other therefore it
looked as if sam had gone away un-
der guard

  mournful now had about as good
an idea of the arrival of those four
horsemen and their departure and
sams as if he had witnessed it

  well he would have to find out
where old sam had been taken the
odds would be four to one but they
would have to remain so mournful
had no time to go back to butlers
to get help he had no inclination
to do so either odds of four to one
werent so bad -

out on the flat mournful lost
the sign several times but
found it again after a while
when he had covered two miles he
knew from the broken sign that the
riders were headed toward the moun-
tains he guessed then that the visit
you done me wrong

ill

of those riders had to do with wi-
leys cows the cows were still in
the mountain pastures awaiting the
round-up

  so mournful headed directly to-
ward the mountains he rode at an
easy lope so that he was able to
pick up the sign when it appeared
he came at last to the foothills
there were two draws leading into
the hills one draw was rather wide
the other narrow the wide draw
would be used by men going into the
hills on legitimate business because
it was the easier to ride into mourn-
ful just wondered whether these
riders wouldnt have picked the nar-
row draw they would be so in-
clined he believed if they were pull-
ing some sort of trick

  he therefore rode toward the nar-
row draw ten feet from it he dis-
mounted and went to it on foot

  ol-timer he informed himself
you still got a good guess or two in
your system you guessed which
draw them fellas would pick now
keep on guessin correct one bad
guess might get you inta trouble

  for he saw in front of the draw
prints which proved that the riders
had stopped there the sign out on
the flat had indicated that those
riders had pressed their horses that
had taken some of the friskiness out
of the animals they had been will-
ing to stand while their riders prob-
ably conferred among themselves or
questioned old sam then one by
one the horses had been sent through
the draw familiar now with what
he believed to be sams sign mourn-
ful saw that two riders had gone
ahead of sams horse and two behind
it

  those men were keeping sam un-
der their eyes all the time mourn-
ful wasted no more thought upon the
question of sams having been forced
to come here or of his having come

of his own accord there was every
indication that he had been forced

  for a full minute mournful stood
and listened there was no sound
from beyond the draw he guessed
he might as well ride in it was
possible that the riders gaining
these foothills had climbed one for
a backward view in that case they
had seen mournful arrive if he was
going to be held up he might as well
be in his saddle

 returning to his horse he
mounted and rode slowly to the
mouth of the draw as slowly he
sent the horse into it as the ani-
mal was about to poke its nose be-
yond the end of the draw it suddenly
nickered it was a low liquid
nicker and mournful was sure that
the sound had not carried far but
he stopped the horse leaned and
clapped a hand on its nose there
was no answering sound from be-
yond the draw mournful was sure
however that there must be horses
in there

slipping down softly he ad-
vanced and looked out into a
widening of the draw this
ran for perhaps a hundred feet and
then turned abruptly just this side
of the turn there were five riderless
horses one of the horses mournful
recognized as a roan which he had
seen old sam ride

  undoubtedly those four men had
gone into the extension of this
wider draw and had taken sam with
them they might be back at any
minute for mournful did not be-
lieve they would leave their horses
for long

  having scrutinized the draw
mournful looked up the higher
hills were just beyond him and
farther on the mountains began the
elevation of the mountains was not
much more than twice that of those


street  smiths complete stories

higher hills mournful had never
been up there but he supposed that
the summer grass was sufficient to
take care of bob wileys handful
of cows

  about to take his eyes from the
elevation he saw a sudden stir up
there a man at once came into
view he was followed by a second
man they stood facing the moun-
tains mournful waited briefly for
other men to appear -but none did
mournful returned to hiis horse and
backed it through the draw at the
outer end of the draw he dismounted
and ran back

  he was puzzled by the actions of
the two men he couldnt guess why
they had climbed the hills they
were not looking out over the way
they had come and they couldnt
see the mountain pastures where
mournful supposed wileys cows to
be for a moment after moumfuls
return they looked up then they
looked down one man raised an
arm and pointed below him then
he extended the arm and pointed
away from him to mournful it was
as if he indicated a direction

  dropping his arm this man turned
to the other mournful thought they
talked together then the first man
started to turn he turned slowly
as if he were giving whatever was
beneath him a lingering scrutiny
knowing that the second man would
probably also turn mournful
dodged back

  he knew he had a little time
those two men would require sev-
eral minutes to descend and to re-
appear at the spot at which they had
left their horses mournful then
decided that the mouth of the wider
draw was about opposite that spot
if they had been ridden through the
wider draw the horses would have
arrived where they now were

  running back to his horse mourn-

ful led him along the bases of the
hills till he came to the wider draw
dragging his reins again he stepped
into this draw the horses were al-
most immediately within his sight

  and fifty feet beyond the horses
their sides to mournful as they
gazed up the hillside were two men
mournful saw that they were await-
ing the return of the other two
moumfuls eyes went beyond them
leaning against the wall of a hill
was old sam old sams hat was
pulled over his eyes

  mournful believed that from be-
neath the brim sam was intently
watching those two men

chapter ii

listener

mournful looked behind
the two men the hills there
were lower and they were
devoid of vegetation their slighter
eminences would not be difficult to
reach but their barrenness would
offer no shelter to a climber how-
ever mournful decided to take the
chance he would have to hear what
those men said to each other when
the absent two rejoined the others
all mournful had to go on about
sam was sams watching those two
men sams scrutiny might mean
anything it might be merely hope-
ful or merely expectant

 into moumfuls mind had come a
thin ray of suspicion it was bom
of mournfuls knowledge that temp-
tation may come to any man he
had to remember that old sam after
a life of hard work was poor

  leaving the draw mournful found
that he could ascend an outside hill
without trouble his horse he
found was standing quietly it
would probably stand quietly for
some time unless disturbed so
mournful went up the first hill

com-a
you done me wrongt



crossing it he discovered that its
wall dropped down a dozen feet
sliding down he was still a con-
siderable distance above the level
upon which the men stood and he
was confronted by a steeper hill
this however had rocky outcrop-
pings by using these as handholds
he was able to gain the summit up
there other hills ran in undulations
to the hill which was his objective

  going as far back as possible so
that he should remain out of sight of
the men if either should look up
mournful went up and down till he
was above them then on his stom-
ach he crawled forward presently
he thrust his head beyond the rim of
the hill

  almost as if timed the two men
who had been on the other hill came
into view they were fifty feet from
the other two and as they advanced
mournful looked beyond them he
saw that they were emerging from a
blind draw it had a grassy floor
and from the condition of the grass
mournful believed that there was
water somewhere inside

  and all along the floor mournful
could make out groups of cows lying
down their appetites for water and
grass apparently satisfied for the
time being he thought that there
were about a hundred cows in all
and he had a notion that other cows
were beyond these

  as he was about to withdraw his
eyes some of the cows raised hind
quarters lazily and came to their
feet mournful could read their
brand-a flying w-and he knew
that those were wileys cows

  below him there was now the
sound of voices he looked down
the four men had drawn together
leaving old sam where he was sam
was leaning forward to hear what
the men would say

 one thing about sam struck
 com-a

mournful forcibly he didnt seem
to be a bit worried he was waiting
with apparent coolness the result of
the mens conference

  i guess the ol fella has give us
the right direction one man said
far as we could see fm the hill
we cn drive them cows out the way
he said gosh the shape theyre in
we cn be miles fm here by sun-
down

  well les get started another
man said

  as if moved by a common impulse
all four men turned dnd stared at
sam who did not stir once before
mournful had heard sam say that it
didnt matter a hell of a lot what
happened to him but now it seemed
to matter a great deal after a mo-
ment of inaction he slowly straight-
ened up and took a step toward the
four men

  stay where you are ol-timer
one of the men ordered

 as sam stopped he spread his
hands in a downward gesture to
mournful that gesture seemed to
hold a plea there wasnt the slight-
est defiance in him all the hardi-
ness which mournful had admired
in him in the past had vanished

 mournful could come to no deci-
sion about that it was very puz-
zling sam mournful knew wasnt
easily cowed he had lived too long
had passed through too many dan-
gerous experiences and yet after
that one gesture he seemed like a
broken old man even the glance
which had been so intent had become
a wavering thing

the four men put their heads
together they talked long
and earnestly then one
walked up to sam and pulled a paper
from his pocket

 you signed this paper didnt
you the man asked


street  smiths complete stories

 sam nodded

  an youre robert wiley

 again sam nodded

  mournful barely suppressed a be-
traying exclamation of amazement
sam posing as bob wiley was pos-
ing as the owner of the cows by
now mournful knew that the men
were going to drive the cows away
it looked as if they believed they
were buying them from the owner

 the man who had spoken to sam
seemed to prove this from an in-
side pocket he produced a small book
and a stub of pencil he wrote in
the book briefly then he handed
it and the pencil to sam

  sign your name he ordered

 sam wrote in the book mournful
saw that he wrote at the bottom of
a page therefore he wrote below
what the man had written mourn-
ful guessed that he was signing a
name the lanky puncher watched
the up and down movement of that
pencil too many movements sam
hadnt written sam tate mourn-
ful believed he had written robert
wiley

 the man took back the book and
the pencil and returned them to his
pocket from the same pocket he
drew out an envelope and handed
it to sam sam turned it over
mournful saw that it was not sealed
sam looked within

  why theres ony blank paper in
here he said

  blank paper the man repeated
youre crazy the amount of
money in that envelope is wrote on
the outside of it the amount in-
side corresponds to a cent to what
is wrote on the outside you aint
doubtin me are you ol-timer

  sam sadly shook his head and put
the envelope into a pocket the
man turned about to his companions
sam put a timid hand on his arm

 mister sam said you aint

keepin your agreement with me
when i agreed to sell you these

cows i was to get cash i-

 youre gettin cash-in the en-
velope now shut up

 mournfuls heart sank he con-
jectured that old sam had entered
into a raw deal and that he was now
being betrayed as he had betrayed
bob wiley

 well said the man sharply to
his companions

  not here one of the other men
said hell thatd be silly i been
tryin to figger this thing an i aint
got nowhere with it we gotta be
smooth about it

  they all bent their heads and went
into a study mournful thus had a
chance to observe them closely
without doubt they were all punch-
ers but there was something strange
about them they were somehow
different from ordinary men of the
range crooks that was it
mournful told himself they were
not men concerned with handling
cows legitimately they were used
to cooking up schemes mournful
sensed that difference

  it therefore looked as if old sam
had stepped into a great deal more
than he had counted on

 for a long time those men were
motionless except that now and
then one by one they looked at sam
as if sam himself might order their
thoughts sam over there all alone
merely drooped he seemed very
old no matter what he had done
mournful was sorry for him mourn-
ful feared he had got himself into a
trap by departing under temptation
from the path of honesty

presently one of the men
detached himself from the
others and began to pace up
and down he was a blond heavy
man he soon stopped near sam and
you done me wrong



stared at him he took off his hat
as if its removal would help him to
think mournful saw that he had a
wide ugly face with a loose cruel
mouth how had sam got hisself
hooked up to a man like that sam
was a pretty good judge of men

  all of a sudden the man squared
his shoulders he laughed and
slapped a thigh with his hat the
other men looked at him

  well i got it he said you
fellas is dumb wheres this ol
mans gun

  one of the other men produced
a gun and held it out the blond
man went swiftly over to him and
took the gun he broke it and ex-
amined it apparently it was loaded
to his satisfaction he snapped the
cylinder shut and stood looking at
the gun then he turned and looked
slyly at one of the other men that
man was the youngest of the four
he was not long out of his teens
mournful thought and he wasnt so
sure of himself as the others he
tried to bear the first mans scrutiny
without appearing to notice it but
he couldnt do it mournful saw him
stir uneasily

  i do bleve you could do this job
bettern any of the rest of us the
first man stated in fact i think
its just the job for you

  what job the young man fal-
tered

  this here said the other patting
the gun in his hand is this ol-
timers gun what if the ol-timer
was found lyin here dead when
somebody rides in lookin for these

cows hed be- the man

stopped as if a brilliant idea had
clutched him and stilled his speech
oh he cried i get better an bet-
ter he wheeled to the man who
had pocketed the book here
gimme that book he ordered

  when that man had passed over

the book the other opened it and
tore out several leaves he walked
up to sam and stuffed the leaves into
sams shirt pocket sam did not
move

  when the ol-timer is found dead
the bill of sale an the receipt for the
money will be on him the man ex-
plained course whoever finds him
will jde puzzled that he an not the
people he sold the cows to has them
papers but that wont be our worry
the more theyre puzzled the better
off well be cant you see an honest
cowman sayin that webought the
cows all right an that this ol fella
got conscience struck after we had
drove the cows off the honest
cowmanll be our friend if it comes
to a show-down by gosh honesty
pays though sometimes it dont
know who it pays

 he turned slowly back to the
young man

  come an get this gun he or-
dered an use it

  use it

  put it inta this ol-timers hand
and press it against his chest pull
the trigger as he falls keep hold
of his hand so his fingers will be
around the gun when hes found
drop down with him keepiig hold
of his hand let his fingers fix them-
selves around the gun see what i
mean aint it neat

  for sheer brutality mournful had
never listened to anything like that
as robert wiley sam appeared to
have sold wileys cows now he
was to be murdered with evidence of
the sale on his person these men
if they were caught could swear that
they had bought the cows from a
man they supposed to be their
owner they might even declare
in astonishment that sam must have
robbed them of the bill of sale and
the receipt

  for sheer brutality that younger


street  smiths complete stories

man had apparently never listened
to anything like that either he
could not stomach it in what
mournful supposed to be a panic he
sprang back and his hand dropped
to his gun his panic prevented a
sure draw besides the blond man
had sams gun in his hand there
was an explosion the younger man
dropped with a bullet in his chest
the blond man faced the other two

  i think ill just ask for volun-
teers for this job he said sams
gun still in his hand

  there was silence mournful
waited for one of the men to volun-
teer it was possible that that big
blond man would shoot still another
of his companions mournful had
no objection to the odds being still
further reduced

  but after a moment of hesitation
one of the remaining men moved to-
ward the blond man a hand out-
stretched mournful thought he was
going to accept sams gun and exe-
cute sam with it

  mournful pointed his gun down at
the blond man

chapter iii

interfered

the man who had moved to-
ward the blond man stopped
in front of him he was
much smaller than the blond man
yet mournful believed that he was
made of better stuff that might
have risen somewhat from the fact
that he was swarthy with dark hair
and heavy dark brows above eyes
almost black

  for a moment the two men re-
garded each other the second
mans face was grim the blond man
smiled it was not mournful
thought a sincere smile it seemed
to hold derision

  foster the second man said

youve acted a good deal like a
king ever since you an the rest of
us got together you seem to think
none of the rest of us has any nerve
ill show you how good my nerve
is gimme that gun an in a minute
youll see that ol fella layin on the
ground stiff with that gun in his
hand just like you want it to be

  foster did not hand sams gun to
the other man instead he thrust
out the hand that held it and its
muzzle went into the other mans
stomach a blazing look came into
the dark mans face then quickly
died he became motionless he
could control himself mournful
saw

  mebbe you got plenty nerve
woods foster snarled his grin
gone what you lack is brains
you thought i wasnt watchin you
huh hell i knowed three days ago
that you an me would hafta have a
show-down soon well this is the
show-down put up your hands

  woods could only put up his
hands the dead man on the ground
was an example of what would hap-
pen to him if he disobeyed

  gimme that rope sims foster
ordered

  sims was the oldest of the trio
now left he too was a little man
and mournful saw that he was easily
cowed foster had apparently es-
tablished himself and this man was
too helpless to question fosters au-
thority he was slight and sandy
and tremendously bowlegged his
spirit mournful thought was as
washed out as he seemed to be phys-
ically

  sims turned and picked up a rope
which was lying behind him
mournful understood that this man
foster was forehanded when he
had come in here he had brought a
rope probably he had believed that
he would have use for it with woods
you done me wrong



 sims walked around woods and
gave the rope to foster

  put your gun on him sims fos-
ter ordered

 sims poked his gun into woodss
back foster plucked out woodss
gun and dropped it on the ground

  you gonna string me u woods
asked and there was a slight tremor
in his voice

 foster mournful now saw en-
joyed cruel acts once more he
grinned and his grin was genuine
it drew his lips so far back that yel-
low decaying teeth were disclosed
the canine teeth were like a dogs

  string you up foster repeated
hell no im gonna let you die
peaceable well kinda peaceable
itll all depend on you ill make an
example of you

 he slipped the loop of the rope
over woodss head and drew the
loop tight walking around woods
he wrapped him with the rope
then unfastening the mans hand-
kerchief he gagged him

  woodss legs were free enough to
permit him to hobble and foster or-
dered him to the hillside beyond
sims there woods turned the
movement brought him face to face
with foster foster immediately
sent his right fist against the side of
woodss jaw woods was so tightly
bound that he could not collapse as
he leaned foster struck him again
a terrific blow woods went down
like an unbending tree his head
striking the hard ground with a good
deal of force he lay still

these brutal acts had created
a new mood in foster a mood
of oily cajolery still grin-
ning he turned to sims

  id take care of that ol man my-
self ony i know you wanta do it
he said i wouldnt keep no pleas-
ure fm you sims

  thats all right sims said ill
do it course ill do it glad to
do it for you foster

  for me for all o us dont you
mean sims were all in the same
boat aint we

  shore oh shore all in the
same boat you know i wouldnt go
against you foster

  foster handed sams gun to sima
weve wasted enough time he
said significantly

 sims started toward sam who
came erect that old man mourn-
ful saw would not plead he would
meet death with a high head and
with defiance in bis eyes for the
moment he was the sam whom
mournful knew

  mournful realized that he would
have to act promptly sims would
not delay in the execution of sam
his attitude showed that he disliked
the job but he would not resist
foster

  mournfuls gun was still pointed
down into the bowl he aimed it
at fosters heart the lanky puncher
was disgusted he had in his time
gone up against many brutal men
but he believed that foster took the
prize for brutality mournfuls con-
science would not have hurt him
much if he had sent a bullet into
fosters heart instead he called
down to the men
we got you covered make one
move an away you go hightailin
to hell

  the two men showed the differ-
ence in their make-up foster went
rigid his pride mournful believed
flamed in him his feeling seemed
to be resentment that any one should
have the insolence to interfere with
him sims drooped then swiftly
crouched as if he shrank together
to make of himself as small a target
as possible

  foster lifted his head and looked


street  smiths complete stories

up at mournful and the steady hand
with the gun in it

  you said we  he snarled you
are alone up there

  what difference that made to a
man with a gun aimed at his chest
mournful couldnt see his increas-
ing disgust hardened his face

  think i am he snapped well
i reckon thats in line with your
genrul thinkin both you an that
other fella put up your hands an
walk over to that hill an stick your
noses inta it you cn entertain
yourselves by nosin a coupla holes
in the rock

  i wont do it foster declared
were peaceable cowmen here on
business you aint got no right to

hold-

  mournful put a bullet through the
mans hat so far below the crown
that it must have stirred his hair

  ill give you a haircut an it wont
be a pretty one said mournful
ill even take some scalp with the
hair do what i tell you
seething with rage foster obeyed
sims dropped sams gun and fol-
lowed him by dropping the gun
the man seemed to want to prove
to mournful that his obedience was
the real thing

  sims mournful called drop
your own gun then take fosters
an drop it i gotta slide down this
hill ill come slow if either of you
makes a move ill shoot

  foster turned his head and glared
at sims sims hesitated then
dropped his gun and plucked out
fosters and dropped it the guns
fell near the bound man but he was
still unconscious from fosters ter-
rific blow

  ill kill you for this sims fos-
ter threatened

  what could i do sims whined
hell a gun aint no good to you
anyway

ournful started slowly
down the hillside it was
rather steep and his progress
was slow once he dislodged a stone
and it clattered down foster
swiftly turned his head he saw
mournful still making a slow de-
scent but mournfuls gun was on
him he turned back to the hill

 gaining the level mournful
walked up behind foster and sims

  whatre you tryin to pull off
mournful asked

  why this fella wiley sold us
some cows we come to get em
what objection you got to that

  mournful thought foster expected
him to deny that sam was wiley
he wouldnt do it he would give
foster something further to think
about

  oh mournful said this ol
fella tried to pull one on you did
he

  that was it he wanted to get
our money an keep the cows fm us

  the ol hellion mournful ex-
claimed well you got the cows
all herded ready fer a drive aint
you

  yes yes all we wanta do is to
get on our way we want to cover
as much ground as we cn by night-
fall

  foster started to turn mournful
prodded him with the gun foster
resumed his former position
mournful looked down at woods at
his feet woodss face was suffused
with blood there was a little stain
near his head his fall mournful
supposed had injured him his
breathing was difficult

  foster let loose a flood of explana-
tion which explained nothing in
different ways he said what he had
said before under cover of that
torrent mournful stooped and un-
tied the knots which held the gag
and the rope on woods he ran his
you done me wrong



finger around under the rope so that
it should be somewhat loosed and
permit woods blood to circulate
more freely it was merely an in-
stinctive act of mercy on mournfuls
part he didnt want any man crook
or otherwise to suffer unnecessarily

  standing up he interrupted fos-
ters stream of talk

  where was you gonna take them
cows he asked

  why to my ranch

  wheres your ranch

 why-why-er-

  oh you got one of them why-
why ranches have you well i
aint intrusted in that kind of a
ranch

  mournful turned about to sam he
had intended to speak gently to sam
but he found the old man glaring
at him sam mournful decided was
pullin the stuff that a caught man
sometimes pulled he was trying to
be virtuously indignant

  whats all this mean sam
mournful asked sharply what
you been tryin to do with wileys
cows

  you cn go to hell mournful
martin sam cried what i do is
my business an none of yours
mournful stared at the old man
sam was acting speaking as a
crook would have acted and spoken
mournfuls heart sank he could
understand what might have hap-
pened to sam bob wiley by mar-
rying dorothy butler had come into
partnership in an outfit so big that
it made his own outfit look pitifully
small he didnt need his few cows
sam needed em-needed the money
they would bring sam mournful
guessed had been wondering why he
shouldnt share in the prosperity
which had come to bob wiley
mournful sighed

  well you gonna stand there all
day sam snapped

  by gosh mournful thought there
was dislike in sams voice he was
mad because mournful had busted
up his plans sam proved that he
was at least mad

  you make me sick he declared

chapter iv

damn fool

cn i turn around i wanta
talk to you fella

 mournful moved back and told
foster that he and simsmight turn
around he ordered them to keep
their hands up

 foster when he had turned
studied mournful sims regarded
the ground he seemed to think that
since foster had got him into this
jam it was up to foster to get him
out

  why youre ony a puncher aint

  ony a puncher mournful re-
peated why punchers is natchers

glanced over his shoulder at sam
who glared at him that of man

ing to foster went on you know

vinced yourself that youre a clever

yond mournful to sam ol man
he contirtued his eyes threatening

  of your own free will
  cernly

  a wave of brightness flowed over
fosters face to mournful he
seemed overjoyed by sams re-
sponses as if sam had backed him
up more than he had expected

  sam mournful called have you
lost what little mind you had why
you didnt need to pull off nothin
like this wiley sent me lookin fer
you this mornin he was worried

about you he said he was gonna
look after ol sam he said you

suit o clothes an sendin you to

sam

  sam laughed he laughed so long
and so loudly that mournful again
turned to look at him by gosh
mebbe that ol fellas mind had
cracked ol fellas down on their
luck wasnt none too solid in their
minds sometimes

  shore sam said when he had
quieted his mirth bob wiley was
gonna look after me he was probly
gonna make me chief dishwasher
over at the butler ranch that

  sam sam mournful expostu-
lated

 sam sam the old man mim-
icked

shaking his head mournful
turned back to foster and sims
mister sims whined fos-
ter has got a lotta dough i dont
spose you got much why cant we
dicker nice an pleasant

  where did foster git his dough

 why-why-

 why-why- mournful jeer-

ingly echoed  why-why ranches
an why-why dough

  sims when i want you to do any
you done me wrongr



business for me ill let you know
foster said martin do you know
wiley

  wiley

  i cn see he aint no friend o
yours foster wheedled why
should you worry about him or his
cows 

  i reckon it must be because im
a natcherl-born worrier mournful
answered seems like all i do is go
around worryin jest now im
worryin about what im gonna do
with you

  you cant do nothin with me
foster cried i cn prove that ever-
thing ive done has been on the
level

  oh ill take your word fer that
said mournful gosh i spose ill
hafta take you way over to the
sheriff i hate to take anybody to a
sheriff me an sheriffs dont get
along so good

  you smart aleck foster ground
out

  mournful suddenly aimed his gun
at fosters chest again he so dis-
liked the fella that he was tired of
fooling with him foster stiffened

  ill have the truth outa you
mournful said when did you
herd wileys cows inta that blind
draw

  yesterday an the day before
where was you gonna drive em
to

  why to where we could dispose
of em o course we got a bill o
sale with wileys name on it
wrote by ol sam

  i dont know nothin about any
ol sam that ol man there is bob
wiley accordin to his own say so
thats all i know

 mournful could not decide
whether foster was telling the truth
or not the man had undoubtedly
been in jams before the fact that
he was here sound in limb proved

that he had wiggled out of those
jams he might be expecting to wig-
gle out of this one in any event
he acted as if he would not be scared
into an admission

  again mournful turned to sam
cmon sam he said straighten
me out on this thing

  straighten you out said sam
scornfully oh youre crooked
are you i alius thought so

  mournful was now convinced that
sam was merely putting up a front
sam must feel secure enough he
probably knew that wiley would no
more than regretfully reprimand
him nothing serious could happen
to him however mournful was
disappointed in him a few words
from him would have set mournful
straight

 wiley an me is pretty good
friends sam mournful said lamely
a word fm me to wiley would
fix-

  would fix me up sam inserted
so youd lie would you fella
sam im off you fer life mourn-
ful declared you talk about me
makin you sick gosh

  i hope you get sick enough to
die sam said viciously

  mournful turned back to foster
and sims he found fosters eyes
on him but the eyes were vacant
foster appeared to be using another
of his senses-his hearing mournful
himself listened intently he could
hear nothing then light broke for
him once more he covered foster
and now his eyes were bitter partly
from what sam had done and partly
from his dislike of foster

 i jest thought of somepn
mournful said i was a fool not
to think of it before i guess im a
fool fer foolin with you you got
some more men aint you theyre
with wileys cows you been lis-
tenin for them a while ago you


street  smiths complete stories

said all of us an i didnt tumble
tell me the truth now you sucker
im losin my patience want me to
blow you apart

  whos gonna blow who apart

  the voice had come from the top
of that hill upon which mournful
had first seen the two men briefly
mournful kept his eyes on foster
foster crouched as if he expected
mournful would pull his trigger
mournful couldnt do that it would
be murder of a sort and it wouldnt
benefit him

  he looked up two rifles were
pointed down at him beyond them
was a pair of bare shaggy heads
those heads mournful saw be-
longed to a couple of old-timers
mournful knew that he could not
fool with them they were prob-
ably too old to do anything on their
own hook they looked at foster
for their living their protection
they would wade through high wa-
ter and dash through the flames of
hell for him sometimes mourn-
ful knew that sort of thing served
better than loyalty

  slowly disgustedly mournful
holstered his gun and lifted his
hands

  you damn fool he murmured

               

chapter v

watcher

the two men came down from
the hill they paid no at-
tention to mournful their
eyes were on foster hungrily
shaggy ol men thought mournful
dumb ol men they were waiting
for fosters crumbs of praise they
did not depend upon foster help-
lessly as sims did they fawned
on him

  foster gave them no crumbs his
eyes were on mournful

 we thought somethin was

wrong boss one of the men said
we knowed you wouldnt waste
so much time here if somethin had
not happened so we snuck up on
the hill an peeked over an got this
fella you cn depend on us boss

  this fella got me foul when i
wasnt lookin foster said

 there were two guns on the
ground near him but he wouldnt
pick up one of them mournful
guessed the vain man wanted to keep
himself erect before his foe he
seemed to think that bending to
pick up a gun would rob him of
some of his dignity dignity hell
thought mournful the sucker was
merely bloated with his own conceit

  foster turned to one of the men

  gimme your short gun he said

  the man handed the gun to him
he held it in his left hand then
he began a slow advance on mourn-
ful he was mournful thought like
a stealthy enraged animal his
head was bent so that the lower
whites of his eyes showed and his
lips were drawn back to disclose his
yellow teeth

  fosters stealthy advance carried
him to within four feet of mourn-
ful his gun was aimed at mourn-
ful and his eyes did not waver at
that distance of four feet he
stopped

  then foster suddenly sprang it
was only a short hop carrying the
man to within two feet of mournful
foster had a long reach and he had
only to throw out a hand to smack
mournfuls face as mournful saw
the blow coming he threw his head
to one side so that the blow was
light foster however followed
that with a blow from his clenched
fist since he had lowered his hand
this blow came up from the waist
it caught mournful under the chin
just as he was straightening his
head
you done me wrong



  though his body rocked and his
head whirled he believed he might
have kept his feet however he
thought it best to fall he seemed
to go down heavily but in reality he
broke his fall by catching himself
with a long extended arm then he
drew his body together and curled
his arms about his head so that he
might protect himself if foster
booted him

 foster did not boot him he
stooped and snatched out mourn-
fuls gun then he rose and turned
to those fawning oldsters their
servility must have been like wine to
him he wanted their praise

  neat work boss one of the men
said takes ony one of your
punches to put a man away

  ill say so foster gloated
whatcha want us to do with him
boss the other man asked 

  mournful had long ago learned
that weak servile men could be dan-
gerous those two oldsters now
were more dangerous than woods
for instance they not only would
kill at fosters order but to get
further into fosters good graces
they would offer to kill

  id like to do plenty to him fos-
ter said but i guess i just gotta get
rid of him

 he turned to mournful again
mournful knew that he was tempted
to lose enough time to teach mourn-
ful a lesson but he decided against
that

  the backs of the three men were
now to woods the bound man
while foster regarded mournful
those two oldsters kept their eyes on
foster their mouths were half
open their eyes had the dim eager-
ness of age mournful pitied them
sometime they had been young men
strong men now they were dodder-
ing old duffers hanging to a brute
for their keep

  mournful now believed that fos-
ters cunning had returned the
man was deciding just what he
should do with mournful and sam
it must seem to him that he was in
complete control of the situation
thoughts of gain must be upper-
most in his sick mind mournful
guessed that he was wondering how
to dispose of his body so that it
should not be found he would take
care of sam as he had planned to
do but if mournful lay dead near
sam too much suspicion would be
aroused

mournful shot a glance at
woods he did not know
just why he did that it was
the mere roving glance of a man
taking in all the scene since the
scene might be the last which he
would look upon

  as his eyes alighted on woods
mournful barely controlled a start
woods had moved so that he could
look more fully at the backs of those
three men finding that he was not
observed he moved a careful arm
that disclosed to him that his bonds
were loose he quickly pushed
them down from his body thereby
freeing his arms twisting his head
from side to side he loosened the
gag which mournful had untied

  in that brief time mournful de-
cided that woods was a good man
gone wrong anyhow he knew how
to handle himself in an emergency
there was no blaze of hate in his
eyes they were cool and watchful
raising his head he caught sight of
one of the guns near him a quick
smile of satisfaction came to his lips

  his right hand went out slowly

  well foster broke the silence
you two fellas has been around here
moren i have you cn take this
long man some place an lose him
you cn take sims too i kinda


street  smiths complete stories

think sims aint gonna be of no use
to me fm now on an when i say
i want you to lose them two i mean
i want you to lose em i dont want
nobody never to find em

  one of the old men walked up to
fosters side

  boss he said this long man
didnt come here afoot he must
have a horse some place les get
the horse put him on it an take
him up in the mountains we cn
send him an the horse over a canyon
rim an if theyre ever found peo-
plell think it was an accident sims
too o course

  i was thinkin o that foster
said quickly go see where his
horse is yes i reckon thats the
way ill do it

  the two old men did not resent
fosters taking credit for the idea of
one of them so long as foster was
pleased they were satisfied they
walked up to mournful and with a
good deal of tugging heaved him to
his feet mournful drooped between
them for a moment and then as if
dazed lifted his head he looked at
foster with half-opened eyes

  what did you do to me fella
he muttered whatd you hit me
with

  foster laughed the old men
chuckled

  he hit you with his fist one
said dont he pack a wallop

mournful raised a hand
and ran it over his eyes be-
neath that cover he looked
again at woods woods had the
gun in his hand and was slowly com-
ing to his knees the rope dropping
from his body as he did so

  wheres your horse tall man
one of the oldsters asked

  at the end of the wide draw
mournful answered

  the two men released him and

stepped back they waited to see
whether he would fall but when he
kept his feet they trotted away and
disappeared into the draw

  foster you pup stick em up
woods kneeling was now facing
fully toward foster at the sound
of a voice which he thought silenced
foster went rigid a look of amaze-
ment dawned in his eyes mournful
drew himself together he did not
know what foster would do he
might in a sudden rage decide to
get rid of mournful at once

  but foster wheeled he still had
his gun in his hand and mournful
saw his elbow crook there was an
immediate explosion from where
woods knelt fosters hand went
down he took a backward step
wavered and collapsed heavily

  mournful ran to him and obtained
his own gun he aimed the gun at
woods woodss eyes were glued
to foster as if he thought foster
might rise his gun was pointed at
fosters body

  dont move woods mournful
ordered i got you covered i done
you-an myself-a good turn by
loosenin that rope them two ol
men will be cornin back soon we
better be ready for em

  woods looked up at mournful
whatever you say is all right
with me he stated you made a
chance for me thout that chance
id been dead in a few minutes
foster dont think nothin o snuffin
out a life ill stick with you till we
bag them ol devils

  i guess you better toss that gun
out to me mournful said and
when woods tossed it out he went
on to sam get it sam keep
woods covered

  as sam took up the gun mournful
ran toward the draw into which the
two old men had disappeared peer-
ing into it he saw that they were re-
you done me wrong



turning one of them leading moum-
fuls horse that man was on the
side toward mournful and the other
was still nearer

  mournful waited till they came
abreast of him then he poked his
gun at them

  they stopped halting the horse
also the two were not so bewil-
dered but that they put up their
hands they turned ludicrously
frightened faces to mournful

  you two oughta be in an ol mens
home stead o gallivantin around
killin people mournful said

  he took their guns and dropped
them on the ground

  now get your horses an ride hell
fer leather outa here he ordered

  the men fairly tottered to their
horses mounted them and spurred
them away their scared faces turned
back till they disappeared

  i guess you aint no sheriffs as-
sistant woods said hopefully
when mournful returned to him

  nope mournful agreed where
do you an sims go from here

  oh i dunno im gonna get me
a job

  i dunno whod give me a job
sims put in

  if you two wanta ride with me
mebbe wiley could fix you up

  this aint a trick woods asked

  hell i dont need to play no
tricks on you now

  ill take a chance say you
wanta know what this was all
about

  mournful looked over at old sam
sam was staring at him as belliger-
ently as a fighting cock just released
for combat mournfuls thin smile
went across his lips

  i wanta know all about it he
said but not fm you id rather
hear it fm that ol fella over there
i once thought he was my friend

  your friend old sam cackled

heh heh hell you dont know
the meanin of friendship youre

fellas you let ride away

  on the ride to the butler ranch
sam drooped in his saddle his eyes
on the ground mournful supposed
he was cookin up a story for wiley
near the house sam looked up his
face was flushed

  martin he said i am a crook
youll know it as soon as we see
wiley by gosh you will know it

the fortune maker

by cole richards

a monkey makes the business

smee clanged the compound
beh like a man gone mad
every indian on the hemp
plantation felt the coming
sting of leather lash or the
stocks rough clamps the men al-
ready in the stocks dominic gomez
among them had visions of solitary
confinement and starvation smee
ran plantation no  of the yucatan
sisal co with an iron hand through
the hemp rope from plantation
no  ran a thin red strand of the
indians blood smee despised the
peons and despising them pocketed
half of the fifty centavos a day the
company paid them he increased

this sizable fortune by selling one
third of the crop to independents

  it was his own crime not theirs
that caused him to clang the com-
pound bell a small stone may
break a large jar so runs the in-
dian proverb smees plan for skip-
ping out with his ill-gotten gains
was broken by the small circum-
stance of an auditors arrival a day
too soon the visitor an american
named waller had sent a messenger
ahead smee had an hour to get rid
of evidence of his brutalities and
thefts the clamor of the compound
bell was half a welcome half a knell
if the auditor were hot dusty and

com- a
the fortune maker



anxious to get away after a glance
at books and crop-if he accepted
smees word for the contents of a
certain lost ledger-he would ride
away safely if the auditor were
suspicious he would have to be
killed

  smees round skulking shoulders
twitched his shifty eyes rolled un-
der low brows

  dismantle stocks and lashing
pole he shouted when he had the
attention of the compound workers
prisoners go to field  this
was the field farthest from the com-
pound if one of you says more
than buenas dias to the senor who
is coming itll mean fifty lashes
after he goes sabe he got no
answer from the brown men who
cowered under their straw sombreros
and dug holes with bare toes
sabe he screeched

  si senor dominic gomez in the
stocks answered for all of them

  the plantation became an ant hill
disturbed by a brutal foot lashing
post and stocks were hauled on
mules into the jungle prisoners
were hustled out of the dark soli-
tary hut the place took on the air
of a model plantation run efficiently
and honestly

  a guard released dominics legs
and wrists from the wooden stocks
dominic stood up gingerly he
flexed his arms and stepped up and
down to take out the cramps a
plucky smile gleamed like ivory in
his mahogany face slack cotton
pants were fastened at his slim
waist by a twisted rope muscles
rolled on his back he had not
swung a machete on sisal hemp
since his fifth year for nothing

  the guard looked at dominic with
mixed envy and disapproval domi-
nic had dared hit smee with a bunch
of sisal when smee tried to tram-
ple his monkey dominic had done

 com-a

what every indian on the planta-
tion longed to do and what did it
bring him punishment

  the stocks are not hammocks
no the guard remarked next
time you will not strike the senor
when he kicks your monkey
dominics jaw set stubbornly
the monkey is my fortune maker
i said to senor smee i wish to
make a fortune as the americanos
do he said get yourself a mon-
key and hand organ  dominic re-
peated this solemnly neither he
nor the guard had a glimmer of
smees sarcasm if the senor said
it was so then it was so to those
simple mexicans

  i went to the jungle dominic
continued i captured a monkey
it makes a year now that i have
taught mono tricks when the se-
nor kicked him i could not help hit-
ting the senor mono will bring me
fortune with his tricks

 tricks tobacco smoke left
the guards nose in a snort you
taught him to steal mono enters
windows and opens drawers

  it was that i tried to teach mono
to go to windows for pesos domi-
nic explained simply i had no
pesos to practice with so i used
other things true he now gets
things for himself from the senors
house but i shall not have that trou-
ble in merida where pesos grow
like coffee berries

  mono will get you killed before
you see merida tine guard prophe-
sied

p risoners in big straw hats
and sloppy whites formed a
double line where the stocks
had been they set their feet flat
on the ground to brace their wabbly
knees great red bruises glared on
brown wrists and ankles they
stared solemnly and listlessly at the

guard he shifted the heavy  on
his slim hip

  remember the senors order he
shouted say buenas dias to the
visiting senor and no more for
each word more-fifty lashes

 two by two the barefooted line
shambled out of the hot compound
a jungle of great trees vines as
thick as a mans arm and tangled
underbrush made a matted screen
along the edge of the cleared acre-
age the sisal hemp grew in even
dark-green rows dotted with white
specks where men women and chil-
dren swung their machetes

 dominic gomez shuffled at the
rear of the column his file mate
limped badly from a cramp he
stumbled frequently vhen the guard
hurried him dominic watched the
matted screen of palms and bamboos
until he saw an opening beside a
mahogany tree he thrust out his
foot his crippled file mate stum-
bled and fell in a heap the guard
bent over him

 dominic slid behind the mahog-
any tree scuttled under a banana
plant and squirmed through a net
of vines a shout went up the
guard crashed around in the under-
brush dominic watched him from
behind the vines the guard
squirmed uhder the banana plant

 dominics teeth made a sinister
ivory line in his mahogany face he
formed a noose of a supple vine the
thickness of a lead pencil he
waited for the guard to push his
head through the net of vines the
noose was head-high ready to be
converted into a strangle knot

 the guard gave up the hunt ab-
ruptly to admit he had lost a pris-
oner was to become a prisoner him-
self he cried adelante the
double file shuffled away a bird
broke into song the chuck chuck
of machetes on sisal was doubly

pleasant because dominic felt he
was hearing it for the last time

 the visitor who threatened ruin
to smee promised fortune to domi-
nic like so many mexican indians
dominic was lost after he got fifty
miles from home merida was four
times that distance he had not
the least idea how to get there but
he had a childlike faith in the visi-
tor he would ask the new senor to
take him to merida and it would
be done

 dominic went to his windowless
thatched hut he was welcomed
joyfully by a capuchin monkey a
foot high with an almost human face
peering anxiously from a frill of
white fur mono jingled his chain
and chattered to be freed

 no dominic said firmly if
you run loose youll have me in
trouble they say you will get me
killed before i see merida what
do you think of that

 the indian bathed then dressed
in clean white shirt and pants and
leather sandals when he had
wound a bright-red sash around his
slender waist stuck a machete
through it and put on his big hat
he was a fine fellow

 dominic paused in the doorway
smee was emerging from a thatched
hut with barred window where pris-
oners were confined for solitary
starvation he carried a short-han-
dled shovel he had buried the
ledger which he would say had been
lost without that ledger the audi-
tor could suspect to his hearts con-
tent but he could not prove the
embezzlements smee left the
shovel against a palm tree and re-
turned to his own house

 dominic waved a jaunty hand at
mono be good mi probecito no
i cannot free you a small stone
can break a large jar i would not
have you get me in trouble to-day
the fortune maker



  mono chattered and whimpered
he threw himself against the collar
only once then he got busy at the
staple that fastened the chain to the
hut wall

three horsemen-an ameri-
can and two natives-trotted
out of the jungle trail
dominic hurried to get to the house
at the same time the visiting senor
got there it took nerve to escape
the punishment gang and to walk
boldly up to smees house but domi-
nic knew of no other way to talk
with the visitor and he had to get
to merida as waller dismounted
the resplendent dominic strolled
around an hibiscus tree and halted
in the piazza he was unnoticed by
smee who was shaking hands with
his unwelcome guest

  the two americans meeting for
the first time took each others meas-
ure smee rated the lion-headed
easy-mannered waller as a man of
strict justice and frank speech
waller rated the hunched shifty-
eyed smee as a schemer and thief

  waller cast an experienced eye
over the miles of sisal plants he
looked with understanding at the
newly filled holes where stocks and
lashing post had been he turned
to dominic

  how much do you earn
twenty-five centavos a day
dominic answered automatically
he failed to notice wallers accus-
ing so and smees start of guilt
and anger what did the twenty-
five centavos matter to dominic who
was about to make a fortune his
lips formed the word merida

  had he shifted his eyes just then
to his own hut he would have seen
mono with tail curled up jauntily
and chain clinking the monkey
loped toward smees sala window
when smee saw who answered

waller his face became livid
dominic had struck him had es-
caped the punishment gang and now
boldly appeared on the piazza smee
controlled his anger come in and
have a drink waller cool off

  im cool enough waller said
brusquely ill look at your books
then ride over the plantation
youre delivering about two thirds
of the sisal you should be getting
off this place and the boy here
seems to think he gets twenty-five
centavos where it should be fifty

  you dont think irh holding
out smee said with a dangerously
polite smile

  i hope not

  smees eyes shifted from side to
side they lit on dominic and
pigeonholed him for the fall guy in
case murder should be necessary

  the books are in the sala come
in waller

  nothing in smees checkered ca-
reer fitted his plans as well as the
events of the next few minutes

  there came a shrill screech of a
house girl and a babble of indian
invectives the rattling of a chain
and then sounds of breakage the
chain clattered on the tile floor
mono burst out the door a long
green paper streamed from his
mouth

 oh mi pobrecito dominic
whispered youve opened drawers
again

 give me that you thieving
devil smee snarled he snatched
at the green paper

  a sidewise spring landed mono
in the crook of wallers arm wal-
ler gentled him with a pat on the
head and released the green paper

  railroad and steamer ticket he
commented vacationing

 that monkeys a damn nui-
sance smee answered i can ex-
plain the ticket

a passing field worker had
stolen up for a look at the
visitor he idly swung a sisal
machete smee seized the machete
he jerked the monkey backward out
of wallers crooked elbow hold-
ing the squirming monkey at arms
length he swung the heavy blade

  dominics brown hand flew to the
machete stuck in his red sash the
machete cut a gleaming arc and came
to a stop with its sharp edge against
smees neck smee froze with his
arm up

 muttering youre a savage
dog he dropped the monkey

 dominic lowered his weapon
smee instantly chopped at him
dominic snapped his blade upright
in a swift parry steel rang on
steel smee tried to lock the
knives a push a flirt of the wrist
a side-step and dominic was free
smee struck at him dominic had
been on the defense now he
lunged into battle with the speed
of an expert machete man

  sunlight dripped off his flashing
blade there was a light chuck
and blood dripped where the sun-
light had been smee gave a stifled
cry as the weapon bit his arm he
slashed viciously at dominic again
the blades rang again smee tried
to hold and dominic freed himself

  dominic drove in playing the
machete now to keep smee con-
stantly parrying while he tried for
an opening to knock the machete
from smees hand smee backed
dominic was almost toe to toe with
him the knives locked it would
take only a twist of the indians
wrist to snap the machete out of
smees grasp

  a fist hit the back of dominics
neck everything went cloudy
though dominic kept his balance
he was unable to move handor foot
waller disarmed both men

  youre pretty fast with that
thing my man he said sharply to
dominic

  dominic tried to say that he was
only disarming smee instead he
stammered mono is my fortune
maker true he opens drawers
but in merida-

  dangerous fellow smee inter-
rupted no intelligence like a
savage dog when the monkey is
caught stealing dominic always
outs with the machete he signaled
the guards

  waller folded and pocketed the
railroad ticket so you were ready
to skip out and a monkey tripped
you up theres a mexican proverb
about a small stone but i cant re-
member it now

  smees eyes went red he wanted
to attack the big man outright with
a machete but that was foreign to
his wily nature the murder would
come by gunshot when waller
thought he was safest it would
come only when smee was forced
to it so far the railroad ticket
and dominics statement about his
pay were not real proofs of embez-
zlement the ledger of proof was
buried deep in the hut of the barred
window

  four men dragged dominic away
waller was still trying to recall his
proverb when smee opened the
books on the table

in the hut of the barred window
dominic sank down on the dirt
floor a chain rattled on the
wall mono thrust his tiny white-
ruffed face through the bars he
entered and tugged at dominics
arm with loving chuckles and
whines

  why did you do it pobrecito
didnt i tell you a small stone may
break a large jar you have broken
me this day mono
the fortune maker



  the discouragement was short-
lived

  mono listen to your papa
dominic said eagerly we must
follow the visiting senor to merida
we cannot talk with him now this
floor is of the dirt senor smee left
a shovel against a palm bring me
that shovel sabe mono

  mono was trained to bring some-
thing when dominic said bring
the trouble was to get him to bring
what was wanted dominic dug
with his hands in the corner where
he found some loose earth mono
was quick to imitate him when
the monkey was hot at the work
dominic pushed him through the
window bars and said

  bring

  the shovel against the palm was
the only movable thing in sight the
monkey walked sedately around the
base of the palm he raced up the
palm chattered hurled dates at
dominic and raced down then
wonder of wonders he picked up
the shovel which was almost as big
as himself and carried it to the hut
mono was small the shovel was
stubby

 mono held it up dominic
reached through the bars he
stretched his arm down until his fin-
gers hurt with the effort the cold
edge of the shovel wavered against
his fingers he gripped it and
pulled it slowly and carefully
through the bars

  a place to dig was easy to find
some other prisoner apparently had
tried to get out in one corner the
earth was loose some one had re-
filled a hole and trampled it down
dominic dug industriously by the
time he stopped to take breath he
had opened a hole twelve inches in
depth

  he went to the window no one
was near the hut some children

and dogs played in the peon row
two old women on their knees
ground corn in stone mortars the
grating of stone on stone covered
the sound of his digging

  from the house came the senores
voices raised in argument-smees
rapid with explanation wallers
stern with justice gradually the
voices changed smee became
smoothly confident while waller
was baffled smee was wily he
had fixed up the books waller
could see things with his eyes that
he could not prove with the books
an american would have known by
their voices that something was up
dominic was utterly unaware that
any one but himself was trying to
get out of a tight place

  he returned to his digging at
the first stroke the shovel hit some-
thing solid he tried to dig around
it and could not he tried to dig
through it and could not he
thrust his hand in the hole and
brought up a book dominic opened
it the pages of writing and fig-
ures were so many hen tracks to
him he touched a dirty finger to
the black tracks in their red fences
and was surprised to discover that
he could not feel them he flipped
a page and tried again as his hand
moved down the page a streak of
sunlight fell across it a man said

  you can see for yourself theres
no torture connected with this cell

  smee and waller were inside the
hut each of them instantly grasped
the meaning of shovel and hole
smee went for the ledger but wal-
ler was quicker he ripped it from
dominics limp hands waller held
the open book in the bend of his
arm he flicked the pages reading
aloud an item here an entry there

  the lost ledger he said sternly
maybe we can straighten this thing
out now steamer ticket buried


street  smiths complete stories

ledger acres of planting that dont
jibe with your reports of the returns
of sisal

 i wasnt knocking out smee
said quickly things were bad i
tried to cover up give me a chance
i can get this plantation out of the
hole

  im afraid the plantation is like
the ledger smee you put it in the
hole i had hoped to get out of
here this afternoon but ill have to
stay to-night

  smees shifty eyes were flicked
with red nothing would please
me more than to have you stay to-
night if he added youre not
afraid dominic is devilishly clever
at escape hes more expert with a
gun than with the machete

  ill chance him

 they turned to go smee had the
shovel waller the ledger mono
scampered into the hut smee
booted him out the monkey fled
wildly toward the jungle

 waller was saying theres a

proverb about a small stone-

when the door was locked on domi-
nic

 dominic went back to the hole
when the loose earth was all out
he met unyielding earth he dug
until his fingers were bleeding and
too sore to go on supperless he
lay on the dirt floor until the moon
set the peons fires died and gos-
sips voices waned the gossips had
had a full evening telling how
dominic escaped the punishment
gang only to be caught when mono
stole the green paper

 women spoke of his macheting in
admiration men laid bets on his
probable punishment the guard
from the stocks flattened his face
against the bars to repeat his asser-
tion that mono would get dominic
killed with his thefts and general
cussedness

at midnight dominic sat up
suddenly he had heard a
scuffling in the compound a
step so light a white man would not
have heard it it was smees quick
stealthy walk smee carrying a
lantern crossed the compound and
unlocked the hut door dominic
stood with his back to the wall
through the barred window he had
seen smees lead-tipped quirt by the
light of the lantern

  smee entered he lugged in the
flat-topped table he used as a desk
the table had a drawer as mono
had once demonstrated to dominics
sorrow earlier in the evening the
drawer had held a paper which
would have surprised dominic if he
could have read it it was a report
to the head office it told how smee
had shot dominic after the indian
used a gun on waller this report
was now in smees pocket the
drawer contained a heavy  two
small iron braces and a leather tool
kit

  a job for you dominic i want
the gun clamped to the under side
of the table and wires run from
the trigger to the drawer so that
when the drawer is opened the gun
fires sabe he carefully went
into detail telling how to place the
gun how to screw in the braces set
the wires and carve out firing port
i should do it myself but youre
handier at these things than i am

  it is with the sadness that i see
my monkey get your paper this
morning senor it was a lucky pa-
per no but i could not have mono
killed it is with him i intend to
make my fortune as you suggested
senor

  oh forget the damn monkey and
get to work the ledger caused
more trouble than the ticket did

 mono and i wont bother you
much longer senor
the fortune maker



  no smee agreed you wont
he repeated all his instructions
it did not occur to dominic to won-
der how the gun would be used
he could think of only one thing at
a time right then he was think-
ing of getting to merida with his
fortune maker

  how long will that job take
dominic

 a short time a very short
time

  that means all night be done
before the dawn or youll take fifty
lashes he stole out and turned
the key noiselessly in the lock

  dominic fondled screw drivers
and chisel while he listened to smee
crossing the compound then he
went to the door he chiseled away
enough wood to get at the hinge
screws the screws he loosened suf-
ficiently to work them out with his
fingers his escape prepared for
he got to work on the gun

  the setting of the gun took every
minute of the allotted time his
torn bloody fingers moved clumsily
on the delicate job of fastening the
trigger with wires he had just got
the drawer back in the table when
he heard smee coming

  dominic opened the drawer and
listened to the click of a firing ham-
mer on an empty chamber he
clacked his tongue in admiration it
was a pleasant sound the senor
was indeed a smart man

  smee opened the door noiselessly
doors in the tropics frequently sag
he did not notice the loose swing of
the hut door he stood hunched
over swinging the lead-tipped quirt
he gave the indian a sidewise glance
from under lowered brows
finished

  finished senor

 dominic demonstrated smee
grunted to hide his satisfaction
murder by gunshot when waller

thought he was safest-he licked his
lips he carried the murder table
out and locked the door

  two minutes later dominic stole
from the hut

dawn was waiting to pop
over the horizon dominic
went to his own hut in the
peon row he crammed himself full
of tortillas and coffee extra tor-
tillas went into his shirt his guitar
hung beside the door he was ready
to follow the visiting senor to
merida

  he lacked only his fortune maker
mono

 with an eye out for smee he
made the rounds of the huts where
mono was wont to come for tit-
bits no one had seen the monkey
since smees kick sent him into the
jungle dominic hunted in every
conceivable hiding place mono was
not in the stables not in the sheds
not in the palms

  to the frequent question how
did you get out dominic answered
the senor freed me the indians
heard in unbelief when the time
came to go into the sisal fields no
one left they lingered hopefully
their morbid hopes were fulfilled
when smee went to the hut of the
barred window

  he bolted back to the compound
bell the bell clanged out an ur-
gent alarm a long stroke and three
short ones-prisoner escaped kill
if you must

  smees round shoulders twitched
at every pull on the rope every
indian who saw his shifty eyes un-
der lowered brows whispered that
dominic was as good as dead

  the bell halted dominic in his
search of the orange grove it
froze him in his tracks he had
heard that distinctive single long
and triple short strokes five times
	street  smiths complete stories

during smees management he had
seen smee shoot down two of the
escaped men on sight dominic
turned longing eyes to the jungle
so near so filled with hiding
places

 of what good is it to go with-
out mono shall i spend another
year training a monkey to go to
windows for pesos

 he resolutely took up the hunt
and was soon rewarded by finding
a half-eaten orange and a banana
skin mono had passed by here
another banana skin lay in the open
compound dominic lingered among
the heavily laden orange trees

 a party of machete men led by
a guard trotted into the date palms
across the compound a similar
group took the jungle trail an in-
dian rang the compound bell at in-
tervals to warn that a dangerous
prisoner had escaped

 the heavily laden orange trees
framed two sides of the compound
smees palm-thatched house was not
twenty feet away from where domi-
nic stood the house boy leaned
out the window shouting threats at
the thatched roof

 mono has been in there domi-
nic drew a breath to risk one call
for the monkey it was not neces-
sary

 an orange hit him full in the
chest on the roof mono chattered
at his joke and dared dominic to
try to hit him with an orange
dominic beckoned with a crooked
forefinger mono chuckled domi-
nic plucked an orange and held it
up enticingly mono scratched the
white ruff around his anxious face
he ran back and forth seeking a
way down he who could climb the
log walls anywhere

  the compound bell tolled pris-
oner escaped the men who had
searched the palms loped down the

sisal rows their oiled shoulders and
sharpened machetes glistening in the
sun on the roof mono ran out on
the projecting beam ends and went
over the edge out of dominics
sight

  the house boy had left the bed-
room window the sala window
was open but no one appeared in it
dominic took a long chance that
no one in the house would see him
he broke from the orange trees and
scurried to the house wall where he
slid under a purple buginvillaea
vine beside the window he stole
one glance into the sala before go-
ing onto the piazza what he saw
rooted him to the spot

waller lounged in the far
window smee was seat-
ing himself at the fiat-
topped table with the gun drawer
smees back was to dominic the
door at his right was out of his
line of vision in the door stood
mono watching smee with the curi-
osity that humans always rouse in
monkeys

  dominic moved the orange up and
down to catch monos quick eye
without attracting wallers atten-
tion the monkey gave him a bored
glance mono looked very small
there in the door when his minia-
ture human face in its white ruff
became intent and earnest he looked
smaller than ever

 dominic whispered bring
mono bring

  ive admitted it smee was say-
ing what more do you want i
sold company sisal to independents
and took half the peons wages sit
down here he pointed to the
chair opposite him that chair was
directly in front of the muzzle of
the hidden 

  i dont care to bargain thanks
waller answered
the fortune maker



  smees fingers stole lightly over
the knobs on the drawer he
hunched closer to the table and
gazed sidewise from under lowered
brows

 you wont go to the company
with that information waller

  why wont i

  youll know he waved toward
the chair sit down he invited
slyly

  waller got up like a prize fighter
leaving his corner he grasped
the chair top to pull it out far
enough to sit down smees hands
fluttered over the drawer knobs if
waller would sit down the gun muz-
zle would be within three inches of
his stomach a deadly and quite cer-
tain shot

  waller didinot sit down at once
hand on chair he glared down at
smee

  the buginvillsea vine shivered
under dominics trembling the
visiting senor could see mono
plainly if he turned his eyes from
smee he might see dominic too

  now mono looked at dominic in
answer to the whispered bring
the monkey looked around the room
for something to bring the table
where smee sat was the only table
in the room the only place where
mono could get anything but
mono was not going to approach
any place where smee was

  for once smee did not shift his
glance his quick ear had heard a
rustling in the window vines and
an urgent whisper bring mono
with dominic at the window and
waller about to sit down things
were running as smoothly as an
oiled gun he coolly returned wal-
lers stare and pointed at the mur-
der seat

  waller ordered get that ledger
again dont try to look me down
get the ledger

  ill bring it sit down smee
hurried into the next room

  waller remained standing deep
in thought as soon as smee came
in he would sit down and face the
wily thief across the table you
wont go to the company with that
information wouldnt he

smee appeared in the door
moving in his quick stealthy
way waller drew the chair
out a little way a white frill
showed over the table edge monos
anxious face bobbed up and bobbed
down he was in smees chair try-
ing to open the drawer to get some-
thing to take to dominie it was a
little harder to open than usual
mono threw all his strength into a
tug the drawer opened so sud-
denly he was toppled off the chair

  the blast of a  echoed from
wall to thatched roof the lion-
headed waller got a foolish expres-
sion on his face just below his
hand there was a hole in the chairs
wicker back a swirl of gray smoke
drifted up from under the table
edge before the bullet struck the
far window ledge waller cried

  so thats why i wouldnt be able
to tell

  his fist caught smee flush in the
jaw smee collapsed just as the
terrified mono went through the
window into dominics arms

  dominic turned to run the vines
seemed to come to life they
clutched his feet and twined around
his shoulders he kicked and
plunged he fought through and
stepped into the open twenty feet
away were the orange trees and be-
yond them the jungle but the jun-
gle was not for dominic

  two powerful hands hauled him
into the sala and dropped him limp
on the tiled floor

  the senor will forgive the mon-


street  smiths complete stories

key dominic begged he is of
the so-little sense but he is going
to make me the fortune as the
americanos make it with a hand
organ only i havent the hand or-
gan and must use a guitar

  who told you that bunk wal-
ler asked

  senor smee

  hm-m-m in one of his sarcastic
spells and you didnt know it of
course americans make money
growing things like sisal dominic
i dont blame you for using the ma-
chete on smee i know the marks
of lashes and stocks you stay here
and all will be forgiven youve
got back pay coming

  but i was to make a fortune in
merida he protested

 what do you consider a for-
tune

  dominic figured rapidly and set
a high figure fifty pesos senor

  fifty pesos twenty-five dollars
i guess my life is worth that much
mono earned it when he opened the
drawer

  as he counted out the silver wal-
ler asked dont you indians have a
proverb about a small stone

 we say a small stone may break
a large jar

  thats it

 dominic did not understand how
the proverb applied he did not
know of smees plans for theft and
murder even after the gun went
off he did not know wallers death
was intended with solemn cour-
tesy he accepted the silver which
mono had earned he was too
well-bred to betray his amazement
wonders never end where ameri-
canos are concerned

 who would have thought the vis-
iting senor would pay fifty pesos
just to see a monkey do a trick

tricks in the animal kingdom

many ruses are devised by men to get others to do their work
man has also perfected many systems by which he can make
animals perform his labor the most notable example being the
chinese fishermans method of training the cormorant to fish however
long before the cormorant had been trained to perform the fishermans
labor the bald eagle was forcing the fishing hawk into similar service

  some birds also are clever strategists chief of these being the cassowary
the cassowary a large bird and a near relative of the ostrich is supposedly
a dry-land bird but it is known to go occasionally to the water questing
for food it wades into a shallow stream squats down then spreads and
submerges its heavily plumed wings after remaining quite still for
several minutes it steps to the bank shakes itself and hastily devours
the small fish which it has caught in the effective net formed by its feathers


cyclops

by g h coxe

his real name was jose
tavares he drifted
into the lumber camp at
black lake late one
november afternoon
and we first saw him when he entered
the dining room that night he
stood there in the doorway uncer-
tain and awkward trying to find a
place that was vacant

  our outfit was made up for the
most part of backwoodsmen of one
sort or another americans swedes
french-canadians a russian or two
we were used to having strangers
drift in almost every type from the
college boy who comes during vaca-
tion to the city bum who stays two
or three weeks and then moves on

  but this man was different he

was dressed in a tight-fitting blue
suit pinched in at the waist and he
wore patent-leather shoes although
he did not appear to be much more
than thirty his black hair was
streaked with gray and plastered
back on his head he was slender
and sick-looking his face a gro-
tesque mask

  one dark eye blinking at us out
of a dead-white face made me think
of a marble in a cake of soap the
other eye socket formed a terminal
for a wide livid scar which ran
down to the corner of his mouth
making it a leering slit the nose
was twisted the entire face seemed
to be a pitiful repulsive example of
plastic surgery at its worst

  he must have stood there a full


street  smiths complete stories

minute yet no one in the room so
much as lifted a fork even when
he finally stepped around the nearest
table and dropped into a vacant place
the silence continued if anything
the tension increased some one
should have told the fellow he had
buck walterss place but no one
did

  walters swung into the room a
chesty confident figure in corduroy
and flannel he was a big man an
inch or two over six feet and weigh-
ing close to two hundred he turned
toward his seat then stopped short
as he saw the stranger the grin on
his red weathered face turned to a
scowl

  walterss action was uncalled for
but to us it seemed ordinary
enough he was the straw boss of
the mill yard a natural leader and
something of a bully not vicious
but a bully nevertheless he would
have done the same thing to any one
that he did to tavares i dont think
he did it to be nasty probably he
never gave a thought to his conduct

  he walked up behind the fellow
who was buttering a slice of bread
winked at us then reached down and
fastened a big thick-fingered hand
in the mans collar he lifted him
right out of the seat and stood him
on the floor

  youre in the wrong pew buddy
he grunted

  tavaress face went gray and his
one eye narrowed why didnt you
say so he asked id ve let you
have it

  im sayin so now walters
glowered at the sudden comeback
he took tavaress slender arm and
pushed him aside the man resisted
and walters put both hands on the
fellows shoulders and steered him
out of the way-or started to then
he seemed to freeze to the spot

  tavaress voice ripped through

the room back up jack back
up

  then we saw why walters stiff-
ened i dont know where it came
from or how he got it out but there
was an automatic in tavaress hand
and he held it right up against wal-
terss stomach

  i guess there were forty of us in
the room at the time and not one of
us made a move or uttered a sound
walters started backing nothing
had been said about his hands but he
lifted them nevertheless tavares
followed him to the wall then said
apologize jack or start praying
he didnt raise his voice didnt
try to accent it yet the menace
was there walters looked stunned
his lips moved but made no sound

  sam carmody came out of the
kitchen he was boss of the un-
skilled labor and his wife ran the
mess for us he was a squat barrel-
chested fellow but he moved toward
tavares with catlike quickness he
made no attempt to grab the gun
he just said

  we dont go in for that kind of
stuff here fella

  tavares hesitated then stepped
back carmodys lip curled as he
continued if i vas you cyclops
id clear out of here right now while
you got your health but if you
stay put that gun in your room and
keep it there if you dont theyll
take you out of here in pieces

our rooms were in an old ram-
shackle summerhouse and
there vas an extra bed in my
room when i went upstairs that
night i found cyclops in that bed

  so ive drawn you eh cyclops
i said i used his nickname natu-
rally enough and thought no more
about it until after i was in bed

  carmodys apt seizure of that
name had appealed to the men i
cyclops



doubt if more than ten of them knew
its significance but that made no
difference it was a new name to
them it was easy to say and they
used it

  the men did a lot of mean things
to cyclops in the next few months
but i doubt if anything was meaner
than the constant use of that nick-
name because he too knew where
it came from i was a checker and
makeshift timekeeper for the outfit
and i saw a lot of cyclops that win-
ter i dont think he ever got used
to that name it seemed to me that
he flinched every time any one called
him

  to have a repulsive face like that
was bad enough to be constantly re-
minded of the fact would be a bitter
pill even for a hardshell like wal-
ters i had no sympathy for tavares
then as a man but before i
dropped off to sleep i decided i
would not call him cyclops any more
-to his face

  about midnight i awakened with
a start the room was pitch dark
and in that blackness cyclops was
pacing the floor in his bare feet mut-
tering to himself cursing under his
breath i listened to the slap-slap
of those bare feet until i was thor-
oughly awake then i began to get
mad

 what in hells the idea i
snapped

  i cant sleep

  well i can if youll let me
gwan back to bed

  there was a sound of movement
on the other bed the springs
creaked silence settled over the
room again and i turned over and
closed my eyes then his bed
creaked again i knew cyclopss
lips were moving could hear them
smacking together as though he was
sucking a piece of hard candy

  i finally got up and lighted the

lamp then i sat on the edge of the
bed and scowled at him

  what the hells the matter with
you anyway

  guess he rapped

  and i did guess for a long time
the almost insane glow in his eye
the twitching of his leering mouth
the pallor of his face finally gave
me the answer

  dope i said id never seen a
man like that before not in that con-
dition but id read enough to un-
derstand something about what he
was going through

  he got out of bed and began pac-
ing the floor again and he was like
a scarecrow in underwear i
havent got a dime he moaned im
eating on credit until i get a job at
the mill i cant buy the stuff-and
i cant get out

  he quieted down a bit then i
went to sleep when you work from
six to five in a lumber outfit you
have to have sleep

naturally buck walters
did his best to make life mis-
erable for cyclops i guess
nobodyd ever pulled a gun on him
before there were plenty of -s
in camp but not many side guns we
had no use for them and walterss
humiliation had taken place in front
of all of us carmody gave cyclops
a job-twenty-six cents an hour we
started at in those days-and wal-
ters gave him hell

  that first day in the yards nearly
killed him he passed out cold about
two oclock on one of the lumber
piles walters came by while two
of the fellows were trying to bring
cyclops around walters told them
to get back to work he walked to
the mill got a fire bucket and doused
the whole pailful of water on cy-
clops

  at three oclock walters had to


street  smiths complete stories

repeat the performance and this time
cyclops couldnt stand up walters
pulled him off the pile and dropped
him down to the ground

  well dock you for these two
hours he said

  after a half hour cyclops got to
his feet and staggered back to the
house he was sleeping when i got
there and he didnt awaken until the
next morning i guess that rough
treatment and the sleep saved him

  utter physical exhaustion the next
couple days did more than anything
else could have to break his habit
he was like a ghost he jumped at
the slightest noise and his face
twitched constantly but he slept
nights and began to eat something

  walters must have sensed cyclops
was a dope addict because on the sec-
ond night he was holding forth
among the pinochle players down in
the front room we used for reading
and cards

  that wop is a doper he said
you can tell by looking at him
somebody said then what did he
come up here for

  he came up here growled wal-
ters because somebody chased him
here ill bet a weeks wages hes
one of them gangsters where did
he get that map of his somebody
slashed him and what did he carry
a gun for howd he learn to han-
dle it like that

  he probably double-crossed his
pals hes hiding out because this
is the last place anybodyd look for a
guy like him without his gun hes
a rat without his dope hell have a
yellow streak the whole width of his
back wait n see

  and walters proceeded to prove
his point in subsequent days he
tormented cyclops whenever he
could he never used physical vio-
lence but he taunted him and gave
him the hardest dirtiest jobs he

ridiculed him in front of the men
asked him if he left his nerve with
his gun

  it gets pretty cold in the adiron-
dacks in november and the fellow
was a pityful sight shivering around
in his city clothes he finally traded
a hundred dollars worth of wrist
watch for ten dollars worth of old
clothes but even these failed to rub
out the impression that he was a
dope addict and a coward without
his gun

  if it hadnt been for mrs carmody
i doubt if he could have stuck it
for a while under walterss spon-
sorship the fellows at his table saw
to it that cyclopss food was mostly
left-overs but when emma found
out about it she changed that

  i dont know whether it was be-
cause like all good cooks she
wanted to see every one eat and en-
joy her dishes whether it was a
natural sympathy for the under dog
or whether it was just pity anyway
she started to bring in his plate from
the kitchen and it was loaded down
with the best of everything all that
didnt make it any easier for cyclops
with the men especially walters
but it helped him carry on

 the carmodys had a daughter
jean about twelve she was and one
of those pretty kids who are full of
life and laughter she had the run
of the whole camp including the of-
fice and cyclops to show his appre-
ciation for what emma did for him
began to buy little things for jean

  there was some candy or a toy for
her every pay day to me it would
have been a hopeless procedure be-
cause the girl was plainly afraid of
him frightened by that face but
cyclops if he was aware of this per-
sisted as though it was the one way
to show his gratitude hed give his
presents to emma and tell her they
were for jean
cyclops



  we had a heavy snowfall a couple
weeks after cyclops arrived and he
was still working in his patent-
leather shoes they never got a
chance to dry out and he developed
a mean cough

  why dont you buy some decent
boots i asked him one night

  havent got the price

  that didnt sound right he was
making about fifteen a week he
had to pay seven dollars for his
board and a dollar for his room
that left him seven dollars and i
told him so

  i have to send five dollars a week
away he said

  what the hell for i asked but
he didnt answer

  he had two dollars and i lent him
three to get boots it wasnt be-
cause i liked him ill admit it but
i knew hed never last the winter
without them and i knew id get
my money back

if it hadnt been for walters i
think the men would have let
cyclops alone but in a camp
like ours its a case of follow the
leader and walters egged them on
he enlisted the aid of stumpy
bates who was a little squirt and
dumb but he suffered from a case
of hero worship

  you cant smoke on the job in most
lumber mills and so the fellows
chewed-tobacco or snuff with the
ranks about evenly divided cy-
clops in spite of the razzing kept
to his city habit of gum chewing

  one day he was in by the sorting
table-an endless moving platform
where the boards are taken off and
placed on the proper trucks for
stacking out in the yard-and
stumpy walked up to him

  ever try any snuff he asked

  no said cyclops i never have

  how about trying some

  no thanks i dont believe i
want any

  well i think you do stumpy
grabbed cyclops around the waist
two other fellows got wise because
theyd tried the same thing on some
college fellows who were in camp
that summer they picked up cy-
clops and laid him on one of the
trucks

 they held him while stumpy
crammed snuff in both upper and
lower lips cyclops struggled for a
moment then just lay there they
held him for three or four minutes
until he could get the feel of the
snuff then let him up cyclops spat
out as much of the stuff as he could
and went quietly back to work

  right after that he tried to get a
job in the woods in one of the log-
ging camps but that work called
for skilled woodsmen and of course
he had no chance but somehow it
got out that he wanted to get away
that gave the men another chance to
razz him

  one sunday walters and i went
out with our shotguns for some rab-
bits we didnt see one until we
were nearly back to camp then a
big fellow jumped out of a snow-
covered brush pile about fifty feet
in front of us neither of us was
ready but walters got his gun up
and cut loose

  it was a tough shot and he missed
he cursed and stood staring after
the disappearing rabbit then we
heard another shot it wasnt the
crashing roar of a shotgun it was
more like the staccato bark of a rifle
walters looked at me and his red
face twisted into a puzzled scowl

  what the hell was that he
grunted and started off in the direc-
tion of the shot

  we found cyclops holding the
rabbit by his ears and looking him
over in his hands his automatic

hung loosely he looked up saw us
and waited for us to come up to him

  pretty handy with that pistol
eh leered walters

  not so very said cyclops he
turned his head so he could give
walters full benefit of that one eye
and his mouth curled in what might
have been either a smile or a sneer
he was pretty close

  i didnt say anything but i knew
it took skill to make a shot like that
with a side gun but walters was
sore thats my rabbit he
growled i shot it first if he had
not been wounded youd never been
able to hit it

  cyclops looked at walters for a
moment and didnt say anything he
held the rabbit up looked him over
theres only one mark on him he
said slowly and thats mine

  i noticed his voice sounded differ-
ent-something like it had that first
night walters must have noticed it
too he looked at cyclops then
down at the automatic the gun was
loosely held but the muzzle had
shifted slightly-toward walters

  im not sure but i think bucks
face stiffened he made some noises
in his throat turned and stalked off

  before i had a chance to follow
him cyclops spoke to me and again
his voice had changed this is for
mrs carmody-and the little girl
he said

  walters elaborated on the tale that
evening so that it sounded as though
cyclops had pulled a gun on him
the men were sore which may have
accounted for what happened the
following day

the mill yards at black lake
are like a miniature railroad
terminal except that the
tracks are built up in the air on what
are called docks two narrow-gauge
tracks lead from the sorting shed

and then branch off on about forty
sidings so that the lumber piles
spread over a wide area

  the height of the docks vary from
about eight to fifteen feet depending
on the contour of the ground and
to the careless worker they are a con-
stant menace a dozen or more men
fall off every year those who are
lucky enough to land on their feet
often get off with a shaking some-
times they break a leg those who
do not land on their feet are gen-
erally hospital cases

  stumpy bates and cyclops were
pushing a loaded truck that after-
noon and cyclops was walking be-
side it that was his own fault be-
cause the docks are narrow and the
only safe place to walk is behind or
in front from hints that were
dropped later on it appeared that
stumpy slid a ten-foot plank off
sidewise it caught cyclops on the
hip

  fortunately he knew from the mo-
ment it struck him he was going so
he jumped he struck on his feet
then went over on his face he was
lying there in the snow his hands
tucked in his groin his knees drawn
up when walters and i arrived

 come on snapped walters
get up you aint hurt

  i climbed down beside cyclops
he was on his feet then and i asked
him if he was all right he said
yes but pain kept him hunched
over and he hobbled off

  dock him for the afternoon
said walters and went back to work

jt n the spring the pressure on cy-
i clops eased up by that time
-a- no one paid any attention to
him because he kept to himself
because he made no attempt to stand
up for his rights except when he had
a gun he was branded yellow and
ignored

com-a
cyclops



  i dont think he had a friend in
camp i was still his roommate
but he never spoke to me unless
spoken to and after a bit i didnt
try to press him

  he did gain a little ground with
emma and jean carmody however
emma would always give him a
smile and jean got so she would
speak to him and accept his little
gifts personally i know that
pleased him because once or twice i
caught him humming to himself

  then along in may i saw the
other side of cyclops i found him
sitting on his bed one evening with
a picture in his hand and im sure
there was a sparkle in that eye of
his that time he showed me the
picture it was of a slim dark-
haired attractive girl of about nine-
teen or twenty and when he spoke
he was like a different person

  thats my sister he said then
ill be leaving next month i did
not say anything and he continued
shes been studying to be a teacher
and she graduates next month shes
already got a job lined up and were
going to be together i havent seen
her in three years

 of course i knew then why he
had come to black lake so thats
where you were sending the five
bucks each week he nodded and
i said the fellows around here
think youre a gangster the re-
mark sounded irrelevant as i heard
it but it wasnt not with what was in
my mind i was thinking of his sis-
ter

  you might call it that he said
simply

  and she doesnt know it

  no

  and thats why you wanted to
break the dope habit thats why you
came to a place like this without
any money

  he nodded again and went on talk-
  com-a

ing about his sister how their par-
ents were dead and how he had been
helping her through school finally
i asked him why hed been a gang-
ster and how he got the dope habit
but at that he shut up i wanted
to ask him if his sister knew about
his face but i didnt

  we had one train a day at black
lake-if you could call the engine
and one car which came through
from tupper lake junction a train
-and it was just wheezing up to the
shed that served as a station the
following friday when cyclops
came into the companys office

  buck walters and i were going
over the time cards getting them
ready for the clerk who made out
the pay roll fred stevens the
superintendent was talking with the
bookkeeper and jean carmody was
sitting at one of the three desks
playing with a typewriter

  i didnt pay any attention to cy-
clops because walters and i were
pretty busy and in another minute
the paymaster came in he was lug-
ging the big canvas pouch in which
he carried the money and his 
slapped against his hip as he walked
he called a greeting to us moved
up to the safe and dropped the bag
beside it

  in the next instant i heard the
office door open then somebody
rapped all right you guys up with
em

  three men stood in the doorway
two of them were young and slen-
der the other was older a thickset
fellow with bushy brows all three
of them had guns i turned around
and started to lift my hands the
paymaster went for his gun the
thickset man fired the paymaster
coughed once and fell forward on
his face his gun skidded across the
floor to one side of the room

  i looked at the rest of the men
	street  smiths complete stories

in the room the clerk the book-
keeper stevens walters and myself
were all standing down at one end
of the office with our hands up
jean carmody seemingly glued to
the spot still sat at the desk her
eyes wide with fear cyclops had
his hands raised and stood nearest
the door

the office wasnt very large
thene was no chance to get
out and not much shelter i
guess we all knew after what hap-
pened to the paymaster what we
could expect if we started anything
and not one of us was armed

  all right you punks line up
the thickset man and one of the
youths moved toward us up there
along this wall he motioned us
to one side so that we were strung
out with cyclops on one end and me
on the other the thickset man was
still giving orders

  get that telephone lefty the
youth who had remained by the
door stepped forward he found the
lead wire of the telephone box and
ripped it out then he stood in the
center of the room covering us while
the other two went over to the safe
the thickset man looked down at
the paymaster the other fellow
picked up he pay-roll pouch

  then i saw the paymasters gun
on the floor it was about opposite
walters and not more than four feet
in front of him it was partly hid-
den from the gunmen by a desk and
for a second or two i considered the
possibility of trying to get it but
common sense told me the idea was
crazy walters might have had a
chance at it but for any of the rest
of us it would have been suicide

  we got a car outside the gun-
man snarled in short clipped sen-
tences but we aint kiddin our-
selves about the get-away we got

this phone maybe theres others in
camp we aint got time to find out
only two roads lead from this dump
and maybe you think youll head us
off well think again

  he stepped over to jean carmody
and took her by the arm whose
kid is this

  my foremans said stevens

  o k well take her along we
want about four hours start keep
this quiet until nine to-night and
well let the kid out where she can

get help try to stop us and-

  you cant get away with that
it was the first word cyclops had
spoken and his voice reminded me
of the first night i saw him

  thats what you think snarled
the man he stabbed his gun to-
ward the paymaster hes dead
aint he and we bumped him
didnt we its the chair if were
caught but they can only burn
you once punk think it over if
you want to see this kid alive keep
your mouths shut all of you

  the fellow jerked jean to her feet
and she screamed shut up he
snarled and shook her she screamed
again then he slapped her the
next thing i knew he grabbed her
to him and i heard some one say
drop it

there has never been any
doubt in my mind about cy-
clops he knew these men
were desperate knew they were
killers he was an experienced gun-
man himself and he must have
known what to expect certainly he
knew he had no chance of making
it before they started shooting

  he had reached the paymasters
gun and was bending over it by the
time i looked at him when he
straightened up they let him have
it there were three shots two from
one gun and one from another
cyclops



three times i saw cyclopss lean
body jerk as the slugs tore into him

  he fired twice so close together
the shots almost sounded as one
one youth dropped the pay-roll
pouch staggered and sat down sud-
denly he was conscious but he
uttered no sound he just sat there
with a dumb expression in his eyes
the other fellow dropped his gun
grabbed at his stomach he bent
over sort of curled up as he fell
then cyclops and the thickset man
faced each other

  i guess it was sheer will power
that kept cyclops on his feet he
looked like a whisky-paralyzed
drunk his knees had begun to sag
and one hand reached to the desk
top for support the thickset man
crouched behind jean carmody so
that only his head and his gun were
visible

  drop that gun he screamed
drop it or-

  cyclopss voice sounded tired but
there vas bitterness in every syl-
lable your numbers up jack
he said get out from behind the
girl and take it like a man

  the gunman waited-waited i
guess for cyclops to fold up under
the three slugs he carried then he
must have seen cyclopss trigger fin-
ger tense must have seen the deci-
sion in his one good eye even as i
sensed that he was going to shoot

  i thought jean was done for cy-
clops was weaving back and forth
on his feet he didnt seem to be
aiming the gun i started to yell
something-i dont know what be-
cause the words stuck in my throat

  they squeezed triggers together
the guns roared in unison cyclops
staggered slumped down on the
desk one hand dangling over the
side a tiny black spot appeared in
the middle of the thickset mans
forehead a black spot that was a

hole which widened as his eyes
glazed he rocked forward on his
toes then he and jean and the
gun flopped to the floor in a bloody
heap

 the clerk and the bookkeeper
eased cyclops from the desk to a
chair the desk top was bloody and
the front of his patched flannel
shirt was wet and red i caught a
glimpse of walters making for the
door stevens was kneeling beside
jean carmody cyclops took hold
of my hand

 my sister he  whispered
hoarsely take care of my things
-my insurance im countin on
you his eye was bright and im
sure the twitch of his lips before
he died was a smile

i wrote cyclopss sister that
night and from the assortment
of belongings in his one suit-
case i got the rest of his story it
was quite simple

  the croix de guerre and the dis-
tinguished service cross together
with three citations explained his
lacerated face he had been a ma-
chine gunner from bits of a
sketchy diary i learned of his al-
most constant hospitalization for
five years and the forming of the
dope habit

  from letters i found the story of
a sensitive man who because of his
deformity had avoided his friends
and eventually landed among the one
class who ask no questions-the un-
derworld his activities there had
paid for his sisters education

  i burned the diary and those let-
ters that i knew he would not want
her to know about

  when i went downstairs i learned
that walters had not shown up for
supper he left camp the next
morning without speaking to any
of us
 men of honor

by bob dusoe

a pin through a butterfly

ptaul bernard a shape-
less straw hat pulled down
over his eyes to protect
them from the glaring sun
sat motionless in a corner
of the courtyard awaiting his sum-
mons a guard stood near by in the
shade of a sentry box and the lazy
buzz of flies mingled with the mo-
notonous drone of voices that came
from the open windows at one end
of the courtroom

  the prison tribunal was in session
that day jean molin the turnkey
had been murdered and old pa-
pillon-the butterfly-was on trial

for his life bernard was there to
testify because he could truthfully
swear that he had seen papillon a
good half mile away on the other
side of st laurent at the time the
murder was supposed to have been
committed his testimony would
probably result in his own confine-
ment because he had had no right
to be where he was that day

  but what of that he knew too
well how easy it is for an innocent
man to be caught in a web of cir-
cumstances life is cheap in guiana
but if he could save old papillon
from the guillotine what did it mat-
men of honor



ter that he himself would suffer a
month or two in the cells

 a guard appeared in the doorway
and mopped the sweat from his long
swarthy face come on you he
ordered and jerked a thumb over
his shoulder theyre ready for
you

 bernard stood up and walked to
the door his step was slow and
his cheeks were colorless but his
eyes were still clear and there was
youth in his carriage guiana and
the prison had not yet robbed him
completely he removed the tat-
tered straw hat and followed the
guard on into the room

  the superintendent fidgeted with
boredom while the clerk made the
necessary notes in his records the
pen scratched and bernards indif-
ferent glance shifted from one to
the other of the prison officials in
their spotless white to rest finally
on the frail stooped figure of pa-
piilon

 twelve years the old man had
served at hard labor and eight in
exile four years more and his debt
to society would be paid in full
whatever his crime had been he
had paid for it dearly that there
had been a crime bernard did not
doubt in spite of his bald head
and his long gray beard there was
a crafty glint in papillons beady
black eyes that belied the reverence
implied by his age sufficiently
angered and reasonably sure of
escape he would probably not have
hesitated to slip a knife between the
ribs of any man there and with no
more remorse than he would have
felt in sticking a pin through one
of his butterflies

  you have volunteered the infor-
mation the superintendent ad-
dressed bernard that on the after-
noon of february the eighteenth
between the hours of two and three

thirty you saw and spoke with the
prisoner in the vicinity of wing
tais store is that correct

  it is

  you will tell us how you knew it
to be the exact hour you mention
and what you yourself were doing
in the vicinity of wing tais store
at this time

  i knew it was two oclock or a
very few minutes after bernard
replied because the two-oclock
drum had just sounded and we were
on the way to the mill when one of
the guards asked me to hurry over
to the chinamans store for a pack-
age of tobacco papillon was seated
on the ground near the store exam-
ining his butterflies when i arrived
and i stopped to talk with him
bernard did not say that he had
also carried a note to the half-caste
daughter of the chinaman for which
he had been instructed to wait for
a reply that was a matter which
had nothing to do with the case at
hand

f   he superintendent frowned
am i to understand that
you remained there then for
an hour and a half conversing with
the prisoner

  bernard shook his head no i
was not talking all that time i
looked at the butterflies asked him
where he caught them how much
he got for them and a few things
like that then went into the store
when i came out papillon was still
there but this time i stopped to talk
with a group of liberes who were
discussing the arrival of the next
boat when i left them i went
straight to the mill

  and you estimate that an hour
and a half had passed between the
time you left the prison and finally
arrived at the mill

  i had no idea i had been that


street  smiths complete stories

long monsieur but the guard de-
clared that it had taken me an hour
and a half and that next time he
would send some one else

  he will for the next two months
at least the director stated with
significance which of the guards
was it

  guy cordeau bernard replied
he would rather not have told but
the superintendent would have
found out easily enough had he re-
fused

  i see and you are positive that
you went straight to the store from
the prison

  oui monsieur

  you are also sure it was the pris-
oner-this man here-with whom
you talked

  positive monsieur

  that will do and since time
passes so quickly for you you will
go to the cells for sixty days and
do your loitering there

  bernard shrugged his muscular
shoulders he had expected that
he wondered if what he had said
would also make trouble for the
guard he hoped not cordeau was
a decent sort not like jean molin
whose death seemed to have pleased
more than it grieved

  bernard glanced at the prisoner
there was  faint grin on the wrin-
kled face of papillon and as their
eyes met the old man nodded ever
so slightly bernard understood
the old convict was trying to thank
him not that he expected to be
thanked he had done no more than
he would have expected any one else
to do for him only in his case the
man who might have helped had
failed him instead

  the guard seized bernard by the
arm and shoved him toward the
door it was a particularly vicious
shove and he turned to stare at the
man it was durand better known

as pelican because of his enor-
mous nose and long thin face and
bernard knew at once that he had
made an enemy whether his testi-
mony freed papillon or not durand
had been one of the very few
friends of the murdered molin and
it was he who had accused papillon
because of threats the old man had
made in the past

biernard served his sixty
days in the cells and went
back to the dormitory in the
main prison to resume his days at
labor there remained three hun-
dred and twenty of them yet to
serve and then he would begin his
four years in exile

  he had not been one of the many
who were forever attempting to
escape he had thought that all
out comparing the failures and the
inevitable punishment with the few
attempts that had been successful
and had decided that in his case it
was better to spend his time and
efforts in preserving his health and
sanity eight years was not long
compared to ten twenty and even
thirty that confronted some had
that been his lot he would have long
since staked everything on one des-
perate attempt

  however this had been his rea-
soning before he had incurred the
enmity of durand persecution at
the hands of pelican began the day
he returned to the prison and in a
week the confidence he had stub-
bornly maintained so long began to
waver it was the dry season the
humid tropic heat was stifling and
each days labor under the relentless
driving of durand brought him
nearer a state of collapse

  with proper food and sleep a
man young and strong like bernard
could have withstood the devouring
toil for many months but the
men of honor



watery soup the bread and the nig-
gardly portions of meat doled out
in the prison at st laurent is
barely enough to prevent starvation
there are a few tasks less strenuous
that go to the favored but it was
bernards misfortune to have been
assigned to the lumber yard on his
release from the cells and there
from morning until midday and
from midday until dark he strug-
gled and strained under the weight
of heavy timbers and boards until
his knees shook with fatigue

  to plead or protest would gain
him nothing to rebel might bring
anything from solitary confinement
to death it was impossible to stall
to steal a few minutes rest now and
then for the mean detesting glance
of durand was forever upon him

  at night with his stomach empty
and complaining too exhausted to
sleep bernard lay on his bed of
planks thinking pondering and
afraid not of the malice of
durand but of what he himself
might do when he could stand it no
longer and it was then that his
thoughts turned to escape he had
less than a year to serve had con-
ditions remained as they were the
time would have passed quickly but
now he knew he could not hope to
survive durand would see to that
his one hope was to escape and if
he waited long he would be too far
gone for even that

  bernard had often criticized the
others for their foolhardy breaks
their unpreparedness but now that
he had decided to make the attempt
himself he found that he was even
less prepared than most of the
others had been he had no plan
whatever he had no money for
food and he had no weapon yet
he knew that at the first opportunity
he must lose himself in the
treacherous jungle

the opportunity came a few
days later and bernard made
the break without hesitation
the convicts from the lumber yard
were sent to help with the beaching
of logs at the river and while
durand talked with one of the other
guards bernard slipped away
through the tangle of brush and
vines along the bank

  ducking and dodging along the
narrow path he ran steadily until
lack of breath forced him to stop
if durand did not notice his absence
at once he would be sure to miss
him at the ten-oclock drum for a
few francs he could have hired some
bush negro to paddle him across the
maroni but he lacked the money to
buy even that small advantage
when he had regained his breath he
hurried on keeping to the path by
the river mindful only of the dis-
tance he put behind him

  toward the late afternoon his
thoughts turned to food and his
feverish haste gave way to a more
normal stride he must find a place
to sleep too if he were to stretch
out there on the ground a thousand
insects would devour him alive
there were berries and nuts in
great plenty if he only knew which
of them were edible he did not
want to run the risk of poisoning
himself so soon later on it might
not make so much difference

  bernard had hoped to find a na-
tive camp or at least a rubber
bleeder from whom he could beg
sufficient food to carry on but all
that day he saw not a single human
being when the shadows began to
lengthen he drank deep from the
river and climbed to the wide-
spread branches of a tree he made
a sling between two limbs with the
aid of vines and branches and there
he spent the night monkeys came
to chatter and protest and later the


street  smiths complete stories

night birds made the jungle hideous
with their cries but bernard slept
through it all numb with exhaus-
tion

 when morning came he went
back to the river to drink again and
bathe then continued on his way
his ears alert to every sound
caught the distant drone of voices
toward midday and peering out on
the river he saw a dugout laden with
a family of indians drifting down
the current he called to them
pointed frantically to his mouth
then his stomach but the indians
only stared with indifference while
the river carried them on their way
a fugitive convict meant nothing to
the indians and bernard in his
ragged prison garb with a number
stenciled across the front of his
blouse was conspicuously labeled

  angry and disappointed with
doubt gnawing now at his fevered
brain he stumbled on along the
path he saw no other signs of
habitation either on the river or in
the jungle and that night he
climbed again to the protecting
limbs of a tree it was his second
day without food and the next
would be his last if he continued to
starve himself his only alternative
was to fill his stomach with the wild
things that grew alongside the trail
and trust to heaven that they would
not throw him into immediate con-
vulsions

  morning came and once more he
drank his fill at the river water
however no longer appeased the de-
mands of his empty stomach he
was weak he must eat or he could
not go on a bush laden with in-
viting black and red berries grew
near by and he picked one of each
to taste them

  eat only the black ones a voice
spoke at his elbow the red are
not ripe and their juice is bitter

  bernard straightened with a gasp
papillon

 the old man chuckled to be
sure and what is so amazing about
that

  i guess it was the start you gave
me bernard replied i was about
convinced that there was not a liv-
ing soul in this whole cursed jungle
and you-well the last i saw of
you your head was bowed to the
crimson widow

 you had not heard that they
turned me loose

  no you remember i went from
the courtroom straight to the cells
yes yes i remember i owe you
much mon ami you fell in with
my scheme exactly as i had
planned

 your scheme what do you
mean

  even you did not guess eh
papillon grinned with delight i
must tell you but not now you
are in need of food we will go to
my camp where it is safe where
you can rest and we will talk there

deep in the jungle papillon
approached the bank of a
small stream and parting a
clump of undergrowth he bowed
bernard into a small well-kept
clearing high and above them
slung between two giant trees was
a platform where the old man netted
certain species of those gorgeous
butterflies that he sold to the broker
in st laurent

  it is not much of a camp pa-
pillon apologized but at least it is
better than the cells and here is
food eat but do not make your-
self ill

  with a dried fish in one hand and
a cake of cassava in the other ber-
nard sat with his back to a tree and
ate

  papillon shook his head and
men of honor



you left st laurent without a bit of
food-without even a knife sacre
it is a good thing that i followed
your trail what brought you to
guiana in the first place you do
not look like a frenchman you do
not talk like one

  and i am not one bernard de-
clared i am an american so un-
fortunate as to have been born in
paris and i am here in guiana be-
cause it was my further misfortune
to have been a guest of the nephew
of the count de montvere the night
the old reprobate was murdered and
robbed

  you should have had an alibi
mon ami always be sure of an
alibi

  the nephew should have been my
alibi mon ancien but he himself
was guilty and he was too low-prin-
cipled to tell the truth

 you do not seem as bitter
against him as some would have
been tell me why did you attempt
an escape so unprepared

  i had no other choice i thought
it better to die in the attempt than
to give that cursed durand the satis-
faction of sweating the life out of
me there in prison

  sacre you speak of the pelican
the old mans sharp little eyes
gleamed with hate it was like him
to take his revenge on you when he
could not reach me in a way his
cowardice is similar to that of the
nephew of whom you speak

  bernard shook his head i do
not understand

  because like the nephew he was
guilty too declared papillon to
save his own filthy hide he would
not tell the truth with the excep-
tion of myself he was the only man
in st laurent who knew that molin
left his post that day before he
should have and yet he was afraid
to speak

  you mean that molin left the
prison the day he was murdered be-
fore the regular change of guard
exactly it was a trick the two
of them played that first one and
then the other might visit with the
foolish wife of the doctor while the
old gentleman was still on duty in
the prison

  then-then it was possible for
you to have killed him after all
possible i did kill him i
waited behind that screen of vines
inside his gate and at exactly fifteen
minutes after one oclock i slipped
that knife with which you just
carved that cake between his foul
ribs

  bernard glanced uneasily at the
knife in his hand and put it aside

  i went then to the chinamans
store papillon continued and
when you came to deliver the note
to wing tais daughter i called you
to admire my days catch

you knew that i carried a note
to be sure was i not seated
with my back to that thin-board
partition-where i have sat many
times before

 you were bernard agreed
but tell me how were you so sure
i would speak for you

the old man smiled i was
sure because had you not
volunteered i would have
named you anyway

  and why did you kill molin
because he was a swine as you
well know and because i owe the
doctor my life

  but that is the business of a doc-
tor-the saving of life

  not in guiana it is anywhere
else but here it is much more sim-
ple to let the patient die

  does the doctor know what you
did for him

 dont be a fool you cannot

speak to a man regarding a flirtation
of his wife

  but there is still durand i can-
not see that you have helped the
doctor a great deal

 papillon rubbed his withered
hands and chuckled my task is
not yet finished and now there is
also durands injustice to you that
must be accounted for too

 bernard shook his head you
need not flirt with the guillotine on
my account mon ancien give me a
little food and show me the way out
of this cursed jungle that is all
i ask

  the way out zut that is noth-
ing the perfect escape i have
bad it for years any time i wish
to go i have but to leave and thumb
my nose at all the guards in
guiana

  then why are you still here
why my good friend where
else in the world are there as many
beautiful and valuable butterflies as
right here in this jungle sacre in
eight years here on the maroni i
have captured and classified close to
a thousand species think of it-a
thousand

  bernard glanced at papillon and
shrugged the old man seemed to
have suddenly gone a little mad

 but you are right papillon
spoke more calmly i am getting
old it is time i was leaving this
gutter of hell we will go together
i will make one more trip to st
laurent to attend to that dog
durand and prepare the way for the
two of us

  why not let well enough alone
bernard tried to reason your
luck might not hold next time if
you have made plans for your own
escape why will they not suffice for
two

  zut do you think it is my plan
to sneak off through the jungle like

those other fools or put to sea in
a dugout to drown in the mud at
nickery no not me wait and
you will see to-morrow i will
leave for st laurent in ten days

i	will return you will be safe here
there is plenty of food rest eat
and thank heaven that there are still
men of honor in this world like old
papillon

bernard counted the days
each morning he notched the
trunk of a tree at the edge of
the little clearing to be sure he would
not lose track on the morning of
the tenth day he carefully packed
the remaining food and few articles
that he thought they might need in
the anticipation of a hasty depar-
ture

  a twig snapped then the brush
parted and papillon staggered into
the clearing he did not speak for a
moment his breath came in short
gasps and there was an ugly dark
blotch on one side of his blouse

 you-you are wounded ex-
claimed bernard what has hap-
pened

  the old man eased himself to the
ground and rested his back against
the trunk of a tree the dog
the swine he cursed he was
smarter than i thought

  you mean durand did he do
that

  yes durand but it was my
own fault i was too confident i
thought he was dead he pulled his
gun and-and fired you must
make all haste they heard the shot
-and followed me

  bernard caught his breath they
followed you the guards

  yes i doubt if they will come
to-night it will soon be dark but
they were not far behind they will
pick up the trail again-at day-
light
men of honor



  you are right bernard agreed
we must make haste

  not we-you papillon declared
in that hollow tree you will find a
bundle hanging by a cord go get
it

 but what of you do you ex-
pect me to leave you here to be
dragged back to st laurent and the
guillotine

 the guillotine sacre the
widow will not get my head i have
a hole in my side you could stick
your fist in do as i say make
haste get that bundle

 bernard brought the bundle from
the hollow tree and dropped it at
the old mans feet

  papillon took a small packet from
beneath his blouse and held it out
with a shaking hand these are
your papers dont lose them you
are gaston leguay do not forget
leguay you mean leguay the
guard have you killed him too
no no fool leguay is on leave
that bundle contains a uniform-
shoes a razor everything-every-
thing you will need to make a guard
of you in this envelope with the
papers you will find eight hundred
francs eight hundred francs-un-
derstand it took me eight years
to steal and save it but that does
not matter now

 eight hundred francs gasped
bernard man you are mad with
that much money we could buy our
way out of guiana with ease come
we will cross the river to the dutch
side and i will find a doctor to at-
tend to your wound

 sacre will you do as i say-
and not argue i am old-rotten
with fever what is there in the
world for any man who has spent
twenty years in guiana now lis-
ten follow this stream to the
river you will find a dugout there
in the brush cross to the dutch

side and paddle with the current un-
til you come to albina put on the
uniform and hide those rags you
have on when you have shaved-
all but the mustache walk into town
and rent a room at the best hotel
but these papers suppose i am
asked to show them

  if you are clever it will not be
necessary but if you must-they
will pass i once forged my own
parole from the prison at st mar-
tin the photograph is old and
worn you will have a mustache and
leguay did not tell thm you just
grew it-that will explain the dif-
ference sign his name to the pa-
pers in your own hand-that is all
the rest is up to you

bernard placed the packet of
papers in his pocket and
picked up the bundle but he
still hesitated the clever plans
the years of toil and saving and all
the careful preparations of papillon
were his and the cost had been but
sixty days in the cells

  a little water before you go
mon ami and a cigarette

  here you are mon ancien ber-
nard spoke and stuck a cigarette be-
tween the old fellows lips he
struck a light then and held it to
the cigarette the light went out
and he struck another try again

he said you are not-

  bernard dropped the match and
backed away papillon was dead
slowly he picked up the bundle
again and went down to the little
stream an hour later where the
stream joined the dark silent river
he found a dugout hidden in a
clump of brush and taking the pad-
dle he sent the blunt bow out into
the current in the morning he
would be on the dutch side in the
little town of albina the rest
would be up to him

signature of englands beloved
queen victoria those who
think that sex can be told by hand-
writing will see in this signature a
good reason why writing cannot be
differentiated as masculine or femi-
nine with positive assurance could
anything be bolder and more coura-
geous than this signature and
this was written by a queen who
ruled at a time when ladies were
supposed to faint on the slightest
pretext and were kept closely
guarded in the home

  but no man could write a more
masculine-looking signature - peo-
ple are still prone to call a script

masculine that is heavy and boldly
stroked that theory does not hold
to tell the truth i receive more in-
dividual bold scripts penned by
women than i do by men

and temper in the heavily dotted is
and strongly stroked t the letters
are both angular and rounded

  your uneven angular script shows
a scientific bent and yet you have
not exactly the sense of form for
engineering though you might de-
velop this you have imagination
and that particular type of energy
and variety of interests which fit
in well with newspaper work your
analytical qualities could be used
here just as much as in the other
work so my advice is to study jour-
nalism in your case i suggest that
you get a small newspaper job while
studying because you will learn
better through practical experience
than through a scholarly course

 j h west va perhaps you
will notice that you have somewhat
the same style of writing as the
young man from hawaii so jour-
nalism would be most suitable for
you too however because you are
a girl it might not be easy for you
to break into newspaper work as
you like children and have thought
of teaching them i suggest that you
try writing stories for them and
take some training which will assist
you to illustrate these stories in
that way you will be able to com-

fiction fashions

whenever two or
three writers get to-
gether for a social
chat whether by pre-
arrangement or a happy
coincidence-fate always waves the
banner of a felicitous coincidence in
the eye of an author-eventually the
talk turns to the taste of the reading
public when a tired editor has
spent the best part of several months
trying to discover definite signs on
the literary horizon that a certain
type of fiction has established its
popularity with the reading public
and he has come to the sad conclu-
sion that there is no fixed fashion in

fiction along comes one of these wise
writers to tell him what the reading
public wants now

  if an editor presses one of these
writers for more definite data on why
adventure stories are out and de-
tective stories are in the writer
fails to present any new or clinching
evidence for his statement at best
he will insist-naming four or five
new fly-by-night out-of-the-alley
sensational rags-such and such
magazines are going strong while
the general adventure magazines
naming a bunch of ephemeral
pseudo-adventure magazines are
not going

here is one editor who
does not hesitate to dismiss
all such loose talk about
present taste in popular fiction as
silly who discounts the heated con-
clusions of these informal confer-
ences of writers as of no conse-
quence any real editor is keen to
get the opinions of writers and to
discuss the perennial subject of fic-
tion with them but no real editor is
misled or overborne by the passing
opinions of writers his position is
not so much that he knows more
about public taste than the writer
but that his position is fixed by cer-
tain stable elements in human nature
he the editor may have as many
lapses in taste or judgment as the
writer nor does he contend that he
is immune to criticism-in fact he
invites the criticism of his readers
if he is a good editor rather than the
opinions of his writers-but he
knows fashions in fiction may come
and go the style of writing may
change from generation to genera-
tion and popularity is apt to be as
ephemeral as the weather but a
good stout story is never out of fash-
ion no matter to what particular
type of adventure crime or mys-
tery it may belong the story is
the thing if there is a real story
a coming  together of men and
wdmen in human conflict with a re-
leasing of the emotions of human
nature that story will always regis-
ter with discriminating readers so
long as men are men

you may and undoubtedly do
read a number of clever fic-
tion pieces-stories which
hold your passing interest because
of some clever trick ending of the
writer but such stories will remain
in your mind no longer than the to-
bacco in your pipe while a story
with little plot and no tricks but

with real feeling and sincerity be-
cause it betrays a dramatic or tragic
crisis in the life of a fellow human
wayfarer will remain a permanent
possession of your mind your edi-
tor recalls with unabated emotion
one of the boys stories he read twen-
ty-five years ago it was the story
of a boy who joined a circus and left
it with a little monkey as his pet
it was written by a man who held a
respectable position in the consular
service of the united states he
liked boys and he loved animals he
spent his working day looking after
the concerns of his country not at
an informal conference table talking
big about the trend in fiction or what
will go with readers and editors

  he was not concerned to write a
story to order he was deeply
stirred by the plight of youth in a
hard situation and the compensation
the boy found for his loneliness in
the companionship of an unhappy
little monkey there was nothing
sensational in the situation no mur-
der mystery or rackets but a
tough-minded man who has read and
digested thousands of books in the
meantime who has known life at
many levels still recalls that story
with a lump in his throat

this is the test-the only test
of popularity and the only
gauge to apply to a story
does it leave you feeling differently
about life and people does the
story restore your belief in the in-
herent decency of human nature and
the worth of human life if it does
its a good story if it leaves you
with a feeling of disgust for your
kind a disbelief in any good but
pleasure and profit take my word
for it it is a piece of cheese even
if it moves with the rapidity of an
airplane and is filled with brawling
and undefeated dare-devils
