just a word or two about serials in weird tales this magazine does
not overload its pages with serials because our readers like to be able
to finish a story without waiting for future issues to appear on the
news stands however some of our most thrilling stories have been serials
and we feel that it would be unfair to our readers to deny them the pleasure
of reading a fine weird story merely because it is too long to print complete
in a single issue

    ray cummings has written an amazing sequel to explorers into infinity
a startling weird-scientific story called the giant world it would not be
possible to print it complete in one issue without crowding out several very
fine stories by other authors but pur readers we feel should be given the
best weird stories obtainable and we do not want to deprive them of the
inestimable privilege of accompanying martt and frannie to that giant
world with its eery monstrosities its blood-freezing horrors and its weird
beings that dwindle out of largeness unfathomable so we shall print it as
a three-part serial this magazine has refused to make any hard and fast
rule which would bar out stories merely because they are too long to be
printed complete in a single issue however we print only one serial at a
time in order to have as large an assortment of thrilling short-stories and
complete novelettes in each issue as possible the current serial the
time-eaider began in the october issue we are holding off the first install-
ment of the giant world until next months issue when the time-raider
will end for by running only one serial at a time we are able to give you a
large number of complete weird stories in each issue instead of filling up
our pages with continued stories

    from time to time in the editors mail there have eome requests that we
publish fact articles about the werewolves and vampires and other legendary
weird beings that appear in our stories as weird tales is a fiction maga-
zine we have been averse to printing articles of any sort preferring to use
the space for thrilling weird stories but we have found a way to place

weird tales

continued from page 

these weird beliefs of our ancestors before you without cutting down the
number of stories by printing short articles of only a page or even less in
length alvin f harlow is the author of this series of very short articles
which he has called folks used to believe in the space of a page or less
in each issue he will describe such legendary weird creatures as the vampire
and werewolf lilith first wife of adam the salamander which can sit in a
hot fire without being burned the basilisk with its deadly poisonous gaze
the phoenix rising miraculously from its ashes the barnacle goose the uni-
corn the cockatrice and many other strange beings in which our ancestors
believed

     lovecrafts story in the october issue pickmans model breathes the
eeriest most paralyzing and yet most realistic atmosphere of horror i have
encountered anywhere fiction or fact writes jack snow of dayton ohio
most weird tales are fantasies pure and simple told in a manner that is
momentarily convincing but lovecrafts tales make you halt in the middle
of a downtown business street and remark uneasily to yourself why that
might happen lovecraft is the realist of weird fiction

    max f mvers of lewistown pennsylvania writes to the eyrie mr
lovecraft deserves pagans of praise for his latest pickmans model it is my
estimation of a weird tale in every sense of the word i believe that his tech-
nique is unparalleled by any of the authors who contribute to your magazine
my apologies to mr quinn absence makes the heart grow fonder
perhaps that is why i went into ecstasies of joy and whooped with delight
when i found lovecrafts name on a story in the october issue  

    such enthusiastic letters encourage us to give you the heartening news
that lovecrafts greatest story the call of cthulhu will shortly be pub-
lished in weird tales we are fully aware that in calling this story love-
crafts finest we are setting a high mark for the tale to live up to
for he has written such masterpieces as the outsider the festival and the
rats in the walls but we feel that the vaulting imagination the author dis-
plays in this story his supreme artistry and the uncanny hold that the tale
takes on the reader make the call of cthulhu one of the greatest and most
powerful works of weird fiction ever written

    writes iris lora thorpe of portland oregon the poem lake deso-
lation by leavenworth maenab in the august issue of weird tales was
wonderful and i shall never forget the story the city of glass as the
secretary of the northwest poetry society i read a very great deal of
poetry and in weird tales i find some very fine work

    e mengshoel of minneapolis writes to the eyrie i have bought
and read every issue of weird tales for the last two years and i am going
to keep on reading that different magazine its unique literature affords

beneath the skies of saturn pale and many-mooned

her palace is

her wyvem-warded spires of sinoper enruned
with names benign and mightier names of malefice

illume with fulgent phares	

a marish by the black lethargic seas lagooned

her molure-holden stairs

go down in coiling jet and gold on some unplumbed abyss

long as a leaping flame superb magnifical

across the sun

her banners bear aidennic blooms armorial
and beasts infernal on a field of ciclaton

amid her agate courts

like to a demon ichor towering proud and tall

a scarlet fountain spurts

to fall upon parterres of dwale and deathly hebenon

from out her amber windows gazing languidly
on a weird land

where conium and cannabis and upas-tree
seem wrought in verdigris against the copper sand

she sees and sees again

a trailing salt like leprous dragons from the sea
far-crawled upon the fen

and foam of monster-cloven gulfs beyond a fallow strand

or looking from her turrets to the south and north

she notes the gleam

of molied mountains and of rivers pouring forth

clear as the dawn to fail in fulvous rill and stream
the widening waste amid

or swell the fallen meres abominable swarth

in green mirages hid

to be the unquested grails of hell of death and deathful
dream

 suddenly the boss turned to me and queried
 weil conroy whats your opinion they all
 listened politely for me to speak and in the silence x
 hoard my thin wavering voice stammering and sput-

weird tales

counted domes and pinnacles of
prodigious atlanaat we have seen
the incredible bulk of angkor tower-
ing above the jungles of siam with-
in the red walls of holy marrakesh
wo have been the friends of princes
and in khotan the khan esteems us
and what do we seek

  who knows what we seek saidif
in the tombs of the kings of pegu
we found cool unblinking sapphires
and great rubies that smoldered like
the embers of a plundered city and
in far-off java in mysterious bora-
bador we found gold that ancient
smiths had tormented into odd shapes
for the pleasure of forgotten princes
lost and obscure lands have disgorged
treasures to us who knew not what
we sought and cared not for what
we found

  and where are we going haaji
where the will of allah leads us
in search of we know not what and
who am i to know more concluded
the old man with finality as one com-
ing to the end of a lesson well recited

  in search of i know not what to
be found i know not where mur-
mured landon to himself

  saidi began the pilgrim there
is something which you seek can
you not trust your servant have i
not served you well

  well and faithfully ismeddin
replied landon what do i seek
what does anyone seek who wanders
over the earth

  but you have nothing to seek mas-
ter you are wealthy beyond reckon-
ing you have seen war and adven-
ture  in herat you have a palace and
the daughter of an emir and the
princes of asia are your friends from
holy marrakesh to turkestan tell
me saidi persisted the old man

  very well then ismeddin i am
on the trail of a phantom a vision
a legend an apparition whose traces
i have found everywhere whose pres-
ence i have found nowhere and

what i have in herat of the hundred
gardens is not enough for me to say
more would be madness now bring
me my journal haaji and then in-
spect the sentries remember a hun-
dred lashes for any who sleep on post
tonight  

  when ismeddin left landon de-
voted himself to his journal writing
of mosul and the mound of koyun-
jik in whose base were the ruins of
palaces and the monstrous effigies of
winged bulls whose human heads wore
long curled beards and were crowned
with tall miters solemn awful im-
ages which archeologists had not been
able to induce their laborers to dis-
turb and he regarded with curiosity
the clay tablets he had found in the
rubbish of the excavations that after-
noon tablets of sun-dried clay in-
scribed with cuneiform characters and
stamped with seals among whose de-
vices he recognized the tree of life
but he could not name the king
who knelt and worshiped a woman
mounted on a lion

  three clay tablets all that re-
mained of lofty walls and great pal-
aces and high towers three clay tab-
lets and the solemn winged bulls

  it was most unlikely that anyone
could have passed the outposts and
the encampment as well and yet
landon sensed a presence he
glanced over his shoulder moved
away from the wall of the pavilion
resumed the writing of his journal
arose from his work made a circuit
of the pavilion re-entered and re-
turned to his task

  the thump-thump of an atabal
rolled up from the encampment and
then came a monotonous guttural
chant and the beating of hands and
the stamping of feet in unison his
men were diverting themselves with
unsavory songs to whose cadence one
of their number burlesqued the steps
of a cairene dancing girl

  presence indeed what if ismed-
din had seen the master glancing
the infidels daughter



over his shoulder and fidgeting in that
fashion

  landon felt his toes twitching
nervously found himself clenching
and then relaxing his fists and paus-
ing to twist his mustache instead of
writing his journal it seemed that
ismeddin had been gone longer than
usual he wondered why his men
never changed the tune of their chant
at evening

  a faint breath of sweetness crept
into the pavilion scarcely percep-
tible at first but gradually becoming
more penetrating mingling with the
aroma of landons cigarette so that
he fancied it might be the source of
that insinuating perfume but it
couldnt be those cigarettes had
been made to his order and ran true 
to form and even one had it been
scented would have betrayed its
presence ere this he ground the
half-burned cigarette into the earth
just beyond the fringe of the rug that
covered the pavilions floor and
fumbled for an unpolluted smoke
and then with a start he dropped
his case

a slim girl stood in the entrance
regarding him with long-lashed
smoldering eyes silver-white she
gleamed through the smokelike wisps
of gauze that clothed her shapely
form yet before all this loveliness
landon shivered

  i have sought you from afar
saidi she purred softly matching
with her voice the sweetness that had
heralded her arrival and finally i
have found you here of all places
encamped on the ruins of that note-
worthy house of mine which once
stood on this very spot

  as she advanced to the center of the
pavilion she adjusted the extraordi-
nary diadem that adorned the abys-
mal darkness of her hair landon mar-
veled at the sinuous grace of her arms
and slim fingers and the undulating

rippling glide of her walk and he
wondered that he had shuddered as
he first met her veiled babylonic eyes

  she paused in her advance halting
at the center of the pavilion

 noteworthy house hazarded
landon vacantly

  yes it has been in ruins for
some time  oh ever so long a time
you know my friend naram-sin
built it for me and when he
died 

  her voice trailed into nothingness
her words were completed in an arch-
ing of her pointed brows and a
fleeting gesture of her tiny hand as
though no words were needed where
but one conclusion could be drawn

  landon was still wondering how
she had ever passed the sentries for
some reason it did not occur to him
to wonder how long a time must
elapse before one could pitch ones
camp on the site of a once noteworthy
house

  tell me lady and who are you to
be seeking me

  one thing at a time never mind
the discrepancy about naram-sin and
the noteworthy house and even one
thing at a time is too much

  the girl laughed and effortlessly
seated herself cross-legged on the
lustrous bijar rug at landons feet

  those of mosul who have seen me
dancing here in the moonlight call mo
bint el kafir which in a way is
right why not call me the infidels
daughter when since the death of
naram-sin i have lived in a villa on
the crest of djeb el kafir

  landons brain was slowing up
like run-down clockwork he blinked
passed his hand over his eyes stroked
his beard questions were fighting
for expression twice he half opened
his mouth to speak but said nothing
the girl disregarded his stupor
ignored his inertia and patted her
dusky coiffure

  yes she repeated i am the
infidels daughter and i have come


weird tales

to tell you    but what have you
been seeking all your life of wander-
ing saidi

  and landon as in a dream began
the ritual he had so often heard old
ismeddin repeat concluding with
and i am going where the will of
allah leads me in search of i know
not what

  the girl smiled as at a pupil who
has learned his lesson well

  say rather saidi if truth is any
consideration that you have heard
of a shrine on the topmost crest of
djeb el kafir in which hangs a small
drum and at the base of whose altar
are three clay tablets resembling those
which you picked up today

 landon momentarily recovered
from the numbness that weighted his
senses

  lady you know too much of djeb
el kafir and you wear a diadem

strangely like the one-

  why should i not know i live
there and have for a long time but
since you know so much saidi have
you the heart to learn all  come now
tell me the truth over all of asia
you have sought her who dances to
the evening star on the crest of the
mount of the infidel but could you
endure the hundred and one strange
kisses she bestows on those who sum-
mon her from across the border
could you saidi

landon leaped to his feet staring
who are you he demanded
grasping the girl by the wrist and
how do you know the thoughts i
hardly admitted to myself   

  my lord i am more than bint el
kafir i am sarpanit and in ar-
menia they have another name for me
but you are bruising me be seated
saidi and i will dance for you
whereat she drew from her curi-
ously embroidered girdle a small vial
whose stopper she removed the
heavy perfume that pervaded the
pavilion increased to an overpower-

ing deady sweetness with a drop
from the vial she anointed her eye-
brows and with her fingertips she
smeared a drop of that overwhelming
fragrance on landons eyelids and
on his black beard then pivoting
about on the tips of her toes she
spilled the remainder of the essence
in a circle about her snapped her
fingers thrice and began a dance of
statuesque formal steps and poses

  now if i only had music 

  from the encampment below there
came renewed the chanting of lan-
dons men and the pulsing of an ata-
bal but the rhythm was unlike any
that landon had ever heard his men
play a compelling hypnotic cadence
a throbbing sorcery that rippled up
and down his spine in waves of fire
and frost cutting into him like a
sword-thrust

   the girls tiny feet seemed to trace
 the figures of the bijar rug on which
 they stepped her body rippled and
 swayed and her silver-white limbs
 seemed jointless and serpentine

  landon noted that where she had
spilled that unearthly perfume there
was now a circle of small quivering
lapping flames vibrant incredible
flames bluer than the burning of sul-
fur

   she paused in her dance

   there are three tablets which you
will pry from the base of the altar
saidi and from the comer of one a
piece is broken so that no man can
read the inscription completely but
i will tell you the hidden name of the
infidels daughter the one secret
name of her many names so that you
can call her from across the border

   with her lips to his ear the girl
whispered a word and twice repeated
it

   	 do not forget saidi    and this
 one kiss this first shall lead you to
 seek the hundred that follow

  then as she resumed her dance
the girl chanted a song of unearthly
the infidels daughter



desires and tormenting delights of
the hundred and one kisses with
which sarpanit had caressed naram-
sin who had been a king in agadc
and who had ruled in babil landon
nodded to the cadence of the mutter-
ing drums dizzied by the flickering
swiftness of her feet   

a wisp of silk was vanishing
through the door of the pavilion
a low laugh rippled in from the dark-
ness the sweetness was vanishing
and the blue flames had died landon
started rubbed his eyes shivered
then he drew his pistol and with its
butt smote the small brazen gong at
his side paused and struck a second
and third time haaj ismeddin ap-
peared before its last vibration had
ceased

  what of the sentries haaji de-
manded landon ignoring the old
mans salaam

 on their posts saidi and
awake he added unnecessarily
surely for it was too early for sen-
tries to sleep on post

  together they inspected the sen-
tries much to the old mans amaze-
ment and more to his amazement
landon took an electric torch and
closely scrutinized the earth that
marked the -patrolled boundaries of
the encampment then returning to
his pavilion he repeated that same
close examination of the surrounding
earth

  ismeddin held his peace and re-
frained from inquiring what the mas-
ter had lost one can never tell just
what may be lost by one who wanders
too long in the desert and among
ruins so that it is not wise to ask
questions yet it seemed that the
master was looking for footprints
which he could not find

    the earth is very firm here and a
light tread might fail to leave an im-
print  he commented as he finally
entered the pavilion

  even so saidi

  and a stealthy agile person
might indeed have passed vigilant
sentries  

  even so saidi agreed ismeddin
landon smoked in silence until his
cigarette seared his fingertips

  where are we going haaji he
snapped

the old man stared perplexed for
that question was out of order the
ritual had already been complied
with but habit asserted itself
where the will of allah leads us

in search of we know not what-

  ah but now we do know haaji
interrupted landon listen to-
morrow we start northward into the
uttermost limits of kurdistan and
then still farther north to djeb el
kafir on whose crest there is a curi-
ous shrine-

  no master there we will not go
contradicted ismeddin

 what

  i have spoken we will not go
why not questioned landon
amazed at tho old mans contradic-
tion

  it is a place of evil saidi where
the infidels daughter dances to the
evening star

  what do you know of the infidels
daughter

    too much too much entirely so
that i do not care to learn more and
we will not go

  haaji snapped landon

  the old man glanced up and met
the relentless adamantine fire of lan-
dons unwavering stare quivered un-
der that pulsating merciless will con-
veyed by the masters predatory
eyes shivered    shrank    yielded

  we will go haaji came the
slow deliberate voice of the master

  even so saidi conceded the old
man admitting defeat

  yes i will go and you with me
for there will be words which i can


weird tales

not speak and scripts which i can
not read and calculations which i
can not make  and in all this you
shall serve me that is all haaji

  ismeddin bowed himself from the
masters presence once without the
pavilion and beyond the view of its
interior he halted lifted his eyes
searching for some constellation until
his gaze rested on a scintillant evilly
flaming ruddy star that dominated
the southeastern quarter of the
heavens

  playmate and brother of the in-
fidels daughter may allah drown
your fires in nethermost hell and
you infidels daughter by what
right do you walk the earth again
who called you from aralu

  then head bowed ismeddin sought
his quarters where he finally cursed
and muttered himself into a troubled
sleep

in the morning the caravan began
its march to the north of kurdi-
stan bound for the yuruk mountains
and beyond into that wild land of
uncertainty that lies south of trebi-
zond where strange gods make their
homes where anaitis is worshiped
with curious rites and where malik
taus spreads his painted fan where
djeb el kafir towers loftily to an evil
eminence crowned by the seldom-
sought shrine of the infidels daugh-
ter

  bint el kafir they called her in the
south on the plain of babil a flicker-
ing apparition that beguiled wander-
ers and dabbling necromancers who
sought to reach across the border
seduced them from their senses and
led them to their doom with her song
of the hundred and one strange
kisses and of the indescribable pleas-
ures and joyous torments she once
lavished on naram-sin of agade and
thinking on all this landons men no
longer sang to the beating of atabals
when they made camp of an evening

desertion thinned the ranks of the
caravan to a handful so that there
remained but the faithful few
headed by landon and the somber-
eyed haaj ismeddin to push on
through the passes of the yuruk
mountains bribed by the masters
gold and beaten by his fierce exul-
tant eye

  finally one evening after the tents
had been pitched ismeddin entered
the masters pavilion and announced
we are at the foot of djeb el kafir
just before us and high above is the
shrine of the infidels daughter be-
hind us is the source of the tigris
and close at hand is    our doom
saidi turn back

  landon in his exultation dispensed
with the remainder of the recital for
now that he knew what he sought the
overpowering madness of his knowl-
edge veiled the memory of his years
of wandering so that the uncounted
domes of prodigious atlanaat the in-
credible bulk of angkor and red
walls of holy marrakesh were as
nothing and less than nothing

  turn back saidi

  no ismeddin replied landon
gently as one who reproves an erring
child have we two ever before
turned back and the doom will be
mine will it not

  the next morning landon on foot
and attended only by ismeddin be-
gan the ascent of the final peak of
djeb el kafir all day long they
fought their way up the pathless
perilous sides of the mountain until
at last shortly before sunset they at-
tained their goal and halted before a
great conical mass of black rock that
rose out of the thin earth of the crest
of djeb el kafir in color and texture
and luster it was different from the
stones in the vicinity a black outlaw
among the gray natives

  	 the shrine saidi the house of
bint el kafir ages ago it fell from
the infidels daughter



heaven white lustrous dazzling but
the memory of her untold iniquities
blackens it

  a meteorite thought landon
recognizing the texture and dark
color

  as they approached they noted the
sculptures in low relief smooth pol-
ished by the winds of ages almost ob-
literated at the sight of them is-
meddin stroked his beard and mut-
tered  and landon wondered if after
all that conical rock might not be the
topmost pinnacle of the palace of
iblis reaching up and passing the
surface of the earth

  then rounding the circumference
of the rock they saw that the shel-
tered sides were more finely and
clearly sculptured the figures over
the low arched entrance were mi-
nutely detailed and the panels at
either side were as delicately carved
as a cleanly struck medal a woman
of incredible beauty was mounted on
a lion and received the adoration of
bearded kneeling kings and then
there were panels not as easily or
explicitly described tormented and
curiously interlaced figures depicting
things which even if allegorical were
grotesque and outlandish beyond all
imagining

  let us return saidi urged the
old man it is not good to look
upon such things and ismeddin
indicated the unholy sculptures that
flanked the doorway of that black
conical shrine that pointed upward
like a pudgy misshapen index finger

  but instead of replying landon
drew from his belt a flashlight and en-
tered the low archway shaking off the
restraining hand of ismeddin the
old darvish foot on the threshold
about to enter shrank back loyalty
to the master had its limits

  as ismeddin paced to and fro at
the entrance he noted the indirect
glow of the masters flashlight heard
the tinkle of tiny bells and the snap-

ping of exceedingly dry wood heard
landons footsteps as he prowled
about in that awful shrine became
aware of an overpowering deathly
sweetness as of all the sandalwood of
the indies and all the roses of
naisliapur blended into one com-
pelling fragrance the old man
shuddered and wondered what djinn
or afreet would materialize and drive
them both stark mad

  christ above skin and bones
came the wide-spaced accents of lan-
don from within and an instant la-
ter he stumbled out of the shrine
bearing in his hand three clay tablets
in the other he grasped a small ket-
tle-drum and a glittering object of
silver filigree and saw-piercing a
curiously wrought diadem

  ismeddin saw that the masters
dark bronze had paled to a sickly yel-
low that his hands trembled and
that his lips twitched not with ter-
ror but rather unbelief awe incre-
dulity beyond expression

  skin and bones ismeddin he
repeated speaking to himself rather
than to his companion a king ly-
ing on a lofty dais and on his fore-
head was the print of rouged lips on
his face the look of him who had lived
in an instant all the wonders and bliss
ever known in the whole mad life-
time of those who eat hasheesh   

  ismeddin followed the masters
footsteps down the pathless slope

  he seemed asleep  i shook
him by the shoulder    my hand
met not the substantial form of a
man but a hollow shell skin and
bones  as the shell of an insect
dried in the sun 

  you saw that master

  even so haaji and she herself
was there but i could not see her

  darkness had fallen ismeddin
and the master made camp

  saidi do you know what you
saw   


weird tales

  i do and vet i do not quite

  you saw one who sought the hun-
dred and first kiss and found
it then noting the plunder
what have you there

    three clay tablets which you must
teach me to read a drum with a head
of serpents hide which i must learn
to play and this diadem the like of
which i have seen only once before

  and where did you see it be-
fore  

   in my tent on the mound near
koyunjik where she danced before
me

 ah the old man understood
saidi break the tablets into small
pieces toss the drum into this fire
and drop the diadem into a deep
well  

  no haaji and to see that you
do not do that sleep while i stand
watch tonight

at nook the next day landon and
ismeddin rejoined the train at
the encampment at the foot of djeb
el kafir and then on the following
morning they started on the return
trip to the south toward the source of
the tigris and thence eastward with
syria as their ultimate destination
and in damascus the caravan dis-
banded leaving landon and ismed-
din in that ancient city to recuperate
from the long march

  since you insist i will read the
wedge-shaped characters on those ac-
cursed tablets ismeddin finally
agreed  it is the old forgotten lan-
guage of the hills older than that
spoken by the infidels who once ruled
on the plains of babil a different
language but written in the same let-
ters naram-sin of agade learned it
and summoned her from across the
border you saw what was left of
him you will surely follow for-
get it

  no ismeddin all these years of
adventure have brought me every-

thing but content so let me track
this madness to its finish i will call
her from across the border spell
me the first line

  saidi began the old man many
days later when the tablets had final-
ly been transcribed many years
have passed since these words were
written in the days of naram-sin the
proper place from which to call her
was near mosul and to this day there
are legends of the great tower that
ziggurat which he built for her  
but where shall i build

    i can not say yet but on a dif-
ferent site it depends on the posi-
tions of the planets and on celestial
configurations offhand i can not
say where

  but what difference ismeddin
it is so written not only must
you pronounce the proper words and
have built the ziggurat correct in lo-
cation as well as structure but also
have gone through rites of purifica-
tion ending by passing through bit
nuri the bath of fire and even then
she will cross the border only under
certain conditions which you will
learn from these tablets explained
the old man and whether the ex-
periment can ever succeed is not as-
sured ismeddin indicated the
broken corner of one of the tablets
some of the text is missing her
hidden and secret name is lacking

without it-

but i know that name exulted
landon so describe me the zig-
gurat we will outbuild naram-sin 
but how do you know that lost
name

  i know what i know that of
all things i do know

  what is it saidi

  you are my teacher not i yours
that word was lost so that none could
call her before me it was revealed
to me  

  where in the shrine
the infidels daughter



  who can say evaded landon
so get to work on your calcula-
tions  

  and landon left the darvish to
mutter and fret over the tablets to
compute and predict planetary as-
pects

tay after day ismeddin labored
with his calculations growing
more and more somber sullen and
morose ever seeking to dissuade lan-
don from his madness and then
finally he brightened apparently re-
signing himself to the fatal folly of
his master

  it is solved saidi announced is-
meddin one day but it remains
to be seen whether you can call her
time has passed and the signs of
heaven have shifted so that instead
of on the plains of babil you must
build the ziggurat in feringhistan
thats a bit indefinite protested
landon feringhistan covers a lot
of ground really now ismeddin-
patience saidi patience i have
calculated the exact site of the zig-
gurat whereupon the old man
turned to a mercators projection of
the world and laid off the latitude and
longitude of the calculated point
marking its position with a pin
there you are my lord now pro-
nounce me the outlandish name of
that barbarous corner of feringhi-
stan

  i suppose i ought to bust your
jaw after the feringhi fashion and
then make you spend the rest of the
day singing columbia the gem of
the ocean then laughing at ismed-
dins perplexity landon continued
youve picked the united states of
america and that particular state
where i spent my younger days   
until i left for my health 

  ah then perhaps your health
would not permit your returning
anyway even your great wealth
would not be enough to build a zig-

gurat in that mad land where work-
men are paid such prodigious sums
for their labor

   its been a good many years now
and i  chance my health as to ex-
penses we have the money to back
us neither objection holds and the
next boat will take us to my native

land-

  native saidi but as foreign to
you as to me go back to herat to
your own great house where the
daughter of abdulrahman el durani
awaits you forget this luminous
peril this alluring apparition you
hasten to meet your doom  

 all of whch i know and aceept
so that i shall seek sarpanit the in-
fidels daughter and find her and
whatever doom she may bring to-
morrow we leave for beirut and then
on the first boat we shall sail for
america and this is the law ismed-
din so forget your objections and
serve me as faithfully in feringhistan
as you have in the lands of islam



rthe scaffolding and debris incident
to construction had finally been
cleared away the workmen had de-
parted and now from the crest of
a distant knoll landon contemplated
the colossal bulk of the tower that
rose loftily above the rolling plain
its first stage of black masonry just
topped the tallest trees of the sur-
rounding grove its successive stages
of diverse colors ascended in terraces
and culminated in a seventh and top-
most stage of gleaming white which
from its great height commanded the
plain and near-by town a lordly
monumental work modeled after but
surpassing that tower which long ago
had been reared from the plain of
babil to pierce the skies and provide
man with a stairway to the abode of
the gods


weird tales

  i wonder ismeddin if this
naram-sin built her such a house as
this ziggurat

  no master not like this and
when time comes to an end and the
last man seeks a place to pitch his
tent he must look elsvhere for no
camp will ever be made on the site of
this ziggurat neither the hand of
man nor the fires of heaven can ever

shake it under the lintel-

  let that be on my head also even
as the unutterable madness of this
quest against which you counseled
me in vain it was so prescribed
and i could but follow the text and
besides is it not an honor to be im-
mured beneath the lintel of a house
built for sarpanit   

  landon vaulted to the back of his
barbary stallion but before starting
down the slope paused to contem-
plate his work the sun had dipped
below the horizon so that all was ob-
scure on the plain below save the
loftily towering silver-white masonry
of the topmost stage

  naram-sin built her no such
house and she came across the bor-
der and danced before him on the
moonlit terraces of his ziggurat  

    and the incandescent madnessi of
the hundred and first kiss left him
seared and lifeless warned ismed-
din as he reined up beside the mas-
ter abandon it now saidi while
you still can

  no neither hells fire nor the
black hands of iblis can turn me
aside nothing can stop me

  you forget master suggested
ismeddin as their horses picked their
way down the slope that one thing
can stop you

  yes

  even so some girl of the vil-
lage just one slip and the infidels
daughter will not cross the border
for she is inhumanly jealous

  the village

  landon snorted his contempt

  you are more of a jester than a

darvish ismeddin i left my house
in herat and the daughter of an emir
to follow this madness into ferim-
ghistan to this very spot where you
say the avatar shall materialize  

  but under his badinage landon
was troubled at the thought of that
which he was attempting even as a
madman in his lucid moments is per-
turbed by the memory of his obses-
sion

  no haaji in the entire world
there is no woman who can equal her
who appeared in my pavilion on the
plain of babil her eyes were a
smoldering darkness and her voice a
purring rippling sweetness and
even yet her perfume lingers in the
rug on which she danced

  and then as he leaned forward in
the saddle the barbary stallion
stretched out in a smooth extended
gallop at the gate of the ziggurat
landon reined his horse back on his
haunches and dismounting tossed
the reins to ismeddin

  an hour later on emerging from
the third stage of the ziggurat lan-
don spoke of going to the village to
call for mail

 which horse will you ride
saidif

  neither ill walk

 and ismeddin who knew that a
horse is at times too much company
held his peace as landon on foot
left the ziggurat the old man opened
the outer gate slightly seated him-
self cross-legged in the shadow of one
of the monstrous winged bulls whose
mitered heads upheld the ceiling
and like the darvish he had once
been entered the silence

  at the post-office landon found a
letter awaiting him its seals seemed
intact at the sight of them he
frowned recognizing their device
tore the unopened letter in half then
pausing pieced it together and read
the fine persian script of the message
from herat once on the street he
the infidels daughter



wandered aimlessly passers-by
avoided him giving him the paving
shrinking from contact with that lean
man and avoiding the mordant glance
of those somber eyes

  they called him back to herat yet
in his native land he was a foreigner
stared at from a distance a distance
which was scrupulously kept

  landon wandered aimlessly and
wondered nor heeded the lady of the
evening who trailed him and with
professional allurements sought to in-
veigle him sought to ensnare him
until under the glow of a street
lamp she recognized her prospective
prey and recoiled before the somber
fierce eye that for an age-long instant
impaled her

  and then he stalked into the smoky
air of tiptoe inn seating himself at
a table apart from the others but
next to a booth occupied as he
judged from the murmur of conver-
sation

  shirazi wine    the reek of raw
com whisky from the hills    san-
dalwood and patchouli    the stench
of cigarettes tossed aside to smolder
to extinction    the plucked strings
of a sitar    the blatant screech and
moan of saxophones    the tinkling
mistily spraying fountains of herat
   the raucous rasping voice of a
cabaret singer   

  and the infidels daughter sar-
panit the bright and shining one
was to cross the border and appear in
this strange land   

  from the adjoining booth came the
purring voice of a woman who spoke
with the blurred indefinable accent
of one who speaks many tongues
louder than before but still softly
suavely though with the sting and
crackle of the lash in each finely
enunciated word

  it is true she declared that
all men are jackasses but to think
that im listening to the king of men
no she resumed interrupting her

companions protest i dont want
you nor your damned car nor your
apartment and that is that

  so youve become pious all of a
sudden perhaps youve forgot-
ten-

  a splash and a crash of glass

  you hell-cat ill-

  go to it heres luck

  landon glanced up in time to see
the high-spirited lady leaving the
booth trim ankles and dainty feet 
jade ear-pendants and rebellious
blue-black curls and a fine proudly
carried head and though her form
was concealed by her cape landon
knew that only a shapely well-pro-
portioned woman could achieve that
effortless undulant walk

  dont know who she is but she
sounds like a woman after my own
heart reflected landon then he
noted that while a few smiled ap-
proval as the victrix left the field of
battle there were other groups who
scowled and muttered to each other

  that bit of distraction had cracked
landons introspective gloom so that
on his way back to the ziggurat he
had no thought of the letter from
herat nor of the lurid star which
each night progressed farther into the
configuration described in the cunei-
form tablets strange how in the
face of a curious and uncertain doom
one can pause to laugh

  as landon entered the steel-barred
gate ismeddin emerged from his post
in the shadow of the winged bull

  master there was a visitor this
evening  

    indeed  

  yes look

  and ismeddin thrust before lan-
don s eyes a mask of vermilion-
colored silk the open gate tempt-
ed him and i    but i am an old
man and i was unarmed apolo-
gized ismeddin so he lost nothing
but his mask

weird tales

 very good haaji youre in
feringhistan where they discounte-
nance private graveyards if this
fellow had been found with a bit of
cutlery between his ribs or a cord
about his throat we might conceiv-
ably have some explaining to do
and remember were outnumbered
and were foreigners

 but in angor-lana one eve-
ning-

  i know ismeddin but this is
my native land   and landon
smiled sourly

one night a week later landon
thrust aside the three clay tablets
which he had been studying pro-
nouncing after ismeddin the age-old
tongue whose secret they had wrested
from the wedge-shaped characters
landons wrists and fingers were
numb from playing the snakeskin-
headed drum and his brain reeled
from the insinuant sorcery of the
rhythm he had coaxed therefrom

 ill ride tonight ismeddin
suleiman needs exercise and i need
a rest

  a few minutes later the old man
led the pawing belligerent stallion
from the stable landon mounted
and gave the fierce beast his head
letting him pick his course across the
moonlit plain mile after mile he
sped until finally lacking the urge
of the spur the stallion slowed down
to a walk landon relaxed in the
saddle dozed and dreamed of herat
and of the mound at koyunjik and
mixed into his wandering thoughts
ever recurring in one guise and an-
other was a girl with trim ankles and
jade ear-pendants

  a lurid star flamed over her head
   and as she set on her blue-blaek
hair a curiously wrought diadem the
piquant irregularity of her features
became softened transfigured into an
astonishing loveliness   

  the stallion came to an abrupt halt

waking landon with a jerk the
smell of smoke and smoldering wood
and the odor of tar fanned his nos-
trils and then he saw why sulei-
man had recoiled snorted and tossed
his head athwart the path almost
beneath the horses hoofs was a
woman sprawled in a heap uncon-
scious

 steady lad and then dis-
mounting he saw that the girl was
clad only in a slip of filmy silk torn
soiled and clinging in shreds to her
lacerated back and sides her
wrists were pinioned together with
a piece of clothes-line she was still
breathing and stirred faintly at his
touch

    well we cant leave her here   
i  be damned  

  landon recognized the girl of tip-
toe inn the insouciant one who had a
few nights ago so boldly declared her-
self as he cut the lashings from her
wrists she opened her eyes mur-
mured confusedly shrank from his
touch

  dont worry sister lets go
and so saying he picked up the half-
conscious girl mounted suleiman
and turned back toward the ziggurat
leaning forward in the saddle urging
the barbary stallion to a longer
stride

  at the gate of the ziggurat landon
tossed the reins to ismeddin who
took charge of the foaming suleiman
in due course if he so pleased the
master would say more of the
bruised disheveled burden he had
carried into the hall of winged bulls
and up the staircase flanked with
parading archers nevertheless the
darvish wondered and as he groomed
suleiman he smiled the first time
in many weeks smiled and hoped
that the woman was young and
lovely

  bismillahi rrahhmani irahheem
he ejaculated as he put the finishing
touches to suleimans silky coat and
the infidels daughter



polished his dusty hoofs praise be
to god lord of the worlds finding
her by chance and riding back as
though the black hands of abaddon
reached out after him    saidi may
this indeed be the daughter of some
infidel

  the old man chuckled at his own
play on words and stroked his white
beard

  please dont stand on formality
replied the girl as landon half an
hour later knocked at the door of
the apartment wherein he had left
his guest   come right in  

  well i didnt want to take you
at a disadvantage how do you feel
now

  more like myself thanks to a bit
of first aid

  i fancy weve met before re-
sumed landon at a distance that
is in the tiptoe inn a few nights

ago you were laying down the law

to some friend and ended by-

    christening him with a ginger ale
highball the girl laughed softly
then continued and here you see
the result  

  she shivered and drew more close-
ly about herself the brocaded robe in
which landon had wrapped her be-
fore leaving her to doctor her bruises
and lacerations

oh but
my shoulders
ache well
and it might
have been
worse i just
missed a coat
of tar and
feathers-

what

yes just

so take what is left of him nothing
but skin and bones


weird tales

that but one of the knights had a
kind-hearted streak so they merely
beat me with rawhide whips until i
passed out i dont know how long i
was lying there when you found me  
must have been an hour or so
come to think of it i did smell tar
along with the fire a couple of yards
to the side of the path but what
are these knights anyway de-
manded landon who had never even
in barbarous angor-lana seen a slave
so mercilessly flogged

  surely youve heard of the
knights of the saffron mask

  no tell me

   youll hear of them soon enough
if they learn im here theyre a
secret order-but how in the world
have you missed hearing of them
and where am i she questioned
glancing about her and indicating
the sculptured and tapestried walls

  all in due course please con-
tinue about these knights sug-
gested landon

   theyre self-appointed guardians
of public safety and morals and par-
ticularly of christianity in general
jews catholics and atheists are their
particular aversion as well as any-
one who is inclined to be unconven-
tional and whoever offends them is
introduced to tar feathers and the
lash witness myself once in a
while they make effective use of rope
and a tall tree 

   conducting a jehad under eover
so to speak

  exactly holy war describes the
doings of these bigots

   landon wondered that the girl had
 understood his phrase but held his
peace

   come to think of it i did hear of
 them and he told her of ismed-
 din s adventure with the masked
 intruder the very night of the episode
 at tiptoe inn self-appointed
 guardians    judging from my bit

of eavesdropping that night your
friends propositions werent any too

savory-

  no which was to be expected
rumor has it that he holds a high
command in the order the rank and
file are honest deluded bigots who
serve as a mask for blackmail rape
murder arson or whatll-you-have
perpetrated by their leaders extor-
tion revenge  see how the pretty
scheme works out camouflaged by
piety virtue and saffron masks
and landon wondered greatly
and marveled at the contrasting
crudeness and simplicity of the lands
of the moslem where he had spent
so many hard fierce years

  now tell me resumed the girl
again glancing about her where i
am

  among friends and landon
struck the small brazen gong at his
side

  pardon me i didnt mean to be
inquisitive

  you may as well improvise some
clothes continued landon ignoring
his guests apology until i can
equip yon more suitably   he picked
up the tom and soiled scrap of silk
that his guest had discarded in favor
of his lounge-robe this is a bit the
worse for wear you know tell me
where you live and ill call for your
baggage in the morningr

  just then ismeddin in response to
the masters summons entered with a
tray

  is that all saidi

  landon nodded whereupon the old
man left the master and his guest to
sip the night-black abyssinian coffee
he had brought in

   	 allah akbart but she is lovely  
he exulted oh excellent young
woman

  lord what coffee you are a
mind-reader stranger but no dont
go after my clothes youll just
the infidels daughter



draw the whole pack down on both
of us that clown at tiptoe inn
surely must hold a high command
among the knights or theyd never
have bothered me even if i am a
cabaret singer that towns no
longer safe for me theyd drag me
out of here if they knew i was here
and as for you helping me this

way-

 the devil you say snorted
landon youre safe here till the
crack of doom unless these fellows
get siege guns and batter the place
down over our ears and ill cer-
tainly get you some clothes and what-
ever else you need  

  dont be foolish pleaded the
girl they dont know im here
as long as they dont know were
safe ill make the most of things-
yes i have my nerve but i simply
have to invite myself to stay a few
days until this mess quiets down and
i can safely leave  

  fair enough just make yourself
at home if you can stand our queer
life see you in the morning  

  and landon left his guest to nurse
her bruises and make herself as com-
fortable as she could on her impro-
vised couch of several small silk rugs
and a few cushions

hphe signs of heaven were
- approaching the aspect called for
in the three tablets so that even after
such an outlandish night landon
after leaving his guest dismissed her
from his mind and devoted himself
to the rehearsing of the invocations
and secret names he was to use in
summoning sarpanit from across the
border in the seventh stage high
above the plain face to face with the
lords of the sign landon chanted
and beat the tiny drum with knuckles
and fingertips until it purred and
rolled in that same uncanny rhythm
to which the infidels daughter had
danced in the pavilion of koyunjik

  finally having reached the end of
the ceremonial landon arose from
his seat at the foot of the altar gazed
through the slits in the vaulted ceil-
ing of the seventh stage and out into
the shimmering darkness beyond in
each slit were cross-hairs of fine silver
wire so adjusted that at the instant
the lords of the sign had risen into
position each would be at the inter-
section of the wires in his particular
house and thus landon would know
that the moment had arrived when
the secret name of the infidels
daughter was to be pronounced sum-
moning her into his presence in mate-
rial form from across the abyss that
divides the phantom from its in-
carnation and as landon noted
that some of the powers were already
approaching their houses he knew
that the others in the course of but a
few days would swing into the pre-
scribed aspect knew and shuddered
at the thought of the awful forces
which he sought to command the ruin
and ultimate destruction that would
be his

  during the next few days landon
saw little of his protegee save at an
occasional meal but those few
glimpses were disturbing the
blurred indefinable accent of her
speech stirred a shadowy memory of
a memory and the haunting half
familiarity of her piquant irregular
almost lovely features upset his poise
and self-possession he found him-
self from time to time denying with
needless vehemence the speech of old
ismeddin wherein the darvish had
suggested that a girl of feringhistan
might lure him from his quest of
sarpanit who was inhumanly jealous

  the girl had amused herself by
taking pieces of hindustani fabrics
landon had given her and impro-
vising quaint outlandish apparel
which seemed to please her enormous-
ly  exotic pagan raiment which made
her fit into and become a part of her
surroundings


weird tales

  you are a clever designer but
you cant wear that outside of the
ziggurat hadnt i better go to town
and get you some clothes in which
you could travel   

well    yes   if im in the
way    or grating on your nerves 
oh not at all reassured lan-
don lying valiantly only i dont
want to keep you here against your

best interests the knights-

  never mind them unless i am
wearing out my welcome  

  no danger just stay away from
the seventh stage and stay away
from that bronze door whatever you
do otherwise the place is yours
but remember keep clear of the
seventh stage concluded landon
solemnly

  that afternoon landon rode to
town for mail which he was not
expecting he returned with a
mountainous aggregation of boxes
and parcels which by some miracle
he contrived to balance on his saddle-
bow  civilized apparel traveling-
clothes for his guest the cabaret girl

  ismeddin take this stuff up to
our guest he commanded

  very well saidi agreed the old
man but for such an agile spright-
ly veteran ismeddin was strangely
clumsy and feeble in his attempts to
collect and shoulder the assortment
of packages

  never mind countermanded
landon ill take them up in the
morning

  and that night after landon
had gone to the seventh stage to pass
through the purification by water and
fire the girl and the darvish met in
what she called her throne-room

  thanks for the coffee ismeddin
but thats not why i rang for you
to hear is to obey bibi

  then sit down and listen to me
the master brought home a load of

traveling-clothes for me this eve-
ning-

 who am i to say evaded
ismeddin

  you neednt say i know what
i know now tell me the truth just
how anxious is the master to get me
out of here

  ismeddin marveled that he could
no more resist that girls compelling
eye than he could the masters and
strangely he did not resent the fact

  i will tell you the truth your
presence disturbs the masters stud-
ies

  indeed

  the girls eyebrows rose in sara-
cenic arches and she smiled as one
who is more pleased than amused

  then tell me ismeddin she
purred in the rippling syllables of a
language the darvish had not heard
for many months tell me what man-
ner of studies he pursues and how i
could possibly disturb his medita-
tions you can trust me ismed-
din she continued ignoring his
amazement at hearing that unexpect-
ed language and speak to me freely
for i have seen and heard without
having intended to eavesdrop and
i know that you were pleased at my
arrival even as i know also that you
did not care to bring me my travel-
ing-clothes this evening  oh but
it is very strange haaj ismeddin   
yet i know many things  so tell
me more wise haaji    what man-
ner of studies does the master pursue
and how could i disturb him

  again her eyebrows rose in pointed
arches and her eyes smoldered
through their long lashes loyalty
to the master melted under that
mordant burning gaze reticence
and reserve fell asleep drugged by
those rippling caressing tones of a
familiar tongue

   and thus it is   concluded the
darvish that the master fears that
tiie infidels daughter



  even your presence in the very base-
  ments of this tower would arouse the
  inhuman jealousy of sarpanit whom
  he seeks to summon from across the
  border fears that she will not reveal
  herself in human form fears that he
  will be cheated of his doom and
  robbed of the fiery destruction of the
  hundred and first kiss which in the
  end she bestows  her lovers  

    and you haaji murmured the
  girl strangely enough she had
  heard the old mans mad tale of the
  infidels daughter without surprize
  or amazement accepting it as of all
  things in the world the most logical
  and reasonable and you haaj
  ismeddin do you share his fears   
  i by the black hands of abad-
  don if you could only save him
  from himself whoever and what-
  ever you are bibi  if only    but
  no you could not even pass the bra-
  zen door tomorrow night your pres-
  ence there in that holy of unholies
  would break the powerful spell he in-
  tends to chant and she would not
  cross the border but your being in
  any other place in this ziggurat
  would not suffice and a hundred
  men could not batter down that heavy
  door nor the most cunning smith

  piek its locks and bars-

    once it is closed no the girl
  smiled and patted her dusky coiffure
  and i will not leave in the morn-
  ing as he designs haaji 

   tsmeddin  began landon the next
  morning as the old man entered
  with the masters meal of barley
  cakes and water how long must one
  shelter a stranger who has eaten ones
  bread and salt   

    your enemy may stay three days
and for a whole day after his de-
 parture you may not pursue him
but this girl is not my enemy

  though her presence-

    saidi as long as she does not
  enter the seventh stage her presence

makes no difference so that though
she can now leave in safety you can
scarcely send her away lawfully
yes but when did you ever urge a
guest to leave you are not of
feringhistan you could not ask a
guest to leave saidi and she does
no harm if she should enter the
seventh stage    but she can not do
that  

  and then the girl herself entered
landons apartment

  how can i ever thank you those
clothes are really adorable only   
forgive me for mentioning it  i
simply couldnt leave here bare-
footed  

  barefooted why i included

shoes 

  then you must have lost them on
the road im so sorry  

  ill replace them tomorrow no
trouble whatever but in the mean-
while concluded landon pausing
at the door ill be very busy sure-
ly youll pardon my haste

  ismeddin following the master
wondered what had become of the
pair of shoes that had fallen from a
mountainous heap of parcels he had
that morning carried to the girls
apartment

  it is written saidi observed the
old man she must stay another
day surely you could not send her
away barefooted

  very well then but tomorrow
morning  no matter what happens
tonight-

  i understand saidi if she ap-
pears from across the border the girl
will leave

tt was late that night when landon
in the seventh stage of the ziggu-
rat completed the final purification
by passing through fire and then
barefooted and robed in purple he
stepped into the center of a circle of
powdered cinnabar which flamed


weird tales

luridly in the violet light of the ady-
tum of the infidels daughter on
his head was a three-storied miter
woven of purple plumage on his
wrists were bracelets of silver and
around his throat he wore a collar of
hammered bronze in his right hand
he carried a diadem of curiously
wrought silver and in his left was a
tiny drum whose head was of ser-
pents hide

  at the center of the circle he knelt
bowed low in obeisance then rose
and advancing toward the altar of
unsculptured stone placed thereon
the drum and the diadem

  infidels daughter this is the
drum to whose cadence you shall
dance to the evening star on the ter-
races of the house which i have built
for you and this is the diadem you
shall wear when you reign in this
house which rises to the heavens to
meet you and all this is proof that
i sought you on the mount of the
infidel as you commanded

  then inclining his head for a mo-
ment he retreated to the circle of
cinnabar raised his arms and began
his invocation haltingly at first and
then more surely and firmly as the
spirit of those ancient words over-
came him

  flaming lords of the two horizons
and watchers of the treble gates
stand one at the right and one at the
left as the star of sarpanit rises to
his throne and rules over- his sign
he intoned as he gazed through the
central cruciform cleft in the ceiling
looking out into blackness beyond
that great height and you dark
princes of aralu open the gates of
that dim land where you keep her
imprisoned and release her once
more to spread gladness and wo with-
out end over this earth which dries
and wanes lacking her presence
hear ye hear ye hear ye dark lords
and shining presences and by your
secret names which i know and can

pronounce hear ye and obey my
will

  pausing in his invocation he drew
from a pouch at his girdle a small
vial whose contents he poured in a
circle about him concentric to and
within the circle of cinnabar and
as the fluid touched the floor it burst
into quivering lapping flames whose
spectral blueness exhaled a poison-
sweetness which overwhelmed the
dense fumes rising from the censers
that smoldered at each side of the
altar

  belit nuri he resumed light
of heaven and earth sarpanit shin-
ing torch of heaven return from
aralu seven times and seven times
have i passed through fire food have
i not eaten sorrow was my nourish-
ment  water have i not drunk grief
was for my thirst i am adon for
whom you wept i am the lord of
the great house i am the builder of
the ziggurat and it is i who call you
from aralu from the gloomy realm
of ereshkigal it is i who summon
you from across the border belu
nuri lady of light-

  statuesquely with formal preci-
sion he made gestures reminiscent of
the mitered kings who in the lower
halls of the ziggurat rode to battle
and poured libations on lofty altars
and all the while he chanted in that
dim forgotten tongue summoning
the infidels daughter from across
the border

  it is i who seek you bint el
kafir who danced before me on the
mound of koyunjik therefore ride
on your lions past the throne of alla-
tu and appear before me sarpanit
bright and shining one

  the lord of the sign rose into the
predicted configuration great clouds
of purple smoke choking and blind-
ing rose from the censers and over-
whelmed landon with their awful
sweetness but still he chanted and
then as the star hung for an instant
the infidels daughter



on the silver cross-hair in the cleft
flaming like an incandescent bead on
a string of light he raised his arms
and called in a great voice that final
word the uttermost and hidden name
of the infidels daughter come
from across the border kadishtu
the blue flames shrank into black-
ness landon collapsed sprawling
across the edge of the cinnabar circle
his three-staged miter rolled to the
foot of the altar uncrowned and
mocked by the star that flamed its
way up the silver cross-hair landon
lay senseless in the darkness of the
shrine sacred to the bright and shin-
ing one



that very evening shortly after
nightfall the knights of the
saffron mask met in secret conclave
under cover of darkness they slunk
in pairs down side streets and alleys
uncouth figures in robes and miters
converging in all directions toward
their rendezvous in the basement of a
house at the outskirts of the village

  good evening brethren greet-
ed the grand master with punctilious
solemnity as he ascended the rostrum
be seated

  whereat the knights took seats
and respectfully awaited the opening
of the book of seals wherein were
inscribed not only the rules and min-
utes of the order but also in the
appendix the names of offenders
actual as well as prospective the list
of the proscribed and the proceed-
ings instituted against them

  tonight began the grand mas-
ter we shall try and sentence this
landon whose manifold iniquities
have become a disgrace and a scan-
dal to this christian community
brethren what is your good pleas-
ure   

  let him be tried intoned forty
voices in the monotone of a litany
and let him be sentenced and let

this sentence be forthwith executed
  who prefers a charge

  a dozen robed figures leaped to
their feet

  with a gesture the grand master
yielded the floor to one of them

  master began the knight this
man is an infidel he worships the
sun and moon and the hosts of
heaven  

 what proof have you de-
manded the grand master

  ive seen him on the terraces of
his tower making strange gestures
to the evening star and bowing to
the morning star  

  for this he shall be stripped and
flogged and driven from the county  
decreed the master

  let it be recorded chanted the
assemblage in unison

  the scribe at the grand masters
elbow wrote on the pages of the book
of seals

  what further charges de-
manded the chief and again singled
out one of those who had taken the
floor

  hes an atheist one day when
he was riding through town the par-
son invited him to attend church
and this landon thanked him with
supercilious politeness but-told him
he didnt believe in churches

  and before the scribe could record
this charge another knight assumed
the floor

  this man is a blasphemer he
claims his tower will outlast the
world itself

  h-m-m    yes that is blas-
phemy scribe did you get that
demanded the grand master lapsing
from the stilted phrases of the ritual
what else have we got on this fel-
low

   hes living with that de las
torres woman we ran out of town a
while ago ventured another un-


weird tales

easily as though picking his way over
quicksands

the devil he is flared the
grand master   how do you know   
well me and judson were watch-
ing that tower with a field-glass one
evening and we saw her dancing on

the what did you call it-

  terrace

  yeah terrace thats the word
something like a hula dance only
worse and what little clothes she
did wear was scandalous  

 so that bird found herself a
home did she after we told her to
clear out

  aint nothin else but that mas-
ter

  did he get our warning letter
telling him to get rid of the girl   
sure did master i saw him at
the post-office readin it and then he
tore it up and grinned and a couple
of days later he came to town to get
her some clothes and trappings
enough thundered the grand
master resuming his dignity
order please we have enough to
hang this fellow a dozen times and
especially the girl the way she was
corrupting the town

 at this last remark several
knights turned their masked faces
and choked coughs which sounded
strangely like snickers

  well take the place by surprize
tonight he has only that one old
man for a servant right

  you said it master but hes a
hard old duffer nearly strangled
me one night i tried to look into
things while his boss was away re-
plied one of the forty

  does he always leave his front
door open continued the grand
master

   used to but now he keeps it
barred

  any secret entrances or exits
from which he could escape

  there used to be announced a
knight who had worked as a laborer
during the construction of the ziggu-
rat but theyve been blocked up
well then weve got him sewed
up declared the master but
how about that front door i hear
its made of heavy steel bars we
couldnt saw in a month of sun-
days  

  thats simple volunteered one
of the conclave ill take an acet-
ylene torch from my shop and we can
cut those bars in a few minutes even
if theyre a couple of inches thick
easy enough

  very good brother all of you
at  a m be prepared to raid him
well tar and feather the both of
them or while were at it    yes
bring some rope we might change
our minds remember we start from
here at  a m dismissed

  the knights rose and bowed the
grand master acknowledged their
reverence and the conclave dis-
solved

  to hell with the man muttered
the grand master as he stepped from
the rostrum its that hell-cats
hide i want and he wiped his
chin in memory of a certain tete-a-
tete in a booth at tiptoe inn



 slender nebulous presence
emerged from the shadows of
the holy of holies of the seventh stage
of the ziggurat coming from behind
the hangings to the left of the altar
and picking its way through the
gloom the apparition paused at the
altar steps and one by one struck
light to the fifteen sacred candles be-
fore the shrine then turning from
the altar the girl knelt beside the
ziggurat builder
the infidels daughter



  couldnt you wait    did you
have to cross the border to meet
her 

  the touch of her fingertips and
the murmur of her voice aroused
landon

    sarpanit    bright and shining
one     he muttered as he opened
his eyes then collecting himself
and in the flickering light of the can-
dles recognizing his protegee you
what are you doing here flames
and damnation he thundered ris-
ing and snatching the girl to her
feet you and your curiosity   
meddling fool he continued and
then releasing her wrist glared at
her transfixing her for an age-long
instant with the mordant hatred of
his eyes if strangling you would
do any good 

 a petty rage is expressed in
violence but a great wrath can not
quite conceive the vengeance for
which it blindly gropes so that lan-
don instead of tearing his evil genius
into smajl pieces seated himself
wearily on the altar steps head
bowed in despair shoulders drooping
with the burden of adventurous
years perilous quests soul-racking
studies and speculations beaten
cracked broken a colossus shattered
by an idle gust of wind

  sarpanit    bright and shining
one  i have failed you 

  you have failed me breathed a
voice at his side speaking in the rip-
pling forgotten tongue of agade
looked me full in the face and did
not see me    look again adon
adon for whom i once went into
mourning in another avatar 

  the girl took the silver diadem
from the altar set it upon the abys-
mal blackness of her hair patted her
dusky coiffure and smilingly re-
garded landon the piquant irregu-
larity of her features was softening
into a loveliness the like of which he
had seen but once before the cabaret
girl he had a moment before cursed

as his evil genius was before his very
eyes merging her identity with that
of the apparition which had once
danced in the pavilion on the mound
of koyunjik the girl and the vi-
sion were fusing into one into a
radiant and unbelievable beauty

  bint el itajir landon stared
incredulously as one who has thrust
upon him in one swift moment all the
confusion and doubt of a lifetime
infidels daughter    and yet a
moment ago    sarpanit

  and before that unearthly radiance
landon sank to his knees stricken
with an overwhelming wonder for-
getful of all save the transfiguration
the immeasurable loveliness of the
infidels daughter whose low voice
murmured incredible words

  you have seen and now you be-
lieve ismeddin sought to save you
from your fate by putting your com-
putations in error so that the stars
to which you chanted your mummer-
ies were not those that ruled my
avatar yet he knew that by the
force of your desire you might call
me from across the border and thus
despite his deception he was uneasy
and conspired with the cabaret girl
your guest to tempt you from sar-
panit incarnate and tangible but
it made little difference what you
said what rites you performed or
omitted what stars were at the zenith
or nadir i am here adon as i
promised 

 landon raised his eyes then
dropped them before the increasing
splendor and glory of the infidels
daughter

  it mattered little she con-
tinued for the force of your desire
and the spell of your vision sufficed
i danced before you in your pavilion
at koyunjik and sang to you of the
hundred and one strange kisses
and i whispered in your ear the
missing name the hidden name which
even ismeddin did not know    ka-
dishtu    now do you believe


weird tales

  thus despite the mummeries you
performed despite the ziggurat you
built i came from across the border
and assumed mortal form there-
fore rise and admire the full splen-
dor of that which you yourself cre-
ated  for there are no gods save only
those created by the fancy of man

  and landon godlike and exalted
rose to claim the first of the hundred
and one strange kisses



tn accordance with their plan the
saffron-robed avengers gathered
in the grove about the ziggurat and
in double column marched to the
massive gate which as they had ex-
pected was locked and barred

- one of the knights drew from
beneath his robe a small cylinder of
acetylene another had regulating
valves a torch and hose and finally
a small cylinder of compressed oxy-
gen these parts were swiftly
assembled then the striking of a
match and a broad flare of flame
which diminished in size and in-
creased in intensity as the oxygen was
cut in so that when it was adjusted
there was but a fine pencil of blue-
white flame an eighth of an inch
long but of dazzling unearthly bril-
liance the knights averted their
faces as one of their number ad-
vanced with the hissing tip of flame
and applied it to one of the bars a
tiny spot on the metal became red-
hot and then as the operator re-
leased the cutting jet a shower of
incandescent steel sprayed onto the
paving and in a few seconds the
bar was cut clean as though sawed
through again and again the
torch was applied until five bars
were cut and then the flame was
cut off leaving the darkness trebly
black by contrast

  the avengers paused awestricken
by the black depths beyond them

 follow me commanded the
grand master stepping forward into
the breach

  one of the knights flashed an elec-
tric torch another followed suit
slim pencils of light revealed a stair-
case leading to the second stage of
the ziggurat noiseless as shadows
they picked their way up thickly
carpeted steps

 not a word was whispered the
silence hung like an oppressing fog
and then the knights emerging
on the second stage of the ziggu-
rat found themselves in a room
pervaded with a pale shimmering
twilight which revealed the ascent to
the succeeding stage flanked by grim
foreboding figures of winged bulls
whose human heads bearded and
mitered stared solemnly at the inva-
ders

  out of the shadows leaped a white-
bearded apparition ismeddin seeing
that flight was impossible was de-
termined to render a good account of
himself twice he fired and then
his pistol jammed his long-bladed
kanijar rose and fell in the melee
until the tap of a blackjack swept
away the old mans senses in one
paralyzing instant

  the wounded were carried to the
ground level the remainder ad-
vanced searching each apartment of
the lower stages working their way
up stage by stage to the last at
whose great door they paused

  out of the silence came the rich
tones of him they sought lifting his
voice in sonorous foreign accents
and then the tinkle of bracelets and
a womans laughter

  weve got them both exulted
the grand master he tried the door
found it barred bring on the
torch  

  again that fierce flame flared wide
and then drew down to a pencil of

his shadowy figure made a mocking
gesture

my acquaintance with
jean lafitte in the begin-
ning was of the most casual
nature in short my household was
one of a considerable number that
maintained the prosperity of his
really excellent grocery

  when shortly after the removal of
my residence to new orleans i dis-
covered the name of the grocer with
whom my wife had established trade
it impressed me as being singularly
unsuited to his occupation as a
matter of fact i thought it ridicu-
lous that any commonplace career
should appeal to one who bore the
name and who my wife informed
me claimed descent of that olden
robin hood of barataria

  i am possessed of a romantic streak
which even the exigencies of modern
business have not keen entirely able
to overcome and for some time this
led me into the habit of personally
settling my monthly account at
lafittes

  i was not disappointed with la-
fittes personal appearance for he
proved to be a small courtly-man-
nered individual with excellently
modeled head and features a slight-
ly swarthy complexion but served to
set off his fine eyes to better advan-
tage although i observed a touch
of pathos in their depths and an ex-
pression of faintly bitter resignation
which i then could not account for
i had the explanation some time aft-

                                   


weird tales

erward when i accidentally discov-
ered that the parish records vouch-
safed descent to my grocer not from
the gallant jean but from his less
appealing brother pierre lafitte
and a mulatto mistress such lack
of fastidiousness on the pirates part
promptly dispelled my fanciful inter-
est in his progeny and thereafter i
substituted the use of the mails for
the payment of my grocery bills in-
stead of presenting my checks in
person

  more than a year passed following
the cessation of my periodic visits
to his establishment before i again
as i thought came into contact
with the grocer under peculiar cir-
cumstances i happened to be hunt-
ing ducks at the time near the east-
ern reaches of barataria bay and it
struck me as a singular coincidence
that i should find him in the same
country where his picturesque an-
cestor once held sway

  i had become separated from the
other members of my party and the
realization that i had hopelessly lost
my bearings was gradually forced
upon me in attempting to retrace
my steps toward the distant quarter
in which i believed my companions
to be i was further confused to come
upon a small bayou which failed to
impress me with any sense of famil-
iarity

  while engaged in seeking a place
where the heavy sluggish water was
shallow enough for me to wade
across in my hip-boots without the
necessity of a thorough wetting i
was relieved to observe the figure
of what i took to be another hunter
upon the opposite side of the bayou

t succeeded in crossing the stream
without much difficulty and hast-
ened to accost the stranger-about
whom there was something vaguely
familiar as i approached him it
suddenly dawned upon me that he
was none other than that jean la-

fitte who sold me groceries simul-
taneously i observed that his nonde-
script and yet picturesque attire
would more appropriately have
served that other lafitte who pos-
sibly stood upon the same ground
when barataria was a pirate strong-
hold

  a long sleeveless cloak curiously
faded and weathered and conveying
an impression of impossible age
draped from his shoulders to below
the tops of equally aged leather
knee-boots a broad-brimmed low-
crowned hat of apparently the same
vintage as cloak and boots drooped
over the sallow face where care ap-
peared to have graven deeper lines
than i remembered

  i thought for a moment that the
fellow seemed vexed as i hailed him
he hesitated for a perceptible in-
stant and then slightly shrugging
his shoulders answered my greeting
civilly enough although without
cordiality

  i am certainly glad to see you
lafitte i said and observed that
he gave a slight start as i pro-
nounced the name and regarded me
with uncalled-for surprize

  indeed monsieurf he ques-
tioned

  lafitte spoke english with the cu-
rious inflection so often encountered
in the southern parishes of louisiana
even upon the tongues of some who
are of a third or fourth generation
of born americans he had never
before addressed me as  monsieur
however and the use of the french
title struck me as an affectation pos-
sibly impelled by some conceit asso-
ciated with his present surroundings

  i surely am i affirmed ive
been floundering around in this con-
founded swamp all morning and
just about decided that i dont know
where i am i havent even heard a
gunshot for the last hour or more

  in which direction does monsieur
desire to proceed    asked lafitte
the sword op jean lafitte



  back to that so-called railroad
at le boeuf station   i informed
him conscious of a rising distaste for
his continued use of the french mode
of address

  that is fortunate nodded la-
fitte for i am bound in the same
general direction and i shall be
more than pleased to guide monsieur
to le boeuf

  there it was again and my rather
childish irritation gave vent to ex-
pression as i reminded him a trifle
shortly

  youve sold me enough groceries
as mister stuart to be able to get
along without all that monsieur
foolishness havent you lafitte

  i was immediately ashamed of the
outburst for which there was little
enough real reason but consoled my-
self with the reflection that the
damned nigger-even if he was al-
most white-was a bit too fond of
histrionics

  none the less my rebuke produced
a dangerous gleam in laflttes deep
eyes and he stiffened ominously
the appearance of swiftly mounting
wrath gave way however to an al-
most immediate expression of quizzi-
cal surprize and what appeared to
be sudden and amused comprehen-
sion i confess to a distinct relief at
seeing the blaze die out of those
brilliant eyes for the momentary
flash brief as it was had given me a
glimpse of something potentially
dangerous in their depths i repeat
therefore that i experienced a relief
even disproportionate to the incident
when lafitte lifted his shoulders in
their habitual gesture and smiled
amusedly-a little contemptuously i
have since believed

  so he queried you buy gro-
ceries from one jean lafitte in new
orleans and because you consider
him a very commonplace person
object that i-he-finds it natural
so close to barataria bay to speak in

the fashion of that-that other-jean
lafitte   

  i answered him with his own trick
by shrugging my shoulders whereat
he faintly smiled again and nodded

  please pardon my unwitting of-
fense mr stuart one will surely
be safe in asserting that jean lafitte
-the grocer-highly values your
good will

  i was strongly suspicious that the
rascal found something ki his last
statement to furnish him secret
amusement  but i could not be sure
so offered no comment beyond a non-
committal grunt

  the fact was that lafitte impressed
me in a curious and vaguely disquiet-
ing manner i was at a loss to ac-
count for the indefinable antipathy
his presence inspired in me for even
in barataria and despite what i
then considered his theatrical man-
ner i refused to regard him as other
than a moderately prosperous grocer
-and a not-quite-white grocer at
that

we trudged on in silence for a
while lafitte setting a course
almost at right angles to the direc-
tion i had been following finally
partly as a relief to the monotonous
lack of conversation which my guide
seemed indifferently disposed to rem-
edy and partly to shake off the un-
reasonable disquiet which i experi-
enced in his proximity i hazarded a
remark

  i did not know you were in the
habit of taking holidays in the bara-
taria country lafitte i said

  nor am i was his grave reply
i have not had a holiday in bara-
taria or elsewhere in more years
than you would be likely to credit
should i tell you just how many
does one flounder through these
swamps  business then i asked
with a short laugh at the same
time i noticed a fact that had pre-
viously escaped my definite attention


weird tales

in addition to his queer attire neither
was lafitte armed for hunting as
well as i was able to determine

  more men have sought these
swamps with serious intent than have
come for pleasure moodily an-
swered lafitte breaking the thread
of my thoughts there was another
flash of that latent ferocity i had
previously noted as he added some
few have come to bide here the hour
of vengeance

  i made no comment nor did la-
fitte seem to expect any i could
make neither heads nor tails of his
erratic talk and what with the wild
and positively uncanny expression
that frequently replaced the air of
calm melancholy i had grown to as-
sociate with him i began to enter-
tain an uneasy suspicion that the fel-
low might lie more or less unbalanced
mentally-although the idea was cer-
tainly discounted by what i knew of
him

  at about this time however i was
further perplexed to observe that al-
though we were almost constantly on
boggy ground and frequently wading
in mud or shallow water lafittes
boots and long el oak were utterly
free of any stain in witness of the
fact the full shock of this phenome-
non did not strike me until i after-
ward recalled it in the light of later
events my attention was diverted
at the moment by the appearance of
the mississippi river levee which
confronted us as we broke through a
concealing patch of tall sugar-cane

  the wretched little railroad track
ran almost in the shadow of the levee
and lafitte informed me that le
boeuf station was only about two
miles above us around the bend of
the river he suggested that i might
see for myself from the embankment
and as its summit furnished an easy
and natural highway to my destina-
tion we made the ascent

  sure enough i discerned the set-

tlement at no great distance up the
river

  at this juncture lafitte called my
attention to a vessel that was round-
ing a lower bend of the great river
which rolled majestically below us
and forging slowly upstream in our
direction his face retained a mask
of impassivity but his eyes were like
glowing coals alive with suppressed
but exultant excitement

  examining the craft whieh was
smaller than the usual ships of com-
merce and yet had one funnel more
than is customary i remarked to la-
fitte that she seemed to be some sort
of small warship this fact in it-
self afforded me no clue to the rea-
son of his interest but he nodded an
eager affirmative

  ah he exclaimed a warship
indeed and does monsieur observe
the flag she flaunts

  why yes i acknowledged after
a moments further gating it is the
mexican flag and as we are expect-
ing her arrival for general overhaul-
ing in the dry dock of my company
at algiers i assume her to be the
gunboat tampico

  it is the tampico agreed la-
fitte it did not occur to me to ask
how he came to be so assured of this
fact since i happened to know that
the gunboat carried no nameplate-
and even if it had he could not pos-
sibly have made it out at that dis-
tance instead i remarked as an
afterthought

  it is quite possible that i shall
go with her when she returns to mex-
ico if the authorities will permit it
her commander is an old friend of
mine and he has several times asked
me to make a voyage with him as i
have to go to vera cruz anyway to
inspect another gunboat before plac-
ing a bid to repair it also i may take
advantage of his offer at this time

  to my great surprize lafitte ve-
hemently shook his head and urged
the sword of jean lafitte



do not follow your plan monsieur
-you must not

  displeased at the receipt of such
peremptory advice i was upon the
point of making a curt reply but the
fellow was so evidently in earnest
that curiosity concerning his motive
in objecting to a plan that did not
in the least concern him led me to
question him

    pray why not   i demanded

  because slowly answered la-
fitte   captain manuel de ruiz your
friend and the gunboats commander
is marked for the vengeance of jean
lafitte

  i do not know what reply i made
to this amazing statement or whether
i said anything at all but i do know
that my last doubt as to lafittes
mental condition left me then and
there probably he understood my
thought which would make clear his
reason for explaining to me as much
as he did-although why he should
care for my opinion is beyond me

  monsieur he began they will
tell you that jean lafitte-the jean
lafitte-perished in galveston or at
sea under the guns of this or that
man-of-war-some say an american
and some say an english vessel but
they are wrong when an american
warship bombarded galveston of
which lafitte was then governor it
is true that he was forced to flee the
island but he fled monsieur not to
sea where every mans hand was
against him but to the mainland

  the fugitive governor sought
sanctuary in old mexico where he
had many friends but alas he had
also many enemies and treachery
brought him full into the eager
clutches of the chief of them all one
don manuel de ruiz the governor of
matamoras

  lafittes face contracted with a
spasm of fierce and somehow terrify-
ing hate at the mention of the name
and he broke off his narrative to glare

malevolently at the approaching gun-
boat

  de ruiz was not one to pass by
the opportunity to settle an old
grudge he continued which was
only the more bitter because unjust
his end was attained by the simple
and expedient use of a firing squad
unattended by such superfluous tri-
fles as formality or pretense of jus-
tice  

  but where i interposed is
your authority for such statements
with proof your story becomes an
important contribution to history
but without such proof-and that of
a very definite nature-it remains
nothing more than another of many
interesting tales about the same
subject

  monsieur replied lafitte with
an enigmatic expression in his eyes
and contempt in his voice i who
know tell you what is the truth
proof i have none but i do not seek
to write history and i am little con-
cerned with what fate history may
assign to jean lafitte what does
concern me is the fact that as the
mexican governors ragged soldados
riddled his body with an uneven vol-
ley lafitte cursed de ruiz with his
final breath and sfivore vengeance on
him and all who bore his name after
him and monsieur the last de
ruiz the great-grandson and name-
sake of the murderer of jean lafitte
commands that teakettle yonder 

  at any rate i remarked a trifle
maliciously he does command it so
that lafittes curse can not have been
entirely efficacious  

  ah snarled my fanciful grocer
i still thought of him in that light
and found the fact amusing with
an air of baffled rage yet mon-
sieur the original de ruiz sickened
and died of a malady that baffled his
physicians shortly after the execu-
tion of his enemy the mexican had
laughed at lafittes curse but there
were those who remembered and


weird tales

shuddered and peons who crossed
themselves with dread when the gov-
ernor shrieked the baratarians name
in the last agony of death  

there was a pause while the
speaker seemed to be reviewing a
personal knowledge of the event he
had just described so detached and
earnest was his expression there
was about him also an air of gloat-
ing over that knowledge but even
so i could not forbear another sly
gibe at his story

  yet his great-grandson pros-
pers i remarked he is still a
young man and he will be a power in
mexico some day if he lives

  if he lives significantly agreed
lafitte he regarded me for a mo-
ment with a stony stare would
you know why he lives-why in-
deed his family was not wiped out
long before he was bom then
monsieur i will tell you it is be-
cause they buried the sword of jean
lafitte with his great-grandfather

  i think that i snorted outright at
this statement but lafitte continued
his remarkable narrative without
seeming to notice

  the superstition of the gover-
nors wife who had a carefully ig-
nored strain of indian blood in her
veins caused her to seek counsel of
her old indian nurse and the old
arm advised her mistress to do a
strange thing there is or was
monsieur a belief among some of the
native tribes of old mexico that if
a warriors weapons be buried with
his slayer the malignant spirit of the
former would be bereft of much of
its power to harm either the spirit of
his foe when death should claim him
also or those living ones beloved of
that foe   

  monsieur there is often wisdom
in what is termed the superstition of
ignorant savages since the death
of that old de ruiz his descendents

have struggled against something
more than mere ill fortune and they
have never greatly prospered in the
end-but at least they have sur-
vived thanks to the superstition of
an old indian woman

  i was strongly tempted to laugh
but something checked the impulse
by now i was firmly convinced that
there was a very decided quirk in my
grocers mental make-up his ap-
pearance and manner as well as his
extraordinary conversation caused
me to wonder if his present visit to
the old haunts of his pirate ancestor
had not through an association of
ideas finally developed a previously
obscure obsession and caused him to
confuse the identity as well as the
real or fancied wrongs of that other
jean lafitte with his own i re-
member also that i found time to
be amused that his vanity had caused
him to ignore the fact that he had
less to do with jean lafitte than with
his brother pierre

  i decided to be on my way to le
boeuf and thanked my guide for his
services he courteously assured me
of his pleasure at having been of
some slight assistance and then
added a final admonition against my
proposed trip aboard the tampico

  a revolution brews in mexico
monsieur he gravely informed me
and strange things often happen
when the passions of men are set
loose like wolves to harrass their
fellows the gates of hell have
waited overlong for jean lafitte and
i have a premonition that his buried
sword shall again see the light keep
off de ruizs tinpot monsieur

  i should certainly have answered
him in short and impatient fashion
except that with a final courtly bow
lafitte turned and climbed swiftly
down the levee and vanished into the
cane patch through which we had re-
cently come
the sword of jean lafitte



t watched him go with a feeling

	strangely like relief and vaguely
noticed that the tall close-growing
cane stalks did not even waver to
mark his passage i thought nothing
of that fact at the time and dis-
missing my late guide with a shrug
i turned toward le boeuf

  it was then midafternoon and i
found on arrival at the settlement
that my companions had not yet re-
turned from the hunt as i had
eaten nothing since a very early
breakfast my first interest was to sat-
isfy my hunger afterward my
mind was chiefly occupied with the
attempt to invent some sort of excuse
plausible enough to forestall or at
least diminish the inevitable chaffing
to which i should soon be subjected
for losing myself-to say nothing of
my failure to bag a single duck

  for this reason i completely for-
got my encounter with lafitte for the
time being and so made no mention
of it to the rest of the party when
it later recurred to me back home in
new orleans i casually remarked to
my wife that she need not be sur-
prized to hear at any time that her
grocer had been committed to a luna-
tic asylum naturally this state-
ment called for explanation and
when i had given it in complete de-
tail my better half regarded me with
a quizzical air

  you dont mean that all this hap-
pened three days ago she asked

  i nodded agreement unsuspecting
of the surprize in store for me

  then you had better be careful
dryly commented my wife because
i happen to know that lafitte was
run down and rather severely-injured
by an automobile ten days ago and
lias been confined to his bed ever
since 

 bunk i scoffed he may
have been hurt but he was surely up
and out last saturday  

  its not bunk and he wasnt

up insisted my wife because i
went to the store saturday afternoon
to select some things personally and
dr marvin was there at the same
time i heard one of the clerks ask
him how long it would be before la-
fitte would be able to get about and
the doctor told him that it would be
ten days or two weeks i shouldnt
be at all surprized was her added
and somewhat severe comment if
your duck-hunting party was like
some of the fishing parties you and
your precious friends go on

  not a drop i hastily assured
her not a single drop

  i was answered with an eloquent
sniff and i was aware that the sub-
ject was better dropped while my
wife is probably the finest woman in
the world and ordinarily reasonable
those of my readers who have been
married for any length of time will
at once understand my aversion to
debate with her along certain lines

  in the meantime the tampico had
been put in our dry dock that very
day and i was so busily engaged in
superintending the preparations for
her speedy repairing that i again
forgot my adventure in the barataria
swamps otherwise i should have
mentioned it to captain de ruiz soon-
er than i did when we were about
two-thirds finished with the job
however we were quietly asked to
work night and day to get the ship
finally conditioned and de ruiz con-
fided to me that although his govern-
ment had succeeded in suppressing
the news up to the moment a revolu-
tion was actually under way in
mexico

  this at once recalled to my mind
the warning lafitte had given me
and i told de ruiz the story al-
though i dealt as humorously as pos-
sible with the matter of the supposed
curse on the captains family-and
for that matter on the captain him-
self-he to my great surprize seemed
to regard it as not altogether a joke


weird tales

  why i remonstrated seeing
him suddenly so grave surely you
dont take serious stock in such rub-
bish

  there is a guarded story in my
family similar to the one told you on
the levee he quietly informed me
how do you account for your gro-
cers knowing of it then too what
of the fact attested by your own
wife and your family physician that
your lafitte was in bed with a broken
leg to say nothing of a few ribs at
the same time you were talking to
someone you thought was he

  you have me there i confessed
i cant figure it out any more than
you can but you may be sure of one
thing there is some perfectly logical
explanation one other thing also-
that explanation is not that i was
drunk as my wife more than half
suspected

  quien sabe murmured de ruiz
with a shrug

  who knows what i de-
manded whether or not i was
drunk  

  no no denied the captain with
a hearty chuckle in which i joined
although not quite so heartily

  at any rate i added i am
going to vera cruz with you if you
will take me and your consul general
will grant the necessary permission
it happened that permission was
readily granted me and the upshot of
it was that when the tampico slipped
down the river from new orleans i
sailed aboard her

nce we had passed the bar at the
 mouth of the mississippi we
steamed away at full speed for de
ruiz had urgent instructions to reach
vera cruz with all possible dispatch
the first night out passed without in-
cident and i was beginning to enjoy
the trip immensely i do not hesitate
to assert that regardless of what
may be said of their colleagues in the
army the commissioned personnel of

mexicos half-dozen gunboats is made
up of men who on the whole are
remarkably likable and intelligent
had those on board the tampico all
been insufferable boors and hopeless
morons the captains private stores
contained the wherewithal in unlim-
ited quantity and variety to make us
all feel comfortably fraternal

  i confess with the hope that this
may never be read by my wife to
having taken some pains on our sec-
ond night out to avoid belittling hos-
pitality-in bottled form-by refus-
ing it we expected to raise vera
cruz sometime the following day
with war and disaster in the imme-
diate offing so de ruiz his teniente
and i sat in the captains tiny salon
until late smoking and talking with
drinks at respectable intervals

  it may be that i drank too much-
although i think not-or it may have
been the sultry weather and the
closeness of my stuffy little stateroom
that caused me to dream as i did
when i finally turned in at any
rate i dreamed and rather remark-
ably

  it seemed that i saw a disorderly
group of swarthy men battering in
the door of what i took to be a tomb
or burial crypt i had the impres-
sion that they were mexicans of the
viler sort and more or less intoxi-
cated judging from the manner in
which they staggered about and the
inefficient way they handled the iron
bars with which they finally forced
the door

  i saw them drag out a moldy cas-
ket and batter it open what they
hoped to find i could not guess but
when they shattered the coffin and
exposed its contents there appeared
to be nothing but a heap of musty
bones but there was something else
-one of the villains stooped and held
up an object that i could not at first
distinguish but which i presently
saw to be a rust-encrusted sword of
antique pattern such as one sees in
the sword of jean lafitte



the shops of dealers in such objects
on the rue royal in new orleans
with evident disgust the fellow
flung the rusty weapon back upon the
ground then my dream faded into
nothingness

  it was hardly daylight when i was
awakened by insistent rapping upon
the door of my stateroom when i
finally dispelled the cobwebs from
my sleepy brain sufficiently to rise
and open the door my early caller
proved to be captain de ruiz i
stared at him for a moment still
stupid with sleep and then it dawned
upon me that my friend appeared
shaken and distressed and i hastily
bade him enter

  he slumped into a sitting position
upon the side of my bunk while i
waited for the explanation of his un-
seasonal visit he seemed greatly to
have regained his composure since i
first opened the door and hesitant to
speak-ashamed almost

  then he told me in exact detail
of a dream from which he had just
awakened and his dream in every
respect was identical with my own
to be sure this occasioned me some
surprize but the cause of his renewed
agitation when i told him that we
had dreamed in duplicate still did
not occur to me

  whats so exciting about it i
wanted to know its curious cer-
tainly but i dont see any reason to
be upset

  la espada cried de ruiz

    the sword   i stupidly repeated
then the light dawned you

mean-

  the sword of jean lafitte de
ruiz answered my unspoken ques-
tion it was my great-grand-
fathers tomb we saw he has his
sword-lafitte i mean

  nonsense i sharply informed
him-partly to cover up my own puz-
zlement i was not so very sure my-
self

  i have not the matter-of-factness

of you americans my friend be-
sides i have heard this tale of the
sword of jean lafitte too many times
from my old indian nurse-that and
other things i am absolutely con-
vinced that drunken revolucionistas
-or drunken federalist as quien
snbef-unearthed the sword last
night perhaps they thought to find
treasure in the tomb perhaps-

  he permitted the sentence to re-
main unfinished and after a moody
moment smiled as if in self-ridicule
and lighted a cigarette his com-
posure seemed suite restored and he
still smiled as i good-naturedly
chaffed him about his superstitions
it was still faintly in evidence as he
left me but i noticed that his face
was dead-white

tvjt oodily i proceeded to dress my-
self after first ringing for an
orderly to bring me a small cup of
black coffee in the hope of dispelling
the weight which seemed to have set-
tled upon my spirits the coffee
heartened me somewhat and having
no desire for further breakfast i
sought the deck to try if the early
morning air would not additionally
stimulate my mind to cheerful
thoughts

  to my dismay it had precisely the
opposite effect the sulking sun
hardly clear of the horizon was a
murky ball anything but provocative
of cheerfulness the air was still and
sultry and seemed even more de-
pressing on the deck than in the close
confines of my meager stateroom

 i am glad we shall make vera
cruz this afternoon confided lieu-
tenant morales the tampicos second
in command i am afraid there is
going to be some foul weather i
dont like the looks of things

  i dont like it either i mut-
tered  but whether i had reference to
the weather as morales naturally un-
derstood or to the uneasy and appar-
ently unfounded forebodings that op-


weird tales

pressed my mind i hardly knew
myself

  my own unrest i gradually ob-
served seemed to be shared quite
generally although nobody else ap-
peared conscious of the pervading air
of gloom i am afraid that most of
the officers had imbibed a little too
freely the night before-as indeed i
may have also done-in a last merry
fling before facing the serious duties
awaiting them swollen heads and
fuzzy palates would have accounted
for their sourness but nothing of the
sort explained the sullen uneasiness
with which the members of the crew
went about their varied routine the
very atmosphere seemed surcharged
with dismal prophecy

  then late in the forenoon with
our port but a few scant hours away
it happened

  lieutenant morales had just im-
parted the information that the cap-
tain had remained locked in his
stateroom all morning denying en-
trance to all save his orderly who re-
ported him to be drinking pro-
digiously-already hopelessly drunk
in fact hardly had the words been
uttered when de ruiz gave them the
lie by himself appearing on deck if
he was drunk i thought he cer-
tainly carried his liquor well there
was a noticeable firmness to his step
as he strode past where we stood
without appearing to notice us and
climbed the ladder to the bridge

  i noticed that his eyes were un-
naturally bright and morales di-
rected attention wonderingly to a
detail even more remarkable under
the circumstances

  porque la espadaf he asked of
no one in particular

  i also wondered why the sword
now that i observed it hanging at
the captains side he was in fa-
tigue uniform and just barely di-
sheveled and the glittering orna-
mented weapon looked out of har-
mony with the rest of his ensemble

had it not been incongruous in the
first place

  the nameless half-formed dread
which had oppressed me all morning
now seemed stronger than ever and
i had a sudden conviction that my
intuition was about to be justified

   mira  ejaculated morales
clutching my arm

  i looked as he bade and beheld de
ruiz upon the bridge with his gleam-
ing sword drawn thrusting before
him at the empty air followed the
most remarkable exhibition of sword-
play it has ever been my lot to wit-
ness the captains blade leaped in
and out like a thing alive glittering
dully ominous in the grudging rays
of the murky sun cut and thrust
thrust and parry while the gaping
crew looked on de ruiz handled his
sword exactly as if it crossed an-
other held in the hand of a deadly
opponent yet the bridge was
empty save for him alone

  from where i watched spell-
bound the captains pallor was easily
discernible and i could see also his
clenched teeth and the desperate set
of his jaw drunk or sober it was a
deadly serious business to him at any
rate he seemed to be getting a
shade the worst of his imaginary en-
counter for he slowly retreated to
the bridge ladder and having gained
it leaped swiftly down upon the deck
after a whirlwind of thrusting that
might have been to give him the in-
stants respite necessary to accom-
plish the feat in safety

  swiftly de ruiz turned and i dis-
tinctly heard his growl of cornered
rage as his sword again leaped up to
ward and fend he was strictly on
the defensive now and gradually
backed to the companion stairs inch
by inch step by step he seemed
forced relentlessly backward fi-
nally with the same preliminary fury
of thrusting that had marked his de-
scent of the bridge ladder the cap-
tain disappeared below
the sword of jean lafitte

  officers and crew surged forward
to follow but morales awoke from
the stupefaction into which he had
been thrown with the rest of us at
seeing his commander fight an ap-
parently desperate duel with thin air
and hastily posted a couple of ma-
rines at the head of the stairway to
hold back the crew then he fairly
leaped down the precarious flight of
steps i immediately behind him and
several officers close upon my heels
we rushed pellmell for the captains
salon where we could hear de ruiz
moving about swearing with low ve-
hemence that ended even as we ran
in a sudden choked groan

  as the lieutenant gained the door-
way of the salon he stopped short
so that i almost bowled him over so
close was i behind him i was taller
than he and could easily see over his
shoulder-and what i saw caused me
to gape quite as much as he probably
was doing

  i have spoken of de ruiz fighting
an imaginary duel and how else was
i to describe it but i saw him
now with head thrown back in agony
his pale face working horribly with
one hand he strove to support him-
self against a table at his side the
other hand was clutched above his
left breast it was upon this other
hand that my gaze was riveted with
horror for as his knees buckled un-
der his weight and he crashed side-
ways upon the table i saw that his
fingers were red with the unmistak-
able stain of the blood that welled
between them

  upon the polished mahogany table
against which de ruiz fell was a
small bottle half filled with fiery
colorless tequila which rocked pre-
cariously upon its bottom at the
crash such is the complexity of the
human mind that it takes remarkable
cognizance of trifles associated with
habit even when focused upon other
and far graver matters therefore
as morales leaped to catch the cap-

tain as he slid from the table to the
floor i quite involuntarily rescued
the half-bottle of tequila to prevent
it spilling and marring the beautiful
surface of the table

the ships medical officer who had
been in the group at my heels
stepped in and helped morales turn
the captain on his back his exami-
nation was very brief he spoke to
the lieutenant and morales sprang
from his knees with his face sternly
set

 someone he snapped at the
wide-eyed officers grouped about the
doorway has taken advantage of
circumstances to assassinate captain
de ruiz in the interval before we fol-
lowed him below senor montalvo
have the kindness to immediately in-
form the guards at the companionway
that none are to pass them until my
further order and bring me men to
conduct a thorough search in the
meantime the rest of you will patrol
the corridor and permit none to
leave or enter go 

  having literally spat out his or-
ders the lieutenant and the doctor
took up the captains body and be-
tween them carried it in and laid it
upon the bunk in the adjoining
stateroom with a vague feeling
that i also should do something and
there being nothing better at hand
i walked over and picked up de
ruizs sword from the floor

  as i stooped to recover it i noticed
a second sword which had escaped
attention because it had been thrown
well under the table or had rolled
there curious i retrieved the
strange weapon and then felt the
hair prickle on the back of my neck
this sensation was not due to the
significant stain upon the point but
wholly to something inherent in the
sword itself it was an ancient ra-
pier and very rusty of a sort in use
a hundred years and more ago


weird tales

  shakily i turned toward the door
impelled by i know not what and
saw or at least i thought i saw a
shadowy figure in the passage that
made a mocking significant gesture
in my direction ere it moved on in
the direction of the stairway

  with the ancient sword in my
hand i leaped into the passage
bringing a sharp challenge from a
guard at the far end the corridor
was absolutely empty except for that
one guard and he sauntering up
assured me when questioned that no
one else had passed

  none the less i felt that i had
surely seen a face that i had seen
before i never could forget those
eyes and i had had a fleeting im-

pression of a wide drooping hat
above it and of a shadowy form
draped in a long weathered sleeve-
less cloak these i remembered also

  i knew then that the rotten sword
in my hand was the same one i had
seen in my dream-the same that
poor de ruiz had seen in his dream
the sword of jean lafitte

  i cast it through an open porthole
and put out my other hand to steady
myself for my knees felt suddenly
and strangely weak it was then i
discovered that i had all along held
tight to the tequila bottle it was a
small bottle and only half full but
tequila is a terribly potent liquid i
didnt care i was glad of it

  i drained the bottle almost at a
gulp

a peculiar little story is this

the swooping
wind

by wilford allen

the gray little old man sitting
so lonely on the rustic bench
under the great oaks interested
me he seemed so out of place there
at first glance yet as one drew close
enough to note the details of his ac-
tion there was a peculiar indescrib-
able something about him which one
learns to recognize about such places
it is always found in certain types
-a rather aimless air of gentle con-
tentment so i sat down beside him
for i knew he wanted to talk

  a very pleasant day sir he be-
gan at once politely

  yes indeed i responded

rather unusual at this time of year
is it not

  not at all sir not at all i ven-
ture to say that the temperature to-
day is about eighty-two degrees not
more than a degree from the normal
at this time and all the meteorolog-
ical conditions wind sky humidity
all are quite normal abnormally nor-
mal sir if i may use the expression
his assertions while quite dogmatic
were belied by the gentleness of his
voice and expression as he spoke

  you are well acquainted with the
weather here i see i put in
rather he smiled i ought to
the swooping wind



be pardon me for speaking without
introducing myself sir i am wil-
liam estrich-dr william estrieh
yes i know you know me now and

you are-

  charles fritwell i supplied

  i am certainly pleased to know
you sir   he assured me and i knew
he spoke the truth  it is a pleasure
to meet someone with whom i can talk
an to an equal these people around
here with a shrug oh they mean
all right but one really cant talk to
them i have to do all my thinking
myself and i really miss the ex-
change of ideas which i should have
tomorrow i start on my greatest
work-but there i mustnt bore you
with that   he finished deprecatingly

  i hastened to assure him that i
should be most happy to hear him
tell of his work but for the time he
had switched off then as suddenly
he began on another tack

  do you know sir there is some-
thing that i must tell you i have
never told anyone before for-well
they always laugh at me i know
that if another told me i should laugh
at him but i know that you will not
laugh so i will tell you

   it is surprizing how little the run
of people caii understand when it is
outside of the little whirl of their
search for the pleasure of the mo-
ment i said i shall be very in-
terested in listening to you

     i knew you would   he was quiet
a minute-several minutes i had
begun to think he had turned off on
still another tangent when suddenly
his whole manner changed and he
turned toward me almost fiercely

  you know me you know me
he repeated huskily i nodded for
since he had introduced himself i
knew him if not before

  yes you know me every edu-
cated person does i am dr
william estrich it is through my
studies that we are able to predict the

movement of storms you were
prescient sir in grasping as you did
without my speaking of it that i am
acquainted with the weather i
should be for i was bom put into
this world for a purpose although i
was a stupidly long time in learning
that fact and that is what i must
tell you

  i was just a child when it hap-
pened the first time too young to
be expected to realize its meaning
for that matter who would have read
the meaning in a single happening

  i shall never forget that day
never we lived in the country
and several of us were on our way
home after school across the fields
crossing the fields was forbidden to
me for a bull of uncertain-perhaps
i should saf of certain-reputation
made that field his stamping ground
but we were going along singing or
talking or playing in the way of chil-
dren and altogether forgetful of dan-
ger i think it was i who saw it first
and it was not fifty yards away dis-
playing all the symptoms of anger
suddenly terrified i screamed and
began to run and the others likewise

  i think i forgot to say i was the
smallest of all and i was soon out-
distanced the fence was still far
ahead and i lost still more ground
by looking over my shoulder contin-
ually it was that which almost was
my undoing for while my gaze was
behind me i stepped into a gopher-
hole and went down with a turned
ankle

  providence had been with me up
till then as the bull for some reason
although obviously angry and pursu-
ing us was not doing so with a great
deal of speed but there i lay un-
able to do anything but crawl along
screaming and the sight seemed to
stir the animal into swifter motion

  then the thing happened until
that time there had not been a cloud
in the sky not a breath of air that i
can recall but at the instant that


weird tales

the bull began purposely to set after
me as i crawled helpless along the
ground there was a sudden roar and
from nowhere there was a sudden
swoop of wind which enveloped the
charging animal in a cloud of whirl-
ing dust in a moment it had gone
and the bull was dashing madly
across the field away from me

  now sudden whirlwinds can de-
velop but naturally they can not
develop in such force with such sud-
denness they must develop they
can not spring into being in full force
without being preceded by the lesser
stages of development

  now that is that and you can
say as i would say that such things
might happen a fortunate coinci-
dence that it happened as it did

  in fact i forgot the occurrence
for years i next recalled it after
the second occurrence which was
even more vivid

  t was past thirty then in fact i

  a had done much of my work and
was on a trip through the high passes
of the andes when it occurred i
was engaged in fact on a meteoro-
logical reconnaissance for my univer-
sity

  we had reached the summit of
the pass and seeing a level-topped
peak of considerable size to the side
i was on the point of turning toward
it ahead of us not more than a
quarter of a mile was a party of
about fifteen men approaching us
my guided seemed a bit worried and
i was on the point of asking them
what was the matter when it hap-
pened

  the sky had been cloudless
though in this case there was a
strong wind blowing through the pass
at our backs with the suddenness
of a clap of thunder i again heard
the roar but where the first time it
had seemed to have only terrifying
force this time it was of destructive

intensity ravening the sky was as
black as though an ash cloud had
passed over the sun and with the
roar the wind swooped down where
we were there was a strong wind
ahead of us we could not see then
but after the wind had subsided as
suddenly and inexplicably as it had
descended and we went ahead to in-
vestigate we could see the effects of
its force now i know i have cal-
culated the strength of the tornadic
winds which in the great plains can
drive a splinter of wood through a
tree trunk it is in the neighborhood
of four hundred miles an hour but
i tell you that wind where it struck
in force at the spot which had been
occupied by the approaching party
did things which no air moving less
than thousands of miles an hour could
do did it and was gone and
there was no trace left of that party

  still the precise similarity did
not show up at once my guides were
terrified and ran and i fearing to
be left there alone went after them
with a gun i was in fact surprized
when they returned so meekly at my
command and still more surprized
at what they told me

  the approaching band were rob-
bers  more they were murderers and
my guides had notified them in the
way they have beyond understand-
ing of sending messages ahead in
those mountains that i was coming
in short it was to be an ambush and
if they had come up to me i should
have been dead within a few mo-
ments the swoop of the tremendous
wind had seemed to my men like the
direct intervention of heaven on my
behalf in fact it was that belief
which brought their confession

  now you will see the similarity
between that occurrence and the
first in each case my life was saved
when in the natural order of events
it should have been lost
the swooping wind



he stopped speaking and i thought
he had finished and started some
remark about it but he interrupted
me and whereas his speech before
had been controlled he now sur-
prized me with a vehemence i did
not look for in the quiet-natured lit-
tle man

  you see now he leaned for-
ward and his face worked convulsive-
ly you see each time to save
me each time it was the wind which
saved me and my life-work was the
study of the wind theie could be
but one conclusion i am to make
great discoveries in meteorological
science and the elements themselves
will protect my life until i have ac-
complished my work it must be a
great work to interest nature herself
to set aside her laws in my favor x
no other man has had that done for
him

  	 that is a most fascinating
thought i put in but he waved me
into quietude as he continued

  but the last time god-there
you will forgive me if i seem to blas-
pheme-if i had my way id damn it
all for the mockery it is but i cant
i cant my god im helpless just
an instrument denied its own life its
own happiness

  soon after that second time of
which i spoke i met a girl you can
guess what happened temporarily
-i told myself it would be only tem-
porarily-rfiy scientific interests were
forced into second place a second
place so far out of mind as to be al-
most nonexistent for i had already
achieved a position in the world i
had already done work which many
could not equal in a lifetime and if
i had found the new interest of a real
love which should drive that other in-
terest from my heart well i could af-
ford to very well

  so we were married and on our
wedding trip went down along the
coast of south america down the

west side intending to return up the
other side but we never reached it

  my god fritwell the tears
stood in his eyes as he turned to me
although his voice did not regeh
fritwell i can never forget that
night and that is the reason that in
all the years since then i have never
been able to concentrate on the work
i must do before i am allowed to die
but tomorrow i think i will manage
to start again

  but that night it was a perfect
evening of the chilean summer and
the soft chords of thrumming spanish
melodies floated over the ship as we
sat about or paraded the decks in-
side of the dancing salon there was
the gleam of eager faces alight with
color and animation as the dancers
swung to the orchestras strains we
had danced and were outside look-
ing over the water with the stars
shining down on us from above and
reflected back at us by the smooth
black water we talked low listening
at the same time to each others voices
and to the waltz-it was sobre las
olas the prettiest piece in the world
when a spanish orchestra plays it
over spanish waters on a summer
evening if there was trouble in the
world we had forgotten it there
was nothing on the boat save joyous-
ness and youth and love

  we were planning they always
plan on their honeymoon if it is the
real thing and we were planning
softly together and i was drinking in
the musical sound of her voice more
wrapt up in it than in the meaning
of her words when it struck

  it struck damn it it struck
and she knew what it meant to do
for as all the world seemed to be
whirling in the one tremendous swoop
of the wind literally tearing the ship
and the sea to pieces and mixing them
until only god himself could tell
which was sea and which was ship i
tried to clutch her to me but she
struggled to break away and through


weird tales

the roar of all the gales that ever
blew concentrated at that one point
in that moment somehow i cant say
how i heard her words let me go
will let me go cant you see-
dont you know-you cant have me
and your work both it has come for
me let me go oh let me go 

 my god she was right right
out of my arms it snatched her and
then all was still again but where
there had been a hundred hearts
throbbing to life and love there was
now only one and it was throbbing to
hate it still does i hate it i hate
it what do i want of life now but
i cant die i am its slave

later i spoke of him in the office
oh estrich yes he is a nice
fellow what he told you is partly
true at least he was a scientist and
the only survivor of a boat which was
lost in a sudden storm with his bride
of a few weeks the rest of it was-
well you could see for yourself he
was quite crazy though harmless

  i did not tell my informant nor
had i told estrich of my experience
in the andes the previous year

  we had come to a point in the pass
where a cloudburst seemed to have
scooped the rock bare of earth and i
noted that my friends crossed them-
selves i remarked on it

  yes senor was the response
but this is the place of the wrath of
heaven

  it must of necessity be then that
there is a legend about this place   i
said expecting to draw out another
of the place-tales one meets with

 my friend who was answering
laughed nervously but for the
once i must decline to tell the legend
for you see i believe it and to your
ears should i tell it it would be un-
believable you would laugh

  do i not know that the tongue of
don pico speaks nothing but truth

i	answered

  that is truth well i take the
chance you saw that the ground
was swept bare completely and per-
haps you think a most terrible storm
of rain caused it you would be
wrong it was the wind senor and
with the dirt it took away twelve men
-puff-and no one ever found a
coat from their backs

  it was fifteen years ago senor
a scientist an american was going
over the pass as are we and his
rascally guides thought to arrange an
ambush with some robbers to share
the loot

  but for once senor heaven in
these degenerate days saw fit to per-
form a miracle like those of the good
book when the meeting was almost
at hand-hand of god it was dark
though there had been no cloud and
a wind sueh as never the andes had
seen came and struck the robbers and
destroyed even the ground they stood
on and-hand of god in the next
moment it was clear and quiet but
the robbers were vanished completely
and the guides were changed men
senor they confessed and were
punished and now they work in tlve
garden of the church at lima doing
the work of god
spectral figures floated threat
ened and mocked

mynheer van rage-
voort did not like the
dark there were things he
could not see in the dark but which
he knew were there but there
were also things that he knew did
not exist which the darkness never-
theless conjured before his eyes
faces spectral figures that floated
and threatened and mocked many
faces many figures and those
of women chiefly and girls of
course they had been witches and
he had condemned them to the tor-
ture to the stake to the rope but
why should they trouble him dance
about him beckon him he had not
executed them he had merely been
their judge the administrator of the
law the law forced him and he
was helpless still they bothered

sometimes they seemed so real   
   w t-

  emphatically mynheer van rage-
voort the justice of hegemonde did
not like the dark worse noises
often came from the night noises
that were mysterious and unaccount-
able sounds like the voices of peo-
ple especially sounds of women in
pain shrieking in torture gasping
brokenly

  there the justice started he
seemed to recognize a voice-yes
he heard it distinctly it sounded

like-ah now he remembered-

the voice of melisande zer honde
a slight girl pale and pretty a child
of scarcely twelve how she had
screamed when the rack drew out
her joints and stretched her muscles
and ripped the ligaments yet she
had confessed he had been amazed
that so young a child should be a
witch but witnesses had stated so

and under the torture she had ad-
mitted it so he was forced to sen-
tence her-to burning at the stake
how she had pleaded for life how
she had shrieked when the flames
enveloped her and then that ap-
palling stillness broken only by the
crackling of fagots and the rush of
the flames

  and there was the sweet innocent
face of gertrudis bourdelaide no
he doubted her accusers he had
known the girl since her birth in
fact he had lifted the child over the
baptismal font as her godfather
terribly she had been accused-
and had confessed they had to
carry her away from the torture he
remembered how her crushed legs
had quivered in agony the white
bloodless features the maimed hands
she had endured much but she had
confessed the rope and quartering
but those moans long-drawn haunt-
ing unending never a shriek never
a cry only moans would he ever
forget

 the justice shook himself he
flung his cloak around his head and
moved down the road carrying in his
hand a small lantern from which a
candle shone weakly not much
good in this thick gloom he mut-
tered there was a fog in the air
which scarcely stirred with his move-
ments yet the stillness the lack of
motion made him feel unsafe rest-
less what was behind the gloom

  hurriedly he trod the road toward
his castle his home this stood some-
what apart from the city as became
the overlord and justice not for
him to live among gossips and small
tradesmen besides it was the home
of his fathers

  a faint rustling sound made him
pause he peered around intently
but perceived nothing even his
candle seemed unable to pierce the
fog beyond his arms reach silence
around him well he must move on
toward home toward rest-perhaps

at least he would see his daughter

  something huge and light fluttered
from the fog and fell over his head
covering him with soft folds in
fright he dropped his lantern and
gurgled a shriek he fought back the
folds but they enveloped him tighter
and tighter drawing around him till
his arms were helpless

  and then hands seized him on the
right and the left and a voice whis-
pered    come but say naught  

 what-what- he began but

an insistent prod of some pointed
weapon made him move forward

forward but where where
were they taking him and for
what purpose the cloth covering
his eyes made little difference he had
been unable to see anything without
it they left the road moved across
ditches over the veldt stops when he
was lifted over some obstacle-a
hedge or boundary mark he thought
more veldt and around him the
faint thuds of numerous feet slither-
ing noises of mantles brushing
against each other muffled clinks of
metal god what was in store for
him

  the justice stumbled through a
ditch then hard and rounded
bumps under his feet-ah he was
back in hegemonde in the city-
among people if he called-

  a sharp point pressed his side and
a warning hiss apprized him of what
would happen so he was silent

  some steps up which he stumbled
then a chamber he felt himself led
to a seat how familiar that seat
felt with his feet he cautiously felt
about himself yes there were the
legs of the table and there his own
footstool it was his own he was in
the court of justice his own court

   y our own court your own
dais   came in deadened tones beside
him we are here to try the witch
of witches to try her under the law
but she must not know us lest sorrow
the witch-baiter



come to all of us so speak not above
a whisper

  routine but why in the night
and who was the woman they called
the witch of witches

  begin the dull command was
given

  routine well he would go
through with it in the name of
the lord on high he intoned in a
penetrating whisper   and in the
name of his majesty the king of
spain and the netherlands there
stands before us a-a-

  a maiden prompted the voice

  -a maiden accused of having

sold her immortal soul to the foul
fiend in unholy conspiracy and of
having exercised her black power in
wanton sorcery and witchcraft to the
detriment of man woman and child
upon their property their goods and
possessions and upon their produce
a pause then woman do you con-
fess

   silence

  who witnesseth against herhe
continued

  we all do witness against her
whispered someone in front of him

  aye aye it is true whis-
pered many voices

  we vow she hath bewitched us or
those of our families and contributed
to our loss even the death of our
loved ones said the accuser

  aye she hath we so vow it
chorused the others

  doth the witch confess asked
mynheer the justice

   silence

  then to the rack with her-till
she confesses

  a scream of terror quickly muffled
a sardonic cackle whose uvular tone
seemed familiar then the shuffle of
many feet

  the justice remained seated no
need for him to enter the torture
chamber besides he would not be
able to see in fact he did not care to

see he had seen too many too
many and they always confessed

  through the open door he heard
the spinning of rolls the weak clatter
of winding drums a hush replete
with indefinite sounds-they were
fastening loops around the ankles and
wrists of the witch then the squeak
of turning handles a pause another
squeak a moan a stifled shriek a
wait then the plash of water an-
other squeak of the drums   

  in accustomed routine the justice
leaned to one side of the great chair
another twist of the rack then would
come the familiar sounds and then-
confession he listened inattentively
for there was a bigger a personal
question what were they intending
to do to him and why this secret
trial if they would only talk in
loud voices and not in those awful
whispers it was unreal-unreal

  again the splash of water then an-
other squeak followed by faint clicks
and tears joints giving way and flesh
ripping a ghastly shriek god
i confess in a pain-shocked voice
a-a-h-h and silence

  yes that was the usual result
sometimes a little slower in coming
but not often there that quiet
cackle he knew it no wonder-
the skilled hands of the executioner
were in charge

  the shuffle of feet once more and
then a voice your worthiness she
hath confessed her guilt your sen-
tence

  mynheer van ragevoort roused
himself sentence very well to
be hanged by the neck until death do
claim her at once this would
be sufficient and few preparations
necessary a rope and-

he must be short he wanted to be
away let them hurry and free him

  for a long time he sat there and
waited-waited silently for around
him all noise had ceased there had
been a little shuffling of men entering


weird tales

the prison enclosure-to see the
witch hung of course-but nothing
more so he sat and pondered he
felt stifled the cloth over his head
impeded his breath and drowsiness
overcame him

the tramp of feet aroused him a
moment later the fetters were re-
moved from his arms and the cloth
lifted from his head and shoulders

  he blinked in the sudden light of
torches before him he saw a number
of hooded figures all with voluminous
cloaks faces hidden behind black
veils were these the same men he
wondered

   so it is here we find you sir jus-
tice said the leader

  mynheer did not recognize the
voice

  we looked for you in the castle
you were not there

  hm so they looked for him
what did it mean why should they
look for him when they had him al-
ready and why no longer the whis-
pers at least he was thankful for
that

  arise sir and take your place
you are to be tried said the leader

  nine men in all noted mynheer
two of them pushed him from the
chair and led him down to a bench
before the dais

   the tall leader at once occupied the
chair of justice

  sir justice note what i say you
have been tried in secret trial and
found guilty we came tonight to
execute sentence we went to your
home and waited for you you did
not come later we searched and
found you absent so at length we
thought to look here and here you
are with sudden humor

  mynheer van ragevoort said noth-
ing only gazed bewildered at the
mummer

  sir justice we are the vehmge-
richt in secret we met and con-
sidered you and the justice meted out

by you sir you have been an un-
just judge you have been a plague
to this land like a wild beast you
have persecuted the innocent and con-
demned them to death nothing has
held you back-not friendship not
pity not justice not even the ties of
blood you lusted only to kill

  he paused and seemed to wait for
an objection mynheer found the
words   they were witches all
they confessed the law gave

  the law scorned the leader in
stinging tones your wild supersti-
tion was the law not the written
law with you an accusation wras
the equal of proof you never gave
fair trial

  they confessed the justice
muttered

  the leader stood up and pointed an
accusing finger at him they con-
fessed-under insane torture they
confessed-to escape further torture
they confessed-what you wished
them to confess confession indeed
so would you confess can an inno-
cent child of ten-for such was ger-
trudis bourdelaide-know anything
of wickedness of sorcery of witch-
craft yet you forced her by the
vilest tortures to say she was guilty
did melisande zer honde know of
witchcraft she confessed to it-
after you tore her on the rack did
roberta deswaarters ever perpetrate
any wickedness-she a patient little
saint wrho spent most of her young
life in pain yet you forced her to
admit unholy practises-by means of
the rack the stocks did margarete
van voelker or pieta der groote-
oh why name them all the dozens of
decent folk you put to death for
years you have sown terror in the
land you have revolted minds with
your unheard-of cruelties you were
the scourge of the people until they
wearied of it

  men came together and in secret
protest asked the veilingericht for
the witch-baiter



justice when the law is in unjust
hands man may-and must-take
the law from those hands and punish
them that is what the vehmgericht
has decided sir justice stand and
hear your sentence

  mynheer van ragevoort arose
stiffly it was all like a dream and
still terribly real for some reason
he could not muster his thoughts to
utter a protest pictures of trials of
tortured women of executions raced
through his mind it was true ter-
ribly true what the leader had sqjfl
but he had not meant to be unjust
he too had suffered because of his
duty he had wanted to rid the land
of the plague of witches he had
wished to make his land free of sor-
cery and witchery for all time to
come many times he had wavered
when friends and even relatives
proved guilty but resolutely with-
out fear or favor he had adminis-
tered the law

  the leader was speaking you
were sentenced to torture and
death he said in somber tones
such was the sentence decided on

  a pause-mynheer twisted his
hands his face suddenly pale and
beaded with cold drops

  again the leader spoke solemnly
impressively and the eyes that
gleamed blackly through the veil held
something of pity torture and
death such was the sentence but
-this sentence will not be carried out
-not completely you shall not die
through our hands-for there is
worse than death that has struck you
perhaps it is the hand of god we
assembled tonight to carry out the
sentence on you but we found that
others had been at work we found
that they had seized you-grief-
stricken fathers they were men fully
as crazed with fear of witches as you
-they had captured the witch of
witches as they thought-had tried
her before your court tortured her

and hung her their vengeance is
gruesome  

  what did it all mean mynheer
van ragevoort seemed paralyzed
his eyes were wide his mouth open
all his features expressed complete
lack of understanding

  you know not continued the
leader who the witch of witches
was nor will i tell you they
blinded you sir justice and blind
was your judgment but a tste ot
the torture shall be yours and then
you will be freed perhaps-perhaps
you will be more forbearing here-
after to work men

qtrong hands seized mynheer van
 ragevoort and quickly stripped
him of his clothes in a trice so
it seemed they bore him to the tor-
ture chamber and looped the ropes
around his wrists and ankles

  a spin of the drums the ropes
tautened and squeaked pain un-
bearable shot through his limbs and
scorched his joints

    another turn   commanded the
leader

  agonized sweat rolled over the jus-
tices body his mouth sagged and a
croak came from his throat i-i
-confess he moaned

     confess   exclaimed the leader in
chill tones confess-what

  the taut body could not even
writhe-could only quiver i-i-
know not   mynheer gasped

     nor we   the leader made a ges-
ture the drums swung back a half-
turn and tightened with a jerk

  suffering indescribable tore into
him-the justice fainted water
splashed over his head awoke him
god now he knew that crazing
agony he had sometimes wondered
why the accused gave in so readily
after a few whirls of the drums he
had been inclined to despise them as
weaklings guilt alone could not en-
dure innocence certainly must but


weird tales

now he knew oh to escape this tor-
ment  anything anything - even
death but to escape

  a searing pain at his sides yet he
knew not whether it was hot or cold
metal that touched him and then
the ropes became slack what they did
with him he scarcely knew-his whole
body ached with tearing pains and
his head it pounded and pounded
and pounded

  a raw pang on his forefinger
seemed to swell and swell until his
arm-no his body-grew large with
the torment what were they doing
he saw it-a pincer was plucking at
a fingernail slowly pulling it from its
foundation god what could he do
to get away from such torture 
waves of pain welled forth from the
finger greater than his body could
endure

  something else they had bound
his wrists behind him his ankles also
were bound and heavy weights at-
tached why this why didnt they
simply kill him and be done with it

  a hook slipped under his fettered
wrists there was a pull and suddenly
he soared his weighted body sus-
spended by the wrists and then he
dropped again they drew him aloft
and dropped him shoulders twisted
and cracked and ached his body
seemed an immense pain he fainted

  a rocking motion aroused him he
was dressed and covered with a cloth
they were carrying him he felt
strangely numb conscious of ever-
present but subdued pain and so
weary so weak so exhausted

  at last the motion changed they
had entered some dwelling and now
they laid him down steps moved
away and then someone spoke-the
leader

  the sentence has been executed
sir justice may it teach you to be
more merciful hereafter we leave
you now-with your victim  

  half-conscious he wondered my
victim he asked his voice muffled
by the enveloping cloth

  look and see in a chilling whis-
per there were quick steps the slam
of a door and then silence

  mynheer van ragevoort scrambled
painfully to his feet weakened hands
tore at the enshrouding folds there
-he saw light-the cloth fell away
but he knew that room-those paint-
ings-that table the chairs-why he
was in his own home so they had
earned him to his house his castle

  he was thankful for even that
but why this strange oppressive si-
lence in the house where were the

servants and his-

  his roving eyes caught sight of
something over there on the great
divan lay something very limp and
still covered with a white drape
that-that-his victim the leader
had said but in this house-was it
-everything was so silent-was it

his- no no it must not be

  he crept weakly to the divan and
tore the sheet from the still figure
  god anne-marie my daughter  
he stared at her unbelieving un-
comprehending his victim oh no
not that not that but it was his
daughter that lay there lifeless fea-
tures frozen in an eternal mask

  slowly he inspected her quiver-
ing fingers felt the soft flesh not yet
rigored in death he saw raw welts
around her wrists and bare ankles
around her neck an irregular strip
-they had hanged her

  his victim it was she-anne-
marie his daughter-that had been
tried as the witch of witches that
night they had tortured her and-
and he-he had ordered the torture
and she confessed he groaned
i-i ordered-her execution-as a
witch god

  the room reeled and he crashed to
the floor
of all wealth abounding in
papua for the man who risks
its myriad perils and keeps
faith with the under-dogs of trade
channels by which pearls and para-
dise skins flow forth captain mc-
teague preferred pearls he was a
connoisseur and could state at sight
and with remarkable accuracy the
natal place of a nest of pearls on
the somewhat sketchy charts of tor-
tiious outlines of the evilly lovely
black sphinx of the south seas he
had painstakingly marked the loca-
tion of more prolific sources of those
translucent drops of tinted glory and
the finest came from a lagoon on the
north coast guarded by an unspoiled
therefore indomitable tribe under the
rule of tukmoo

  in ports which splash the transient
whitewash of civilization on the pa-
puan sea rims it was said that tuk-
moo s warriors had never met defeat
that as sorcerer tukmoo devised
ingenious tortures that were the envy
of his rivals that he it was who
punished infidelity of women by hav-
ing them devour facial features of
their lovers uncooked and sliced from
the living victim who was staked
to the ground and both were sen-
tenced to the dreadful palm death
which takes days of frightful agony
within sight and sound of each other

  captain mcteague did not doubt
the tales told of tukmoo until he en-
quired for pearls from old quong
yick the chinese who got them in
exchange for alarm clocks beads

                                   

torches blazed and burned in a heap lighting the
scene of carnage


weird tales

printed silks and tin dippers and
the old trader cast the first shadow
of suspicion on the hitherto gleam-
ing hellishness of tukmoos intrepid-
ity

   tukmoo no got long time he no
got he ver sick in his liver for why
he no got he say heap debbil-
debbil have got lagoon he make
plenty magic but no can do drive out
debbil me no savvy maybe go
look-see

  when he went north to sarong for
gum-dammar it would not be much
out of his course for captain mc-
teague to investigate for himself the
reason of the dearth of tukmoos
fine pearls mcteague headed his
schooner toward that red mark on his
chart which designated the best pearl
lagoon known from the curlews to
the solomons 

  starting with a sulfur-yellow sky
and dead calm from which the wind
moaned as it arose and lashed the
banda sea to fury a storm drove him
from his course and delayed his ar-
rival with the gray seas still pur-
suing in hump-backed fury mc-
teague saw another craft storm-
harried as his own but making re-
markable speed in the tail of a
typhoon which had kept him on deck
for forty-eight hours she was slen-
der and rakish black as the hells
she came from with lurid storm-red
flashes of light on her pugnacious
brass guns she seemed to be headed
for some harbor until mcteague
hove in sight then she veered about
as if on patrol when he drove in
closer there was a burst of white
smoke a low boom and the scream
of a shot ricochetting too close for
risking a second aim of her gunner
captain mcteague promptly turned
tail cursing his own carelessness in
not learning more about the debbil-
debbils which put fear into the heart
of the dauntless and devilish tukmoo
that grim streak of a craft fast swal-
lowed by coast shadow was manned

by oily mascats head-hunting dyaks
and god alone knew what mixture
of human wolves but any and all of
them merely spineless innocents com-
pared with their master who had
made his own name the terror of the
banda

  mcteague knew as much as any
other man about po sung he was
a mongolian tainted by the worst of
other strains of heritage he spoke
excellent english was suave in com-
pany of europeans and had so huge
a grasp of trade that he was a valued
confidant of port merchants and dip-
lomats for some years while he per-
fected his own sovereignty in hidden
realms of wealth po sung was like
a giant octopus with tentacles reach-
ing to every compass point now
that he was growing old he had
brazenly disdained the guise of de-
cency and took his true colors secure
from vengeance in some backwater
shelter where he devised and executed
his schemes unmolested captain
mcteague wished he had not run
across po sung

  he would have headed out and
away only the storm had strained his
schooner an  snapped off a few spars
and he needed to seek shelter and
make repairs especially as the ba-
rometer which rose promisingly had
suffered a relapse presaging a flash-
back of storm

  at sunset luridly furious behind
the crouching black spine of papuan
hills he headed the schooner into a
lagoon and dropped anchor and was
not surprized to be wakened shortly
after he turned in by drums of the
jungle talking in purring spurts and
long tattoo rolls his arrival was be-
ing broadcast by black men in the
same manner in which their forebears
had communicated news of the
epochal upheavals of world inunda-
tion the sunken lemuria and atlan-
tis the night was pregnant with
menacing growl of drums and a
grimmer dawn poured opalescent
the devils of po sung



light over a lagoon alert with darting
canoes slender as arrows heralding
the arrival of the sorcerer tukmoo

as the sorcerers canoe shot along-
side the schooner mcteague saw
that tukmoo wore a necklace of
pearls large as his finger ends strung
between human incisor teeth he
was plumed and painted covered
from forehead to heel with blue lace
of tattooing beaded with cicatrices a
scarlet loin-cloth supported a club
knobbed with human knuckle-bones
the forty paddles stabbed the water
as one and mcteague was wondering
since there are but two in a set how
many incisor teeth went into that
necklace when tukmoo reached the
deck and planting his prehensile-toed
feet firmly demanded in fairly fluent
pidgin-english strong drink

  mcteague obliged with watered
brandy further weakened by grena-
dine sirup with a chaser of coffee
he had blundered into a lagoon
usurped by tukmoo when he was
driven from his heritage by po sung
he regretted the cruise and again
wished himself far away

  o chief i must make repairs to
my boat he stated how come
you  longer guard the pearl lagoon
to the south

  tukmoo spoke wily words of wis-
dom he had the advantage of
acquaintance during youth and young
manhood with a zealous missionary
and at the good mans death from old
age had absorbed according to his
belief wisdom of his heart which
tukmoo ate roasted he related a
cause for deserting his pearl lagoon
which was difficult to translate into
pidgin captain mcteague short-
ened the tale for his swede mate
okey when he announced that he
would go ashore with tukmoo

  okey po sung has got the pearl
lagoon hes loosed a few extra fine
devils and scared the giblets out of

tukmoo i dont understand the de-
tails but po sung has a flock of red
devils on the river they sound like
man-eaters whether bird or beast i
cant make out the muggers speak
words the apes chin-chin in native
lingo the land is bewitched i
suspected a phonograph but tukmoo
has one he got from quong yick and
knows better his son sailed in to
lick hell out of po sung and turned
up missing just when he was ready
to marry a girl all nicely ripened
in the bleaching-huts tukmoo is
ready to make bigger magic by tor-
turing this girl only we happened
along in time to fall into the mess
and i wish to god that typhoon had
piled us on the curlews before we
ran in here tukmoo demands that
i go and make magic that will drive
out po sung since his own monkey-
tricks have failed theres no choice
about it okey ive got to go or
theyll make potpourri and irish
stew of you and me and the crew
get me my box of parlor tricks and
bengal lights and pack in a dozen
sticks of dynamite with fuses and
caps if you hear me fire two shots
twice in succession be ready to grab
me and run for deep water if i
dont come back the schooner is
yours okey

  you ban damn fool to go com-
mented okey but already captain
mcteague felt the thrill of high ad-
venture beating his blood to foam
as the drums in canoes spoke to drums
on shore of events going forward

the stilt-legged huts of a com-
paratively new village were
fresh-thatched and clean women
stirred cooking-pots over beach fires
beside captain mcteague swaggered
a black boy tao carrying the box of
parlor magic over which he was ap-
pointed guard it was the first time
captain mcteague had been in league
with black men or broken his wisdom


weird tales

of neutrality in thirty years of trad-
ing he assumed an arrogance he did
not feel as he sat at the feast of roast
sea-turtle scraped coconut cream and
stewed fish washed down with fer-
mented palm-juice strolling about
the village afterward he saw the be-
reaved mother of tukmoos lost son
tawa her body painted in white
stripes her hair matted with filth in
token of mourning grief he also
saw old women guarding the bleach-
ing-hut and caught a glimpse of the
bride who stuck out her head and
gazed for a long minute at this white
man who came to fight po sungs
debbil-debbils and avenge her lost
lover she was pretty as a doll with
hair like a curly feather duster and
skin bleached to creamy copper to
mcteague she called a greeting
halloo tuan

  tukmoos rage was sudden he
yelped a command and the girls
shrieks shrilled through the village
with the sound of a whip

  are you having that child beat-
en he demanded of tukmoo

  not enough to injure her comeli-
ness because if she is not killed for
a debbil feast i will sell her to a big-
bellied chinese trader explained
tukmoo

  mcteague knew the folly of inter-
ference yet he hated the sound of
the whipping and played a bold
game for a man in the power of sav-
ages whose aspect could change from
friendliness to yelps of blood-lust in
the twinkling of an eye

  you are wrong to punish the wo-
man just now le said she will
prove a help to our magic if she is
told she will be taken with us so that
her liver hot with love for your son
tawa will smell out the place where
ho is kept prisoner

  tukmoo was impressed by this
reasoning and yelped a rescinding
command the shrieks of the girl
changed to quiet sobbing the whip-
wielder leaped from the hut and the

girl was flung sobbing hysterically to
the doorway where she looked down
on mcteague with tear-streaked face
and eyes like brimming golden pools
he wondered if her evident adoration
of him as her deliverer might be
turned to account in getting himself
out of a perilous predicament

tukmoo commanded aday of feast-
ing by night the lagi-lagi house
held sodden harvest of drunken and
overstuffed warriors and tukmoo
slept with his head on the stomach of
his oldest wife mcteague who dined
and drank sparingly prowled through
the deserted village and halted beside
the bleaching-hut where a rift of
moonlight splintered by palm sabers
twinkled on the face of the girl at the
door near by drowsed the young
tao with mcteagues box between his
legs

  in a long day of scheming and
planning escape by the river mc-
teague saw his first chance of suc-
cess laying a finger on his lips for
silence he beckoned the girl down
the notched log from the hut and
touched the sleepy tao who started
snatched up the box and stood ready
to accompany the white sorcerer

  mcteague pointed to the river and a
canoe hauled on shore it was slipped
soundlessly to the water and the
three took their places with the girl
in the prow mcteague understood
the awe of his magic box which made
them obey unquestioningly tukmoo
ruled by fear of his cruelties and the
white sorcerer was greater than tuk-
moo in the face of that appraisal of
his powers mcteague did not dare
command tao to head for the lagoon
and schooner he was compelled to
make some sort of farce of laying po
sungs devils for a cry from tao
would arouse the village and turn the
moon-silvered peace to red slaughter
he saw regretfully that tao headed
the canoe inland  the black water-
way
the devils of po sung



  they had not gone a half-mile when
in the din of droning humming
clacking insects came a sound which
made the girl gasp with fear and held
taos paddle dripping as he paused
to listen it was like a voice speaking
through a muffled rasping mega-
phone mcteagues skin was prick-
ling as he distinguished words dis-
connected and maudlin as if a
drunken sailor mouthed a booming
sea-chantey

     blo-ow  ma-an do-o-own o-oh
blo-ow tha ma-an do-own it was
repeated and followed by obscene
curses

  walk-about land tuan whis-
pered the girl who crouched at mc-
teague s feet

  a white man in the jungle he
stated with conviction

   debbil-debbil  came a low mut-
ter from tao

  mcteague watched the river for a
canoe moon-silver frail as a spiders
spinning crinkled on the black flow
which upheaved the long head of
a crocodile lifted and it seemed to
mcteague that from its wicked jaws
came a water-smothered repetition of
blo-ow the man do-own then it
sank and bubbles broke the canoe
shot forward under frenzied pad-
dling and in its wake the mugger
again lifted his snout and gaping
jaws

  da-amn po su-ung came a hol-
low growl answered by a cackle of
raucous laughter from the jungle
which made mcteague snatch the re-
volver at his hip

  orang-outang he said as a tree
branch released from the clutch of
the mighty gray man of the woods
crashed again came that outcry of
terrible mirth and he saw the gray
shape a lighter shadow in the gloom
where the moonlight quivered through
shaken palms

  the joke is on you red moor-
phy   came a deep-chested growl
ye hated wather it took po sung

to make ye loike ut why dont ye
find pearls verself pearls hell
they got us in this mess made a mug-
ger o you an a monkey o me

 red murphy mcteague knew
that name it belonged to a drunken
loafer and thief who had served time
for killing a chink trader in pearls
but he could not credit his senses as
he heard a jungle voice attribute the
personality of a river mugger to red
murphy

  the canoe leaped like an arrow
down the stream but the gray man
of the woods kept pace and the croco-
dile followed a patch of shelving
shore denuded of vegetation gave off
a sickening stench mcteague was
thankful the walk-about ground was
temporarily deserted of saurians at
his feet the girl quivered and her
teeth chattered his hair rose in
contagion of fear as the moonlight
entered a leas dense patch of jungle
vines where the big ape swung by one
foot peering at the river again arose
that soul-shattering human laughter
ringing through the night

  wan more white fool came the
guttural cry go on you bloody
idiot po sung take yer brain an
sell yer dried head an feed yer car-
cass to his orchids like he did to
red moorphy an me god god
 like he did to us fer wantin a few
pearls

  a scream from the girl contracted
mcteagues nerve skeins from be-
hind the leathery throat of the sau-
rian moaned a booming meat-
whi-ite me-eat ee-at dr-rink an
be-ee merry

  lave em alo-one growled the
ape ill have company when po
sung gits em dont fill yer leather
belly wid white ma-an here have a
nut there was a thud as the hairy
gray arm swung and a coconut hit
the muggers jaws which snapped
shut then it lunged on shore the
crooked-fanged jaws snapping in vain
at the ape which swung just out of


weird tales

reach and shrilled curses as it pelted
the armor-clad mugger with coconuts

  mcteague stared he pinched his
own flesh to make sure he was awake
glancing at tao he saw sweat pouring
down the oiled black chest of the na-
tive and the gleam of his eye-whites
as he strained every muscle to out-
distance the river horror

  through the overhung river chan-
nel resounded the crash of water
beaten by the powerful tail of the
crocodile its booming curses of port
dive origin the thuds of coconuts
on its scaly length the horrid shrieks
of the apes mirth as it denuded palms
of their nuts the river bobbed with
them the roar and scream of the
combat was like thunder silencing
the rasp of insect clatter and hard
breathing of tao mcteague thought
he should soon awake from this in-
credible nightmare he assured him-
self it was the ravings of delirium
but the finger-nails of the girl cut his
flesh as she clutched his legs in her
terror

catchum white-man chin-chin
she quivered make magic tuan

  the river turned the walls of
matted lianas shut the sound of com-
bat farther away then only did tao
slacken speed

  debbil-debbils he groaned
mcteague thought of the feeble
frauds of parlor magic in the box
shoved toward him by the girl simple
tricks he had brought to fight such
magic as he never dreamed-dread
incomprehensible black magic had
po sung trained an ape to speak a
crocodile to talk he could think of
no other explanation yet that mock-
ery was dissipated when he recalled
the words of the ape and its reason-
ing this was no parrotlike repeti-
tion of words nor would po sung be
likely to teach jungle beasts english
curses the terrible mongolian had
invented a new hell into which mc-
teague plunged and in that hour his
only resolve was to sell life dearly

but to die rather than fall into the
power of that arch-fiend

 the swish of branches near by
roused him in the waning moonlight
of the hour before dawn he saw a
second gray shape swinging along
and slowly whimpering inarticulate
sounds resembling native lingo the
girl stiffened as she knelt her hands
clutched her round breasts and her
cry aroused mcteagues pity

  tawa she moaned tawa chin-
chin    talk-talkee

  mcteague felt his hair prickling
his scalp the canoe drifted as tao
was frozen by fear there was the
drip-drip of the paddle held in air

    tawa tawa   called the girl the
ape ceased muttering then clutched a
mat of lianas and swung closer peer-
ing down at the face of the girl now
gray-yellow in the frame of bushy
curls there came a scream that
curdled mcteagues blood the hairy
arm shot out and caught the girls
hair and she was lifted from the ca-
noe to twist slowly and struggle feebly
until mcteagues gun cracked came
a howl of pain as the hold was re-
leased the girl slumped in the canoe
and the ape streaked into the jungle
the canoe leaped forward

  mcteague let the girl lie in merci-
ful oblivion his own blood congealed
at the horror of this demon-haunted
domain of po sung behind them
came the fighting mugger and first
ape and they dared not attempt to
turn back

gray dawn sifted over moon and
stars through densely matted
lianas mcteague saw patches of pearl-
tinted sky and caught lurid gleams
of scarlet flowers which breathed a
fetid scent as repulsive as the walk-
about grounds of crocodiles the
shore was a mass of orchids with
black throats and quivering stamens
of yellow which climbed the branches
of gray trees and dead ropes of vines
a bend in the river hid them from the
the devils of po sung



ape and mugger the eanoe navi-
gated a stretch of stream walled by
the furious scarlet of orchids that
seemed to announce the master-hand
of a gardener planting them like
ruddy cliffs along the black flow of
river shadow

  when the sun spread gold on the
upper reaches of the flower wall mc-
teague observed the orchid petals
quivering and folding in elongated
bulb-shapes of dull yellow the river
widened into a pool smooth as a mir-
ror bordered with fern and feathery
nipa palm there was lurid and om-
inous beauty in the place a menacing
and maddening tumult of scarlet or-
chids of gigantic size with petals five
feet or more in length their dusky
black throats shading to maroon pur-
ple the stamens stood out like
knobbed wands thick as a mans
thumb the stench was breath-taking
overpowering disgusting yet when he
commanded tao to land he met vigor-
ous protest

    catchum die   chattered tao he
dropped the paddle to scoop water in
his palms and suck at it noisily mc-
teague snatched the paddle and sent
the canoe shoreward its prow shoved
aside the ferns and he thrust a foot
to test the pool rim for a landing foot-
hold balancing his body with arms
outthrust instantly the nearest giant
flowers lunged forward and he was
shocked to helplessness as the great
petals wrapped about his bare arm
with the cold sensation of serpent
scales yet repulsively flexible and
soft

  paralyzed from amazement he felt
himself pulled from the canoe to
flounder breast-high in the pool the
petal grip on his arm tenaciously
supporting his weight his arm pained
as if constricted by a tourniquet
taos screech roused the girl who
first recovered her wits and snatched
a knife from taos belt mcteague
was trying in vain to tear off the or-
chid petal his senses reeled from

the anesthetic stench of the orchid
throat and he was only vaguely aware
that the girl slashed loose gray sec-
tions of petals the veins of which took
strength to sever he slumped into
the pool over his head and came up
to clutch at the canoe stern over which
he was hauled

  tearing the petal fragments from
his arm he felt the stab of pain and
blood spurted from the pores of a
swelling red band mcteague was
horrified with fear of virulent poison
he jabbed his knife into the flesh
and sucked vigorously spitting into
the pool as tao sent the craft from
shore

  as the canoe drifted near shore mc-
teague saw the orchids move forward
on their stems like gorgeous beast-
heads craning toward a glut of meat
the whole wall was alert and in mo-
tion lunging out waving giant
flowers to and fro until he could see
the supporting jungle trees dead and
bleached to the tops he knew the
vampire orchids of the jungle but
never before had he seen such huge
ones or animal greed so voraciously
displayed adding to horror the pool
narrowed again to river width arched
overhead by the terrible scarlet flow-
ers it was like the red throat of a
medieval dragon yawning for victims

 mcteague turned from the sight
and observed a singular phenomenon
at the pool as the sun rose and its
hot light gilded the topmost flowers
their petals jerked reluctantly shut
folded into bulb-shaped buds at
his command the paddle halted they
waited until sunlight flooded the pool
and the shore was hung with leathery
yellow bulbs the shaded river
yielded more slowly to the all-power-
ful sun the canoe went on and as
if sentient aware of meat near by
the tips of petals unfolded like tigers
tongues there was the sound of
creaking and rubber stems writhing
like serpents the sun had worked
one of its myriad miracles but it did


weird tales

not penetrate into the scarlet funnel
more than a hundred yards where
mcteague faced low-hanging scarlet
horrors that swayed forward greedy
for prey

  again the craft was halted and mc-
teague reached for his box then
busied himself biting caps and fuses
on sticks of dynamite his right arm
was swollen to twice its natural size
and almost useless his lips were hot
and dry as in fever the flower stench
was terrific and making them all
drowsy

  yelling to tao to back the canoe
he tossed a stick of dynamite at each
river shore and they were drifting
on the pool when a deafening roar
crashed there were tearing and
slithering sounds the river roof
seemed to lift and a backwash of
water rocked their craft

  for some moments debris rained
down brilliant bunches of feathers
that had been paradise birds and
lories ragged tatters of orchid pet-
als nooses of lianas then the scarlet
wall seemed to subside and float on
the water surface a bridge of vege-
tation over which mcteague assisted
tao to shove the canoe into sun-
drenched water beyond

  to his incredible relief mcteague
breathed cleaner air than the stinking
fetidity of the orchid pool there
was clean salt breeze from the sea
and tang of ebb-tide which cleared
his brain of the poison that stultified
his senses- but they faced peril ahead
for as the river turned he saw the tip-
tilted cornices of a dwelling built like
an old temple of cathay and knew
they approached the house of po
sung

  much as he dreaded a meeting with
that terrific personage there was no
choice he hoped his wits and ob-
vious blundering into the place would
prove his innocence of intent to thieve
pearls he was too well-known to
drop out of sight without enquiry
and trouble for any man who held

him prisoner all in all even po
sung was a more endurable alter-
native than a return by the river
yet his nerves tautened as he saw
cultivated gardens and a long per-
golalike bridge spanning the river
completely covered at the far end with
the scarlet orchids folded now in yel-
low buds

  small channels had been cut from
the river and one of these they fol-
lowed to a small pool red lacquer
bridges arched the little streams the
sea-tang was stronger there were
hedges of fragrant ylang-ylang and
frangipani glimpses of orchards and
growing plants in prim array white
crushed-coral paths coolies in wide
hats moving about stone steps of
a landing-place which caught mc-
teagues breath and gaze

a tall form in a robe of saffron
yellow awaited them its hands
folded in green-banded sleeves cap-
tain mcteague looked into the grim
black eyes of po sung

  welcome he spoke in suspi-
ciously bland tones i do not often
have visitors captain mcteague
his eyes darted like black quick-
silver from mcteagues head down
his bleeding arm to his river-wet
trousers and boots

    i heard your salute my ser-
vants came running to report a breach
in my orchid wall i did not expect
you to dynamite a way to my poor
house captain mcteague why not
have come by the sea

  no doubt you know the reason
po sung your boat took a pot-shot
at my schooner yesterday i had no
idea of visiting you but when i put in
to make repairs tukmoo decided to
detain me ive had a bad night
trying to get away and got a caress
from your loving orchids could i
trouble you for some permanganate   
my poor house is at your disposal
captain mcteague  

  he followed po sung up the path
the devils of po sung



with the girl close at his heels tao
was sent to white-washed huts of
coolie workers on the porch of the
house copper-screened and shaded
mcteague fell into a sea-grass chair
and snatched at the tall glass of cool
liquid brought by a dyak servant
he was exhausted and his eyes closed

  when he wakened he was lying on
a soft mattress clad in silk pajamas
and his wounded arm was wrapped
with gauze light from a horn-sided
ceiling lantern showed him a sleep-
ing-room with no other furnishings
than his bed and a blue jar of scent-
less hibiscus along one wall he was
troubled by far-away moanings and
yowls from the jungle as if the great
gray men of the woods howled their
hate of po sung

  then again he slept and awoke
greatly refreshed the dyak boy
brought a tray of food highly spiced
chicken curry fruit and rice wine
evidently po sung lived in luxury in
his hidden haven mcteague de-
cided that the tales told of the mon-
golian were too luridly flavored by
superstition a devil he might be
but he had extended gentlemanly hos-
pitality to captain mcteague

  the dyak boy shaved mcteague and
trimmed his bronze beard he was
shown a coral-lined swimming-pool
where he bathed and donned pajamas
of heavier silk and thick-soled san-
dals returning to the porch where
po sung sat waving a womanish fan
of carved ivory and kingfisher
feathers

  you slept well captain mc-
teague he enquired

  splendidly thanks to you po
sung

  i am honored i feared your rest
would be disturbed the big apes
were noisy and my servants worked
with torches in the garden however
i am free today to entertain you no
doubt you came for pearls

  he clapped his hands and the dyak
boy appeared with a lacquer box and

placed it on mcteagues lap then
opened the lid mcteague gazed on
such magnificence of pearls as he had
never seen ran his fingers in their
glory poured them from palm to
palm then realizing that his eyes too
much reflected the greed he felt of
such wealth he resolutely snapped
down the lid and motioned the boy to
take them away

    the sight of them makes me want
them of course but i only trade in
pearls and so far only through quong
yick who told me that tukmoo no
longer held this lagoon i came to
learn why he let it go and i fell into
his clutches he took me prisoner
and demanded powerful magic to
fight your debbil-debbils i brought
my parlor tricks and dynamite what
else could i do tukmoo had me
where he could force me to do his
bidding then he had a big feast
and while he was drunk and asleep
i came away with tao the black boy
and the girl who was to have been the
wife of tawa son of tukmoo we
were pretty badly scared at the apes
and muggers on the way here and
drifted into the orchid lagoon i
blasted my way through  

  po sung caressed the silky black
mustache which dripped like tar-
streams from his upper lip

   tukmoos son is braver than the
sorcerer iadmire such courage in
youth and have made him indepen-
dent of the blacks who are stupid
pigs but it is a pity to separate two
lovers so i was pleased when you
brought the girl they shall be
united  

  thats mighty decent of you po
sung said mcteague impulsively
then as he saw the basilisk gaze of
those black eyes and the sneering smile
of the cruel lips his heart missed a
beat you mean what you have
just said he faltered

  i speak the truth captain mc-
teague in a few days you shall see
for yourself meanwhile i should like


weird tales

to show you some of the magic i have
worked here and the growth of an
orchid bulb planted only last night
come  

  mcteague followed him toward the
pergola arching the river it was
still in shadow and the scarlet orchids
wido open at the jungle end at the
near approach thick green stems
thrust rosy tips from soft loose earth
po sungs yellow hand pointed and
mcteague saw the stems stretch
higher growing inches as he watched
putting forth buds and twisting
through the bars of the trellis

  marvelous po sung you are
another burbank  

  again i am honored by your
praise the wild orchid devoured
only insects and birds but under my
gardening it is perfected to a man-
eating flower fed by blood it is a
hungry thing captain mcteague
and only for the foolish assaults of
tukmoos warriors the river walls
would not have flourished as they do
i planted those bulbs in human car-
casses as this one was planted last
night  

  mcteagues body jerked his head
came up slowly until he gazed into
the terrible eyes of po sung

  you planted a bulb in a human
body last night

  po sung nodded

  did i not say that i have de-
cided to unite tawa and his bride
tawa is now in the jungle i heard
him chattering to you as you came
up the river i hope your shot did
not maim him tawas body feeds
this full-grown orchid across the
bridge his brain is in the head of
a gray man of the woods

  god in heaven breathed mc-
teague you mock me with lies
po sung smiled his black eye-
brows arched

  you shall see and believe you
are not the first man to doubt the
power of po sung one year ago
two thieves stole in from the sea one

of them supplied brains to a river
crocodile the other is a gray ape
they were companions in crime but
always fighting they still fight along
the river shore a most amusing sight
as you must have found it last night  
mcteague felt the tropic heat chok-
ing him yet cold sweat rained down
his face he stumbled over the coral
paths as he followed po sung to the
house and through doorways he
scarcely saw with the smell of chloro-
form growing stronger until he stood
in a room with white cement walls a
skylight overhead fitted like a hos-
pital operating-room under the open
skylight was a huge iron-legged cot
to which the body of a she-ape was
strapped its head swathed in ban-
dages two chinese were clearing
away the evidences of surgery and
one of them spoke to po sung in ac-
centless english

  she is doing splendidly

  the bride of tawa announced
po sung pointing to the ape my
assistant dr feng chu

 mcteague heard no more the
floor seemed to heave and bludgeon
him he had fainted

for time of which he had no means
of keeping track mcteague lay
on a porch couch wtaited on hand and
foot by the dyak boy po sung and
dr feng chu he learned from the
assistant surgeon were away in the
yacht po sung left orders to show
captain mcteague every respect and
tell him the casket of pearls was a
gift it was advisable not to attempt
to return to his schooner until po
sungs arrival the gray apes were
troublesome lately

  they troubled mcteague at night
he heard the raucous mirth and
mournful calling of tawa and saw
the ghoulish man-shapes in the star-
light the she-ape in the surgery
was also noisy moaning piteously
and mouthing queer sounds quite dif-
ferent from ape-chatter
the devils of po sung



   it seemed to mcteague he was still
in feverish delirium he did not want
to escape had no power to attempt
it there were books but he would
not exert himself to read wander-
ing about the grounds he noticed the
new orchid had attained a prodigious
size and was already beginning to
bloom mingled with his waking
dreams were thoughts of two vampire
orchids rooted in the moldering flesh
of tawa and the girl and their brains
in the heads of jungle simians

  there came a day when the as-
sistant surgeon led the she-ape to the
grounds and chained her to a tree
where she squatted as inert as mc-
teague on the porch he wondered at
her limpness until the chinese told
him she was under opiates to keep her
quiet while her head healed then
it flashed to the mind of mcteague
that like the ape he was being doped
no other explanation accounted for
his spineless indifference to his fate
a healthy fear intruded on his half
dreams he was being held for some
sinister purpose of po sung and like
a fool he had supinely endured

  where is po sung he asked
the chinese

  you have heard of a remarkable
trained ape belonging to a scientist in
java perhaps po sung hopes to
bring it back and turn it into this
jungle as a companion for tawa and
the other experiment on the pearl
thief mcmahon

  i have seen pet monkeys freed
among their own kind said mc-
teague slowly the wild monkeys
kill them instantly

  the chinese did not answer for
the she-ape had roused and was leap-
ing to the length of her chains the
tree shook with her vigorous attempts
to free herself

  now she shall have her lesson to
avoid the house when she is at lib-
erty said the chinese he went
into the house and appeared again
with a whip of long thin lashes barbed

with metal watching his chance he
swung it at the she-ape mcteague
hated the cruelty of that performance
the furious suffering beast with her
blood-red eyes the streaks of blood
spurting from her flanks and the cold-
blooded chinese lashing with all his
strength his own blood boiled raced
lashed him to fury that combated the
dope he was now certain had been fed
him in the spicy curries at mealtimes

  when the ape sank down quivering
and exhausted the coolies rushed for-
ward and unshackled her and again
the lash sang through the air and
lifted tufts of skin with a bound
she was up and staggering uncertain-
ly away to disappear over the bridge
into the jungle the chinese coiled
his whip and returned to the house

  that day mcteague scraped his
food into a towel and hid it under
his mattress then wandered to the
gardens and ate fruit already he felt
lighter freer but his nerves ached for
the sedative he realized a new peril
a craving for opium fed him that
would be worse than slavery unless
he escaped at once but he did not
know how closely his movements were
guarded

   he returned to the porch the as-
sistant surgeon was talking to a coolie
whom he dismissed he asked mc-
teague to come with him to the sur-
gery where he filled a hypodermic
needle then laid yellow fingers on
the white mans arm 

  no yoix dont exploded mc-
teague youve doped me long
enough po sung wont use my car-
cass for his devil-orchids unless he
kills my brain first his fist shot
out caught the point of the yellow
jaw and with a screech the chinese
doubled up on the floor mcteague
heard running feet and slammed shut
the metal door of the surgery just
as yellow men lunged into view the
bolt rang home he had barricaded
himself in the cement-walled room
with the xmconscious yellow man


weird tales

jcon a few moments lie felt a huge

  satisfaction but it passed as the
chinese stirred he hauled him to the
cot and strapped him with bonds that
had held the she-ape then he
mopped his sweaty face and consid-
ered from the open skylight he heard
sounds of some alarm the yellow
men had thundered on the door then
departed using a small ladder he
climbed to the roof opening and
looked from the tiers of roofs down on
the domain of po sung the sunset
colors on the gleaming lagoon and sea
and he saw there the rakish black
yacht whose guns had fired on his
schooner po sung had returned

  news of his return agitated the
servants who darted to and fro with
flaring torches then mcteague saw
the cause of their excitement on the
orchid-twined bridge two gray shapes
swung and the closed flower bulbs
bobbed like elongated balloons on
strings the river water was stirred
by a lashing black tail and in
the rapidly gathering night gloom
sounded the booming curses of devils
which po sung had created roused
now to fun against the arch-fiend

  a fierce unholy joy filled the breast
of captain mcteague below him
the yellow surgeon heaved against
the binding thongs of the cot a
dancing light low down on the lagoon
told of po slings small boat leaving
the yacht he would enter the wa-
terway and meet the rage of his vic-
tims and from his high perch mc-
teague could defy them all po sung
the mugger and the apes

  no not all for a third wavering
gray ape came over the bridge fangs
bared in a horrid grin frightening
the torch-bearers back to the house as
she advanced in the smoky light
mcteague could see the raw-edged
scar about her head which bandages
had hidden that day her screams
were piercing and pitiful her scram-
bling weak and uncertain but she was
fearless for behind her stalked the

man-apes tremendously powerful
long arms swinging to their feet and
before that terrible sight the coolies
retreated with wild screeches slam-
ming doors moving furniture against
all openings

  up the river bank crawled a glis-
tening black length of scaled ugliness
with jaws snapping

  mcteague heard the sound of rip-
ping and tearing the furious scream
of the simians then blood-curdling
cries he saw a glare below where
the she-ape tossed torches in a heap
to blaze and burn lighting the scene
of carnage he saw human forms
broken and twisted hurled from the
porch and strips of bamboo walls
tossed  the fire then he knew his
own peril sooner or later the apes
would slaughter every living thing
tear the house to shreds and break
into this surgery he looked down
at the bound yellow man on the cot
this was  time for petty differ-
ences

  the jungle apes are killing the
servants he cried and burning
the house we are trapped up here
and po sung is on his way by the
river to meet a doom he deserves
ill confess im a coward right at this
minute i prefer a shot to that death
is there a gun within reach   

  he dropped down and unfastened
the bonds then pointed to the ladder
which the chinese mounted even
climbing out on the roof to look over
its edge

  mcteague heard him cry out a
despairing shriek of terror he
leaped up the ladder in time to see a
gray shape squatted on the roof dan-
gling the miserable surgeon by one
arm and swinging him back and
forth suddenly her hold broke the
chinese twisted in the air and fell to
the ground quivered and then lay
still

  mcteague looked into the gleaming
red eyes of the she-ape he had no
weapon but below were cases of sur-
the devils of po sung



gieal knives his only defense now
his only chance of suicide to escape
worse he dropped from the sky-
light and his fist crashed into the
glass of a case his fingers fumbled in
the darkness among queer contriv-
ances but none of them knives he
dashed to another case guided by the
faint luminosity of glass and crashed
through it then the faint starlight
and fire reflection were blotted out
the skylight held the she-ape and she
had dropped inside and sat on the
ladder peering at him he could see
her gleaming eyes hear his own
breath sobbing in his throat as his
hands fumbled for knives and found
only small probes useless to fight
that huge gray death

  he was flattened against the wall
beside the ease a fistful of sharp
probes ready for the lunge when he
heard her muttering in piteous ef-
forts to control the vocal mechanism
of the thick throat

  tuan she muttered tuan
and swung down from the ladder with
an arm outstretched he felt the
claws touch his arm gently and
stroke his flesh

then for mcteague blackness fell
he was vaguely aware of being
swung in giant arms andfeeling a cool
wind in his face his eyes opened he
lay on the upper roof with the arm of
the she-ape holding him firmly be-
low the fire leaped and the sounds of
savage destruction went on but there
were no cries of fear now only the
guttural curses of the ape mcmahon
and war-cries of papuan jungle ut-
tered by tawa turning his head
mcteague saw the light on the yachts
dingey coming down the river

  look he muttered and his arm
pointed the she-ape turned

  she saw and understood in an-
other moment mcteague was seized
bodily and swung in air as the she-
ape swiftly descended by the tiers of

pointed roofs until he was dropped
unhurt on the earth seizing him by
one wrist she ran with him toward
the river where black gloom of trees
hid them effectively there mcteague
still held by his captor saw the dark
swirl of water where the mugger
dived he saw the boat sweep on
under the dip of oars to its doom

  there was an unheaved bow lan-
tern cries in the night and the lash-
ing of the muggers tail the snap-
ping of its terrible jaws and sea-oaths
from its dread throat later a limp
dripping figure crawled to the bank
mcteague could hear its gasping
breathing and the she-ape leaped for-
ward he was free

  he waited until the she-ape seized
that creeping victim escaped from the
mugger and her cry summoned the
man-apes  one of whom carried a
brand of flaming wood its light
shone on the yellow face of po sung
distorted now by terror he had so
often chiseled on faces of other men
mcteague saw the she-ape clutch the
long ends of his mustache curl them
about her claws and drag po sung
by his mouth toward the pergola

  then he turned away at the dread-
ful cry that broke the three apes
were tearing po sung to bits and
stuffing them into the orchid bulbs

  on the river the dingey floated
mcteague darted toward it plunged
in dragged it to the shallows and se-
cured a floating oar he glanced back
at the river bend and saw the apes
tinging bits to the gaping jaws of the
mugger then he sculled for life
toward the lagoon

  a cry from po sungs yacht hailed
him but he paid no heed one man
could not eatch mcteague on that
night of fear and the others of the
crew were staining the black river
water with their life-blood a gleam-
ing stretch of lagoon entrance beck-
oned to the sea which was quiet star-
silvered it was the time of ebb-tide

mcteague was beyond feeling beyond
thinking horror-drugged fear-driven
possessing the strength of a maniac
as he sculled the boat north

he did not remember coming to the
lagoon where his schooner lay
but the mate told him later that they
saw him standing in the boat swaying
from side to side like a drunken man
and through the glass they recognized
captain mcteague

  there was a tremendous feast the
day after his return tukmoo and his
warriors wakened the jungle echoes
by their drums captain mcteague
lay oblivious and okey the mate did
the honors of the occasion standing
guard over the deck cot where mc-
teague lay prone exhausted weary
to death and fighting nightmares

  you ban wan great man cap-
tain okey explained later tuk-
moo ban brang pearls off po sung

debbil-debbils ban gone now how
come  

  tukmoo had raked over the wreck-
age of po sungs house and found the
casket of fine pearls it seemed a
trifling reward for laying the debbil-
debbils of po sung but captain mc-
teague only shuddered and closed his
eyes

 haul up the mud-hooks and
crowd on canvas he said to okey
when red murphy and mcmahon
and tawa and the she-ape get a
grouch on therell be hell popping
in that jungle ive seen it for the
last time not for a ships hold of
pearls will i put in at any lagoon on
the banda shore they nearly made
a monkey of me okey honored me
by fetching a trained orang-outang
from java to hold my witless brains
maybe they had my measure at that
i was fool enough to go in and idiot
enough to escape a wise man would
never have come out alive

white lilies

  by josie mcnamara lydon

     white lilies grow above your bed

     a gleaming marble marks its head

        the swaying lilies bending low

       drip crystal tears they seem to know
      i grieve for your dear spirit fled

   the world tramps by with hurried tread

     it has no time to mourn the dead

       nor has it solace to bestow

                         where lilies grow

     alone my hopeless tears are shed

     alone my futile prayers are said

dear eyes that one short year ago	

   were lit with loves celestial glow-

     forever closed above your bed

                          white lilies grow
ytmtril worrtll

loathsome shapes flapped through the night
along the way that led to the pleasure camps

past the sleeping city the river
sweeps along its left bank the
old canal creeps

  i did not intend that to be poetry
although the scene is poetic-som-
berly gruesomely poetic like the
poems of poe too well i know it-
too often have i walked over the
grass-grown path beside the reflec-
tions of black trees and tumble-down
shacks and distant factory chimneys
in the sluggish waters that moved so
slowly and ceased to move at all

  i shall be called mad and i shall
be a suicide i shall take no pains
to cover up my trail or to hide the
thing that i shall do what will it
matter afterward what they say of
me  if they knew the truth-if they
could vision even dimly the beings
with whom i have consorted-if the

faintest realization might be theirs
of the thing i am becoming and of
the fate from which i am saving their
city-then they would call me a great
hero but it does not matter what
they call me as i have said before
let me write down the things i am
about to write down and let them be
taken as they will be taken for the
last ravings of a madman the city
will be in mourning for the thing i
shall have done-but its mourning
will be of no consequence beside that
other fate from which i shall have
saved it

ihave always had a taste for noc-
turnal prowling we as a race
have grown too intelligent to take
seriously any of the old instinctive
fears that preserved us through pre-

                                  


weird tales

ceding generations our sole remain-
ing salvation then has come to he
our tendency to travel in herds we
wander at night-but our objective
is somwhere on the brightly lighted
streets or still somewhere where men
do not go alone when we travel far
afield it is in company few of my
acquaintance few in the whole city
here would care to ramble at mid-
night over the grass-grown path i
haye spoken of not because they
would fear to do so but because such
things are not being done

  well it is dangerous to differ indi-
vidually from ones fellows it is
dangerous to wander from the beaten
road and the fears that guarded the
race in the dawn of time and through
the centuries were real fears found-
ed on reality

  a month ago i was a stranger
here i had just taken my first posi-
tion-i was graduated from college
only three months before in the
spring i was lonely and likely to re-
main so for some time for i have
always been of a solitary nature
making friends slowly

  i had received one invitation out
-to visit the camp of a fellow em-
ployee in the firm for which i worked
a camp which was located on the far-
ther side of the wide river-the side
across from the city and the canal
where the bank was high and steep
and heavily wooded and little tents
blossomed all along the waters edge
at night these camps were a string
of sparkling lights and tiny leaping
eampfires and the tinkle of music
carried faintly far across the calmly
flowing water that far bank of the
river was no place for an eccentric
solitary man to love but the near
bank which would have been an eye-
sore to the campers had not the river
been so wide-the near bank attract-
ed me from my first glimpse of it

  we embarked in a motor-boat at
some distance downstream and swept
up along the near bank and then out

and across the current- i turned
my eyes backward the murk of
stagnant water that was the canal
the jumble of low buildings beyond
it the lonely low-lying waste of the
narrow strip of land between canal
and river the dark scattered trees
growing there-i intended to see
more of these things

  that week-end bored me but i re-
paid myself no later than monday
evening the first evening when i was
back in the city alone and free i
ate a solitary dinner immediately
after leaving the office i went to my
room and slept from  until nearly
midnight i wakened naturally then
for my whole heart was set on explor-
ing the alluring solitude i had dis-
covered i dressed slipped out of the
house and into the street started the
motor in my roadster which i had left
parked at the curb and drove through
the lighted streets

  i left behind that part of town
which was thick with vehicles carry-
ing people home from their evening
engagements and began to thread my
way through darker and narrower
streets once i had to back out of
a cul-de-sac and once i had to detour
around a closed block this part of
town was not alluring even to me
it was dismal without being solitary

  but when i had parked my car on
a rough cobbled street that ran di-
rectly down into the inky waters of
the canal and crossed a narrow
bridge i was repaid a few minutes
set my feet on the old tow-path where
mules had drawn river-boats up and
down only a year or so ago across
the canal now as i walked upstream
at a swinging pace the miserable
shacks where miserable people lived
seemed to march with me and then
fell behind they looked like places
in which murders might be commit-
ted every one of them

  the bridge i had crossed was near
the end of the city going north as the
eanal marked its western extremity
the canal



ten minutes of walking and the
dismal shacks were quite a dis-
tance behind the river was farther
away and the strip of waste land
much wider and more wooded and
tall trees across the canal marched
with me as the evil-looking houses had
done before far and faint the
sound of a bell in the city reached my
ears it was midnight

  i stopped enjoyed the desolation
around me it had the savor i had
expected and hoped for i stood for
some time looking ip at the sky
watching the low drift of heavy
clouds which were visible in the dull
reflected glow from distant lights in
the heart of the city so that they ap-
peared to have a lurid phosphores-
cence of their own the ground
under my feet on the contrary was
utterly devoid of light i had felt
my way carefully knowing the edge
of the canal partly by instinct partly
by the even more perfect blackness
of the water in it and even holding
pretty well to the path because it
was perceptibly sunken below the
ground beside it

  now as i stood motionless in this
spot my eyes upcast my mind adrift
with strange fancies suddenly my
feelings of satisfaction and well-being
gave way to something different fear
was an emotion unknown to me-for
those things which make men fear i
had always loved a graveyard at
night was to me a charming place for
a stroll and meditation

  but now the roots of my hair
seemed to move upright on my head
and along all the length of my spine
i was conscious of a prickling ting-
ling sensation-such as my fore-
fathers may have felt in the jungle
when the hair on their backs stood
up as the hair of my head was doing
now also i was afraid to move and
i knew that there were eyes upon
me and that that was why i was
afraid to move i was afraid of those

  eyes-afraid to see them to look into
  them

   all this while i stood perfectly
 still my face uptilted toward the
 sky but after a terrible mental ef-
 fort i mastered myself

   slowly-slowly with an attempt to
 propitiate the owner of the unseen
 eyes by my casual manner i lowered
 - my own i looked straight ahead-
 at the softly swaying silhouette of the
 tree-tops across the canal as they
 moved gently in the cool night wind
 at the mass of blackness that was
 those trees and the opposite shore
 at the shiny blackness where the re-
 flections of the elouds glinted vaguely
 and disappeared that was the canal
 and again i raised my eyes a little
 for just across the canal where the
 shadows massed most heavily there
 was that at which i must look more
 closely and now as i grew accus-
 tomed to the greater blackness and
 my pupils expanded i dimly dis-
 cerned the contours of an old boat
 or barge half sunken in the water

    an old abandoned canal-boat

   but was i dreaming or was there
 a white-clad figure seated on the roof
 of the low cabin aft a pale heart-
 shaped face gleaming strangely at me
 from the darkness the glow of two
 eyes seeming to light up the face and
 to detach it from the darkness 

    surely there could be no doubt as
 to the eyes they shone as the eyes
 of animals shine in the dark-with
 a phosphorescent gleam and a glim-
 mer of red well i had heard that
 some human eyes have that quality
 at night

   but what a place for a human be-
 ing to be-a girl too i was sure
 that daintily heart-shaped face was
 the face of a girl surely-i was see-
 ing it clearer and clearer either be-
 cause my eyes were growing more
 accustomed to peering into the deep-
 er shadows or because of that phos-
 phorescence in the eyes that stared
 back at me


weird tales

t raised my voicc softly not to break
too much the stillness of the night
hello whos there are you
lost or marooned and can i help
there was a little pause i was
conscious of a soft lapping at my
feet a stronger night wind had
sprung up was ruffling the dark
waters i had been over-warm and
where it struck me the perspiration
turned cold on my body so that i
shivered uncontrollably

  you can stay-and talk awhile
if you will i am lonely but not
lost-i-i live here

  i could hardly believe my ears
the voice was little more than a whis-
per but it had carried clearly-a
girls voice sure enough and she
lived there-in an old abandoned
canal-boat half submerged in the
stagnant water

  you are not alone there

  no not alone my father lives
here with me but he is deaf-and
he sleeps soundly

  did the night wind blow still cold-
er as though it came to us from some
unseen frozen sea-or was there
something in her tone that chilled me
even as a strange attraction drew me
toward her i wanted to draw near
to her to see closely the pale heart-
shaped face to lose myself in the
bright eyes that i had seen shining
in the darkness i wanted-i wanted
to hold her in my arms to find her

mouth with mine to kiss it-

  with a start i realized the nature
of my thoughts and for an instant
lost all thought in surprize never in
my twenty-two years had i felt love
before my fancies had been other-
wise directed-a moss-grown fallen
gravestone was a dearer thing to me
to contemplate than the fairest face
in all the world yet surely what
i felt now was love

  i took a reckless step nearer the
edge of the bank

  could i come over to you t
begged its warm and i dont

mind a wetting its late i know-
but i would give a great deal to sit
beside you and talk if only for a
few minutes before i go back to town
its a lonely place here for a girl
like you to live-your father should
not mind if you exchange a few words
with someone occasionally

  was it the unconventionality of my
request that made her next words
sound like a long-drawn shudder of
protest there was a strangeness in
the tones of her voice that held me
wondering every time she spoke

  no-no oh no you must not
sivim across

    then-could i come tomorrow or
some day soon in the daytime and
would you let me come on board then
-or would you come on shore and
talk to me perhaps

  not in the daytime-never in the
daytime  

  again the intensity of her low-
toned negation held me spellbound

  it was not her sense of the impro-
priety of the hour then that had dic-
tated her manner for surely any
girl with the slightest sense of the fit-
ness of things would rather have a
tryst by daytime than after midnight
-yet there was an inference in her
last words that if i came again it
should be again at night

  still feeling the spell that had en-
thralled me as one does not forget the
presence of a drug in the air that is
stealing ones senses even when those
senses begin to wander and to busy
themselves with other things i yet
spoke shortly

  why do you say never in the
daytime do you mean that i may
come more than this once at night
though now you wont let me cross
the canal to you at the expense of my
own clothes and you wont put down
your plank or drawbridge or what-
ever you come on shore with and talk
to me here for only a moment ill
come again if youll let me talk to
you instead of calling across the
the canal



water ill come again any time you
will let me-day or night i dont
care i want to come to you but i
only ask you to explain if i came in
the daytime and met your father
wouldnt that be the best thing to do
then we could be really acquainted-
we could be friends

  in the night time my father
sleeps in the daytime i sleep how
could i talk to you or introduce you
to my father then  if you came on
board this boat in the daytime you
would find my father-and you would
be sorry as for me i would be
sleeping i could never introduce
you to my father do you see
you sleep soundly you and your
father again there was pique in
my voice

  yes we sleep soundly

  and always at different times
always at different times we
are on guard-one of us is always on
guard we have been hardly used
down there in your city and we
have taken refuge here and we are
always-always-on guard

  the resentment vanished from my
breast and i felt my heart go out to
her anew she was so pale so pitiful
in the night my eyes were learning
better and better how to pierce the
darkness they were giving me a more
definite picture of my companion-
if i could think of her as a compan-
ion between myself and whom
stretched the black water

  the sadness of the lonely scene the
perfection of the solitude itself these
things contributed to her pitifulness
then there was that strangeness of
atmosphere of which even yet i had
only partly taken note there was the
strange shivering chill which yet did
not seem like the healthful chill of a
cool evening in fact it did not pre-
vent me from feeling the oppression
of the night which was unusually
sultry it was like a little breath of
deadly cold that came and went and
yet did not alter the temperature of

the air itself as the small ripples on
the surface of water do not concern
the water even a foot down

  and even that was not all there
was an unwholesome smell about the
night-a dank moldy smell that
might have been the very breath of
death and decay even i the con-
noisseur in all things dismal and un-
wholesome tried to keep my mind
from dwelling overmuch upon that
smell what it must be to live breath-
ing it constantly in i could not think
but no doubt the girl and her father
were used to it and no doubt it came
from the stagnant water of the canal
and from the rotting wood of the old
half-sunken boat that was their ref-
uge

  my heart throbbed with pity again
their refuge-what a place and my
clearer vision of the girl showed me
that she was pitifully thin even
though possessed of the strange face
that drew me to her her clothes
hung around her like old rags but
hers was no scarecrow aspect al-
though little flesh clothed her bones
her very bones were beautiful i was
sure the little pale heart-shaped face
would be more beautiful still if i
could only see it closely i must see
it closely-i must establish some
claim to consideration as a friend of
the strange lonely crew of the half-
sunken wreck

  this is a poor place to call a ref-
uge   i said finally  one might have
very little money and yet do some-
what better perhaps i might help
you-i am sure i could if your ill-
treatment in the city was because of
poverty-i am not rich but i could
help that i could help you a little
with money-if you would let me-
or in any case i could find a position
for you im sure i could do that

  the eyes that shone fitfully toward
me like to small pools of avater in-
termittently lit by a cloud-swept sky
seemed to glow more biightly she
had been half crouching half sitting


weird tales

on top of the cabin now she leaped
to her feet with one quick sinuous
abrupt motion and took a few rapid
restless steps to and fro before she
answered

  when she spoke her voice was little
more than a whisper yet surely rage
was in its shrill sibilance

    fool do you think you would be
helping me to tie me to a desk to
shut me behind doors away from free-
dom away from the delight of doing
my own will of seeking my own way
never never would i let you do that
rather this old boat rather a deserted
grave under the stars for my home  

  a boundless surprize swept over
me and a positive feeling of kinship
with this strange being whose face
i had hardly seen possessed me so
i myself might have spoken-so i had
often felt though i had never
dreamed of putting my thoughts so
definitely so forcibly my regular-
ized daytime life was a thing i
thought little of i really lived only
in my nocturnal prowlings why
this girl was right all of life should
be free-and spent in places that in-
terested and attracted

  how little how little i knew that
night that dread forces were tugging
at my soul were finding entrance to
it and easy access through the mor-
bid weakness of my nature how
little i knew at what a cost i deviated
so radically from my kind who herd
in cities and love well-lit ways and the
sight of man and sweet and whole-
some places to be solitary in when
the desire for solitude comes over
them

  that night it seemed to me that
there was but one important thing
in life-to allay the angry passion my
unfortunate words had aroused in the
breast of my beloved and to win from
her some answering feeling

  i understand-much better than
you think i whispered tremu-
lously

  what i want is to see you again
to come to know you and to serve
you in any way that i may surely
there must be something in which i
can be of use to you all you have to
do from tonight on forever is to com-
mand me i swear it

  you swear that-you do swear
it

  delighted at the eagerness of her
words i lifted my hand toward the
dark heavens

  i swear it from this night on
forever-i swear it

    then listen tonight you may not
come to me nor i to you i do not
want you to board this boat not to-
night not any night and most of
all not any day but do not look so
sad i will come to you no not
tonight perhaps not for many nights
-yet before very long i will come to
you there on the bank of the canal
when the water in the canal ceases to
flow  

  i must have made a gesture of im-
patience or of despair it sounded
like a way of saying never-for
why should the water in the canal
cease to flow she read my thoughts
in some way-for she answered them

  you do not understand i am
speaking seriously-i am promising
to meet you there on the bank and
soon for the water within these
banks is moving slower always slower
higher up i have heard that the
canal has been drained between
these lower locks the water still seeps
in and drops slowly slowly down-
stream but there will come a night
when it will be quite quite stagnant
-and on that night i will come to
you and when i come i will ask of
you a favor and you will keep your
oath

it was all the assurance i could get
that night she had come back
to the side of the cabin where she
had sat crouched before and she re-
the canal



sumed again that posture and sat still
and silent watching me sometimes
i could see her eyes upon me and
sometimes not but i felt that their
gaze was unwavering thelittle cold
breeze which i had finally forgotten
while i was talking with her was
blowing again and the unwholesome
smell of decay grew- heavier before
the dawrn

  she would not speak again nor
answer me when i spoke to her and
i grewr nervous and strangely ill at
ease

  at last i wrent away and in the
first faint light of dawn i slipped up
the stairs of my rooming-house and
into my own room

  i was deadly tired at the office next
day and day after day slipped away
and i grew more and more weary
for a man can not wrake day and
night without suffering especially in
hot weather and that was what i was
doing i haunted the old tow-path
and waited night after night on the
bank opposite the sunken boat some-
times i saw my lady of the darkness
and sometimes not when i saw her
she spoke little but sometimes she
sat there on the top of the cabin and
let me watch her till the dawn or
until the strange uneasiness that was
like fright drove me from her and
back to my room where i tossed rest-
lessly in the heat and dreamed strange
dreams half waking till the sun shone
in on my forehead and i tumbled into
my clothes and down to the office
again

  once i asked her why she had made
the fanciful condition that she would
not come ashore to meet me until the
waters of the canal had ceased to run
how eagerly i studied those waters
howr i stole awray at noontime more
than once not to approach the old
boat but to watch the almost imper-
ceptible downward drift of bubbles
bits of straw twigs rubbish

  my questioning displeased her and

i asked her that no more it was
enough that she chose to be whimsical
my part was to wait

  it was more than a week later that
i questioned her again this time on a
different subject and after that i
curbed my curiosity relentlessly

  never speak to me of things you
do not understand about me never
again or i will not showr myself to
you again and when i walk on the
path yonder it will not be with you 

  i had asked her what form of per-
secution she and her father had suf-
fered in the city that had driven them
out to this lonely place and where in
the city they had lived

  frightened seriously lest i lose the
ground i was sure i had gained with
her i was about to speak of something
else but before i could find the
wtords her low voice came to me again

  it was horrible-horrible those
little houses belowr the bridge those
houses along the canal-tell me are
they not worse than my boat life
there was shut in and furtive i was
not free as i am now-and the free-
dom i will soon have will make me
forget the things i have not yet for-
gotten the screaming the reviling
and cursing  fear and flight as
you pass back by those houses think
liow you would like to be shut in one
of them and in fear of your life and
then think of them no more-for i
would forget them and i will never
speak of them again  

  i dared not answer her i was
surprized that she had vouchsafed me
so much but surely her words meant
this-that before she had come to live
on the decaying water-rotted old boat
she had lived in one of those horrible
houses i passed by on my way to her
those houses each of wthich looked
like the predestined scene of a mur-
der

  as i left her that night i felt that
i was very daring


weird tales

  one or two nights more and you
will walk beside me i called to her
i have watched the water at noon
and it hardly moves at all i threw
a scrap of paper into the canal and
it whirled and swung a little where a
thin skim of oil lay on the water down
there-oil from the big dirty city you
are well out of but though i watched
and watched i could not see it move
downward at all perhaps tomorrow
night or the night after you will walk
on the bank with me i hope it will
be clear and moonlight and i will be
near enough to see you clearly-as
well as you seem always to see me in
darkness or moonlight equally well
and perhaps i will kiss you-but not
unless you let me  

  and yet the next day for the first
time my thoughts were definitely
troubled i had been living in a
dream-i began to speculate concern-
ing the end of the path on which my
feet were set

  i had conceived from the first such
a horror of those old houses by the
canal they were well enough to
walk past nursing gruesome thoughts
for a midnight treat but much as
i loved all that was weird and eery
about the girl i was wooing so
strangely it was a little too much for
my fancy that she had come from
them

  by this time i had become decid-
edly unpopular in my place of busi-
ness not that i had made enemies
but that my peculiar ways had caused
too much adverse comment it would
have taken very little i think to
have made the entire office force de-
cide that i was mad after the events
of the next twenty-four hours and
after this letter is found and read
they will be sure that they knew it
all along at this time however they
were punctiliously polite to me and
merely let me alone as much as pos-
sible-which suited me perfectly i
dragged wearily through day after

day exhausted for lack of sleep con-
scious of their speculative glances
living only for the night to come

  but on this day i approached the
man who had invited me to the camp
across the river who had unknowingly
shown me the way that led to my love

  have you ever noticed the row
of tumble-down houses along the canal
on the city side i asked him

  he gave me an odd look i sup-
pose he sensed the significance of my
breaking silence after so long to speak
of them-sensed that in some way i
had a deep interest in them

  you have odd tastes morton he
said after a moment i suppose you
wander into strange places sometimes
-ive heard you speak of an enthusi-
asm for graveyards at night but my
advice to you is to keep away from
those houses theyre unsavory and
their reputation is unsavory posi-
tively i thinly youd be in danger of
your life if you go poking around
there they have been the scene of
several murders and a dope den or
two has been cleaned out of them
why in the world you should want to
investigate them-

  i dont expect to investigate
them i said testily i was merely
interested in them-from the outside
to tell you the truth id heard a
story a rumor-never mind where
but you say there have been murders
there-i suppose this rumor i heard
may have had to do with an attempted
one there was a girl who lived there
with her father once-and they were
set upon there or something of the
sort and had to run away did you
ever hear that story

  barrett gave me an odd look such
as one gives in speaking of a past
horror so dreadful that the mere
speaking of it makes it live terribly
again

  what you say reminds me of a
horrible thing that was said to have
happened down there once he said
it was in all the papers a little
the canal



child disappeared in one of those
houses-and a couple of poor lodgers
who lived there a girl and her father
were accused of having made away
with it they were accused-they
were accused-oh well i dont like
to talk about such things it was too
dreadful the childs body was
found-part of it was found it was
mutilated and the people in the house
seemed to believe it had been muti-
lated in order to conceal the manner
of its death-there was an ugly wound
in the throat it finally came out and
it seemed as if the child might have
been bled to death it was found in
the girls room hidden away the
old man and his daughter escaped
before the police were called the
countryside was scoured for them
-the whole country was scoured but
they were never found why you
must have read it in the papers sev-
eral years ago

  i nodded with a heavy heart i had
read it in the papers i remembered
now and again a terrible question-
ing came over me who was this
girl what was this girl who seemed
to have mv heart in her keeping

  why did not a merciful god let me
die then

  befogged with exhaustion bemused
in a dire enchantment my mind was
incapable of thought and yet some
soul-process akin to that which saves
the sleepwalker poised at perilous
heights sounded its warning now

  my mind was filled with doleful
images there were women-i had
heard and read-who slew to satisfy
a blood-lust there were ghosts spec-
ters-call them what you will their
names have been legion in the dark
pages of that lore which dates back
to the infancy of the races of the
earth-who retained even in death
this blood-lust vampires-they had
been called that i had read of them
corpses by day spirits of evil by
night roaming abroad in their own

forms or in the forms of bats or un-
clean beasts killing body and soul of
their victims-for whoever dies of the
repeated kiss of the vampire
which leaves its mark on the throat
and draws the blood from the body
becomes a vampire also-of such be-
ings i had read

  and horror of horrors in that
last cursed day at the office i remem-
bered reading of these vampires-
these undead-that in their nocturnal
flights they had one limitation-they
could not cross running water

that night i went my usual nightly
way with tears of weakness on
my face-for my weakness was su-
preme and i recognized fully at last
the misery of being the victim of an
enchantment stronger than my feeble
will but i went

  i approached the neighborhood
of the canal-boat as the distant city
clock chimed the first stroke of 
it was the dark of the moon and the
sky was overcast heat-lightning
flickered low in the sky seeming to
come from every point of the compass
and circumscribe the horizon as if un-
seen fires burned behind the rim of
the world by its fitful glimmer i saw
a new thing-between the old boat
and the canal bank stretched a long
slim solid-looking shadow-a plank
had been let down in that moment
i realized that i had been playing
with powers of evil wrhich had no in-
tent now to let me go which were in-
deed about to lay hold upon me with
an inexorable grasp why had i
come tonight why but that the
spell of the enchantment laid upon me
was a thing more potent and far more
unbreakable than any wholesome
spell of love  the creature i sought
out-oh i remembered now with the
cold perspiration beading my brow
the lore hidden away between the
covers of the dark old book which i
had read so many years ago and half
forgotten-until dim memories of it


weird tales

stirred within me this last day and
night

  my lady of the night no woman
of wholesome flesh and blood and odd
perverted tastes that matched my own
but one of the undead in that mo-
ment i knew it and knew that the
vampires of old legends polluted still
in these latter days the fair surface
of the earth

  and on the instant behind me in
the darkness there was the crackle
of a twig and something brushed
against my arm

  this then was the fulfilment of
my dream i knew without turning
my head that the pale dainty face
with its glowing eyes was near my
own-that i had only to stretch out
my arm to touch the slender grace of
the girl i had so longed to draw near
i knew and should have felt the
rapture i had anticipated instead
the roots of my hair prickled coldly
unendurably as they had on the night
when i had first sighted the old boat
the miasmic odors of the night heavy
and oppressive with heat and unre-
lieved by a breath of air all but
overcame me and i fought with my-
self to prevent my teeth clicking in
my head the little waves of coldness
i had felt often in this spot were chas-
ing over my body yet they were not
from any breeze the leaves on the
trees hung down motionless as though
they were actually wilting on their
branches

  with an effort i turned my head

 two hands caught me around my
neck the pale face was so near that
i felt the warm breath from its nos-
trils fanning my cheek

  and suddenly all that was whole-
some in my perverted nature rose up-
permost i longed for the touch of
the red mouth like a dark fipwer
opening before me in the night i
longed for it-and yet more i dreaded
it i shrank back catching in a
powerful grip the fragile wrists of
the hands that strove to hold me i

must not-i must not yield to the
faintness that i felt stealing languor-
ously over me

  i was facing down the path toward
the city a low rumble of thunder-
the first-broke the torrid hush of the
summer night a glare of lightning
seemed to tear the night asunder to
light up the whole universe over-
head the clouds were careening mad-
ly in fantastic shapes driven by a
wind that swept the upper heavens
without as yet causing even a trem-
bling in the air lower down and far
down the canal that baleful glare
seemed to play around and hover over
the little row of shanties-murder-
cursed and haunted by the ghost of
a dead child

  my gaze was fixed on them while i
held away from me the pallid face
and fought off the embrace that
sought to overcome my resisting will
and so a long moment passed the
glare faded out of the sky and a
greater darkness took the world but
there was a near more menacing glare
fastened upon my face-the glare of
two eyes that watched mine that had
watched me as i unthinking stared
down at the dark houses

 this girl-this woman who had
come to me at my own importunate
requests did not love me since i had
shrunk from her she did not love
me but it was not only that she had
watched me as i gazed down at the
houses that held her dark past-and
i was sure that she divined my
thoughts she knew my horror of
those houses-she knew my new-born
horror of her and she hated me for
it hated me more malignantly than
i had believed a human being could
hate

  and at that point in my thoughts
i felt my skin prickle and my scalp
rise again could a human being cher-
ish such hatred as i read trembling
more and more in those glowing fires
lit with what seemed to me more like
the canal



the fires of hell than any light that
ought to shine in a womans eyes

  and through ail this not a word
had passed between us

so far i have written calmly i
wish that i could write on so to
the end if i could do that there
might be one or two of those who
will regard this as the document
of a maniac who would believe the
horrors of which i am about to write

  but i am only flesh and blood at
this point in the happenings of the
awful night my calmness deserted me
-at this point i felt that i had been
drawn into the midst of a horrible
nightmare from which there was no
escape no waking as i write this
feeling again overwhelms me until
i can hardly write at all-until were
it not for the thing which i must do

i would rush out into the street and
run screaming until i was caught
and dragged away to be put behind
strong iron bars perhaps i would
feel safe there-perhaps

  i know that terrified at the hate
i saw confronting me in those redly
gleaming eyes i would have slunk
away the two thin hands that
caught my arm again were strong
enough to prevent that however i
had been spared her kiss-i was not
to escape from the oath i had taken
to serve her

  you promised-you swore she
hissed in my ear and tonight you
are to keep your oath

  i felt my senses reel my oath-
yes i had an oath to keep i had
lifted my hand toward the dark heav-
ens and sworn to serve her in any
way she chose-freely and of my own 
volition i had sworn

  i sought to evade her

  let me help you back to your
boat   i begged you have no kindly
feeling for me-and-you have seen
it-i love you no longer i will go
back to the city-you can go back to

your father and forget that i broke
your peace

  the laughter that greeted my
speech i shall never forget-not in
the depths under the scummy surfaee
of the canal-not in the empty places
between the worlds where my tor-
tured soul may wander

  so you do not love me and i hate
you pool have i waited these
weary months for the water to stop
only to go back now after my
father and i returned here and found
the old boat rotting in the drained
canal and took refuge in it when the
water was turned into the canal while
i slept so that i could never escape
until its flow should cease because of
the thing that i am-even then i
dreamed of tonight

  when the imprisonment we still
shared ceased to matter to my father
-come on board the deserted boat to-
morrow and see why if you dare-
still i dreamed on of tonight 

  i have been lonely desolate starv-
ing-now the whole world shall be
mine and by your help

  i asked her somehow what she
wanted of me and a madness over-
came me so that i hardly heard her
reply yet somehow i knew that
there was that on the opposite shore
of the great river where the pleasure
camps were that she wanted to find
in the madness of my terror she made
me understand and obey her

  i must carry her in my arms across
the long bridge over the river de-
serted in the small hours of the night

  the way back to the city was long
tonight-iong she walked behind me
and i turned my eyes neither to right
nor left only as i passed the tumble-
down houses i saw their reflection in
he canal and trembled so that i
could have fallen to the ground at
the thoughts of the little child this
woman had been accused of slaying
there and at the certainty i felt that
she was reading my thoughts


weird tales

  and now the horror that engulfed
me darkened my brain

  i know that we set our feet upon
the long wide bridge that spanned
the river i know the storm broke
there so that i battled for my footing
almost for my life it seemed against
the pelting deluge and the horror i
had invoked was in my arms cling-
ing to me burying its head upon my
shoulder so increasingly dreadful
had my pale-faced companion become
to me that i hardly thought of her
now as a woman at all-only as a
demon of the night

  the tempest raged still as she
leaped down out of my arms on the
other shore and again i walked with
her against my will while the trees
lashed their branches madly around
me showing the pale undersides of
their leaves in the vivid frequent
flashes that rent the heavens

  on and on we went branches flying
through the air and missing us by a
miracle of ill fortune such as she
and i are not slain by falling
branches the river was a welter of
whitecaps flattened down into strange
shapes by the pounding rain the
clouds as we glimpsed them were like
devils flying through the sky

  past dark tent after dark tent we
stole and past a few where lights
burned dimly behind their canvas
walls and at last we came to an old
quarry into its artificial ravine she
led me and up to a crevice in the
rock wall

  reach in your hand and pull out
the loose stone you will feel she
whispered it closes an opening that
leads into deep caverns a human
hand must remove that stone-your
hand must move it 

  why did i struggle so to disobey
her why did i fail it was as
though i knew-but my failure was
foreordained-i had taken oath

if you who read have believed that
i have set down the truth thus
far the little that is left you will call
the ravings of a madman overtaken
by his madness yet these things
happened

  i stretched out my arm driven by
a compulsion i could not resist at
arms length in the niche in the rock
i felt something move-the loose rock
a long narrow fragment much
larger than i had expected yet it
moved easily seeming to swing on a
natural pivot outward it swung
toppling toward me-a moment more
and there was a swift rush of the
ponderous weight i had loosened i
leaped aside and went dowrn my fore-
head grazed by the rock

  for a brief moment i must have
been unconscious but only for a mo-
ment my head a stabbing agony of
pain unreal lights flashing before my
eyes i yet knew the reality of the
storm that beat me down as i strug-
gled to my feet i knew the reality
of the dark loathsome shapes that
passed me in the dark crawling out
of the orifice in the rock and flapping
through the wild night along the way
that led to the pleasure camps

  so the caverns i had laid open to
the outer world were infested with
bats i had been inside unlit caverns
and had heard there the squeaking of
the things felt and heard the flapping
of their wtings-but never in all my
life before had i seen bats as large as
men and women

  sick and dizzy from the blow on my
head and from disgust i crept along
the way they were going if i touched
one of them i felt that i should die
of horror

  now at last the storm abated and
a heavy darkness made the whole
world seem like the inside of a tomb

  where the tents stood in a long row
the number of the monster bats
seemed to diminish it was as though
- horrible thought - they were
the canal



creeping into the tents with their
slumbering occupants

  at last i came to a lighted tent
and paused crouching so that the dim
radiance that shone through the can-
vas did not touch me in the shadows
and there i waited but not for long
there was a dark form silhouetted
against the tent-a movement of the
flap ofthe tent-a rustle and confu-
sion and the dark thing was again in
silhouette-but with a difference in
the quality of the shadow the dark
thing was inside the tent now its bat
wings extending across the entrance
through which it had crept

  fear held me spellbound and as
i looked the shadow changed again-
imperceptibly so that i could not
have told how it changed

  but now it was not the shadow of
a bat but of a woman

  the storm-the storm i am lost
exhausted-i crept in here to beg for
refuge until the dawn

  that low thrilling sibilant voice-
too well i knew it

  within the tent i heard a murmur
of acquiescent voices at last i began
to understand

  i knew the nature of the woman i
had carried over the river in my arms
the woman who would not even cross
the canal until the water should have
ceased utterly to flow i remembered
books i had read-dracula-other
books and stories i knew they were
true books and stories now-i knew
those horrors existed for me

  i had indeed kept my oath to the
creature of darkness-i had brought
her to her kind under her guidance
i had let them loose in hordes upon
the pleasure camps the campers
were doomed-and through them
others-

  i forgot my fear i rushed from my
hiding-place up to the tent door and
there i screamed and called aloud

  dont take her in-dont let her
stay-nor the others that have crept
into the other tents wake all the

campers-they will sleep on to their
destruction drive out the inter-
lopers-drive them out quickly
they are not human-no and they
are not bats do you hear me-do
you understand

  i was fairly howling in a voice that
was strange to me

  she is a vampire-they are all
vampires vampires

  inside the tent i heard a new voice
what can be the matter with that
poor man    the voice said it was a
womans and gentle

    crazy-somebody out of his sens-
es dear a mans voice answered
dont be frightened

  and then the voice i knew so well
-so well i saw a falling rock strike
a man on the head in the storm he
staggered away but i suppose it
crazed him

  i waited for no more i ran away
madly through the night and back
across the bridge to the city

  next day-today-i boarded the
sunken canal-boat it is the abode of
death-no woman could have lived
there-only such an one as she the
old mans corpse was there-he must
have died long long ago the smell
of death and of decay on the boat
was dreadful

  again i felt that i understood
back in those awful houses she had
committed the crime when first she
became the thing she is and he-
her father-less sin-steeped and less
accursed attempted to destroy the
evidence of her crime and fled with
her but died without becoming like
her she had said that one of those
two was always on watch-did he in-
deed divide her vigil on the boat
what more fitting-the dead standing
watch with the undead and no won-
der that she would not let me board
the craft of death even to carry her
away

  and still i feel the old compulsion
i have been spared her kiss-but for
a little while yet i will not let the


weird tales

power of my oath to her draw me
back till i enter the caverns with her
and creep forth in the form of a bat
to prey upon mankind before that
can happen i too will die

today in the city i heard that a
horde of strange insects or small
animals infested the pleasure camps
last night some said with horror-
bated breath that they perhaps were
rats none of them was seen but in
the morning nearly every camper had
a strange deep wound in his throat i
almost laughed aloud they were so
horrified at the idea of an army of
rats creeping into the tents and bit-
ing the sleeping occupants on their
throats if they had seen what i
saw-if they knew that they are
doomed to spread corruption-

   so my own death will not be
 enough today i bought supplies
 for blasting tonight i will set my
 train of dynamite from the hole i
 made in the cliff where the vampires
 creep in and out along the row of
 tents as far as the last one-then
 i shall light my fuse it will be done
 before the dawn tomorrow the
 city will mourn its dead and oxecrate
 my name

    and then at last in the slime be-
 neath the unmoving waters of the
 canal i shall find peace but per-
 haps it will not be peace-for i shall
 seek it midway between the old boat
 with its cargo of death and the row
 of dismal houses where a little child
 was done to death when first she
 became the thing she is that is my
  expiation

    the snakelike vines reach out on every side
    weaving a swing where chimpanzees may ride
    and chatter in the sullen lifeless noon
    while all about the purple shadows swoon

    the crumbling logs of trees lie everywhere
    encrusted with rare orchids here and there-
    deceiving bits of loveliness to lure
    unwary feet that brave the sodden moor

    the moon looks in between the fronded beams
    of wicked plants that stand until it seems
    the night is made of moss and leaf and bole-

it was on a heavily laden troop-
ship westward heading hours
before the sun had gone down
toward china trailing ebon night
behind her for a full week since
dropping the california coast behind
us there had been nothing in all the
wild waste of waters for us to see
save ourselves no ships funnels
broke the lowering horizon no sign
of land for our skipper had chosen
a passage lying somewhere in between
the usual steamer lanes the nearest
land save that which stretched in
eternal darkness some three miles
below us was more than a thousand
miles beyond the southern horizon
we were just a single ship burdened
with a precious freight of souls upon
an ocean that seemed endless the
first day out had been squally and

everyone had been sick save those
of us who had gone down to the sea
in ships before but with the dawn-
ing of the second morning the sea
had calmed down and our vessel rode
through the blue toward the hori-
zon bowl which ever crept before
us in the golden wake of the setting
sun the voyage if the old salts
spoke truly would be uneventful
but with that strange premonitory
feeling which comes to all of us at
times i did not believe them

  something from the very first
warned me that our voyage was ill-
fated i couldnt explain my feeling
it wasnt a feeling of dread exactly
nor of fear just a strange feeling
of unease much like that which comes
to people on their first voyage when
a ship is rolling slightly under their

                                  


weird tales

feet and everything until they get
their sea-legs seems strangely out of
focus tliat doesnt explain it i
know but it is as near as i can put
my feeling into words

  i knew when the sun went down
ahead of us with the hundred and
eightieth meridian less than twenty-
four hours ahead that we were on
the eve of strange momentous hap-
penings to add to my feeling of
unease and as though it had been all
planned out by some invisible some-
thing or somebody in the vague
beginning the officer who should have
had the watch that night fell sudden-
ly ill and i was called upon to take
his place i knew as i donned my
belt holster and pistol that i but
obeyed the will of some invisible
prompter-a prompter without a
name

  we had seven sentries out at vari-
ous important places about the ship
and i made the routine inspections
before turning in less than an hour
before midnight when i entered my
stateroom and turned on the light
that feeling of unease was more pro-
nounced than it had been at any time
previously i had the feeling though
i had locked my door when i had last
quitted my stateroom that i had en-
tered again immediately after some-
one had left it yet that was impos-
sible i had carried the key in my
pocket all the time and my cabin-
boy was not provided with one
there was no way that anyone or
anything could have entered my
stateroom in my absence save-

  still as though my every move had
been ordered by some invisible
prompter my eyes darted to the
port-hole beside my bed it was
quite too small for the passage of a
human body and even to think of
such a thing were the utmost folly
if anyone had gone out through the
port-hole that one had fallen or
plunged into the sea for had the
port-hole been ever so big there was

absolutely no way one could have
left my stateroom by that way and
still remained upon the ship-unless
that one had gone out and were even
now hanging by his hands along the
ships side so strongly had the
feeling of an alien presence obtruded
itself upon me that in spite of know-
ing myself an utter fool for enter-
taining any doubt whatsoever i
strode to the port-hole and looked
out there was nothing of course
save water now black and forbidding
stretching away to the south to a
horizon that since night had fallen
seemed to have crept quite close to us
to watch our passing

  still unsatisfied in spite of argu-
ing with myself condemning myself
for a fool i deliberately closed the
glass which masked the port took my
seat in a chair beside the bunk facing
the round glass-which resembled
to an imagination suddenly fevered
the eye of a huge one-eyed giant-
of the port-hole and began to un-
dress mechanically i lifted first one
foot and then the other removing
shoes and stoekings

  but i kept my eyes upon the closed
port-hole-and that feeling of an
unseen presence in the room was
stronger as the moments fled my
undressing completed i stood erect
to turn out the lights and paused in
the very act a cry of terror smothered
in my throat by a sheer act of will

  for for the most fleeting of sec-
onds i had seen a dead-white face
outside the glass which covered the
port-hole it was the face of a per-
son who had drowned i told myself
wildly and the dripping hair wore
a coronet of fluttering seaweed the
eyes of this strange outsider stared
straight into mine devoid of expres-
sion totally unwinking and the lips
whieh seemed blue as though with
icy cold long endured smiled a thin
and ironic smile it took all the
courage i possessed which is little
enough in the face of the unknown
bells of oceana



to hurl myself across the bed right
hand extended toward the heavy
screw which held the circular piece
of glass in place in the instant my
hand would have touched the glass
the ship rode into the edge of the
storm that was to fill the remainder
of the night and the stern of the
steamer rose dizzily  the crest of
a mighty wave dragging all the ves-
sel with it-and the face slid slowly
out of sight below the port-hole the
bluish lips still smiling ironically

  i admit that i was trembing that
my fingers were unsteady as i fum-
bled with the screw to unloose the
glass when the port-hole was open
once more and the cold breeze of this
latitude came in to fan my fevered
face i thrust my head out of the port
and gazed right and left and up and
down along the curving side of the
ship but there was nothing-save
straight ahead on our port side
and even there there was nothing
but black water huge mountainous
waves touched with whitecaps at
their crests like flying shrouds or
like lacy streamers created as a fringe
for the mantle of night

  i watched several of the waves
sweep under the vessel which rose
and fell sluggishly the waves
seemed to be traveling in no cer-
tain direction but broke into a
veritable welter of warring forces
roaring as they came together with
the roaring of maddened deep-
throated bulls valleys with dark-
ness on their floors mountain-tops
touched with snow that shifted eerily
in the breeze

i was about to close the port when
many yards away from the ship
as though born of the womb of old
ocean i heard the bells

   like the tiny bells which the bell-
wether wears to signal the ewes and
the lambs was the tinkling of the
bells-like those bells yet not like
them totally out of place in mid-

ocean and i felt a strange prickling
of the scalp as i listened hurriedly
driven by a fear i could not have
explained then nor can i now ex-
plain i closed the port-hole again
and whirled about with another
scream which this time came forth
from my quivering lips in spite of all
i could do to prevent

  just inside my stateroom door
stood my sergeant of the guard and
his lips were trembling more wildly
than my own his eyes protruded
horribly his face was chalk-white
and he was striving with all his
power to speak as i watched his
manful struggle i dreaded for him
to speak-for i knew that what he
had come to tell me would be some-
thing strange and terrible something
hitherto entirely outside my experi-
ence

  sir he managed at last when
i stiffly nodded permission for him
to speak i just made the rounds
of the sentries

  here the poor fellow stopped un-
able to go on and his knees knocked
together audibly

  yes sergeant i managed to
mutter you went the usual rounds
of the sentries and then   

  the sentry who should be on duty
on the main deck forward of the
bridge is missing

  of course i knew on the instant
that there might be many reasons for
the failure of the sergeant of the
guard to find the sentry many logi-
cal reasons the sentry might have
quitted his post a violation of regu-
lations true for a quiet cigarette in
the lee of a lifeboathe might have
been walking his post in the direction
taken by the sergeant so that the
latter had not overtaken him even
with a complete circling of the main
deck he might-oh there were many
logical explanations but i guessed
instinctively that none of these rea-
sons fitted the case for one tiling
the sergeant of the guard was an


weird tales

old-timer had spent many years of
his life at sea-yet he was frightened
half out of his wits and i knew he
held as many decorations for bravery
as any other officer or man in the
marine corps there was something
terrible something-if you will-
uncanny behind this disappearance
of the sentry

  i muttered an oath more to prod
my own flagging courage than for
any other reason and started toward
the door motioning the sergeant to
precede me but he shook his head
stubbornly and barred my way i
halted for it was evident that he had
not completed his report

  youll maybe think me daft he
said but i couldnt let you go out
there sir without telling you every-
thing the corporal on watch at the
head of the promenade gangway told
me a strange story just before i made
my rounds he opened the door lead-
ing onto the starboard promenade
for a look at the weather outside
and just as he was about to close it
again the ship lifted on the crest cff
a huge wave-and out beyond the
wave many yards away from the
ship he heard something which he
likened to the tinkling of little bells  
good god i exclaimed

  and the sergeant continued
all the time i was looking for the
missing sentry i had the idea there
was someone behind me following
me every step of the way yet when
i whirled to look the deck behind
me was empty

  and you found no sign of the
sentry i said stupidly

  the sergeant shook his head
nothing he said except-
except-well sir youll maybe think
me dart as i said before but on the
spot where the sentry had stood to
wait for me on my last round i
found wet marks on the deck floor-
the marks as near as i could tell
with my flashlight of bare feet
mechanically as the sergeant spoke

i had been donning my clothes leav-
ing my shoes however unlaced i
felt an icy chill along my spine as
the sergeant continued and i dread-
ed as i had never dreaded anything
before to ask him further about those
wet footprints on the deck

  the wet footprints he went on
and he was talking wildly now his
words tripping over one another so
rapidly were they uttered as though
he wished to finish his report before
i could interrupt again led away
where the sentry should have been
standing straight to the starboard
rail right at the rail i stooped to
examine the prints more closely
they were the footprints of a human
being i was sure and the marks of
the toes were blurred and very wide
as though whoever-or whatever-
had made them had been carrying
a burden in his arms  

    good god sergeant  i said
again what are you driving at

  just this sir theres something
terribly wrong with this ship some-
thing took that sentry bodily over the
side

  i believe that putting a name
however meaningless to what was in
my own mind caused a little of my
courage to return for i did not find
it difficult now to bring myself to
leave the stateroom the sergeant
almost trod on my heels as i hurried
to the main deck starboard side
where the wind wrapped icy fingers
around me clfilling me to the bone
on the instant

  as i hurried forward i looked over
the side into the welter of waters-
and stopped short

  behind me the sergeant groaned-
hollowly like a man who has been
mortally wounded for out of the
waters away to starboard came the
sound of tinkling bells i darted to
the rail and leaned far outboard
striving to pierce the gloom but
there was nothing save the watery
wastes mountains and valleys-and
bells of oceana



two spots of greenish phospho-
rescence far out like serpents eyes
which watched the passing ship but
when i looked at them closely strain-
ing my eyes seeking the form below
the eyes the twin balls of eery flame
vanished a wall of water obtruding
itself between

xell we found the sentry
  sprawled on his face where
the sergeant should have found him
on his rounds i turned the body
over and it was quite cold-with
excellent reason the corpse was
dripping wet entirely nude and the
lips and cheeks as coldly blue as
though the corpse had been dragged
for hours on a line in the wake of the
ship

  no matter how secluded ones life
may have been no matter how care-
fully one may have been guarded
during ones lifetime there come into
the lives of most of us certain inex-
plicable happenings which may never
be forgotten this matter of the
dead sentry was one of these for me
and i shall go to my grave with the
memory of his cold cheeks and bluish
lips limned upon the retina of my
very soul so many strange circum-
stances-thank god that at the
moment i could not look into the two
hours or more of terror which even
then stretched before me else i
should most surely have gone entirely
mad-were there connected with
this matter that taken altogether it
is little wonder that i have been
unable to forget or ever shall forget
the roaring of the wind which wras
lashing all the ocean into fury a
maelstrom in midocean ghostly
whitecaps stretching away into dark-
ness into seeming infinity the
frightened sergeant behind me his
teeth chattering with fear the dead
sentry at my feet his body blue with
cold entirely nude as i have said
the marks on the deck of huge bare
feet wet as though the feet had come

up out of the sea the eery sound of
bells between our vessel and the low-
ering horizon-and that dead-white
face which i had seen beyond the
port-hole of my own cabin a half-
hour before

  what was the explanation of it all
what was the cause of the bells if
bells there were what had come
up out of the sea to stride barefooted
across the promenade deck of the
slumbering troopship had my sen-
try seen whatever had come for him
before he had been taken

  add to all these circumstances the
fact that all hell was loose in the
watery wastes that it was now after
midnight and you will understand a
little of my feelings never before
or since have i been as frightened as
i was then i dont regard myself
as a coward nor am i ordinarily
superstitious but show me the man
who is without fear in the presence
of the unknown the utterly uncanny
and i will show you a man who has
no soul

  i whirled bumping into the ser-
geant who manfully muffled a scream
at my unexpected movement and
started almost blindly toward the
stern of the troopship as i strode
along with the sergeant at my heels
once more strange images fled across
my mind i remembered the tale of
die lorelei the maiden who lured
sailors to their death with her eery
singing and strained my eyes through
the gloom seeking shapes i feared
to see then my mind went farther
back to the years before i could
read years in which thirsty for
knowledge i studied pictures out of
old histories to satisfy my longings
for wisdom one of these pictures
came back to my mind as i hurried
aft a picture of a hideous monster
of unbelievable proportions who had
come up from behind the oceans
horizon blotting out the sunlight
long arms extended into the pictures
foreground the right hand holding


weird tales

aloft a medieval sailing vessel which
had been lifted bodily from the ocean
a fantastic picture i knew now
drawn to prove the existence of ter-
rible monsters beyond the horizon to
which as yet no caravel or galleon
had dared travel i wondered as i
strode aft why this old picture
should return to my mind at this
time and fear was at my throat again
as i walked

  i am coming oh my beloved

  the wrords high-pitched with
ecstasy came from straight ahead of
me and out of the heavy shadow
cast by a huge funnel stepped one of
my sentries just for a second as
he strode toward the starboard rail
i could see his face-and the face
was transfigured as though the man
gazed into the very soul of the per-
fect sweetheart somewhere beyond
the rail slowly step by step as
though lie would prolong the joy of
anticipation the sentry who had
hurled his rifle aside approached the
rail still with his eyes fixed on the
welter of waters overside while i
halted spellbound to watch what he
would do from out of the wraters
there came once more the tinkling of
bells and with the sound as though
the sound had been a signal a huge
shadow detached itself from the shad-
ow whence the sentry had stepped but
a moment ago and loomed high above
the luckless youth at the same time
the ship climbed high upon a monster
wave so that her starboard side
went down down until white water
came over the side-and when she
straightened again shuddering
through all of her the sentry had
vanished from well rearward of
where the man had disappeared from
out of the smother of waters there
came a single long-drawn cry-and
it was not a cry of terror not a cry
of pain but a scream of ecstasy

  hes gone sergeant i said stu-
pidly but what took him not the

wave he had but to seize the rail
to save himself

  did you see the shadow lieuten-
ant the sergeant replied

  i did not answer he knew i had
seen it

  we strode on again heading to-
ward the stern of the ship-and all
about us now over the ship on either
side of her-but never on her-there
tinkled the eery unexplainable bells

i

we stood at last in the very stern
of the troopship gazing into
the ghostly wake far below our coign
of vantage and with certain care i
followed the wake rearward with my
eyes but one could not follow it
far that was the circumstance
which impressed itself upon me
almost at once the wake died away
short off within less than a dozen
yards of the ships stern-as though
at the very moment of birth it had
been ignominiously smothered

  in a trice i understood the rea-
son and thought i understood many
things besides for like a monster
raft stretching away rearward as far
as i could see and into the darkness
beyond my vision to right and left
there followed us close to an undu-
lating mass of odorless seaweed
acres and acres of it there were ris-
ing and falling sluggishly but keep-
ing pace with the troopship through
the night and the storm came again
that sound of bells and my hair stif-
fened at the base of my skull when i
saw watching the seaweed the result
of the tinkling of the bells the sea-
weed when the bells sounded seemed
imbued suddenly with life that was
utterly and completely rampant
long tendrils of the stuff drew away
to right and left below us as though
endowed with will of their own and
these tendrils countless thousands of
them collided with other tendrils in
the mass and slithered over them
so that all the mass of the seaweed
writhed as though in torment re-
bells of oceana



sembling countless hordes of serpents
gathered together from all the evil
places of the earth-and where the
tendrils had drawn aside i could see
black water in the rift as though the
tendrils had drawn aside so that i
might see some terrible fascination
held me my eyes fixed on that space
of black water for several moments
after the tendrils of seaweed had
drawn away to right and left-and
up from the depths into the opening
came two who filled all my being
with abject terror-and something
else

  one of the two was dead i knew
on the instant for i could see his
face all white and drawn yet with
the blue lips smiling of the ill-fated
sentry who had gone over the side
before my very eyes and he had
been brought up from the depths in
the arms of-i hesitate to give the
creature a name a woman i
scarcely know yet this i do know
in the instant i looked into her eyes
raised to mine for a full minute i
understood the ecstasy which i had
read in the face of the sentry whom
she now held in her arms her
breasts nude and unashamed were
the breasts of a buxom woman
her lips as red as full-blown roses
her hair as black as the wings of a
crow a mantle of loveliness all about
her wondrous body whipping this
way and that in the storm

  her eyes swerved away from mine
and one arm shapely and snowy
raised aloft from the water-and to
my ears came again the sound of
tinkling bells once more the sea-
weed writhed and twisted pressed
forward about the ship but a single
mass of it detached itself from the
larger mass pressed close to the-
should i call her woman-and
swerved away again and the arms
of the beautiful creature were empty
instinctively i whirled about know-
ing somehow that i must move my
head before i met this creatures

eyes again and stared forward to the
shadowy portion of the promenade
whence the sentry had emerged be-
fore his plunge over the side up
the starboard side of the ship crept
a veritable wall of seaweed up to
the rail pausing there for a moment
then to the deck where it writhed
for a moment or two taking a weird
distorted shape that made me think
of a man yet which i knew was not
a man before it strode into the center
of the promenade from out of the
heart of this monstrosity there
dropped soggily a white cold figure
the second sentry had returned as
the first had done

 why why why what did
all this unbelievable terror mean

  i knew as i searched through all
my experience seeking the key to
this uncanny enigma that we were
heading westward outside the usually
traveled sea-lanes that ships seldom
if ever came this way that in seven
days we had seen not one vessel nor
even the smoke of one upon the hori-
zon why did not vessels come this
way

  but i could not answer my many
questions i could only ask them
and hope within me that they be not
answered ever nauseated by the
return of the dead sentry nude as
the first had been i closed my eyes
for a moment and when i opened
them again there was no seaweed no
monstrous shape upon the prome-
nade but even from where i stood
i could see the wet footprints-and
wondered whom next the creature of
the deep would claim from aboard
our ill-fated vessel

resolutely i drew my pistol and
returned once more toward the
stem of the vessel this creature of
the depths whatever it was had taken
life-twice whatever it was it was
mortal and whatever is mortal a bul-
let will slay but in the very act of
whirling i stopped short-for be-


weird tales

tween me and the stern of the vessel
smiling dreamily water rippling
over her nude and glorious body to
splash upon the deck stood the crea-
ture who had come up from the
depths in the wake of the ship bear-
ing the dead man in her arms my
arm fell to my side my weapon clat-
tered to the deck and as i moved
forward once more slowly a step at
a time as the sentry had done the
wondrous creature held out her drip-
ping arms and my eyes drank in all
the glorious wonder of her-from
head to-but she had no feet

  where the feet should have been
and the legs there were neither legs
nor feet but a sealv column wet and
dripping like a serpent with a wo-
mans body i screamed in terror
and unbelief but it was too late and
her arms were about me preventing
all escape but with the touch of
those arms i did not wish to struggle
i knew what had happened to the two
sentries knew the same was in pros-
pect for me yet at the moment
there seemed nothing in all the world
more worth-while than to slip over
the side into the depths with the
arms of this wondrous creature about
me

  lieutenant lieutenant for
the love of god what is happening to
you

  it was the voice of the sergeant of
the guard freighted with abysmal
terror but i did not care the
shapely strangely warm jrms of the
sea-creature were about me and the
sound of the bells unbelievably sweet
now was in my ears for me the
world had ceased to exist save for
knowledge that these two things were
true i was carried to the rail and
went over slowly without commotion
as comfortably as though i had been
riding on a couch of eiderdown-and
came to myself to know myself lost
indeed

  i was deep down whirling over and
over behind the whirling screws of

the ship holding my breath until my
lungs were nigh to bursting swim-
ming with all my might striving to
reach the surface and life-giving air
when i hadnt the slightest idea
which way was upward with all
my power i fought toward the sur-
face but my progress was slow and
dragging for there was a weight
about my knees as though arms were
clasped about them striving to hold
me down a wordless voice was in
my ears-begging beseeching and
there was something in the voice
which made my struggles seem fool-
ish and unnecessary so that i desired
never to reach the air i needed i
closed my eyes which i had opened
instinctively upon striking the water
and two lips pressed firmly against
my own-and those lips saved my life
and my reason for they were the cold
lips of a corpse with neither love nor
challenge in them i flailed out once
more and my hand caught in the line
which the steamer dragged over her
stem to measure the knots she trav-
eled all about me as i was hurled
forward now under water now with
nostrils out for a brief breathing
space the mass of seaweed rose and
fell on the heavy seas

god knows how i ever got back
aboard the troopship but i
awoke at mess-call in the morning
and sent immediately for the sergeant
of the guard

  what happened after i came back
aboard last night sergeant   i asked
abruptly

  the sergeant of the guard stared at
me as though he thought me insane

  i dont understand you he man-
aged finally

  have we finally passed through
the area of seaweed

  seaweed is the lieutenant mak-
ing sport of me were two thou-
sand miles from any land save the
ocean bottom and there aint any
bells of oceana



seaweed anywhere i dont under-
stand you

  let it pass i said when did
you last visit the sentries last night
just before midnight sir

    and were all of them at their post
of duty

  yes sir

  and what about the bells
again the sergeants puzzlement
was so genuine that i knew he did
not understand my meaning how
much of my experience had been real
how much fantasy i tried another
tack

  did you make a round of the sen-
tries after midnight

  the sergeant shook his head sheep-
ishly-it is one of the rules of guard
duty that one visit to all sentries must
take place between midnight and
morning

  then the guard hasnt been mus-
tered this morning is everyone
present you dont know then go
at once and find out

  ten minutes later the sergeant re-
turned chalk-white of face to report
that two of the guard were missing
and could not be found anywhere
aboard he told me their names-and
instantly my mind went back to the

night of uncanny happenings just
past and the two nude bodies brought
back from the deep in the arms of-
whom or what

  i never knew and to this day the
questions i have propounded have
never been answered

  but this i know there are strange
things and sounds in the sea near
the hundred and eightieth meridian
a thousand miles north of honolulu
-and this is the strangest incident
in my night of terror the clothing
which i donned next morning was
entirely dry but my hair was stiff
with salt water and there was the
tang of sea-weed in my room when i
awoke

  i looked too at the glass which
covered the port-hole beside my
bed-

  outside that glass were the
smudged prints of thin lips the blur
above them which told of a face
pressed against the glass from out-
side-as though somebody or some-
thing had tried to peer in between
nightfall and morning

  and the bells i still can hear
them in memory wrhen sometimes i
waken at sea after midnight and the
rolling and the plunging of the ship
tell me that a storm is making

 harlow he dragon and his kinsmen

 for  years and more no
 fabulous animal was more uni-
 versally accepted as really exist-
 ing than the dragon in its various
 forms the dragon which st george
 an early christian hero slew was of
 the usual type-a thick scaly body
 somewhat resembling a lizards bat-
 like wings four legs with clawed
 feet like an eagles the body tapering
 into a tail which like the tongue had
 v a sting in the end of it

   even after  a nature waiter
 though admitting that some doubted
 the existence of the dragon said that
 there were in arabia serpents
 called sirenee which have wings
 being very swift running or flying
 at pleasure and when they wound
 a man he dieth instantly these
 are supposed to be a kind of drag-
 ons    dragons are also said to
 be bred in india and africa those
 of india are much the largest
 being of incredible length and of
 these there are two kinds one living
 in the marshes which are slow of
 pace and without combs on their
 heads the other in the mountains
 which are bigger and have combs
 some are of a yellow fiery colour
 having sharp backs like saws these
 also have beards when they set
 up their scales they shine like sil-
 ver the apples of their eyes are
 as it is said precious stones and
 as bright as fire in which it is
 affirmed there is great virtue against
 many diseases their aspect is very

     

fierce and terrible    some do
affirm that the dragon is a black
colour the belly somewhat green
and very beautiful that it has a
triple row of teeth in each jaw and
very bright shining eyes that it
has also two dewlaps under the chin
which hang down of a red colour  

  pliny the old roman writer tells
of how dragons in india concealed
themselves in trees and sprang down
oil elephants fixing their teeth in
the elephants neck and sucking its
blood the elephants blood pliny
declared is very cold and was there-
fore much sought by the dragon in
hot weather one dragon could
drink all the blood in an elephants
body but was made so stupid by it
that when the elephant finally fell
from weakness the dragon was fre-
quently crushed beneath its body

  closely akin to the dragon was the
griffin whose head shoulders wings
and forefeet resembled an eagles
while the body hind legs and tail
were a lions griffins were the
monsters who guarded the deposits
of gold in the mountains of scythia
in ancient times the wyvem had
a body and feet only two some-
what like an eagles save with scales
instead of feathers bat wings and
the head and tail of a dragon the
hippogriff had four legs the fore-
part and wings were those of a grif-
fin the rear half of the body was that
of a horse a famous magician
named atlantes did his traveling on
the back of a hippogriff
he was a mild-mannered self-
eonseious young man he
talked in a steady low-pitched
voice as one who is inordinately anx-
ious to be understood as he talked
his body moved and twitched ner-
vously quite unconsciously he
shifted his weight frequently from
one foot to the other and with more
frequency a mellow pink glow suf-
fused his face and neck he was
dressed shabbily and wore glasses

  you see he said -i am quite
perplexed i am not sure whether i
am at this moment in the world of
reality or whether i am talking to
you in a dream there is a half-
chance that i am dreaming and if i
am it will be impossible for you
to carry my story further so i can
afford to be more expository

  i live in a white stone mansion
just this side of morristown it is on
the highway and lies a quarter of a
mile east of morristown on the north
side of the road there is a yellow
corrugated brick wall that runs for
about three hundred yards facing the
road the-wall is about seven feet
high and effectually isolates the es-
tate from the road on the top of
the wall runs a short cast-iron grille
about a foot high with nude winged
maidens pinioned on black fleurs-de-
lis every six feet or so at first i
thought their exposed rounded
breasts vulgar taste but they are
small figures and quite eight feet
above the ground so not easily
observed from the road

 i have been away from home a
long time mother and kate are prob-

                                  

the twilight atmosphere was
tense with romance


weird tales

ably worrying sick over my absence
it may sound queer but for the life
of me i can not find the yellow brick
wall with the nude iron maidens oh
i have been to every police precinct
but they smile as they assure me that
they are searching-then they lead
me to the door

    at present i live in a dark stuffy
flat on broome street mother and
kate are there too

  oh do not be alarmed please
listen to me i am sure i shall make
myself clear you see either the
house on broome street is a dream
and i am dreaming now or the es-
tate near morristown is a dream and
my present status is reality i am
quite confused this afternoon i shall
go again to hunt for the yellow cor-
rugated brick wall with the cast-iron
grille 

  you see i have always been what
is generally known as a day-dreamer
after one of my daily trips to the
news office i was walking slowly
homeward i walked slowly because
the atmosphere at home was not an
inducement to increase my speed and
because by walking slowly and look-
ing downward i could lose myself
facilely in the current dream i
could go home with a clear conscience
because the news had contained noth-
ing suitable i squelched a light
qualm about the position as book-
keeper at reids because i was quite
certain that the young men on wheels
would be there long before i could
walk there i had no carfare

  as i said i was walking slowly
looking downward the mental vista
that presented itself caused a pleas-
urable flutter about the heart
dressed in the trappings of a general
i was seated on a white horse from
my perch on the hill-top i could see
the drilling thousands my subordi-
nates snapped sharp commands that
were mechanically obeyed a multi-
tude of civilians watched in silent awe
the city officials stood on each side

of me and felt important because of
the juxtaposition 

  about face forr-rrd march
charge

    it was an awe-inspiring spectacle
the steel glistening and scintillating
in the noonday sun the baby
generals soldiers were the best
trained and most loyal in the world
i was whelmed with pride and im-
portance i was quite young hence
the appellation baby general

  i was beginning to feel annoyed
with myself the scene on the hill-
side began to stale let me see it be-
gan with the world war in the daily
papers back in  there was a
probability of my going engendered
in the woild war the dream was
woven ramified and exploited until
i arrived at the crux the scene on the
hillside i felt thwarted frustrated
nights i would toss about in bed
searching for a possibility of con-
tinuity it was futile the scene on
the hillside confronted me i felt
smug on my white charger the mul-
titude offered their meed   

  you must bear in mind that the
baby general dream continued for
about six months-the first three
months being creative toward the
end of the period i was searching
frantically for a new dream in the
meantime i held tenaciously to the
scene on the hillside or as is more
probable it held me

    it is a cruel axiom that with pov-
erty the baser instincts rise to the
surface if i am not dreaming at
present then i must admit that i
can not feel anything more for my
mother than the prescribed solicitude
of a son after i have searched the
highway near morristown for the yel-
low face-brick wall with cast-iron
grille bearing the nude maidens i
shall return to my flat on broome
street to face a tirade that has as-
sumed the character of the perennial
murmur of a brook now when i pass
a brook its chronic ranting maddens
the dream



me my mother l am forced to ad-
mit does not present an esthetic ap-
pearance her face is florid and
patchy and it rests squarely with
no vestige of a neck on a short squat
body

   and you-you call yourself the
man of the family your poor sister
kate standing for insults from old mr
brabin so she could keep her job-
bringing in a measly sixteen dollars
a week with which i am expected to
run a household youre a jelly-fish
nincompoop lazy neer-do--wjell i
suppose it would give you great pleas-
ure to see me go out to scrub floors
to feed your moon-calf body wake
up fool oh if your father were
alive now oh if-

  my sister kate would come in
throw a dull look at me and flop into
a chair by the table

  tonight after supper i shall
leave the inimical atmosphere of the
stuffy greasy kitchen throw myself
on the folding-bed in the parlor it
is seldom folded and lose myself in
thoughts of ruthie  ruthie has be-
come too real to be called a dream
character i must tell you about
ruthie she is a slim lovely creature
who has plighted her troth to me so
often that im beginning to worry
about its repetition ruthie has deep
brown eyes and a mass of brown curly
hair she is always dressed in white
fluffy things that seem to attest her
purity we love each other in a pure
and noble way in fact our love is the
epitome of true love for all time
there is a crux to the ruthie dream
also but i am working assiduously at
ramification i am beset with a hor-
rible fear that i can not ramify it in
any way i can not remember under
what circumstances i became ac-
quainted with my beloved as i
throw myself on the folding-bed the
scene that i shall conjure will be of
ruthie and myself parting i am
leaving to go to war i feel self-con-
scious because of the scene ruthie is

creating at the railroad station but
the feeling at my heart is too golden
and beautiful to be likened to any-
thing on this earth

  i dont want you to become im-
patient i shall come to the purpose
of my story very shortly

  i went about writing ruthie on
every occasion that presented itself
in dust in earth in snow on paper

  perhaps you can suggest a way
to prolong the ruthie dream good
god i am afraid i have arrived at
the end of the tether the scene at
the railroad station is becoming tire-
some you can picture the scene on
the station platform it is midafter-
noon of a sunny day the soldiers
have all boarded the train the train
has begun to move ruthies beau-
tiful eyes are tear-filled as she holds
tenaciously to my arm i drag her
with me as i move toward the train

  i assure you i would never tell
you this if i were certain you are
real you appreciate the nature of
my position you must understand
the character of my day-dream be-
fore you could understand the di-
lemma that i am confronted with i
do not know whether i am dreaming
now and my stay in morristown was
real or whether this is real and my
home in morristown was a dream

  you see ruthie does not possess
what is generally conceived as femi-
nine beauty no she is not beautiful
like the calm of silver moonlight ir-
radiating an expansive lake she is not
beautiful like the evening sun in a
color riot over the ocean she is not
exotically beautiful like a ponderous
yellow moon cooling the scorched
arabian desert sands ruthie is
pretty and fluttery and ingenuous
her beauty is like the silver tinkle of
little bells-like the perennial drip-
drop of a fountain in a garden on a
clear moonlit night she is not glori-
ous and riotous like the sun or mel-
low and serene like the moon but
rather like a tiny scintillating


weird tales

twinkling star-the queen of the
stars   

	   

when i came to my senses i lay
a long time staring at the win-
dow the cream curtains stirred list-
lessly under the gentle pressure of the
garden-scented breeze the evanes-
cent odor of garden flowers pervaded
the room through the curtains i
could see diaphanous white wisps of
clouds forming exotic patterns in the
blue sky as i turned my head to
study my room i felt a sharp pain at
the back of my head my mind was
too busy with other thoughts to dwell
long on that pain i noticed for one
thing that the rectangular mahog-
any table with the chinese joss book-
ends on it was familiar the rich
carpet was decorated with nondescript
floral patterns the carpet was famil-
iar-every object in the room was
familiar a quiescent soothing
thought pervaded my being this was
my room-my home i entrenched
my body deeper into the softness of
the white bedclothes and drew the
silken cover over my chin i sank my
body deep into the cool fragrance-
and purred

    have you ever watched a cat purr
when you stroked it gently along the
spine i had often wondered if a
human could feel the spontaneous
beatitude a cat feels when it purrs
well when i became sensible that my
slummy home on broome street was a
horrible nightmare-and i would
never again see my mother blowsy
and dirty-that my sister kate was
in reality prim neat and vivacious
that in short this luxury and beauty
was reality the nerves in my body
tinglingly purred

  the nightmare seemed to have en-
dured for long ages-the misery of
existence under impoverished con-
ditions had seeped into my body as
water is drawn into a sponge i had
been bloated with wretchedness now

the sponge felt supple and clean i
let my body relax i could feel my
body purring and gurgling as under
the gentle strokes of some soothing
influence

  i should have known better than
to take the dream seriously the
thought of my unfilial attitude to-
ward my mother nettled me that
there should have been such lack of
sympathy between us even in a dream
was annoying

  i sensed a presence in my room
and turtied to look a clean glori-
fied kate-my own sister kate-was
observing me solicitously she moved
silently over to me and stooped to
stroke my hair a faint evanescent
odor of perfume emanated from her
her dress came open at the bosom
revealing soft pink flesh i noted
that she was beautiful-large blue
eyes well-formed features small soft
nose with sensitive quivering nos-
trils strange but i felt contrite for
mistreating her in a dream i took
her hand in mine and squeezed it

   feel better now danny boy
it seemed ages since i had heard
her say anything sympathetic to me
i felt moved almost to tears

   it was a nasty accident my sis-
ter continued but it is not serious
you will be out of bed by tomorrow
we had dr briggs

   i must confess i managed to
say but i dont know what happened
to me enlighten me katie dear
i held her hand tightly

   oh she said rankin mis-
judged the distance between a ear
coming our way and a tree you
went kerplop clear out of the car
there was a slight cut under your
left ear-thats all youre all right
danny boy 

   we were in the locomobile

   yes of course didnt you re-
member that

   our locomobile is a light tan
i persisted
the dream



  t certainly foolish boy you
should know that by this time weve
had it almost a year rankin looked
so utterly dejected mother kept him
i shut my eyes letting my body
seep in a feeling of wondrous con-
tent i felt my chin quiver and my
eyes fill when i opened my eyes i
saw kate observing me quizzically

  tell me danny-

  	  what   i wondered if i should
 tell me everything danny boy
youve had a bad dream tell me all
about it

   well- i fell silent

  i held her left hand tightly with
her right hand she soothed my fore-
head with slow methodical strokes

     tell me everything danny boy 
she persisted

   well here goes i said dont
let it shock you too much

   i dreamed that we lived in a
miserable slummy flat in newark it
was very realistic and caused me a
great deal of pain mother was blowsy
and naggy you bristled with silent
antipathy our impoverished condi-
tion evolved an atmosphere of dull
chronic antagonism in the perennial
struggle for existence i felt unfit and
misplaced i tried katie i tried
early mornings i made the rounds
of factories and waited with other
dull-eyed applicants for the employ-
ment manager they always seemed
to pass me by by  oclock i was
sitting with the crowd at the news
office-and oh kate there was a sod-
den joy when after a few futile at-
tempts at job-hunting i found my-
self walking slowly away from the
downtown district-free to dream for
the rest of the day i fabricated
beautiful visions of dream-texture

   i came home to broome street
one day my mind aglow with a daz-
zling inspiration the steps and halls
were filthy with dust and spittle-
and the bare boards creaked and
sagged under my weight on the third
floor i pushed the door of our flat

  w t-s

  open mother was wiping her coarse
red hands on her apron you were
lying on the kitchen lounge sobbing
the scene was not unfamiliar so i
rushed unheeding into the parlor
found paper and pencil and began
to write i wrote hurriedly fever-
ishly with no thought of the com-
mercial value of my fantasy

   wearing sandals and loin-cloth
i was running with long joyous
strides along a forest trail perhaps
i was an indian runner i felt lithe
and carefree twigs and dried leaves
rustled and snapped under my feet
stooping to avoid overhanging
branches brushing insects from my
face i ran the twilight atmos-
phere was heavy and tense with ro-
mance i drank deeply of the wine-
scented air in a clearing two fig-
ures were dancing perhaps they
were pierrot and pierrette the air
hung motionless perfumed and tense
i found myself merged into the
dance ruthie was in my arms lis-
some soft and smiling we were
the only two in the clearing per-
haps we were pierrot and pierrette
we moved in wild fantastic swings
neither of us had spoken a big
round moon came out to bathe us in a
silvery glow

   then a voice from the kitchen
harsh and sibilant cut into my con-
sciousness 

    mother i tell you i wont stand
it much longer brabin grabbed me
around the waist and kissed me the
touch of his horrid lips on mine was
unbearable im going to quit ill

find another job-

    gawd and whatll we do in the
meantime tomorrows the first-

gawd well be put out-

   oh katie it was horrible hor-
rible-

    silently kate continued to soothe
my forehead with steady soft strokes

  suddenly i sat up a-quiver with
determination


weird tales

   kate tell rankin to get the ear
-the locomobile-im all right the
only thing thats the matter with me
is the dream i cant shake it off it
may seem queer but i want to go to
broome street perhaps the old house
is there if it is ill know it

   to what purpose-this trip

  to cement me to my present
mode of living the dream took hold
of me in an eery way i cant shake
it off i tell you

   very well kate assented per-
haps it is best

  ate left me alone i became sen-
tsible again of the throbbing
pain behind my left ear i pondered
on the route we would follow after we
got to newark we must find kinney
street-then left on broome to court
street yes i would know it what
a wild adventure-searching for a
house i had dreamed about

  my thoughts were interrupted by
my mother hurrying to my bed

   poor danny she gasped out of
breath kate just told me

  she was stout but it added to her
dignity she carried her weight
gracefully and withal made a charm-
ing and prepossessing matronly ap-
pearance

  no i would not be diverted my
mind was made up yes she could
come along-and kate too we could
be back for dinner it was final

  it required some effort to dress
my clothes patently of a fine texture
looked strangely unfamiliar my
mental equilibrium seemed to be
turned slightly askew by the dream-
drat the dream

  by and by we were rolling noise-
lessly along the drive the lawn
shimmered rich green in the afternoon
sun

  arrived at the gate house we
waited for hare to open the massive
doors the yellow brick wall ap-
peared formidable old hare came
hurrying rheumatically

   and how is mister daniel he
asked deferentially as we rolled out

  i chafed as we sped along the
countryside mother and kate were
obviously humoring me we reached
newark and rankin found it neces-
sary to shift gears frequently in the
traffic he often turned his head at
an inquiring angle

   yes straight ahead rankin
i sat tensely erect my emotions
screwed to a high pitch my heart
beat clamorously

   now to your left rankin this
is broome street why everything
is quite familiar-that drug-store-
that tenement-the next corner-now
stop-stop-this is the house-this is
it im sure of it

  people collected evidently at-
tracted by the expensive make of car

  in my excitement i sprang up
pointing over the collected heads
this is the house kate-mother

    then the devil got into the crowd
and they began to laugh they
pointed horny fingers at me and
laughed they leered some colored
boys started to jig pointing at me and
laughing at the same time i felt
sick and foolish i turned to mother
and kate good god they were
laughing mother kate and rankin
-pointing fingers at me-laughing

  you see something strange must
have occurred now i am looking
for the white stone mansion with the
yellow brick wall on top of the wall
runs a short cast-iron grille about a
foot high with nude winged maidens
pinioned on black fleurs-de-lis every
six feet or so i am sure i shall find
it mother and kate are worrying
over my absence

  perhaps you think i have never
lived in a white stone mansion oh

i	can prove it-i can prove it i
can show you the scar behind my left
ear

  look-look closely i am a little
confused perhaps it is behind the
right ear do you see it
men call me mad they have
labeled me a maniac and
shut me away in this grim
asylum the more i try to convince
them of the truth the more they
laugh bad i am a criminal i am
but insane i am not now incar-
cerated within madhouse walls i
will write my story and perhaps
after i have gone they will believe

  it all began last september now it
is june in a tall maple outside my
iron-barred window robins are sing-
ing to the birds it is summer nine
months ago it was summer in my
heart too nine months ago how
long it seems

  nine months ago i visited the
western hospital of that old french-
canadian city montreal and there
on a cot near the door -in the fifth

public ward i saw old matthewson
the orchid-gatherer fever was de-
vouring him and part of the time he
was delirious but during lucid
moments he told me his strange
story told me of the marvelous
flowers for which i have sold my
soul

  i laughed at him at first i remem-
ber  laughed incredulously had
not i myself for many years col-
lected orchids searched them out
from the farthest corners of the
globe certainly i had and critics
had pronounced my collection the
most excellent of any-better even
than that of jasper carrington my
most bitter rival

 old matthewson saw me laugh
saw my sneer of unbelief then with
shaking fingers he drew from be-


weird tales

neath his pillow the map and
pointed out to me the place far in
the interior of brazil where the
flowers grew and as his finger
touched the rude sketch his fore-
head contracted a look of fear came
into his pale blue eyes and from
his burning lips trembled the word
  danger   suddenly he raised him
self upon his elbow and stared in hor-
ror past me into nothingness then
uttering a sharp cry of white
orchids he fell back dead

 as a nurse came hurrying from
the other end of the ward i thrust
the paper into my coat pocket
after all the man was dead dead as
a smelt why then as he could not
use his map should not i appropriate
it i calmly listened to the anger
of the nurse who accused me of ex-
citing the patient then as she
turned again to the body i walked
quickly from the building

  next morning i returned to my
home in new york taking the map
with me that evening i spread it
before me on a table in my den and
gloated over it i studied it intent-
ly studied it till every point upon
it was firmly fixed within my mind
finally putting the chart aside i
sketched it from memory upon an-
other paper then compared the
two in delight i found my new
map was a counterpart of the orig-
inal true i had left out a few
minor details but all important fea-
tures were identical

  placing my own sketch within a
book i folded matthewsons and
put it in my pocketbook then i
went down to the collectors club

  many of the members were there
that night among others carring-
ton

  i behaved foolishly that evening
excited by my discovery i drank
deeply and became badly intoxi-
cated during a discussion with
carrington regarding the merits of

our collections i boasted of my new
find

  carrington laughed contemptuous-
ly youre dreaming man or
rather-you re drunk  

  taking out the map i waved it
dramatically

 drunk am i i exclaimed
theres the map to prove what ive
told you oh no you dont-as
he reached for it-the secrets
mine mine alone im the only
white man who knows where those
orchids are

  carringtons eyes sparkled with
desire and for a moment he ap-
peared almost ready to assault me
then with a muttered oath he
turned away

  flushed with my triumph i called
loudly for another drink then for
another and another

  at an early hour next morning i
staggered to a couch in an inner
room and falling upon it lost con-
sciousness

ithen i opened my eyes i re-
  membered what a fool i had
made of myself the night before i
could not recall all the idiotic things
i had done but i could remember
enough then i thought of my map
i felt for my pocketbook what a
relief when my fingers touched it

 reassured i went back to my
house and entering my den locked
the door i opened the pocketbook
the map was gone

  for several minutes i paced the
room wildly cursing though i had
no proof i was certain that carring-
ton had stolen my chart

  then i laughed after all i still
had a reliable map i crossed to the
table and opened the book yes
there lay my new map just as i had
left it

  i went to the phone intending to
enter a complaint at the club then

i	paused such a proceeding would
be useless most of the members
white orchids



were good friends of carringtons
and many were my personal enemies
if i spread the news of my loss i
should gain nothing and besides i
should make a laughing-stock of
myself

  i wished however to learn what
carrington was doing so i rang
him up a servant answered a new
servant who did not recognize my
voice i asked to speak to her mas-
ter she told me that mr carring-
ton had left that morning for his
house at jacksonville no-she
didnt know how long hed be away

  but i had found out enough i
knew why carrington had gone to
jacksonville it was there that his
powerful biplane was housed

  i made a rapid calculation car-
ringtons airplane had been used in
a long non-stop flight a few weeks
before and would need a thorough
overhauling before it would be fit for
service he could scarcely have it
ready before a fortnight

  then too an accident might delay
him nor could he depend upon find-
ing a good landing-place in those
south american jungles

  i consulted shipping lists the
fast steamer bolivia was to clear for
para brazil that very afternoon

  i	acted immediately when the
bolivia sailed i was aboard

t eaving the steamer at para 

  ii	procured an indian guide and a
swift motor-boat and started up the
amazon

  from the outset disaster attended
me when near the place where i
intended leaving the boat we ran
against a submerged rock being
very near land we managed to save
both our lives and part of our sup-
plies including my rifle and several
boxes of cartridges but the boat
sank before we could get out every-
thing nearly all of my collecting
paraphernalia went to the bottom
all i had left were a few large

manila envelopes such as i used for
pressing flowers

  this was bad enough but worse
was to come on the third day after
we had left the river and struck in-
land came tragedy we were push-
ing our way through dense jungle
when suddenly my young native
who was some distance ahead of me
uttered a despairing shriek run-
ning forward with rifle in hand i
was horrified to see the poor lad in
the embrace of a huge anaconda
anchored by its tail to a small tree
at close range i discharged the con-
tents of my heavy rifle into the boas
head it sank to the ground its
coils spasmodically tightened then
it unrolled and releasing its victim
thrashed about in its death agony

 knowing i had nothing more to
fear from the big snake i turned my
attention to the native the poor
fellow was already nearly dead
that awful hug had crushed his ribs
and driving them against his lungs
had forced the breath from his body
even as i bent over him the last
spark of life flickered out

  never shall i forget the despair-
ing scream of my unlucky guide
when the sinuous coils caught him
nor the sight of his broken squeezed
body no nor the look of anguish
pictured upon his dead face

  i buried my guide where he lay
then after consulting my map i
continued my journey

  ten days later i knew that if map
and compass had not misled me i
must surely be near the place of the
orchids my heart tingling with ex-
citement i hastened on

  above me on the tree branches
small green monkeys chattered in-
dignation at my intrusion while
gaudily-feathered parrots shrilled
insults

  i scarcely noticed these so intent
were my thoughts upon the flowers

 where is carrington i won-
dered perhaps already he had


weird tales

reached his objective perhaps
already he had won the rich prize

 spurred by the unwelcome
thought i quickened my pace

  as i advanced i saw the forest
becoming more open and felt cer-
tain that i was nearing the end of
my quest

  then suddenly emerging from the
shade of the forest into clear sun-
light i gasped in amazement

  no the map had not lied there
not more than a hundred yards in
front of me were the orchids-hun-
dreds of them-in full bloom

 and such orchids in my most
fantastic dreams i had never imag-
ined anything so beautiful they
were white of a spotless tint of
whiteness that shamed all other
colorings petals were white even
the leaves and bodies of the plants
were of the same shade white or-
chids 

  at first feasting my eyes upon the
orchids i saw nothing more then
as my gaze dropped upon something
lying on the ground a few yards
from the flowers i sprang involun-
tarily back the white sun-bleached
something had once been a living
man

  glaneing about my terrified eyes
saw other things of a similar nature
in all scattered about near the or-
chids i counted a full score of skele-
tons-every one a humans

  i now recalled the dark warning
that old mathewson had uttered just
as life was leaving him

 what meant these flesh-bared
bones in this lovely flower garden
look where i might i could see
nothing which appeared dangerous
yet the skeletons showed that dan-
ger threatened

  then again i looked at the white
orchids and desire gripped me
momentarily forgetting the grim
spectacle of the dead men i ran
with outstreatched hands toward
the flowers

  as i drew nearer them i became
aware of a sweet powerful seent
the aroma of it filled my nostrils
the whole atmosphere seemed cloud-
ed with the subtle perfume i was
running no longer instead i was
drunkenly staggering from side to
side the force of the perfume was
overcoming me my senses were reel-
ing

  now i realized the meaning of the
danger yet despite this my desire
for the orchids drove me on thun-
der rolled within my brain my eyes
were darkening breath was leaving
me yet still i stumbled onward

  i had been about three hundred
feet from the orchids when i had
started now i was a scant hundred
but my powers of endurance were
rapidly diminishing my very life
seemed ebbing from me and final-
ly i fell headlong

 for some minutes i lay dazed
then with dogged effort again went
forward creeping upon hands and
knees

  after covering a few feet in this
manner my limbs refused to func-
tion and i fell again stretched at
full length on the ground my fast-
blinding eyes fixed covetously upon
the orchids

  i knew now that i could not reach
them i had crossed little more than
two-thirds of the distance and
already was almost lifeless what
then would be the result if i at-
tempted to advance farther

  i hated to go back but to remain
meant death yet the perfume so
dangerously sweet was luring me on
every impulse in my body mind and
soul clamored to me to go onward
but common sense told me to retreat
while there was time

 so i commenced my backward
journey too exhausted to rise i
crawled weakly toward security

  for minutes at a time strength de-
serted me and i lay motionless un-
able to movea single muscle
white orchids



  then my powers would return for
a brief period and again i would re-
sume the fight my granite-formed
will urged me on had it not been
for that i must have lain down and
let the poisonous breath of the or-
chids destroy me

  but that strong will saved me and
at length i again reached the edge
of the forest rolling beneath the
cooling shade of a tree i lay still

ttow long i lay there i do not
know but it was doubtless sev-
eral hours

  suddenly i heard a sound that i
recognized a sound apart from the
jungle noises-the drone of a motor

  i turned my gaze upward was i
dreaming i wondered or was that
big humming thing high above me
in the sky really an airplane then
i remembered carrington

  eagerly i watched the machine
was dropping lower evidently its
pilot had seen the flowers he vol-
planed down to a perfect landing
on the other side of the orchid gar-
den

  the pilot stepped out and at sight
of him my heart thrilled there
could be no mistaking that stalwart
figure

  while i looked carrington started
toward the flowers

  watching my rival i could see
how i myself must have behaved
i smiled grimly as carringtons
stride slackened and his steps be-
came uncertain and laughed aloud
when he began to sway from side to
side

  at last carrington fell even as i
had done and again as i had done
he crept forward on all fours

  i now expected to see carrington
overpowered by the heady perfume
and believed he would soon abandon
his attempt

  but after some moments i saw
in mortification that he was evi-
dently stronger than i and that

where i had failed he might suc-
ceed

  still he held to his course gradual-
ly inch by inch cutting down the
distance between him and the or-
chids

  now only ten feet separated him
from the flowers

  with one last desperate effort
carrington flung himself forward
seizing the nearest orchid-plant he
tore it from the ground then he
sank unconscious beside the flowers

  i watched expecting each instant
to see him begin his return trip
but he remained motionless and
finally i realized that the scent had
completely overpowered him and if
he should lie there many minutes
longer he would surely die and
then i made a decision

  frantically i looked about but
could see nothing to aid me in my
purpose then i thought of the air-
plane and hurried over to it in the
machine i found what i had hoped
for-a coil of rope

  unrolling it i saw i had about
one hundred and twenty feet of
cord

  i set quickly at work and a few
moments later held a serviceable-
looking lasso

  then drawing a long breath i
stepped into the poison-charged
area

  several times the dreadful pei-
fume almost overcame me but final-
ly i arrived within about a hundred
feet of carrington

  whirling the lariat above my
head i east straight and true sped
the noose encircling my rival just
below his shoulders carefully i
drew the rope tighter with a sigh
of relief i felt the slack grow less
i began to walk backward pulling
carrington after me soon both of
us were beyond reach of the deadly
perfume

  still carrington held the white or-
chid clutched fiercely in his hand i


weird tales

took hold of the plant and tried to
pull it from him his clenched fin-
gers were like a vise then i used
both hands and putting forth all
my strength bent back the rigid fin-
gers a moment more and the won-
derful orchid was in my possession
i cried aloud with joy i gazed upon
it in rapture

  at last carefully laying the flower
aside i again turned to carrington
my noose was still drawn tight about
his body his eyes were closed i
began to fear that he was already
dead i caught him by the shoulders
and shook him roughly he wriggled
weakly in my grasp his eyes slowly
opened i saw that he recognized me
he opened his mouth tried to speak
but could not

  i smiled cruelly i picked up the
white orchid and held it above him
at sight of it passionate desire filled
his eyes he reached for it painfully
i laughed and drew it away his
almost powerless arm dropped back
he groaned

 i laughed again bending over
him i said mockingly

 you want white orchids car-
rington then you shall have them
i will give them to you-i will give
you to them

  catching hold of the rope i sav-
agely dragged him toward the flow-
ers i drew him far within the poi-
son belt drew him till i felt myself
weakening till my tortured lungs
crying for air hammered at my ribs
then i left him

  all this time carrington had said
nothing though he fully realized
what was happening that is his
lips had not spoken but what a
curse his cold gray eyes had uttered
they had bored me through and
through

  but when i returned to the orchid
any faint qualms of conscience left
me i would have killed another
man if need were-aye a score a
hundred-to obtain the flower from

infancy i had loved flowers almost
worshiped them but this white
orchid-words can not describe it

  i held the flower a long time in
spellbound admiration i would have
liked to take the plant intact to
north america but i knew this
would be impossible could i have
used the airplane i might have pre-
served the orchid alive but unfor-
tunately i had never learned to
operate such a machine

  but the flower even if pressed
would excite the envy of other col-
lectors in my pocket were the
manila envelopes taking one out
i carefully broke off a big blossom
and placed it inside i sealed the
envelope then returned it to my
pocket and then going toward the
orchids i tossed the blossom-raped
plant in the direction of my victim

  going back to the edge of the
woods i picked up my rifle which
i had laid down when attempting to
secure the orchids and after casting
one last look at flowers skeletons
and carrington i entered the jungle

  i was now faint with hunger but
the forest teemed with game an
hour later i killed a peccary built a
fire and roasted it then i heaped
on wood and made a big blaze to
keep off wild beasts completely
worn out by the days excitement i
lay down by the fire and fell asleep

tjakly in the morning i awoke and
- continued my way back toward
the river

  the fourth afternoon of my jour-
ney back i felt sharp pains shoot-
ing through my head i staggered
on but rapidly my strength forsook
me fever had gripped me

  at last my senses left me i be-
came delirious what i did i know
not

  when i came to myself i found
myself in a boat on the amazon in
the company of a party of american
hunters these told me that they
white orchids



had found me burning with fever
helpless in the jungle that they
had done everything within their
power to aid my recovery and were
now taking me back to civilization

  my first thought was of my orchid
i searched my pocket for the en-
velope found it gone i demanded
it they told me they had seen noth-
ing of it that when they had found
me i had not so much as a rifle or
compass with me

  i refused to believe my rescuers
i became violent i cursed them for
a lot of robbers my excitement
raised my temperature brought on
a relapse again i lost my mind

  of course i do not remember what
happened then but have been told
that the hunters brought me to para
where they placed me in the care of
an american doctor he recognized
me and did everything possible for
me gradually i recovered from the
fever but for a long time my mind
was a blank the doctor took me
back to new york and some weeks
later i regained my memory

  with remembrance there came a
strange feeling i was sorry i had
killed carrington more than sorry
i hated myself for having done so
had i still possessed the orchid per-
haps i might not have felt remorse-
ful but its loss had in a measure
softened me and i realized what an
awful thing i had done

  at last the strain became too great
to bear i felt that even death
would be preferable to my soul-an-
guish so i went to the chief of police
and told my story he only laughed
at me declared that before leaving
america carrington had told the
press he was attempting a non-stop
flight across the atlantic that his
flight had been unsuccessful and the
accepted belief was that he had
fallen into the sea

  as for my own tale the chief con-
sidered it utterly absurd he hinted
that i was suffering from hallucina-

tions i grew angry a red film
danced before my eyes i struck him
in the face

  it was then that they called me
mad then that they gave me a ma-
niacs number and dragged me to
this horrible asylum death i would
not have minded but this-

  since coming here i have been
tormented with awful visions in
my dreams and often when awake
i have again seen those flowers of
hell-and carrington i have seen
his cursing gray eyes malignantly
fixed upon me

  i know that if i remain longer in
this lonely dismal madhouse i shall
indeed become insane but i will
not remain

  this morning i discovered some-
thing one of the iron bars on my
window is loose not very loose but
enough so i can pull it out the
maple tree where the birds are sing-
ing is quite near the window and
one of the branches is within easy
reach tonight when all is still and
the guards are asleep i will escape
i have friends in the outer world
who will hide me they will give me
money and help me to get away to
some other country and perhaps
when i am out in the busy world
again i shall not mind those cursing
eyes shall not behold such visions
so often tonight i will escape


  extract from the report of charles
warren superintendent of the asy-
lum

  yesterday afternoon inmate no 
asked for pencil and paper all the after-
noon he wrote and till nearly dark this
morning when i entered his room i found
it empty the pile of paper and pencil lay
on the table but inmate no  had gone
a brief examination showed that he had
wrenelied a bar from his window and
crawled through the opening going to the
window i looked out inmate no  was
lying on the ground twenty feet below a
broken branch lying beside him explained
what had happened going downstairs i
went out and examined the body inmate
no  was dead his neck was broken
a shorty strange tale is

when the dead
return

by percy b prior

without a doubt it is very
disconcerting to meet a dead
man particularly if he
chances to have been your husband

  in the circumstance it is no won-
der that marian screamed

  as it was midday and on broad-
way the scream attracted a good deal
of attention and with one exception
everyone in the vicinity rushed to-
ward marian who was charming
enough to merit the fullest sympathy
the one exception walked quickly
round the comer of john street and
vanished he had a reason for doing
this he was a dead man

 normally marian might have
thought there had been some mistake
regarding her late husbands demise
but this was hardly possible he had
died in bed and in her presence fur-
thermore the medical man dr
henry delware who had also been
present could doubtless swear that
the dead man had shuffled off his
mortal coil

  marian was twenty-two when she
became a widow it was a year later
when she screamed on broadway and
by that time she was no longer mrs
creed relict of the late mark creed

 she had become mrs james
turner

 that was one reason why her
scream had such a stricken note it
becomes really embarrassing to en-
counter a dead husband when one
has no further use for him

    

  what made the matter more dis-
concerting and argued against the
chance of delusion or of the dead
mans having a double was the fact
that the newspapers had recently
contained a number of circumstantial
accounts of dead people having been
seen there was a veritable epidemic
of apparitions

  a psychic committee had formed
itself to collate and record the evi-
dence and had investigated such inci-
dents as that of arthur johnson age
twenty-four who had died suddenly
in a public city park some six
months later he had been seen by
both his mother and sister near their
residence and when they had tried
to speak to him he had fled and
boarded a street-car post-haste

  then there was mrs tumley seen
by her son leaving her favorite seat
in a well-known new york picture
palace he had tried to trace her in
the crowd but had failed that was
four months after her death

  strangest of all however was the
case of felix malheur the french
chef who had been fatally stabbed
in the neck by henri marzot a mali-
cious deed for which marzot went to
the electric chair

 some seven months had elapsed
when a man convincingly identified
as malheur and having a scar on his
neck exactly similar to the fatal
wound was arrested for vagrancy
he swore that he was not malheur
when the dead return



but would give no particulars of
himself the one point of doubt in
this case was the fact that the ar-
rested man had a scar on his
chest whereas no such mark was
mentioned in the description of the
deceased malheur

  with these circumstances in mind
it is not surprizing that marian
turner screamed when she caught
sight of her dead first husband whom
she had married when she was but
eighteen and whose doglike devotion
she had found irritating rather than
otherwise and whom she had done
her best to forget since she had been
married to her wonderful james
turner

  the instant she screamed however
she realized that the position con-
tained embarrassments so when the
passers-by crowded around her she
apologized

  its all right she explained
im sorry to be so silly but i was
sure that car was going to run over
that little child and she pointed
to the scene of a fictitious narrow
escape

  that evening she told her husband
of the apparition and together they
consulted dr delware as to possible
pre-natal effects of such a shock on a
child-to-be he reassured them but
they were still a little troubled as to
the legal status of children if dead
first husbands were going to make a
practise of returning to life

tt was at the same time that the
authorities in further investiga-
tion of the malheur affair decided to
exhume the murdered mans body
the grave was opened it contained
an empty coffin malheur was miss-
ing

  this made it look as though marzot
had been executed under false pre-
tenses though it was admittedly
rather late to make amends

  even after this the arrested va-

grant still denied that he was the
dead man and he was released after
a short detention thereupon he
vanished

  following this exhumation the
undertaking firm of interments
inc which had carried out the last
rites on the murdered man was inter-
viewed by detective bowler who had
charge of the case mr marlow
who seemed to be the whole firm
could offer no explanation

  but it so chanced that this mr
marlow was unpopular among the
undertaking fraternity a short
while previously he had been strug-
gling along small suburban and
almost bankrupt then without ap-
parent reason he had burst forth in a
blaze of advertisements as inter-
ments inc and had taken a large
establishment in the heart of new
york it was then that he became
unpopular he gave cut-rates for
funerals and a facetious competitor
even remarked that he would next be
introducing a cash-and-carry system
to the profession

  this unpopularity led to gossip
and it was then noticed that quite a
number of the alleged apparitions
were of people who had been inani-
mate patrons of interments inc that
fact combined with malheurs empty
coffin furthered the police investiga-
tion and eventually established the
fact that not merely several but
every one of the apparitions had been
buried by interments inc

  among other people interviewed
by detective bowler during these in-
quiries was marian turner not be-
cause there was any suspicion that
she had seen her dead husband but
because his funeral had left the
mortuary chapel of interments inc
instead of his late residence

  mrs turner stated that she had
actually desired the cortege to leave
the house but that mr marlow had
been so insistent that in the end she


weird tales

had agreed to its leaving his prem-
ises

  following this detective bowler
consulted the register of companies
and found that marlow was only
a nominal shareholder in the firm
virtually all the shares being in the
name of one henry delware medical
practitioner   

  before doing anything further the
officer decided to consult his chief
but about  oclock that night a
telephone message asked him to call
immediately at the residence of mr
james turner

  there he heard that mrs turner
had seen her first husband supposed
to be dead as a very substantial
apparition in broadway a few days
previously also that a second ap-
parition had occurred scarcely an
hour since mr turner explaining
this stated that he and his wife had
retired about  oclock but had not
switched off the light it was a
sultry evening and although the
blinds were drawn one window had
been left open suddenly mrs
turner had screamed and pointed to
this window her husband looking
quickly round had seen the blind
move jumping up he had rushed
outside to see a figure vanish through
the side gate but though he gave
chase the figure eluded him

the morning papers recorded
nothing of this they had
something much more startling

mysterious crime

         dr delware murdered

  assailant attempts suicide

  the details showed that the doctor
had received an urgent call toward
midnight at his residence and going
down had admitted someone to his
surgery a few minutes later his
wife heard a strange voice loud and

angry and two shots had immediate-
ly followed running downstairs she
found the doctor lying on the floor
dead and a strange man lying beside
him with a terrible wound in his
neck the doctor had been shot
through the heart detective bowler
it was stated had the case in hand

  the evening papers were able to go
one better and print verbatim in
cold official phrases the dying dep-
ositions of the wounded man who had
since succumbed

  my name is mark creed about a year
ago i died that is i became unconscious
and awoke to find dr delware standing
beside an operating-table on which i was
securely strapped he had previously been
attending me in my home he told me i
had died and that he had brought me back
to life he made me swear that i would
not reveal myself to anyone not even my
wife he said his experiments must be
secret for a while yet he said he would
not let me live unless i promised i
promised

  after that he treated me for about six
months in a sanatorium it took about an
hours ride to get to it i dont know
where it was the car was closed when
he discharged me from there he made me
promise again i would not see my wife he
told me she had married again and that
she was now very happy

  a few days ago i saw her on broadway
after that i could not keep my promise
i loitered about the house hoping to see
her last night i peeped beneath the win-
dow-blind that made me mad they saw
me and a man gave chase i got away
among some trees i then went to dr del-
ware i cursed mm i cursed him for
bringing me back to such a life of torment
then i shot him

  the man had died almost immedi-
ately after signing this statement
subsequent investigation at the doc-
tors surgery seemed to confirm quite
clearly that he had been resuscitating
the dead apparently by the hypo-
dermic injection of some unknown
drug soon after death followed by a
surgical operation and actual mas-
sage of the heart probably under an
electrical impetus

  the reason for his association with
interments inc is plain he had
financed the company and attracted
when the dead return



business by reduced rates in order to
get possession of subjects for his ex-
periments one of the most grisly
business associations on record

  the various apparitions were thus
explained and some strange reunions
resulted

  but they are not likely to recur
dr delwares astounding secret died
with him and marian turner at least
will probably agree that it is just as
well

  a dead husband is such an em-
barrassing thing to be at large

a short ghost-story

the sleepers

  by august w derleth

itt-ihat story began the man
with the gold spectacles
a crossing his legs reminds
me of an odd incident that befell me
just last year

  the other three men moved closer
around the fireplace and looked over
at him expectantly the man with
the gold spectacles repeated his state-
ment unnoticed by them a thin lit-
tle man clad in a blue suit with brass
buttons slid onto the fifth seat some-
what back in the shadows the in-
quisitive flames in the fireplace
leaped higher to light up the face of
the newcomer but the effort was too
much for them and they sank back
exhausted the four men did not see
him

    it was last summer i was at the
time in hollywood working with the
director of my latest book which was
being filmed when my publisher in
chicago wired me to come to him at
once the matter was urgent he
stated somewhat testily i wired
back that i would come immediately
the train i took was the midnight

express when i called for my
ticket every pullman was filled to
capacity certainly thought i i am
not going to be cheated out of a
nights rest merely because the pull-
man cars are all filled to capacity
so i clamored loudly for a pullman
i was not alone in my demand for a
pompous salesman who had pur-
chased his ticket after i had pro-
cured mine added his voice to mine
at length another pullman was add-
ed had it not been for the hullaba-
loo the salesman and i raised the
incident i am about to relate would
never have happened

  it being shortly after midnight
i wanted to retire i left the sales-
man smoking out on the rear plat-
form of our car and i went into the
extra pullman my berth was lower
seven and i went dircctly over to
that number and pulled the curtains
aside but i shut them again as
quickly as i had opened them for
a man lay in my berth sleeping
peacefully i was indignant that the
officials should cause such an error


weird tales

i called for the porter who came in
as fast as his sleeping feet would
carry him

  said i when the negro had come
abreast of me sam theres a man in
my berth

  he grinned foolishly and pulled
the curtains slightly aside indeed
suh indeed there is very unfortu-
nate suh and thas a fac

   sam i answered go and get
me the pullman conductor and dont
you dare to come back without him
 indeed i will suh

  after what seemed a wholly un-
necessary interval sam returned with
the pullman conductor when the
conductor stepped into the car he
asked are you mccarthy yes
said i im mccarthy h p mc-
carthy yes said i again h p
mccarthy  he came up to me
sam tells me that you claim that
your berth is occupied lower seven
was assigned to h p mccarthy and
to no one else as a matter of fact
there are only two people in this ex-
tra car you and a salesman c e
schweers

   is that right said i it an-
noyed me that the conductor took
so much for granted he had never
even peeped into the berth and al-
ready he was turning to go just a
minute mr schweers is out on the
platform mr mccarthy is right
here yours truly and i say that
theres a man in lower seven and
i pulled aside the curtain and the
conductor looked in and saw the man
there it wounded his pride to find
that he was wrong and so he called
loudly to the sleeping man but the
man didnt move so he went over
to him and reached his hand in to
shake the sleeper

  now i couldnt see what hap-
pened but i was staring right into
the conductors face and i saw his
expression change so rapidly that i
thought he was going to faint his

face went white altogether he
pulled his hand out quickly- as if he
had been touching a hot iron and
then he pushed the curtains wide
apart to admit as much light as pos-
sible then he looked in again all
the time i could see the man lying
there in the light admitted by the
widely opened curtains i said noth-
ing he turned to me and pointed
at the sleeper mccarthy reach in
there and touch him

  i thought it was an odd request
but i did it and ill wager any
amount that my face went as white
as his did for i swear that i saw
that man there with the coverlet
turned back at his shoulders i saw
that but my hand felt the undis-
turbed smoothness of the coverlet
and as i looked my hand went
straight through the man sam left
by one door as mr schweers came in
by the other the conductor and i
stood in the aisle staring stupidly at
the sleeper in my berth

  a smothered exclamation from
schweers caused us to turn to him
he stood before berth three the low-
er staring at something we knew
what he would say before he said it
theres a man in my berth

  the conductor stared at him i
stared at him he turned to the
conductor well what are you go-
ing to do about it im not paying
for a filled berth feel him the
conductor stammered yes said i
feel him he looked oddly at us
but obediently he reached in to feel
him and shortly there were three
white-faced people in the aisle of the
extra pullman all staring stupidly at
a man sleeping in the berth of a pull-
man car

   by god said the conductor
with effort theres some mystery in
this a fact which had not escaped
the notice of any of us he moved
resolutely to berth six and pulled
aside the curtains and there lay a
the sleepers



woman sleeping and again what we
saw we could not feel and the
three of us made the rounds and
every berth upper and lower was
occupied by a man woman or child
and we came back to berth seven and
stood there staring at the sleeper

  and while we stood there the
door opened at the end of the car
and a thin little man who wore a
conductors blue suit with brass but-
tons walked in and looked nervously
around he had the attitude as of
being summoned and looking for
whoever had summoned him  

  not so mr mccarthy the con-
ductor had a premonition that all
was not well and he came into the
pullman to justify or destroy that
premonition it was the little man
the newcomer who had spoken but
no one seemed to have heard him

  but we didnt stare very much
longer continued the man with the
gold spectacles for suddenly the
thin little conductor that had entered
vanished in the side of the pullman
car and when we turned back to look
at the sleepers we saw only the un-
rumpled spreads on our beds

    immediately the conductor rushed
out onto the rear platform mr
schweers and i followed him we
were going round the famous horse-
shoe curve the country was all
radiant in the bright moonlight

  the conductor turned to us do
either of you know what happened
here at this spot one year ago today
no said schweers i cant think of
anything i too was forced to shake
my head what returned the con-

ductor have both of you forgotten
the famous midnight express wreck
of last august  of course we
hadnt it happened on that spot
just a little way back there in the
moonlight on a night just like this
seventy-seven people died in that
wreck this car is one that was sal-
vaged from the wreckage and was re-
built this is its first trip in its re-
built form but the people in the
berths interrupted schweers yes
those people in the berths you
noticed they all disappeared on the
spot of the accident didnt they
well figure it out for yourselves
gentlemen and with that he went
back to his post

  and thats what i say to you
gentlemen figure it all out for your-
selves were those sleepers or
werent they for my part i am
convinced  

  there was a meditative silence
then the man with the gold spec-
tacles spoke again

  by the way didnt one of you
gentlemen say something about a
premonition the phantom conductor
had i thought someone said some-
thing about it but as i recollect the
accident the conductor was killed at
once so you couldnt possible know
how he felt before the accident
didnt anyone say something

  and all of the men turned to the
fifth chair upon which the thin lit-
tle man in the faded blue conductors
suit with brass buttons had been sit-
ting there was no answer

  and the firelight flickered on the
bolt of the locked door

chapter 

up the stair

when we entered the broad
clearing of the plaza we
found it almost entirely de-
serted above us loomed the wind-
ing spiral stair and where that stair
touched the pits floor we saw the
blaze of ruddy light that illuminated
the high barred gate of the stair
keeping well within the shadows we
passed toward the farther edge of the
plaza and in the darkness there lan-
tin and i took up our position di-
rectly beneath the lowest curve of the
spiral stairway which hung in the air
some thirty feet above our heads
even where we stood we could hear
the tramp of feet around the stairs
curve as guards came and went
constantly patrolling the lower part
of the airy pathway and too we
heard the chatter and broken laugh-
ter of the other guards massed in-
side the gate

  speaking in whispers denham
said be ready to make your at-


tempt at any moment now but be
sure that all the guards on the stair
have come down to the gateway be-
fore you try it

  if we get out and come back with
aid i said rapidly where will
we find you   

  he reflected for a moment then
said you know that tall barreks-
building at the northern edge of the
pit right under the wall

  the one that is roofed i asked
and he nodded yes thats the one
well we four will spend all our
nights on that roof from now on you
could come straight down the shaft
in your flying-car and pick us up
from that roof in the darkness with-
out the knowledge of any here in the
pit but first go and get aid from
the people of kom as we planned  
and cannell said lantin
you will look for him

  never fear answered dalord
well find him for you

  the calm voice of fabrius broke
into our speech it is time to do our
part at the gate he said to denham
and the englishman nodded good-
bye he told us i know youll do
your best a warm hand-clasp
from each and then they had slipped
away into the shadows

  for a minute or so lantin and i
stood silent listening to the tramp
of feet on the stair above us and then
a sudden high-pitched cry broke on
our ears from the center of the plaza
it was dalords voice and he was
shouting at the top of his lungs out

 this story began in wkiro talks for october
the time-raider



comrades out we are to be loosed
on kom tonight

  the cry rang out over the silent
city and then was repeated but
louder the frenchmans three
friends adding their voices to his
there was an uneasy murmur from
the guards at the gate and one among
them called to the frenchman whom
they could not see in the darkness
to cease his shouting

  he went on with the cry unheed-
ing and now out of the buildings
along the branching streets men were
pouring running toward the plaza
they heard dalords cry and took
it up thinking that his statement was
a true one and repeating it

  loose us on kom tonight they
bellowed rushing toward the gate of
the stair and pressing against it
away across the great clearing we
saw a sea of faces around the ruddy
lighted gate pressing against it and
against the high wall that balus-
traded the stairs length for the first
few yards and from all around
from all of the nine branching streets
came others sword in hand afire to
be led out to loot the city whose riches
had been many times described to
them

  they beat against the barred gate
in one buffeting wave of solid hu-
manity in eager hope of freedom and
pillage their cry rose up like that
of a single vast voice but in a thou-
sand different tongues

  loose us tonight loose us on
kom tonight

  there were anxious cries from the
guards on the stair as the great mob
battered at the gate those of the
guards who patrolled the stairs up-
per part ran down swiftly to aid their
fellows in holding the gate it was
this that lantin and i awaited and
at once i grasped the metal grappling-
hook whirled it round my head by
the attached rope and then sent it
hurtling through the air toward the
edge of the stair above us

  it struck the outside of the stairs
low wall with a loud clang that
brought my heart to my throat and
that i feared would attract the atten-
tion of the guards at the gate even
over the clamor of the crowd but
the hook had not caught and fell
down beside me

  before i could throw it again there
was a warning whisper from lantin
and in a moment a solid group of
some fifty men rushed by us heading
toward the riot at the gate news of
which had evidently penetrated to
the citys farthest reaches they
raced by not seeing us in the dark-
ness and after them came four or
five single stragglers who likewise
passed us without stopping then
the coast again being clear for the
moment i slung up the hook again
with more force than before and felt
a throb of relief when it caught slid
a little along the edge of the stair-
wall and then caught again

  i tried the rope hastily but it held
firm so i hastily began to climb up
it by means of the thick knots along
its length scrambling up with pan-
icky swiftness i reached the rail
pulled myself over and lay gasping
for a moment on the stair then
leaning over the rail i signaled to
lantin whom i could see but dimly
in the darkness bracing myself
against the wall of the stair i pulled
in the rope until after a seeming eter-
nity my friends head appeared above
the wall he scrambled over and
then winding the rope around my
body and tossing the hook as far
away as possible i stood for a mo-
ment motionless

  across the plaza and below us was
the gate flooded with crimson light
and alive with activity the mobs of
the citys dwellers were pressing
against the gate while the guards
were repelling them by thrusting
through the bars with their long
spears and from all the long streets
that stretched away into the darkness


weird tales

there came the sound of many run-
ning feet and the cries of excited
men certainly the riot which our
friends had kindled to aid us was no
mean one

a moment only i watched the scenc
below then turned and with lan-
tin beside me began the long climb
up the spiral stair

  as we toiled up along the steeply
slanting spiral the clamor at the
gates below gradually lessened in vol-
ume as we drew away from it that
the riot below had not yet been
quelled though was evident for be-
fore we had been on the stair ten min-
utes a tiny beam of blue light flashed
out at the gate a narrow little shaft
of azure light that clove up to the
shaft above its and seemed to stab
straight up to the metal cover of that
shaft

  i remembered denhams words con-
cerning the signaling of the guards
and wondered if that was the cause
of the little light in a minute it
vanished but as we raced on up
around the great spiral a faint sound
came down to us from far above a
grating clash of metal that we could
barely hear

    the temple floor  i cried to
lantin theyve swung it aside
theyve uncovered the shaft of the
stairway

  he did not answer out of breath
from the toilsome climb before many
more minutes had passed we had
progressed half-way from the floor of
the cavern to its roof up the stair
abruptly something hissed down
from above through the circle of the
spiral stair the hissing was repeated
and now i saw that it had been caused
by a number of thick ropes that had
been dropped from above and that
now swung free at the center of the
stairways spiral

  i grasped lantin flung myself flat
on the stair pulling him down with
me and not a moment too soon for

peering cautiously over the low wall
i saw dark shapes flashing down
along those swinging cables in long
strings one after another when
they had passed we jumped to our
feet and sped on

  the guards from above i told
my companion lets hope that all
above have gone down

  on we raced around and around
the spiral ever upward the sound
of the riot in the pit had faded from
our ears by now and we came to the
roof of the cavern and the shaft that
pierced it on we went the wall of
the shaft on our left side now and
we hugged that wall closely as wc
sped up the narrow pathway

  i judged that we had traversed
two-thirds of the stairs length when
lantin suddenly halted when i
turned he held up a warning hand
listening intently

 hear it he asked in a low
voice

  i listened tensely and in a moment
heard the sound that had halted him
it was a rhythmic regular thudding
and seemed to come from a point
some distance above us and across
the shaft from us

 the guards he wrhispered
some of them are coming down the
stair

  all the blood drove from my heart
at the thought for we were caught
on the airy stairway without chance
to advance or retreat and every
minute that i stood there in inde-
cision the tramping feet of the
guards were nearing me why they
were descending by the stair instead
of the ropes i could not guess
though it may have been that they
had already started down the stair
before the alarm from below but
whatever the reason they were com-
ing nearer and nearer until finally
they were directly across the shaft
coming around the down-slanting
curve of the stairway toward us
the time-raider



  my brain momentarily stupefied
by the oncoming deadly peril again
acted and with frantic speed i un-
rolled the rope that was wound round
my body the low wall that protect-
ed the stairs right side was pierced
at regular intervals with circular
ornamental openings and swiftly i
passed the rope through one of these
and tied it securely then tied its
other end into a double loop at
onee lantin saw my purpose and
with a muttered good he set his
foot in one of the loops while i did
the same with the other

  swiftly the tramping feet were
coming around the curve toward us
though in the murky darkness of the
shaft we could make out nothing
feet in the loops at the ropes end
we grasped the low wall of the stair
and gently swung ourselves over it
then hanging above the abyss we
lowered ourselves until we swung
some twenty feet below the stair
floating gently back and forth at the
ropes end with nearly two miles of
space below us

  the marching guards came quickly
around the stairs curve and i held
my breath as they passed the place
where our rope was tied if one but
felt it and slashed carelessly with a
knife we would hurtle down to death
on the floor of the pit far below
but the guards passed on and i
could plainly hear the command of
their leader to move faster as they
went by us

  waiting until they had progressed
to the opposite side of the shaft
lantin and i began to pull our-
selves up slowly toilsomely we
fought our way upward until our
hands gripped the stairs rail and we
were able to scramble over it onto the
steps

  as i rolled over the wall onto
those steps the hilt of my rapier
struck the metal stairway with a loud
jar appalled i lay tense for min-
utes but there was no sound to indi-

cate the guards had heard and we
could hear their marching footsteps
dying away below

  i rose to my feet then breathing
hard a near shave that i told
lantin who was also struggling to
regain his breath if those guards
had caught us on the stair it would
have been all up with us untying
the rope from the wall i again wound
it round my body and stepped up
to where lantin awaited me

  he was looking back the way we
had come peering into the darkness
as i stepped up toward him he cried
suddenly look out wheeler and
as i instinctively threw myself flat
on the stairway a heavy knife hur-
tled out of the air behind me and
passed over me striking the wall i
jumped to my feet and turned rip-
ping out my sword

  five steps down the stair from us
a guard was standing a tall dark-
faced fellow whom i could just see
in the nightmare blackness of the
shaft in a flash i knew that the
clang of my rapier on the stairway
had been heard by this fellow at
least and that he had come back to
investigate and had found us

  the man below me uttered a hoarse
cry and ran straight up toward me
his long spear aimed at my heart
but by now my own rapier was out
and avoiding the spear by a quick
sidestep i thrust with my blade at
his throat where no armor protected
him the stab was a true one and
he sank to the stair with a chok-
ing terrible cry that rang out eerily
there in the vast dark shaft from
far below his cry was answered
there was no time to lose and we
pressed on up the stair

  but now there were cries from be-
low and a bugle peal came up toward
us it was evident that the alarm
had been sounded by the cry of the
guard i had killed and that we were
being pursued


weird tales

  i knew that we were very near to
the stairs top by then but although
we knew the metal cover of the shaft
was not in place there was no light
from the great opening above us the
great temple being as dark as the
shaft below it

  pray god there are no guards at
the top of the stair i cried to lan-
tin as we sped upward he did not
answer and from his agonized breath-
ing i knew that he was out of wind
from our long torturing climb and
away across the shaft now there was
a chorus of shouts as the guards be-
neath raced after us their cries
halted for a moment and by this i
knew that they had found the body
of the man i had killed then with
yelps of rage they sped on after us

s staggered drunkonly up the
last curve of the stair out of
the darkness appeared the little col-
lapsible stairway which joined the
temples black ring of flooring with
the great spiral on which we stood
there was no sign of the presence of
any guards around or above it so i
jerked out the sword at my belt and
clasping it in one hand strode cau-
tiously up the little stair until i stood
on the black flooring that was the
rim of the shaft up which we had
come

  dense darkness reigned in the gi-
gantic building and the complete
silence in it showed me that it was de-
serted lantin was beside me now
and the cries of the pursuing guards
were ringing up the shaft ever louder
as they neared us i sprang to the
buildings wall clawing frantically
along its side

 abruptly my hands encountered
the thick lever i was searching for
and as i jerked it down as far as it
would go i sobbed with relief there
was a loud click and the little col-
lapsible stair swung up and folded
ihto an aperture in the wall

  that will hold them on the stair

for a time i told my friend who
had come up to me and was grasp-
ing my arm as we raced around the
wall to the buildings entrance and
exit i explained in a few words what
i had done it was well for us too
that i had remembered how the little
stair was folded and unfolded for
as we sped down the tunneled gate-
way to the outside air there came a
shout of baffled rage from behind us
as the guards on the stair found their
progress thus stopped

  speeding down the arched tunnel
through the temples great wall we
emerged at last into the open air
for a moment heedless of the clamor
in the temple behind us we stood
with swelling hearts breathing in the
free air expanding almost there
beneath the limitless sky after our
sojourn in the cramped cavern below

  darkness reigned over the city of
the kanlars a darkness intensified by
the absence of moon or stars above
from where we stood the broad
street plashed with ruddy light from
the glowing bulbs along its length
stretched away to the east piercing
the mass of winking lights that be-
tokened the citys presence even
from where we stood we could see
that there were many of the guards
in the street and there was no chance
of our passing them unchallenged

  i turned to lantin but before i
could speak we both shrank back into
the temples entrance footsteps were
sounding on the ground near us com-
ing toward us along the outside of the
temples wall

  we crouched against the wall of
the tunneled entrance hearing the
footsteps come nearer from the
temple behind us came the faint rag-
ing clamor of the guards on the stair
who were still blocked by my strata-
gem then two figures appeared in
the entrance of the tunnel two
ghostly white figures who were ad-
vancing through the darkness
the time-raideb



  slaves muttered lantin and
from the white robes and stiff move-
ments i saw that he had guessed the
identity of the two aright they
walked on toward us then passed us
at arms length walking stiffly me-
chanically past us whether or not
they saw us i can not say though if
they had glimpsed us i doubt wheth-
er their soulless natures would have
understood the significance of our
presence there at any rate they
passed us by and proceeded on down
the tunnel

 my sword was in my hand and
grasping it by the blade six inches
or more beneath the hilt i stole
quickly down the tunnel after the
white-robed figures as quietly as
possible i hastened after them and
in a moment the heavy hilt of
my rapier swung down on their skulls
in two swift blows and they slumped
to the floor a low call brought lan-
tin to my side and we hastily pulled
the long white robes from the two on
the floor and put them on over our
own clothing i shuddered with deep
loathing in the process for these two
men on the floor were icy-cold to the
touch dead-alive and slaves to the
kanlars i hoped at least that my
blows had released them from their
dreadful servitude

  disguised now by the white gar-
ments we hastened again out of the
tunnel and down the broad ramp in-
to the red-lit street we passed some
distance along that street before we
came near to any of the guards and
when we did so we changed our pace
walking stiffly and rigidly eyes star-
ing straight ahead striving to give
to our faces the blank deathly ex-
pression of the faces of the slaves

  we were unchallenged the guards
passing us without giving us more
than a casual glance and as we
passed group after group of the ar-
mored men we began to breathe
easier though we still kept to our un-
lifelike walk and expression

as we drew iarther toward the
citys edge the street became
more deserted the buildings began
to lessen in size and frequency and
we were not far from the spot where
the red lights along the street ended
and it became a road

  abruptly i clutched lantins arm
from far behind us from the temple
whence we had fled there rose a great
ringing sound a vast bell-notc that
echoed out over all the city clearly
it was repeated and now from far
behind us also came a dim angry
clamor a score or more of raging
shouts through which there cut the
clear note of a bugle

 the guards i whispered to
lantin tensely someone has found
them there on the stair theyre
after us

  faster he muttered to me with-
out turning were almost out of
the city

  it was so in truth for wo were
nearing the end of the streets lighted
part while on each side the buildings
were becoming fewer we had met no
one on the street for the last few min-
utes and as we passed under the last
of the glowing bulbs i turned and
cried to my friend out of the city
lantin  

  he caught his breath turned to rue
his face livid and whispered for
gods sake wheeler be still that
guard over there is watching us
my heart contracted suddenly as
i looked toward the left of the street
and saw the man he referred to a
guard in full armor who stood at the
doorway of a small building and re-
garded us suspiciously no doubt
his attention had been aroused by the
spectacle of one slave talking to an-
other and i cursed my folly in crying
out to lantin

  we passed on hearts thumping
into the darkness that lay beyond the
lane of crimson light once safe
within it we swiftly shed the white
robes whose length hampered our


weird tales

movements and then set out along
the road at a rapid trot

  away back in the city the dis-
turbed angry clamor of our pursuers
lessened faded we were in open
country now and as the road soon
ended we fled on over the long
grassy swells toward the east toward
the hills and the valley where our
time-car was hidden

  safe i exulted as we stumbled
on through the thick darkness
theyll never even know what direc-
tion we took

  they will if the guard who saw
us talking tells them what he saw
replied lantin and i sobered

 even then- i began but

broke off suddenly and looked baek
lantin i shouted lantin
out of the city toward us were
streaming a hundred or more men
carrying with them on long poles
many of the flashing red light-giving
bulbs whose crimson rays struck
down and glinted on the armor and
spear-points of the men who carried
them over a mile behind yet the
gap between us was fast decreasing
as they came straight on toward us

   the grass  i gasped as we
stumbled on they can track us
easily by it 

  the grass over which we ran was
high and seemingly very dry and
brittle so that at every step we
crushed down great masses of it into
a trail that a child could have fol-
lowed and a great wolflike shout-
ing came from behind as our pursu-
ers struck our track

 on we ran lungs laboring and
hearts near to bursting but steadily
the guards behind us drew nearer
until they were within a half-mile of
us by that time we knew that we
must be drawing near to the valley
where our car was concealed and
then it was that our real race began

  i heard lantins breath coming in
great sobs and knew that he was
almost winded the long climb up

the stair from the pit and the flight
through the city had sapped his
strength and his endurance was near
its breaking point

  through the darkness a darker
mass loomed up and as we sped to-
ward it it showed itself to us as the
little wood that lay across the val-
leys mouth more by blind ehance
than by design i think we had come
straight toward our objective and
now we struggled through the thicket
with frantic bursts of speed

 we emerged from the wood into
the open valley and as we did so
lantin sank to the ground

 go on wheeler he gasped
you can get to the car and get
away i cant go farther

  i looked back and saw that our
pursuers were advancing in a broad
line through the wood carrying for-
ward a chain of the ruddy lights so
that we might not hide from them in
the shadows there was no grass be-
neath the trees and they could not
track us in that way but came on
swiftly for all that shouting to each
other mirthfully

  i cant leave you here i told
lantin if you stay i stay

 go on he ordered you can
make it without me hurry

  i glanced back hesitated a moment
then swiftly stooped and swung an
arm under lantins shoulders half
lifting him to his feet then half
dragging half carrying him i toiled
up the valley toward our hidden car

  i did not look back but long rays
of red light stabbed past me as our
pursuers and their lights emerged
from the wood by that crimson
glare they saw me for a savage cry
went up a few strides and i was at
the spot on the valleys bottom on the
slope above which lay the time-car
with fast-waning strength i started
up that slope

 down the valley toward me
bounded a score of men spears and
swords gleaming in the light of the
the time-raider



bulb-torches behind them dragging
lantin on blind with sweat and every
muscle straining to its utmost power
i toiled up the slope more like a
goaded maddened beast than a hu-
man being while lantin still be-
sought me to drop him and save my-
self

 and up the slope after me raced
the shouting guards a hundred yards
behind and gaining every second i
burst through the screen of boughs
around our car and sobbed with re-
lief to see that it was still there un-
touched i spun open the circular
door in its top and dropped lantin
inside i had just placed my feet
inside the opening when a dozen of
the armored guards burst through
the screen of branches their red bulb-
torches illuminating the little clear-
ing with crimson light

  they stopped short on seeing me
some fifteen feet away the three
nearest me raised their right arms
above their heads a heavy spear
poised in each then like leaping
metal serpents the three heavy dag-
ger-pointed weapons flashed through
the air toward me

  but in that split second there came
the click of a switch from the interior
of the car a gust of sudden wind
smote me and then the guards
torches and even the three spears in
midair had vanished and the car
lantin and i were speeding on into
time

chapter 

over the ice 

xre had flashed through two days

  	 and nights before lantin judged
it safe to stop our progress in time
by then we had started the space-
movement mechanism and had sent
the car up to a height of a mile above
the ground once there we snapped
off the time-wave and hung in mid-
air motionless in both time and space

  it was eariy morning now bright
and sunny and peering down over
the cars side to the valley below i
could see no sign of life in the two
days through which we had passed so
quickly it was evident that the
guards had given up searching for
us and had returned to the city i
wondered how they explained to
themselves our sudden disappearance

  i slid down into the cars interior
now and closed the circular door
above me sinking down on the pad-
ded floor with utter weariness i tried
to express to lantin my thanks for
saving my life since had he acted a
fraction of a second later i should
have been struck down by the flash-
ing spears of our pursuers but lan-
tin would not hear me declaring that
alone he would have been unable ever
to reach the car and so conscious
that without the other each of us
would have perished we let the mat-
ter rest

  in a few minutes lantin returned to
the controls and swinging the car in
a great circle pointed it south open-
ing up the power gradually until we
were racing down toward the south-
ern horizon with our highest speed
soon far ahead the glistening icc
came into view and in a few minutes
after that the green land behind us
had dwindled to a speck against the
ice and then vanished high above
the ground we sped across the end-
less ice splitting the air like a me-
teor

  hour after hour we fled on across
the gleaming fields of whiteness the
cold air had forced us to turn on the
heater of the car and even with it we
were none too warm below from
horizon to horizon billowed the fro-
zen fields with here and there a white
dune or hill to break the monotony of
the landscape

  finally in midafternoon a thick-
ening line of black showed against the
southern horizon we reduced our
speed and sinking closer to the


weird tales

ground sped down toward the black
line

  it seemed to grow as we came
nearer loomed larger and larger un-
til at last we hung above the black
mass gazing down at it in silent awe
and it was a wall

  but what a wall a gigantic
mountain-high and mountain-thick
barrier of solid black metal extend-
ing as far as we could see from the
eastern to the western horizon a co-
lossal barrier of metal all of a mile
and a half in height with a thickness
at the bottom of nearly a mile and at
the top of half that much a smooth-
sided dully gleaming mass beside
which the walls of mighty babylon
would have been toylike microscopic

  and with that wall the ice stopped
on the northern side of the barrier
the fields of ice stretched away as far
as the eye could reach but on its
southern side there was no ice grass
of dull green and small trees gnarled
and twisted by the glaciers cold lay
to the walls south a vista of rolling
bleak plains that extended down to
the southern horizon

  hanging above the mighty flat-
topped barrier we surveyed it stupe-
fieii all around us was no sign of
life no sound no movement only
the white expanse to the north the
green one to the south and between
them separating and defining them
the titani wall

  lantin spoke excitedly you see
its purpose wheeler it has been
built here as a dam to hold back the
glacier to stem the tides of ice but
how built to think that men can
do things like that

  i saw now that lantin spoke aright
and that it was to dam the engulfing
southward-flowing ice that the wall
had been built and i was struck
with awe at the achievement what
were the great chinese wall and mar-
tian canals to this here in the far
future fifteen thousand years ahead
of our own time we were seeing an-

other step in the conquest of nature
by man he had leveled mountains
and turned rivers and here below
us had thrust forth a hand and
halted the resistless glaciers

  an hour we hung above the co-
lossal barrier fascinated and then re-
membered our mission and sped again
south

as we rocketed on we could see no
sign of life below nothing but
the bleak arctic plains with here and
there some sparse vegetation

  again lantin cried out and when
i looked south i discerned an odd
flicker of light a seeming hesitating
wavering of the air we sped down
toward it dropping down again to a
scant mile above the ground

  far ahead showed expanses ot
bright green and as we drew nearer
i saw that there were small patches
of white against the green oddly reg-
ular in shape as we sped on these
white blotches changed to buildings
and the green to verdant lawns and
gardens in which they were set
again lantin stopped the car while
we looked down puzzled for in a
straight line from east to west was
the boundary the limit of the gar-
dens and the buildings north of
that line were the cold wind-swept
plains and stunted arctic vegetation
while south of the same invisible line
seemingly only a few feet from the
bleak tundras began the luxuriant
tropical gardens stretching away
south as far as the eye could see
and also the elusive flicker of light
seemed to begin at the same point
and to be present everywhere south
of it if you have ever seen the flicker
of heated air above railway tracks or
hot sand on a warm afternoon you
will understand me it was like that
an elusive fleeting wavering in the
air below us

  i cant understand it said lan-
tin pointing down to the invisible
line which separated aretic world
the time-raider



from tropic gardens like those
only a few feet away from the cold
plain  

  its beyond me i told him
another thing lantin the car is as
cold as ever even with the heater
functioning yet down there the
country looks tropical

  he shook his head and starting
the car we sped on south as cold as
we had been above the glacier while
below was a landscape that reminded
me of florida in my own time set
in the lawns and gardens the white
buildings became more numerous as
we sped on we could see that they
were of varying shapes some cone-
shaped others cubical while still
others were spherical like great
globes of white stone sunk a little in
the earth the cone-shaped buildings
were the most numerous i saw
though there were many of the other
designs but nowhere was there a
building that was cylindrical

  ever and again our eyes caught that
inexplicable flieker in the air below
us we were flying with reduced
speed now less than a mile above the
ground and beneath us the lawns and
gardens had disappeared giving way
to the crowded buildings of a great
city in the broad streets of that
city were tiny moving figures and
many vehicles seemed to flash contin-
ually along the wide avenues but
there was no sign of aircraft

  always the buildings grew larger
and it was plain that we were ap-
proaching the citys eenter away
ahead of us a great cone began to
loom up gigantically an immense
cone-shaped building that was fully
as large as the temple of the raider
back in the city of the kanlars we
changed our course headed down to-
ward the colossal center building as
we drew nearer we saw that it was
smooth and unbroken of side and at
its top it was truncated flattened
the summit of the cone forming a flat
circular platform a few hundred feet

in diameter we glimpsed this much
and then lantin sent the car down
on a long slant toward the cones flat
summit

  well land there he said this
city is kom without doubt

  i nodded but did not answer for
my attention was engaged by some-
thing else as we slanted smoothly
down toward the cone with moderate
speed i noticed that the strange
flicker of light that had puzzled us
seemed to be growing plainer
stronger nearer it apparently hung
steady above the cone a few rods
over its summit and as we rushed
down toward that summit the truth
struck me and the nature of the odd
flickering was clear to me in a sudden
flash of intuition

  lantin i screamed that
flicker its a roof a transparent
roof stop the car

  his face livid he reached toward
the space-mechanism control but be-
fore ever his hand touched it there
was an ear-splitting crash i was
thrown violently forward in the car
and as my head hit its steel wall with
stunning force something seemed to
explode in my brain and conscious-
ness left me

chapter 

before the council of kom

through a throbbing pain-racked
--darkness light came down to me
stronger and stronger there was a
dull monotonous sound that seemed
to float down to me from great
heights i turned struggled opened
my eyes

  i was lying on a soft mat set on a
low narrow platform of metal
above me was a high white ceiling
and as i half-raised myself on one
arm i was able to survey the rest of
the room in which i lay

  it was a bright airy room white-
walled and sunny at one end of it
were high open windows without


weird tales

glass or shutter and through them
streamed the sunlight and the soft
air except for the bed on which i
lay and two metal chairs of simple
design the room was quite bare but
it was an austere clean bareness that
was pleasing to the eye

 now memory rushed back to me
and sudden fear came with it where
was lantin had he survived the
crash i began to struggle up from
my reclining position but sank back
for a moment as a door in one of the
walls slid aside and a man entered
the room

  tall and commanding of appear-
ance with dark hair and clear youth-
ful face yet something about the
eyes stamped him as a man of middle
age almost elderly he was dressed
in a short white tunic bordered with
three narrow stripes of purple when
he perceived that i was awake and
regarding him he paused for a mo-
ment in surprize then came on to-
ward me

  a friendly smile illumined his face
as he spoke to me in the kanlar
tongue

  you are awake wheelaire and
your friend too has just awakened
lantin i exclaimed he is all
right he was not hurt

 the other smiled no more
than yourself would you like to
see him

  i assented eagerly and made to
rise but he pushed me back it is
not needful he said and reaching
down to the foot of the metal plat-
form on which i lay he touched a
concealed button at once the plat-
form rose gently from its supports
until it swung in the air four feet
above the floor when my new-found
friend laid his hand on its edge it
moved gently through the air under
the impetus of a slight push

  he saw my astonishment and ex-
plained the metal is clorium the
same material we once tised for our
air-boats it is weightless under

the influence of certain forces
then as an afterthought he added
my name is kethra

  pushing my platform easily through
the air before him he was moving to-
ward the door of the room when i
stopped him with a gesture can
i look from the window there a mo-
ment i asked indicating the high
openings by way of answer he
stepped over to the window in ques-
tion his hand on my platforms edge
bringing me there also i raised my-
self gazed eagerly out

  i saw at once that i must be near
the top of the great cone-shaped
building we had been making for
when we crashed below and all
around the white buildings extended
to the horizons looking like thou-
sands of huge geometry-models cast
down indiscriminately cones and
spheres and cubes high above them
as i was yet i could discern swift
movement in the streets crowds of
pedestrians surging to and fro flash-
ing vehicles of strange design that
followed the broad thoroughfares
rising in the air here and there to
pass over each other glancing away
down the long slanting side of the
cone near whose summit i stood i
saw at its base other great crowds
who massed and swirled aimlessly
around the building i turned to
kethra

  and this is kom i said

  he nodded it is kom

  i pointed toward the teeming crowds
that eddied around the buildings
base you must count your people
here by the millions i queried

  his face grew somber as he too
looked down at the masses of human-
ity below it is seldom there are
crowds like that he said but this
is a time of great events and our peo-
ple gather around this building
which is the seat of the council of
kom that they may learn what de-
cisions have been made
the time -raider

  he turned from the window face
solemn and unsmiling now and with
a slight push sent my platform drift-
ing toward and through the door
conducting me down a long corridor
he turned in at another room similar
in every detail to the one i had just
left and there standing up and
gazing down through an open window
as i had just done was lantin

  he turned and saw me came to-
ward me anxiously at a touch from
kethra my platform sank down to
the floor and assisted by my friend
i rose weakly to my feet

  youre all right wheeler he
asked quickly i assured him that i
was for the weakness and dizziness
i had felt were rapidly leaving me
lantin laughed ruefully what a
fools trick of mine to smash straight
down into that roof he pointed
upward towrard the blue sky and
walking over to the window beside
him i looked up curiously

  there was the same flicker in the
sky that i had noticed from above
an elusive wavering flash of light
that i knew now was caused by the
sunlight glinting off the flat trans-
parent roof

  the roof i said to ivethra
does it cover all the city

  all of kom lies beneath it he
said without it could we live
like this   he swept an arm around
in a wide gesture that included the
soft warm air the open windows and
the white city below laced with the
greenery of gardens

  but how is it built i asked
how supported is it glass or
what material

  its no material at all he re-
plied astoundingly its force

  i looked at him a little incredu-
lously force it was solid enough
when we crashed into it

  yes it is force he smiled
thats the reason it is almost in-
visible from above or below it is
a perpetual sheet of electric force

drawn over the city from end to end
it is so designed and projected from
a ring of stations around the eity
that it excludes some vibrations ef
tho ether and allows others to enter
for instance it excludes the vibra-
tions called matter such as air or
such as your car all of the citys
air is pumped in through special
vents in the force-shield on the
other hand it allows the vibrations
of light and of radiant heat to enter
and so our city is lighted and heated
by the sun itself without such a
shield we would be living in a eity
as bleak and cold as the plains that
surround it

  so we crashed into an invisible
field of force i said and shook my
head well it seemed solid enough
when we hit it  

  the most powerful force in the
world could not crash through it
said kethra and it is fortunate
that you were not going at high speed
or you would have been annihilated
as it was we found you both lying
unconscious in your car up on the
force-shield and as we can neutral-
ize it at will at given spots we were
able to bring you down to the city

  but the car i cried it is not
destroyed is it it was not com-
pletely smashed

  he shook his head it was hard-
ly damaged at all he assured us
the point or prow was bent back
but that has already been repaired
he paused a moment then said an
astounding thing the car does you
credit in its design it is too bad
that after making it and coming so
far into the future you have been
unable to find your friend

  i gasped and looked at lantin his
face reflected utmost surprize and
he said i didnt tell him wheeler
ill swear i didnt

  kethra smiled neither of you
told me he said but you have
lain unconscious for a day and in


weird tales

that time we learned all your story
my friends and learned how you
came here to warn us of the peril
beyond the ice that peril of an evil
being whom you call the raider

  but how i asked helplessly

  in answer he touched a button
set in the wall and motioned us to
seat ourselves in the chairs beside the
window a green-robed servant en-
tered in a moment with a metal
cabinet he handed this to kethra
and then departed

the cabinet was an oblong box of
black metal a yard or more in
its greatest length our companion
touched a stud in the floor with his
sandaled foot and a small square
section of the floor sprang up on four
legs or supports forming a little
table setting the cabinet on this
table our friend opened it

  inside was a small gleaming ap-
paratus consisting of a squat little
box on which was set a small horn
like that of a radio loud-speaker but
much smaller from the box a flex-
ible cord led splitting at its end
into three separate cords each of
which was metal-tipped setting
this on the table kethra then drew
from the cabinet three or four small
shapeless objects gray and withered
and deeply wrinkled smaller in size
than a baseball the nature of which
i could not guess

  he turned to us now this
mechanism he said indicating the
gleaming apparatus is what wo
call a brain-reader as you know
the brain preserves in its convolu-
tions an indelible unchangeable rec-
ord of every word and action when
we remember a thing we simply
refer to that record which we call
memory but which is in reality a
very tiny change but a lasting one
and this apparatus when connected
to a human brain by way of the
nervous system reads from the

myriad convolutions of that brain
the record of memory which is
stamped on those convolutions

  with a swift movement he fas-
tened three clamps of metal to his
body one above the forehead one
around the neck and the other along
his spine these clamps make di-
rect contact to the nervous system
through the skin he explained
and to them i attach the three
cords from the brain-reader  suit-
ing the action to the word this
done he snapped a switch in the
little box beneath the horn and at
once a nasal metallic voice began
to speak from that horn in the kan-
lar tongue

  kethras own voice came to us
above the twanging one from the
brain-reader it is giving a record
of my experiences within the last
few hours he explained and will
go back farther and farther as it
continues back to my very first mem-
ory if allowed to run or i can use
it to concentrate on any given period
of my own life and it will read with
unvarying accuracy the impressions
and sensations of my brain during
that period a mechanical perfect
memory and he snapped off the
switch and removed the clamps from
his body

  nor does its usefulness stop
there he added while we stared
dumfoundedly at the little mechan-
ism here he went on picking
up one of the withered gray objects
is a human brain the brain of one
of the great men of our people who
died five centuries ago and yet
every memory and every thought and
sensation in his life imprinted un-
changeably on his brain is available
to us by using the brain-reader  

  he rapidly fitted over the withered
brain a hollow hemisphere of metal
and attached to it the cords from
the apparatus a snap of the switch
and again the same nasal voice broke
the time-raider



the silence from the horn speaking
in the kanlar tongue and reading
steadily on from the brain it was
connected with reciting the inmost
thoughts and ideas and aspirations of
a man dead for five hundred years i
shuddered involuntarily and kethra
snapped off the apparatus

  it seems strange to you he
said but you will see the wisdom
of such an apparatus when a great
man dies a man of mental ability
above the rest of us his brain is re-
moved especially prepared and then
filed and indexed in a building re-
served for that purpose there are
thousands of brains preserved there
and every one of them is available
at all times by means of the brain-
reader to aid us with its knowledge
its experience its memories thus
when a man dies among us his intel-
ligence does not die but remains as
a record for us to consult at will a
record of that mans ideas and
achievements

  and while we were unconscious
i broke in you used the brain-
reader on us learned our story
learned why we came here

 it is so he said and his face
darkened we sought to know who
you might be the first strangers ever
to approach us and from the brain-
reader came your amazing tale and
we know all that you came to tell us
concerning that creature of evil you
term the raider and it is that
knowledge that has brought those
crowds below to await the decision
of the council

  but the raider i cried
what is it kethra do you
know

  i know he said simply and a
brooding expression dropped on his
face i know he repeated and
all here in kom know and that
you too may know who have had
dealings with this same raider i will
relate to you what we do know soon

the council meets and you will be
questioned further but now-

  he was silent a moment then spoke
in a voice vibrant and low-toned

the history of the kanlars he
began the people of the
cylinders the evil ones whose doom
draws near know men of the
past that ages ago though not so
far back as your own time our
people dwelt in four mighty cities
each of which was nearly as large
as kom itself there was no ice-
flood from the north then and the
country around those cities was green
and fair yet none lived in that
country all preferring the gayer life
of the vast towns long ago the
people had learned to make their
food from the soil direct as we do
today and so there was no need of
tilling the land or living on it and
so into the four great cities had
drifted all the people in this land

  in each city the buildings were
constructed of a different design
here in kom all of the buildings
were cone-shaped and thus this
became known as kom the city of
cones and we the dwellers in it as
the people of the cones another
city was the city of cubes another
the city of spheres and still another
the city of cylinders

  each of these four cities was
free and independent each ruled by
a council selected by its inhabitants
and being thus independent there
arose rivalry between the cities and
fierce jealousy each strove to outdo
the others in their scientific achieve-
ments and each strove to keep its
blood from intermixing with the
others thus in the city of cylinders
the kanlars or people of the cylin-
ders gradually evolved into a bright-
haired race while in kom the
khluns or people of the cones were
a dark-haired race and the other
two cities differed likewise from each
other and the rest


weird tales

  ages passed and then down from
the north rolled a mighty tide of ice
sweeping over the whole land and
submerging all under its frozen flood
it rolled down toward the four
cities and finally had forged south
until it was at the gates of the city
of cubes in desperation the people
of the cubes appealed to those in
kom for shelter and it was granted
them they came down to kom
every one and the ice rolled over
and hid the city of cubes next it
engulfed the city of spheres and
its people likewise found refuge in
kom which was the most southern
of all the four cities and finally
the ice-tide swept over the city of
cylinders and its people the kan-
lars were forced to seek refuge in
kom also though they liked it not

  but the ice did not stop it came
on ever south until it threatened
to cover kom also and leave our
people homeless and shelterless so
taking counsel among themselves the
people of kom set out to stop the
progress of the glacial sheet

  they kindled great uprisings far
beneath the earths surface until
the tortured earth heaved tip in a
great wall across the ice-floods path
and then that this wall of earth
might not be swept away the scien-
tists of kom showed them a way by
which every kind of material could
be transmuted at will into other
elements by a recasting of its elec-
tronic structure and using this
power the people of kom smoothed
the gigantic barrier they had created
and then using the instruments their
scientists had devised for them they
turned on the great wall a ray that
changed it to metal by its power of
element-transmutation it was fin-
ished and when the ice rolled down
to this smooth mountain-range of
metal it was checked halted far
away on either side it rolled on and
engulfed the country but the wall so

dammed it that it could not progress
farther toward the city

  yet the cold of the glacier was
not halted by the wall and to com-
bat that cold the great shield of
force was devised that stretches over
all kom and into which you crashed
in your ear it admitted the suns
light and heat but excluded the cold
winds from the glacier and thus
having thwarted nature itself the
troubles of the people of kom were
seemingly at an end

  the people of the other three
cities settled down contentedly
enough in kom and each people
built their own type of dwelling
cube or sphere or cylinder and all
mixed intermarried and mingled in
race with the exception of the kan-
lars the people of the cylinders
these still held apart though unob-
trusively

  and as the years went by the sci-
entists of kom came to more and
more wisdom they found ways to
strengthen their own bodies so that
they lived for great stretches of time
as we do yet they sent their explor-
ers out to other planets they cast
their vision out to the farthest stars
they learned to create life and they
learned to conquer death almost
the flight of the soul from the body
they could not control for there is a
wisdom above mans but the body
itself they could retain as moving
and lifelike as in life itself though
soulless

  it seemed indeed that no other
steps of wisdom remained up which
to climb and then without the
knowledge of the other people the
kanlar scientists set themselves to
conquer the secret of time unable
to find a way of controlling time
themselves of moving in it at will
they created a monstrous undreamed-
of thing a thing of shapeless in-
choate body which was yet living
and which eould transform itself at
will into mists and vapors and in
the time-raider



that gaseous form could travel at
will through time and this thing
the kanlars made setting in it three
orbs of light that were- its organs of
sense and its seat of intelligence and
this thing is the same that you now
call the raider

  this indeed happened in my
own lifetime a scant score of years
ago and when the kanlars brought
their ereation before the supreme
council of kora i was a member of
that eouneil

    they explained the power of
their creation they showed its life
its intelligence and they proposed
to the council a plan which posses-
sion of the raider made possible

  they pointed out that since the
raider could travel at will through
time it could whirl back into th
past or into the future and seize
people from every age bringing them
back to our own time to be our slaves
always there had been none but free
people in our cities nor were slaves
needed since nearly all of our work
was done by machinery yet such was
the evil plan of the kanlars

  the council rejected the plan in
horror and it also warned the kan-
lars that unless they destroyed the
thing- they had made the council
would hunt it out and destroy it it-
self the kanlars left in rage and
took with them the raider but later
they promised to destroy it within a
certain period of time saying that
they desired to study it further be-
fore doing so

  so for a time they kept the
raider and it grew swiftly in power
and intelligence until it became a
deity to the kanlars a being whose
every word to them was law again
the council warned them to destroy
their creation and again they agreed
to do so but in secret on a night
soon after every one of the kanlars
assembled on their air-boats and fled
from the city taking with them the
raider

   we could not know where they
had gone but sent out many scouts
to search for them and when all
our scouts had returned without
finding trace of them we decided
that they had fled with their- evil
god to another planet and so the
matter rested we had always
thought that the ice-fields in the
north extended clear to the pole and
could not know of the land there
where the kanlars had gone

  but now with the knowledge the
brain-reader gleaned from you while
you were unconscious all the people
in kom know the peril that hangs
over them know that the raider and
the kanlars have gathered thousands
of fierce warriors from all ages and
that they plan to sweep down and
loot our city and kill its people so
the council meets now to decide
what course of action we will take
kethra finished and i silently
pondered his amazing story but
lantin broke in with a query two
things puzzle me he said how is
it that you speak the same tongue as
the kanlars and why are there no
cylindrical buildings in the city be-
low you spoke of each people
building its own design of dwellings
here but there are no cylinders
when the kanlars fled kethra
explained the cjdinders were de-
molished for none of the other peo-
ples would then live in them as to
our language it was always the same
for all the four cities you call it the
kanlar tongue because you heard it
first frofh them but it is equally the
language of the people of kom

before we could ask more ques-
tions a single bell-note- sounded
from a corner of the room the
council murmured kethra you
are summoned before it  

  he motioned us out of- the room
and led us down the corridor outside
toward a small elevator that was
curiously familiar in appearance


weird tales

there in that building of the future
a lever was touched and we flashed
silently down a long shaft past level
after level of the great cones inte-
rior the car stopped and we stepped
out of it into a small antechamber
following kethra across it we strode
through a high arched entrance into
a great amphitheater a semicircular
room with bank on bank of rising
tiers of seats in each seat was a man
attired like kethra and the gaze of
all was instantly focused on us as we
entered on a dais at the semi-
circles center sat four men older
than the others and there was
another chair beside the four which
was empty a servant swiftly placed
two collapsible seats on the dais on
which lantin and i seated ourselves
then kethra strode to the front of
the dais and began to address the
assemblage

  he spoke in an even unraised
voice but from the expressions on
the faces of the council members it
was easy to see that his words were
of intense interest to them he re-
viewed the history of kom which he
had already briefly recounted to us
and then pointed out the peril that
threatened the city he concluded
with a strong plea that the peo-
ple of kom should take the of-
fensive and strike at the kanlars and
the raider in their own city rather
than let the battle come to kom

  when he had finished there were
many questions as to the means to
be employed for the battle it seemed
that air-boats had not been used
greatly of late in kom because of
the difficulty of flying beneath the
great roof of force and thus it would
be hard to transport a force over the
icefields in any short space of time

  but kethra waved aside these ob-
jections a great fleet of air-boats
eould be made in a few days he de-

clared if the people of kom turned
their energies toward it as to
weapons the scientists of kom could
design these and they would also be
made in great numbers as effective
as possible

  a solidly built white-haired matt
in a lower row stood up and ex-
claimed but what of the raider
i give our own equivalent of the
unpronounceable term used by the
people of kom for that being re-
member he is powerful how power-
ful we can not even guess and if
hard-pressed he can flee into time
and bide his time to strike at u
again with or without the kanlars

   not so  replied kethra   when
we build our air-boats we will equip
each with the time-traveling appara-
tus invented by these two men which
is installed in their own car thus
equipped our air-boats will be able
to pursue the raider into time and
destroy him should he flee there

  there were other objections other
questions but kethra overrode them
all it was plain that he was intent
on following his plan of striking at
the kanlars unexpectedly instead of
awaiting their attack and he finally
won the council over to his side we
were called on twice to furnish infor-
mation on pertinent points and fin-
ally after hours of debate the coun-
cil voted by a large majority to build
with all speed a great fleet of air-
boats equipped for time-traveling
like our own car as soon as com-
pleted and provided with weapons
by the scientists the entire force was
to speed north under the leadership
of kethra drop unexpectedly upon
the city of the cylinders and crush
the kanlars and the raider forever

   the pursuit of the raider through the future
of the world while the sun grows cold and the
earth withers is thrillingly described in the
startling chapters that bring this story to a con-
clusion in next months issue

  draculas guest

by bram stoker

when we started for our
drive the sun was shining
brightly on munich and the
air was full of the joyousness of early
summer just as we were about to
depart herr delbriick the maitre
dhotel of the quatre saisons where
i was staying came down bareheaded
to the carriage and after wishing me
a pleasant drive said to the coach-
man still holding his hand on the
handle of the carriage door
remember you are back by
nightfall the sky looks bright but
there is a shiver in the north wind
that says there may be a sudden
storm but i am sure you will not be
late here he smiled and added
for you know what night it is
johann answered with an emphatic
ja mein herrand touching his
hat drove off quickly

  when we had cleared the town i
said after signaling to him to stop
tell me johann what is tonight
he crossed himself as he answered
laconically walpurgis nacm
then he took out his watch a great
old-fashioned german silver thing as
big as a turnip and looked at it with
his eyebrows gathered together and
a litle impatient shrug of his shoul-
ders i realized that this was his
way of respectfully protesting against
the unnecessary delay and sank back
in the carriage merely motioning him
to proceed

  he started off rapidly as if to make

   this story was intended as an episode in bram
stokers novel dracula but was excised because
of the length of the book

up for lost time every now and then
the horses seemed to throw up their
heads and sniffed the air suspiciously
on such occasions i often looked
around in alarm the road was
pretty bleak for we were traversing
a sort of high wind-swept plateau
as we drove i saw a road that looked
but little used and which seemed to
dip through a little winding valley
it looked so inviting that even at the
risk of offending him i called johann
to stop-and when he had pulled up
i told him i would like to drive down
that road he made all sorts of ex-
cuses and frequently crossed himself
as he spoke this somewhat piqued
my curiosity so i asked him various
questions he answered fencingly
and repeatedly looked at his watch in
protest finally i said

  well johann i want to go down
this road i shall not ask you to come
unless you like but tell me why you
do not like to go that is all i ask
for answer he seemed to throw him-
self off the box so quickly did he
reach the groiind then he stretched
out his hands appealingly to me and
implored me not to go there was
just enough of english mixed with
the german for me to understand the
drift of his talk he seemed always
just about to tell me something-the
very idea of which evidently fright-
ened him but each time he puiled
himself up saying as he crossed him-
self walpurgis nachi

  i tried to argue with him but it
was difficult to argue with a man
when i did not know his language


weird tales

the advantage certainly rested with
him for although he began to speak
in english of a very crude and bro-
ken kind he always got excited and
broke into his native tongue-and
every time he did so he looked at his
watch then the horses became rest-
less and sniffed the air at this he
grew very pale and looking around
in a frightened way he suddenly
jumped forward took them by the
bridles and led them on some twenty
feet i followed and asked why he
had done this for answer he crossed
himself pointed to the spot we had
left and drew his carriage in the di-
rection of the other road indicating
a cross and said first in german
then in english buried him-him
what killed themselves

  i remembered the old custom of
burying suicides at cross-roads ah
i see a suicide iiow interesting
but for the life of me i could not
make out why the horses were fright-
ened

  whilst we were talking we heard a
soit of sound between a yelp and a
bark it was far away but the horses
got veiy restless and it took johann
all his time to quiet them he was
pale and said  it sounds like a wolf
-but yet there are no wolves here
now  

  no i said questioning him
isnt it long since the wolves were
so near the city

  long longhe answered in the
spring and summer but with the
snow the wolves have been here not so
long

  whilst he was petting the horses
and trying to quiet them dark clouds
drifted rapidly across the sky the
sunshine passed away and a breath
of cold wind seemed to drift past us
it was only a breath however and
more in the nature of a warning than
a fact for the sun came out brightly
again johann looked under his
lifted hand at the horizon and said

  the storm of snow he comes be-

fore long time then he looked at
his watch again and straightway
holding his reins firmly-for the
horses were still pawing the ground
restlessly and shaking their heads-
he climbed to his box as though the
time had come for proceeding on our
journey

  i felt a little obstinate and did not
at once get into the carriage

     tell me   i said   about this place
where the road leads   and i pointed
down

  again he crossed himself and mum-
bled a prayer before he answered
it is unholy

  what is unholy i enquired
  the village

  then there is a village

  no no no one lives there hun-
dreds of years

  my curiosity was piqued but
you said there was a village 

  there was

  where is it now

  whereupon he burst out into a long
story in german and english so
mixed up that i could not quite un-
derstand exactly what he said but
roughly i gathered that long ago
hundreds of years men had died
there and been buried in their graves
and sounds were heard under the clay
and when the graves were opened
men and women were found rosy with
life and their mouths red with blood
and so in haste to save their lives
aye and their souls-and here he
crossed himself those who were left
fled away to other places where the
living lived and the dead were dead
and not-not something else he was
evidently afraid to speak the last
words

  as he proceeded with his narration
he grew more and more excited it
seemed as if his imagination had got
hold of him and he ended in a per-
fect paroxysm of fear-white-faced
perspiring trembling and looking
round him as if expecting that some
dreadful presence would manifest
draculas guest



itself there in the bright sunshine on
the open plain finally in an agony
of desperation he cried walpurgis
nacht and pointed to the carriage
for me to get in

  all my english blood rose at this
and standing back i said

  you are afraid johann-you are
afraid go home i shall return
alone the walk will do me good
the carriage door was open i took
from the seat my oak walking-stick-
which i always carry on my holiday
excursions-and closed the door
pointing back to munich and said
go home johann-walpurgis
nacht doesnt concern englishmen

  the horses were now more restive
than ever and johann was trying to
hold them in while excitedly implor-
ing me not to do anything so foolish
i pitied the poor fellow he was so
deeply in earnest but all the same i
could not help laughing his en-
glish was quite gone now in
his anxiety he had forgotten that his
only means of making me understand
was to talk my language so he jab-
bered away in his native german it
began to be a little tedious after
giving the direction home i
turned to go down the cross-road into
the valley

  with a despairing gesture johann
turned his horses toward munich
i leaned on my stick and looked after
him he went slowly along the road
for a while then there came over the
crest of the hill a man tall and thin
i could see so much in the distance
when he drew near the horses they
began to jump and kick about then
to scream with terror johann could
not hold them in they bolted down
the road running away madly i
watched them out of sight then
looked for the stranger but i found
that he too was gone

vxith a light heart i turned down
v  the side road through the deep-
ening valley to which johann had ob-

jected there was not the slightest
reason that i could see for his ob-
jection and i daresay i tramped for
a couple of hours without thinking of
time or distance and certainly with-
out seeing a person or a house so
far as the place was concerned it was
desolation itself but i did not no-
tice this particularly till on turn-
ing a bend in the road i came upon a
scatteied fringe of wood then i rec-
ognized that i had been impressed un-
consciously by the desolation of the
region through which i had passed

  i sat down to rest myself and be-
gan to look around it struck me that
it was considerably colder than it had
been at the commencement of my
walk-a sort of sighing sound seemed
to be around me with now and then
high overhead a sort of muffled roar
looking upward i noticed that great
thick clouds were drifting rapidly
across the sky from north to south at
a great height there were signs of
coming storm in some lofty stratum of
the air i was a little chilly and
thinking that it was the sitting still
after the exercise of walking i re-
sumed my journey

  the ground i passed over was now
much more picturesque there were
no striking objects that the eye might
single out but in all there was a
charm of beauty i took little heed of
time and it was only when the deepen-
ing twilight forced itself upon me that
i began to think of how i should find
my way home the brightness of the
day had gone the air was cold and
the drifting of clouds high overhead
was more marked they were accom-
panied by a sort of far-away rushing
sound through which seemed to come
at intervals that mysterious cry which
the driver had said came from a wolf
for a while i hesitated i had said
i would see the deserted village so on
i went and presently came on a wide
stretch of open country shut in by
hills all around their sides were
covered with trees which spread down


weird tales

to the plain dotting in clumps the
gentler slopes and hollows which
showed here and there i followed
with my eye the winding of the road
and saw that it curved close to one of
the densest of these clumps and was
lost behind it

  as i looked there came a cold shiver
in the air and the snow began to fall
i thought of the miles and miles of
bleak country i had passed and then
hurried on to seek the shelter of the
wood in front darker and darker
grew the sky and faster and heavier
fell the snow till the earth before and
around me was a glistening white car-
pet the farther edge of which was lost
in misty vagueness the road was
here but crude and when on the
level its boundaries were not so
marked as when it passed through
the cuttings and in a little while i
found that i must have strayed from
it for i missed underfoot the hard
surface and my feet sank deeper
in the grass and moss then the wind
grew stronger and blew with ever in-
creasing force till i was fain to run
before it the air became icy-cold
and in spite of my exercise i began to
suffer the snow was now falling so
thicldy and whirling around me in
such rapid eddies that i could hardly
keep my eyes open every now and
then the heavens were torn asunder
by vivid lightning and in the flashes
i could see ahead of me a great mass
of trees chiefly yew and cypress all
heavily coated with snow

  i was soon amongst the shelter of
the trees and there in comparative
silence i could hear the rush of the
wind high overhead presently the
blackness of the storm had become
merged in the darkness of the night
by and by the storm seemed to be
passing away it now only came in
fierce puffs or blasts at such mo-
ments the weird sound of the wolf ap-
peared to be echoed by many similar
sounds around me

  now and again through the black

mass of drifting cloud came a strag-
ling ray of moonlight which lit up
the expanse and showed me that i
was at the edge of a dense mass of cy-
press and yew trees as the snow had
ceased to fall i walked out from the
shelter and began to investigate more
closely it appeared to me that
amongst so many old foundations as
i had passed there might be still
standing a house in which though in
ruins i could find some sort of shelter
for awhile as i skirted the edge of
the copse i found that a low wall en-
circled it and following this i pres-
ently found an opening here the cy-
presses formed an alley leading up to
a square mass of some kind of build-
ing just as i caught sight of this
however the drifting clouds obscured
the moon and i passed up the path in
darkness the wind must have grown
colder for i felt myself shiver as i
walked but there was hope of shel-
ter and i groped my way blindly on

  i stopped for there was a sudden
stillness the storm had passed and
perhaps in sympathy with natures
silence my heart seemed to cease to
beat but this was only momentarily
for suddenly the moonlight broke
through the clouds showing me that
i was in a graveyard and that the
square object before me was a great
massive tomb of marble as white as
the snow that lay on and all around
it with the moonlight there came
a fierce sigh of the storm which ap-
peared to resume its course with a
long low howl as of many dogs or
wolves i was awed and shocked and
felt the cold perceptibly grow upon
me till it seemed to grip me by the
heart then while the flood of moon-
light still fell on the marble tomb the
storm gave further evidence of re-
newing as though it was returning on
its track

  impelled by some sort of fascina-
tion i approached the sepulcher to
see what it was and why such
a thing stood alone in such a place
draculas guest



i walked around it and read over the
doric door in german

countess dolingen of gratz
in styria
sought and found death



  on the top of the tomb seemingly
driven through the solid marble-
for the structure was composed of a
few vast blocks of stone-was a great
iron spike or stake on going to the
back i saw graven in great russian
letters

tlie dead travel fast

  there was something so weird and
uncanny about the whole thing that
it gave me a turn and made me feel
quite faint i began to wish for the
first time that i had taken johanns
advice here a thought struck me
which came under almost mysterious
circumstances and with a terrible
shock this was walpurgis night

  walpurgis night when according
to the belief of millions of people the
devil was abroad-when the graves
were opened and the dead came forth
and walked when all evil things of
earth and air and water held revel
this very place the driver had spe-
cially shunned this was the depopu-
lated village of centuries ago this
was where the suicide lay and this
was the place where i was alone-un-
manned shivering with cold in a
shroud of snow with a wild storm
gathering again upon me it took
all my philosophy all the religion i
had been taught all my courage not
to collapse in a paroxysm of fright

  and now a perfeet tornado burst
upon me the ground shook as
though thousands of horses thundered
across it and this time the storm bore
on its icy wings not snow but great
hailstones which drove with such vio-
lence that they might have come from
the thongs of balearic slingers-hail-
stones that beat down leaf and
branch and made the shelter of the

cypresses of no more avail than if
their stems were standing corn

  at the first i had rushed to the
nearest tree but i was soon fain
to leave it and seek the only spot that
seemed to afford refuge the deep
doric doorway of the marble tomb
there crouching against the massive
bronze door i gained a certain
amount of protection from the beat-
ing of the hailstones for now they
only drove against me as they rico-
chetted from the ground and the side
of the marble

  as i leaned against the door it
moved slightly and opened inward
the shelter of even a tomb was wel-
come in that pitiless tempest and i
was about to enter it when there eame
a flash of forked lightning that lit up
the whole expanse of the heavens in
the instant as i am a living man i
saw as my eyes were turned into the
darkness of the tomb a beautiful
woman with rounded cheeks and red
lips seemingly sleeping on a bier
as the thunder broke overhead i was
grasped as by the hand of a giant and
hurled out into the storm the whole
thing was so sudden that before i
could realize the shock moral as well
as physical i found the hailstones
beating me down at the same time
i had a strange dominating feeling
that i was not alone i looked to-
ward the tomb just then there came
another blinding flash which seemed
to strike the iron stake that sur-
mounted the tomb and to pour
through to the earth blasting and
crumbling the marble as in a burst of
flame the dead woman rose for a mo-
ment of agony while she was lapped
in the flame and her bitter scream of
pain was drowned in the thunder-
crash the last thing i heard was this
mingling of dreadful sound as again
i was seized in the giant-grasp and
dragged away while the hailstones
beat on me and the air around seemed
reverberant with the howling of
wolves the last sight that i remem-


weird tales

ber was a vague white moving mass
as if all the graves around me had
sent out the phantoms of their sheeted
dead and that they were closing in on
me through the white cloudiness of
the driving hail

    

gradually there came a sort of
vague beginning of conscious-
ness then a sense of weariness that
was dreadful for a time i remem-
bered nothing but slowly my senses
returned my feet seemed positively
racked with pain yet i could not
move them they seemed to be
numbed there was an icy feeling at
the back of my neck and all down my
spine and my ears like my feet were
dead yet in torment but there was in
my breast a sense of warmth which
was by comparison delicious it was
as a nightmare-a physical night-
mare if one may use such an expres-
sion for some heavy weight on my
chest made it difficult for me to
breathe

  this period of semi-lethargy seemed
to remain a long time and as it faded
away i must have slept or swooned
then came a sort of loathing like the
first stage of sea-sickness and a wild
desire to be free from something-i
knew not what a vast stillness en-
veloped me as though all the world
were asleep or dead-only broken by
the low panting as of some animal
close to me i felt a warm rasping at
my throat then came a consciousness
of the awful truth which chilled me
to the heart and sent the blood surg-
ing up through my brain some great
animal was lying on me and now lick-
ing my throat i feared to stir for
some instinct of prudence bade me lie
still but the brute seemed to realize
that there was now some change in
me for it raised its head through my
eyelashes i saw above me the two
great flaming eyes of a gigantic wolf
its sharp white teeth gleamed in the
gaping red mouth and i could feel

its hot breath fierce and acrid upon

me

  for another spell of time i remem-
bered no more then i became con-
scious of a low growl followed by a
yelp renewed again and again then
seemingly very far away i heard a
holloa holloa as of many voices
calling in unison cautiously i
raised my head and looked in the di-
rection whence the sound came but
the cemetery blocked my view the
wolf still continued to yelp in a
strange way and a red glare began to
move around the grove of cypresses
as though following the sound as the
voices drew closer the wolf yelped
faster and louder i feared to make
either sound or motion nearer came
the red glow over the white pall
which stretched into the darkness
around me

  then all at once from beyond the
trees there came at a trot a troop of
horsemen bearing torches the wolf
rose from my breast and made for the
cemetery i saw one of the horsemen
soldiers by their caps and long mili-
tary cloaks raise his carbine and
take aim a companion knocked up
his arm and i heard the ball whizz
over my head he had evidently
taken my body for that of the wolf
another sighted the animal as it slunk
away and a shot followed then at a
gallop the troop rode forward-
some toward me others following the
wolf as it disappeared amongst the
snow-clad cypresses

  as they drew nearer i tried to
move but was powerless although i
could see and hear all that went
on around me two or three of the
soldiers jumped from their horses and
knelt beside me one of them raised
my head and placed his hand over
my heart

  good news comrades he cried

	 his heart still beats  

  then some brandy was poured
down my throat it put vigor into
me and i was able to open my eyes
draculas guest



fully and look around lights and
shadows were moving among the trees
and i heard men call to one another
they drew together uttering fright-
ened - exclamations and the lights
flashed as the others came pouring
out of the cemetery pell-mell like men
possessed when the farther ones
came close to us those who were
around me asked them eagerly

  well have you found him

  the reply rang out hurriedly
no no come away quick-
quick this is no place to stay and
on this of all nights

  what was it was the question
asked in all manner of keys the an-
swer came variously and all indefi-
nitely as though the men were moved
by some common impulse to speak
yet were restrained by some common
fear from giving their thoughts

    it-it-indeed   gibbered one
whose wits had plainly given out for
the moment

  a wrolf-and yet not a wolf an-
other put in shudderingly

  no use trying for him without
the sacred bullet a third remarked
in a more ordinary manner

  serve us right for coming out on
this night truly we have earned
our thousand marks   were the ejacu-
lations of a fourth

  there was blood on the broken
marble another said after a pause-
the lightning never brought that
there and for him-is he safe
look at his throat see comrades
the wolf has been lying on him and
keeping his blood warm

  the officer looked at my throat and
replied

  he is all right the skin is not
pierced what does it all mean  we
should never have found him but for
the yelping of the wolf

  what became of it asked the
man who was holding up my head
and who seemed the least panic-
stricken of the party for his hands
were steady and without tremoi on

his sleeve was the chevron of a petty
officer

  it went to its home answered
the man whose long face was pallid
and who actually shook with terror as
he glanced around him fearfully
there are graves enough there iu
which it may lie come comrades-
come quickly let us leave this
cursed spot	v

  the officer raised me to a sitting
posture as he uttered a word of com-
mand then several men placed me
upon a horse he sprang to the sad-
dle behind me took me in his arms
gave the word to advance and turn-
ing our faces away from the cy-
presses we rode away in swift mili-
tary order

  as yet my tongue refused its office
and i was perforce silent i must
have fallen asleep for the next thing
i remembered was finding myself
standing up supported by a soldier
on each side of me it was almost
broad daylight and to the north a red
streak of sunlight was reflected like a
path of blood over the waste of snow
the officer was telling the men to say
nothing of what they had seen ex-
cept that they found an english
stranger guarded by a large dog

dog that was no dog cut in the
man who had exhibited such fear i
think i know a wolf when i see one
the young officer answered calmly
i said a dog

  dog reiterated the other ironi-
cally it was evident that his cour-
age was rising with the sun and
pointing to me he said look at his
throat is that the work of a dog
master   

  instinctively i raised my hand to
my throat and as i touched it i cried
out in pain the men crowded round
to look some stooping down from
their saddles and again there came
the calm voice of the young officer
a dog as i said if aught else
were said we should only be laughed
at


weird tales

 i was then mounted behind a
trooper and we rode on into the sub-
urbs of munich here we came
across a stray carriage into which i
was lifted and it was driven off to the
quatre saisons-the young officer
accompanying me whilst a trooper
followed with his horse and the
others rode off to their barracks

xiien we arrived herr delbriick
  rushed so quickly down the
steps to meet me that it was apparent
he had been watching within tak-
ing me by both hands he solicitously
led me in the officer saluted me and
was turning to withdraw when i
recognized his purpose and insisted
that he should come to my rooms
over a glass of wine i warmly
thanked him and his brave comrades
for saving me he replied simply
that he was more than glad and that
herr delbriick had at the first taken
steps to make all the searching party
pleased at which ambiguous utter-
ance the maitre dhotel smiled while
the officer pleaded duty and with-
drew

  but herr delbriick i enquired
how and why was it that the sol-
diers searched for me

  he shrugged his shoulders as if
in depreciation of his own deed as he
replied

  i was so fortunate as to obtain
leave from the commander of the regi-
ment in which i served to ask for
volunteers

 but how did you know i was
lost i asked

  the driver came hither with the
remains of his carriage which had
been upset when the horses ran
away  

  but surely you would not send
a search-party of soldiers merely on
this account

  oh no he answered but even
before the coachman arrived i had
this telegram from the boyar whose
guest you are   and he took from his
pocket a telegram which he handed to
me and i read

bistritz

  be careful of my guest-his safety ia
most precious to me should aught hap-
pen to him or if he be missed spare noth-
ing to find him and ensure his safety he
is english and therefore adventurous there
are often dangers from snows and wolves
and night lose not a moment if you sus-
pect harm to him i answer your zeal with
my fortune

                        dracula

  as i held the telegram in my hand
the room seemed to whirl around me
and if the attentive maitre dhotel
had not caught me i think i should
have fallen there was something so
strange in all this something so weird
and impossible to imagine that there
grew on me a sense of my being in
some way the sport of opposite
forces-the mere vague idea of which
seemed in a way to paralyze me i
was certainly under some form of
mysterious protection from a dis-
tant country had come in the very
nick of time a message that took me
out of the danger of the snow-sleep
and the jaws of the wolf

so long baffled them on the shoulder
of his purple robe they saw a strand
of blue-black hair on his forehead
was a rosy imprint as of the kiss of
heavily rouged lips

 come to life growled the
grand master with nervous gruffness
then remembering his mission
where is she

  he shook the sleeper by the shoul-
der

  lord christ he shrieked noth-
ing but skin and bones

  nothing but skin and bones
echoed a mocking deathly bitter
voice from the shadows of the far
comer of the shrine the infidels
daughter wraithlike shadowy as a
wisp of smoke confronted them
fools meddlers continued that
passionless cold voice to save him
from your stupidity which would
have killed his soul too many years in
advance of his body i took the
life of him who evoked me from the
shadows and gave me human form
so take what is left of him    skin
and bones

  her laugh was like the touch of a
frosty blade    like the whisperings
of an evil spirit

  the grand master was the first to
reach the door he tripped on his
saffron robe fell headlong down the
stairs and before sunrise he died
babbling of skin and bones and tf a
girl and her poisonous evil laugh

  as the sun rose ismeddin whose
tough skull had survived the blow
that had stunned him emerged from
behind the winged bull where the in-
vaders had tossed him

  the old man knew better than to
touch the form of his master or to
disturb the curiously wrought silver
diadem that lay in the hollow of
landons shoulder

    he found her in spite of me

it was the greatest shock

of my life to hear her play

-how had she found time to practice

      ell jim-i told you i had a
      surprise for you

         she beamed at her husband
delighted to see how surprised-and
pleased-he was

  and i was astonished too quite
casually she had gone to the piano sat
down-and played  played beautifully
-though i had never seen her touch
a piano before neither of us could
conceal our curiosity

  how did you ever do it her hus-
band asked when did you find time
to practice v

 and who is your
teacher i added

  wait wait she
laughed one question
at a time i have no
teacher that is no pri-
vate teacher and i do
my practicing between
dishes

  no teacher

  no- learned to play
the piano an entirely
new way-without a
teacher you see all my
life i wanted to play
some musical instru-
ment i thought id
never learn how to play
though-for i havent
much time to spare and
i thought it would take
long hours of hard
work and i thought it would be ex-
pensive too

  well it is hard work and it is ex-
pensive i said why i have a sis-
ter   

  i know she laughed but i
learned to play the piano through
the new simplified method some
time ago i saw an announcement of
the u s school of music it told
how a young man had learned to play
the piano during his spare time with-
out a teacher i found that thousands
of others had learned to play their

favorite musical instruments in this
same delightful easy way and so i
decided to enroll for a course in piano
playing

  but you didnt tell me anything
about it jim said

  well you see that -was my big
surprise ever since i received my
first lesson ive been practicing by
myself-during the day while youve
been away at business i turned my
spare moments between housekeeping
and shopping into something pleasant
and profitable

  if you planned to sur-
prise me-youve cer-
tainly succeeded said
jim
