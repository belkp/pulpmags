prologue

ake rule sheriff of fort creek
county and his deputy kansas
casey were riding out of fare-
well in the light of early morning
their route led them past the rear of the
stage companys corrals

  beats- where a drunkardll sleep

commented kansas indicating with a jerk
of his thumb the prostrate form of a man
sprawling beside the discarded reach and
hind wheels of a freight wagon

  dont it jake said carelessly-then
swung his horse swiftly for there was an
unlifelike cast in the spread-eagled body

  the sheriff dismounted and knelt beside
caseys drunkard the breast of the
latters blue flannel shirt was stiff with
what had dried upon it jakes expert
fingers opened and spread apart the shirt

  my gawd exclaimed kansas who was
young and therefore emotional

  looks like that chest had been run
through a sewin machine observed jake
throats cut half-through he supple-
mented with an eye to detail

  his face whispered kansas in a dry
voice

  for the dead man did not have any face
that is a face his friends could recognize
the features had been smashed and beaten
to a pulpy flatness

  who is he asked kansas

  hes wearin rufe thompsons cloes
replied the sheriff guess you dunno
rufe hes sile thompsons brother
siles manager o the slash f outfit over
south o seymour i dunno him myself
an i didnt know rufe either till i had
a drink with him last night rufe only
sifted in yestday

  while the sheriff talked his hands had
been searching the dead mans clothing
he brought to light and laid at one side a
silver watch a six-shooter in a shoulder
holster a fifty-cent piece a quarter and an
unsealed letter addressed to scotty mac-
kenzie of the flying m-that ranch is
situated in the valley of the dogsoldier
beyond paradise eend jake opened and
read the letter

  kansas drew the revolver from its holster
and examined the cylinder then he

	adventure

extracted the cylinder and squinted down
the guns long barrel

  glean he announced five car-
tridges in the cylinder

  oh he didnt have no more chance than
a ory-eyed injun said jake rule and
tapped the letter with a blunt forefinger
its rufe shore-enough this here to
scotty is all about a bunch o horses sile
wants to buy wonder why they pulled
his shirt-tail out of his pants he added
irrelevantly

  maybe he done it when he was dyin
suggested kansas

  maybe yuh cant tell take his feef
will yuh kansas

the stranger

xho is he queried piney jackson
  the blacksmith leaning comfortably
against the off-jamb of his wide doorway

  i dunno replied windy taylor
slouching on an up-ended bucket beside the
cooling tub ive never seen him before
me neither declared the blacksmith
and scratched his shoulders heifer-wise on
the wood

  whadda yuh wanna know for list-
lessly

  piney jackson surveyed the puncher
with contempt

  aint you double diamond a fellers
got no curiosity he demanded

  not a-cure grinned windy we

aint got no time we work we do we
dont sit on our hunkers come day go day
shoe a mule once a year like some jiggers
i know

  is that so snorted the blacksmith
and fairly upset his slow-witted brain for a
suitable and crushing retort the latter
failing to materialize he dodged back to
the main question alla same id like to
know who mister high pockets is

  why dontcha ask him yuh dunno
he might tell yuh

  piney jackson treated mr taylors
flippancy with the disdain it deserved and
continued to gaze diagonally across the
street at the object of his curiosity which
object was a tall lanky man occupying
one of the two chairs on the sidewalk
beneath the wooden awning of bill laineys
hotel one of the chairs was filled to

overflowing by that mountain of lazy flesh
bill lainey himself lainey as was his
custom dozed with abandon his snores
and gurgles were not audible to the men
in the doorway of the blacksmith shop
but they knew what he was doing

  the stranger was not sleeping chair
tilted back against the wall spurred heels
hooked on a rung he stared straight in
front of him with a pair of humorous and
washed-out gray eyes apparently his
scrutiny was directed upon dave smiths
pony tied to the well-chewed post in front
of the smith residence after a time the
stranger swept the figures of the blacksmith
and mr taylor with a calm impersonal
glance and then looked out across the hot
flat to where the trail from marysville and
the south dropped down the slope of indian
ridge a cloud of dust was on the trail
the northbound stage was coming in

  the strangers eyes switched back to
the pony tied to the post he fished with
lean brown fingers in a pocket of his vest
produced the makings and rolled a cigaret
employing for that purpose both hands

  when he had blown out his first deep
inhale the white teeth beneath the stubby
brown mustache showed in a slow half-
smile a smile that faded as slowly as it came
for the stranger was missing nothing of
messrs jacksons and taylors studiedly
unobtrusive stares and they amused him
those stares he had played draw with
the blacksmith and two of the latters
friends in the happy heart the evening
before and he had taken their money away
from them this also had amused him a
beneficent providence having blessed him
with a spacious talent for poker and its
by-products he was frequently enabled to
derive from life much innocent pleasure
and more coin of the realm which was
proper

  a trickle of passers-by crossed the
strangers field of vision mike flynn the
one-legged owner of the blue pigeon store
with a seafaring roll in his walk that even
a brass-bound mahogany pegleg could not
eradicate plump mrs rule the sheriffs
wife intent on dotted calico and baking-
powder the amiable owner of the canton
restaurant tall sing luey resplendent in
black silk trousers and embroidered over-
shirt meditatively sucking the mouth-
piece of his yard-long silver-mounted pipe
intent on heaven knew what dream of his
high pockets



own home-town and pale-faced mr tom
stute frock-coated wearing a shirt of
many pleats and his perennial smile
clean-shaven handsome debonair to a
degree mr stute proprietor and manager
of the dewdrop dance-hall was a picture
to fill any ones eye

  the stranger surveyed the march past
of mr stute from beneath half-closed
eyelids he was not sure that he liked
mr stute shooting at random as it
were he believed he preferred that in-
scrutable celestial sing luey to mr
stute there was that about the dance-
hall person a subtle cocksureness among
other little traits that grated the
stranger had not the pleasure of mr
stutes acquaintance nor did he greatly
care for chinamen but he had a vast and
childlike faith in his own instinct

  a thudding patter drummed across the
heat waves of the flat the stranger
looked southward along the trail a quar-
ter-mile away dimly visible through rolling
clouds of dust the legs of the stage horses
were twinkling in a frantic gallop came
the pistol-like crack of a whip-once
twice and again whisky jim was
encouraging his teams whisky jim
whooped a series of shrill whoops

  must be haulin a woman the stranger
wise as to the practise of stage-drivers
concluded

  creaking and swaying curtains flapping
the stage whirled past with a hearty
shout whisky jim straightened a leg on
the brake lever and swayed back on the
bunched reins the stage ground to a halt
in front of the stage station whisky jim
set the brake and climbed down the
stranger watched lazily whisky jim
opened the stage door stretched in a long
arm and dragged out a large valise

  ladies first bawled whisky jim as a
trousered leg appeared the foot feeling
for the step

  the leg and foot jerked backward dis-
appeared and then slowly hesitatingly
the slim figure of a girl in dusty dark blue
stepped out and down she was a little
thing this girl the stranger decided as
he looked at her standing there beside her
great valise that she possessed the smallest
feet he had ever seen

  the owner of the trousered leg that had
annoyed whisky jim scuttled out with a
cautious eye to the stage driver and van-

ished within the happy heart saloon
whisky jim turned to help the wells fargo
guard with the express box and the mail-
bags the girl stood beside her valise and
gazed upon the false fronts of farewell

  dont she belong to nobody the
stranger asked himself and removed his
heels from the chair rung

   mr stute hurried out into the street and
approached the girl mr stute achieved
a low bow and a hat flourish it must be
said that mr stute had title to certain
airs and graces mr stute his head bent
deferentially spoke at some length to the
girl the stranger could not hear what he
was saying

   dance-hall floozie he said to himself
and rehooked his heels must belong to
stute

  he set himself to the rolling of a fresh
cigaret he had lost all interest in the girl

   but the interest returned full force when
presently came toward him along the side-
walk mr stute and the girl now the
stranger had a fair view of her face it
was not a beautiful face but it was a sweet
face and the expression made it very lovely
there was strength in the wide mouth and
firm chin there was sadness in the wide-
set dark eyes as she glanced at the stranger
in passing promptly he revised his pre-
vious estimate

  she never was in a dance-hall in her
life he told himself

  mr stute awakened bill lainey and in-
formed the hotel proprietor that the lady
desired a room

   not an expensive room put in the girl
i-i cant pay very much

  rooms all the same price said bill
lainey heaving himself erect theys
only two-eight beds in each dollar a bed
a day

  at which the girl looked blank and mr
stute drew mr lainey aside and whispered
in his ear

  all right wheezed bill and spoke to
the girl yuh can have the young-uns
room four-bits a day

  four-bits repeated the girl uncom-
prehendingly

   fifty cents explained bill lainey

   i dont understand if beds are one dollar
a day how-

  thats all right mr stute assured
her clapping bill on the shoulder thats
a-all right my friend mister lainey is

to tourists you know mister lainey did
not know you were a tourist-at first

 but-

  dont think of it further madam the
matter is settled you must be tired

  the girl attempted to thank mr stute
he raised a deprecating hand

  dont mention it madam no trouble
at all delighted to have been of service
i may see you again-later i hope-i
may thank you bill heres the ladys
bag

  lainey and the girl went into the hotel
mr stute curling his mustache with satis-
fied fingers strolled away toward his dance-
hall the stranger watched the smoke curl
upward from the end of his cigaret

  an yore gonna see her again are yuh
he said under his breath i wonder
whyfor

chapter ii

a job

	 he stranger saw the girl at supper

     she sat opposite an empty chair on
either hand the few diners stray punch-
ers and the stage station employees ate
with diffidence they were not accus-
tomed to women of the girls species

  the stranger surreptitiously watched her
while she ate he was glad that she had
removed her hat he enjoyed looking at
her hair it was so darkly brown and
smooth and shiny the girls appetite
could have been better she merely pecked
at the sowbelly and beans but she ate all
her canned tomatoes and drank two cups
of the terrifically strong coffee

  the meal over the girl disappeared
the stranger in his chair on the sidewalk
could hear her moving about her room
after a time all sound of movement ceased
later the stranger thought he heard stifled
sobbing but he could not be sure

  came then through the dusk mr stute
walking rapidly he entered the hotel
bill lainey was indoors cleaning his rifle

  wheres the little lady inquired mr
stute

  in her room replied bill to the
accompaniment of a squirted oil cans
double click

  ask her if shell see me

  the lainey feet shuffled across the floor
the lainey knuckles rapped on a door

  gent to see yuh maam said bill
hes the gent brung yuh here-mister
tom stute

  the stranger leaned across his chair arm
and nearer the doorway he could not
catch the girls answer her voice was
pitched too low

  says she cant see nobody now bill
told mr stute

  mr stute came out and went away
the set of his head and shoulders hinted
at displeasure the stranger waited a long
five minutes then he followed in the
wake of the dance-hall proprietor to the
latters place of business

  the shank of the evening was but be-
ginning in the dewdrop the fiddler on
his table was sawing out the merry strains
of zip coon in perfunctory fashion
windy taylor was endeavoring to waltz
with a painted blonde and making a boggy
ford of it it was evident that the double
diamond a puncher had had several the
blonde was making fun of him as they
slid past the doorway she expertly dis-
engaged herself and propelled windy to the
bar they drank and the blonde added
another check to her string

  there were five women in the dewdrop
dance-hall good-looking and light-footed
females all of them well-assorted too-a
pair of blondes two brunettes and a red-
haired girl for mr stute knew the value
of display advertising

  the stranger draped himself against the
bar and poured out a modest two fingers

  buy me a drink dearie

  it was the red-haired girl a full-bosomed
cyprian with excellent teeth she was
nudging his elbow

  help yoreself he said and eyed her
indifferently

  les dance she invited when she had
swallowed her liquor

  i dunno how he equivocated

  ill teach yuh she laid a plump hand
on his arm

  yuh dunno what yore sayin he
grinned once a girl tried to teach me to
dance an shes been walkin lame ever
since

  thats all right she giggled come
along

  but the stranger would not and the red-
haired creature left him to essay her wiles
high pockets



on tom barton of the hogpen outfit the
stranger sipped his whisky and stared into
the long mirror behind the bar he could
see the reflection of mr stute in the mirror
mr stute was talking to one longhorn
simms a swarthy citizen with a broken
nose

  mr simms was a person of some local
reputation he ran the games in the
happy heart saloon he had killed two
men in the way of his profession and wore
derringers in his vest-pockets the name
longhorn fitted he was excessively hard
now he was smiling-as the wolf smiles
when it licks its jaws mr stute was
chuckling he was apparently telling mr
simms a story both pithy and pointed
zip coon drowned his words

  the stranger moved across the room to a
window adjacent to the gambler and the
story-teller he put his hand on the sill
and looked out into the night

  tomorrow ill turn the trick mr
stute was saying i dont know but that
ill keep her myself-for a while shes too
good for the floor now

  yuhll have to work it easy-like
thus longhorn simms spitting at a crack
easys where i live

  if shes good like yuh think it wont be
no cinch i knowed a good woman once
couldnt budge her i know

  ill budge this one she hasnt any
money to speak of and she hasnt a
friend in the territory i got that much
out of her do you see it not a friend in
the territory

  an youll be her friend the wolfish
smile on the mouth of mr simms turned
sarcastic

  i sure will

  betcha fifty yuh get the mitten
make it a hundred and give me two
days

  shore a hundred an two days goes
les irrigate

  the two crossed to the bar the
stranger sat down on the window sill
ten minutes later he left the dance-hall
and went to the happy heart to play stud

  the stranger rose late the following
morning he was alone in the eight-
bedded room the other guests two
punchers and a stray-man were at break-
fast when he had pulled on his boots and
settled his hair with a sweep of his hand
he took his six-shooter from its holster

and drew out the cylinder he inspected
the five cartridges replaced the cylinder
and carefully settled the hammer on the
empty chamber he shoved the weapon
into its holster buckled on the belt and
tied down the holster as every one
knows tying down a holster makes for a
sure draw gun-fighters employ this pro-
cedure extensively

  which being done the stranger went to
his war-bags where they lay on the floor
opened them and pulled from beneath
his extra shirt the mate to the six-shooter
on his right leg this firearm he treated
precisely as he had the other save that
when it was in readiness for action he
shoved it down inside the waistband of his
trousers so that it cuddled his body slightly
ahead of the right hip-bone

  from the other half of his war-bags he
produced a heavy-bladed thin-handled
bowie this knife he inserted in a leather
sheath cunningly sewn into the back of his
vest high up at the neck on the right-hand
side then he put on the vest wriggled
his shoulders till the bowie lay snugly where
it should and went down to breakfast

  the girl was the sole occupant of the
dining-room when he pulled out his
chair she returned his greeting timidly
her eye on her plate the stranger ate
hurriedly but the girl finished before he
did and went out into the street

  the stranger set down his half-emptied
coffee-cup and walked to the doorway
standing well back he watched her enter the
blue pigeon store he waited till she
came out and started back toward the
hotel then he slid through the doorway
and dropped into his accustomed chair
when she passed him on her way in he saw
that she held in her hand a few spools of
thread and a paper of needles

  gonna do a lil sewin he told himself
shes gonna stay some while anyhow

  in a few minutes he heard the snip-snip
of scissors he smiled his slow half-smile
and rolled a cigaret

  bill lainey shuffled past the corner of
the hotel

  yore hoss an dolans mule is fightin
he wheezed an me ive gotta go to the
store for the wife

  the stranger swore and ran round the
building to the corral on the way he
picked up a five-foot length of two-by-four
bill lainey had told the truth rear


adventure

strike whirl kick and recover the mule
and the strangers hammer-headed yellow
were going it tooth and hoof handling
the two-by-four as if it were a lath the
stranger hammered dolans mule and his
own horse on the nose with charming im-
partiality but it was a grudge fight and
both brutes were red-eyed with rage
they minded him not at all at first and
only his natural agility saved him from
being brained

  he beat them apart at last whacked
them soundly over their rumps and drove
them to their respective corners he
climbed upon the top bar of the gate and
sat the two-by-four across his knees
awaiting the return of the fighting spirit
but the two animals had had enough
they were content to sulk where they stood
and tenderly shake their aching heads
the stranger watched them grimly for a
space then he dropped the two-by-four
climbed down and returned to his chair
in front of the hotel

i the dewdrop dance-hall lay on
irjlthe same side of main street as
labj laineys hotel almost directly
opposite the dance-hall was sing lueys
canton restaurant the dance-halls win-
dows and doors were all open front and
rear tall sing luey standing in his door-
way had a fairly comprehensive view of
the interior of that dance-hall sing luey
sucking his long pipe which no one had ever
seen him smoke stood motionless his legs
widespread

  suddenly he stepped down on the side-
walk and shuffled across the street in the
direction of laineys hotel in front of
dalys place he halted and became deeply
absorbed in the antics of dolans chained
bear as it vigorously hunted itself for fleas
a few minutes later sing luey passed on
and paused beside the strangers chair

  fine day said sing luey

  the stranger stared at the chinaman in
frank surprise sing lueys accent was
not the chinese accent to which he was
accustomed he nodded curtly

  yeah said the stranger

  sing luey smiled balmily and caressed
the tiny bowl of his pipe

  i have some very fine li-chi nuts went
on sing luey they arrived from china
only last week i should like you to try
those nuts

  the stranger continued to stare the
yellow face beamed down upon him

  we do not all talk the pidgin he said
gently

  i can see that easy but-

  those nuts are-excellent

  the right eyelid of the chinaman half-
dropped

  i dunno what yore drivin at puzzled
the stranger

  you need not come beyond the doorway
if you do not wish sing luey persisted
if you do not come you may be sorry
he broke off his inscrutable eyes holding
those of the stranger you will come
please he added softly and turned on his
slippered heel

  the stranger got unhurriedly to his feet
he hitched up his trousers and kicked the
kinks out of his long legs briskly he
crossed the street caught up with sing
luey passed him and entered the canton
the dining-room was empty from the
kitchen came the sound of shifted pots and
pans and the shush of disturbed water
the stranger leaned back against the wall

  in slipped sing luey and stood beside a
front window his eyes on the dance-hall
opposite

  about them nuts- began the stranger

  perhaps the nuts can wait the celestial
suggested smoothly perhaps something
else can not wait

  say lookit here the stranger was
becoming annoyed

  i think that a woman needs the help of
a man said sing luey quietly ignoring
the others ire the woman that arrived
by stage last night he continued speaking
rapidly mr stute has her in the dance-
hall

  them nuts shore can wait observed
the stranger and departed in haste

  the stranger walked quickly through the
dance-hall doorway the girl and mr
stute were the sole occupants of the large
front room even the bartender was
absent from his post mr stute seemed
annoyed at the strangers entry he
glanced sharply at the intruder then
as if by an afterthought smiled slightly
and nodded to him the stranger went
to the bar mr stute continued his con-
versation with the girl

  you say you can play the piano said
mr stute fine ive ordered one

high pockets

employees nice congenial people and ill

  she says shed like to see the bill o
ladin for that piano first the stranger
answered for her

  wha-what do you mean mr stute
caught off guard for once in his life could
not help but stutter

  figure it out said the stranger

  mr stute stepped in front of the girl
she stood back eying the stranger un-
certainly

  what are you trying to do demanded
mr stute

  the stranger leaning against the bar
had hooked his right thumb in the armhole
of his vest his left hand was close to the
waistband of his trousers

  if yore gonna take a chance get out o
line with the lady advised the stranger
pleasantly

  i never take chances replied mr
stute

  so ive heard thus the stranger
easily

  i dont intend to now

  thats real bright o yuh alla same
spose yuh move a yard to yore left itll
be more friendly

  mr stute hesitated then he laughed
hardily and moved the required yard

  maam said the stranger without
removing his eye from mr stute yuh
wouldnt wanna job in this shack it aint
no place for a lady not nohow stute was
funnin yuh i guess wasnt yuh mister
stute

  why see here- began mr stute

  just say yes interrupted the stranger

  again mr stute hesitated

  i can see what yore thinkin said the
stranger dont gamble with me i dont
feel like gamblin not today talk
quick

  the pupils of the washed-out gray eyes
were narrowed to pin-points mr stute

turned to the girl she had shrunk back
against the wall she looked frightened to
death

  this gentleman seems to be a friend of
yours said mr stute he apparently
speaks with authority i will not question
his right now at a more favorable time
perhaps i regret to say madam that my
offer is no longer open mr stute turned
from the girl and added looking sidewise
at the stranger the audience will please
pass out quietly

  it will indorsed the stranger both
of it after you maam

  the girl went out silently her hands
twisted together in front of her the
stranger oozed backward through the door-
way on the sidewalk he paused and
addressed the immobile mr stute

  im glad you listened to reason he
said

  keep feeling that way as long as you
can mr stute tossed back

  the stranger grinned and nodded and
hurried to overtake the girl when he
reached her side she looked up into his face
her eyes were shining with unshed tears
her upper lip was caught between her
teeth

  will yuh gimme a chance to explain
the stranger begged earnestly

  pitifully she nodded

   tsall right then theys a place out
back o laineys corral where we can sit on
a old wagon-box an be right private les
go there

chapter iii

      	sing luey

the stranger was not an adept at ex-
planations-especially an explanation
of this character to a woman of this class
but he did the best he knew and did it
well the girl kept silence while he spoke
her eyes on his face when he finished she
said in a low tone

  ive heard of dance-halls of course
but i never thought they could be so very
dreadful if-if a girl was careful i guess
i didnt know he seemed very kind
gents like that are-for a while take
my word for it maam hes a snake an
he dont rattle

  i dont know what to do i must-
must do something


adventure

  was that terrormingled with the sadness
in her eyes the stranger could not be
certain

  dont yuh know nobody yuh can go to
he asked gently

  she shook her head and looked down at
the hands lying idly in her lap the
stranger pushed back his hat and raised
perplexed eyes to the sky here was a
pleasant problem

  im a stranger here like you he said
at last but ill get yuh a job or break a
leg that is if yore shore yuh want to
stay here

  ill have to stay here she said dully
i mean this place is as good as any

  she glanced at him apprehensively

  he nodded reassuringly

  yuh mustnt be afraid he told her
nobody wont bother yuh no more ill
fix that

im not afraid she smiled wanly
thats right dontcha worry now
everythins gonna turn out fine as frawgs
hair in august an thats average fine he
added whimsically

  she smiled at him again but the smile
faded quickly she shivered a little and it
was a hot day

  i dont know your name said she
shyly

  henderson - bill hendersons my
name

  mine is joy blythe

  thats shore a right pretty name
sounds kind o happy-like

  does it

  shore does now lookit here miss
blythe id go into the hotel if i was you
an sort o stay there me im gonna
frisk round an rustle you a real job
youre very good

  which remark struck mr henderson
speechless and made him all warm within
he walked awkwardly at her side to the
door of the hotel and stood in silence as
she went in when he heard the door
of her room close he sought out bill lainey
who was dolefully peeling potatoes under
the kitchen window

  the wifes ailin today said bill
apologetically an i gotta help her out
an im needin sleep bad i always sleep
in the mornins cant seem to get enough
at night runnin a hotel is shore work
aint it a fright assented henderson
and lowered his voice the lil lady

inside is a friend o mine an id take it
as a personal favor if yuhd keep an eye
skinned for her kind o lookout her
game when i aint round an lemme know
if any jigger bothers her i aint aimin
to have her bothered

  that tom stute observed mr lainey
and spat upon the ground significantly

  he wont bother her

  oh said mr lainey and looked wise
i want for her to keep on livin in that
room o hers as long as she likes-at four-
bits a day

  tom stute was gonna pay the differ-
ence

im payin the difference see an
dont you never let her find it out neither
i wont lainey assured him hastily
the differencell be a dollar four-bits
heres forty-five wheels when thats
gone lemme know maybe now i wont be
in town on the dot but ill be round later
all right an im expectin to find her here
shell be here said mr lainey and
dropped the gold pieces chinkingly into his
pockets

  mr henderson nodded pulled his hat
straight and set about winning that job

  his opening move was rather odd he
did not return to the street instead he
walked along the haphazard rears of the
buildings fronting on the thoroughfare
he kept his shoulder to the wall as much as
possible his manner was wary

  near the collection of cribs at the back
of the dance-hall he paused from the
cribs drifted the sound of feminine voices
wrangling drearily one with another hen-
derson turned at right angles to his former
course and slid into the narrow space
between the side wall of the dewdrop and
dolans warehouse he ducked beneath
the windows till he reached the one nearest
the street

  beneath this window he halted and bent
double affected to fasten a spur this
for the benefit of any one passing in the
street within the dance-hall he heard
the voices of mr stute and his bartender
mr stute was damning the world in general
and a certain man in particular the
bartender was indorsing every word with
the utmost heartiness

  guess theys only the two of em
hazarded henderson

  he felt of his weapons dodged round the
corner of the dance-hall and entered by
high pockets

n

way of the front door mr stute and the
bartender were alone in the room they
made no movement for henderson had
jerked the gun on his leg and a remarkably
cold and washed-out gray eye was glinting
at them along the sights

  you said somethin about the audience
passin out quietly a while ago observed
mr henderson spose you be the audi-
ence now an pass out like you said after me
i dont mean you barkeep just you
stand right still an keep yore hands flat
on the bar thats right come along
stute

  he backed streetward mr stute hands
held level with his shoulders followed as
if hypnotized henderson tolled mr stute
along the sidewalk to dolans warehouse
in front of which he halted

  now you an me can have a talk mr
henderson said genially

  you have the drop fretted mr stute

  yuh noticed it grinned mr hender-
son yuh wasnt expectin me quite so
soon huh i just guessed id sift in an
see was yuh holdin any hard feelins

  all i want is an even break snapped
mr stute

  yuh got it feller henderson slipped
the six-shooter into its holster

which was enough to satisfy the
most exacting of persons it satis-
fied mr stute his hand streaked
to the gun-butt under his coat hen-
dersons left hand moved slightly his
vest flew open there was a spitting flash
and a bang and mr stute his undis-
charged weapon shot out of his fingers
staggered sidewise to the warehouse wall
holding a numbed forearm mr hen-
derson gazed upon mr stute with interest

  the hand is quicker than the eye
said mr henderson succinctly an thats
somethin else yuhve learned today
he stepped close in to mr stute and stared
into that temporarily subdued persons
close-set eyes the lil lady at laineys
aint to be bothered stute he continued
in a harsh whisper walk round her
walk way round her the next time it
might not be yore gun

  came then the marshal red-faced and
out of breath

  whats the matter he demanded

  mr henderson surveyed the officer
frostily

  i dont see nothin the matter said he
do you

  the marshal a man of small force
glanced uncertainly from henderson to
mr stute and back to henderson

  this here gun-play- began the
marshal

  was an even break interrupted
mr henderson smoothly stute aint
scratched if he takes care of his health
hed ought to five a long while an get fat
an sassy like the rest of us yore late
marshal right now ive got business
he turned his back on mr stute and
the marshal and diagonalled across the
street to the happy heart saloon the
score or more witnesses of the foregoing
issue at arms relaxed their tense attitudes

  windy taylor jingled a spurred heel and
spoke out of the corner of his mouth to
the kids twin a bar s puncher

  it dont seem possible do it twin
the kids twin smiled and licked his
lips cat-fashion before replying-

  yuh can gamble stute thinks it do
  windy wagged his head

  tom is reckoned some swift on the
draw said he

  he was corrected the kids twin

  in the happy heart saloon henderson
sitting at the table farthest from the door
wrestled with his problem over a small
drink customers most of them looked
upon him with friendly eyes a few these
boon-companions of mr stute eyed him
askance he a stranger had shattered
their idol none however offered to take
up the dance-hall persons quarrel they
wondered what henderson was thinking
about he seemed so completely en-
grossed in his thoughts sat and stared
at his liquor without drinking it which
was unnatural

  maybe hes thinkin about what tomll
do to him hazarded ben skeel one of mr
simms dealers to his employer

  longhorn simms laughed sarcastically
and lit a long cigar

  yore a kid ben said mr simms
high pockets aint the kind to waste his
time

  djuh know him

  not me never seen him before in my
life but i got eyes an i know a real
shore-enough stingin lizard when i see
him them kind dont worry about no
future-not till she comes an i dunno


adventure

as they worry much then mr simms
added critically

  came noon and the habitues of the place
departed to eat henderson remained
where he was he had arrived at no
solution yet an hour later he raked up
an idea from the idea he evolved a plan
an amazingly simple plan he arose
leaving his untouched drink on the table
and went to the canton for dinner

  the few guests had finished and gone
when he entered a small fat chinaman
was taking up the used dishes and cutlery
sing luey sucked his pipe by the window
henderson sat down and gave his order
the fat chinaman went into the kitchen
sing luey padded across to hendersons
table henderson nodded sing luey
smiled till his eyes closed

  the night air observed sing luey
opening his eyes with a suddenness that
was startling is apt to be unhealthy in
farewell

  yeah

  unless one has eyes in the back of ones
head

  my idea exactly said mr henderson
solemnly me i got lots o eyes

  i am glad thus simply sing luey
and returned to his post at the window

  henderson ate his steak and potatoes
and found both excellently american the
coffee was above par it was ranch-cook
coffee and every one knows what that
means henderson was pleasantly sur-
prised he said as much to sing luey
when he paid the bill

  we strive to please beamed sing luey

  yuh done me a mans-size favor this
mornin said henderson i aint for-
gettin

  dont mention it deprecated sing
luey

  yuh must a been kind o watchin a
certain game almighty close henderson
drawled curiously

  the methods of the gentleman opposite
have never been to my liking sing luey
was not smiling now

  i see said henderson who didnt
quite ever see me before

  once or twice

  where

  seymour city

  know the cross t an slash f outfits
south of seymour

  i was cook at the cross t ranch-house

for three months a year and a half ago
then ive heard o yuh yuh shore
put cookin on the map in that ranch-house
yore name wasnt sing luey down there
names are inconvenient at times
smiled the celestial

  yeah drawled the other my names
bill henderson round here

  of course nodded sing luey

  i guess maybe we understand each
other

  surely

  mr henderson appeared to ponder a
moment

  so thats why yuh picked me out he
said suddenly

  yes replied sing luey i knew that
not a man in town would care to cross the
gentleman opposite but a stranger one
who did not know him might possibly run
the risk i have been watching you since
your arrival in farewell i saw you look
at the young lady it seemed to me that
you were promising

  tha-nks drawled henderson not in
the least put out by the chinamans frank
statement im shore obliged a lot an
im free to admit i like yore style

  he surveyed the celestial a moment
keen speculation in his gray eyes then
he made his decision he resolved to trust
sing luey why not he must trust
somebody and sing luey had made it
exceedingly manifest that he could be
trusted

  i guess yuh know the fellers in the town
pretty well huh questioned henderson
i have lived here eight months

  long enough theys three stores here
-calloways dolans an the blue pigeon
calloway dolan an the blue pigeon
feller-will they stand the acid

  ive heard that calloway agrees to
everything one says

  that leaves dolan an the other jigger
what about them

  they can not be walked over

  cant be rode huh thats good
bearin do they get drunk a lot go
hellin round-the like o that

  dolan is a man of regular habit-drunk
on mondays always cruel to his horses
too

  cross out mister dolan blue pigeons
the only card left to draw to any bad
wrinkles

  mister mike flynn the owner of the
high pockets



blue pigeon store is a man of his word
he is never known to drink his heart
is as big as himself to tell you the truth
had you failed this morning i should have
explained matters to mister flynn
although he is abominably slow on the
draw he prefers a shotgun

  i guess maybe mister flynn has his
points a shotgun aint to be sneezed at
can he keep his mouth shut

  like a chinaman

  henderson nodded and turned to go

  ill be seein yuh again he added over
his shoulder

no one was visible when hen-
derson entered the blue pigeon
store but a scrabbling noise behind
and underneath the counter betokened the
presence of the proprietor

  ill be topside one-time whoever yuh
are grunted a muffled voice me pipes
fell through a knot-hole an im sweepin

for the-thing

  no hurry said henderson and looked
about him

  neatness is not the rule in the average
store on the western frontier but the
blue pigeon was marvelously clean and
tidy a wide counter bordered two sides
and the back of the store proper behind
the counter tiers of packed shelves lined
the walls from floor to ceiling between
the counter and the shelves knotted ropes
at intervals of a yard depended from the
rafters above the canvas-curtained door-
way at the rear hung a beautifully-made
model of a black-hulled slim-sparred
clipper

  a gurgle of triumph from behind the
counter a thump and a scrape and the
proprietor bobbed into sight with the sud-
denness of a jack-in-the-box he was
fondling with stumpy broad fingers a short
and shiny clay

  id not have lost this for a lot declared
mike flynn not if i had to shift the
shack to get it an what can i do for
yuh

  he tucked the pipe tenderly into the
breast pocket of his blue flannel shirt and
rested both hamlike hands palms down on
the counter a wide heavy-shouldered
citizen was mike flynn with a red bullet-
head a chest like a barrel and thick
muscular arms his sleeves were stagged
off at the elbows long-tailed dragons and

geishas both beasts and ladies in four
colors were tattooed on those corded fore-
arms in the best japanese fashion an
open-mouthed tigers head gaped upon the
back of each hand

  kind o fancy aint they mike
flynn remarked with pride noting the
direction of hendersons glance cost
me four months pay in yokohama an
what is it yuh want

  my names henderson an i got a
proposition was the answer

if its mines i aint buyin a share
mike averred hastily cattle likewise
the keen blue eyes beneath the red-
thatched brows gazed suspiciously upon
mr henderson the latter laughed

  nothin like that henderson assured
the other this here proposition is to help
a lady

  huh doubtfully

  djuh see the lil lady that arrove in the
stage yestday

  shore

  she needs a job bad shes gotta have
one no two ways about that tom stute
offered her work

 the---- regarding

his opinion of the dance-hall proprietor
mike flynn left nothing to the imagination

  hes worsen that concurred hen-
derson he took back his offer later
mike flynns eyes grew bright with
interest

  i wasnt out in the street this mornin
said he but i heard somethin about stute

him

  i had a lil talk with stute henderson
admitted with becoming modesty

  shake cried mike flynn heartily and
clamped hands with henderson thered

sliding his right hand behind his back and
wiggling the fingers rapidly for all feeling

chapter iv

the rainbow

tox-trotting into town from the
south as henderson crossed the
street to laineys hotel came a rider on a
rangy red horse catching sight of hender-
son the rider uttered a shrill whoop and
spurred her mount henderson wheeled
in a flash the red horse hard held slid
to a halt at his side the rider a young
girl leaned from the saddle and held out a
gloveless hand

  an hows mister- she began
henderson whispered the man hur-
riedly and vigorously squeezed the proffered
fingers

  why of course laughed the girl
how stupid of me not to remember
howre tricks

  she clasped hands on her saddle-horn and
surveyed him a laughing devil in her black
eyes

  cornin in bunches he told her and
dropped his left eyelid

  naughty naughty she laughed and
winked back the pitcher will go to the
well once too many one of these days
not while i have my health

  and your assurance busy

  some

  meaning a lot -it ive been in

my uncles lazy river camp for a month
and i yearn for conversation other than
that of my relatives

  i tell yuh miss rainbow if i could whirl
the dictionary round my head like that id
be satisfied to talk to myself

  the rainbow threw him a charming
smile in payment and fished in her breast
pocket for the makings she was the half-
breed niece of that well-known and greatly
respected indian willies old brother-in-
law and she was a very handsome girl
her complexion was no darker than that of
the average brunette her figure would have
delighted a modiste and she had spent six
years in a convent the racial stoicism and
sullenness among other attributes were not
present in the rainbows make-up she
never acted like a true indian in her
language she was as unrestrained as in her
life it must not be supposed that she was
not a good girl she was good in all that
the adjective implies as more than one
philandering puncher had discovered to his
sorrowful surprise and bodily pain

  got a match she asked

  he pulled one from his hatband she
lit her cigaret and blew a luxurious ring
it speaks well for her beauty that she could
blow rings and look attractive without the
least difficulty he watched her admiringly

  tell yuh what he said struck by an
idea if yuh wanna talk real bad come
over to laineys with me theys a lil lady
there-a stranger an shes lonesome an
scared an needs cheerin up

  a girl exclaimed the rainbow ecstat-
ically my age

  just about

  scared you said of what the
rainbows brows drew together

  i dunno yuh neednt look at me so
cross i didnt scare her

  who did

  i dunno that neither she looked
scared when she come in the stage yestday
you go in an talk to her will yuh miss
rainbow

  will i just watch me wait till i
put windigo in the corral no dont
bother ill do it myself windyd bite
your little ears if you even tried to take off
his bridle wait for me in front

  horse and rider whirled and fled in a
scurry of pebbles and dust henderson
went to the hotel five minutes later
stammering in his speech red as to the face
he was presenting the rainbow to miss
blythe at the door of the latters room
shuh-shake hands with my friend the
high pockets



rainbow-miss-miss rainbow i mean
was the fashion of the introduction but it
sufficed and henderson retreated to the
outer air and the corral

  he leaned against the bars of the gate and
slatted his fingers across his damp forehead

  - he swore it aint no trouble

a-tall to talk to one girl by herself but two
together is shore a fright

  yuh look het up observed a calm voice
within a yard of his ear

  henderson turned and grinned into the
face of chuck morgan from soogan creek

  its a hot day explained henderson

  it aint the heats makin yuh sweat
chuck contradicted shrewdly what was
yuh mutterin about somebody glom
on to yore lil tin dishes or somethin

  howdja like nesterin countered
henderson

  nester yoreself cried mr morgan
with spirit screwing down the top of a
salve can and sliding the can into a pocket
of his chaps me i got forty cows four
bulls an twelve calves im gonna put the
bar s out o business myself an the  too
if i feel like it got a real shore-nough
brand to play with lil willie has yessir
any time yuh see a good-lookin cow cy
left hip staple fork each ear dont yuh go
fiddlin with it none cause its mine my
own

  all that drawled henderson and
glanced into the corral behind chuck to
where a raw-boned gray horse with a salve-
daubed cut on his shoulder was striving
vainly to reach his wound with his teeth
where djuh rustle the accordeen or did
yuh find him someers livin with the other
coyotes

  he and mr morgan were friends of long
standing and could insult each other with
impunity

  aint he a real hoss challenged chuck
dont look nothin like that yaller lump o
dust a-imitatin a three-legged table yonder
in the corner does he why dontcha buy
you a injun pony bill yuhd be sur-
prised honest yuh would

  speakin o bill chuck the other said
seriously id take it as a favor if youd
remember the last half o that name is
henderson

  chuck nodded

  i can see he announced solemnly
shes gonna be a wild night on the canal
mules pinnin back their ears an everythin

i hope i aint gonna miss nothin he
added anxiously

  remember yore a married man
chided henderson an yore place is the
home

  you talk like a hell-dodger cmon back
to soogan with me tonight you aint-

i am interrupted henderson
and continued in a lower tone
im one busy gent i dont mind

yore hat maybe yuh can help me listen
seven weeks ago sile thompson o the
slash f sent his brother rufe north to buy
horses off o scotty mackenzie up on the
dogsoldier rufe never reached the flyin
m he stopped in farewell heshereyet
chuck nodded with half-shut eyes

  they found him out back o the stage
corrals in the mornin he said slowly
hed been knifed an he was shore carved
piney jackson helped bury him an he
told me

  cut moren once was he

  ybetcha his throat was slit half-
through an his chest looked like it had
stopped a greeners buckshot but it was
all knife-work ceptin his face an that had
been tramped on yessir thompsons
features had been stomped to a frazzle
whoever done it shore carried a grudge
which is my idea-now sile thought
it was just a plain killin an robbery rufe
was carryin three thousand in bills

  in a belt

  in a belt

  i didnt hear nothin about no belt

found him jake rule an his deputy
kansas was the ones found him an they

bits his silver watch an sile thompsons

some drinks just a-pinin for you an me
chuck morgan immediately climbed
over the gate ten minutes later they
parted in front of the starlight saloon
chuck to execute his wifes commissions
henderson to return to his accustomed chair
flanking the doorway of the hotel

  from the window of miss blythes room
drifted a muffled murmur hendersons
eye-corners wrinkled with satisfaction

  the rainbow shore is good people he
pronounced to himself and promptly for-
got the lady in absorbing deliberation upon
his immediate business in life

  came chuck morgan within the hour
and sat down beside him on the door sill

  when are yuh leavin town queried
chuck

  leavin town henderson raised in-
quiring brows

  to save yore life

ing to be here long she asked

high pockets



  dont huh me you long-legged heron
you heard what i said the first time you
see her a lot and be nice to her or ill come
back and make you hard to find and-
and dont get drunk moren once a week
its bad for the liver let me see did i
forget anything she turned about and
regarded her saddlebags and the bulging
slicker tied behind the cantle candy and
jews-harps for the kids she rattled on
checking off the articles on her fingers and
tobacco and matches all in the slicker

  auntie little deers mirror needles
chewing-gum and butcher knife in the off
war-bag together with my two new shirts
and half the cartridges auntie two clouds
thread beeswax tin cup calico and my
tooth-brush and the other two bags o car-
tridges in the near the fish-hooks and
line in the staple-pocket and thats the
finish i do hope that mirror rides all right
if it doesnt and it busts its seven years
bad luck for me and auntiell have four-
teen fits so long mister henderson re-
member what ive told you hold still
windy you arent a pinwheel

  the rainbow hopped into the saddle and
rode off at a lope she did not look back
henderson went into the hotel and knocked
at miss blythes door a quick clicking of
high heels within the door opened and the
girl appeared she smiled at him there
was genuine cheer in that smile her dark
eyes had lost a deal of their initial sad-
ness

  about that job he began abruptly
i got it tendin store twenty dollars
a week

  twenty a week

  the dark eyes widened saucer-wise
shore twenty a week but if yuh dont
think thats enough ill betcha hed pay
more ill see him

  oh i didnt mean that she cried in-
stantly distressed i mean its a great
deal more than i expected i-im not

very experienced i-

  dontcha worry maam yuhll learn
-fast i know yuh will how about
cornin over to the blue pigeon-thats the
store-an havin a talk with mike flynn
hes the owner an a real gent

  id like to will i need a hat is it
far

  nothins far in farewell its only when
yore ridin the range places is far the
blue pigeons right close

  they walked across to the blue pigeon
it was their second walk together but on
that first occasion his mental processes had
moved too swiftly for him to be fully con-
scious of her slim slightness at any dis-
tance miss blythes almost perfect propor-
tions made her seem taller than she actu-
ally was but now with her beside him
he saw that she was barely two finger-
breadths taller than five feet she was
wearing high-heeled shoes too why she
could walk under his arm involuntarily
he hunched a shoulder and promptly felt
his face grow hot hastily he began to
comment upon the state of the weather

  the observant mr simms holding down
a cracker-box in front of dolans warehouse
permitted himself to smile he was think-
ing of his bet with mr stute

  i guess i win said longhorn simms to
himself and lit a fresh cigar on the strength
of it

  mike flynn was selling a customer when
henderson and the girl entered the cus-
tomer having paid for and received his
purchase would have lingered he had a
failing for brunettes but henderson
turned a cold eye in his direction and he
departed

  mike flynn did not wait to be intro-
duced

  so yore miss blythe he beamed ex-
tending a huge and freckled paw im
mike flynn an i hope yuhll like the blue

pigeon

  the girl put her hand in his and looked
squarely into his honest eyes

  i know i will said she

  an thats as it should be praise be
well get along fine could yuh be cornin
in behind the counter maam

  he lifted a hinged flap at the end of the
counter and beamed anew

  the girl turned to speak to henderson
but he had gone

  i didnt even thank him she exclaimed
what will he think of me

  whats thanks between friends said
mike but youll be seein him again
dont fret thim ropes wit the overhand
knots now theyre for me to lay aloft
but youll not be usin thim ill build
yuh a nate little step-ladder on wheels so i
will

  he seized one of the dangling ropes and
went up hand over hand till his head was
level with the top shelf here yuhll
adventure

take notice he continued holding him-
self in place with one hand and gesturing
with the other are the tarps an the chaps
stuff that goes slow an next-

from the blue pigeon henderson
went to the corral and caught up
his horse he wanted to ride and
think he realized that his present job
was an outlaw in every sense of the word
and that he was riding it bareback but
he was not in the least daunted he had
the happy theoiy that a murderer no mat-
ter how cleverly painstaking he may be
can not conceal all the evidence of his guilt
there is always a clue or two for the open
mind to perceive henderson had never
yet found cause to dispute this theory

  it was moon-rise when he returned to
town and long after the hotels regular
meal-hour he ate at the canton and
after supper he looked in at the starlight
saloon bought two long cigars and went on
to uie blue pigeon mike flynn was clos-
ing for the night but he bade henderson
enter and locked the doors and dropped the
heavy bar

  all alone i am an lonesome too said
mike i let the little lady go off watch at
six an told her she nadent work avenins
nor sundays nayther a bit o sunshine
she is the blessed child but im thinkin
its april sunshine theres sorrow at the
back o thim eyes a cigar thanks an i
will come aft for a mug-up an a gam
henderson did not know what a mug-up
and a gam might be but he followed mike
into the back room a room even more
scrupulously neat and clean than the store
from the ceiling a ships lamp hung in
gimbals against one wall was a solidly-
built bunk covered with a blue blanket
the other furnishings were sea-chests two
chairs a well-found cupboard and a kitchen
stove mike flynn thoughtfully drew the
ships curtains that ran on brass rods above
the windows and proceeded to make cof-
fee a mug-up it appeared when hender-
son expressed a polite curiosity was coffee
in a tin cup and a gam was a chat

 tis whaler-talk that last amplified
mike i was harpooner three voyages in
the gleaner out o new bedford the
sugars at yore elbow mister henderson
my friends call me bill

  mines mike grinned the irishman
heres luck

  this towns no place for a lady hen-
derson said at random over the coffee

  yore right but the poor innocent says
she likes it

  yeah shell change her mind when
some o these rousy jiggers get to hellin
round farewells got a rep

  aint it the truth a killin now an
then cant be helped but i aint got no use
for a murder not mike flynn

  seems to me i heard they was a party
rubbed out thataway about three months
ago

  i was thinkin o that but twas only
seven weeks rufe thompson his name
was from south o seymour someers as
fine-lookin a young man as yuhd ever hope
to see bought smokin an plug o me be-
fore hed been in town twenty minutes
by mornin he was shark-bait poor fellah
who killed him

  god knows an no one else they was
no evidence to be got though the sheriff
an his deputy wint sniffin hither an yon
for a wake

  maybe some stranger done it hen-
derson suggested

  he was the only stranger in town

  he might a had a argument with a
puncher

  it was not so rayported jake rule
traced ms movements kansas casey told
me an they was few an seldom after
lavin here with his tobaccy he put his hoss
in the hotel corral he wint to the star-
light an had one-two drinks he done
the same in the happy heart he ate
supper at the canton he wint back to
the happy heart an played black-jack an
the wheel maybe a couple o hours he
quit sixteen dollars loser an put in the rest
o the time till maybe one oclock in the
mornin in the dance-hall

  he told the barkeep over his last drink
at one oclock or thereabouts like im tellin
yuh he was goin to the hotel an turn in
he left the dewdrop but he didnt reach
the hotel for all jake could find out no-
body laid eyes on him after he left the dance-
hall till jake himself an kansas found him
stark dead wit his gun not pulled out back
o the stage corral in the mornin

  maybe he was drunk this rufe thomp-
son an-

  not him he only had two drinks at
the dance-hall an four maybe before sup-
per six drinks all told stretched through
high pockets



eight hours an they was short drinks-
none of em moren two fingers twould
make no man drunk such wouldnt
well on a rainy night like thatmost any-
thin could happen an not be found out

   twas not a rainy night twas a fine
night wit a full moon i mind that special
twas over the mast at midnight the moon
was for i wint to bed then an i seen it
s funny how with moonlight an all
he didnt see what was cornin an go after
his gun the grounds open back o them
corrals no place for a murderer to hide

  its all beyond me but its a-shame

i know that some more coffee bill

chapter vi

the way of the wicked

r henderson elected to leave
mike flynns quarters by the back
way he stood in the soft darkness of the
blue pigeons shadow his eyes on the
moon-drenched happy heart corral and
considered he had pumped mike flynn
fairly dry there was another he wished
to pump-the placid celestial sing luey
wished is used advisedly for the aver-
age chinaman can not be pumped and sing
luey was above the average he would
talk or not as the spirit moved him

  in the happy heart corral a horse neighed
shrilly from the house next door came
the rising wail of a wakeful baby a dog
at the other end of main street took excep-
tion to the moon and began to bark a
coyote in the distance yapped steadily a
voice at hendersons side said-

  good evening

  hendersons nerves were under excellent
control but he almost jumped he wheeled
and confronted sing luey

  why the gun questioned sing luey
in a tone of gentle reproof

  henderson returned the weapon to the
waistband of his trousers and smiled
crookedly his action had been natural-
for him

  dont be so - quiet next time

he whispered youghto know better
whadda yuh want

  what do you want was the quiet reply
me hendersons eyes searched the
serene features

  of course who else i knew you
would wish to see me again and i have been

sitting under kennedys wagon waiting for
you to come out i have waited two
hours

  henderson glanced at kennedys wagon
standing some thirty yards to the left

  howdja know id come out the back
way he demanded

  simple logic mike always bars and
locks his front door you and he were in
the back room naturally you would leave
by the back door

  you must a been keepin cases on me
mighty close henderson said crossly

  i knew you wished to see me it may
be that i wished to see you

  les go where we can talk abruptly

  my house is at your disposal suggested
sing luey suavely

  together the white man and the yellow
they catfooted through the shadows to the
rear of the canton henderson was more
than a thought uncomfortable hells bells
the chink was a mind-reader

  sing luey turned the wooden knob of the
cantons back door the door swung on its
hinges without a sound

  wait said sing luey i will make a
light

  henderson heard him padding about in-
side a match scratched and flared sing
luey lit a lamp and beckoned henderson
obeyed and closed the door behind him he
was in the kitchen of the canton in a
room at the right some one was snoring

  my cook sleeps with enjoyment ob-
served sing luey and led the way through
a narrow passage to a closed door he un-
locked this door thrust it open and en-
tered the room beyond henderson fol-
lowed sing luey set the lamp on a table
turned the key in the door-lock and
dropped a heavy piece of tapestry across
the door

  hendersons eyes ranged the room his
nostrils sniffed the incense-laden air the
bronze buddha on its jade stand the tiny
altar where joss-sticks glowed intrigued
him the gorgeous china silk hangings
concealing the walls and windows the
ancient leather-bound books that heaped
one-half the table filled him with wonder
he had never seen such things before

  and sing luey had once cooked for the
gross t he looked at sing luey the
chinaman smiled his balmy smile and indi-
cated the chair beside the table with a
swing of his hand


adventure

  be pleased to sit invited sing luey
i will lie upon the bed

  the chinaman waited with meticulous
politeness till his guest was seated then
dropped his long body sidewise upon the
narrow bed beyond the buddha and sup-
ported his head on one hand

  kong-fu-tse writes said he pro-
nouncing the eminent philosophers name
in the chinese fashion that nothing is
hidden what the eye does not perceive
the mind may fathom that is logic
henderson tilted his hat and rubbed an
ear

  i dunno yore friend- he began
haltingly

  he has been dead more than two thou-
sand years

  yeah well anyway he knowed what
he was talkin about some o them old-
timers was right wise i wonder now was
kung-kung-foo-soo-alive this minute
what hed say about a murder that hap-
pened here in farewell about seven weeks
ago

  he would take thought certainly ad-
mitted sing luey inscrutably

hed have to have somethin to go on
he would discover that something
there aint no evidence so far as i can
find out that anybody seen rufe thomp-
son-might as well be open with yuh i ex-
pect-from the time he left the dance-hall
till jake rule found him in the mornin
it was bright moonlight that night
observed sing luey

  henderson nodded he no longer felt
uncomfortable in the presence of sing luey
a warm liking for the chinaman grew apace

  it should have been an easy matter
went on sing luey to watch the move-
ments of mister thompson-had any one
taken the trouble

  no one did

  i did

  henderson received the declaration
coolly

  you would he remarked tell it
mister thompson ate supper here that
night d uring the meal he told piney jack-
son he was going to the flying m to buy
horses i heard him so did ten other men
mister thompson was an indiscreet young
man while he ate his left hand strayed
frequently to his side below the ribs
where does a man wear a money-belt

  i see henderson nodded grimly

  what you see i saw what i saw
other men saw it was too easy the
traveling north to buy horses the left hand
feeling for the safety of the unaccustomed
belt what more could a man ask

  yuh saw him leave the dance-hall
prompted henderson

  i did but that was pure chance i was
sitting on my door sill in the moonlight
when i saw a woman appear in the narrow
way between the stage station and carl-
sons stable the moon was almost di-
rectly overhead but the eaves of the stable
threw a shadow and the opening was in
darkness nevertheless i saw her white
face as she peered out past the corner of the
stable in the direction of the dance-hall
her manner was secret furtive and conse-
quently i observed her more closely than i
would otherwise have done

  a moment later mister thompson came
out of the dance-hall and started to walk
toward the hotel the woman drew back
deeper into the shadow i watched mis-
ter thompson would have to pass the nar-
row opening where the woman stood as
he passed he stopped she must have
called him but i could not hear he
turned aside into the opening and disap-
peared that is the last i saw of him

  if yuh could have warned him burst
out henderson

  primarily it was not my business
secondly how could i know what was to
occur thirdly can a chinaman warn a
white man thus sing luey without
rancor

  i jumped too sudden acknowledged
henderson yore right an im wrong
y aint said nothin to anybody else about
that woman have yuh

  hardly accidents especially accidents
to chinamen occur much too easily in this
country i prefer a quiet life

  henderson stretched out his long legs
and crossed one ankle over the other

  iiowdja know i wont say who told me
when i get through he asked

  i know mister henderson

yore takin a chance at that have
yuh got any idea who that woman was
not the slightest declared sing luey
there are fifteen women in farewell he
added helpfully

  how many married

  ten-with families each and every
one
high pockets



 that leaves five-five aint they five
 girls in the dance-hall

 exactly

 one o them huh

 i dont know

 yuh dunno but yuh can guess faster
 than a hoss can trot an so can i

 i am glad of that felicitated sing luey
 who was the ten men eatin here same
 time as rufe

  sandy bacon piney jackson ben
 skeel kansas casey dolan shorty vang
 lamp black torney eagle river pete
 and bill chase

 would yore pardner kung-foo-soo
 trail all o them jiggers

 knowing them as i do he would elim-
 inate four to begin with

 what four

 sandy bacon piney jackson kansas
 casey and dolan

 why them

 slow-thinking and honest all of them
 that leaves ben skeel lamp black
 shorty vang an torney eagle river pete
 an bill chase i know ben skeel shorty
 vang an torney are longhorn simms
 dealers an i amp blacks his look-out
 whadda the other two do for a livin
 eagle river pete is the stage-station
 hostler bill chase works for dolan
 any reason for suspect in the tinhorns
 none-except the nature of their call-
 ing

 how about eagle river an bill chase
 they are friendly with the other four
 henderson smiled sunnily

 i knowed i had a reglar job he ob-
 served but i got somethin to go on-
 now have any o them six gents yuh speak
 of left town lately

 not since the murder-that i know of
 guess yuhd know it if they had tell
 me somethin why yuh doin all this
 doing what asked sing luey
 readin sign for me thisaway

 sing lueys blank face became blanker
 he stared stonily at henderson

 i have answered a great many ques-
 tions he observed softly

 all right said henderson yuhve
 shore acted the part of a real gent an i

 dont give a - for yore reasons im

 obliged-again seems like ill be owin
 yuh a heap before im through

 you will owe me nothing when you are
 through

  the slanting eyes of sing luey glittered
opal-black in the lamplight or was it the
lamplight once on a street in san fran-
cisco henderson had been an unwilling
spectator of a fight between two tongs
the eyes of those chinese gunmen had
glittered in precisely the same way hen-
derson would have given a great deal to read
the mind of sing luey

  he stood up and pulled down the brim of
his hat

  guess ill be movin along he an-
nounced

st his walk to the hotel was not
uneventful as he was passing the

  -	starlight saloon a winchester in
the neighborhood of jacksons blacksmiths
shop cracked viciously and a bullet grazed
his left ear hendersons sidewise leap into
the grateful shelter of the starlights pile of
empty whisky-kegs would have done credit
to a bronco hot and wrathful for the ear
tingled he crouched behind his breastwork
swept off his hat and peered between two
slanting empties

  jacksons blacksmith shop in common
with every other building in farewell lay
silent under the moon of the enterpris-
ing bushwhacker there was no visible sign
henderson eased back on his heels laid his
useless six-shooter across his knee and ten-
derly fingered the smarting ear

  serves me-good an right he told

himself id oughta knowed bettern to
come friskin along so free an careless on a
moonlight night wonder is it stute i
aint really had time to gather many more
friends-yet

  he laughed silently his eyes on the black-
smith shop behind him the door of the
starlight opened suddenly henderson
looked over his shoulder the tousled and
sockless bartender stood in the door-
way

  whon-fired that shot demanded

the bartender it come right through the
door and busted-

  bang the flash of the gun winked at
the corner of the blacksmith shop and the
bullet scored a whisky-keg above hender-
sons head and splintered its way through a
window-frame henderson fired twice at
the flash

  the door had slammed shut as the glass
fell tinkling from within came the muffled
voice of the bartender


adventure

  say for gawds sake go someers else
will yuh he implored them bullets
come right through

  i like yore nerve cried henderson in-
dignantly you go hide under the bar if
yore scared

  im there now but i aint scared
its where i sleep-under the bar

  aw right go to sleep an be-

  how can i sleep with you chunkers
hellin round thisaway complained the
bartender if yuh gotta go pickin feuds
why dontcha pick em out on the
range

  i aint pickin no feuds denied hen-
derson im peaceable as all hell myself
hes doin the pickin guess he must a
thought you was me when he fired that last
time step out in the doorway once an
well fool him again

  you hold yore breath till i do snarled
the peevish bartender

  henderson grinned and tipped over an
empty instantly the enemy winchester
cracked and drilled the keg

  gettin nervous decided henderson
hell shoot at anythin that moves me
im goin away from here cant do nothin
with a six-gun at this range

  lying flat he wriggled backward along
the sidewalk to the corner of the saloon
he rolled round the corner scrambled to his
feet and ran as rapidly as his high heels
permitted to a point of vantage opposite
the blacksmith shop which point was a
straggly growth of bushes reaching out
tonguewise from the flank of the hotel
corral

  henderson lay on his stomach among the
bushes and scanned the place of ambush
with hopeful eyes but the prospect was
blatantly peaceful and apparently empty of
all life henderson remained where he was
for fully thirty minutes the wait was
barren of results

  roll in feller he told himself and
hitched his crawling way back to the
corral

  he circled the corral on his feet and
entered the hotel through a kitchen win-
dow

  anyhow that quick-shootin sport
didnt see me go into sing lueys or hed a
bushwhacked me when i come out was his
pleased judgment as he sat down on his cot
and pulled off his boots an thats one
good tiling ybetcha

chapter vii

deceitfully speaking

tut enderson was up at dawn he
- - never cockered himself in the matter
of sleep when business was to the fore he
couldnt afford to letting himself quietly
out of the hotel he angled across the street
to the blacksmith shop and narrowly in-
spected the place whence had come the law-
less bullets of the night

  in the light of day that side and corner of
the blacksmith shop wore an aspect of hon-
est trade several wagon wheels uttered
the ground a broken vise cuddled a billet
of wood a rusty log chain looped its links
across the vise certainly there were no
spent shells to be found though henderson
got down on his knees and pawed the dusty
earth about like any terrier

  sounded then steps upon the sidewalk
henderson did not desist from his labors
a man sauntered past the shop and halted
at sight of henderson the latter looked
up into the face of the marshal

  lost anythin queried the marshal
my diamond tarara was the reply de-
livered in a tone of the deepest concern i
wouldnt a lost it for two hosses an a new
wagon it must a fell off when i was
cornin home from the dance never did fit
like it should that tarara didnt yaint
seen it have yuh

  tarara repeated the mystified mar-
shal dance what dance they wasnt
no dance in town last night you mean
the dance-hall

  who fives next door henderson
changed the subject drawlingly

  nobody shes pineys shack where he
mows away wagon tongues reaches neck-

yokes an similar what-

  i was just wonderin thassall cut in
henderson i seen she was locked on the
outside o course but i always like to
know for shore it helps marshal it all
helps

  whatcha talkin about frowned the
marshal diamond tararas dances an
now it helps what helps what huh
thats what i wanta know

  seeins its you ill tell yuh im cornin
home to  the hotel in the mornin so early
when a gent right here where im squattin
now cuts down on me with a winchester an
misses puttin my light out by lessn a
inch yuhll notice my left ear is sort o
high pockets



burnt on top which aint all he done
neither the starlights shy some glass
the barkeeps lost k years growth an the
pile o empties out front is drilled a-plenty
such goins-on aint right a lil bit me i
want that night-raidin party arrested
yessir i want him in the calaboose where he
belongs

  i did hear some shootin last night
admitted the marshal but i thought it
was only some o the boys feelin good
an you was shot at

  aint i been tellin yuh want me to
put it in writin huh now you hop out
an arrest him like i say marshal

  who is he tell me who he is an ill
glom on to him fast enough

  howd i know who is he im askin
you yore the marshal youd oughta
know shes yore job fly at it when
you grab him lemme know an ill tell yuh
what to do next

  henderson stood up dusted his knees
grinned cheerfully at the marshal and
walked away

  the marshal with a flushed face watched
him go he was warmly aware that he had
been made game of but he did not feel
quite up to the task of resenting it-not
with henderson the latter was too utterly
careless of consequences it was a pleasant
world why seek to leave it thus in his
uncultured way reasoned the marshal and
went home to breakfast

  from the blacksmith shop henderson
went to the starlight saloon the red-
eyed bartender was yawningly mopping up
in preparation for the daily tide of
customers

  curryin the floor thisaway is one-

fool trick said the bartender without
raising his eyes at hendersons entrance
but the boss says shes gotta be did
- they aint no sense in bein so per-
nickety she only gets dirty again i-
oh its you is it he didnt get yuh did
he he added in a tone of disappointment

  dont be so-sorry adjured hen-
derson whered them bullets go
through the window

  i know that whered they hit

  on the wall yonder

  henderson strode to the indicated wall
he found the bullet-holes without diffi-
culty they were some ten feet apart and
bored at an angle he produced a clasp-
knife and dug into the wood

  hey dont do that remonstrated the
bartender yore spoilin the planks
which yore the most contrary gent i
ever see pronounced henderson not ceas-
ing to labor yore always wantin a fel-
ler to stop what hes doin shes a bad
habit yuhd oughta get over it i gotta
have these bullets i gotta theys no
two ways about it im makin a collec-
tion of all the lead cornin my way no mat-
ter where she hits why feller spose them
bullets had landed in you id have to be
diggin em out o yore carcass think o
that an shut up

  hendersons tone toward the end of his
speech became sinister the bartender
quieted and went sulkily on with his
work

  henderson scooped out the bullets with-
out difficulty and examined them closely
he dropped them into a pocket of his vest
and rang down a silver dollar on the bar

  theys a wheel for the damage he told
the bartender and marched out

  returning to the hotel he went in to
breakfast of the few guests all were pres-
ent save miss blythe henderson despite
a late start was the first to finish as he
left the dining-room he heard miss blythes
door open but he did not turn his head

  mr henderson anxious to disseminate a
little misleading information sauntered
down to the happy heart a modest one-
fingered drink in the heel of his hand he ad-
dressed the bartender

  dunno where i can pick up a few horses
an maybe some mules do yuh asked
henderson conscious that longhorn simms
was standing in the doorway of the back
room where he ran his games

  no i dont replied the bartender
some o the outfits round here might have
a few hosses to sell but mules is hard to
get when a gent has any he mostly
figures on keepin em 

  thats shore tough mourned hender-
son i was countin on a few mules i
guess now ill have to do some ridin
hows chances for cattle just a small

jag

  aimin to start a ranch the bartender
asked quickly

i might was the cautious reply an
then again i mightnt i might be buyin
em for somebody else yuh cant tell
he stared fixedly into the bartenders
eyes the mans gaze wavered dropped


adventure

he swabbed off the bar with sudden indus-
try henderson drank off his liquor and
departed

he stopped at the blue pigeon
and found miss blythe taking
stock she laid her list on the
counter weighted it with her pencil and
smiled upon him frankly

  i wanted to see you as soon as i could
she said but youd gone when i went to
breakfast i havent thanked you for-

for everything i am-

  now thassallright hastily interrupted
henderson yore lettin me do it is
thanks enough maam so dont you go
thinkin about it no more just forget it
 shant and i wont dont you sup-
pose i know why you were shot at last
night it was because you befriended me
youre running risks on my account

  she stopped her dark eyes shining her
lower lip caught between her teeth

  who told yuh i was shot at he de-
manded almost roughly

  no one i heard the marshal telling
mister flynn why the top of your ears
black with dried blood youve been
wounded and you never told me you
stay right here till i get some hot water and
bathe it and bandage it

  maam yuh musnt-i cant protested
henderson terrified lest a customer enter
and find him being tended my ears
fine only a scratch dont hurt a-tall
shes healin awready dontcha bother
i cant wait i got business maam
please

  it was the piteous entreaty that the girl
could not resist she paused with her hand
on the canvas curtain of the doorway lead-
ing to the rear room

  come back an sell me some neats-foot
he begged i wanna oil my saddle
youre sure its all right she said
earnestly returning slowly doesnt it
hurt a little

  not one lil lil he assured her

  but i dont like it you get hurt and
wont let me help you you might have
been killed

  i wasnt an i come mighty nigh
downin the other gent dontcha fret
next time ill rub him out shore

  miss blythe went white as the flour sacks
on the shelf behind her

  for heavens sake be careful she

cried if anything should happen to you
because of me id never forgive myself-
never

  somebodys cornin warned hender-
son better get me that neats-foot
piney jackson entering in quest of
matches found henderson sedately paying
a pale-cheeked girl for a can of neats-foot
oil henderson left at once with his oil
piney asking for matches was presented
with a plug of chewing

  i asked for matches maam said the
blacksmith

  i beg your pardon murmured miss
blythe im a little-i dont know the
stock very well yet

   tsall right maam theyre on the
left there second shelf

  henderson picked up his saddle and
bridle from where they lay under a window
in the hotel dining-room and carried them
out to the corral he dropped the saddle
across a convenient log straddled the log
and proceeded to oil the leather with care
and a soft rag

  he had finished the saddle and was start-
ing in on the bridle when longhorn simms
strolled round the corner of the hotel-and
advanced upon him mr simms inten-
tions were apparently pacific he was
smoking a long cigar his thumbs were
hooked in the armholes of his vest the
black eyes flanking the broken nose twinkled
amiably

  howdy was the gamblers greeting
tolrable tolrable said henderson re-
garding him gravely hows yore health
im able to eat replied longhorn
simms standing with legs spread wide
ive seen yuh in the happy heart my
names simms

  i heard it was said the noncommittal
henderson

  yeah persisted mr simms not in the
least dashed by the others manner i
hear yore in the market for hosses mules
an cattle

  yuh must a heard me talkin to the
bartender

  henderson rubbed his oily rag across the
crownpiece

  i did confessed mr simms an i
know where yuh can get some hosses
mules too

  thats good hearin where

  the  ranch

  the  ranch
high pockets



   yeah the manager has more hosses
  than he wants an six texas mules hes
  aimin to sell

    whend he tell yuh

    he didnt tell me i heard a couple o
  his boys talkin at the bar

    when henderson drawled the ques-
  tion his attention obviously centered on a
  stiff curbstrap

    oh last week sometime i disremem-
  ber exactly

    this was interesting mr simms had
  been in receipt of the news when he stood
  in the doorway of the happy hearts back
  room listening to henderson asking ques-
  tions of the bartender yet mr simms had
  kept back his information henderson
  wondered whether mr simms had had
  speech with mr stute in the interval
  henderson thoroughly oiled a check-piece

     if yore thinkin o ridin out to the 
   mr simms continued i guess ill trail
   along with yuh i got business there
   too

    i didnt say i had business there said
   henderson

   but them hosses an mules-you
  said-

    but maybe i wouldnt wanna go to the
   right now maybe now id rather try
  the cross-in-a-box or somethin

    whats the use  wastin time on them
  other ranches when i know the  has
  hosses an mules for sale

    yore shore advisin me for my own
  good admitted henderson yessir its
  right neighborly of yuh mister simms
  guess ill drift out there tomorrow

    ill go with yuh if yuh aint got no

  objections when-

    you didnt gimme time to say whether

-	i had objections complained hender-
  son

   have yuh mr simms managed a
  smile

  i aint not one lil objection yore
  as welcome as a cool breeze be here at
  four oclock in the mornin ill be waitin
  thats pretty early objected mr
  simms thinking of his nightly labors

   you dont have to come guess i
  could struggle along without yuh

   ill be here mr simms declared
  shortly so long

    henderson smiled happily at his saddle
  as mr simms walked away

    guess i must a riled him was his

thought some get riled most awful
easy an some-dont him an mes due
to have one real salubrious ride-not

he took from his vest pocket the
two pieces of lead he had dug from
the wall of the starlight he al-
ready knew that their caliber was - a
caliber common to many rifles in the
territory he shook the bullets dice-
fashion in the palm of his hand and swore
mildly

  if i was a real detective he reflected
these here lil babies would tell me a whole
lot yessir one look at em en id know
the kind of a gent who fired em the color
of his whiskers where he lives when hes
home an the names o his pa an ma i
wonder whatn-i dug em out for

  he flipped the bullets into the tongue of
brush beyond the corral and stooped to
retrieve his fallen rag but his eyes idly
followed the bullets in their flight and he
did not immediately straighten for he
marked a curious stir among the bushes at
the spot where the lead fell-a slight com-
motion that could not by any means be
directly attributed to the bullets

  henderson sat upright laid the rag tidily
across the top of the can and stretched
luxuriously then he arose and walked
slowly round to the opposite side of the
corral once past the corner he removed
his spurs and quickened his pace

  sixty seconds later walking softly on the
balls of his feet he was approaching the
tongue of bushes from the rear he
stopped at the edge craned his neck and
peered into the brush there on the far-
ther side like a jack-rabbit in its form a
man lay on his stomach by the turn of his
head he seemed to be watching the gate of
the corral and the log on which hendersons
saddle trailed its stirrups

  i aint there no more henderson ob-
served in a conventional tone

  the man humped himself at the hips and
scrambled to his frightened feet he faced
henderson trembling his mouth opening
and closing spasmodically his eyelids bat-
ting frantically he was the dance-hall
roustabout a poor creature men in their
humor had christened snakebite for he
was subject to epilepsy

  who set you here to watch me hen-
derson asked gently

  snakebite shook in his not-too-clean


adventure

 clothing till he resembled a scarecrow in a
 gale and gobbled unintelligibly

 who did persisted henderson

 hell kuk-kill me the wretched snake-
 bite wailed mournfully

 yuh neednt squeal said henderson
 geddown quick before somebody sees yuh

 snakebite dropped instantly hender-
 son squatted on his heels

 tom stute told yuh to come here an
 watch me didnt he henderson pur-
 sued inexorably

 snakebite stared with terror-stricken
 bleary eyes

 didnt he persisted the former

 snakebite nodded forlornly

 i thought so

 hell kuk-kill me repeated the un-
 happy pilgarlic his mind refusing to be di-
 verted from that cardinal issue

 i expect-if he knows it observed
 henderson grimly but he neednt know
 it unless you tell him i wont tell him
 ybetcha

 the blear-eyes grew less wobegone

 see went on henderson i aint
 tellin nothin an dont you heres a
 dollar

 snakebites talons clutched the piece of
 silver he pouched it swiftly in the one
 good pocket of his tattered trousers dol-
 lars were few and far between with the
 dewdrop roustabout

 whatd he tell yuh to do asked
 henderson

 he told me to watch when yuh got yore
 hoss an see which way yuh went said
 snake-bite becoming calmer with every
 breath he drew

 goin to watch all day

 all night if i had to he said

 he shore works his help that feller
 heres the makins an matches snake-
 bite just you lay an smoke an watch
 like a good jigger an when yuh go back yuh
 can tell yore boss i aint caught up my hoss
 none an remember hell shore hang yore
 hide on the fence if he finds out i caught
 yuh here

 ill remember snakebite nodded
 gratefully

 whered them bullets hit yuh asked
 henderson

 what-what bull-oh them was them
 bullets i thought they was rocks hit

 me on top of the head so they did -

 hard i near jumped up

  i guess that must a been whyfor i dug
em out henderson grinned

  dug em out

  nothin youd understand snakebite
so long

  henderson raised a cautious head and
seeing no one stood up and unhurriedly
retraced his steps to the saddle and the oil

  he aint leavin nothin to chance that
stute gent he said to himself as he sat
down on the log and picked up his bridle
i wonder now does he think im aimin to
give that tinhorn simms the slip im
shore wonderin a whole lot

chapter viii

the dewdrop

hought youd gone home hen-
derson gazed at chuck morgan in
mild surprise

ily but i forgot somethin i come back

fracas over south o injun ridge even if

  chucks allusion concerned an incident
of the trail wherein morgan beset by several
gentlemen bent upon his assassination had
been rescued by henderson

  aw -henderson said helplessly

and let it go at that

  what do we do now queried the ener-
getic mr morgan

  nothin-now tonight i sort o figured
on lookin in at the dance-hall
high pockets



  now yore whistlin a tune maybe
tom stutes handll be all right again
maybe hell want action him an his friends
an you was a-goin to swing an rattle with
that crowd on yore high lonesome well

all i gotta say-

  dont say it lets go over to the
blacksmith shop an pitch hoss-shoes
two-bits a game cmon

  by five oclock chuck was seven games
ahead piney jackson having successfully
set a stubborn tire called it a day and
wanted in

  hop to it said henderson take my
place i gotta go buy me the makins
an i shore hope yuh beat this wall-eyed
pirate hes all swelled up like a poisoned
pup right now with a dollar six-bits  my
money in his pants pocket take it away
from him

  henderson hitched up his trousers and
walked along the street to the blue pigeon
he found mrs rule and mrs jackson
buying groceries the former lady was
bewailing the fact that the store was out
of her pet brands of canned corn and baking-
powder

  an i was aimin to have succotash an
biscuits tonight for jake grumbled mrs
rule i want him to send east for a
melojum an hell do anythin for me when
hes full of succotash an biscuits

  aint it the truth chimed in mrs
jackson give a man what he wants to
eat an hell say yes to anythin not but
what piney aint a easy man to do for an a
good provider she added hastily unwilling
that her hearers should for one moment
doubt that her husband possessed all mortal
virtues but grub shore does count an
thats a fact you wait till yore married
honey an youll see

  this last was to miss blythes address
she promptly blushed red as any artillery
guidon

  ill-ill never get married she stam-
mered

  dont think it said mrs rule you
wont have no trouble not with them eyes
an hair but dont you be in no hurry
take yore time an look round a-plenty
thevs lots o men in this world but theys
only one husband be sure hes steady an

saves his money an-

  henderson withdrew to the street and
kicked restless heels against an empty box
till mrs rule and mrs jackson arm-laden

and chattering endlessly departed home-
ward

  at hendersons entry miss blythe looked
up from the ledger in which she was adding
a column of figures and smiled her winsome
smile at him her cheeks were still be-
comingly flushed

  how yuh gettin along he asked his
grin answering the smile

  mister flynn says im learning very
quickly i like it here lots mister flynn
is awfully kind and patient with me how
is your ear

  she eyed with concern the organ in ques-
tion

  fine he would be hes one white
gent he is i was just wonderin maam
if-if yuhd like-if some sunday now-if
i get yuh a gentle cayuse-can yuh ride
maam

  why yes i can ride replied she

  then thats all right will yuh go
ridin with me some sunday the words
at last came out with a rush

  he stood at gaze perspiring slightly

  id just love to go was the heartening
answer

  ill fix it up soons i can he told her

  jingle rattle thud and clink in dusty
main street the stage from the south
was rolling in at the sound the girls face
blanched the pupils of the dark eyes
dilated she caught her breath sharply

  i wonder where i left my handkerchief
she said in a low tone and walked to the
front of the store and made a show of
searching the shelves near the window

  henderson did not fail to perceive that
while her hands poked about among cans of
tomatoes and peas her eyes strayed ever
toward the street and the halted stage

  henderson slid backward till he too could
look out of the window at the stage one
by one the passengers alighted they were
five in number-four obvious punchers and
a salesman lugging his sample-case the
girl came back her fingers drumming on the
counter the noiseless mr henderson
had apparently not moved from his place
near the ledger

  i guess i must have lost it she said
carelessly

  its stickin out over yore belt hen-
derson informed her

   so it is

  she pulled out the handkerchief and
tucked it in place again


adventure

  guess ill take a couple o sacks o
tobacco an some papers said henderson

  he went away with his purchase fingers
rolling a preoccupied cigaret

  when the stage come in she got scared
he reflected when she come back from
the window after seein who got off she
wasnt she thinks somebodys a-trailin
her thats a cinch when he she or it
drifts in i shore gotta be in farewell free
an adjacent ybetcha

in the cool of the evening mr
henderson and mr morgan visited
the dance-hall under the flaring
lamps to the tucker and lilt of soldiers
joy a sweating cowboy was dancing a jig
and dancing it well the dewdrops deni-
zens and the customers lined wall and bar
and cheered the puncher on mr stute
and mr bill chase the former with his
right arm in an ostentatious sling stood
beside the fiddlers table the entrance of
mr henderson and his friend passed un-
noticed for a space

  when the bartender became mindful of
his duties mr henderson was leaning
against the end of the bar near the door and
mr morgan stood across the room his at-
tention obviously centered on the hard-
working dancer

  the bartender approached mr hender-
son and looked at him with unfriendly eyes

  whisky mr henderson said briefly

  the bartender filled the order collected
and withdrew to the far end of the bar
he caught the eye of his employer grinned
one-sidedly and jerked his head backward
mr stute glanced along the bar and moved
closer to mr chase in order to obtain a
better view mr chase looked up saw
henderson and instantly assumed the un-
conscious expression of a wooden indian
not so mr stute he reddened with an-
ger and walked with stiff quick strides to
mr henderson and as he walked the
fiddling ceased the cowboy stopped in the
middle of a step and men and women
nudging one another turned their eyes upon
that tall lean citizen standing at the end of
the bar

  my arm has not yet entirely recovered
stated mr stute facing henderson at the
distance of a yard

  thats shore tough commiserated mr
henderson but i aint yore doctor

  mr stute was pleased to ignore the

flippancy he glared into the eyes of mr
henderson but the latter had stared into
the eyes of grimmer harder men than mr
stute the washed-out gray gaze held
steady the spirit behind the black eyes
struggled all it knew but it did not know
enough mr stutes eyes flickered
dropped and fastened themselves on mr
hendersons top shirt-button

  when my hands well mr stute began
thickly

   youll be able to go ridin supplied mr
henderson

   i warn you ill shoot on sight

  thanks for the warnin i didnt need
it all i gotta do is watch yore hand to
play safe yore so-slow with a gun

   this to mr stute who had till the com-
ing of this stranger prided himself on his
ability to draw never a person of equable
temper mr stute now lost his head he
shifted his feet and struck left-handed at
his tormentors face a blue flash arced
in the lamplight steel struck bone with a
cracking snap and mr stute thumped
down on his knees at hendersons feet
mr stutes features were convulsed with
pain he grunted like a pig it may be said
that he suffered

  henderson took a step backward the
long gun with whose barrel he had broken
mr stutes wrist swinging at his knee

  yuh hadnt oughta make a break like
that he observed dispassionately ad-
dressing mr stute but watching with
alert care the spectators once again the
hand is quicker than the eye

  a great silence marred solely by the
porcine plaints of mr stute was upon the
roomful the women after their kind
looked at mr stute the men at henderson
no one moved

  the bartender was the first to recover
himself his hands which had been rest-
ing on the bar slid slowly inward his
body became rigid

   i spose theys a six-shooter behind the
bar drawled henderson hop to it
feller

  the bartenders hands froze to the wood
the red-haired girl with two round red
dapplings of rouge on cheeks from which all
the blood had receded shook her half-
naked shoulders and stumbled forward to
the side of mr stute and slipped a hand
beneath his quivering armpit

  get a hold o yoreself tom she
high pockets



shrilled gimme a lift here some o yuh
we gotta get him to bed

  it was borne in upon henderson that he
had outstayed his welcome he and chuck
morgan oozed warily crabwise through the
doorway into the street

  yuh shore have put tom in the discard
for a spell chuckled morgan when their
legs were straddling the log near laineys
corral gate

  i expect mourned henderson -

his soul whatd he have to come squinchin
round for i wanted to look over them
women

  huh the surprise in morgans tone
was patent

  rufe met one of em after he left the
dance-hall that night explained hender-
son

  yuh never told me that

  i was goin to anyway yuh know now
  howdja find it out

  a lil bluebird with pink whiskers told
me

   shes gotta be true then pink whiskers
never lie which one of them floozies was
it

   thats what i gotta find out

  djuh think the woman downed him

  i dunno what to think yet dodged
henderson i was aimin to sort o get
acquainted with them females

  it dont seem like a woman would
carve a feller the way rufe thompson was
carved morgan said soberly

  yuh cant tell yuh cant tell nothin
about it gotta wait thats all tomorrow
me an longhorn simms are rid in out to the
 to buy bosses an mules maybe ill
know somethin by the time i get back
maybe yuh wont get back

hind leg but i like to gamble always have
dontcha fret me an mister simms will
scatter along all same sunday-school schol-
ars on a picnic

  shell be one helluva picnic averred
the doubting mr morgan and let the
subject drop

   it is not in the range code to insist that a
friend is not utterly capable of taking care
of himself

chapter ix

the artful dodger

at precisely four oclock in the
morning henderson led his yellow
horse through the gateway of laineys cor-
ral it was daylight the sun was just
rising over the eastern hills the windows
of the hotel shone redly in the flat rays
henderson swung up and rode out into main
street

  longhorn simms his mount a staring
white pony with black legs loped out from
behind the blacksmith shop a flicker of
bright interest gleamed in hendersons
gray eyes at sight of the white pony

mornin was the gamblers greeting

  howdy returned henderson wed
oughta make it before grub-time to-
night

  shore ought-if we keep a-movin
concurred the gambler and fell in at
hendersons side

  their fifty - yard shadows streaking
splotchily the ground on the right they
single-footed out upon the trail to the south
as they rode they discussed amicably the
meager news of cowland-reports of rustling
beyond the hogpen range the lynching of a
horse-thief by the impulsive citizens of
marysville the backsliding of tommy mull
cutters hotelkeeper

  which that tommy mull shore cele-
brated when he jumped the fence said
longhorn simms an he wants every-
body in on it too he goes the limit that
jigger does an cutter shore has a savage
time why the station boss an his helper
is so drunk whisky jim has to catch up his
teams his own self

  anybody killed

   naw course two or three has to quarrel
but pie-eyed gents most genally miss an
they was an they did

  thas good the territory aint got so
many folks she can afford to go shy any
inhabitants unless theys a reason i hear
they was a feller rubbed out here a couple
o months ago


adventure

  lessn that-six or seven weeks rufe
thompson his name was

  some old silver-tip huh

  young jigger under thirty

  yeah i didnt know he was young as
that sliced all up they said

  shore was

an they never found out who done it
not yet when they do hell be lynched
whoever he is she was shore one cowardly
killin both mr simms manner and
tone were righteously indignant

  i hear the dead gent didnt have a
chance

  course not his gun wasnt even
pulled

  whadda you guess thus casually
mr henderson

  some gent had a grudge against him
thats a cinch the gambler declared with
conviction else why would he carve him
all up thataway some gent with a grudge
i say jake oughta do somethin

  they say theys no evidence

  they must be some find the gent
with a grudge hes the one done it
the grudge theory seemed an obsession with
mr simms

  i guess maybe yore right said mr
henderson and rolled a meticulous cigaret

  it was to be observed that while building
the slim roll his hands were held low be-
tween his middle and the saddle-horn a
hand in this position is enabled to go after a
six-shooter concealed under a vest without
loss of time	 v

  the cigaret completed between his lips
and lighted hendersons right hand fell
away to his side the fingers brushing the
butt of the gun tied down on his right leg
mr simms rode on that side henderson
had carefully maneuvered him into that
position at the start

  he was leaving nothing to chance al-
though he did not believe that mr simms
would become personally and actively
hostile he believed that a radically dif-
ferent plan of action skulked behind the
black eyes of mr simms

  in perfect conversational accord the two
men topped indian ridge and rode down
the reverse slope at the foot of the ridge
the trail ducks in and out of a shallow draw
which draw runs west and east hender-
son elected to turn westward along the
draw mr simms voiced instant and vig-
orous objection

  why not henderson wished to know
why for countered the gambler
heres the trail were a-ridin it now
whatsa use o squanderin all over the
range thisaway hard goin over west
too theys some hills well have to go
round well lose time

  i heard this was a short-cut wavered
 henderson

  yuh heard wrong shes ten miles long-
 er easy

  shore

  shore as yore a foot high

  then les go by the draw im feelin
 just like one long ride

  the smile of mr henderson was disarm-
 ing in its innocence

  i tell yuh- began mr simms

  dont tell her too hard suggested
henderson  yuh might waste yore breath
-or somethin

  the gambler strove to read hendersons
 eyes but they told him nothing

  aw right he said ungraciously well
 go yore way an im tellin yuh yuh wish
 yuh hadnt

  ill remember henderson told him
cordially if yore wrong i wont hold it
against yuh

  youll see grumbled the gambler
 familiar discourse ceased for several
 hours not till noon became afternoon
 did mr simms break the silence

  yuh seem to know this country -

well observed mr simms

  ive been askin questions said hen-
 derson wheres that hard sleddin you
 was talkin about

  well shes miles longer anyway mr
 simms defended lamely

 yeah well see go yuh ten we
reach the  before supper

  i aint bettin  grunted the gambler
 i dunno as i wanta go no further guess
 maybe ill be leavin yuh

  i wouldnt do that drawled hender-
son the palm of his hand resting as if by
chance on the butt of his gun i like yore
company mister simms yore amusin
yore amusin as all hell

  a man of hastier nerves would have im-
 mediately resented hendersons innuendo
 but mr simms manifested perfect control
 over his nervous system and proved him-
 self a highly dangerous citizen by smiling
 amiably

  im glad yuh think so said he in
high pockets

i

 my business i cant afford to make folks
 laugh

  yuh shore make me laugh grinned
henderson

  but the gambler merely smiled gain

they rode silently onward through
the hot bright afternoon the ten-
sion between them growing with
every step of their horses feet relative
to shooting the gambler henderson felt
no compunction it was shoot or be shot
and simms had the call henderson se-
cure in the belief that he himself had the
edge waited serenely no amount of ten-
sion could affect his nerves

  so the minutes passed without incident
till tom dowling of the  galloped out of a
draw and swung in their direction

  well ill bedam if it aint bill hender-
son bawled tom dowling when he was
close upon them iiare yuh bill
howdy simms

  tom crowded his horse alongside and
heartily shook hendersons hand

  this is shore luck declared tom
runnm up on you two gents thisaway i
guessed id have to ride in alone cornin
to hunt you a job bill were a man
short

  no i aint tom me an mister simms
is just ridin out on business is lanpher
still manager

  shore he is but most o the outfits
new since you was here

  i was right the first time cut in mr
simms addressing henderson yuh do
know this country pretty well

  i oughta henderson averred com-
placently yuh see i used to work for
the 

  yuh didnt tell me that fretted mr
simms

  guess i forgot my memory gives me
a heap  trouble sometimes

  i expect

  tom dowling began to sense that all was
not smooth between these two he won-
dered why henderson turned his head
slightly and winked at him thus completing
the punchers mystification

  henderson was now smoking a much
needed cigaret he could afford to quite
safely mr simms would not dare make
conspicuously uncalled-for war in the pres-
ence of tom dowling henderson almost
laughed

  so in the late afternoon they came to the
squat buildings and broad corrals of the 
ranch from the open doorway of the
ranch-house kitchen drifted the clatter of a

snarling voice laying down the law

  an i tell yuh cookie nagged the
voice that coffee tasted like dishwater
you make a good potful tonight an see
shes good an dont fry the steak to
leather like yuh done the last time think
my teeth is steel or somethin well

neither

  lanpher must be home observed
henderson

  sounds that way chuckled tom dow-
ling he lays out cookie reglar once a
week says it keeps him from gettin
uppity f i was cookie id shore crawl his
hump a few but cookie dont giveadam
he just laughs

  a slim little rat of a man with a narrow
frowning face appeared in the kitchen door-
way and surveyed the three horsemen

  howdy bill said the little man walk-
ing toward them iiare yuh longhorn
i spose now yuh want a job bill huh
not me lanpher replied henderson
backing and turning his horse till he faced
both simms and the  manager i come
here to buy hosses an mules longhorn
simms says yuh got both to sell

  well i aint not by a jugful denied
lanpher i need all my ponies an i
wouldnt sell my four mules at no price

take simms drawled henderson

regarding henderson

no mistake when yuh cinched yore saddle on
that white cayusc so yore bushwhackin
friends hidin along the trail someers would
know we was coinin a long way off an have
time to get ready a-plenty

  whatcha talkin about asked mr
simms his sinister features depicting in-
tense amazement

  i aint through talkin yet pursued
henderson as the prudent lanpher skipped
nimbly in one direction and tom dowling
jumped his horse in another id just like
to know why tom stutes friends gotta horn
in on his quarrel why cant they let tom
settle it when he gets ready stead o smooch-
in round tryin to wipe me out thisaway


adventure

  yore crazy cried mr simms

  dontcha spose i know it was you cut
down on me from behind jacksons black-
smith shop that night snapped hender-
son at a venture

  mr simms ceased to dissemble his
right hand flicked to his vest-pocket and it
flicked with speed but hendersons agile
fingers were a split-second speedier mr
simms a neat hole in his right shoulder
swayed clutched at the saddle-horn missed
his grip and pitched backward to the
ground

  as has been said mr simms was a hard
citizen there was still a deal of fight in
mr simms he writhed sidewise and
went after his other derringer left-handed
henderson accurately drove a bullet
through his left elbow mr simms went
flat his nose in the dirt and mumbled
curses through set teeth

  yall seen it said henderson cold gray
eyes sweeping lanpher tom dowling and
the open-mouthed cook in one compre-
hensive glance he went after his gun
first

  shore he did lanpher made haste to
assure him

  it was an even break ybetcha pro-
nounced tom dowling

  the cook said nothing he was too
filled with awe to utter a word it was the
first time he had ever seen a man shot

chapter x
the new arrival

vou come back alone yestday the

  	boys wanna know where longhorn
simms is at it was the marshal of
farewell speaking

  he loomed above henderson where the
latter sat in his tip-tilted chair in front of
the hotel

  what boys drawled henderson look-
ing at the marshal with sleepy eyes

  longhorns friends an-

  hes got friends huh i didnt know
that

  henderson shook the ash from his
cigaret with a flirt of his wrist and grinned
at the marshal

  dont get gay warned the marshal
tell-

  i aint gettin gay denied henderson
im solemn as a graveyard what i cant

see is why them friends o longhorns dont
come to me personal what they got to
send you for	

  they didnt send me i come myself
an jake rule an kansas casey are cornin
in a minute

  then ill wait till they come no use
o tellin the same thing twice is they
marshal

  the officer made no reply he stepped
heavily to the chair temporarily vacated
by bill lainey and sat down henderson
turned a lazy head and looked northward
along main street the sheriffs com-
bination house and office was the outermost
building at the north end of town a group
of men were standing in front of the sheriffs
house while henderson sat at gaze the
official front door opened the sheriff and
kansas casey issued and joined the waiting
group by twos and threes jake rule
and his deputy in the lead the little crowd
moved briskly southward

  ben skeel shorty vang torney an
lamp black henderson said to himself
his eyes following the progress of the
sheriff and his train eagle river pete
an bill chase all they need is tom
stute to make her complete

  he flipped his cigaret-butt into the air
and hooked his long thumbs in his belt

  looks like visitors observed chuck
morgan suddenly appearing in the hotel
doorway

  dont it said henderson

  chuck morgan leaned hipshot against
the door jamb his eyes shone with
pleasurable anticipation

  opposite the happy heart the sheriff
and his followers changed direction and
headed diagonally across the street toward
the hotel mike flynn sitting on the
doorsill of his shop stood up as the crowd
passed him and stumped hurriedly in-
doors

  the sheriff and his following halted at
the edge of the sidewalk in front of hen-
derson jake rule and his deputy were
in front the others remained modestly
in the rear there was no crowding

  wheres longhorn simms the sheriff
asked without preliminary

  at the  ranch replied henderson
  whats he stayin there for

   cause he cant ride

  why cant he ride

   cause i had to plug him
high pockets



  whatd i tell yuh cried foxy-faced
ben skeel

  whatja plug him for the sheriff kept
squarely to the main issue

  whadda yuh genally plug a jigger for
drawled henderson  cause yuh like him
or somethin

  whadja plug him for jake rule
persisted patiently

  we had a argument an longhorn went
after his gun first

  thats a- began shorty vang and
cleared his throat raucously instead of
completing the sentence

  shorty seems to have a cold observed
henderson what was yuh gonna say
shorty les hear it

  shorty looking anywhere save at hen-
derson glimpsed mike flynn sidewheeling
across the street in the hollow of mikes
arm rested a sawed-off greener mike sat
down on a fortuitous whisky keg in front
of the next house and nursed the shotgun
across his knees there was a slight stir
among the friends and employees of mr
simms the sheriff glanced over his
shoulder

whatcha doin mike he demanded
clanin me greener replied the irish-
man jerking a blue bandanna from a hip-
pocket and proceeding to vigorously polish
his armament

  jake rules wide mouth twitched at the
corners he said no more to mike flynn
but turned again to henderson

  yuh say simms went after his gun first
remarked the sheriff

  yep

  all right i aint doubtin yore word
but im gonna send my deputy over to the
 an see what they say i spose now
they was witnesses

  shore was lanpher tom dowlin an
the cook they all seen it

  thatll be good-for you while were
waitin for my deputy to come back-
kansas you better start right now-while
were waitin youll have to give up yore
gun an roost in the calaboose

  not me henderson declared cheer-
fully i dont hand over no gun an
i dont stick in no calaboose none what-
ever i aint got nothin against you
sheriff personal but if you go to throw
down on me this deal will finish in the
smoke

  what he says goes double for me

jake chuck morgan announced quietly

  the hammers of mike flynns shotgun
clicked suggestively to full cock

  jake rule hesitated he was a brave
man he had gone against the iron many
times but there are moments when to
walk softly is the course of wisdom he
knew nothing of henderson but he did
know that mike flynn and chuck morgan
of the c y were numbered among the fore-
most citizens of the county behind chuck
morgan was the might and influence of the
great bar s ranch jack richie the cross-
in-a-box manager and his hard-riding
outfit were chucks warm and partisan
friends- election day would arrive in
november and the sheriff had his heart
set on a third term the contest would be
close the sheriff was in a quandary
politics is indeed a dreadful thing

  tell yuh what jake said chuck
morgan suddenly yuh know me take
my word he wont skip till yore good an
satisfied the shootin was on the level

  take mine too cut in mike flynn
if mister henderson dont stay here in
town ill give yuh my store

at this juncture miss blythe
came out of the blue pigeon and
ran across the street to the knot
of men in front of the hotel she hopped
up on the sidewalk and faced the sheriff
henderson stood up and took a step
toward her

  what do you want with him she
demanded hysterically her small fists
doubled so tightly that the knuckles
showed white your wife just told me
you were going to put him in jail for shoot-
ing a man if he did the man deserved it
you shant put him in jail i tell you
you shant

  miss blythe pink-cheeked stamped her
foot at the sheriff the latter backed away
and flapped futile hands at the excited
young lady

  now maam he began helplessly

now maam-

  go away maam please begged the
scandalized henderson laying a hand on
her ann

i wont she snapped without looking
at him and jerked her arm free i wont
till i know what that man intends to do
she glared upon that man the
wretched sheriff gulped it was his custom
       r

	adventure

to tell his wife everything he cursed the
custom now

  lookit here sheriff henderson said
spose i come down to yore office an stay
round you till kansas gets back hows
that

  fine the sheriff agreed thankfully
chuck better come too

  there see everythins all right hen-
derson told miss blythe

  miss blythe squeezed the palms of her
hands against her hot cheeks she dropped
her arms and turned away

  it had better be she said wearily and
walked with drooping shoulders back to the
blue pigeon

  any time yore ready henderson
hinted jake rule

  henderson chuck morgan the sheriff
and a commandeered friend of the latter
spurred the flitting hours with the national
game of draw it was an expensive session
for the sheriff and his friend

  i hope kansas hurries back the sheriff
remarked at half-past ten that night

  i dont grinned henderson en-
trenched behind five tall columns of chips
one card sheriff

  ill take two said chuck morgan
i aint particlar if kansas has to walk
im plenty strong now but i aim to get
stronger runnin a ranch is expensive
sos cards grieved the sheriffs friend
eying his lonely stack of whites

  late in the afternoon of the following
day kansas casey dismounted in front of
the sheriffs house

  aw-he groaned when he pushed

open the door and perceived the card-
players hunched in tense absorption over

their four-square game aw -he

repeated ive missed somethin

  you aint denied the sheriff yore
lucky to been away chuck an hen-
derson have won about everythin but the
jail give em- another ten minutes an
theyd had that

  aint we gonna play no more hen-
derson cried in alarm

  we aint the sheriff declared what
did lanpher say kansas

  just what he said kansas told him in-
dicating henderson with a jerk of his head

  then yore plenty free to drag it
henderson said the sheriff

  thanks henderson said dryly i
take it yuh want to cash in sheriff

  you bet about that gray pony an
saddle you won henderson-theys the
saddle an bridle in the corner an the
cay use is out in the corral id like to buy
that hoss back next month hes the only
plumb gentle pony in my string dont
pitch kick bite nor nothin pie aint
no go-devil of a mans hoss an i dunno
as hed suit yuh anyway

  hell suit this man grinned henderson
i like a quiet life once in a while i heard
he was gentle as a kitten thats why i
got yuh to bet him so yuh see sheriff
just how it is

  hendersons tone was politely regretful
the sheriff figuratively said good-by to his
pet pony

  ten minutes later henderson his pockets
heavy with part of his winnings was leading
the saddled remainder to the hotel corral

  whadda you want this kind o hoss
for queried the inquisitive chuck bliss-
fully patting his own bulging pockets

  wanna see if hes gentle like i heard
was the unilluminating reply

  in the furtherance of this desire hen-
derson presently strapped a blanket round
his waist boarded his new acquisition and
loped his three times round the corral
turned him on a dime and trotted him
the other way then he thumbed him
an operation which invariably elicits a buck
if one is available but the pony merely
pointed inquiring ears and attended to his
knitting with admirable calm henderson
pulled up in triumph in front of chuck
slipped to the ground and unstrapped the
leg-enshrouding blanket

  mostly a blanket floppin round their
hocks bothers even the gentlest observed
henderson stripping off saddle and bridle
but not this ul gray feller he dont
mind nothin

  i dunno but what ill buy him for the
wifes sister said chuck mollys been
devilin me for a hoss all her own for the
last month course this three-legged dogie
aint nothin to brag about still-whatll
yuh take for the lil runt bill

  couldnt think of it nohow i aint
never had a pet before i wanna see what
it feels like whatclia gonna do now
chuck

  eat les have a smile at the starlight
first

  aw right meet yuh there in half an
hour got a lil business to fix up first
high pockets



  oh yeah shore yapped chuck his
tongue in his cheek gotta go to the
blue pigeon an get yuh some smokin
huh

  cartridges cowboy cartridges was
the unsmiling reply as henderson straight-
way departed

  that blythe lady is shore handsome
the deserted chuck admitted to the gray
pony but she cant hold a candle to my
jane he added loyally

   i got a gentle hoss for yuh announced
henderson from the doorway of the blue
pigeon why-whatsa matter

   for miss blythe white-faced was staring
through the front window with wide fear-
stricken eyes

   that man she gasped her hands at her
breast hes followed me

 henderson wheeled and looked critically
at a passing rider the latter was a tall
 fellow mounted on a black-and-white pinto
he dismounted at the happy heart
hitching-rail tied his horse and went in

   you mean the gent on the paint pony
henderson turned to miss blythe

   yes she whispered miserably

  whats he done he asked coming
forward to the eounter and leaning on it
with spread arms

   the girl gazed blankly up at henderson
she presssed a shaking hand against her
throat the courage which had enabled
her to face the sheriff had forsaken her
utterly

  he said id never get away she
stammered through chattering teeth he
said hed follow me and find me and he
has

   it wont do him a bit o good guar-
anteed henderson taking possession of
her hand and patting it awkwardly
ill-ill be right back

  he swung about and started toward the
door

   no no cried miss blythe in a panic
and darted beneath the hinged flap at the
end of the counter and seized his arm with
both hands you mustnt she almost
sobbed you mustnt do anything you
mustnt do you hear

   he looked down at her his eyes frostily
sinister gently he strove to disengage her
fingers from their grip she clung the
harder and began to cry

   oh i wish i were dead she wept her
dark-brown head pressed against his sleeve

  this was different henderson decided
to postpone for a space his chat with the
pintos owner

  les talk it over he suggested its
almost six mike wont care if yuh lock
up without waitin for him to come back
here gimme the key an you skip right
over to the hotel ill see yuh after supper

  the distraught miss blythe snatched the
key from its hook between the ammunition
calendars slapped it into hendersons
hand and started streetward she started
back with equal suddenness for the tall
owner of the black-and-white pinto blocked
the doorway

he was a lithe citizen this person
broad-shouldered thin-flanked and
handsome with that dissolute form
of comeliness popularly ascribed to lucifer
the fallen angel

  at sight of the shrinking girl the mans
light eyes widened with enjoyment his
full bps parted in a smile henderson he
disregarded wholly lucifers horizon men-
tal and visual at that moment was the
frightened miss blythe

  this is shore luck averred the new-
comer taking a forward step and pushing
back his wide hat i never knowed when
i come in here for tobacco i was gonna find
you the bantering tone of his voice
changed abruptly to one of dark menace
as he drove the question at her whadja
run away for

  maybe she wouldnt choose to answer
henderson interposed mildly

  the stranger whirled like a cat ready
hand dropping

  dont advised henderson a pocket
derringers a handy lil thing he added
meaningly

  hendersons right hand was in his
trousers pocket a significant protuber-
ance bulged within that pocket the
would-be exponent of truculence promptly
hooked his thumbs in the armholes of his
vest and leaned back against the counter

  yore gettin careless continued hen-
derson softly yore holsters tied down
so yuh cant shoot from the hip an shes
wore out so bad the foresight has busted
through an snagged in the leather i could
a got yuh forty times while you was
wrestlin with yore gun youd oughta file
that foresight or buy a new holster-or
somethin
	adventure

 djever try mindin yore own business
 queried the stranger coldly

 when i feel like it

 they say a gent dont never get sick or
 nothin mindin his own business

 ive heard that too

 i aim to be in town a while

 stay as long as yuh like shes a free
 country

 maybe ill see yuh again

 dont strain yoreself

 i guess thisll be all for now joy ill
 be back later-when you aint so busy
 the lady will always be busy-to you
 henderson declared pleasantly

 think so

 shore as yore a foot high stranger
 listen here the minute you step in this
 store the minute you open yore yap to this
 lady you come a-runhin cause i will
 yore figurin on bein right busy
 sneered the stranger

 it aint no trouble to curry a lil short
 hoss no trouble a-tall

 well see

 my eyesights always been plumb good
 said henderson

 the stranger set his hat straight and
 jingled out into the street henderson
 watching through the window saw him
 stride quickly up to his horse seize him by
 the bit and kick the unfortunate animal
 six times in the stomach after which
 the stranger belted the pinto over the head
 with the butt of his wire-wound quirt
 kicked him again for good measure and
 swaggered into the happy heart

 henderson viewed the preceding exhibi-
 tion of brutality with indifference not
 that he was callous to the suffering of dumb
 animals he was by nature kind to his
 own and beat them only when necessity
 demanded that they be beaten but he
 was wholly of the cow-country and in the
 cow-country a mans horse is his chattel to
 do with as he will to interfere between
 them is inconceivable

 henderson turned back to miss blythe
 who was mopping her eyes with a totally
 inadequate handkerchief and fighting to
 regain control of herself she looked up
 at him bravely

 im an awful bub-baby she stuttered
 bub-but he sus-scares me so

 he wont no more come along now
 yore through for this day

 she obeyed him meekly

   i dont want any supper she said dully
 on the way to the hotel

   me neither we can go out back o the
 corral where we was before if yuh like an
 yuh can talk all yuh want

   he was taking it for granted that she was
 to tell him her troubles she seemed to
 take it for granted too

   i thought you were going to shoot him
 there in the store she told him with a
 shiver

   i couldnt a shot him he said simply
 not with what i had in my pocket i
 didnt have no derringer i just stuck my
 thumb against the cloth an bluffed him
 out

  miss blythe made no comment she
was realizing more and more fully that this
person with the washed-out gray eyes was
not as other men

chapter xi

a troublous tale

tm from the east she said sitting
on a split cracker-box behind the
corral while he squatted on one heel facing
her whitewillow minnesota father
died when i was a baby and mother died
last year there were only two of us then
my brother tim and myself tim couldnt
see any opportunity in whitewillow he
was always ambitious and always talking
about the west that was the place to
succeed in he had the western fever
badly

   after mother went tim decided to go
west he left me in whitewillow to wait
till he could send for me i worked for
the village dressmaker i can sew pretty
well and trim hats too

   tim wrote me that he had taken up a
claim ten miles east of marysville the
county-seat of fort creek county this
territory

  must a been on calf creek said
henderson

  it is-at the twin springs nodded
miss blythe three months ago tim
sent for me i came within the month
tims horse reared over backward tim
couldnt roll free in time the horn caught

	him in the stomach he only lived two
days

   the girl fell abruptly silent and looked
 out across the flats
high pockets



  henderson looked at the ground and
swore silently miss blythes clipped re-
cital was making it increasingly evident
that the burdens of this imperfect world
are not shared equally by men and women

  miss blythe planted her elbows on her
knees clasped her hands and continued

  i stayed on at the claim it was pretty
lonely but i didnt know what else to do
i didnt care to go back to yvhitewillow
i havent relatives there or anywhere that
i know of i tried to sell our cattle and
two of the horses i couldnt find a buyer
for them but i knew if i could stick it out
and prove up on the claim that i might
be able to sell it later and go somewhere
else where-where i could find my own kind
of work

 then sam bellows came thats the
man you drove out of the store-the man
im afraid of he saw me one day when
i rode into marysville for supplies and he
followed me out to the claim he tried to
make lul-love to me

  henderson remained outwardly calm
inwardly he seethed with a great seething

  i managed to throw a kettle of boiling
water at him she went on he jumped
backward and didnt get scalded much i
got tims gun and threatened to shoot him
if he didnt go away he went away but
he said hed come back he did-that
night he tried to break in and i fired
through the door and i heard him laugh
and ride away

  the next day i went to marysville and
appealed to the marshal for protection
the marshal laughed at me and said i must
have encouraged bellows encouraged
him i

  he came into the office while i was
talking to the marshal and the marshal
asked him about it bellows said he was
just trying to help me and that i imagined-
things the marshal told me to go home
and not bother him any more that i had
no business nestering on calf creek any-
way you see the marshal had a ranch
on the creek only a few miles from ours
and our cows used to run with his i expect
but we only had a few-forty-two head
and it really is free range

  it shore is maam lookit here why
didntcha go to judge allison

  judge allison i never heard of him
whos he

  the federal judge he lives in marys-

ville hes one white gent an hed a
seen yuh through

  oh i wish id known that but i
didnt and i went home as fast as i could
bellows came after me but i beat him to
the house and i rode the horse right into
the kitchen and barred the door again
i had the gun and i shot through the win-
dow at him but id ndver fired a gun before
and i missed him he walked right up to
the window and dared me to fire again
i wanted to fire again i couldnt i tried
and i couldnt he just stood there laugh-
ing at me while i was pointing the gun at
him but-he didnt come in he said
hed be back the next day and it wouldnt
do me any good to run away hed follow
and find me no matter where i went

  that night i packed some clothes in a
bag wrapped my blue dress and high shoes
in a slicker and nailed up the door i
hatedto leave the place it-it was my
home mine and tims but im going
back of course when things quiet down a
little i turned the other two horses out
of the corral so they could get grass and
water poor things and rode away i
traveled northwest till i came to a trail that
i knew must be the trail to farewell and
paradise bend i meant to go to paradise
bend

 so i changed to my blue dress and other
shoes where some box-elders grew beside
a little creek wrapped my corduroy skirt
and flannel shirtwaist in the slicker and
hid the bundle with my saddle and bridle
in the box-elders then i drove my horse
away and went back to the trail to wait for
the stage

  i had some money in a little bag pinned
inside my-my dress and i had some more
in my sus-stocking and while i was sitting
on my bag waiting for the stage i felt for
the money in my stocking and there was
only a big hole i suppose it chafed its
way through while i was riding anyway
it was gone

  but moneys heavy didnt yuh feel it
slippin dr somethin

  henderson reddened vividly

  i didnt feel it go you see it wasnt
in gold it was in bills-what id saved
while i worked in whitewillow well
i went back to the box-elders and hunted
and hunted but of course i didnt find it
in the morning when the stage came by
i took it and i found i only had enough


adventure

 to pay my way to farewell with a little
 over so now you know all about me-
 everything

 she rested her chin on her hands and
 stared unseeingly over hendersons head

 i see said he slowly i see yuh-
 say where didja try to sell them cows
 in marysville i didnt know where
 else to go

 whodjuh ask

 i asked the marshal first he owned
 the next ranch and i thought naturally
 hed be willing he wasnt though

 ask any one else

 i asked several other men and one did
 say he would if the price was right i made
 it right and he agreed to come out the next
 day and arrange things but he didnt
 come and when i saw him and asked him
 he said hed changed his mind and wouldnt
 buy at any price

 who might this changeable jigger be
 henderson asked softly

 his name is lafe scattergood

 oh lafe yeah i know lafe by sight
 what is yore iron maam-yore brand
 the lazy t left hip cows and horses
 i see well yuhd better go in the
 hotel now an dont think no more o whats

 quietly

 you mustnt pick a quarrel with

 i didnt say i was gonna-

 you dont have to say it i know
 exactly whats in your mind you mustnt
 shoot him

 but maam theys nothin else to do
 with a party like that

 never mind youve warned him thats
 enough

 spose now he dont believe in warnins
 suggested hopeful henderson

 youll have to wait till-till he does
 something i couldnt bear it if you killed

 him on my account unless-

 she hesitated

 yeah unless

 unless it were absolutely necessary
 and it isnt necessary now you yourself
 can see that you must promise me not
 to do anything to him till he gives you a
 reason

 he has already

 do you promise

  all right sulkily

  this means you mustnt go out of your

way to seek a quarrel

  all right i wont but if he comes
huntin one with me thats a heap dif-
ferent

  of course youre the judge in that
case youre awfully good mr hen-
derson i like you youre-youre nice

  she stood up quickly seized his big hand
where it hung over his knee pressed it
tightly between her warm palms and was
gone

  henderson got to his feet in a daze
he lifted the hand she had pressed and
inspected it closely front and back

  my gawd he wliispered in an awed
tone my gawd

chuck morgan was finishing
his fifth cup of coffee when hen-
derson joined him in the canton

  i didnt do no waitin in the starlight
remarked chuck with a wink i kind o
thought youd forget about it

  shore did when yuh get through
gugglin that coffee pass me the bread
me i could eat a raw dog howdy sing
luey how about a small steak with lots
o gravy taters fried thick an canned

  the inscrutable sing luey inclined a
grave head and padded kitchenward hurl-
ing ahead of him a long string of clicking
chinese

chuck

chucks ankle a hearty kick beneath the
table hes all right an hes a friend o
mine

lap now were even an you keep yore

sand down this dobie try it shes
good thisaway

  i might if they was any butter chuck
flung back and consoled himself with a
cigaret

  after supper henderson and chuck went
high pockets



out into the night and by devious ways
approached the dance-hall they did not
enter they lay full-length upon the
gentle slope of the lean-to attached to
dolans warehouse and looked in through
an open window it was a window of fair
size they could see the full length of the
bar the greater part of the dancing-floor
and the people respectively thereat and
thereon

   henderson followed with hard gloomy
eyes the gyrations of the five demi-mon-
daines

  id shore admire to know which o

them jezebels now-

  he did not complete the muttered
sentence

henderson moves

tt was long past midnight when chuck
sleeping lightly was awakened by the
pressure of hendersons fingers on his
wrist

   tsall right chuck lay quiet whis-
pered henderson his mouth close to
chucks ear lest their fellow-guests in the
room be awakened i gotta slide out

   taint necessary chuck said stiffly

gun myself you neednt think yore the
only he-man in the territory

  now thats right friendly chuck
commended henderson precisely as if he
had not known that his friend would rise
to the occasion yuhll shore help me a
lot thataway wheres willies old-
brother-in-law livin now

  on the lazy at the mouth o soogan
he moved camp there from someers up
packsaddle about two weeks ago

  then hes there yet so long
henderson carrying his boots under one
arm his war-bags under the other tiptoed
from the room he opened a dining-room
window leaned out and deposited boots
and war-bags on the ground his saddle
blanket and bridle followed the war-bags
henderson followed the saddle closed the
window noiselessly and resembling nothing
so much as a laden christmas tree made
his silent way to the corral

  the moonlight enabled him to catch up
his yellow horse without much trouble
but he was forced to ear the animal in order
to bridle him once the bit was between
the yellows jaws the rest was easy it was
not the ponys custom to fight the saddle

  henderson led the yellow out put up
the bars of the gate mounted and walked
his horse to the street here he turned
southward and struck into the marysville
trail the yellow horse began to single-
foot the easy gait which eats up the long
miles as fire eats the grass

  the rising sun met horse and rider
paralleling the marching skirmish lines of
cottonwoods fringing the course of soogan
creek not ten miles from where that
shallow stream empties into the lazy
river an hour and a half later hen-
derson topped a long ridge and saw a short
quarter-mile beyond his horses ears the
long broad reaches of the lazy river

in the lush grass on the triangular flat
between the northern bank of the lazy and
the eastern bank of soogan creek a horse-
band was grazing at the apex of the
triangle were the lodges of the rainbows
people

  there were four lodges three large and
one small for willies old-brother-in-
law was a man of family and substance
the family comprised one wife her two
grandmothers his two grandmothers five
assorted aunts divers children belonging
to the aunts and his niece the rainbow
the substance consisted of ninety or a
hundred ponies many skins dressed and
undressed and two dozen dogs the
latter could not be termed an asset

  the camp of human life lay deserted to
the eye when henderson rode in but the
dogs made him vociferously not welcome

  might know she wouldnt be here-
exclaimed henderson controlling with diffi-
culty his agitated horse

  that depends said the rainbow
suddenly appearing between the flaps of
the smallest lodge what she in par-
ticular are you looking for mister hen-
derson

  yoreself he told her grinning
thats nice the familys gone fishing
and im left sucking my thumbs and dying
for a man to talk to youll do quite well
git you devils

  the order was directed at the dogs
it was accompanied by an accurate stick
of firewood that solidly thumped the nearest
cur in the short ribs the pack fled
howling

  theyll be good now for a while she
observed smiling widely light and rest
your hat old-timer i think ill call you
bill mister henderson is so formal
help yourself

  i always do had any breakfast
  now howja know

jerky and beans old mexico style strike
you ill heat em up

  nemmine about heatin em i like
em cold

  you are hungry cold it is but i
will make coffee i could drink another
cup myself turn your horse out and be
happy

  henderson fashioned a rope halter with
expert fingers and picketed the yellow
horse with a thirty-foot sweep this lest
high pockets



the overheated animal drink himself into
a state of foundered uselessness then
henderson unsaddled and returned to the
rainbow and food

  still like joy as much as ever asked
the rainbow when she had filled his plate
with beans a second time

   shes one nice girl he parried

  isnt she you didnt answer my
question though but you neednt i
can tell by your ears theyre all red under

listened with shining eyes and flattering
attention

in conclusion

its all fixed youd better give me a
letter

pencil in my war-bags ill get em

excessively dirty work

twenty-four hours later henderson
was nearing the blythe homestead on
calf creek known locally as the twin
springs hendersons movements for the
last several miles had been furtive he
rode the draws and regarded the landscape
warily

  a scant half-mile from the springs he
dismounted between two short steep-sided
hillocks spattered with a careless growth of
jack-pine he anchored his horse to a
pine took from his off saddlebag a pair of
well-kept field-glasses and climbed the
higher of the two hillocks

  the last few yards of the ascent he made
on his hands and knees arriving at the
top he removed his hat lay down full-

length beneath a jack-pine and focused
his glasses on the blythe house and the
environs thereof

  a haze of yellow dust was over the
blythe corral a thin gray smoke as-
cended from the middle of the corral
across the windless air came faintly to his
ears the bawling of an indignant cow
hendersons mouth beneath the stubby
mustache straightened to a white line

  somebody aint losin a bit o time
he observed with wrath an i guess
i better not lose any either

  he returned hurriedly to his horse
loosed the reins and mounted without
touching the stirrup the yellow horse
knew what signified that flying mount
he laid back his ears tucked in his tail
and snapped at the bit

  slide feller slide rapped out hender-
son srnking his spurs split the breeze

  he whirled his quirt cross-handed and
cut the yellow horse again and again
behind the rear cinch the yellow flat-
tened out and flew he had rolled many
miles behind him since leaving farewell
and he was tired but he was not yet done
he responded to spurs and quirt with
every ounce of strength in his tough
muscles

  taking advantage of natural cover in
the shape of two dry washes and the
inevitable cottonwoods on the creek bank
henderson ran his horse to within four
hundred yards of the house profanely
praising the blessed fact that the house
lay between him and the corral he checked
his mount dismounted and knotted the
reins round a trees slim bole

  he dragged a winchester from the
scabbard under the right fender and went
forward on foot no indian could have
moved more quietly than did henderson
as he slipped through the cottonwoods
toward that place where smoke mingled
with dusty haze and cattle bawled their
protests

  tim blythe had cleared away the trees
on the creek bank in front of the house
and for a space of twenty yards on either
hand where the cover ended henderson
paused and crouched behind a red willow

  between the willow branches henderson
could see a goodly part of the corral stock-
ade where it projected beyond the house
and the smoke of the fire was plainly
visible above the stockade


adventure

  henderson waited until a sharp sudden
bawl proclaimed the laying on of a hot iron
then while the attention of the men in the
corral was concentrated on the work in
hand he slipped like a shadow across the
open ground and gained the shelter of the
house

  he dropped on his knees crawled rapidly
round the house on all fours and hugged
the wall at one corner with all care he
poked forth his hatless head and recon-
noitered one of hendersons winning
traits was the faculty of swift and all-
embracing observation under the cir-
cumstances a bare glance was sufficient
he withdrew his head and squatted back
on his heels

  he had seen that the gate of the corral
was distant not thirty yards that there
were at least a score of cows within the
enclosure and that upon one hog-tied
member of the band two men were operating
with a heavy iron and a wet blanket the
two men were the marysville marshal and
mr eliphalet scattergood the latter well
and unfavorably known among his kind as
lafe

  i wonder if theys any more pondered
henderson i couldnt see only two
ponies

  the question was important henderson
worked his crabwise way to the rear of the
house and looked in through a window
there was no one in that room the kitchen
it was a three-room house within sixty
seconds henderson was satisfied that the
domicile was untenanted he returned to
the corner from which he had spied upon
the dusty gentlemen in the corral and
leaned his rifle against the log wall

  just a lil dirty work now he thought
brightly an everythinll be hunkydory

  he took off the black and red polka-
dotted handkerchief that encircled his neck
and flattened it against a log then
employing for the purpose his pocket-
knife he jagged out three holes two
of these holes were on a line the third
some inches below and between them

  the holes completed henderson put the
handkerchief over his face and head in such
a manner that he was enabled to see through
the upper holes and breathe through the
lower holding the handkerchief in place
henderson settled his hat hard down on his
head experimentally he shook his head
the handkerchief flapped at the bottom

but the hat held the upper part firmly
henderson next removed his vest turned
it inside out and put it on after which
he pulled off his boots and set them upright
beside his rifle

  i hope they aint too many stones he
whispered anxiously as he drew his two six-
shooters

  only three more observed the marshal
to his friend mr scattergood and tossed
a steaming blanket into a pail of water

 an thats one - good thing

declared mr scattergood his fingers busily
employed in releasing the feet of a cow
this aint no job for two men which
i never worked so hard in my life

  keep on an youll shore work harder
feller remarked a genial voice from the
corral gate i got a picture o you
breakin stone-that is if yaint lynched
previous

  the backs of both men were toward the
gate neither man budged out of position
nor did he move so much as a finger the
marshal in the act of scratching a match
on his trousers when the voice broke upon
his ears balanced himself on one leg like a
crane the kneeling back-bent mr scat-
tergood stared dumbly at the cows hoof
between his paralyzed hands

  thats right commended the voice
cheerily hold it an watch for the pretty
bird a couple o clicks an yore pictures
took

  the unseen laughed with relish the
marshal swayed slightly it was the first
time he had ever been caught

  you feller with the match put yore leg
down an yore hands up went on the
voice the other jigger will stand up
slow pushin his hands out in front of him
an turn my way

bspt the marshal and mr scattergood
ipjfc followed their instructions to the
letter the latter facing the gate
saw a tall citizen his face masked by a red
and black polka-dotted handkerchief lean-
ing lazily over the bars the masked
individual wore a peculiar-looking vest
without buttons and his two six-shooters
bore directly upon mr scattergood and
his friend the marshal

  the gent lookin at me will now un-
buckle his belt an let er drop said the
unknown he wont be hurried about
it neither
high pockets



  mr scattergoods hands set about their
task with stiff lack of haste when his belt
and six-shooter were on the ground mr
scattergood was ordered to wheel about
and put his hands up with mr scatter-
good faced to the rear in the posture of a
signaler sending the letter u the tall
citizen began on the marshal

  turn loose yore belt an drop her you
other feller were his words then you
can turn round too first puttin up yore
hands

  the marshal obeyed quite as meticu-
lously as had mr scattergood

  you aint wearin no star on that vest
complained the tall citizen aint you
got no star

  no yapped the badgered marshal
thats shore tough i was hopin you
had one im makin a collection o stars
dontcha think now if yuh tried real hard
yuh could maybe dig up a lil star out o
yore pockets-usin one hand o course
no barked the marshal

  dont yell yuh hurt my feelins when
yuh do an my feelins  shore be dam-
aged if you dont gimme a star yuh wont
do no such thing huh im sorry

  bang smack the tall citizens off-gun
spat flame and smoke a bullet cut the
ground between the marshals feet

  turn yore right foot slanchways feller
requested the tall citizen im gonna
shoot off yore boot-heel is yore ankle
insured with my feelins all tore up an
jangled thisaway i might shoot high or
somethin

  dont shoot begged the marshal
ill get it

  he slowly lowered his right arm pro-
duced from an upper vest-pocket an object
that glittered and held it out at arms
length

  drop her on yore belt thats the boy
now both o yuh come over here quick
mr scattergood and the marshal fran-
tically rushed the gate

   taint necessary to climb over
drawled the unknown backing away
they was a couple o cows gonna drift
in between us an i didnt wanna lose sight
o yuh you might a felt like gamblin
with me aint it amazin he added in
his pleasant voice how easy yuh can
change the lazy t into the barred
box

  the two worthies behind the gate

glowered the marshal spat upon the
dusty earth

  i spose yuh was figurin on drivin over
to the dry mountains went on the tall
citizen an sellin em for beef to the
miner folks was that the idea dont
say nothin if yuh dont wanna im a
good guesser twenty-two cows in here
that leaves twenty out on the range have
yuh blotted their brands yet well it
dont matter its none o my business
im only a poor lonesome road-agent but
i never robbed no women yet yore a
couple o skunks aintcha they aint
nothin worsen a skunk is they-cept you
two gents yore so low down a rattle-
snake sticks up over yuh like afreight-
wagon over a couple o toads

  you go to- snarled mr scatter-
good

  before i do said their unruffled
captor spose you go over an get yore
two ponies get the one thats stilt-
holdin the cow first an dont go foolin
for no winchester while yore lettin loose
that rope an dont dodge behind no cow
mr scattergood did as he was told
when he returned leading the two ponies
the marshal was ordered to open the gate

  cmon out now directed the unknown
yuh might swing the gate shut again you
the coyote holdin the hosses will tie em
to the top rail the other polecat will
walk out into the clear about forty steps
an stop without turnin round drift
an drift quick through with them
ponies all right you trot out after
yore friend an kick him in the pants
which fantastic order caused the marshal
to half-turn and mr scattergood to stare
in slack-jawed amazement

  yuh heard what i said the tall citizen
drawled fly at it i aint searched you
fellers for hide-outs so im takin a chance
but ill keep my peepers open dontcha
fret get a-goin you hop-toad get a-goin
an kick him good sos i can hear it

  one of the unknowns two guns cracked
as he spoke mr scatlergoods hat
twitched and two round holes appeared in
the high crown

  start im tellin yuh continued the
tall citizen or will i have to part yore
hair

  thus adjured and encouraged mr scat-
tergood did not linger he walked right
out swung his leg and dealt the marshal a


adventure

sincere and hearty kick the marshal
grunted and shuffled his feet

   now marshal whooped the tall citi-
 zen whatcha gonna do gonna take it
 lyin down gwan hit him whang
 him good im tellin yuh to show me a
 fight you two gents

  the stung marshal whirled on his toes
and pasted mr scattergood squarely on
the nose not to be outdone mr scatter-
good jolted the marshal in the stomach
the marshal bored in with flailing arms
mr scattergood met him less than half-
way and closed the official left eye the
marshal running true to form descended
to the low tactics of the hoodlum and
kicked mr scattergood in the shins
snarling with rage mr scattergood swung
his right to the marshals mouth and
repeated with his left

  spitting blood and teeth the marshal
closed with his companion in misery and
endeavored to choke him mr scatter-
good contrived to grip a double handful of
the marshals hair mr scattergood ripped
and tore the marshal suffering the most
exquisite pain strove to gouge mr scatter-
good but only succeeded in removing a
three-inch strip of skin from above mr
scattergoods left eyebrow

   mr scattergood hooked his heel behind
 the marshals leg both men fell to the
 ground the marshal underneath in the
 fall the marshals hair was wrenched free
 incidentally some of it was wrenched out
 promptly the marshal wound both arms
 round the neck of mr scattergood and
 twisted his own body to one side the
 tangled pair flopped over with a jerk mr
 scattergood was now underneath

   the marshal drove his knee into the solar
 plexus of mr scattergood the latter
 went limp with a wheeze kneeling upon
 the senseless form of mr scattergood the
 victorious marshal out of his one service-
 able eye looked about him for a rock with
 which to further dent the features of his
 comrade an ancient friendship had in-
 deed been shattered

   at this juncture long fingers inserted
 themselves between the collar of the
 marshal and his neck he was yanked
 backward and flung down in a huddle
 he sat up acutely conscious that he ached
 in all parts of him and waggled an abraded
 chin the masked citizen sitting back on
 his heels a few yards away surveyed the

puffed and battered countenance of the
marshal

  i aint got no kick cornin a-tall said
the unknown i dunno when ive seen

a better fight you fellers done well-

well i didnt think yuh had it in yuh
honest i didnt yuh neednt go to get up
after yore hat now just sit still till yore
friend pulls round hell be all right in a
shake hes breathin better already

chapter xiv

the bargain

the tall citizen shepherded the two
staggering men to their horses

  ive took the rifles off o yore saddles
sos yuh wont be tempted he said
now he went on when they had made
their very clumsy mounts start off slow-
no this way i wanna be able to watch
yuh while im pullin on my boots after
yuh get across calf creek head east for
them hills shes five miles across that flat
an id go straight across if i was you
ive got a cayuse cached round here an
i might come after yuh an show yuh the
way if yuh forget an drift north or south

after yuh get to the hills i dont give a-

whatcha do im goin someers else myself
pretty prompt i hear this country aint
healthy for road-agents-or brand-blot-
ters

  the two thoroughly chastened men made
no remark they rode down to the creek
splashed across and headed toward the
distant hills the tall citizen pulling on
his boots watched them go not till they
were three hundred yards away did he
remove his handkerchief mask he knotted
it round his neck turned his vest and
built himself a cigaret

  im bettin them two jiggers will be in
marysville tomorrow henderson said
aloud yessir im shore gamblin on
that an they wont be expectin to meet
no road-agent neither

  he went into the corral took from the
pail the soaked blanket and wrung it out
he retrieved the marshals star and put it
in an inside vest-pocket he up-ended the
pail over the fire and gathered up the belts
with their dangling six-shooters and the
heavy running-iron used by the men in
their brand-blotting and dumped the
articles into the blanket he folded the
high pockets



blanket over and over till he had a compact
bundle

  he dropped the bundle beside his
winchester and picked up the rifles he
had taken from the two men he scouted
round the house till he found a small
opening between a foundation log and the
ground through this opening he shoved
the rifles one after the other at the full
stretch of his arm he threw several hand-
fuls of earth into the opening and tamped
with a vigorous boot-toe

  them rifles may not be needed he
reflected but a extra ace in a deal like this
aint to be sneezed at

  he returned to the front of the house
and gazed across the flats the retreating
figures of the marshal and mr scattergood
were dots in the distance they were
keeping a remarkably straight course

  guess ill get the lil hoss said hen-
derson sos i can turn loose these cows
no use waitin no longer

  he picked up the blanket bundle and his
rifle and walked swiftly back to his horse
he awakened the dozing animal tied the
bundle into his slicker swung up and
trotted to the corral he opened the gate
without dismounting and rode in he
drove out every cow whirling a doubled
rope and yelling at the top of his lungs he
drove those cows west and north he
spent an active hour and when he ceased
to shout and spur the cattle were scattered
in the draws and hollows of a region several
miles square

  nothin like scatterin the evidence
where they wont find it in a hurry is they
he inquired of the horse cmon feller
well go back to the creek an give yuh one
fine lil drink an then men youll sift along
to marysville

  the stars were out when henderson rode
his tired horse into marysville he dis-
mounted in front of judge allisons house
the judge was standing on the porch
henderson could see the white gleam of his
shirt-sleeves

  its me judge he said stepping upon
the porch bill henderson

  with the accent on the henderson
whispered the judge gripping his hand
warmly ill have black sam attend to
your horse youll stay with me of
course

  it might look better if i stayed at the
hotel judge said henderson softly

  so thats it i might have known
youll eat with me though i shant take
no on that

  well ive always liked yore grub
judge ill be right back soons i go to
the hotel an get me a bed an see the lil
hoss fed i got a small pack here id like
to leave with yuh an i wouldnt want for
nobody to see it

  ill put it in the sideboard where i keep
my whisky the doors are always locked
this it

  henderson handed the blanket bundle
to the judge

  kind o damp an heavy he cautioned
and returned to his waiting horse

  he left his mount at the hotel corral
bespoke horse-feed and made good his
claim to a bed by the simple method of
piling his war-bags on an unoccupied
cot

  as he passed through the barroom on his
way to the street a man entered it was
dunlavy the wells fargo agent

  whens sam bellows cornin back
dunlavy asked the bartender

  i dunno replied the bartender
henderson sat down on a chair and
slowly rolled a cigaret

  didnt he say persisted dunlavy

  if he had id tell yuh sam drifted an
i dumio even where

  well theys a saddle bridle spurs an
a pair o angora chaps-leastwise thats
what the bill says-in the office for him
come in on the stage today from pueblo
colorado

  blaziers huh

  yes an the bill says collect an id
like to

  yuh neednt look at me thataway
grinned the bartender swabbing off the
bar yuh wont do no collectin here
dunlavy departed swearing henderson
smoked his cigaret to the butt bought
some cigars for his friend the judge and
went out into the street and walked un-
hurriedly to the latters house

  judge said henderson when black
sam had served the supper and the kitchen
door was shut i might want to ask a favor
of yuh tomorrow

  say when smiled the judge

  i might ask a couple o fellers in here
sos i can talk to em private-like

  the house is yours judge allison
waved a plump and hospitable hand


adventure

  im obliged i might be needin the
key to that sideboard too

  heres a duplicate said the judge
detaching a key from a clinking bunch and
tossing it across the table

  an this aint all went on henderson
pocketing the key id sort o like yuh
to be in yore office across the hall while im
talkin to them fellers i might wanna ask
yore advice

  the judge cocked a heavy eyebrow and
tapped the dull butt of one of two six-
shooters in shoulder-holsters that cuddled
his ribs beneath his armpits

  no henderson shook his head and
dropped an eyelid legal advice
sometimes i wish i was not a judge
grieved the jurist or that justice was not
supposed to be blind are you planning
anything illegal never mind he added
hastily dont tell me id rather not
know but if you have in view a smoky
session wouldnt the corral do as well i
dislike to seem discourteous or lacking in
hospitality but-i rather value the mirror
in my sideboard

  im gamblin they wont be no smoke
henderson assured him leastwise not if
i can help it

  i know youll do your best bill have
some more coffee no well then have
a drink that whisky came to me from
louisville a month ago its thirty years
old smooth as honey and mellow as a
ripe sheepnose

  thank you i will have a little nip
later in the evening henderson and the
judge strolled into the bound-to-come
saloon whose enterprising proprietor keen
to provide the honest dollar with other
than a liquid outlet ran games in the back
room

  the judge inserted his ample bulk in a
game of stud

  henderson did not play he moved
aimlessly about when he wasnt talking to
the bartender and drifted into the street
before eleven oclock

  from the bound-to-come he went to the
thanksgiving where likewise men could
drink or play cards as the spirit moved
them here again henderson did not pick
up a hand and here again he held casual
converse with the bartender

  before midnight was thirty minutes old
henderson was asleep on his cot at the
hotel

in the morning he repaired to the
office of the judge and borrowed
paper pen and ink he consumed
the better part of an hour in filling several
sheets of legal cap with spacious hand-
writing

  he read through his completed work with
care decided that he had been sufficiently
specific and made two meticulous copies
which being done he signed the lot placed
original and copies in three separate en-
velopes and handed them to the judge

  if i aint back by ten oclock said
henderson or if anythin happens to me
before yuh might open one o them en-
velopes an read whats inside

  right smiled judge allison and
pigeon-holed the envelopes

  from the judges house henderson went
to the general store of mr eliphalet scat-
tergood the owner was assisting his clerk
in the unpacking of sundry cases of air-
tights mr scattergood looked much the
worse for wear he had changed his
clothes but the appearance of his face and
the cramped manner in which he moved
his arms and legs would have led any one
without knowledge of the facts into the
belief that a mule or other equally muscular
animal had assaulted mr scattergood with
intent to kill

  henderson bought tobacco and was
waited upon by the clerk henderson
went away in search of the marshal that
gentleman was found in his office he too
had changed his clothes he too had
certainly been engaged in desperate con-
flict to manifest the slightest curiosity
concerning the troubles of other men is
tabu in cowland circles henderson gazed
without interest upon the marshals beaten
countenance

mornin marshal was hendersons
greeting uttered in a harsh hoarse tone
wanna sell some cows-three-year olds
sell em if i get my price the marshal
grunted sourly

  maybe now we can get together on the
price-if she aint too steep

  how many djuh want

  depends on the price listen here
i aint even got time to ride out to yore
ranch an inspect any cattle youll have
to drive-in here an the judgell look em
over for me he knows cows an hes a
friend o mine les go down to his place
an fix it up
high pockets



  the marshal nodded stood up stiffly
and tenderly and stiffly and tenderly
buckled on his six-shooter the gun had
seen service but the holster and the car-
tridge-belt were brand new

  when the two came in sight of judge
allisons house the jurist was sitting on the
front porch a weighty calf-bound volume
lay open across the judicial knees he gave
them an abstracted good morning as
they drew near and went on with his
reading

  about the cattle deal yore gonna help
me with judge said henderson not for-
getting to speak hoarsely and harshly
can we use yore dinin-room till we get the
price settled

  by all means bill make yourselves
at home the judge wondered where
henderson had picked up that sudden cold

  we might want yuh to help us out later
judge-if yore round

  ill be in my office when you want me
ive three hours work ahead on a most
interesting case so take your time

  the judge ushered them into the dining-
room and crossed the hall to his office and
closed the door henderson closed the
dining-room door in through the open
side-windows from the direction of the
corral floated the trilling lilt of black sams
whistle making melody of beulah land
there was no danger of that which hen-
derson intended saying to the marshal being
overheard

  the marshal let himself carefully down
upon a chair henderson took a key from
his pocket the marshal glanced at the
key then rapidly and unbelievingly winked
his one available eye for hendersons
other hand held a gun and the round
muzzle of the gun gaped across the table
at the marshals chest

  put yore hands on the table marshal
henderson requested in his natural tone of
voice

  the marshal slowly spread his hands flat
on the table he licked his tongue catwise
over his dry and puffy ups

by gawd he whispered by gawd
yore rememberin the lonesome road-
agent huh henderson queried cheerfully

  the marshals face was expressionless
henderson without losing for an instant
the magic of the drop backed to the side-
board slid the hand holding the key behind
him and opened the sideboard door he

crouched searched within a moment and
straightened in his hand he held a heavy
blanket bundle

  he laid the bundle on the table the
ironmongery within chinked suggestively

  yore guns an the runnin-iron are in
here henderson said softly yore stars
in my pocket

  the marshal remained dumb

  yore rifles-yores an lafes-are cached
someers near the blythe ranch went on
henderson i dunno as i wanna buy no
cows-now but i guess maybe you do
whadda you mean grated the mar-
shal

  i mean yore gonna have a chance-
a chance no rustler ever got before but

yuh would be lynched i gotcha fannin
yore ears on a pin marshal heres all
the evidence except the rifles an i seen
what i seen an i guess a juryd believe
it-knowin me

  i thought yore face was familiar came

the husky whisper yore bill-

  nemmine about no names henderson
interrupted swiftly yuh know me now
an so you be happy yuhve learned
somethin an heres the rest o the lesson
when a certain lady tried to sell her cattle
here yuh didnt wanna buy an yuh stopped
lafe scattergood from buyin yore blister
of a mind had a better idea when this
lady needed protection from sam bellows

too if you go makin bad medicine
you fellers the deals off yore good eye

thin huh yore thinkin maybe if im
rubbed out yuhd be safe yeah is that
it well ill just snub up that notion

copies them two copies will be planted
in two national banks where i know the
cashiers an this bundle an yore star goes

structions on their envelopes sayin how

see the longer i live unshot the longer

  spose-spose yore killed an we dont
have nothin to do with it

  then you an lafe better straddle yore
fastest cayuses an punch the breeze
but-

  they aint no buts not one lil lil
but yore out on a limb marshal yuh
gotta drop

  yore blackmailin by gawd

  the marshals guttural snarl was as
defiant as the man could make it but a
clammy sweat was on his forehead and the
chilly talons of a sickening fear clutched at
his evil soul he had money had the
marshal he had a standing he had
been caught shame new-born pounced
down and made holiday with fear in the
conception of which shame conscience had
no part it was shame at being found out
at being helpless before a better man-the
bitter shame the sinful know when nemesis
lays them by the heels

  the marshals lips writhed apart he
showed his teeth he panted at the calm
citizen behind the gun

  yore blackmailin he repeated
yore blackmailin

  aw right said henderson ill just
call in judge allison tell him what i know
an show him whats in the blanket like-
wise yore star then a posse will ride over
to the blythe ranch an search out them
two winchesters between them rifles an
the brand-blotched cattle i throwed out
on the range an all the rest of it you an
lafe had oughta get ten years apiece-if
yuh aint lynched first

  maybe lafe wont agree the marshal
suggested faintly

  you got fifteen minutes to persuade
him said henderson briskly if youn
him aint here inside one lil quarter-hour
im gonna blat

  howd i know youll keep yore word
chattered the marshal

  im hard o hearin today but i
thought you said howd i know youll
keep yore word didja

  i did not im-im goin now

 wait a shake i wanna show you
somethin first les go in the judges
office you an me

  henderson hooked an affectionate arm
in the crook of the marshals elbow but
the officer was not deceived he could feel
the hard muzzle of the six-shooter nudging
his ribs arm in arm the two entered the
judges office judge allison overflowing
a tip-tilted chair his feet on the window-
sill was enjoying a cigar and reading the
calf-bound volume

  can i use yore desk a minute judge
said henderson skilfully concealing the six-
shooter under the flap of his vest

  certainly replied judge allison with-
out turning his head

henderson seated the marshal
before the desk from a pigeon-
hole he took the three envelopes
opened them and flattened the contents
on the desk beneath the marshals eyes

  read and sign henderson whispered
tactfully in the marshals ear theys the
pen yonder

  the marshal read with emotion-emotion
that was nauseating his body shook a
little the six-shooter tentatively poked
him in the ribs

  theys the pen reminded henderson
at that moment in the marshals opin-
ion henderson was the very devil indeed
and judge allison within ten feet the
trap had been fairly sprung the marshal
coughed to conceal a groan and stretched
forth a hand to grasp the pen

  when the three papers had each been
signed henderson replaced them in their
envelopes returned the envelopes to the
pigeon-hole and took the marshal back
into the dining-room and closed the
door

  i thought maybe yuhd feel more like
persuadin lafe if you signed first

 
high pockets



henderson explained brightly grinning at
the marshal

  words failed the marshal his knees felt
strangely weak nevertheless he managed
to effect a conventional if somewhat
hurried withdrawal

  the judge stared wonderingly out of the
window he thought of the marshals
bruised face the scratching of a hurrying
pen and the speedy fashion of the mans
packing off

  this is interesting mused judge alli-
son very interesting i wonder what
its all about

  within twelve minutes from the time of
his exit the marshal returned with him
came mr scattergood there was fear
in the expression of mr scattergood hen-
derson in the dining-room perceived that
fear the judge looking through his win-
dow saw eye to eye with henderson

  damnation murmured the judge who
was but human bills using me for his
own fell purposes and wont tell me a word
damnation

  cmon in invited henderson as the
marshal and mr scattergood hesitated on
the porch

  they entered mr scattergood with
diffidence and the marshal kicked the door
shut with a bang mr scattergood started
nervously henderson smiled he had
not drawn his gun but his washed-out gray
eyes were alert as a hungry tigers

  might as well sit down he suggested
civilly

  they sat with much scraping of chair
legs the marshal gazed sulkily at hen-
derson mr scattergood stared in sullen
fascination at the blanket bundle on the
table henderson leaned back agaiust the
sideboard one thumb was caught in his
belt the other the left was thrust into
the waistband of his trousers

  about them cattle he began bruskly
the price o them cowsll be five thousand
dollars

  five thousand dollars for forty cows
exclaimed the marshal gaping in amaze

  mr scattergood rubbed a worried hand
across his gulping throat

  forty-two cows corrected henderson
all good an fat lazy t an barred box
brands

  i aint got that much money denied
mr scattergood

  only twenty-five hundred from you

  explained henderson the marshal takes
the other half

  i aint got no twenty-five hundred
lamented the marshal

  me neither chimed in mr scatter-
good

  that is tough commiserated hen-
derson i suppose ill have to tell the
judge after all

  maybe-maybe i can borrow it sur-
rendered the marshal

  i dunno where i can get it mr scatter-
good affirmed faintly

  id scratch my head an think advised
henderson you two chunkers make me
sick yuh got money both of you
dont try to tell me different marshal
with yore ranch an all yore worth twenty
thousand easy an lafe if you cant dig
up thirty thousand ill eat my hoss i want
a thousand apiece in cash an ill take yore
checks on the first national in piegan city
where i know yuh got accounts for the
rest

  yuh aint got no power of attorney
protested mr scattergood

  yore a helluva gent to yap about power
of attorney i didnt notice no power of
attorney when you an yore friend was
blottin them cows not only will yuh
gimme that two thousand an write them
checks makin em payable to miss joy
blythe but yore gonna write a letter each
o yuh to the first nationals cashier

dont hear from the first national inside
o seven days  take it yore not keepin
yore side o the bargain an act accordin
see how easy ive fixed it for yuh all
yuh gotta do is take yore pen in hand

  he looked expectantly at the two
rogues

  the two rogues looked each upon the
other and there was no affection in their
eyes they turned their faces toward
henderson and slowly nodded their
wretched heads

  thats the ticket henderson said
warmly the judge has a first national
check-book well go right in his office
where theys plenty to write with an
while were in there lafe will spread his
name on them three lil reports o mine

  and lafe did

chapter xv

hot iron

from marysville henderson two thou-
sand dollars in gold tied up in the
slicker behind his cantle rode north he
did not push his horse and he traveled by
way of the bar s line camp on packsaddle
creek and the  ranch-house

  he remained a day and a night at the
latter place and spent a great deal of time
in conversation with his friend tom
dowling and lanpher the grumpy man-
ager

  he learned among other bits of more
important information that mr simms
was resting easily in the managers own
bed and bade fair to make a good recovery
he did not visit mr simms he felt that
under the circumstances such procedure
would be indelicate

  the miles between the  and farewell
were covered without incident the hotel
guests were at dinner when henderson
dismounted at the corral he could hear
the clinking of knives and forks and scraps
of conversation he heard chucks voice
and miss blythes low laugh and he smiled

  guess sams been a good boy was his
thought as he went to the kitchen door
after stripping off saddle and bridle and
turning his horse into the corral

  howdy mis lainey he said taking
off his hat to the angular woman busy at
the range guess ill eat out here if
yuhll sling some beans an beef on a plate
an gimme a cup o coffee

  why shore smiled mrs lainey ever
appreciative of courtesy she received but
seldom i was wonderin when youd
be back theys the basin an soap on
the bench waters in the pail under-
neath ill get you a clean towel

  after supper he said when she handed
him the food i wish yuhd ask miss
blythe to come out here to the corral

  he sat down facing his saddle on the log
near the corral gate and ate his supper
the meal finished and cup and dish re-
turned to mrs lainey he returned to the
log and rolled a satisfied cigaret his eyes
strayed to the bulgy slicker on the saddle

  that ought to help a lil bit he told
himself with that an the money in the
piegan city bank she can go way an do
what she wants

the half-smile faded the stubby mus-

tache straightened his face became
serious he rested his elbows on his
knees and surveyed the smoke spiral ing
upward from the glowing tip of his cigaret
he knew that he did not wish miss blythe
to go away and by his own carefully-
planned actions he had made it possible
for her to do that very thing he had
not previously considered the matter in
this light

  she would certainly go away-denver
chicago or some other equally impossible
place that every week she remained in
farewell was costing him an amount pro-
portionate to half the monthly wages of
a good puncher troubled him not at all
he would cheerfully have gone on paying
down till the end of time

  he dropped the cigaret and ground it
into the earth with the sole of his boot
and swore gently then he sprang up
and removed his hat for miss blythe was
coming out of the kitchen door

  yore lookin better he informed her
when he had shaken hands and was sitting
beside her on the log

  am i

  she lifted grave dark eyes in a swift
glance and dropped them again

  shore yuh-yuh dont look scared o
nothin now

  perhaps im not any more she said in
a low voice

  bellows still here

  yes she nodded

  has he done what i told him

  he surely has i dont think hell ever
bother me again 

  well hope so-on his account i
stopped at yore ranch maam while i was
away- an i sold yore cattle

  you sold my cattle she repeated eyes
wide with amazement

  i know it was kind o nervy but i seen
a good chance so i done it i sold the
ranch too

  miss blythe gasped

  would you mind repeating that she
asked when she could speak

  i sold yore ranch an yore cattle maam
i know it was nervy like i say but yuh
told me you wanted to sell em so i done it
im sorry if yore mad but i can fix it up

sos yuh can have everythin back an-

  im not mad im glad-glad but
how did you manage it when the claim
hasnt been proved up
high pockets



  oh the fellers are gonna put a jigger
on it to hold her down an prove up for em
i guess but that dont matter inside
the slicker on my saddle is two thousand
dollars an a bill o sale an a quit-claim
deed for you to sign

  two thousand dollars

  two thousand in the slicker an three
thousand more to yore account in the first
national bank at piegan city yuhll be
notified in two - three days now if yuh
aint lemme know

  but-but-why thats five thousand
dollars

  yore rithmetics fine maam

  the claim and the cows cant be worth
all that

  oh yes they are i dunno but what
them fellers would a paid more they was
a heap anxious to buy-a heap anxious
who are they

  the marysville marshal an lafe scat-
tergood he told her yeah yeah i
know he added hastily they might not
a wanted to buy one time but they
changed their minds when they seen how
good the claim an the cows was i talked
it up to em best i knowed an they just
couldnt help but buy

  she looked at him a slight frown between
her curving eyebrows

  you mean to say those two men paid
five thousand dollars for forty-two cows
and a quarter-section

  she crossed her knees clasped her hands in
her lap and cocked a skeptical head at him

  they was two hosses-three hosses-
besides the one you rode will likely drift
back some time

  oh nonsense mister henderson do
be serious

  i am dontcha go frettin over this
deal maam the marshal an lafe figured
they was gettin it cheap i dunno but what
they thought they was gold in them hills
no ones ever found any west of the
dry mountains my brother told me
you never can tell not in this country
so if yore satisfied with what i done ill
give you the money in the slicker an get it
off my hands

l  j he leaned sidewise and began
to unfasten the knots in the saddle-
strings she promptly seized his
elbow with both hands and pulled him up-
right

  you take care of it she implored i
wouldnt know what to do with it

  yuh could go way like yuh told me yuh
wanted

  he stared down at her anxiously

  i guess i dont want to go away as much
as i did im getting to know people here
and-and everybodys so friendly and nice
to me i like keeping store maybe
mister flynn would let me buy a half-
interest do you think he would

  i guess maybe but i cant keep this
money shed ought to be in a bank
someers tell yuh what ill give her
to buck saylor to put in the wells fargo
safe buck he sleeps right in the office
with two dogs they aint nobody gonna
get gay with the express companys money
while bucks in there

  yes do that thatll be fine but-
but must you do it right away youre
awfully provoking mister henderson you
keep doing the most wonderful things for
me and then you rush off without saying
two words to me cant you stay and talk
to me a little while im lonely

  she looked at him wistfully

  when a pretty girl looks at you wistfully
and tells you shes lonely there is but one
thing to do quite so

  at nine oclock mr lainey wandered
out into the dark kitchen and bumped into
his wife who was sitting on a chair gazing
fixedly out of the window

  look where yore goin yuh overgrown
punkin she ordered him fiercely keep
quiet

  whatsa matter he asked bewilderedly
bill henderson an joy blythe are
a-settin out on that log by the corral gate
they been settin there since after supper
an he aint kissed her yet im waitin
till he does

  maybe he dont wanna kiss her
suggested mrs laineys husband

  yore a fool bill lainey who wouldnt
wanna kiss her sweet face

  i dont

  lemme catch yuh just lemme once
i wish they wasnt so far off id like to
hear what theyre sayin

  well they are an yuh cant an i
wanna cup o coffee wheres the lamp
the romance-hungry mrs lainey arose
arid felt in the corner for the broom but
her husband fled before she found it she
returned to her observation post in time


adventure

to see henderson and miss blythe walking
streetward

  ten minutes later henderson left miss
blythe at the door of the hotel miss
blythe buck saylors receipt snug and
warm in the bosom of iher gown went to
her room henderson started system-
atically to find chuck morgan

  he found him after a search of half an
hour sitting on the counter of the blue
pigeon listening raptly while mike flynn
held forth on life as it is lived by the natives
of the south sea islands

  is that all they wear chuck was
asking at the moment of hendersons
entrance

  shore not another stitch mike re-
plied add a war-club for the min or
maybe a trade-knife an yuh have their
complate costume there aint-heres
bill hare yuh stranger

  howdy mike howdy chuck how
long yuh been broke chuck

  he sat down beside the puncher and
under cover of chucks wing chaps heavily
rammed his friend with a strong and
stiffened thumb

  broke repeated chuck meanin
how

   well i looked in all the saloons for yuh
an nobodyd seen yuh since noon so
knowin you i knowed yuh must be broke
is that so is that so i aint sayin
a word about present company but when
the barkeep sees me cornin he dont trot
out no pail nawsir i aint no human
sponge im a moral man i am but if
yore gonna slide an go splash ill trail
along an pull yuh out

   chuck slid off the counter with a jingling
thud of spurred heels

  once in the street henderson turned in
the direction of the canton chuck took
the outside edge of the sidewalk

  yore punchin me with yore thumb
thataway wasnt no accident said chuck
in a low voice whats up

  lots-i hope just now i gotta talk
with sing luey hes in the canton alone
i seen him when i come by if hes still
alone youn mell go in an borrow matches
so shell look natural from the street i
gotta talk to sing luey private-just
youn me see

  the canton was empty of guests sing
luey a lamp on the table at his elbow sat
hump-shouldered on a stool and sucked his

long silver-mounted pipe he rose as they
entered and bowed gravely

  wanna borrow a match sing luey
henderson announced in a loud tone
then in a whisper his lips barely moving
he added i gotta talk to yuh send yore
cook in here an let us in at the back door
sing lueys inscrutable face did not move
a muscle

  here are matches he said for the
rest you shall have what you desire in five
minutes

  the two departed in exactly five
minutes no more no less sing luey opened
the kitchen door to henderson and chuck
morgan

an hour later the door opened
and the two white men stumbling a
little in the darkness issued and
tiptoed their cautious way to the rear of
kennedys stable there they sat them
down and made cigarets

  im bettin itll work observed chuck
with his thumbnail scratching a match
alight inside his hat

  if it dont theys other ways said
henderson pinch her out ill light up
from yore pill

  the rainbow oughta sift in tomorrow
remarked chuck proffering his cigaret

  she ought henderson said leaning
forward to get a light hows sam been
actin since i left yuh he asked between
draws

  spendin most o his time in the dance-
hall an his money in the happy heart
buckin longhorns games

  irrigate much

  never think it henderson denied
mindful of his promise to miss blythe
i aint lookin for no fight whatever it
high pockets



aint exactly out of my way to go over to
the dance-hall neither im just gonna
browse round an be sociable if sam is
huntin trouble an searches me out i gotta
defend myself dont i what could be
fairer than that huh

  hendersons manner and tone were so
earnest that chuck was mystified

  why shore shore said he why
not whatcha askin me for

  henderson stood up and scratched his
head

  i dunno he said truthfully cmon

  they entered the dewdrop and gravi-
tated to the bar taking their places at the
end near the street door as behooved
gentlemen unpopular with the management
the bartender served them in silence
cupping their left hands round their
glasses they slouched sidewise against the
wood and surveyed the scene of what men
in their blindness miscall gaiety

  the dewdrop was as busy as a church
fair the barkeeper was not idle a moment
nor were the customers two of the latter
had early in the evening as it was gone
down into the pit whence they had been
digged and were sleeping the sleep of the
drunken on the floor against the wall where
they would be reasonably safe from careless
feet

  the five women were earning their wages
quite literally by the sweat of their brows
dancing on a hot night ceases to be a form
of recreation-if it ever was for them-
and becomes an exercise the perspiration
trickled down their faces and made little
channels in the powder and the paint
but their hard eyes gleamed brightly as
ever in the lamplight and their carmined
lips tossed rabelaisian quips at favored
friends with unabated vigor

  upon a window sill sam bellows sat
alone beyond a quick glance of recog-
nition as henderson entered he paid the
latter no attention there were other men
leaning against walls and sitting on tip-
tilted chairs in places they were shoulder
to shoulder but there was a space of several
feet on sam bellows either hand which
was natural men that hold life lightly
and take it in the same manner are not
beings with whom one can feel wholly at
ease

  the fiddler on his-table cut short la
paloma without the customary flourish
and wiped his dripping chin

  hot aint it he said to kansas casey
who was sitting on the table edge swinging
his legs

  ybetcha replied the deputy

  the couples crowded to the bar the
partner of the red-haired girl had his drink
and departed the red-haired girl strolled
across the room beseeching all and sundry
to dance she was out of luck till she
passed sam bellows who promptly stretched
out a long arm and seized her by the wrist

  lemme alone she squalled and jerked
free with a twist and a wrench

  bellows smiling wickedly slid from the
window sill and grabbed her again she
clawed at his eyes with her free hand and
spat like a cat

 lemme alone - yore soul she

yelled

  bellows still smiling threw up his right
hand to guard his eyes with an in-
credibly swift movement the girls head
shot forward and her white teeth closed
on his fingers she began to chew
savagely

  bellows instantly released her arm and
ground his hard knuckles into her cheek

  leggo he panted leggo

  her reply to that was to scratch his face
from temple to chin his fingers closed
on her throat he had ceased to smile
his teeth were bare to the gum his
expression was murderous

  then kansas casey in the lead seven
men flung themselves upon bellows and
two others grappled with the woman

  stop it bawled windy taylor as with
thumb and second finger he strove to force
apart her jaws after the fashion of one
persuading a stubborn horse to take the bit

  the lady clung to bellows and closed
down like a bulldog a trickle of blood
dribbled from the corners of her mouth
she was not pretty to look upon

  the little group of struggling people
swayed and stamped and reeled to and fro
and banged against the wall windy did
not cease to pry and beseech the lady to
leggo but he could not break her grip
bellows with various men attached to his
arms and legs was helpless but he could
curse and he did-horribly

  the fiddler who had disappeared now
returned bearing a pepper-pot this article
of kitchen-ware he upended and violently
shook in front of the red-haired girls nose
she sneezed her jaws opened and the


adventure

men holding her bore her backward with a
rush the men fastened upon bellows
bore him as rapidly in the other direction

  pepper always fixes em observed the
fiddler and returned to his table and
climbed upon it to his chair

  the red-haired girl reaction setting in
sat down on the floor and sobbed stormily
she also sneezed at not infrequent intervals
for the fiddlers pepper had been finely
ground

  sam bellows released somewhat hastily
by caseys assistants stood in the doorway
blood oozed sluggishly down his well-
scratched face and dripped from his torn
fingers he had regained control of him-
self but his light eyes the pupils narrowed
to pin-points were deadly kansas casey
faced him hardily the deputy had not
drawn his gun but his right hand swung
close to the butt he placed no trust in
sam bellows despite the latters partial
disablement

  this will be about all said kansas
casey quietly drag it out o here
spose i dont feel like goin bellows
suggested with icy cahn

  i aint makin no threats-but youll go
just the same

  youve got the call bellows said with
a feline grin ill go-now but ill be
back i seem to have made a lot o friends
here tonight

  his light eyes picked out the faces of the
men who had been holding him

  the bridles off to you tomorrow but
you wont come in here again tonight
declared the deputy an id go a lil slow
if i was you-later

  you aint me said bellows shortly and
he wheeled and walked out into the night

chapter xvi

the branding

next days stage brought a letter for
miss blythe she showed it happily
to henderson in front of the blue pigeon
it was from the cashier of the first national
in piegan city and duly set forth that
three thousand dollars had been deposited
to miss blythes account

  thats fine said henderson it come
soonern i expected didja ask mike about
goin partners

  i did he said shore were going

to get a whole lot of new stock and make
the store bigger

  thats the stuff put a crimp in dolan
an calloway

  on the instant the girls expression
altered subtly a shiver of repugnance
made her eyelids flicker but it was not
hendersons words that affected her sam
bellows was coming down the street hen-
derson saw him too and began to speak of
a certain gray pony that he was positive
miss blythe would enjoy riding out of
his eye-corners he continued to watch
bellows he noted that the punchers
right hand was bandaged and that he wore
his six-shooter in a new left-handed holster
tied down on his left leg

  bellows smiled openly at miss blythe
as he passed because the scratches on
his face were deep and long it was an oddly
crooked smile over his shoulder he gave
henderson the feline grin he had bestowed
on kansas casey the evening before
miss blythe shivered again

  i-i guess ill go in she said a trifle
wanly

  henderson followed her into the blue
pigeon

  look here he ground out roughly
hes searin you again you just lemme
off that promise will yuh

  she shook her head

  no i wont he just makes me feel
shaky when he looks at me that way im
not scared truly im not-when youre
around

  she looked up at him with her great dark
eyes-eyes that were deep pools of mystery
her lips were parted ever so little hen-
derson caught his breath he had never
seen her look like this nor had he ever
felt like this at other times when in her
company he had experienced a certain
pleasant mental agitation but that sen-
sation was but a ripple to the wave of feeling
that engulfed him now he stared her
eyes held his unwaveringly he trembled
like an over-ridden horse there was in
his ears a buzzing astif countless bees he
tried to speak and couldnt he gulped
like a schoolboy and passed a shaking hand
across his forehead

  tha-thas fine he finally managed to
stammer out and incontinently lied to his
haven of refuge the log at the hotel corral

  whatsa matter with me he asked him-
self furiously i got lots o things to say
high pockets



to her an i cant say em last night i
could talk to her like a house afire this is
a helluva note

  mrs lainey busy in the hotel kitchen
wondered why he was making cigarets and
throwing them away unsmoked she de-
cided wise woman though she was that
henderson was drunk

  in the afternoon came the rainbow on
windigo and said that all things were ready
henderson listened to her words and smiled
the smile was not mirthful it was sar-
donic the rainbow narrowed her black
eyes and smiled back nor was her smile
pleasant one perceived the lurking
indian

  everythins fixed this end observed
henderson sing lueys kitchen door
at nine oclock will be about right

  it should said the rainbow

  instead of a glass i guess well make it
a bottle

  that will be better so long old-timer
see you later

  the rainbow whirled windigo and was
gone

at half-past nine oclock in
the evening henderson and chuck
morgan walked into the dance-hall
chuck morgan took position at the bar
near the door but henderson did not
he sat down across the room on a chair
facing the bar henderson had a bottle
with him at times he appeared to take
long and healthy pulls at that bottle it
was not manifest to the naked eye that
hendersons tongue corked the bottle every
time he tilted it

  the crowd in the dewdrop was not so
large as on the previous evening kansas
casey and a fair sprinkling of prominent
citizens were present together with several
riotous bar s punchers engaged in the
pleasing business of spending two months
pay but of those six gentlemen that had
assisted casey in the subduing of sam
bellows only one a quiet-eyed person
named kane was in attendance

  it may have been that the presence of
sam bellows himself had something to do
with their absence for sam was slouching
on a chair in a far corner from under-
neath his shading hat brim he was watching
the dancers his attitude and expression
betokened a lazy tranquility of matter and
mind now and then he smiled slightly

crookedly certainly one could not divine
his thoughts

  a dance ended and the couples paraded to
the bar it was the first occasion since the
arrival of henderson and chuck morgan
that all five of the dance-hall girls had
been at the bar at the same time hen-
derson glanced at chuck the latter
sauntered across the room and leaned
against the wall near henderson

  aw- exclaimed henderson drunk-

enly and dashed his bottle on the floor

  at the crash the folk drinking at the bar
turned their heads it was consistent then
henderson having seated himself with that
end in mind that the doorway should be
included in the scope of their vision

  the cork of the shattered bottle had not
ceased to roll when a man stepped in from
the outer dark and halted in the doorway
to all intents and purposes the man was
rufe thompson in the flesh from boots
to hat his clothing was rufe thompsons
he stood there thumbs hooked in his
belt silently regarding a stricken room-
ful

  the unfortunate snakebite was the first
to recover the use of his faculties-recovered
them only to lose them instantly after
uttering a terrifiic squawk of fright he
foamed at the mouth and fell down in a fit
the bartender dived under the bar the
fiddler jumped through a window taking
with him in his flight the sash thereof the
efficient chuck morgan hopped through
another window to head off the fiddler

  but no one paid any attention to these
four and their actions for one of the
brunettes her face gray-blue spotted with
red was out in the middle of the room
screaming like a lost soul

  go way she shrieked at the man in
the doorway whatcha hauntin me for
i didnt know he was gonna kill yuh i
swear i didnt i didnt know what was
gonna happen or id never helped gawd
gawd dont look at me that way i
cant stand it they made me do itl
they did they did lemme alone i tell
yuh i didnt know sam bellows was gonna
kill yuh

  the brunette gasped choked then flung
up her arms and crumpled to the floor in a
dead faint henderson who had been
moving unobtrusively in the direction of
bellows during the brunettes outburst
went after his gun and leaped forward


adventure

sam bellows likewise leaped-toward the
nearest window

  the dance-hall was of course in an
uproar the slow-witted folk collided with
and impeded their quick-thinking brothers
calloway tripping over a chair fell against
hendersons gun-hand and knocked the
upswinging six-shooter to the floor as
though this were not enough the blundering
calloway scrambling to regain his balance
drove the point of his shoulder into the pit
of hendersons stomach which stomach
was well-muscled but it gave under the
blow and the gun in hendersons waistband
promptly slid down inside his trousers and
jammed its barrel in his boot

  as yet not a shot had been fired and sam
bellows was astride a window sill he was
in a fair way to escape when the red-haired
girl swift to discern a heaven-sent oppor-
tunity for revenge hurled herself across the
intervening space and wound her arms
about his leg bellows snarling sought to
draw his six-shooter

  both hendersons guns were out of reach
but lie had one card left to play his right
hand flashed to the back of his neck there
was a twinkle of steel in the lamplight a
vicious whir in the smoky air and sam
bellows a nine-inch bowie pinning his left
hand to his thigh fell back into the room

  by the time henderson kansas casey
and the quiet-eyed citizen kane had
bandaged sam bellows chuck morgan
returned marching ahead of him the fiddler
and mr tom stute the latter his
broken arm still in a sling was attired
solely in a nightshirt

  caught stute slidin out to his corral
when i was goin after the fiddler ex-
plained chuck morgan

  i was feeling feverish averred mr
stute forcing a smile i guess i was a
little delirious perhaps whats all the
row about

  were gomia find out henderson told
him  j ust as soon as the lady on the floor
comes to were gonna shore find out

  mr stute found no comfort in the words
he was seen to lick his lips and nervously
rub one bare ankle against the other he
looked glumly at sam bellows

  the fiddler said nothing he was agi-
tatedly gnawing his nails and staring about
him with scared eyes in this he was at
one with many another in the dewdrop
dance-hall

  whu-wheres that ghost the fiddler
asked suddenly

  where is he demanded kansas casey
scrambling to his feet in the hurry of
the bustling moment he had forgotten the
apparition of rufe thompson so appar-
ently had henderson

  i dunno said henderson blankly
aint he here

  i-i seen him disappear right where he
was standin in the doorway quavered
dolan he went out like yuhd blow out
a candle

  he did huh snickered henderson
yuh got eyes like a eagle dolan

  i seen him insisted dolan i was
lookin right at him

  yore imagination is a bird grinned
henderson im tellin yuh- by gawd
wheres that barkeep

  henderson ran behind the bar the
bartender had vanished henderson ran
out into the street from afar off sounded
the faint tuck-a-lnck tuck-a-tuck of gallop-
ing horses the slurring drum dwindled
died out henderson reentered the dance-
hall

  guess the barkeeps sloped he said to
the multitude anybody gone for jake
rule he asked of kansas casey

  i sent dockery for him said kansas
say henderson who was that-that
ghost

  yeah who was he others wished to
know gazing fearfully the while at the
doorway

  plenty o time for explanation later
replied henderson theys no hurry
a-tall the ladys cornin to he added
glancing down at the prostrate brunette

  the brunette recovered consciousness
gaspingly

  oh she whispered when she could
speak the ghost the ghost

  shore the ghost said henderson help-
fully happened in quite handy didnt
he can yuh sit up

  without waiting for a reply he slipped
his hands beneath her armpits lifted her
gently and slid her on a chair

     entered then jake rule and
 r the marshal and pushed their way
 through the crowd

  whats up asked jake

  the ladys gonna tell us henderson
said softly
high pockets



  but the lady was not going to do anything
of the kind she said so profanely

  mightaswell warned henderson you
told quite a lot when-the ghost came in
the brunette shuddered but remained
silent

  all right henderson said ill just
tell yuh jake what ive found out about
two months ago rufe thompson was mur-
dered an robbed here in farewell

  i didnt know he was robbed cut in
jake rule

  he was all right he was carryin
three thousand dollars in a belt

  then thats why his shirt was pulled up
out o his pants exclaimed kansas casey

  i expect said henderson i come up

  oh the sheriffs eyes rounded saucer-

woman tom burned it

  thanks bill derr said dryly rti kind
o hoped yuh wouldnt swallow my lil lie

  mr stute a pale body of a man shrank
into himself derr turned to the brunette

  listen here weve got bellows an
tom stute already an the barkeep an the
fiddler are both under suspicion who else
was in this speak up dont be afraid
turn states evidence an save yore neck
the brunette held down in her chair by
two men began to rave

  does that states evidence go for me
the fiddler asked swiftly

  derr nodded coldly the fiddler took a
long breath

  tom stute longhorn an lamp black
planned it they-

  kansas interrupted jake rule spose
you sift over to the happy heart an glom
on to lamp black go on he added to
the fiddler

  the barkeep an me heard em ribbin
up the dead an-an-thats how we come
to know about it

  how much djuh get for keepin yore
mouths shut flashed derr

  only a hundred apiece

  yore shore cheap gon

  they didnt wanna do the job them-
selves so they picked sam bellows hed
come in after dark put his hoss in stutes
corral an gone to sleep in daisys room
the fiddler jerked his thumb at the hys-
terical brunette so yuh see nobody
ceptin us six knowed anythin about
bellows an it looked easy daisy she
tolled thompson out back o the stage
corrals an bellows knifed him an pulled
his freight instanter with his share o the

opinion

  i appoint every man here a deputy
ceptin the prisoners shouted the sheriff
kane you an morgan guard em the
rest o yuh get yore hosses were a-goin
after that barkeep

  i dont hardly think its necessary
interposed henderson i didnt tell yuh
that i heard three-four hosses punchin the
breeze when i went outside after the
barkeep i guess the jigger is bein at-
tended to here comes kansas

  the deputy was the leader of a large dele-
gation from the happy heart of which dele-
gation the desired lamp black was not one
wheres lamp queried the sheriff
hes back there replied kansas casey
he went after his gun when i throwed
down on him i guess he must a sus-
picioned somethin

  hes saved us trouble said the sheriff
kansas take one o the boys an go out to
the  an watch simms till hes able to
ride whos this why-by gawd

  the question and expletive were called
forth by the precipitate entry of the dew-
drop barkeeper and rufe thompsons ghost
the ghost was prodding forward the bar-
keeper with the muzzle of a six-shooter
following the two men were the rainbow
and willies old-brother-in-law

  gon - yuh snarled the ghost

whatcha waitin for


adventure

  he gripped the bartender by the collar
and flung him sprawling at the sheriffs feet

  dunno whether hes wanted or not
went on the ghost but i seen him slide
out through a side window while i was
standin in the doorway so me an willies
old-brother-in-law an his niece here took
out after him on suspicion whatcha find
out bill is he wanted

  plenty an he is replied derr kan-
sas casey downed one a while ago theys
another sick abed-out at the  an we got
the rest

  he indicated bandaged bellows and the
others with a sweep of his hand the
ghost stared at them with smoldering eyes
the spectators stared at the ghost the
latter was obviously a flesh and blood
person but he was an exact replica in
features body carriage and voice of the
dead rufe thompson

  i shore wish the sheriff wasnt here
said the newcomer simply

  say stranger who are you demanded
the sheriff

  im rufe thompsons brother sile
was the answer i guess yuh didnt know
we was twins didja

bill derr chuck morgan and
thompson were the sole occupants
of the many-bedded room in the
hotel that night

  yuh done well bill observed sile
thompson pulling off a boot yuh
gotem quickern i thought yuh would
when djuh begin to suspect em

  i had a hunch from the start that tom
stute an simms was in it but i didnt know

for shore an-

  so thats why yonly nicked em that-
away cried chuck bouncing upright on
his cot

  shore thats why henderson said
calmly

  youre got yore nerve

  i was scared to death alia time bet
i lost me a years growth it was mostly
luck anyway i never expected no such
haul as we got tonight for my lil surprise
i only aimed to scare one o the women into
talkin some

  didncha suspect bellows at first
asked thompson

  not when i sent the rainbow an her
uncle after yuh i didnt i didnt see him
till right before then anyhow but when

i got to marysville-an that was more
luck cause i only went there on business
for a friend-i heard dunlavy the express
agent tell the barkeep at the sunrise that
they was a saddle bridle spurs an chaps
from blaziers at pueblo come for sam
bellows

  yuh know yuh can buy saddles up to
sixty-eighty dollars in marysville so i
knowed this saddle must be somethin
fancy-bridle spurs an chaps likewise
i was wonderin where sam got all his
money i asked round an i heard hed
dropped moren four hundred playin the
wheel in marysville ten months wages
right there an from all i could learn
bellows aint the savin kind then it
come to me that bellows was sort o brutal
with women hosses an men

  an the man that killed rufe was a
shore-nough brute put in sile thompson
in a low voice was that it

  it gave me the start of an idea i asked
some more an i found out bellows drifted
into marysville two days after the murder
i went to the  an they told me the date
when bellows left there which date was
the mornin o the day rufe was killed so
i began to have more hopes than ever o
what would happen when youd step into
the doorway o the dewdrop

  i shore knowed it would work out when
i got yore letter i dunno why i never

thought o the thing it was so -

simple say that injun an his niece are
shore good people an sly-bill we didnt
see nobody but ourselves from the time
we left the slash f till sing luey opened
the back door o the canton

  i was figurin thats how it would be
bill derr said sleepily

  in the morning derr watching his oppor-
tunity walked into the canton a few
minutes after the departure of the last
breakfaster

  yuhve heard how it turned out he
said to sing luey

  it - turned out remarkably well
nodded sing luey his oriental features
inscrutable as ever

  yuh shore helped me out- derr began
awkwardly

  sing luey held up a deprecating hand

  i am paid he said you have rid me
of two enemies stute and simms once did
me an injury they thought it did not
matter that i did not matter i waited
high pockets



i could afford to wait i knew my time
would come it did you saw

  you suspected them two from the
beginnin huh

  i did not suspect i knew but i had
no proof you came you with my poor
help obtained those proofs ah i am
grateful i will show you

 he whipped from beneath his em-
broidered silk over-shirt a small figurine
of carved jade squat hideously ugly the
image sat upon sing lueys yellow palm and
leered greenly at bill derr

  this continued the celestial is-
is-i can not tell you what it is in your
language but it is very old it is a
thousand years older than kong-fou-
tse and he died nearly five hundred years
before your god was born it brings good
luck to whomsoever receives it as a gift
to whomsoever steals it from the person
to whom it has been given it brings evil
and much sorrow it was given to me a
gift i give it to you a gift take it
he held it out bill derr making
nothing at all of sing lueys words thanked
the chinaman and thrust the figurine into
the breast pocket of his shirt where it
cuddled his tobacco bag on one side and a
pencil stub on the other

  shake said derr extending his hand
yore all right sing luey any time yuh
want a favor done an i can do it ill take
it kindly if yuhll call on me yuh know
where i live just lemme know thats all
ill remember smiled sing luey and
shook hands with occidental firmness of
grip

  so long said bill derr and departed
in the street he met sile thompson
where you been asked sile i been
chasin yuh all over got a proposition
bill i was gonna tell yuh last night but
you was too sleepy i got a chance to buy
the slash f wanna come in with me

  i aint got the money

rest o yore share out of the profits in five

years well be all square even-steven say
yes cowboy say yes

  gimme a chance shut up an i will
ill beller it plumb in yore ear the
slash f thats shore luck

  luck he remembered the words of
sing luey his hand flew to his breast
pocket through the thickness of flannel
his fingers pinched the jade figurine leav-
ing sile thompson all standing he hurried
off in the direction of the blue pigeon

  hey where yuh goin cried sile
thompson

  the retreating henderson hunched a
shoulder by way of reply and continued on
his way his lips moved silently

  im gonna crowd that luck he was
saying to himself im shore gonna
crowd that luck for all its worth

  sile thompson watched his friend enter
the blue pigeon store

  id shore admire to know whats eatin
bill he muttered and scratched a puzzled
head guess maybe ill go see

  at the door of the blue pigeon he met
mike flynn and chuck morgan coming
out mike closed the door softly sat
down firmly on the sill and planted a wide
back against the door chuck morgan
teetered on his heels and grinned idiotically

  say i was goin in there sile thomp-
son said wrathfully

  you was but you aint chuckled mike
  what the-

  come away where its cool thompson
urged the grinning morgan les go have
a drink a lot o drinks

  i dont want no drink i wanna see
bill whatsa matter with you fellers

  shore we are an bills crazy too all
same fox cmon

  sile thompson went he had to

  later when he came to see matters and
individuals in their proper light and place
he quite agreed with chuck morgan that
bill derr was as mad as that notably intelli-
gent animal the gray fox of the waste
places
the frayed strand

  by

roy p churchill

author of ojf the course arabetc

one thing which the men of the
u s s rainbow respected in
boatswains mate dick reason-
er was that he always stood to
an issue face to face he might lay un-
cannily clever plans to make things come
out right and dodge plain trouble when
there was just as good a way free from it
but when a thing was squarely up to him
he did not squirm and side-step to save his
face but had it out win or lose right
there

  it was wednesday afternoon rope
yarn sunday and the rainbows crew had
their kits and ditty-boxes strewn about the
forecastle while they sewed wrote letters
and gossiped a homey peaceful scene
and into it dick reasoner fitted perfectly
he sat on a sea-chest with his back to a
wire deck-locker full of scrubbers squilgees
swabs and paint rags and read a book
smiling sometimes as if it was a funny story
and again scowling intently as if it might be
a drill manual

  but the book was neither it was a
dictionary and its well-thumbed pages had
earned for dick reasoner the nickname
dictionary dick and the right from his
shipmates to expect that he would help
them out of their troubles

  today reasoner smiled little he
searched the book for help in a difficult
problem and presently clay mccune came
and sat beside him bringing the matter to a
point reasoner slipped the little book



into his blouse compared to mccune he
was solid steady-eyed and bulwarklike and
his smile was an invitation to the other man
to unload

  clay mccune was almost as tall as
reasoner but slighter in build with slim
sinewy hands and brilliantly fascinating
dark eyes which had in them also a keen
restlessness as if his soul walked back and
forth behind them as a caged beast behind
bars

  mccune took a hurried look about him
and lowered his voice

  im going to jump he said with a bare
shade of defiance which was not necessary
with reasoner

  ive seen it coming since we dropped
anchor said reasoner

  then he swept his arm out toward the
rim of the crescent bay where port an-
tonio lay tucked in at the foot of the moun-
tains

   it is this he asked

  mccune nodded and without speaking
the two looked shoreward across the bay
between the shimmering blue water with
its strip of white beach and the towering
bulk of santa inez mountain with its lights
and shadows of tropic green the town was
a bright splash of color with its red roofs
and its gay flags brilliant in the sunlight
truly it was a port of romance and to this
place chance had brought clay mccune
and his trouble-begetting rashness when
the boy needed cool sober remolding
the frayed strand



something to curb the wanderlust too high-
pitched in this soul

   i thought id tell you mccune broke
the silence apologetically its due you
youve tried hard but this place was made
for me the call is so strong it breaks
down everything else a canoe from shore
is coming out to get me

  dick reasoner did not argue mccune
had made his choice against his sworn word
against allegiance to his country against the
confidence of his friends who had plead that
he be given one more chance so reasoner
said nothing true he could have him put
in the brig and held him by force but this
was not reasoners way if he had failed
with mccune having the man in the brig
would not turn the defeat into victory

   i dont want you to feel bad mccune
continued youve done all you could
old hippoleferez is going to hide me until the
ship sails and then make me captain of his
machine-gun company im telling you all
about it because i know you wont snitch
mccunes eyes sparkled and he looked
steadily at reasoner for the moment his
restlessness had given way to purpose
reasoner smiled enigmatically

   i hope it turns out all right clay but
old ferez will do to watch

  what do you mean he cant afford
to double-cross me

  you cant tell just look out boy
theres a word in the book that mighty few
spiggoties know anything about far as
that goes a lot of us miss its real meaning
its loyalty notice how it sounds warm
and comforting and smooth but it has
force in it too just as if it was a strap-
ping six-footer leading along little sister by
the hand

   im sick of lectures dick i know what
youre driving at and who youre aiming at
what if the outfit did take me back and
give me another chance after id had a
dozen what if the judge did say that
the navy was no place for bad characters
and put it up to the commandant whether to
send me back or to send me up for two
years

  i know all about how the commandant
put it up to the captain and the captain
put it up to you and what a bunch of young
fellows youve shoved over on the right side
when they started to lean but it wont do
with me im sorry dick i like you and
i like the outfit and i honestly thought i

might make it if i had another trial but
whats the use im not built for steady
going

   i didnt mean to lecture said reasoner
and i want no praise all ive done is to
put the things before you maybe youll
hit the right course some day this may
be the one i hope so clay but i dont
trust port antonio shes a witch and a
siren she had a rainbow over her like a
crown this morning and i can feel myself
swing out toward her to the end of the an-
chor chain thats what you need clay
an anchor something to swing to thats
what you lack get you one clay

  the young man stretched out his arms
toward the city

   its over there dick i feel it

  reasoner shook his head in warning

  not old ferez and his machine-gun
captaincy not that slim wild half-white
dancer at the independencia nor the indo-
lent luxury of the long soft days theyll
pass just as the other bright things that you
have tried to tie to have passed its
something inside ive tried hard to find
it for you and have failed but before you
go im offering you the word from the
little book-the one i told you about
loyalty if you could shackle to that
somehow youd be safe anywhere

  dick reasoner was nearer to winning
clay mccune at that moment than at any
other time impulsively mccune turned

   ill stay then dick he cried

  reasoner was not elated

  think it over he advised

  he jnew too well mccunes habit of
good resolves quickly broken then the
two sat silently again looking out to sea
and around the trim white deck with its
contented groups at their homely tasks
among the black gun-muzzles and after a
time mccunes eyes turned again toward
the city and he decided as reasoner knew
he would

   im going dick all this stuff has lost
out with me id be booze-fighting liberty-
breaking trouble-making again in no time
im not really deserting im trying to keep
out of trouble maybe that anchor you
have been talking about is over there

  look for it clay said reasoner and
the two parted

  the next morning clay mccune did not
answer to muster and ten days later he was
posted as a deserter


adventure

wide

i between being a guest at port
antonio and being a resident clay
mccune soon found there was a
ifference the rainbow had gone
and no longer did he hide himself at senor
ferezs inland plantation while the marines
came ashore -and went through the usual
haunts of sailors to find him he was
dressed now in the uniform of a captain
and on fete days was bedecked in much gold
lace and a sword which tripped him

  but no longer was he a guest port
arftonio threw back the veil so that he
could see beneath the rice powder and the
gaiety and the feasting and he found her
more than a witch and a siren she was
also a cat with sharp claws in her velvet
pads he found himself only the present
favorite of vesta the dancing girl at the
independencia the last of a dozen captains
of the machine-gun company one of the
citys small group of aliens a paid mer-
cenary

  yet in clay mccune there was a quality
which those before him had not had true
his skin was white but his heart was restless
impulsive unstable which gave him a soul
kinship with those among whom he lived

  for all that mccune felt himself apart
in fact drew himself apart after the manner
of all men whose skin is white and in the
councils where hippole ferez dictated and
intrigued and schemed to hold his place
mccune had no part but did his work as
he was told

  almost senor el capitan you are one
of us ferez had praised him when the
company had come back from the prompt
quelling of an incipient revolution and now
something bigger was on

  mccune felt it but could not place it
deference itself was the dictator and suave
and polite his satellites but it was through
the girl at the independencia that he found
out and that almost by accident

  they were sitting in the little restaurant
next to the theater whose patio overlooked
the bay

  heres to he whom the bull trusts she
said holding up the yellow wine to the moon
before she brought it to her lips

  bull questioned mccune the words
rousing him from the dreamy seductiveness
of port antonio at night which had not yet
lost its charm

  senor ferez he is the bull with the
people it is his name

  so you think he trusts me

  si senor why not do you not go soon
on a mission of importance those who
kill for senor ferez he trusts

  mccune feigned indifference

  where do you get this idle gossip he
bantered you know nothing

  piqued the dancing girl drained her glass
and turned on him half-angrily she
would show this americano just how deep
she was in her countrys schemes

  listen she said lowering her voice
does not estreda yet live unconquered at
la combra is he not rich has not the
ship of war americano gone to a safe
distance

  mccune was startled and misunder-
standing his emotion the girl continued-

  did the americano think that senor
ferez the bull brought him to dress and
to play

  the words stung mccune but he kept his
temper and answered evenly

  all right vesta my girl im sick of in-
action anyhow

  there was a note of exultation in his
voice which surprised the dancer it was
this quality of unexpectedness in him which
kept her wondering almost he was one of
them as ferez had said

  i hope then she changed instantly
that ferez makes you a general and that
you come back to me safely you are to
head the expedition my americano
mccune did not doubt the girls story
for he knew a little of the complete dominion
over the island which ferez coveted and of
the defiance of a smaller neighbor who had
already beaten off an ill-timed invasion
now mccune knew why ammunition for
target practise had been plentiful drills
multiplied and the picked men placed in
the machine-gun company with two modern
guns

  in the few days that followed ferezs veri-
fication of the dancing girls story mccune
became better acquainted with his chief
they were together a great deal ferez
directing driving scheming and mccune
began to know why his people called him
affectionately and half-fearfully the bull
a week later they brought their little army
safely over the mountain trails each man
well-fed well-armed and confident to a
smaller crescent bay and the town of
la combra

  the attack was less of a surprise than
the frayed strand



ferez had hoped at the edge of the town
they met scouting parties and sentries
defeated them with small loss and then
fighting from house to house drove estreda
and a remnant of his followers to the gov-
ernment house in the plaza here the
defenders made their prepared stand and
three desperate charges had failed to dis-
lodge them nightfall found the scattered
inhabitants gaining confidence coming back
to their houses and some bolder spirits
creeping in to join estreda with another
gun or another small store of food and
ammunition

  the last time for three days we did not
come so far ferez told his leaders con-
fidently tomorrow we will take the place
by storm

  clay mccune was happy the day had
been full of thrills with its quick changes of
fortune and ferez had praised the work of
the deadly machine-guns more than once
the two made a tour of the camp inspect-
ing the sentries strung around the hostile
buildings in the center of the plaza

  today is proof we made no mistake in
our captain the americano said ferez
when we get back the captain will find he
had made no mistake in us he shall have
more than the prize he has already taken

  at daylight the wily estreda sent a mes-
senger with a flag of truce warfare still
held to its historic code in antonio es-
treda warned that he would resist to the
last that his store of food and ammunition
was ample and that reinforcements were on
the way

  only the beaten talk thus replied
ferez and sent his men to the attack with
new vigor from house to house and wall
to wall they closed in on estredas strong-
hold making short rushes from cover to
cover

  estredas thick brick building was in the
center of a walled-in court pierced with
loopholes it was against this outer wall
that ferez had thrown his men in the pre-
ceding attacks and against which he had
failed in the first invasion now clay
mccune swept the loopholes on the wall
clear with the machine-guns so that ferezs
men climbed up and chased the defenders in
a rout to the house itself

  through the wall a wide gate led down an
avenue of palms to the house half-way
in was a fountain around which the walk
and the palm border curved gracefully this

walk and fountain were the work of estredas
predecessor and also the means of his down-
fall for estreda had pointed out the luxury
to the great common people slipped into
power on account of it and became in turn
the possessor of its splendor

  but an election impended and patriotic-
ally he had dried up the fountain and let
grass grow between the bricks of the pave-
ment so that what once had been his
secret pride was now his advertisement of
economy and by the queer fortunes of war
might become his undoing

  still protected by the machine-guns
ferezs soldiers broke open the huge iron
gate and crept to the fountain inside it on
the dried mud with its wisps of dead ferns
and water lilies they were safe from rifie-
fire from the house and a group of picked
men gathered for another dash forward
while they answered the shots from the
windows of the house

  ferez and mccune stood safely in an
angle of the wall by the gate

  we could wheel them inside said
mccune of the guns a little to one side
so that the palms would not interfere then
keep the windows clear while the rush was
made with a beam to break in the door
the place will be ours in ten minutes that
fountain gives us a ready-made bullet-proof
dug-out

  ferez beamed his captain was truly a
rich find step by step he had cleared the
way with the guns and they had not
jammed once there seemed an uncanny
brotherhood between their death-dealing
black muzzles with their complicated sen-
sitive interiors and this americano in
consequence of it his loss had been only
enough to make his men bold eager and to
add to their spirits

  it is well senor said ferez i will
give the order to get the beam ready and
fill estredas fountain to the brim with my
best fighting men and you my captain be
careful for after all there must be a leader
and one such is worth a fountain full of the
bravest

a messenger stopped the prep-
aration for so urgent was his news
that ferez and mccune ran across
the bullet-swept plaza to the roof of a house
on its border where protected by a facade
from the shots behind them they could see
the harbor


adventure

  its the rainbow exclaimed mccune
hardly believing that it could be true yet
while they looked the american warship
came to a stop the anchor chain went out
with a rumble as boat booms were rigged
out and gangways dropped in place in true
man-o-war style the rainbows captain
had been on this station too long not to
know the value of the unexpected he
had implied that the rainbow was going to
her base and then run back to see how his
charges were behaving

  what is the custom demanded ferez
furious at the interruption with victory in
sight what will be done

  an hour later he could have had the
captain ashore for dinner and all would
have been well but what now

  quick senor mccune he urged
  mccune shook his head

  im afraid its all off i have seen them
do this too often theyll come ashore
estreda will tell them all about it and we
will either have to go home in peace or be
chased away by the rainbows guns

  but we have the victory argued
ferez you say so yourself estreda is
beaten why is it they should take sides
with him against me instead of me against
him im the stronger is it not so
hard luck said mccune but the
trouble is that we recognize the ins
against the outs every time

  we questioned ferez

  a little sadly mccune pointed to the
gray ship

  i beg pardon senor they there will
be an officer with a police guard at first and
following that a landing party and heavy
guns if both sides are not good id call
the men and get safely out of the way with
the machine-guns of course we have lost
mighty few as it is and when the rainbow
does get away-she wont stay long if all
is quiet-well slip down here again and do
the trick

  for mccune the joy had gone out of the
adventure he only wanted to get away
now safe from recognition ferez turned to
him with a well-feigned air of resignation

  it is fate senor he shrugged i will
attend to everything you had best get
away first take two men as a guard on
the road outside the city i will join you
as you say perhaps another time we will be
more successful

  as mccune slipped from the roof the boat

from the rainbow came alongside the boat-
landing and discharged an officer and ten
sailors mccunes one idea as he dodged
along from building to building out of sight
of estredas marksmen was not to be seen
by his comrades he had not even both-
ered to take the guards that ferez had
suggested then he slowed down stopped
and before he had gone half a dozen blocks
he was creeping back stealthily without
knowing the exact reason unless as always
he was acting on impulse and there had
been a glint in the back of senor ferezs eye
as he so easily gave up a victory almost won

  or it might have been that he came back
to see his comrades again all in white with
their jaunty hand-sewed hats loose blouses
and flaring trousers white too of skin
and clean all through how long had it
been since he had seen ten men all white
together whatever his motive it found
him at last on a roof overlooking the plaza
and this is what he saw

  first senor ferez had not withdrawn his
men and the plaza was strangely ominous-
ly silent only an occasional shot from a
roof from a doorway from the fountain in
the courtyard kept estredas men in their
places and they had almost ceased to
answer since help was at hand for estreda
knew the rule that the ins should be
protected and wondered a little at ferezs
stupidity in not getting his men away while
he could

  mccune was puzzled at first but from his
vantage-point he could see every detail
ferez had withdrawn his men from the
shoreward side of the plaza and wall the
two macliine-guns were hidden in a flaring
angle beside the gate this left the street
up which the sailors marched clear it had
the appearance of being deserted and harm-
less

  close against the courtyard wall came the
landing-party from the rainbow ensign
jennings was two paces ahead of the little
column of twos headed by dick reasoner
even at that distance mccune recognized
reasoners breadth of shoulder and his half-
slouching yet springy step and his whole
appearance of latent power and strength
held in reserve his heart moved out
toward this man he was glad to see him
again dictionary dick at least had been
patient and kind and long-suffering

  so taken was mccune with this that the
column was a third of the way down the
the frayed strand



wall toward the gate before the full mean-
ing of ferezs trickery came to him for
inside the courtyard in the abandoned foun-
tainferez had made a new disposition of his
forces of the twenty men who were
sheltered there only two had their rifles
pointed at estredas house the others
faced the wide gate rifles laid along the edge
of the cracked cement also across the
courtyard outside the wall ladders had been
placed and more rifles pointed from the
wrong side of the loopholes toward the
gate entrance

  ferez had not meant to give up after all
since the american ship had come unex-
pectedly it should help instead of hindering
his plans at least in this way there was a
bare chance better than ignominiously ac-
cepting defeat the plan was very simple
when the sailors came from behind the
shelter of the wall and into the gateway he
would open fire on them from the fountain
and from the wall almost behind estredas
house there were eleven and some one or
two perhaps would escape to the ship with
the story that the house in the plaza had
fired on them

  in the meantime ferez would withdraw
his men to the flanking houses outside the
wall still keeping estredas men at bay
inside the courtyard then on them would
fall the wrath of the ships guns and es-
tredas power would be wiped out forever
yes it was a good plan ferez chuckled
over it and on the opposite wall with his
sharpshooters waited to give the signal to
the picked men in the fountain

  clay mccune had no struggle with him-
self as to what he should do no false idea
of loyalty to his master bull ferez he
saw only that his shipmates white men
like himself his friend dick reasoner were
about to go up against a deadly piece of
native trickery he ran to the rear of the
low house and slid feet first to the ground
dodged around the buildings into the street
and plunged madly forward across the plaza
toward the advancing sailors he ran with
both hands up shouting stop and
spoiled utterly ferezs chance of surprise

  kill him ordered the dictator and
gave the signal to fire

  bullets thudded into the dust glanced
from the scattered paving blocks and
slipped by overhead almost silently with
their cold breath of death but at this un-
expected appearance of the gringo gone

amuck ferezs men fired uncertainly and
mccune made the shelter of the wall un-
hurt and jumped across the deadly gate en-
trance in time to be recognized and his
warning understood

  but bull ferez was not one to give up
easily his hand had been forced but he
meant to play it out there was still left a
good opportunity to make an attack on the
sailors and have it credited to estreda if
only mccune were killed and on this
chance he signaled his picked men in the
bowl of the fountain to charge ignoring
the fact that estreda might open fire at
their backs they obeyed their chief prompt-
ly ran down the palm-bordered walk and
burst from the gate firing as they came

  instead of a surprised uncertain group
in close order which ferez had counted on
routing in a swift attack the native soldiers
met prepared resistance for mccune had
seen them coming as he crossed the gate
and flat on their faces deployed to the best
advantage the sailors poured in a searching
volley at close range which sent the soldiers
hurrying back to the gates ornamental
approaches and what shelter they could
find for sniping

  ferez stormed impotently first at the
failure of his plan and then at his own men
as group after group lying quiescent in the
surrounding buildings according to orders
joined the fight against the sailors to
fight gringoes especially when they were
outnumbered was a chance in a lifetime
and they were rapidly getting out of hand

  there are too many for us said en-
sign jennings weli get out of this
fall back and take advantage of all cover
until we can find a better place to hold
them

  dodging swiftly across the plaza stop-
ping to fire from tree trunks and door-
ways the sailors made their way to the
mouth of the street which led to the beach
carrying their wounded with them

  well signal for help from here decided
ensign jennings johnson is bad hit and
it hurts him to be carried without a
stretcher

  but already the landing-party in force
was under way the rainbows captain
had heard the outburst of firing and knew
the country too well to take a chance the
sight of the crowded boats speeding to the
rescue and the toll which the sailors rifles
had taken brought ferezs men to their


adventure

senses hastily he collected them cursing
his officers threatening to shoot any man
who disobeyed and by the time the landing-
party had climbed the hilly street to the
small detail entrenched and ready even the
sniping had ceased and ferezs whole ex-
pedition with even his wounded and dead
was on its way back over the mountain to its
own city

  estreda sent down his white flag was
voluble in his explanations and begged for
protection from the bandit of the north
so evident was the truth of his story
coupled with mccunes evidence that the
captain granted his plea for recognition as a
permanent in which had been denied
before and after a weeks inspection and
the cleaning up of several reform measures
the rainbow sailed away leaving the es-
timable seiior estreda happy and estab-
lished safe from marauding neighbors and
assured of reelection if the machinery which
so far had never failed continued to work

      the manner of mccunes coming
pgpl back aboard the rainbow elevated
him far above an ordinary deserter
and a scuttle-butt rumor got about that his
punishment was to be light so far he had
taken his place in his old division and swung
his hammock in his old billet in due
course of time preferably when officers
from another ship could take part there
would be a court-martial there was
method in this for the captain wanted to see
how mccune would knuckle down to work
after his experience ashore

  mccunes making good announced
slim higgins hes settling down like
a fellow whose chief sport was collecting
hash marks

  dick reasoner agreed heartily too
heartily and slim caught the false note

  youre not sure

  nothings sure said reasoner but
why poke into things with the sharp end
of a stick hes doing all right now lets
help him

  reasoner wouldnt admit even to his
friend slim higgins that there was the
shadow of a doubt in his mind lest in some
way it might throw a straw in the path of
clay mccune but reasoner couldnt help
remembering that mccune had come back
from each of his exploits with the same
chastened spirit the same earnest taking
up of the ships routine the same pledges to

stick in his words and in his work and each
time there had crept in finally the old un-
rest the old rebellion which led him in the
end thrill-questing to disaster

  to reasoner clay mccune had not
made a deciding choice when he slid from
the roof and ran across the plaza under fire
to save the landing-party from slaughter
his choice had been one that few men could
refuse since ferez had tricked him and
men of his own blood were in danger of
death reasoner took it as a good and
hopeful omen in the mans character but
not as conclusive evidence

  the week in the harbor at la combra
was followed by a week at sea the rain-
bows captain had a habit of running away
now and then to deep open water to clear
his brain and that of his crew of the islands
witchery of indolent carelessness its cease-
less fermenting of selfish interests these
days at sea were filled to the brim with drills
with target-practise with exacting routine
but men and officers came back to theii
duties with new snap and decision to apply
to their work with a wider perspective be-
sides keeping the natives guessing which
port would receive the next call

  in that week clay mccunes presence
aboard the rainbow became a matter of
course he was fitted again to the ma-
chine lost the savor of romance with which
his shipmates had clothed his desertion and
in consequence suffered a return of his old
restlessness

  then as before the rainbow dropped
anchor in port antonio for two days the
captain had impressed on ferez the fact
that estradas territory was tabu it was
night of the second day-soft warm en-
chanting-and reasoner and mccune sat
on the sea-chest with the old problem still
unsolved

  they wont let me go ashore com-
plained mccune

  first-class men for daylight liberty
only said reasoner not even second-
class whatd you expect with a court
martial hanging over you

  mccune took the rebuke silently but
after a moment spoke again

  this grind is getting me dick a week
of it seems like a year and i thought that
maybe if theyd let me go ashore-

  they wont interrupted reasoner

  i know it dick but whats to keep me
from slipping ashore some night this night
the frayed strand



if i like and seeing the old haunts again
the girl sent for me you know it would
help me to win out i can get a boat easily
give myself several hours ashore and be
back a little after midnight

  dont do it cautioned reasoner
knowing as he spoke that mccune would
go that very night

  ill have to taper off argued mccune
i cant stop quick like this this day-by-
day sameness is torture i can take up the
fight better if i break away

  no said reasoner firmly you dont
pour oil on fire to put it out nor starve any-
thing to death by feeding it the trouble
is clay you havent changed inside you
dont love the solid old service dont talk
to me about another fling helping you to win
out and fight better for youre not wanting
to settle down you dont want to give
up

  i guess youre right said mccune
smiling soberly but youre a good old
scout dick and i like you best when you
argue i was cut off another pattern and
cant be changed just as you say im
going on this way to the end because i like
it best i might as well be frank with you
and not try to hedge but sometimes a few
times-tonight is one-you make me wish
that i was a little more like you

  dick reasoner left him pacing back and
forth across the forecastle and a little later
from the bow came a soft call and an
answer from the still water alongside
mccune slipped down the anchor chain to a
waiting boat

  reasoner might have argued with him at
length preached about duty and loyalty
called a marine sentry and had him locked
up but reasoner knew it would do no good
for none of these things would change clay
mccune and with a feeling of helplessness
and failure reasoner began also to pace the
deck

  vesta the dancing girl at the indepen-
dencia stopped her sensuous whirl the
musicians missed a beat and the audience
turned in their chairs to look as clay
mccune walked down the theaters center
aisle and took a seat well forward he had
changed clothes as he came ashore in the
native boat and was dressed in the uniform
of a captain of the machine-gun company
with its resplendent many-colored trim-
mings

  as mccune took his seat amid the excited

whisperings of an audience impressed with
his bravado two men of ferezs body-guard
seated near the door behind him slipped
unobtrusively out their very stealthiness
making it plain that they sought their
master but unmolested mccune sat
through the program and sent a note to the
dancing girl then stood in the center of an
admiring group as the audience filed out
staring for this was the man-the wild
americano-who had defied bull ferez and
cost the dictator a rich province

  bright-eyed with excitement vesta joined
him and the two went to the restaurant ad-
joining and into the patio which overlooked
the sea

  you were foolish to come so openly
said the girl tremulous with admiration
and mccune caught her hand reassuringly

  what is there to fear little one you
will notice that the sword which used to trip
me is gone and i have in its place this a
gift from senor ferez he took out and
placed on the table a heavy automatic pistol
we will have our wine ferez must get
word must send picked men to make the
arrest and by that time we will be gone
let us hurry then pleaded vesta
no said mccune athrill with the
danger

  the pistol in easy reach gave him con-
fidence he would play out this little fillip
as dramatically as he had begun it

  they had the patio to themselves and
sat facing the door into the restaurant
well-shaded electric globes lighted the place
a nervous waiter came in to serve them and
spilled the wine as he poured it vesta
questioned him his answers were vague
and his eyes furtive he seemed on the
point of flight at each sound from the
restaurant

  i am afraid whispered the girl when
the waiter left them one may be brave
yes but the bull has many to kill for him
well sit here said mccune stubborn-
ly and finish our drink i dont propose
to be stampeded

  no said vesta but my americano is
in danger i feel it let us go now before
it is too late

  mccune refused and finished his wine
the restaurant became suddenly strangely
silent the girl clutched his arm

  they are coming she breathed and
mccune pushed her behind him as he rose
and faced the door pistol ready


adventure

 clay mccune knew well the man who
stood in the entrance he was small of
stature but thick and muscular his wide
evil face with its sparse-haired drooping
mustache and spreading pockmarked nose
was lighted by shrewd cruel eyes which
missed no detail of the situation he
bowed low as he came through the door
and his hands came forward innocently
mccunes heavy automatic covered him
steadily and it was to this that he gave
obeisance rather than to the man or the
girl for this was hippole ferezs prize
killer and assassin gutierrez the butcher

  mccune motioned with his free hand to
the table before him

  your gun he ordered crisply and
gutierrez laid it down obediently

  he knew that the sailor could shoot and
besides he had other plans

  may i sit down senor he asked as
mccune took up the extra revolver

 what do i care answered mccune
contemptuously you might tell my friend
ferez to come himself next time

  gutierrez sat down at a table in the cor-
ner mccune and the girl started toward
the door the sailor kept one of the re-
volvers pointed at the killer and divided
his attention between him and the entrance
the comer where gutierrez sat was dark
he pressed with his foot a small knob on the
floor a bell whirred in the restaurant
mccune stopped he knew what the bell
meant the butchers helpers were wait-
ing from behind tables from the bar
from the gallery upstairs they would snipe
at him and get him as he went out vesta
gave a little stifled cry of fear she too
knew what the bell meant

  come here ordered mccune menacing
gutierrez with both revolvers you go
out with me with one of these poked in
your ribs at the first shot you get yours
sabe

  and you vesta continued mccune
you stay here safely ill come again

  he bent forward to kiss her and this was
the chance that the butcher had waited for
-a slimmer chance for himself than he
wanted but since the failure of the other
the only one left and as he got to his feet
with well-feigned clumsiness he suddenly
lifted the lightest table and flung it at
mccune dodging to the floor with the
same movement

 the dancing girl was quicker than

mccune and leaped forward to shield him
the table edge struck her forehead she
sank to the floor with the table on top of her
as mccune began firing first at gutierrez
laying him low with the second shot and
then at the others charging through the
doorway to the attack

  behind another table in a corner mccum
fought tiiem off cornered desperate shor
of ammunition but his soul filled with t 
wild ecstatic glory of battle he had be 
wounded twice

  thisll be the finish he muttered
old dictionary dick was right

  then filling the doorway unarmed but
battle-lights playing in his eyes came dick
reasoner

  i came to arrest this man he shouted
in spanish and so far the bluff and his
positiveness had carried him safely through
quickly he strode to the corner helped
mccune to his feet and with his arm about
him started out

  gutierrez the butcher had regained con-
sciousness mccunes bullet had only
creased his thick scalp his little eves
glinted as he took in the situation then
inch by inch along the floor he moved to an
abandoned revolver as he gripped i
finally mccune and reasoner were almost
to the door mccune leaning against the bir
sailors shoulder limp and tottering from
loss of blood gutierrez aimed careful

  he had been sent to kill mccune and i
he pressed the trigger and saw the limn
form momentarily stiffen and then relax ii
knew he had not missed with a grunt 
satisfaction he turned the revolver or
reasoner who had wheeled at the shot 
mccunes inert body slip to the floor an
crouched for a spring but vesta t
dancing girl was first

  she had seen gutierrez shoot mccune
had tried desperately to clear herself of th
wreckage of the table in time to save him
now as quick as the swoop of a hawk sh
was upon gutierrez and drove her k-en
jewel-handled stiletto into his heart thm
with a cry of anguish she hurled the knif
over the patio wall toward the sea and
followed reasoner and his burden

ran clay mccune died before morn-
i  ns n the sick bay on the rai-bmv
i mii with vesta the dancing girl sitting
beside him her slim hand smoothing his
forehead the captain had given her
skirts and brats



haven and promised her safe passage to her
home in another republic

  i am content senor she told dick
reasoner i could never have held him
he was good so good but wild and i was
true to him senor i have flirted i have
danced i have been gay but to him only
was i wife

  wife

  si senor during the first week i took
my americano to the priest he laugh
sure he say anything goes and it was
so

  and then with that naivete so startling
in the latin she told reasoner something
else which caused reasoner to swallow
a couple of times turn red and then
ask

  whatre you going to do you cant
keep on at this dancing have you any
money

  she smiled at him

  the good captain takes me to my people

it is enough they are rich and i tell mv
father all

  reasoner breathed a sigh of relief what
to do with vesta had worried him and for
once the dictionary had seemed to fail him
as soon as he could he excused himself and
went back to it to apologize slim higgins
joined him

  tell me dick howd you come to go
ashore after mccune

  reasoner shifted his finger from hy-
men which had stared at him blankly be-
fore when he opened the book at random in
his dilemma and turned to another with
a broad calloused finger he pointed to it

  loyalty slim see what it means-
faith allegiance support id been preach-
ing that to clay mccune morning noon
and night and then falling down on it my-
self in my dealings with him i got to
thinking about it and i went after him
but not soon enough slim he finished
sadly not soon enough

by louise ficg

t had been arranged beforehand
that smoke mike and
larry the dip were to watch
at a discreet distance for the ar-
rival of red jumbo so that if he failed to
escape detection and detention the rest of the
gang might be notified of the fact at once

  being inconspicuous criminals so far un-
mugged by the police they waited on the
norfolk wharf for the docking of the boat
from new york two units of the lounging

nondescript crowd of men and boys which
that event always attracted they knew
that red had been lying up over mcgurks
saloon on west third street long enough
to grow a disguising beard and as he had
been in prison for three years previous to
that during which period none of the gang
had seen him they were prepared for some
changc in his appearance

but although they kept their profession-
ally keen eyes on the gangplank he was


adventure

almost abreast of them and had sent the
fleetest of minks in their direction before
they recognized him for he was most effec-
tually disguised he carried a baby girl
who held him tightly around the neck to
his right hand clung a second child an exact
duplicate of the first and a frail quiet-
looking woman in faded mourning walked
beside him if mike and larry had beheld
their pal calmly disembarking accompanied
by a baby elephan t and six blue monkeys they
could not have been more flabbergasted

  for once in their hves they forgot to look
furtively about for possible unfriendly min-
ions of the law openly staring they fol-
lowed red and his amazing entourage to the
street car which would take them out to
ocean view a sort of cheap coney island
where the gang had its headquarters over
the saloon of mcgurk brother to their
metropolitan ally

  obeying red jumbos one backward
glance they sank into rear seats while he
settled the woman and the children in the
forward end of the car only when he had
done so did he glance around ostentatiously
discover them and wave them a greeting

  heres two of my friens now he old
the woman rising ill tell m youre
cornin out

  you are very kind mr gleason she
replied to take all this trou-here beulah
-no no you must not bother our friend

  one of the children had slid from he- -at
and taken a tight hold of jumbos hand

  boolah go wiz oo she stated firmly

  one of red jumbos famous scowls began
to etch itself on his face but before it ould
gather a definite outline something inside of
him suddenly let out a chuckle

  aw nev mind he said to the mother
and walked down the aisle with the  lie
girl

  hello he greeted his gaping pals
meet m frien miss beulah lawton
shake hands beulah wit mister donovan
an mister carter

  thus addressed by their own proper
names which were such conversational
rarities that for a second they failed to
identify themselves both looked helplessly
from the dainty little child to the grinning
jumbo towering over them to his full sue
feet two they nodded and he sat down
facing them

  what the- smoke mike began and
paused bereft of speech

  larry the dip whose correct speech and
thin-lipped narrow face told of a different
birth from the otln r two put out his small
white hand to t  baby who surveyed it
thoughtfully shook hands and smiled
then she hoisicd herself into jumbos arms
where she snuggled comfortably

  this ainl no glad hand im gettin
seems t me red remarked and laughed

  oh spi  -piil it urged smoke mike

norfolk plfun-clothes men is a terror to the
underworld

  red glance dow- cautiously at the child
who had bqgun to doze

red larry remarked in his smooth
cultured voice we shall have to clear
tonight all but maggie we framed her
to stay and give the stall
skirts and brats



  thats all right red jumbo assured
him thats fixed its like this

  finger by finger he began checking off
the plan

boat on poipose you an smoke let th

  silent his friends followed his enumerat-
ing fingers and nodded their comprehension
but looked their doubt red answered as
though they had spoken

  well we dont pull off the job till about
tree them swell hops never gets goin
till after midnight treell be right
theyll be dancin and eatin then you
got the layout all right

  tim got it larry replied hes been

ness red

  yeah red was used to larrys way
of talking well now lookit well get
er to bed about leven anyway an well
have cawfee or somethin fer her t drink
an sleep er-ten hours

  he looked at larry the official knock-out
man of the gang and a real expert in his
line

   i can sleep her for just as long or as short
as you say red he stated with the sure-
ness of genius in its knowledge

  yeah-i know aright how about
you smoke got somethin

  smoke machinist chauffeur safe-blower
and counterfeiter the oldest and most expe-
rienced all-around man in the gang but not
brainy enough for a leader smiled with
satisfaction

  i gotta bird of a car fer th getaway he
said when i get er out a ways an fix er
up th bullsll never spot er shes stored
in a barn back o the view owners in
noo york she wont be looked fer fer a
while th hick that owns th barn dont
use it

  aright well well sleep th skoit an

take th money then well load er in th
car when we start an th kids wit er
they never squeel if im along they-
for the briefest of moments something
clouded his reddish-brown eyes which
matched and complemented his fiery thatch
smoke mike did not notice it but larry did

  so thats aright jumbo went on
quickly you gonna wait fer me back o
th greenhouse yeah-i wont be long
that safes one o th kind im usta along
toward mornin well spill er an th kids

tree besides itll take er a while t get
back itll have t be near a house though

they gotta have somethin t eat-

  he frowned and looked uneasily at the
sleeping child

  i dont like this gag red smoke said
following the glance im leary of it
red jumbo threw up his head and nar-
rowed his eyes

  well go trough wit it th way i say he
returned the finality of his tone and the
domineering look he bent on his two com-
panions explained why he had kept the
leadership of the gang through his absence
from them that five tousandll keep us
for a mont we wont have t give up to
op isaacstein till th papers stop yellin an
thats when th bullsll stop huntin much
an well get moren double if we wait

smoke and larry nodded
thoughtfully the funds of the
gang were far lower than they
should have been in view of the big job they
had on hand-the looting of a famous coun-
try house near norfolk where a ball was to
be held that night if they were forced to
dispose of the booty to the fence who was
usually allied with them but who squeezed
them of every possible cent while the hue
and cry was still in full force they would be
robbed as usual

  but if they could scatter each with
enough money to live on for a month or so-
yes red was right it was worth added
trouble and risk that five thousand dollars
as they thought of it their faces brightened
this was what it was to have the right kind
of a leader during reds absence their
pickings had been very meager

  red jumbo used to watching faces knew
what their decision was before they gave


adventure

him the curt nods which settled it with-
out another word he rose carrying the
sleeping child and went forward to the
woman who welcomed him with a very
pleasant smile

  blonde maggie won the admiration of
both men by her instant comprehension of
what was wanted

  leave it to me she commanded before
they were half through we only got a few
minutes and thereafter she drove them
with an energy which left them breathless

  they finished just as red came along the
boardwalk maggie and larry hastily
checked over each detail while smoke
watched from a window to signal a nearer
approach of the visitors cards and dice
paper-backed novels pictures from the
police gazette tacked on the walls dirt
from the corners glasses and many bottles
from the sideboard maggies red silk waist
from her back-all all were gone

  maggie denuded of some of her yellow
hair and of most of her paint and with all
the ice stripped from her fingers and ears
looked so different that larry had stopped
several times to look at her with astonish-
ment

  remember now smoke she said im-
pressively im mrs mason and youre
my brother mike donovan you work on
the roller-coasters in the season and i run
a peanut-stand you larry-what are
you

  a smile sophisticated sad and grim
flitted over larrys mobile lips

  i am just what i was when you knew me
first he replied a young fellow from one
of the f f vs who had taken to coke and
inferior society

  maggie was not sensitive as a rule but
some color which had not come in a box
stained her cheek at larrys remark he
noticed it but before he could utter the
punctilious apology which his early training
brought to his lips red the woman and the
children were in the room

  larry and maggie together saved the
first half-hour from being one of extreme
constraint for smoke afraid of saying
something out of character contented him-
self with mumbling and jumbo into whose
lap both the children had promptly crawled
was acutely and most uncomfortably self-
conscious despite the fact that the situation
was of his own bringing about

  what he had not counted on was the

effect it had upon himself nor the queer at-
mosphere it had brought upon the rooms
which usually echoed to profanity and
smelled of tobacco and whisky he kept
remembering the last time he had been
there just before he was nabbed there
had been a fight that night

  and now here were all sorts of things
changed by a woman and two babies
there was maggie without the inevitable
cigaret without the flash of diamonds-
maggie in a white waist and an oddly sub-
dued manner there was larry talking
the way larry could but seldom did there
was smoke silent with clean hands there
was mcgurk sneaking up the back stairs to
look at the new arrival and remaining to
stare open-mouthed at jumbo until a
scowl sent him scurrying below but not
without the upward flung echo of a laugh
and most of all there was the amazing the
disconcerting the incredible sensation ot
two warm little bodies snuggled against
him and the fragrance of their dainty little
selves in his nostrils

  it got on toward noon usually mcgurk
sent up a lunch from the saloon below
to as many of the gang as might be on
hand what should be done under these
circumstances red jumbo gradually get-
ting over his state-or rather getting used
to it-raised his eyebrows at maggie but it
was the mother of the twins who answered
the question which they were all asking
themselves

  ive been smelling your dinner for some
time mrs mason she said and i know
you want to go and look after it youll
let me help wont you

  for a moment maggie looked helplessly
at red the meal was cooking in the kit-
chen of the saloon then her womans in-
ventiveness came to her aid

  why the truth is that aint my dinner
she acknowledged ive been over to my
sisters in norfolk all week an i just got
home before you and r- and mr gleason
arrived i aint got a thing in the house
im sorry to say but i thought soon as you
was feeling at home id go out and-

  little mrs lawton with a gay smile and
a child-like clap of her hands interrupted
her

  let me let me she cried ive
been living in a boarding-house for two
years ever since my husband died and im
just homesick for a cook-stove i want to
skirts and brats



buy everything and cook it dont say i
cant

  they couldnt do anything with her
she swept everything before her with en-
thusiasm with good comradeship she
found a basket big and strong in which
mcgurk usually sent up bottles she in-
sisted that maggie tell her what was lack-
ing in the larder she tied a towel around
smokes waist and set him to peeling pota-
toes against her return and before they
knew how she had done it she had carried
off j umbo bearing the basket and a sheepish
expression on shopping intent

  i dunno watinells struck red smoke
complained as he went at his task this
skoits actin s though she owned him i
hope shes got the wad red says she
has

  maggie did not answer she was laying
the table with linen and silver hastily re-
quisitioned from mcgurk remembering
some old forms which had not occurred to
her for many a day larry went down to
the corner where there was a cheap florist
and brought back a big bunch of the small
yellow roses which are virginias most dis-
tinctive flower

  maggie sniffed the spicy odor thought-
fully

  we usta have a big bush of these she
said to nobody in particular larry turned
quickly and looked out of the window he
did not want his face to be seen just then
there had been a long row of those big
bushes before a big pillared house where his
memory sometimes strayed

  beulah and lulu confided to maggies
care by their mother trotted after the girl
asking questions getting in her way and
sometimes imperiously demanding to be
kissed once without their asking maggie
stooped and gathered them fiercely into
her arms but they were not frightened
they hugged back with their strong little
arms and kissed her tenderly when they
saw tears in her eyes

  mrs lawton brought back a basket filled
to the brim and a strangely silent man
but she herself bubbled over with good
spirits she praised smokes pile of pota-
toes she put the chickens she had brought
on to roast she set larry to shelling peas
she asked maggie for her favorite recipe
she declared nothing in the world had ever
looked as good to her as those virginia roses
and that the culinary operations might be

unhampered she put the twins into jumbos
capacious arms for safe-keeping

  somewhere maggie had unearthed two
aprons somehow straightening the window
shades and setting chairs and bureaus to
rights maggie had contrived to give the
place such a domestic look that red felt
himself actually abashed before it he and
larry and smoke sat together smelling
homelike odors and listening to the bits of
conversation which drifted out of the kit-
chen how beulah had had the measles
last year and did maggie think the largest
chicken was browning too fast and were
there good dry-goods stores in norfolk now
and where was the potato-masher

  casual unimportant woman-talk all
that but very very strange to the ears of
two of the men who listened to larry it
was not strange but it was dreadful
to smoke it was queer but umneaning
to jumbo who had never heard its like be-
fore it was a part of the confusion which
was slowly taking its grip upon his soul

       the dinner was an unqualified suc-
cess even to smoke who surveyed
the glass of water beside his plate
with extreme distaste but before he
could say anything the twins solemnly
folding their fat hands bowed their heads
and murmured

  for yis meal god make us tooly sank-
ful amen

  maggie and larry and red who had
hastily ducked their heads in accord with
mrs lawtons were crimson at the con-
clusion of the little ceremony especially as
they met the sardonic grin of smoke who
had chosen to fill in time by eating the cole-
slaw at his plate

  they fingered over the meal strangely
loath to break up the association of the
table it was fairly quiet the season
had not really opened yet and most of the
attractions at the beach were still closed
the late afternoon sun came slithering in
while they still sat on beulah and lulu
despite their mothers remonstrance had
returned to jumbos lap

  i havent felt so happy since poor tom
was taken from me mrs lawton said

  she pushed back her chair humming a
tune she broke off a rose and pushed it
through her heavy dark hair there was a
beautiful faint color in her cheeks and
her eyes were sweet and deep she had


adventure

probably never been beautiful but she was
something more compelling than that she
shone with a sort of glory red jumbo
looked at her so steadily that she blushed
a little then swiftly she turned around
to the piano and broke out into a clear
haunting contralto

  she sang absent and juanita and
old black joe the harbor bar and
rocked in the cradle of the deep
every time that she stopped and swung
around they begged her to go on they
leaned forward in their chairs as the twi-
light settled on them and gave themselves
up to her and she took their hearts with
her far far from anything they had ever
known then when it was too dark to see
she began something and the two children

stirring piped up with her-

  jesus loves me this i know for the
bible tells me so

  smoke snorted and tramped down-stairs
but maggie and larry and jumbo shadows
in their chairs did not move and mrs
lawton when that song was done began
nearer my god to thee

  she got up after she had finished that

  i reckon that will be good night for the
babies she remarked casually and
you folks must be tired of listening to me
she moved toward the door but beulah
and lulu objected they wanted to be
kissed dood night they wanted to hug
jumbo they wanted miser lawy to goas
far as the hall they wanted aunt maggie
to promise to tuck them in

  im afraid my little girls are too wilful
the mother said over her shoulder as she
finally led them away ive spoiled them
maybe

  they could hear her singing in maggies
room as she undressed the babies after a
while maggie lit the gas

  smoke came up the stairs treading
lightly

  jes bin out t look around he whis-
pered doc an tims come in say
aint dis skoit de limit

  no one replied he looked from one
face to the other puzzled

  say whats eatin youse yuh look
like a bunch o rummies

  still no one spoke then jumbo lifted
his head and licked his dry lips several
times swallowed and stood up

  you-you keep yore tongue offn erl
he said huskily

  aw is that so smoke sneered
whadcha do fall fer de skoit

  jumbos blazing eyes menaced him

  shut up he ordered with a warning
glance toward the bedroom

  mrs lawton was still singing a little

  smokes mean little eyes narrowed

  s-a-a-y he drawled wats degag

  jumbo opened and shut his big hands

  i started this an im goin trough wit
it my way see i-she-i dunno how
its goin t lay-but i aint goin t have
any-i aint goint take er wad an that
goes see

  an i spose de rest is in on dis smoke
demanded

  jumbo looked at the other two larry
nodded his lips set in a thin hard line
maggie whimpered

  i aint had a kid around for years she
said

  jumbo brought his eyes back to smoke

  yeah- he said and in his excitement
forgot to keep his voice lowered an
wats more i aint goin trough wit
tnight either im-i aint goin to thats
all

  there was a slight a very slight move-
ment of smokes right hand and something
shining lay in it

  i tought yuh was failin fer de skoit he
growled i seen yuh yah yuh make
me sick yuh better change yore mind
quick r yuh wont have none left tchange
for ill drill yore bean yuh cant put dis
over dyuh tink de rest o de gangs goin

yuh n yuh neednt be lookin like-i got
de drop on yuh an-

  and i have the drop on you smoke
said a very quiet voice from the doorway
move your hand an inch and ill shoot it
off

  like automatons they wheeled their
jaws simultaneously fell open mrs law-
ton was in the room with a large business-
like revolver in what each one of them saw
was a practised hand

  what th- smoke began and lowered
his weapon

  he was an indifferent shot only the
fact that he was sure red jumbo was un-
armed had allowed him to call the turn on
him but he knew that this woman could
and would do what she said though how and
why   
going west



  put it on the floor she ordered

  he did it she motioned that he should
stand back by the stairs then she looked
at the others

  they used to call me chicago bessie 
she announced simply

  a murmur an indrawn breath answered
her chicago bessie the slickest con-
fidence-woman in the business one of the
cleverest coolest female crooks known to
the underworld

  jumbo took a stiff step nearer to her

  so-you was stallin he said you
- he laughed huh i tought-some-
thin diffrent

  no i wasnt stalling her reply was to
him alone i got into bad ways when i
married tom i guess you people didnt
know him hed have been a good man if
he hadnt been so weak and i was young
but i was raised right jumbo just as i
told you on a farm near here i never got
sent up until two years before tom died
the babies were only three months old
it nearly killed me and when i got
out last year he was dead and they had
been boarding with a good woman the
first night i was home they knelt down and
said their prayers at my knees and i
changed thats all

  her eyes were filling filling and a sob
which she could not control broke in her
throat

  whadcha come here wit me for

  i knew who you were

 you-

  he fell back a step and his face darkened
if yore workin wit th bulls- he
began

  i knowed it i knowed it smoke
croaked and moved only to stop midway
of his crouch for his weapon

  ive still got the drop on you smoke
chicago bessie told him and  dont have
to see to shoot straight

  she fumbled with her left hand for her
handkerchief and wiped away her tears

  fer gawds sake tell me th trut
jumbo implored i gotta know

  i knew you on the boat she said
you were pointed out to me once and

i	knew about the gang too and i took a
chance i-i told you id changed ive
tried to get hold of people that had gone
wrong- ive tried to do a little good i
left my money with the purser and i came
out here with you hoping i could do or say
something-or that god would let my little

girls soften your hearts-

  it seemed that she could not go on and
then she dropped to her knees

  oh my dear lord she prayed i
dont know what to say to these dear peo-
ple but you know what i want i want
them for you thats why i came i-
help me tell me what to say

  cursing smoke turned and tramped
loudly down the stairs slamming the street
door after him larry and maggie who
were crying knelt down chicago bessie
looked up at jumbo

  and you she asked

 a

gordon young
     joclholt

his happened between sunset
and dawn one night not on
but rather close to the mexican
border where jose juarez the
gambler somewhat tentatively held a place
of respect for himself in the tarantula
dance and gambling hall jose was
quiet unobtrusive he had hard eyes
and nimble fingers and wore his holster
high on the left of his breast in such a way
that it was concealed by the serape always
thrown across the shoulder

  doug walsh who was suspected of having
more notches on his guns-he packed two-
than graves he had filled but who never-
theless was with good reason feared some-
times boasted that he would shortly find
out just how quickly that greaser could
draw but for some cause or other he
like the cowboys that flocked around the
bar and grumbled about a mexican treat-
ing himself as their equal hesitated to
come to gun-play although heaven knows
there was excuse enough to pick a quarrel
since louise lawton often turned from one
of them to dance with him

  louise was a queer girl pretty of course
or there wouldnt have been anything
to quarrel over but she was different
from the other girls perhaps not prettier
for beauty is a matter of taste but she
seemed to understand men better-that is
she perhaps better understood all of them
excepting her own brother and everybody
but her knew that he was worse than no
good being a cheat a coward a liar a kind
of sickly weakling in body and soul

  he was weak rather than evil which is a
poor apology for a fellow who even as he
promised his sister not to gamble was
wheedling money out of her for no other
purpose and who pulled with doug walsh
-when everybody knew that sheriff clif-
ford was keeping suspicious eyes on that
desperado-and merely grinned nervously
at the abuse walsh piled on to him and
who had been caught stealing from a
drunken mans pocket-there is no need
to recite what all else but to louise he
was her brother and that kept him from
having his neck wrung a dozen times a
month

  and she was under the-delusion that he
was her protector that the reason men
were more respectful to her was because
she alone of all the girls at the tarantula
had a brother

  louise was rather short of irrepressible
vitality and vivid her hair was black and
her eyes blue and she wore a short scarlet
skirt black silk stockings tiny slippers
with glittering brass buckles sometimes
her low-necked waists were of black some-
times of yellow silk the men did not
paw her over even when they had been
drinking she knew how to evade un-
welcome caresses without giving offense
she knew how to keep men at arms length
even though the very exclusion heightened
the desire for contact as has been said
she understood men

  she detested doug walsh and continued
to be friendly with jose juarez though
she knew that the mexican was intensely in
the greaser



love with her and sometimes annoyed her
with talk about marriage but he was a
wonderful dancer always respectful and
had something about him-which was
poise though she probably had never heard
the word-that she liked

  she suspected that juarez was a half-
breed but he wore the picturesque mexican
dress velvet trousers sewn with silver
buttons up the side a jacket of black velvet
trimmed with buttons and silver em-
broidery and a white ruffled shirt he also
wore the small made-to-order boots and
large decorated sombrero of the horseman
though he seldom rode and did not own a
horse when one stays up all night there
is little inclination for the saddle the next
day

  louise had time and again asked jose
not to play cards with her brother louise
did not know it but charles falsely at-
tributed all of his losses at cards to the
mexican-though he did lose and often
all he had every time he played with jose
for the gambler knew from whence charles
got most of his money a queer thing too
jose never seemed to have any luck if he
sat in a game where louise chanced to be
playing-but she she had to make a
pocketbook of her skirt to carry home the
winnines

  charley louise said after she had
scooted off the dance-floor to evade doug
walsh nrl found her brother across from
the me m at a table in an alcove you
proi   - you wouldnt play again

  a  i m not playing just penny ante

  chu les was nervous jose had noticed
it he had noticed too that several times
during the evening charles and doug walsh
slipped into the shadows and jose spying
with catlike inscrutable eyes surmised that
the gunman was either trying to bully
charles into doing something or to hold
him to a promise that had already been
forced out of him charles would promise
almost anybody anything

  fie himself had pulled charles away
from the bar where thomas a nester with a
homestead about five miles out on the lone
pinon road was foolishly buying drinks
from a wad that represented a successful
alfalfa crop-incidentally while mrs
thomas sat with the dull patience of a
work-worn woman nursing a few-months-
old baby in a buckboard out in front and
waited jose thought it better for charles

to be gambling mildly with him than
brewing deviltry with doug walsh

  jose had two and a half crosses cut on
the handle of his gun he had cut the
half cross one night when louise had
slapped doug walshs face and had then
coolly stared down the bad man though
both of his guns had leaped from their
holsters

  the half of a cross had not been cut
however until after jose had said ex-
pectantly to charles-

  the son of a skunk has insulted your
sister

  charles had concealed his fear and agi-
tation under a pitiable attempt at uncon-
cern

  aw doug didnt mean nothing hes
a good fellow lou is too - touchy

anyway

  charles had averted his face as he said it
jose had hard eyes to stare into 

  but one good thing about charles he
was not a trouble-maker a tale-bearer
he never told doug what the mexican
said or any of the other insulting remarks
that jose let fall doug would have gone
loco if he had known what jose was saying
of him even when louise came up

  well quit right now she told her
brother who had tried to fend off her
protest with the excuse of penny ante
and you tell doug walsh that if he isnt
looking for trouble to keep his dirty hands
off me you have to make him stop that

rough stuff charley-

  pardon me jose interrupted softly-
his voice was ever smooth as velvet almost
musical but if you will permit i shall take
pleasure in speaking to him for you
thanks jose she answered playfully
tossing a rose petal toward him ive
heard that before

  but seiiorila jose said standing up
resolutely

  no no sit down charley will tell
him again and jose promise me you
wont play with charley any more-tonight
at least he hasnt any money anyway
no charles answered in an injured
tone but you have id have cleaned him
tonight if id have had anything to bet
gee id bet a wad big as thomas on the
hand fore this

  i will promise jose said to her and
added with a smile that is as long as i
know he hasnt any money


adventure

  when louise walked away charles fol-
lowed her he was back in a few minutes
and coaxing the gambler to play but jose
refused others in plenty were playing
poker

  shell spot me charles lamented
about the second hand hey you he
called to a cowboy jim of the frying pan
outfit give me that lid and coat of yours
and ill sit with my back to the door

  jim was one of those who liked louise
very much

  ill give you the coat he said for the
evening was warm and he was ready to shed
the unaccustomed garment anyway but
not this j b its new get joses rain
tent itll hide you

  and jose permitted charles to take the
sombrero with its embroidery and silver
band worth about thirty times as much
as jims new stetson and charles cast his
own hat toward a corner and sitting down
with his back to the dance-hall door began
to play

 an hour later doug walsh who had
looked all over the place for him discovered
charles

  come on well have to ride like -

whatchu try in to do hide out from
me in that rig thomas been gone quarter
of an hour r more

ii

some time after midnight fifteen
or twenty minutes past jose cashed
in at the game he was playing and
started to go out on the dance-floor to find
louise and he bumped into charles

 where is my som-

  he got no further charles pushed back
the hat-his own-that he was wearing
as he excitedly flashed a fist-full of currency
in the gamblers face

  come on you know i got some money
now i owe you a trimmin-bout a dozen
of em

  jose shook his head thoughtfully

  dont be a piker

  jose remembered the time louise had
sold her ring a small diamond that sheriff
clifford had bought for a watch charm-
not because he wanted it either except
that he thought louise needed the money-
and charles had got that money and lost
it in a game that jose did not happen to
sit in

  all right jose said imperturbably
well get off in a corner and have a little
stud

  thats me i want to get some action
for my money ill show you where to
head in too believe me

  as they passed by the bar looking for
an empty poker-room doug walsh was
uproariously calling everybody up to have a
drink

  jose heard him but pretended not to
and walked on

  he did not hear what doug walsh said
for walsh who had been buying and drink-
ing recklessly had seen it took all of the
persuasion of joe and jim-called the
twins of the frying-pan-to induce walsh
to postpone the threats that he poured
out against the blankety-blankety-blankety-
blank greaser doug was in a fighting
mood and looking for trouble

  one reason was that he knew he had
almost everybody bluffed another that
he had plenty of money and the man with
money whether in the barroom or in the
wall street bank seems to think it his
privilege to be insulting when in the least
crossed but he talked so much about
what he was going to do and how he was
going to do it to the b b b b greaser
that he forgot what he was talking about
and continued to buy drinks

  in the meantime jose and young lawton
were playing stud the gambler who
always appeared on the verge of being
bored and scarcely ever seemed to take
much interest in the game sat quietly
watching the cards fall

  he never looked more than once at the
card faced down and then barely glimpsed
the pip and made his bets nonchalantly as
the others fell face-upward

  charles who had a mania for gambling
peeped at the hole card as though to assure
himself that it hadnt changed spots every
time a new card was dealt

  charles had been getting some good
hands and was betting strong-as he
always did once he had bluffed-or
thought he had bluffed-jose out when
the mexican had him beat in sight

  jose had smiled slightly it had been
his deal the next time that it was ins
deal charles got an ace in the hole and two
more aces fell with the third card dealt
jose had only a deuce and four in
sight
the greaser



  ill let you down easy to coax you
along charles said shoving in a small
piece of silver

  no man would-or at least should-
stand for a heavy bet with a pair of aces
againsi him when at most he could have
nothin lore than a pair of fours with only
two - ards more to be drawn

  if i remember correctly jose said
softly you stole a pot for me a few minutes
ago now climb aboard this and he
pushed a few bills into the center of the
table

  charles as anybody would have done
came back with a raise jose saw it and
dealt

  charles got a ten-spot and jose paired
the four

  three fours beat a pair of aces jose
remarked

  charles took another squint at the hole
card bet was raised raised again and was
met

  the last card gave charles a three-spot
and jose paired the deuce in sight

  of all the luck charles muttered
taking another peep at his ace in the hole
and trying to appear down-hearted

  jose bet-he not only bet but he tapped
charles pile then flipped over the hole
card and revealed the third deuce

  you are the luckiest gre-

  but charles did not finish he had
caught the glint in joses eyes

  senor jose said stiffly i was born
north of the rio grande i am an amer-
ican

  charles protested that he didnt mean
anything that he knew jose was the best
fellow in ten lands and wound up by
borrowing a few dollars from him

  as jos sorted the bills he noticed one
almost half-gone a twenty-dollar bill
it was that had been torn in the middle
or nearly in the middle but he put it in
with the rest making a separate roll of the
bils taken from charles

  a ew minutes later a half-hour or so
louise declared she had never played in
such luck in her life she too noticed the
torn bill as she took the pot from jose
and the others about the table marveled
that this mexican gambler who made a fat
living off the green-clothed tables should
have been trimmed by a girl that always
showed it in her face when she had a good
hand

ill

when mrs thomas staggered into
the dance-hall the babe in her arms
and weakly told her story there was
cursing and clattering of feet shouting
among the men and hysterical high-voiced
horror and sympathy from the girls and
presently the furious beat of hoofs as sheriff
clifford and the cowboys dashed away in
the night to the scen of the murder

  me and bill was ridin along home
she said the tears gushing afresh down along
the dried stains on her dusty thin face
an he was singin loud cause hed had a
little too much fore we started an i was
feedin it again cause it had the colic
somethin awful an had been cryin and
then i heard somebody ridin fast an they
shouted to bill to stop i thought i heard
two hosses but i didnt see nobody but

one feller bill said go to -an

whipped up the hosses then they started
shootin bill was shootin an a-drivin
like mad

  all of a sudden he jest says my gawd
an throwed up both hands an fell off an
i knowed theyd got him i tried to get
the reins but havin it  missed em and
the hosses turned out an upset the wagon
an i thought i was killed but i heard
it cryin an it dont pear to be hurt none
jest scratched pore little thing its
father-i-i-found bill-an-then-i jest
had to git here-oh god what will i do

  louise had taken the baby the sickly
little tired thing had cried itself into
exhaustion and the side of its tender face
and body was red and black from the fall
some one brought a chair for the mother
who was weeping on the shoulder of a
kneeling girl-a girl whose shoulders were
bare and whose lips and cheeks were
covered with paint-that held mrs
thomas head and tried with phrases
that came strangely in her hoarse coarse
voice to comfort the stricken woman

  in seconds rather than minutes the dance-
hall was emptied of men jose the bar-
tender and charles remained jose and
the bartender had no horses and charles
had been sent for a drink of water and
continued to hold the glass after mrs
thomas had drunk from it

  at the bartenders suggestion mrs
thomas was taken into a room off the bar
where he had a cot and all the girls crowded
o

adventure

in there too futilely and flutteringly trying
to do something while he got a little wine
for her

  the baby began to cry and louise
holding it tightly and tenderly to her
breast left the room and walked up and
down the dance-floor the dance-hall was
deserted except for jose who stood thought-
fully by a window staring out into the
darkness and for charles who sat on a
chair still holding the glass but with his
head bent down on to his chest

  from somewhere doug walsh appeared
he had spent his last dollar some minutes
before mrs thomas came with her poign-
ant story but declaring that he knew
where he could get plenty more money
he had gone out again and dug up a tin
can that had had buried about three hours
before he had heard shouting and riding
and wondered at it he was surprised to
find the dance-hall empty but though he
had a suspicion as to what had happened
he did not care nobody would suspect

him - no it had been an inspiration

on his part that had made him knock off
that sombrero charles had worn and leave
it on the road doug was feeling fine

  he swaggered up to louise pointed in
jest an accusing finger at the babe and
asked-

  yours eh

  louise looked at him in angry amaze-
ment it was not the insult to her-she
was a dance-hall girl-but the utter bru-
tality of jesting over a babe when the blood
of its murdered father was scarcely cold

  well doug went on gloating over his
humor any time you want another-

  charley she cried you hear this
dog

  and she ran from the room

  doug turned toward charles and laughed
insultingly he laughed the louder when
also he noticed jose standing by young
lawton

  going to kill him jose whispered
softly tensely

  a shudder perceptibly quivered through
charles body

  we must make her think you are a
man-anyway jose said as he looked up
toward the approaching doug

  yes i heard you you - greaser

ive had about enough out of you and
heres where-

  as the desperado broke off he reached

for his guns he had gripped the handles
while joshs fingers were still softly tapping
the buttons of his jacket and then in one
movement so swift as almost to elude
observation joses right hand flashed
upward toward his left shoulder as the
other hand pulled aside the serape-the
shot was fired as dougs guns swung clear
of their holsters but only one shot was
fired and doug fell like a dropped stone
with a black hole squarely in the center of
his forehead

  here-you-quick jose had said to
charles even as he had shot and he
pressed the boys trembling fingers about
the big white ivory handle of the revolver
and then leaped aside so that the scared-
faced girls that rushed in were in time
to see the revolver still smoking even as
charles looked down at it in a kind of dull
amazement

  but jose his fingers gently tapping the
bright buttons of his jacket stood some
four feet away his face emotionless in-
scrutable as ever

  ask louise why the boy borrowed my
gun jose said to the bartender who shoved
his way past the girls

  every one knew that charles was un-
armed but though they might wonder
and they did they could not doubt their
eyes charles had killed the gunman and
in a square fight for doug walsh was facing
him and had both guns out of heir holsters

  louise hastily gave the baby to some one
else and fell weeping in a mingling of horror
and gratification about the neck of her
bewildered brother

iv

when sheriff clifford followed by
an angry crowd came through the
tarantula doorway the first object
that every one saw was the sombrero in
his hand

  jose raised his arms above his head it
was dangerous to hesitate or make a false
move before that mob of angry faces

  that shows it the coward admits it
greaser lynchins too good and kindred
remarks ran in whispers undertones and
shouts through the room

  senores- jose began

  shut up the sheriff said ill do the
talkin this- shaking the sombrero-
was there and some of the fellers say
the greaser



you had quite a wad on you tonight-bills
we know you always draw gold from
the bank-

  but let me- jose began again

  you cant explain nothing voices
menacing voices called out

  at the word bills louise reached under
her skirts and removed the bulging object
just below her garter a few people
crowded around her to see

  senores jose said though shouts and
jeers came at him i have not worn the
sombrero all evening you remember-
he addressed jim of the frying-pan outfit-
that i gave it to charles and-

  jim was an honest fellow he believed
the greaser was guilty but he admitted that
what he had said was true

  i give it back charles muttered
huskily

  in his hand was still the heavy ivory-
handled revolver of joses

  right then charles word was unques-
tioned unquestionable for it had been
rapidly spread among the returning posse
that charles in a fair fight had killed doug
walsh whose unattended body lay on a
table in one of the poker-rooms

  an by all thats holy shouted the
bartender plucking a half of a twenty-dollar
bill from louises hand heres the very
bill thomas tore tnight lit a cigaret with
half of it an tried to git me to break the
other half-this very bill i wouldnt
do it

  that settles it a voice cried and the
men nodded sternly one to another

  then some one jerked sheriff cliffords
gun from his holster and joe of the frying-
pan put his own gun squarely into the
sheriffs face saying

  now sheriff there aint no man we-all
respect moren you but there aint goin to
be no law take its course in this were
going to hang this greaser to a sycamore
down theren the grove aint that right-
boys

  oaths nods and a few thats rights
given in even solemn voices made answer
the death sentence was thereby delivered
it was not a mob it was a small band
suddenly grown quiet stern in the awful
dignity that comes over men when they
pass death-judgment on a fellow-man

  in the hushed tenseness the impact of
all eyes was on the face of jose and some
hearts shamed the breasts they were in by

o

beating the quicker in a kind of vagrant
admiration for a man who could look back
at them with cold steady gaze his face
was inscrutable for all the fear revealed
he might have been in a game watching a
drunken man bluffing against a pat hand

  he turned his head he spoke quietly
and charles-with averted face-trembled
as with ague when he heard jose ask

  have you nothing to say senor you
know they will not listen to me

  charles did not answer

  joe of the frying-pan took the rope that
jim had brought him put a loop around
joses neck drew it snug but not tight and
without a word started out of the door
the men gave way and fell into line behind
the gambler who still held his hands above
his head

  you wont make no rumpus one of the
two men detailed to watch sheriff clifford

asked

  i know it wouldnt do no good the
sheriff acknowledged saying lie only thing
he would without admitting that he was
glad the law was not to be permitted to
take its course in punishing so dastardly a
crime

  and they started out

  faintly faintly and plaintively from the
room where it had been placed by its
mother the insistent protesting cry of the
baby floated into the dance-hall and the
grim faces of silent men were turned
listening for a moment then they
tramped out

  some of the girls-not all for many
turned aside with tense lips and strained
eyes-hastily grabbed shawls to envelop
their heads and followed

  to think i used to like that greaser
louise said brokenly

  in the stillness of the room where there
were only half-uttered whispers and soft
footsteps among those that remained who
felt even then as if in the presence of the
dying the shrill insistent quick frightened
voice of the baby broke in convulsive
screams

  charles nervously flung his hands to his
ears

  louise turned to hurry to the poor little
thing so insistent in its tiny rage

  lou charles said weakly almost
inquiringly

  what is it boy

  nothing-now


adventure

  she started again

  lou-whered they carry doug to

  i dont know the barkeep got some-
body to take it away ive got to stop that
baby oh lord this is awful

  again she started and again he called
fearful of letting her get out of his sight
what is it she asked impatiently
lou ive just got to talk-i cant-
i cant- and his voice went into a sob

  come on boy she said tenderly
putting an arm around him i know
youre all knocked out-its an awful night-
and it isnt morning yet

  they had no sooner reached the room
where mrs thomas unconscious lay moan-
ing than the baby worn out utterly ex-
hausted fell for a moment into unresting
sleep

 oh god what made it do that
charles exclaimed quickly as an instant later
the baby opened its large dark-blue eyes
and stared for countable seconds straight
at him with all the weird majestic wisdom
of infancy in its gaze

  oh lou-oh lou he cried catching
hold of her dont let em hang jose he
didnt do it lou he didnt doug made
me go with him i didnt want to go
honest to god lou-doug did it

  louise did not say anything she gasped
in one long horrified breath as she stared
bewildered unbelieving at her brothers
distorted fear-gripped face

  jose killed doug-i didnt do it-he
shoved the gun into my hand he didnt
know doug did it-thomas i mean i
didnt want to go i never give jose back
his hat and doug knocked it off out there
dont let em hang him lou you wont
will you let em hang him

  but the barkeep--

  he won it off me-jose did i dont
know how much doug got he said i
hadnt done my share that shows im
innocent lou dont you see it does
i didnt do nothin but go with him i
didnt even have a gun jose shot doug
for what he said to you and shoved the gun
in my hand-said you must think i was a-
was a man

  louise gripped his shoulders with both
her hands

  charley-charley

  her voice called his name but it was her
wide-staring eyes that implored him to
deny it to say it was not true but he only

slumped into a chair and sobbed as he
nodded his head to affirm all that he had
confessed

  and through it all the baby slept rest-
ively but without crying

v

a horse stood at the hitching
rack the bridle reins trailed on
the ground but it was tied with a
hackamore doug walsh when he tied it
there had made one of those curious slip-
knots which when the end is pulled straight
out come undone with a jerk but if the end
is pulled back through the loop and jerked
it tightens and is likely not to come untied
without time and patience

  fumbling in the darkness louise tightened
the knot she tried to take off the hack-
amore from the horses head but in an idle
moment doug had spliced it so that it fitted
snugly in one piece there was no other
horse at the rack charles had bor-
rowed one when he rode with doug and
they had all been ridden down to the grove
which was a mile and a little more
away

  louise gasped and cried as she tugged at
the rope seconds were speeding away like
frantic runners in single file any second
might snatch at joses life and carry it on

  she ran back and into the dance-hall and
cried hysterically for some one to give her a
knife

  the girls looked helplessly one from
another then some one mentioned the knife
behind the bar used to cut lemons

  as louise dashed for it she met the bar-
tender coming out of one of the poker rooms
he held a handful of bills in front of him

  whatchu know about this he called
at her found em on the floor in there-
mustve fell out of his-

  louise gave a glance toward the doorway
a dead man with a handkerchief thrown over
his face lay on the table

  she did not stay to listen or explain but
snatched the knife and ran leaped from the
door cut the rope with one stroke of the
sharp steel climbed into the saddle and rode
as though fleeing from terror

  the night was black but she knew the
way

  as she came in sight of the grove she saw
a fire a small fire built to light up the
rustlers roost as the old limb was
with pistol and second reader



called where many a horse and maverick-
thief had been stretched by the neck and
she could see the black shadows of men
moving back and forth

  she cried out but she might as well have
tossed her voice to a gale

  beating the sharp heels of her dancing
slippers against the flanks of the horse
and slapping him with ends of the reins
she dashed on once to bring a burst of
speed she pricked him with the point of the
knife and he gave such a bound as nearly
to unseat her

  and as she rode she saw one of the
shadows between her and the fire slowly
being raised from the ground

  it was jose

  again she cried the distance was less
than before and her voice was one shrill
shriek that rose like a banshee wail in the
still night she had been heard

  a few moments later horse and rider
plunged through the circle about the fire
and as a score of hands reached for her-
reached out to catch and stop her-she
rose in the stirrups and with a savage
upwardslash cut the rope and the body

of the gambler fell heavily to the ground

  the next instant she had thrown herself
from the saddle and was pulling at the tight
noose about his neck as she flung incoherent
words at the stern tense faces that were
closing in angry at this interference with
their grim justice

  her brothers name doug walshs name
joses name and the name of thomas were
jumbled confusedly in the frantic words
she shouted but slowly those who heard
understood and looked from one to another
wondering unbelieving awed

  then sheriff clifford spoke

  now boys its as hard for me to believe
this as it is for you but maybe weve all
made a mistake maybe wed better talk
it over an see if there was any time tonight
when this grea- i mean this fellow here
was away from the dance-hall we all
know louise wouldnt accuse that brother
o hers unless-

  louise cried out her voice choking with
anguish and with that larger inarticulate
horror that binds the throat in the presence
of one who has been greatly wronged-and
is dead

wistolanecond reader

author of the bully of the big santee blood of ike allisons ctc

t seemed the best thing to do
 a the boy burrowed feet-fore-
l i j most into the haystack until
the top of his tousled head was
even with the outside

night had fallen an hour before and he
had walked all of eighteen rough miles

barefoot that day but he was too genuinely
painfully hungry to go to sleep easily so
he lay there in the haystack defiant rather
than lonesome or sorry for himsdf and
watched the steady white electric street-
lamps of the town in the valley just below

  they were queer lights to him he had


adventure

seen nothing like them in the big blue
mountains that he was leaving behind him
forever but there would be many many
strange things in the new world that lay
ready for his conquering he resolved that
he would not be surprised at anything he
saw

  the second reader and the pistol hurt his
side he took them out of his dirty striped
cotton shirt and pushed them carefully
into the hay just above his head very
carefully for the pistol was all that he had
left to remind him of his father ironhead
bill faley and the worn old second
reader had been given to him as a story-
book by the meek and long-suffering little
mother before the cataclysm-it was his
good book verily his shannons code of
life his history and encyclopedia of the
universe

  then he went to sleep and dreamed of
the tailor and the king

  at the bright dawn he awoke with his
mind filled with thoughts of kings and
queens would there be a royal family in
tiie little lowland city down there he
asked himself the question in all seriousness
you see he was only twelve years old and
he knew the world only through hearsay
and that beloved second reader he believed
every blessed word that was in the book
and less than half of that which hehadlieard

  then he took the old pistol from the hay
looked for the twentieth time since he had
left laurel gap to see that it was loaded
and slipped it inside his shirt if there was
a king he was ready and anxious to fight
that monarchs enemies

  fight david faley his middle name
should have been fight the men of his
people had fought themselves to death
literally fought themselves to death
ironhead bill had been the chief of the clan
when bill faley and his little son were the
only faleys left in the laurel gap country
they had fled to north carolina ironhead
bill was heartbroken and sick over his wifes
untimely passing and no longer able to give
battle to the wansleys who were legion
and in the north carolina hills he had died

  but never for a minute were those hills
home to the boy david he had made his
way back to laurel gap to find that there
he was an outcast a pariah simply because
he was a faley one old woman had
thrown him a moldy pone of cornbread
as one throws a bone to a dog and that was

the single expression of kindliness he had
had shown him upon his return to laurel
gap

  david had hurled the moldy bread into
the hags face and stood her four grown
sons off with the revolver he carried then
he had promised an early funeral to the man
who followed him and put out for that place
of mystery that they called johnsville
in the afternoon of that day a farmers
wife had given him something to eat for
splitting an armful of stovewood

  the must be a king he told himself as
he crept out of the haystack the must
be a long and a queen and ef the is ill
shore see em afore i lay me down to sleep
agin

  david faley brushed off the wisps of hay
that clung to his ragged clothing arranged
the pistol so that the waistband of his
trousers would hold it and the blousing of
his shirt would hide it and put the second
reader in with it then he went down the
grassy slope and into the valley he drank
from a spring brook made a sort of break-
fast on apples and berries and walked
toward town

  there was no sign of a castle but he saw
many houses houses of brick and stone
and wood but no houses built of whole logs
david went slowly down the main business
street the signs he saw over doors and
on windows were of fascinating interest to
him he spelled them all out and he was
very proud of his ability to read-none of

the- wansleys he remembered could

read there were more lawyers than any-
thing else it seemed and he didnt know
what a lawyer was

  he asked a passer-by

  a lawyer frowned the man a cynic
without doubt a lawyer son is a liar

  the man walked on david stood look-
ing soberly at his back

  a lawyer is a liar muttered the lad to
himself no faley couldnt be a lawyer
then a faley never told a lie

  it had been their redeeming feature it
had been their religion-a faley never
told a lie

  suddenly david halted before a tailors
sign and his brown eyes brightened the
door was opened invitingly and he walked
in a middle-aged man with a hook-nose
leaned over a showcase looked over a pair
of brass-rimmed spectacles

  what is it son
with pistol and second reader



  whar does the king live david asked

  the king which king jim king
or george king or hennery look here
you little ragamuffin you aint tryin to
saw me are you if you are by jupiter
ill smack your jaws for you

  the tailor walked around the showcase
david stared and he was a little white
perhaps the tailor had dyspepsia anyway
he was sour enough for vinegar he caught
the faley by the ear and the next moment
he was looking into the one black eye of a
pistol-barrel

  turn it loose snapped david and the
other obeyed with an alacrity that was
ludicrous

  police yelled the frightened hook-
nosed man

  police what was that david won-
dered

  and in another moment he knew a long
arm in a blue sleeve shot over his shoulder
the pistol was seized and wrenched from
his grip a heavy hand caught him by the
collar of his dirty cotton shirt and dragged
him roughly to the sidewalk david twist-
ed half-around looked upward and saw a
face that was leering and brutish

  the faley struck that face with his brown
little fist struck it as hard as he could
strike and he had the sweet satisfaction
of seeing a crimson fluid that was not red
ink start from the policemans nose
quickly the officer pocketed ironhead bill
faleys revolver and caught the boys
wrists in both hands and it hurt david
went paler but not a sound escaped his lips
nor did a tear come to his eyes it had long
been his boast that nobody had ever been
able to make him cry

  youll come wi me growled the police-
man and he jerked the boy clear of the
sidewalk

  then a strong lean hand dropped on the
officers shoulder from behind and he halted
as suddenly as though he had been shot

  david heard a voice saying sharply

  if you feel that youve got to manhandle
somebody sayler try manhandling me
you must treat the kid white sayler
understand

the boy looked upward and
around he saw a tall and lean
keen-eyed smooth-faced man of
about twenty-seven a man who wore a
broad-brimmed black hat a perfectly white

shirt and collar a black string-tie a black
suit of clothes and a pair of expensive
spanish boots he had been riding

  ill have to take him before judge bliss
lew sayler said quite meekly he had
a gun and he tried to shoot tom larkin

  lew tannehill real eastern tennessee
aristocrat looked down at the lad with an
amused half-whimsical smile david faley
returned his gaze without a sign of flinching

  yes tannehill agreed youll have to
do that

  a crowd had gathered of course and this
crowd followed johnsvilles chief of police
and only policeman and his youthful pris-
oner to the magistrates office tannehill
was among them in fact he led them

  old walter bliss had been a circuit-court
judge for more years than he had toes and
they still called him judge bliss now he
was an attorney a real-estate dealer and a
magistrate he was big and bald and very
near-sighted as the crowd began to file
into his office he adjusted his glasses and
wheeled in his desk chair

  well sayler whats this

  sayler halted the boy at the railing that
stood between him and johnsvilles magis-
trate surrendered the pistol that had been
the pride of bill faleys heart and told
all he knew of the attempted assault
tom larkin bore out the policemans state-
ment a sort of trial was held and david
was asked many questions concerning him-
self through it all lew tannehill took
the juvenile prisoners part he pleaded
the boys case with a moving eloqubnce
that seemed as natural with him as to
breathe

  judge bliss listened attentively to this
it was easy to see that he had no love what-
ever for tannehill but he was courteous
if cold the bare truth of the matter was
that he hated tannehill and was too well-
bred to show it walter bliss too was a
real tennessee aristocrat

  the magistrate was in a quandary he
was unaccustomed to being called upon to
decide cases such as this he glanced to-
ward tannehill as though he would ask
advice then he caught himself changed
his glance to an icy stare and shifted it
quickly

  ill vouch for the boy said tannehill
i need a boy in my office and ill give him
the place as for the legal side of it sir
i think this is a thing that might be left


adventure

entirely to the discretion of the court
though you understand sir im not trying
to advise you

  very well lewis bliss replied bluntly
very well you take charge of him and
ill expect you to see that he behaves him-
self

  tannehill took the boys arm and smiled
down at him

  lets go son its all right

  ill not go without my gun protested
david it was my daddys

  but it will be safe here tannehill
assured him its too heavy to lug
around and its unlawful so lets just
leave it with the judge hell take good care
of it

  certainly sir certainly said judge
bliss

  the faley permitted himself to be led
out to the street down the street half the
length of a city block up-stairs and into
an office room over the drug-store there
he halted and looked around him he saw
books by the hundred a table littered with
newspapers chairs a rolltop desk pictures
on the wall on the door which stood
open he spelled out words that told him
that his big friend was a lawyer

  then he turned his serious brown eyes
upon the eyes of tannehill he was disap-
pointed hurt

  so youre a liar he muttered and i
shore did like you

  most all men are liars laughed tanne-
hill at one time or another

  the faleys wasnt said david i
aint

  well pass it why did you ask larkin
where the king lived where did you get
that king idea

  out came the old second reader david
had not mentioned it during his trial if
they took his gun mightnt they also
take his story-book the two sat down
and david read to tannehill the story of
the tailor and the king

  thats whar i got it he said tri-
umphantly when he had finished

  at first tannehill was inclined to laugh
then he began to look thoughtful and a full
understanding came poor little boy he
hated to break that pretty dream far too
many of the dreams of the worlds dreamers
had been broken already he thought of
the time never to be forgotten when he
had learned the truth about santa claus

suddenly he bent forward and took one of
david faleys dirty little hands and
pressed it

  son he said by coming to johnsville
youve won something and lost something
what youve won the future only can show
you what youve lost-i swear id
rather take a horsewhipping than to tell
you lad but there are no kings and queens
no knights and ladies no princes and prin-
cesses like those in that book those
are-well they are just story-people dont
you see

  a long talk followed and it hurt them
both david saw and he believed at last
it was noontime when it was over the
boy half-sick with disillusionment went
with his friend toward the great old brick
home of the tannehills for dinner

  it was on this little journey that david
first saw the girl she was about twenty-
four tall and exceedingly pretty she had
blue eyes and hair that was only a trifle
darker than the color of old-gold when
she saw tannehill she blushed and tanne-
hill whispered as he passed her

  four oclock daisies

  whos that asked david a moment
later

  the answer came readily

  judge bliss daughter miss cordelia
shes purtiern a speckled pup said
david do you like her mr lew

  mr lew looked down at him and mr
lews countenance was serious

  you bet he said you bet i like
her

  a tall and bearded old man an old woman
in a lacy black dress and a very good-
looking young woman in white ate dinner
with them the three were young tanne-
hills father mother and sister and they
were exceptionally kind to david they
were eager to help lew in making out a list
of the new clothing the little mountaineer
would need

  when the meal was over david turned
to old tannehill with this

  you look like my grampaw youve
got a white beard like him my grampaw
was a fine man he died with a rifle in his
hands and the barrel was red-hot he died
on his feet a cussin the wansleys mr
lew he said i was a goin to live here for
the present ef id be a good boy im a
goin to be a good boy shore can i call
you grampaw 
with pistol and second reader



  george tannehill seemed at a loss to
know just what to say finally he an-
swered-

  you may call me grandpa whenever
you like david

  there were many times afterward when
he thought of the incident and always he
was glad that he had granted the first wish
that the boy expressed for the two were
thicker than beans in a bag long before a
frost fell

the summer ran on and johns-
ville came to know the faley as
the tannehill boy and the latter
half of august came then it was that
david learned the secret two secrets to
be exact

  on a warm sunday afternoon when old
mr tannehill was asleep and old mrs
tannehill was visiting the ministers wife
and miss anna had company in the parlor
and he couldnt locate mr lew-david
strolled down to the creek and followed it
out of town suddenly he rounded a short
bend in the brush-lined stream and found
himself facing a pretty little dell filled with
daisies and in that dell stood lew tanne-
hill and judge bliss daughter-and they
looked as tragic as a pair of professional
shakespearean actors in the last act
tannehill stood with the girls hands in his
and the girls eyes were turned downward
and both of them were bareheaded

  since tannehills back was turned upon
david and the girl was looking toward her
feet neither knew of the boys presence
near by miss cordelia began to speak in
a low voice

  its useless lew she said sadly and
its so very painful for four years its
been like this there is utterly no hope
that well ever be able to marry lew we
mustnt love ourselves more than we love
our-our fathers and mothers im con-
vinced that wed better-quit ill promise
you that ill never marry anybody

  david saw lew bend forward and kiss
miss cordelia on the forehead

  not that delia said he not an
eternal good-by

  but father and mother are getting old
the young woman went on and some day
theyre going to find out that ive been
slyly meeting you for four years and then
-lew lew i dont think i could bear it
and they are so very kind to me theyre

always giving me pretty things and costly
things only yesterday father gave me a
milk-white saddler that came from ken-
tucky-oh such a beautiful horse

  let me say here parenthetically that this
fine saddle-horse had been known by its
blue grass keeper as the white satan
and that its latest buyer was entirely un-
acquainted with its record that judge
walter bliss knew of his daughters secret
meetings with lew tannehill and that he
was trying to win his daughter back by
means of overpowering kindliness in massed
formation hence the pretty things and
the costly things and the success he was
having was proof that old walter bliss
was no stranger to the ways of human
nature

  i saw it said tannehill and it
really is a superb animal but theres some
fire in its eyes yet and it ought to be better
broken before you ride it as to our
quitting-perhaps you are right delia
ill leave it to you but i hate the thought
of it it makes the whole world look blue

  all at once david faley realized that he
was doing a most ungentlemanly thing in
eavesdropping like that he stole back
down the creek a hundred yards took off
his shoes and stockings and plunged into
the shallow water to wade

  half an hour and lew tannehill came
down the creek he carried his hat in his
hand and he seemed very gloomy at a
point opposite david he halted and the
lad waded out

  mr lew began the boy i heerd part
o what you and miss cordelie said back
thar i couldnt hardly help it and ever
sence i heerd it ive been busy wonderin
-why caint you and her marry

  he had not lost much of his musical hill-
drawl tannehill smiled a little and that
little whimsically and kicked a stone
into the creek as though it had offended
him

  dont you know son he said after a
silent minute but i guess you dont
it isnt talked of much her father and my
father dislike each other a great deal its
been like that for years and years i can
easily remember the time when they fought
like wildcats on bare sight of each other
its queer too for they spent their child-
hood boyhood and the early part of their
manhood as the most inseparable of friends
they went fishing hunting swimming did


adventure

everything together where one was there
was the other then came the quarrel and
nobody seems to remember what it was
about

  he couldnt understand when he had
finished why he had told the lad perhaps
it was his desperation that had done it
for just that afternoon he and cordelia
bliss had said what they believed was good-
by for all time

  why dont they git up a feud frowned
david and use guns and pistols and have
it out thats the way the wansleys and
faleys-i mean the faleys and wansleys
-done when they got mad

  and you see how it ended dont you
  davids gaze fell

  youre right yes i see makin
friends o yore pap and hern would take
off all o the trouble wouldnt it aint
the no way to make em friends

  no way on earth and tannehill shook
his head youd as well try to stop the
sun

  as they went toward home the little
mountaineer was thoughtful he was try-
ing to think of some plan by which he him-
self could unite the two old belligerents
it was going to be a big job he told himself
if mr lew had found it as impossible as to
stop the sun what could he do

  but he didnt give up he owed lew
tannehill too much to give up

  now if the boy faley was anything he
was cunning and resourceful  he had
had to be that in order to survive in the
maelstrom of adverse forces that had been
in his environment from the day almost
of his birth and he had inherited cunning
and resourcefulness from a long line of
fighting ancestors he was not a very
great while in thinking of a scheme that
offered some promise

  but-could he bring himself to do the
thing

  the difficulty with it was that he would
have to go back on the religion of his people
go back on it squarely david thought
over the matter day after day lay in his
bed and thought over it night after night
it eventually boiled itself down to this in
the bottom of the crucible

  do i love my own lowdown self moren
i love mr lew and miss cordelie

  then quickly in the old stern language
of his fathers-

   ef i go to hell for it ill try it

i l on the next sunday afternoon
lininfra walter bliss took a thick book from
 his library went to a corner of his
broad and shady veranda and ensconced
his huge figure comfortably in a wide wicker
rocker he had no more than opened the
book and adjusted his glasses when there
was the sound of light footfalls on the floor
at his right and he turned his white head
to see the tannehill boy

  i jest thought id come over to see ye
grinned david i alius did like you
mr-judge bliss i aint never forgot
you i reckon youve kept my daddys
pistol good

  old bliss laughed closed the book on his
knees and put his feet on the veranda
railing

  theres a chair sit down he nodded
yes ive taken good care of the revolver
im glad you came son of course but its
a nine-days wonder the tannehills would
let you

  davids heart beat faster as he accepted
the chair now was his golden chance

  they said it was all right with them
replied david old mr tannehill he
told me you was the best man in this end o
the state he said hed give a laig clean
to the hip-jint ef he could be a boy with you
agin and go a fishin and a swimmin and
a huntin with you oncet more he said-
he told grammaw tannehill-ef he died
afore he got to shake hands with you and
be friends hed die mighty bad onsatisfied
and last night when he held fambly prayers
he shore axed the lord to remember you
and every single one o yore folks

  thus did a faley and the last of the
faleys lie

  judge bliss took his feet off the veranda
railing and sat up straight in the wickcr
rocker his eyes flashed into the eyes of the
boy and the boy did not look away

which-which mr tannehill he
floundered george tannehill but-
yes yes son he didnt say that did he
he shore did bravely cross my
heart and hope to die ef he didnt

  the youthful diplomat and liar and hero
thought it best to change the subject and
he did they talked on about a number of
things but the father of miss cordelia
seemed to want to think rather than to
talk and david left him to himself

  david found tannehill the elder sitting
alone in his study poring over an ancient
with pistol and second reader



 law book he stole up behind the gray
 old man slipped his hands around and
 pushed the obstructing spectacles gently
 upward and covered the dim eyes with the
 tips of his fingers

 guess he said mischievously lovingly
 delightedly

 george tannehill winked at himself so
 to speak

 lew he said

 guess agin

 fanny

 agin snickered the lad

 mother

 haw haw agin

 oh then it must be david

 that time you got er laughed david
 he sat himself down on old tannehills
 knee they were first-rate pals now

 you guessed who i was grampaw
 he went on see ef ye can guess whar ive
 been to

  im afraid i cant

 blisses grampaw

 what bliss tannehill was dis-
 pleased

 did you keer

 with half the air of having disowned him
 george tannehill deliberately placed the
 boy on a near-by chair then he bent
 toward david and his bearded face was
 serious and his eyes were narrowed david
 took a fresh hold on himself this was going
 to be the middle of the bridge for him
 did any of the blisses say anything
 about me tannehill demanded

 ironhead bill faleys son seemed to be
 trying to remember

 les see grampaw what was it he
 did say about you oh yes-i got it now
 judge bliss he told me you and him were
 boys together he said him and you used
 to go a swimmin and a fishin and a huntin
 together he said hed give a million
 dollars for jest one o them old happy days
 with you and he said ef he died afore he
 got to shake hands with you and be friends
 hed die mighty bad onsatisfied then he
 took out his hankercheef and cried awful
 pitiful

 george tannehill was not what one could
 call gullible for a long minute he bored
 his gaze into the countenance of the boy
 trying to search out some sign of falsehood
 but david faced him steadfastly

  son finally asked tannehill honestly
  did walter bliss say that

  thes one thing a faley never done
grampaw quietly convincingly and
thats tell a lie

  it was his last card and the playing of it
wrung his heart

  my little david suddenly said the old
man very gently i beg your pardon most
humbly

  he rose and the other watched him
he went to his bedroom put on a fresh shirt
and collar and tie and combed his hair very
carefully then he found his hat and cane
and set out for the home of the blisses
david filled with misgiving followed some
fifty feet behind him to hear and to see

  it wasnt far to the home of the blisses
and tannehills cane soon stepped off the
little distance the old ex-judge was
standing at the gate he was looking for
his daughter who had gone horseback-
riding more than two hours before tanne-
hill walked up and put out his hand and
bliss gripped it unhesitatingly they shook
with a great heartiness and their chins
quivered david crept a few yards closer
and listened-and that which he heard was
like a bullet to him

  the boy was telling me began tanne-
hill that you said-that youd like to be

friends again with me i-im sure i-

  i never said any such thing exploded
walter bliss stiffening the boy told
me-

  the boy wheeled and ran the greatest
sacrifice he had been able to make for his
mr lew a sacrifice greater than to die
had been for nothing less than nothing
the tannehills would turn him out and he
would be a ragamuffin and an outcast again
with not a soul to love him he had never
been so badly hurt so nearly crushed
before but he didnt cry about it no-
body had ever been able to make him cry
he had that at least left to him

  when he had gone fifty yards he halted
and looked back the two old men were
talking in angry tones and standing as
straight as a pair of pine trees he had
made matters even worse-they were going
to fight

then the rapid ringing sounds of
hoofbeats came to his ears and he
faced the other way he saw that
beautiful white horse of miss cordelias
coming wildly up the street with its head
in the air and foam flying from its nostrils-


adventure

and miss cordelia was on its back and
clinging desperately to the old-fashioned
side-saddle she was as pale as death too
badly frightened to even cry out

  the faley didnt stop to think there
wasnt time anyway he had a hazy wish
that he might die and save the girl as he
dashed for the middle of the street as the
horse was about to pass him he made a leap
for its head and caught the reins at the bit
in both hands and held on grimly

  a leg splintered under an ironshod hoof
a loose nail in another hoof gashed his other
leg again and again he was lifted into the
air and dashed to die stones by that mad
white satan of a horse-still he held on
held on and the horse tired of that dead
weight that it couldnt shake off slowed
down groaned despairingly and stopped
squarely in front of judge bliss and old
george tannehill

  miss cordelia got to the ground somehow
and ran to the boy the two old men
themselves and their differences forgotten
reached the faley at the same time
though he seemed to know nothing the
lads hands were set so tightly on the
leathern straps that they had to be pried
open one finger after another while the
horses eyes blazed with threats of more
devilment a dozen neighbors among
them a doctor and johnsvilles policeman
ran up the doctor gathered the limp
little body which was now wholly in-
sensible into his arms

  take him into my house judge bliss
ordered crisply

  before he followed walter bliss calmly
borrowed a revolver from policeman sayler
and shot the white satan squarely through
the brain

  so vicious a horse he said deserves
it

  amen solemnly growled old george
tannehill

  when david faley came to it was late
at night he was in a bed that was like
his own and yet was not his own the
electric droplight was shaded with half a
newspaper he tried to move his legs
one of them hurt and the other was numb
and like wood doctor rankin stepped
out of the gloom and tannehills and
blisses followed him

  grampaw cried the faley and the
man he had addressed bowed his head and
went back stumbling as he went

  lie still son said the doctor with a
smile that wasnt altogether professional
youll soon be all right

  david went to sleep at sundown of
the following day he awoke to find his mind
clear of the effects of ether standing over
him were miss cordelia and lew tannehill
and by their faces he knew that they were
not unhappy

  you did a good job of it after all
david said lew you see we figured
it all out the old gentlemen are the
tightest friends in the state and delia and
i are going to be married next month
and were going to adopt you on the same
day

  david smiled

  well im glad glad for you folks and
glad for myself he drawled in the old
drawl of the hills and im g-glad i

li-li-lied like i d-d-done-

  sniff-sniff at last at last

  after a moment calmly

  mr lew the fust chanst ye have

i	wisht yed bring me my second reader
which yell find on the table in my room
you said the wasnt no people like them
in that book no more but-but for me thes
alius got to be one king anyways and one
queen

  at which a young woman with blue eyes
and hair a little darker than the color of old-
gold stooped to kiss him
 the first part of the story quickly retold in story form

ahat roared sir william berkeley governor
of virginia five hundred pounds less than
last year

  five hundred and sixty-two pounds six shillings
your excellency replied his secretary

  there were more traders asked the governor
  two more your excellency

  weve killed off none of the savages has less
fur been taken or have we not received it

  there is no reason your excellency to believe
that the savages have taken less they are eager
enough for the goods

  have the warden of the gaol conduct that
disgraceful son of captain jeffreys before me at
once commanded the governor

   your life is at stake began sir william address-
ing richard jeffreys

  you have been in gaol under charges of failure to
attend church blasphemy failure to plant corn
illicit trade with the indians smuggling furs and
seditious utterances there is proof enough to
hang you three times over but there is a reason i
have for bringing you here they tell me you have
been to the blue mountains

  yes and beyond answered dick

  then there is hope for you said sir william
the king needs you our fur business must be
controlled as the king would have it unlicensed
traders are visiting the indians the dutch are
smuggling a man must go among the indians
win them must catch these outlaw traders and
bring information that will permit us to apprehend
them take an oath of allegiance to the king mend
your ways and captain jeffreys son may live to be
a credit to him and to his king you may have three
hours in which to decide

  the door was opened and richard jeffreys was
led back to the gaol

  once more dick stood before the governor
  well demanded sir william

   tell you governor berkeley you and your

kind have come to the wrong land i know that

god set aside this land for men not kings for the
rule of right and justice and before a hundred
years have passed men will rule this land

  the governors face turned purple with rage

  does the noose have to tighten about your neck
before you come to your senses and acknowledge
the king and abandon your wild ideas your seditious
utterances asked sir william

  a moment later and dicks hands reached out
one grasped his excellencys throat the other
closed his mouth and bent back his head

  not a move or your breast will sheathe your
dagger whispered jeffreys

  binding the governors hands and mouth dick
sprang out the window after two hours of pad-
dling he drew in to shore at a clump of sycamores

  dick how did you get away asked elizabeth
carver

  dick explained the result of his interview with
sir william berkeley

  suddenly the girl grasped his arm they listened
the sound of pounding hoofs on the road was
heard

  your pursuers have cut you off she cried
there is a way to escape back of the tobacco-
sheds is a cabin go there ill see that you get
food and water

  dick jeffreys was in the region of the great
lakes months had passed since he left virginia
standing by a river he saw an approaching canoe
in the craft were basile pombert leon la gard and
michel charon french eoureurs de bois they
stopped at the bank at dicks feet he stepped
into the canoe

  rowing down the river they reached the village
of the islinois indians with whom the eoureurs de
bois desired to trade

  the canoes were unloaded and the exchange of
knives muskets trinkets and brandy for buffalo
and beaver-skins was begun

chapter vi

the machinations of basile

ith night came to the peaceful
 village of the islinois scenes un-
f dreamed of even in the fiercest
passions of savage warfare a
huge fire blazed high in the space between
the row of brush and grass cabins and the
river bank where the frenchmen had
landed and around this shrieking reeling
their naked bodies glistening with perspira-
tion in the firelight circled the warriors of
the band

  basile-cool calculating with an eye for
everything and every one poured brandy
into the greedily extended gourds but never
until leon or michel had first received a
bundle of furs and always with an impar-
tiality that would result in no warrior es-
caping the enfiaming consequences of the
debauch basile wanted no laggards no
half-sober savages and so unerringly did he
estimate the effects of the liquor on each
one so skilfully did he apportion the
brandy each man and youth in the village
moved forward to the successive stages of
drunkenness as uniformly as troops maneu-
ver on a parade-ground

  the savages danced and yelled about the
fire they still contained control of their
bodies though their brains were scorched
constantly men broke away rushed into
the darkness and returned with fresh
bundles of furs which they tossed at ba-
siles feet before extending their gourds
the brandy was downed at a gulp and
freshly inflamed they whirled away into the
slirieking circle

   except in isolated instances of insolent at-
tempts to compel larger portions the white
men were not molested basile had clev-
erly implanted the idea in their minds at the
beginning that fur would always bring
brandy and nothing else and automatic-
ally as the effects wore off as more stimu-
lant was desired the savages rushed away
for new bundles of pelts

  dick jeffreys though in full view of the
orgy had little time to note the details of
the trading as fast as the fur was re-
ceived the brandy doled out leon and
michel tossed the skins back to him to be
tied into bundles and piled on the river
bank close to the canoes

it was not the demoralization of the war-

riors or even the possible danger to the four
white men should the savages get beyond
control that occupied dicks mind as he
worked rapidly over his bales brandy he
knew had always been an accessory to the
fur trade the savages had come to ex-
pect it and perhaps after all there was no
harm done in thus transporting them into a
new world in furnishing high lights they
could not otherwise hope for surely noth-
ing had happened so far that could be ob-
jected to even the huge price paid for the
liquor there was no other brandy within
a hundred leagues or more and everywhere
supply and demand govern price

  but it was in the attitude of michel when
they had transported the weapons across
the river in the cold scheming actions of
basile in a dread of something far worse for
which he could find no tangible grounds
that dick had his misgivings as he
pondered over this his eyes spared from his
work as much as possible a change came
as he turned toward the river laden with fur
basile looked at the shrieking circle of war-
riors and then glanced at michel and leon

  now michel whispered here is the
chief himself

  the leader of the savages his legs becom-
ing uncertain in their movements thrust
himself forward and tossed a bundle of
beaver skins at the feet of the white men
at the same time his gourd waved uncer-
tainly toward the cask

  you are not generous basile told him
with a smile have not your women
scraped these skins have they not
planted the maize have they not cared
for the meat when you have killed it
why then should they not share in your
rejoicing

  the chiefs eyes narrowed as he digested
this idea and they glinted selfishly

  just a drink half a gourd for your
wives continued basile they have
earned it come be generous as befits
a great chief

  several other indians had come up to
calmor for more drink and they had heard
one seemed to find amusement in the idea
and yelled his approval but before he
could hand his gourd forward the chief
not to be outdone demanded a full dipper
for the women of his family as basile
filled it more generously than ever before
the chief turned and called the names of his
women
before marquette



  every woman and child in the village
had been present at the carousal sitting in
a circle outside the dancers adding to the
tumult the women even begging some-
times for a little of the elixir which seemed
so to exalt the men as the chief called
out three women arose one tumbling a
child from her lap and ran forward the
chief passed the gourd to them and amid
much giggling coughing sputtering and
gibes from the others the liquor was
downed

  the warriors immediately clamored for
brandy for their women and in a moment
basile was doling out the fiery stuff faster
than before half an hour later every
woman in the circle was as intoxicated as
the men and joining in the dance they out-
stripped the braves with their shrill screams
and contortions

  with the advent of the women the char-
acter of the orgy began to change swiftly
the crowd of dancers about the fire was
more dense one brave stepped on an-
others feet and was knocked down he
arose pulled a burning stick from the fire
and struck his adversary across the face
blinding him and sending him reeling
through the blaze

  the encounter pleased the crowd and at
the same time aroused a desire for conflict
several fights started two men wrestled
impotently for a time a yelping circle of
demons about them then one with a
snap like that of a fear-maddened beast
bit off the others nose

  a woman shrieking hysterically pulled a
burning stick from the fire and held it
across the bare back of a dancing warrior
he cried in agony and then whirled and
thrust the woman into the fire where she
stumbled and fell and then rushed out from
the other side her hair a blazing torch

  on every side personal encounters
started without weapons unable to strike
or wrestle effectively the savages resorted
to snapping and tearing with their teeth
noses and ears were bitten off chunks of
flesh were ripped from backs and breasts
and shoulders blood flowed down the
bare bodies of the men and soaked the
scanty skifa garments of the women

  one woman suddenly ran from the circle
snatched up a sleeping infant from the arms
of an older child and with a fiendish shriek
hurled it into the center of the flames
the little body writhed for a few moments

its skin scorched and crinkled then it lay
quite still

  dick stupefied by the horror of the
scene did not realize for a time that no
more furs were forthcoming though the
gourds were kept full basile was assisted
in the dispensation by both leon and
michel all three worked swiftly their
faces alight in anticipation seemingly
oblivious of the horror about them

  at last basile rolled out a cask knocked
in the head and waved the savages toward
it there was a scramble immediately
the clattering of gourds drowned out by
yells and screams fights were started
everywhere blood flowed to the accom-
paniment of shrieks of anguish men and
women reeled and weaved about aimlessly
some swayed and fell to lie motionless
completely overcome or to struggle vainly
to rise one warrior stumbled and plunged
down the bank falling with his head and
shoulders in the water his feet kicked for
a time but his body only slid farther in the
mud and at last it disappeared without
leaving a ripple on the water

  come dick cried leon the time
has arrived be quick

  he dashed off after michel and basile
but the virginian sickened by the events
of the evening comparing the bestial crea-
tures before his eyes with the happy con-
tented smiling friendly people he had
seen only a few hours before remained
where he stood too stunned even to com-
prehend the reality of this complete and
wanton degradation

as he watched the very horror
of the scene began to compel
a realization of the crime in which
he had had a part his paralysis became
that of enervating disgust and repulsion of
self-accusation and remorse

  come you english fool cried basile
from behind him get into the cabins at
once we must be away soon

  dick whirled to see the frenchmans evil
face scowling at him from above a heap of
trade-goods with which his arms were laden
basile dumped his burden down on the
bank beside the furs and again faced
dick

  you beast cried the virginian stung
at last to action by the realization that his
companions were about to terminate their
visit by stealing all they had traded by


adventure

robbing these unsuspecting friendly chil-
dren not only of their innocence but even of
the very price of it

  he leaped forward and struck basile in
the face with all his strength the french-
man reeled against a savage and then
cursing hysterically sprang back to meet
the attack dick stepped to one side and
again his fist found basiles face at the
same instant a stick of wood thrown by a
drunken warrior sent the virginian reeling
down the bank beside the frenchman

  basile met him not with a blow but with
a steadying arm

 watch he commanded the sav-
ages have turned upon us leon michel
dick whirled at basiles side to see a
group of shrieking warriors charging down
upon them led by the one against whom
basile had fallen and who had struck dick in
retaliation

  your fists advised basile strike
quick and hard and dont let them get their
arms about you

  side by side he and dick met the charge
of the reeling crazed savages two went
down then a third but others took their
places and the white men to evade the
clutching arms and gleaming teeth would
have been forced back into the river had
not michel and leon charged into them
with swinging muskets

  no more than a dozen indians had taken
part in the attack the others apparently
uninterested still circled about the fire

  ill attend to you later english dog
basile whispered in dicks ear as he turned
away to follow leon and michel to the
cabins and fresh plundering

  the frenchmen left dick standing above
the bodies of the savages they load knocked
senseless instinctively he started after
the coureurs dc bois and then his utter help-
lessness in the face of all that had hap-
pened broght him up with a start

  the indians were mad with liquor past
control past help of any kind once they
had recovered once they learned all that
had been done to them their desire for
vengeance would be boundless now the
damage had been done dick could only
hope to escape with the frenchmen and
settle with basile afterward 

  to rid himself at least of the sight of this
rape of an innocent people the virginian
started down the bank of the river seeking
the darkness beyond the circle of the fire

he stumbled blindly on among some
bushes stopping only when he heard a low
cry and sounds of a struggle in front of him
at the same instant a warrior applied a
torch to the grass roof of a cabin and the
whole village was lighted instantly

  the first rays disclosed to dick a young
girl struggling in the arms of basile the
frenchmans face was red from her
scratches but he only laughed and held her
more tightly

  instantly dick was upon him striking
tearing at his arms beating his face and
head and shoulders basile dropped the
girl with a curse and reached for his knife
as it slipped from his belt dick swung with
all his strength and his fist met the french-
mans jaw he dropped silently into the
grass

  dick turned to find the girl watching him
in wonder

  when you played with my little brother
today she began suddenly i knew you
were not like the others now you have
saved me so i shall tell you something to
save you my father once journeyed far to
the north to a great lake your people call
superior he saw frenchmen there like
yourselves and he saw them give brandy
to our people today he would not taste of
it nor would he let me and when you began
to give brandy to us he went down the river
to tell the warriors of the next village
they come soon and then there will be
stakes and pine splinters for all of you

  the seriousness of her manner had com-
manded dicks attention and although he
had been unable to comprehend all of her
speech he had grasped enough of it to have
a clear idea of her meaning

  you say he asked that your father
will lead the warriors against us

  for answer she held up her hand

  listen she said simply

  a single war-whoop sounded from down
the river a cry stabbing through the dark-
ness and the dying clamor about the fire
instantly dick stooped and lifted basiles
limp body with a struggle he swung it to
his shoulder and set off along the bank
toward the canoes

  leon michel he cried as he stag-
gered beneath his burden quick or we
are lost

  as he came to the dance-fire the two
frenchmen their arms full of loot rushed
down to the canoes
before marquette



  quick dick commanded to your
paddles the warriors of the next village
are here

  what of it demanded leon well
get them drunk too

  but they have been warned by one from
this village one who would not drink and
they have been told that we robbed and
killed after making them mad its the
stake for all of us

  nonsense michel retorted there
is-

  his words were drowned by a yell from the
edge of the village that froze all three for an
instant then as one man they turned to
the canoe into which dick had dumped
basile threw in their muskets and leaped
after them dick in the bow michel in the
stern leon kneeling astride his uncon-
scious companion they paddled as they had
never paddled before

  but before they had pulled away from the
light of the burning cabin dick looked over
his shoulder to see a stream of naked war-
riors flow through the circle about the fire
there was a yell shrill high above the bed-
lam of the camp echoing like the staccato
cry of the wolf that snaps at the haunches
of a deer a glistening arm pointed toward
the shadow of the fleeing canoe and the
next instant arrows rained on the water
about it

chapter vii

hidden enemies

the islinois river was too wide for
effective archery and the canoe was
turned toward the opposite bank where
blending with the shadows it sped on up-
stream unseen by the savages and un-
heard for the paddles dipped noiselessly

  all three men knew however that this
did not mean safety down-stream they
might have out-distanced their pursuers
only to put leagues of hostile territory
between them and lac mecheygan up-
stream following the many convolutions
of the river fighting the current there was
no hope of escape after daylight came
knowing each bend each shallow place
where they could ford or swam the savages
could easily strike across country and cut
them off at dawn to abandon the canoe
would be equally fatal for every foot of
both banks would be examined in the first
light of the new day

   for the present in the darkness and with
the river between them and the savages
they were safe a few of the islinois had
attempted to follow in the canoe left behind
but their unfamiliarity with the craft per-
mitted the eoureurs de bois to out-distance
them easily the three men drove ahead
with all their strength they could hear
their pursuers on the opposite bank and
sometimes an arrow plumped into the water
near them but the stream was straight
and broad and with little current for sev-
eral leagues and after an hour there were
no sounds of the indians

   basile recovered consciousness at last and
attempted to rise

  lie still whispered leon as he laid
aside his paddle and placed both hands on
basiles shoulders dont speak above a
whisper the savages pursue us when
you feel able to sit up your blade will be
welcome

  if i am needed was the answer i
am well able to paddle now there are no
broken bones i only lost all knowledge
of life for a time where is that dog of an
englishman

  he is here ahead twas he that car-
ried you to the canoe else you would even
now be wearing pine splinters never
mind him for the present it needs the
strength and skill of all four to escape the
shrieking devils on the bank it is the stake
for all of us if we are caught use your
blade now and settle your quarrels later
very well said basile as he arose cau-
tiously to his knees give me a paddle

i	can wait

  well said leon encouraged now
to work for another league then we can
stop for breath and perhaps a plan

  all four now bent to their work and the
canoe was fairly lifted from the water as
the paddles went into the stream in perfect
unison they sped on faster than the
indians could run on land and after half
an hour michel called a halt in the shadow of
a small heavily wooded island in midriver

  i have no breath left he gasped as he
took hold of a willow branch to anchor the
canoe we cant keep that up for long
and there are several big bends beyond
by morning they will surely be ahead
and if we did outstrip them we would
only run into the miamis who would treat
us no better said leon

  i have a plan whispered dick as he


adventure

turned in the bow a quarter of a league
above us a stream comes in from the left
it is large enough for the canoe so large
it must come from some distance i re-
member it because michel and i stopped
to shoot a deer just above it before we
camped at the place where we first saw the
islinois

  the savages are on that bank and can
follow it easily sneered basile we
would only be running into them

  no it is our only chance declared
dick ahead the river makes a turn to
the right and then almost doubles back
upon itself it is at the upper end of that
big bend that they will hope to be in ahead
of us at daylight they will not believe
that we would turn off and let them get
between us and lac mecheygan if we
hurry now and go up this small stream
before they come to it we can leave them
behind and without a trace of the direction
we have taken and without a suspicion
that we are not ahead from the head-
waters of this stream we can surely reach
some place of safety to the north

  monsieur dick is right agreed michel
enthusiastically the canoe leaves no
trace we can turn up this stream for
many leagues and who knows but that we
may cross over to the rocky river that
comes down from near the land of the
puans or ouinibegous a mascouten once
told me that the rocky river flowed down
along the border of the islinois country and
at last entered the misisepe

  it is our only chance said leon
come let us be on the way to this
stream before they reach it

  but how do we know we will reach this
rocky river objected basile

  even if we dont it is better than let-
ting these devils burn us at the stake as
they will before another night if we are not on
our way retorted michel monsieur dick
is right it is the only thing we can do
again the canoe was shot swiftly up-
stream and in a few minutes dick signaled
from the bow that they were opposite the
mouth of the river flowing in from the
north for a moment they listened intently
but there was no sign of life on either shore

paddle whispered michel its a
chance but one we should be glad to take
silently cautiously each mans nerves
taut the canoe was driven close to the
north bank alone on the water it could

be seen easily from the shore yet there
were no savage yells no arrows dropping
about them

  we are in time whispered leon we
have headed them come up this stream
before they do suspect us

  the canoe stole into the shadows of the
trees bordering the smaller river as if into
a tunnel and the silent paddles shot it on
through the darkness for an hour they
continued the tension growing less until
when they came to a wide open marsh
through which the stream twisted in a long
series of bends and ox-bows there was no
longer fear of immediate pursuit but
none of the men even hoped for safety there
and so long as the night lasted they con-
tinued to paddle

  the first signs of dawn found them five
or six leagues from the islinois river and
out of the big marsh the banks were
higher trees had come again although the
stream was narrower and twisted and
turned until they would have lost all sense
of direction had it not been for the stars

  theres our salvation whispered leon
excitedly as the stream suddenly widened
in a little valley and in the center of the
pond which was about an eighth of a
league across they could see the dark
shadow of a small island well crawl
into the brush on that isle hide the canoe
and sleep until night if they should come
this way after us theyd never find us
there

  there was a ready acceptance of this
proposal as all were near exhaustion be-
fore daylight they and their canoe were
safely hidden and each taking his turn as
look-out they slept until nightfall

again the hours of darkness were
spent in putting more leagues be-
tween them and the islinois river
but not long after midnight they found the
stream had grown so small that further
progress by canoe was impossible

  now we are trapped exclaimed basile
we cant go on without leaving footprints
on the bank even could we hide the canoe
so that they would not find it

  there is still the good chance that they
never suspected our coming this way
objected dick if we land now we need
only strike straight north until we come to
this rocky river of which michel has
heard if we are pursued there is still the
before marquette



possibility of our getting to the rocky
river first when we reach that and the
land of the puans we will be safe

  to be sure agreed michel it is
the only course open to us dick and i
will carry the canoe and you two the mus-
kets we can change each league

  and perhaps carry it a dozen leagues
growled basile

  id carry it a thousand rather than
have those devils on my back declared
leon it is the only way out of the
difficulty so lets be at it

  they were in a country of which white
men knew nothing far off any possible
water route and they were not even cer-
tain that the rocky river existed or that
if it did they could reach it by traveling
north moreover none of the men had
eaten since the night of their flight and so
long as there was danger of pursuit they
could not risk the time for or the noise of
getting game they had fled with only
one canoe their muskets and powder-horns
and ball pouches from which they were never
separated when among strange savages

  the eoureurs de bois were accustomed to
famine as well as to feasting however and
dick would have been the last to complain
of the weakness of hunger the fear of the
vengeance of the ravished islinois was still
with them and all knew the fate that
awaited should they be overtaken

  accordingly as they struck off across the
level prairie in the light of the strs they
forgot their burdens in the desire for this
unknown river each hour they walked a
league and each hour the bearers of the
canoe exchanged their burden for the
scarcely less heavy or awkward and irk-
some muskets and powder-horns

  the agreement they had made for carry-
ing the canoe kept dick and michel to-
gether but the heavy work left little op-
portunity for discussion even had dick
felt that it would be possible to gain mi-
chels support in his quarrel that basile
was allowing no time to elapse before mak-
ing plans for revenge was easily evident in
the manner in which he drew leon ahead
that they might talk without being heard

  there was nothing however the vir-
ginian could do his only chance for safety
lay in remaining with the eoureurs de bois
and so great was the problem that con-
fronted them he put aside his trouble with
basile for future settlement and gave his

  entire attention to searching for signs of
the much desired river x
the country was either flat or rolling
usually treeless once their hunger was
doubled when they encountered a small
herd of buffalo and were compelled to go
on without trying a shot twice their
hopes were aroused when the land dipped
and they were forced to skirt a marsh
but each time higher land came to rob
them of their hopes for a river

  daylight brought them to a forest of
oaks and under their shelter they continued

  not another step will i carry that
beast cried leon when his turn came to
abandon one end of the canoe

  youll only exchange that burden for
the tortures of purgatory declared michel
look at the trail we are leaving those
savages could follow it with their eyes
swathed come on wood usually means
water in this prairie country the liver
may be just beyond

  half an hour more brought them to the
banks of a broad stream and without the
waste of a moment they put it between
them and possible pursuit

  noise or no noise said michel as they
landed on the north side im going to
have a stag for breakfast

  ill go with you said basile as he
picked up his musket two shots are no
louder than one

  dick and leon carried the canoe out of
sight behind some bushes and lay down to
rest in less than an hour the hunters re-
turned with a young buck and the good
news that they had discovered traces of a
recent camp of mascouten hunters

  it means we are in their country and
the islinois will not dare fohow us much
farther said michel we can risk the
smoke of a fire so long as we have chanced
the noise of a shot and then well put a few
more leagues between us and the islinois
they ate the meat when it was little
more than scorched after the meal which
left little of the buck basile took the hide
and inserting his knife in the center began
to cut around and around until he had a
thong half an inch wide and several yards
long silently he handed one end to
michel and passing it back and forth
through the fire they burned off the hair
once or twice during the operation basile
glanced at dick a hard smile on his cruel
mouth


adventure

  now well be going he said when they
had finished we should be a dozen
leagues farther away by night and perhaps
in the village of the mascoutens

  all day they paddled toward the north-
east and not once was there evidence that
they were followed by the islinois be-
cause fear of the savages was still with them
however they paddled swiftly and without
speaking hour after hour they went on
and on silent watchful always swiftly

  even in the silence and despite the
natural cause of it dick began to feel the
presence of a barrier between him and the
other three the hostility of basile was
to be expected and from it he knew that
when safety was certain there would come
a decisive struggle but michel and leon
amiable carefree light-hearted he had
once considered firm friends that his
apparent criticism of their plundering
methods should have lost for him some of
their regard he had no doubt but he had
not expected the complete change in them
that he now felt

  in the first hurried flight from the isli-
nois and the hours of anxious search for the
rocky river this enmity had not been so
evident now the more leagues they put
between them and the aroused savages the
more dick sensed the fact that he was not
only going deeper and deeper into an un-
known land but that he was going alone he
remembered how basile and leon had gone
on ahead how he had overheard their
voices in argument when they made the
long portage in the night he recalled the
alacrity with which basile had joined
michel in the hunt that morning

  but night and a camp on the bank of
the river came before he found a tangible
basis for his suspicions michel wandered
off with his musket as soon as they landed
and returned with another buck and again
with news of a still more recent camp of
mascouten hunters basiles interest was
at once aroused and on one pretext or an-
other he drew first leon and then michel
aside

but still nothing was said noth-
ing was done no mention was made
of the disaster to their plans on the
river of the islinois then after supper
when each had selected a comfortable place
beside the fire basile spoke

 michel leon you will remember

  that on the chicagon i protested against
taking this englishman with us you will
remember that we started from montreal
with the fixed plan of trading among the
islinois and you will remember the hopes
we had for a most successful venture you
will remember too your debts which must
be paid on your return or there is to be no
return

  what has happened this english-
man forced himself upon us with pleasant
words enough but with what actions

  ill back up those actions with words
and the words in turn with more action
interrupted dick angrily as for your
acts basile pombert there are no words
to express the scorn of an honest man for
them

  and he is the man who bragged that
he is an outlaw laughed leon the
one who came to the french country to
gain freedom to escape the law he talks
like a blackrobe

  i came for freedom yes replied dick
his anger increased by leon thus openly
alining himself with basile but i do
not call it freedom to gain the opportunity
to rob to cheat to ravish i sought free-
dom but not a license from satan himself
nor did i seek the arts of the imps of hell
an outlaw i am but a man may flee the
wrath of a king and still be honest still
remember that he is better than the beasts
he should have been a jesuit laughed
basile he should carry the cross not
honest brandy to the pagan savages
would not that pere marquette at michili-
makinac have rejoiced to hear him

  angry as dick was he was not without
caution and in this jeering attitude of
basile he recognized a greater danger than
he had expected the frenchman felt
that he was playing a safe hand that he
was merely testing his power merely whet-
ting his appetite for the enjoyment of the
final victory

  dicks contempt for the man his repul-
sion and his memory still vivid of that
last night on the islinois caused him to
minimize the danger

  call it the cross or what you will he
retorted angrily had i been told basile
what you planned doing to those innocent
people you ravished i would have pre-
vented it even if i had been forced to wring
your serpents neck to accomplish it

  and accomplish it you did son of an
before marquette



english dog cried basile displaying anger
for the first time as i was telling leon
and michel we planned much we hoped to
return to the st lawrence with the where-
withal for a glorious time what has pre-
vented it this english swine forced
himself upon us and then robbed us of our
hard-earned reward his talk is pretty but
his actions are those of a spy as i first said
and that night on the islinois i tell you
he showed his real self i saw him talking
with this girl the one who left these marks
on my face and with her father and he
told them a false story of our being rob-
bers brigands even murderers what
happened this old man warned another
village and here we are penniless fugitives
victims of an english spy

  you lie pombert interrupted dick in
a low voice you lie and you knowyou
lie but i will say this had i known
what you intended had i known how to
prevent what you did i would have taken
any risk to defeat you from the first
you have shown yourself to be a sneak an
ungrateful cur a beast in the shape of a
man but with no other human attributes
i would not try to shame you by reminding
you that had i not carried you to the canoe
you would even now be a shriveled cinder
on an islinois stake i claim no credit for
that it was a selfish act for i was only
saving you for death at my own hands

  the virginian had spoken calmly but in
deadly earnest and as he finished he started
to rise instantly basile rolled across the
ground and grasped him about the knees
leon and michel springing to their feet
threw themselves at dicks shoulders and
waist striking exerting all his strength
to throw them off he went down beneath
them and before he had ceased struggling
the long strip of rawhide basile had cut
held his arms and legs

  the three frenchmen panting wiping
the perspiration from their faces took seats
across the fire from their captive

  now what asked leon

  a big canoe and a full one on our re-
turn to the st lawrence before winter
sets in answered basile

  and you can talk like that without
brandy demanded michel in mock amaze-
ment

  be silent you two with the sheeps
heads commanded basile sternly you
are like horses you can work if well

driven but turned loose in a field how
much could you plow i planned the
most successful endeavor of our lives you
meddled took this english dog along de-
spite my wishes and see what has hap-
pened tell me both of you who of us
has the head who can plan

  you are right basile answered leon
humbly we have been wrong lead
and we will follow anywhere is it not so
michel

  even to this misisepe be it fresh or
salt full of monsters or no was the reply

  then listen said pombert pressing
his advantage and you shall learn how we
shall drift down the st lawrence with a
big canoe and a full one before winter
comes

  we can not go many leagues up this
river without finding the mascoutens
you have heard tell of them they are
warlike but there are not enough of them
to be successful they like prisoners and
the pleasures of the stake but have few
captives they are tricky and they are
vain what do you think would please
them most

  a cask of brandy offered leon

  to be gone in a night no we have
that which they would desire most a white
man for slave for prisoner for torture
do you not see a word or two in the
chiefs ear a story of the english king who
sent a man to take the lands of the mas-
coutens for himself of how if he returns
to his ruler it will be to lead an army into
this peaceful land and slay every savage
we can say that by torturing this prisoner
their young men will become strong and
brave so strong and brave they will be
successful even against the longhouses

  they have never had a white prisoner
it will be easy for us to mold their simple
minds to the belief that torturing one re-
leases to them all the white mans strength
oh no and he grinned across the fire at
dick well make this englishman long
for the noose of his king

  and how does that load the canoe
asked michel

  you fool replied basile must i
even expand your chest so that your lungs
may receive the breath of life for this
great gift to them we will receive a big
canoe and every pelt of every kind in their
village this english devil lost us a years
profits let him repay us


adventure

  the next morning only three paddles
dipped into the waters of the rocky river
in the bottom of the canoe still bound lay
dick jeffreys all night the frenchmen
had taken turns guarding him and now he
was constantly under the eye of all once
in the night he had pleaded with michel
sought to win again the friendship the
courcur de bois had first displayed only to
find that the influence of basile coupled
with the poverty of the trio held full
sway

  at noon they entered a long stretch of
the river with rounded bluffs heavily
wooded on either side at the far end
where the river curved was a flat treeless
expanse and grouped in the center of this
were a score or more of cabines

  the mascoutens cried leon from the
bow

  and see that you leave all the talk to
me cautioned basile i want no bung-
ling here

  for a day the frenchmen feasted with
the savages observing the native custom
of delaying the statement of a visits object
they were given a cabinc in which to keep
their prisoner who was an object of much
curiosity until basile spread the word that
dick was not a frenchman but a devil
from the other side of the stinking water
and always michel or leon were on guard
at the hut at night all three slept there

  when do we begin demanded leon
irritably the second night lets get this
over and be on our way

  tomorrow answered basile i will
hold a talk with the chiefs alone by night
it should all be arranged

  the next forenoon michel and leon re-
mained in the hut while basile went to
confer with the leading men the two
eoureurs de bois settled themselves com-
fortably for a long wait for they knew the
deliberate habits of the savages in dis-
cussion they were wholly unprepared
therefore when their leader returned in a
few minutes and thrust his head into the
low door

  settled so soon cried leon pom-
bert you are capable of being prime minis-
ter to the king were they glad of the
chance to have our friend for the stake
hell burn and to the tune of the
shrieks of his yellow heart was the answer
but something bigger is afoot come and
ill tell you

chapter viii

basile grows ambitious

taick alert for any opportunity but
helpless in the bonds with which he
was tied glanced quickly about the bare
cabinc it was the first time he had been
left alone and he looked for a forgotten
knife hatchet anything that might cut or
saw through the rawhide

  from outside he could hear the low tones
of basile but he did not try to overhear
whatever this new plan of the frenchman
it would be fiendish enough and now no
opportunity for escape must be overlooked

  dick could see nothing of value to him
from where he lay he rolled over so that
he might have a view of that part of the
cabine behind him but the floor was bare
and nothing hung from the empty walls
as he was about to roll back to his original
position something sharp pricked him on
one shoulder

  hitching himself around he began to feel
in the dry grass on which he had been lying
his hands were bound closely to his sides
but he could move his numbed fingers
lightly-at last they struck a hard sub-
stance his heart leaped at the first touch
for instantly he recognized the object as a
flint arrow-head he clutched it so tightly
one keen edge cut the skin between his
fingers the pain brought a smile for the
worth of the tool was proved though it
caused torture he worked his fingers around
until he could slip the flint into the pocket
in his leggings and then content rolled
back to his original position

  for the first time he became conscious of
the voices outside the hut basile greatly
excited was talking more loudly his
whispering tones penetrating farther than
had he spoken in his usual coarsened growl

  has not started to trade because he ex-
pects to winter in the west dick over-
heard his voyageurs deserted him and
he is trying to employ mascoutens to man
his canoes

did you learn his name asked leon

  no but from what the savages say
there is no doubt but that he is antoine
goddin

a licensed trader eh said michel

  and on his last journey exclaimed
basile fiercely next to this englishman
there is none i hate more it was three
before marquette

ioi

years ago in west of the sault ste marie
among the saulteurs that he robbed me of
a years profits

  is he the one who told the savages that
you were plundering them that he might get
the trade for himself asked leon

  the same a sanctimonious wretch
who has the good will of the blackrobes
talks of laws boasts that he trades legally
by the kings sanction and speaks of this
land as the new empire of france i
swore that some day i would cross his trail
and the day has come

  but there is risk in killing a french-
man objected michel savages do not
count

  risk exclaimed basile have you
too absorbed the faint-heartedness of the
englishman think man never before
has a white man penetrated to this river
none will come for years afterward and are
not the mascoutens known to be evil de-
ceitful have not his voyageurs deserted
him and will not that be known is he
not camped alone on the river does an
indian hatchet leave a different mark when
swung by a white man

  what if this licensed trader returns with
wealth do you not think more of his
breed will follow then what of us who
carry not the sanction of kings we will
be driven out of this land that we have dis-
covered out of the lands wherein our
profits lay you sicken me michel with
your tremors but in any event he is
mine i am to be avenged

  after that what plan asked leon

  we have a trading outfit goods and
brandy we will winter to the north and
in the spring we will be on our way to the
st lawrence with heavy canoes

  but the englishman

   he will still pay the price will still buy
us a canoeload of beaver skins there is a
band of hurons on lac mecheygan driven
far from their homes by the longhouses
we will take this englishman to them tell
them he is dutch from the dutch colony at
new amsterdam and they will give us
every skin in their village for him for did
not the dutch and the english too fur-
nish the longhouses with muskets and
powder

  a double haul cried leon en-
thusiastically

  yes and a double revenge for me re-
plied basile venemously i have a mind

to stay and see the hurons play with the
englishman

  and when do we- michel hesitated

  when do we brain this goddin and take
his outfit sneered basile i have a mind
to turn the englishman over to the mascou-
tens now if his presence among us fills you
with such qualms today we go on up the
river until we learn where he has his camp
then tonight and we will be rich men
again

  basile hurried away to confer with the
chiefs of the village and michel and leon
entered the hut they were silent and did
not look into the corner where dick lay
the virginian who had been bound so long
his legs and arms were becoming numb
lifted his head

  michel he said there was a time when
we might have become fast friends we
liked each other then and there should be
no cause for hard feelings now no reason
why you can not grant me one small
favor

  michel looked at him but did not reply
this rawhide is drying and shrinking
dick continued see how it is cutting
into my flesh already the feeling is gone
do me this one favor michel and loosen
the bonds a little

  leave them as they are advised leon
and the savages will be cheated and
you too answered dick another day
and my legs and arms will be dead

  there is something in that leon said
michel as he took a hesitating step toward
the prisoner see the hide has cut into
his flesh it will do no harm to loosen them
besides he will always be in our sight
he crossed over and knelt beside dick
the green hide had stiffened and contracted
and it was with difficulty that he untied the
knots as the blood rushed into his ex-
tremities dick writhed and groaned from
the excruciating pain his wrists and legs
were swollen and michel when he rebound
them could not refrain from leaving the
thongs as loose as possible

  faint from the pain but thankful that it
had not come when he had severed the
bonds himself dick lay back with his face
to the wall in a short time he knew the
blood would be running in all his veins the
numbness and swelling would almost dis-
appear and when the time for his escape
came he would have the use of his arms and
legs


adventure

dicks determination to escape
had grown twofold since he had
overheard basiles infamous plans
not only his own life but that of this un-
suspecting frenchman was at stake and all
the repugnance and horror with which he
had watched the rape of the islinois was
redoubled at the thought of basiles
treachery seeking freedom himself when
he had left virginia he was appalled at
this interpretation of it by the depraved
pombert

  we start at once cried basile as he
entered the cabine suddenly i have ex-
plained that we go to visit our countryman
and that we will return word has been
received that goddin is no more than six
leagues up the river we will start at once
so as to find his camp by dark

  with the mascoutens thronging about in
their curiosity over the spectacle of two
white men carrying another securly bound
they went down to their canoe dick was
laid in the bottom and the frenchmen
paddled off

  if basile originally had intended to keep
his plans from dicic by calling leon and
michel outside the cabine to discuss them
he abandoned the idea once they were under
way the man was exuberant already
spending the gains of this new crime he
found time too to taunt dick to describe
in detail what he intended to do when they
arrived at the camp of the licensed trader
and the virginian though he lay quietly
with his eyes closed resolved that nothing
could stand in the way of his liberty that he
might rid the earth of this evil spirit

  leon and michel wholly lacking in moral
conception rather than instinctively crim-
inal failed to respond to basiles mood
they paddled steadily their eyes always
searching the banks ahead for the camp of
the trader but they went to their work
without enthusiasm as if it were a dis-
agreeable task that must be done and then
forgotten

  late in the afternoon they began to go
more slowly reconnoitering from each bend
becoming impatient when sunset ap-
proached

  these cursed savages make a league to
their own liking complained basile we
have gone eight leagues not six and still
there is no sign of him

  be quiet whispered michel from the
bow as he threw out his paddle and drew

the canoe backward and toward the bank
there is smoke ahead around the next
bend

  silently they stepped ashore leaving
dick in the canoe and crawled through the
brush along the bank to see if they had
reached their destination while dick was
still undecided whether he should cut his
bonds then or later they returned and im-
mediately began to discuss their plans

  hes on the other bank less than a
quarter of a league away said basile
michel slip through the brush up the
shore and find a place where you can watch
him see if there is any one with him how
many canoes are there and how the land
lies behind his camp be back at dark

  dick was lifted from the canoe and basile
with his hand in the virginians collar
dragged him up the bank and back into the
brush the two then carried the canoe out
of sight and sat down to await michels re-
port

  basile now that his revenge was near
became exuberant he recounted in de-
tail the wrongs for which he held antoine
goddin responsible sneered at the circuitous
traits for which the trader was known and
exultantly described how he would end his
life

  if he is asleep i will waken him before i
strike let him see who it is that is avenging
past wrongs he declared

  you lie pombert exclaimed dick
you are too much of a coward to strike a
man except in the back and by heaven if
these thongs were off my legs and arms id
prove it now

  those thongs will stay there until the
hurons thinking you are a dutch friend of
the iroquois bum them off taunted ba-
sile and no more from you or ill give
you a taste of what the savages can do

  i well believe that you are capable of it
replied dick i do not doubt but that it
is longhouse blood itself that gives you that
swarthy countenance and that black heart

  with a cry of rage basile sprang to where
dick lay

  beware black heart the virginian
warned in a low tone touch me now and
my face will appear before you as you swing
your bloody hatchet tonight lay a hand
on me now and after the stake ill follow
you wherever you go and at last to the fire
that surely waits for you when the savages
catch their ravisher
before marquette



  the frenchman recoiled with a mumbled
oath and dick laughed outright at this re-
sult of the curse he had placed upon the
other

  go back and boast some more pom-
bert he said it amuses me

  basile was strangely quiet until the re-
turn of michel just at dusk with a report
that the trader was goddin himself and
that he was alone in his camp with two
large canoes drawn up on the bank and a
large cabine in which his goods undoubtedly
were stored the trader had cooked his
supper and was smoking his evening pipe
when michel left

  now began basile eagerly to work
well take the canoe cross the river enter
the forest and come upon him from the rear
he will be asleep soon and remember that
it is i who am to enter his cabine tonight
men tonight we will be rich no one car-
ries a greater outfit out of the st lawrence
than this goddin

  what of him while we are about this
asked leon as he nodded toward the brush
where dick lay

  let him lie until we return was the
command look after his bonds michel
and we will be off

  michel bent over dick felt of the thongs
about his ankles and those that bound his
arms to his sides and reported him secure

  in a few minutes then said basile it
will be dark and we will go

  as he spoke dick worked his fingers into
his pocket and grasped the piece of flint
not a second could be wasted time
spelled life both for goddin and himself
not only must he reach the camp before the
others but he was under the added disad-
vantage of having to cross the river without
a canoe

the moment he heard the french-
men lift their canoe from the brush
he was busy with his flint it was
difficult work for his hands were still slight-
ly numbed and he had to bend them at a
painful angle to reach a thong with his
flint he had cut half-way through when
he was surprised by the sudden appearance
of leon and basile

  well make sure of him and tie him to
this tree said the leader as he grasped
dicks collar and heaved him farther into
the brush well do it this way so that he
not only will be here when we return but

will get a little taste of what is coming to
him

  as he talked he tied one end of a thong
around dicks ankles passed it around the
tree and then beneath the captives arm-
pits he turned dick on his side with the
small of his back against the tree and then
drew the thong tight hauling the feet and
shoulders around until dick feared that his
back would be broken

  now we are certain said the french-
man as he gave the knot a final jerk

  a moment later dick heard them step in-
to the canoe and in the silence that followed
he knew that they had gone immediately
he was at work with his flint but now
his difficulties were increased as his right
hand in which he held the arrow-head was
wedged between his body and the tree he
could however still reach a thong around
the waist and to which his wrists were
bound and painfully he began to cut it
through

  twice before it snapped exhaustion
forced him to stop but his first success
brought added determination and although
his position caused excruciating pain and
the perspiration poured from his face he
continued frantically to saw at his bonds

  a half-hour went by and his hands were
not free though he had cut through the
thong in several places from the plans of
the three and the report of michel con-
cerning the location of goddins camp he
might even then be too late it occurred to
him to call to shout as loudly as he could
with the hope that he might arouse the
trader and thereby put him on his guard
as he strained to fill his lungs for the effort
the bonds about his waist loosened and his
hands fell away from his sides

  exultantly he tugged until both wrists
were free and then though the effort
brought torture to cramped muscles he
lifted his right hand above his head and cut
the thong that held shoulders and heels to-
gether around the tree the next instant
he was sitting up freeing his legs of the
coils

  dicks one plan was to reach goddins
camp in time to warn him so great was
the urgency he was able to rise despite the
pain in every muscle but when he attempt-
ed to walk he wondered vaguely why he
should suffer such torture for the sake of a
man he had never seen but the remem-
brance of basiles evil face came to him and


adventure

he struggled on northward along the river
bank teeth tightly clenched to prevent
his crying out at the agony each step
cost

  as he walked the pain became less and
when at last he saw the lighter spot against
the dark forest across the river and knew
he was opposite the traders tent he felt
able to swim the stream he plunged in at
once waded as far as he could and then
struck out for the opposite shore

  the bank sloped up gradually from the
water to the door of the tent or cabinc as
the french called it which was set in the
center of a small opening in the forest for
a moment dick watched and listened and
then began to crawl forward on his hands
and knees

  stay where you are or i will shoot
came a low voice from the thick brush at his
left

  dicks first thought was that one of the
three frenchmen had seen him and he was
about to run for cover when the even cool
tone impressed itself upon him for the first
time

  monsieur goddin he whispered is
that you

  it is and ill shoot if you move lie
where you are

  dick saw a figure coming toward him
from the brush

  monsieur goddin he whispered i am
a friend though you never saw me but
three frenchmen are about to attack you
from the forest thank god i have been
in time

  you are an englishman said goddin
your story is as strange as your presence
in this country

  for your life sir do not speak above a
whisper implored dick you can see
that i am unarmed go back to the
brush and i will follow and explain but
pray make no noise

  goddin hesitated a moment and then
walked backward toward the place where
he had hidden dick crawled after him

  now said goddin who still kept his
musket aimed at dick what is this non-
sense about three frenchmen attacking a
countryman

  do you know a eoureur de bois named
basile pombert dick asked in reply

  you have proven your words was the
quick answer in an entirely different tone
i need listen to no more except the details

of pomberts villainy and i daresay that
those co-devils leon la gard and michel
charon are with him

  they are answered dick and all
three may be even now at the edge of this
clearing they left me across the river
below the next bend securely tied they be-
lieved and paddled across and planned to
come upon you from the rear when you
were asleep

  twice foiled laughed goddin softly
there is a big swamp directly behind the
tent through which they are probably
floundering and you will notice yourself
monsieur that i was not asleep in my tent
does pombert take me for a fool to sleep so
when i am alone among strange savages
my bed was here and you wakened me
they would have done the same

  then dick began

  not a mite less thanks to you monsieur
and i will show that antoine goddin never
forgets a favor or the reverse but all that
may wait until tomorrow now we will
plan to rid new france of this pombert and
thereby merit the respect of all honest men
the others are only tools of his and will
stand or fall as the battle swings listen
i heard a broken twig

chapter ix

the medicine man

  listen monsieur whispered dick
j when he and goddin were safely
hidden in the bushes i placed a curse
on pombert today not that i believe in it
but because i knew that he would and i was
not sure that i would free myself and warn
you in time i told him that when he
struck your sleeping figure with his hatchet
my face would appear before him

  there is only a roll of blankets for him
to murder in the tent answered the
frenchman a shot from my musket
at this distance is ample

  but pombert is mine i told him
i would kill him some day

  it is not well to hate so my friend

  it is not hate it is a loathing like a
man has for a snake pombert is an evil
thing a vile thing and there is no murder
in lulling him besides i still feel that
green thong tightening into my flesh
goddin laughed

  you have hardly proved your point
before marquette



monsieur but you have the desire and he
is yours here is my musket

  no a hatchet is what i want what he
deserves and ill be waiting for him in
the tent he will see my face when he is
ready to strike

  goddin handed the virginian a small ax
that he had placed in his nest in the brush
and instantly dick was worming his way
forward in the grass the frenchman
looked saw him start and then nothing
moved in the darkness

  i did not know an englishman had
blood so warm he mused but he is a
man and i think a man after my own
liking

  goddin did not have long to wait it
was too dark for him to see a figure against
the thick foliage behind the camp but he
could distinguish a shadow between him
and the white tent it flitted across
silently quickly and he knew pombert
had come

  dick in the manner he had learned from
the indian boys in his youth had gained
the tent without the possibility of being
seen from the thicket behind it the
grass was long and his movements so silent
a snake could not have done it more
quietly he slipped in under the flap
almost on top of the bed antoine goddin
had arranged for just such an emergency
behind it piled to the peak were bales of
goods against these dick leaned waiting
his hatchet ready

  there was a faint sound beside the tent
a pause then further movement in a
moment the tent flap began to move back
and dick heard the rustle of a body rubbing
against the canvas the triangle of black-
ness lost its clear-cut shape and a dark
figure arose one arm lifted

  beware pombert dick warned in
sepulchral tones

  a shriek that seemed to rip open the tent
burst from the frenchmans throat he
staggered back helpless in his terror

  come craven dick said sharply
lift your hand to strike i could not even
kill a snake that runs

  the words had their desired effect with
a second cry now of rage basile sprang
forward a knife uplifted his every move-
ment was silhouetted against the white tent
while the virginians position could be
distinguished only by his voice dick
stepped to one side and the head of his

hatchet crushed into pomberts skull
without a sound the frenchman collapsed
he had hardly touched the ground before
dick had gripped his collar and dragged
him outside

  as he stood there about to call to goddin
the crashing of brush in the forest behind
the camp told him of the presence of the
others

  leon he cried michel come and
get the carrion

  the crashing only grew louder and dick
laughed

  come monsieur goddin he called in
a loud voice we live in a safer world
the frenchman ran swiftly across the
clear ring

  monsieur he said solemnly as he saw
the body lying at dicks feet i and all
honest men owe you their thanks it is a
strange thing that liberty appears in such
various guises to pombert it meant a
chance to rob to plunder to kill and to
escape punishment thank god that same
freedom attracts men who think and see
in straight lines for no finer land ever lay
beneath the sun than that in which we are
monsieur and it must be saved for those
who will not abuse it

  who are you demanded dick curi-
ously to speak and think in this manner
a coureur lie bois monsieur

  but he and dick touched pomberts
body with his foot

  also a ranger of the forests and one of
too many who are giving us the name of
thieves and ravishers of licentious outlaws
of deiilers of a simple people and a fair land
but we are not all thus as you shall leam
if you stay in this country to be a forest
runner does not always mean to be a thief

  but what of you monsieur you must
pardon my curiosity but an englishman in
a land where englishmen have never been
of which they do not even know and a man
of your character in company with basile
pombert-you can see that the whole is very
strange

  but there is nothing strange in my
story replied dick and i will tell it to
you but first let us rid ourselves of what
remains of pombert he was made in
gods image even if wholly devoid ot
his precepts i would not like to think
that wild beasts devoured even the body of
such a man

  we will carry it into the brush and cover
io

adventure

it with a blanket said goddin in the
morning there will be light and now you
need a lire for you are wet

they carried the body away from
the tent and built a fire for they
had no fear of leon and michel
while dick warmed and dried himself he
gave his history beginning as he had done
on the des plaines river with his boyhood
his wanderings his encounter with sir
william berkeley his escape from virginia
his hazardous journey down the ohio
his discovery of lac mecheygan and his
finding the coureurs de bois

  throughout the recital dick spoke lightly
recounting his conversation with sir wil-
liam in detail because he still laughed over
it himself

  my faith monsieur goddin exclaimed
after his hearty laughter had interrupted
the tale you have the spirit of the
french the latin lightness of humor i
did not know that englishmen could even
appreciate satire they have always been
pictured to me as slow of wit and inclined
to be morose

  perhaps i am not an englishman
replied dick seriously how long have
you lived in this land beyond the western
ocean

  twenty years and more

  and i was born in it do you not think
monsieur that birth in such a land as this
or a long life in it instils something in the
heart that is entirely different from that of
the man in europe

  i am sure of it was the answer i
have often thought so it has already
begun your own pilgrims to the plym-
outh country the huguenots from mine
own france who settled in la floride only
to perish they are the straws but what
led to your trouble with pombert

  dick told of the pillaging of the islinois
of the flight and of pomberts attempt to
obtain revenge and to recoup by giving him
to the indians as a prisoner

  i feel said goddin solemnly that
you have twice saved my life my friend
i was on my way to the country of the
islinois of whom i had heard now it
would be folly to go on the story of
pomberts treachery will spread far and
it will ill fare a frenchman who ventures
among them now i must return to the
country south of lac superior on the waters

of the miscousing or ouisconsin as it is
called where i have wintered before i
had hoped to return with bales of the skins
of wild cattle of which i have heard but
now will take beaver instead what are
your plans

  plans laughed dick where have
i had time for planning i had hoped to
find the french and lead the life of the
coureurs de bois after what i saw of the
methods of pombert i knew it was im-
possible

  would you come with me as voyageur
i am without men and your profits you
know are fixed by law the voyageurs
receive half after all expenses are paid and
divide it among themselves

  i will do so gladly replied dick
eagerly but only on condition that i go
as your friend it is not that i would
escape the labor you are welcome to all
i have but i would not earn so generous
a share after half the journey has been
made

  i would be glad to have you with me
as a friend said goddin warmly and
the profits will be settled to your satisfac-
tion i am expecting four indians in the
morning to help me with the canoes and
the goods i had made arrangements for
them to go south but they will more
willingly go north come and share my
bed for you must be tired

  there began for the young virginian the
life of which he had dreamed the pleas-
ant summer waned and the wonderful fall
came and always they traveled northward
large lakes and little rivers that flowed
sluggishly or tumbled over rocks creeks
too small for paddling the heavily-loaded
canoes portages in swamp forest and
prairie each was traversed and each began
to signify to dick a new link in the friend-
ship which bound goddin and himself

  here was no villainy no plan for plunder
or murder no thought of a quick dash into
a new country to despoil and leave a trail
of rape and poisoned passion here was
no desire to abuse what seemed nothing
less than a heaven-granted privilege the
right towander at will through this won-
derfully fertile country to live in the
tranquility of that peace which only the
wide places know

  as they traveled on and on crossing
from one watercourse to another watching
the character of the land change constantly
before marquette



and yet always remain fair dick began to
question as to its extent

  no man knows was goddins answer
it is my desire to find out some day to
go on and on into the west until i come to
the sea it was this desire that first sent
me into the country around the uppermost
of these great lakes and according to my
calculations and plans another year or two
should see me on my way

  to the south sea the gulf of cali-
fornia asked dick eagerly

   i often doubt if that is what i will find
said goddin for ten years now i have
traded in the district around michili-
makinac i have talked with saulteurs
from beyond lac superior with the hurons
and outaouas ouinibegous outagamis
mascoutens renards sakis and even with
the nadouaissioux who live farther to
the west than any tribe white men have
ever seen i have listened to eoureurs de
bois who have been in places of which they
dare not speak when they return to the
st lawrence and i have questioned other
forest rangers like nicholas perrot raddi-
son and groseilliers and with jesuits who
are always seeking new pagan peoples and
all these are men who do speak of the places
they have seen

  if you believe all that you hear you
would go mad i think it is the white man
and the white mans hope that has given
rise to the story of the red sea being near
us that and the savage legends of stinking
water by which they mean salt my own
opinion based upon reports from all sources
and arrived at after much weighing and
sifting and balancing is that we are still
a long way from the gulf of california

  the great water the misisepe of
which the savages speak is only a river
i feel certain but a large river like the st
lawrence and flowing through an immense
country great streams come in from the
west and i believe one could travel almost
a thousand leagues and still fail to reach
the eastern ocean the way to the indies

  the white man hopes for the south sea
and pearls and gold he grasps eagerly
at tales of great water and strange people
forgetting that the savage is fearful of
unknown lands and prone to believe in
monsters and unnatural things i have
even talked with savages who i am certain
have been on the misisepe and within two
years i expect to be there myself the

cost of such an expedition is great but
i have been saving and after another visit
to montreal i will start

they spoke often of this great
water and of what might he
beyond it dick was continually
amazed by the extent of goddins travels
his knowledge of the various savage nations
and the districts they claimed as their own
the frenchman was generous with his
information and the young virginian
finding romance in every word absorbed
it to the last detail he learned too the
names and histories of many frenchmen
eoureurs de bois men who had traveled far
endured much only to fail to receive recog-
nition from france for all their efforts

  it is a strange thing that sends men
into unknown places said goddin one
night but since the world began i
imagine men have done it they risk
their lives everything endure incredible
hardships and they die only with the
satisfaction that they were first of their
race in some part of the world you have
the soul of an explorer monsieur dick
why do you not join me in this journey
i have planned perhaps we might dis-
cover this great water learn a little of the
land beyond

   the words brought a smile to dicks eyes
which he could not conceal and goddin
seeing his mirth angry hurt stared at him
in silence

  pardon me monsieur the virginian
begged contritely my sense of humor
is ever ready to give offense but there
is some cause for laughter i scorned the
chance even to save my neck from the
noose to find this land for one king now
after all my adventures in a quest for
freedom you ask me to help find it for
another sir william berkeley promised
me honor to serve king charles to take
in his name a land he would never see and
you ask me to do the same for still another
who believes that god gave him the right
to persecute honest men think you then
that there can be no kingless land

  do you remember your asking me if i
believed that this land and the air above it
instil something in the heart of a man
which is unknown in europe asked
goddin in answer i do believe that and
i believe that some day this land will be
filled with people of the white race and
io

adventure

that they will rule themselves perhaps
it is only a dream perhaps i brood too
much when alone in the forest but perhaps
i do see the significance of events in europe
and therg is a basis for my belief in the
growing power of the people to think for
themselves yet despite even reason i
can not help but feel that this land you
and i have seen can never come under the
rule of a tyrant

  many times when i have looked over
the broad valleys have dug my toe into
the fertile soil have traveled so far and so
easily on the great waterways i have in
my imagination seen farms and villages
and cities filled with a happy contented
prosperous people i have said this to
others once to perrot and have been
laughed at

   what perrot exclaimed this sav-
age land another france a plow in these
prairies ships on these great lakes an-
toine you are a dreamer this is a fur
land and will remain so it istoo far and
besides there are not people enough in all
the world to fill a corner of it its fur we
seek here and all we will ever find and for
that we should be thankful

  i didnt say so to him but i see the fur
trade as the opening wedge only some-
thing that will serve its purpose and be
gone that is why i am content to follow
it if by doing so i will add my mite to
making the land known

  but you have not answered my ob-
jections to finding this land in the name of
a king protested dick

  i was only leading up to it you saw
pomberts idea of liberty you must
admit that even a kings is better to me
a king is only a symbol for the people he
rules and in time i believe that all kings
if they exist at all will be only symbols
of what holds the people together and gives
them safety and happiness if i found
this great water this misisepe i would
take it in the name of my king to make
my act legal but in reality i would know
that i was taking it in the name of my race
my nation the people of whom i am one
and that in time it would be theirs

  this was a new idea for dick and he
received goddins words in an unusually
thoughtful silence the older man sensing
the impression he had made content to
plant only the seeds in dicks fertile mind
changed the subject to one lying more near

their every-day life it was not however
the last discussion on this topic again
and again it cropped up in their long talks
before the camp-fire in the evenings and
always though dick said little the french-
man felt more and more certain that when
the time came to do that for which he had
waited he would not go alone

  goddin was by no means always serious
and in dicks exuberant spirits as well as
in his freedom from accepted beliefs he
found a constant source of delight he
recognized too the romantic nature of the
virginian and recounted many adventures
described many scenes in strange places
and unfolded a wealth of information con-
cerning the many savage nations which
lived in the neighborhood of the great lakes

  in the early fall they reached a place
far up the ouisconsin river where goddin
had wintered two years before and where
beaver skins were plentiful and of ex-
ceptional quality the four indians re-
turned to their own country and the two
white men repaired the cabines goddin had
used before moved the trade-goods into
one and made the other comfortable for
living-quarters

  the winter was a busy one and for dick
passed quickly the savages seemed to
learn miraculously that they had come and
flocked to the post later when the snows
were deep goddin and dick made journeys
to their camps always they obtained fur
on these trips and weekly dick saw the pile
of goods diminish and the bales of pelts
increase

  it was well that the two worked at their
fur-gathering in the early winter for with
the approach of spring came the usual
famine season and with it came a change
in the industry of the savages the fur trade
stopping as suddenly as if it had been cut
off with a knife goddin knowing that
their work in the district was finished
made plans to go down-river as soon as the
ice would permit and the fur was baled
for the journey

  daily the famine grew worse dick
found one camp wiped out by starvation
hunters brought their families and crowded
around the post begging for food goddin
though his own supplies were low and he
and dick were living mostly on what little
game they were able to kill gave what he
could even in the face of possible want
for themselves the frenchman could not
before marquette



refrain from giving food to the women and
children who hung about his door though
he was severe enough in denouncing the
men for not hunting and daily drove them
out in search of game

h among the ouinibegous who
sought goddins charity was a
medicine-man who had gained suffi-
cient prestige in his band to abandon hunt-
ing and live off the proceeds of his magic
arts once goddin caught him taking
food he had just given to a child and drove
him off with a club

  sickness followed hard on the heels of
famine and there were several deaths the
medicine-mans services were in demand
but as his patients died he became more
and more bitter toward the white men
denouncing them as the cause of his failures
to cure and openly insolent when he
encountered goddin alone

   one family the first to arrive at the post
had been particularly troublesome the
father was too lazy to hunt and upon the
mother fell the work of providing for the
three children her bravery in the face
of her difficulties her refusal to complain
the ceaseless efforts she made to snare birds
and hares her self-denial and her affection
for her children had aroused the sympathy
and admiration of dick and goddin and
she was helped more generously than any
of the others

  she never begged until one day when
the snow had nearly gone and the ice was
breaking in the river she brought to the
cabin her youngest child its wasted little
body was wrapped in a filthy deerskin
and when she threw this back the white
men recoiled with exclamations of horror
the entire body of the child was covered
with large ulcerated sores

  have you no medicines asked dick

  i have an ointment for troubles of the
skin and ill use it exclaimed goddin
fiercely it is folly to meddle with such
things the jesuits have aroused much
resentment by preaching against the medi-
cine-man it can only lead to trouble
but we cant abandon this woman now
she has been brave and she has done
everything possible to keep her family
alive we cant desert her dick ill
give her the ointment to apply

  the woman went away her eyes alone
expressing her thankfulness and a few

minutes later when goddin found her
husband on the river bank sprawled out
in the welcome sun he chased him into the
forest with a club

  the dog lies there while she eats out
her own heart he stormed to dick as
they sat down to dinner it is folly to do
this to interfere with them for they believe
that the- are right in all things and secretly
laugh at our methods though they are
anxious enough to have our steel and goods
but we will be leaving in a few days now
and im willing to have taken the risk

  the frenchman anxious to start down
the river with the first breaking of the ice
had completed his preparations in the first
of april the fur was baled the canoes
had been made ready six ouinibegous had
been engaged to man them as far as michili-
makinac and the maize and wild oats which
had been saved for the journey were
sacked

  two days after the indian woman had
been given the ointment the two white
men stood on the bank of the river watching
the ice grind down stream the warm sun
was welcomed on their backs little rivulets
of water flowed into the larger stream some
trees were beginning to open their buds

  tomorrow is the day said goddin
by tonight the river will be free of ice and
by the time we reach the portage into the
river that will take us to lac mecheygan
the water will be so high we can paddle
across and escape the carry of nearly half a
league run up the river to where the
savages are camped my friend and tell
the men we have engaged to be here tonight
then we can start early in the morning

  dick took his musket for a buck or even
a bird was welcome and entered the forest
a half-lcague up the river the savages had
gathered at a rapids that they might catch
the first fish of the spring run but when
dick reached their village he found the men
squatting in the sun before the cabines
while the women were equally idle

  the sullen silence with which he was
greeted instantly acquainted dick with the
fact that something was wrong his sum-
mons to the men goddin had engaged was
received without comment as he stood
there staring about liim wondering at this
sudden change in the attitude of the savages
toward bun the death wail arose from the
last cabine of the row along the river bank
the shrieks echoed up and down the
no

adventure

stream and women all about him joined in
the shrill moaning cry until dick was forced
to stop his ears

  who is dead he asked of an old man
who had always been friendly

  the savage growled an unintelligible
reply and turned his back

  at a loss to explain this unfriendliness
of a people who had fawned about him in
their desire for food only the week before
dick walked out of the village and sought
the trail to the post once or twice he
glanced back uneasily

  who cares if the beggars are unfriendly
now that the fish are beginning to fill their
miserable stomachs he muttered as he
walked swiftly down the trail we will
be gone tomorrow

  a low hiss from the brush beside him
brought a quick halt and he turned to see
an old indian looking out from behind a
giant pine

  hurry back whispered the man whom
dick recognized as an islinois the ouini-
begous had taken prisoner and kept as a
slave the child for whom the french-
man made medicine has died the medi-
cine-man of the band has claimed that the
white mens medicine kitled him he and
the childs father are even now on the way
to the white mens cabine their minds
are evil and they carry the white mens
arrows if you would arrive in time to save
the bearded white man do not wait get
into the canoes and flee for the medicine-
man has stirred up all the people against
you

  before the man had finished dick was
running down the trail he realized in-
stantly what lay back of his reception at
the village and he had learned enough
of the treacherous nature of the ouini-
begous to recognize the danger to goddin
it would not be an open attack neither
the medicine-man nor the lazy father of
the dead child would dare it would be a
stealthy stalk in the shelter of the bushes
behind the cabine a musket fired so close
there would be no chance of missing

  his heart chilled by the fear that he
would be too late to save his friend dick
ran as he had never run before he forgot
the heavy musket in his hand splashed
heedlessly through water and swamp and
melting snow leaped over fallen trees and
dashed the brush aside

  breathless he came at last to the clearing

in which the two rojigh log buildings stood
it was empty of any living tiling and dick
hysterical in his thankfulness stopping to
gulp the air into his bursting lungs began
to search the brush around the edge for a
lurking figure

   as he looked goddin stepped out through
the door in the same instant that the
warning cry sprang to dicks lips a musket
roared and the frenchman swayed clutched
at his breast and then fell at full length

chapter x

alone

txick jeffreys sickened nerveless
- stunned by the horror of this unthink-
able crime benumbed by the loss of his
friend stared across the clearing as if he
were looking at something unreal as if he
were still in the grip of a horrible nightmare
he did not move could not until a black
head appeared from behind a clump of
bushes

   the sight brought instant action and he
dashed into the open straight toward the
ambush from which goddin had been
slaughtered so quick was his rush so
swiftly did rage spur him on he had passed
the cabines before the murderers had gained
their feet to flee one fired a musket
wildly and then dropped it his back was
hardly turned before dick was upon him
and the virginians heavy weapon crashed
down through his skull

  the second savage the father of the
dead child the one whose musket was
empty and therefore who had actually
fired the shot which had killed goddin
dodged from tree to tree but he had not
run twenty yards before a ball struck him
scjuarelv in the middle of the back

   still raging hysterical sobbing his brain
in a tumult dick turned back to the clear-
ing fearful now in the presence of
death hesitating as he was about to look
into the white face of the man he had
grown to love he approached goddins
body slowly when only a few paces away
there was a slight twitch in one of the
frenchmans legs and with a glad cry the
virginian sprang forward and turned his
friend over

  antoine he cried open your eyes
you can not-you must not die

  eagerly he thrust his hand inside
before marquette

hi

goddins shirt the heart was still beat-
ing

  and then through his loneliness and
despair for his friend and his rage against
the savages who had brought this sorrow
to him another fact impressed itself
instantly he leaped to his feet

  over the forest had descended a sudden
hush there was no sound except the
occasional lazy grinding of a laggard ice
cake against the shore dick realized for
the first time that throughout his run
down the river from the indian village
while he stood at the edge of the clearing
even while the savages musket roared and
antoine fell the death wail had been echo-
ing up and down the valley now all was
still

  dick stood looking up the river the
village was around a bend but he knew
instinctively what was transpiring there
the women had ceased their wailing but
in another moment the war-cry would take
its place the musket shots had been
heard the medicine-man and his dupe
would not return inside of an hour thirty
men would be at his heels

 instantly he decided upon the only
possible course he stooped over goddin
just as the frenchman opened his eyes

  thank god whispered dick i must
carry you to the canoe tell me if it hurts
too much but bear as much as you can
my friend the savages will be here in an
hour and we must be downstream as far
as possible

  dick slipped his arms gently beneath
goddins body and staggered to his feet
a canoe was drawn partly out of the water
and in this he laid his burden imme-
diately he was running back to the cabine
to return with powder-horns bullet pouches
an ax blankets and several other articles
that first met his eyes he dumped these
into the bow and ran back for corn wild
oats a kettle and whatever else he could
lay his hands on with an ax he crushed
in the sides of the remaining craft and five
minutes after he had lifted goddin their
canoe was afloat and turned downstream

  for half an hour dick paddled with all
his skill and strength he wanted to get
as far away as possible before the pursuit
started because he knew that he must stop
soon to dress goddins wounds a long
straight stretch of water a league below
the post offered the opportunity he desired

and when he reached the lower end of it
he turned ashore at a point where he could
command his back trail for a long distance

  as he stepped out and examined the
wounded man he felt suddenly numb
suddenly alone in the vast savage-peopled
wilderness that there could be no hope
he recognized instantly and yet because the
bond between them was so strong dick
would not admit his despair the bullet
had smashed goddins right arm above the
elbow and then entered his right lung
perhaps the left for it had not passed out
on the other side in the bottom of the
canoe was a pool of blood and the injured
mans beard was crimson

  dick cut off the sleeve of the jacket and
bound up the arm as best he could the
hole in the side was more difficult and every
time he moved the body blood gushed out
he completed the task only partly to his
satisfaction and as he finished goddin again
regained consciousness

  it is bad he whispered as his eyes
met dicks

  not at all was the instant reply
nothing that will keep you on your back
more than a few days

  i knew you would say that dick but
i know what has happened if i were in
montreal with the best surgeon in new
france at hand i could not live

  of course not if you think that way
why antoine before we reach michili-
makinac youll be helping me paddle
before we reach the river of the mas-
coutens you will dig a grave answered
goddin calmly but why are we in a
canoe dick

  i killed the dog who shot you and the
medicine-man who drove him to it was
the reply at the village they were sullen
and it needed only that to turn them into
a wolf-pack

  but the furs and what remained of the
outfit i wanted you to have the benefit
of them my friend

  i wouldnt touch a hide of them ex-
claimed dick fiercely what is all the fur
in new france to your life antoine
dont speak of such a thing now

  and my license too continued the
frenchman that is in a wallet in my
pocket dick dont forget it when you
bury me

  i wont listen to you cried the vir-
ginian as he sprang to his feet


adventure

  he had been watching the long stretch
of river anxiously and suddenly he grasped
the bow of the canoe and set it afloat

  they are coming antoine he whis-
pered as he pushed out into the current
be brave for it will be many hours before
we stop again

seeking always the swiftest cur-
rent exerting all his strength in
every stroke dick drove the canoe
on hour after hour without losing a pace
in distance or a moment in time he kept
steadily on at top speed the fear of the
pursuing ouinibegous was constantly with
him but it was never for himself always
there was the picture of their remorseless-
ness the fiendish speed with which they
would bind antoine to a tree that he might
not die before they could add to his agony

  the afternoon wore on and evening came
the river bent often and sharply and there
were no long stretches by which he could
gauge the result of the race at every
curve he glanced over his shoulder but
darkness set in without his catching a
glimpse of the pursuing craft he was
still ahead because he had only to flee and
the savages had to guard against his hid-
ing on shore

  the night brought excessive weariness
but no cessation of his efforts he knew
that he had probably held his own and now
he could not afford to forego the oppor-
tunity to increase his lead the low
clouds the absence of moon or stars were
his hope for the savages must go slowly to
make sure they did not pass him yet he
cursed the darkness fearfully for he could
no longer see the pale face of antoine
even as he struggled on to save him life
might pass

  this dread uncertainty finally brought
a halt the first in long hours of paddling
he laid aside his blade and crawled for-
ward

  antoine he whispered

  yes dick was the feeble answer

  what can i do for you

  a drink please i am burning up and
cold too

  dick dipped the kettle over the side
and lifted goddins head then he
wrapped blankets about him and returned
to the paddle in the stern

  more hours went by and in the silence
and darkness the canoe sped on into the

south if dick were weary if his arms
and shoulders and back ached he did not
know it he thought only of what would
happen should the ouinibegous overtake
him of how he must outdistance them
so that he could have time to care for
antoine

  as the night wore on goddin became
delirious he rolled and tossed in the
bottom of the canoe and often dick was
forced to stop and thrust him down be-
neath the thwarts he talked continually
now of his boyhood in france of his father
and mother of montreal the river of the
outaouas of perrot and raddison and
groseilliers of many strange nations of
savages and of distant places he had seen
sometimes he spoke in french sometimes
in the language of the saulteurs or the
ouinibegous the hurons the outaouas
and even of the nadouaissioux

  dick understood them all for he was
not only familiar with the algonquin
dialects but to his surprise he had found
that the ouinibegous spoke a language
almost the same as that of the sheraws
of his own virginia while that of the
nadouaissioux who lived north of the
great water as spoken by goddin
showed that these widely scattered nations
belonged to the same family

  the delirium added to dicks fear for
his friend since each contortion of the
frenchmans body reopened his wounds
but he dared not stop for always there
was the greater fear of being overtaken
by the ouinibegous of them and their
methods he had learned enough during
his winter among them and from goddins
stories to keep him pushing on after every
ounce of strength in his body seemed to
have been exhausted

  the ouinibegous had once been a power-
ful nation vain insolent deceitful eaters of
their enemies flesh wholly untrustworthy
accused of more crimes than any people
except the longhouses now they were
reduced to a comparative handful since
the islinois had avenged themselves fora
bit of treachery that had brought exclama-
tions of horror even from several nations
of the savages themselves embittered in
their defeat their desire for conquest and
torture had been sharpened and all of
this would vent itself upon the helpless
frenchman should they succeed in his
capture
before marquette



  in the dawn dick kept on as he had all
night he was without a plan without
any alternative he remembered that
goddin had told him how in the spring
floods it was possible to paddle across the
portage from the ouisconsin into the river
which led to lac mecheygan now his
hopes depended upon that being true if
he could reach this place and get through
to the river of the mascoutens he might
escape in time to reach lac mecheygan
and michilimakinac where there undoubt-
edly would be frenchmen and proper care
for his friend

  dick estimated that with the swift
current he was making two leagues an hour
if not a little more and they had wintered
about fifty leagues above the portage if
he kept on paddling throughout the twenty-
tour hours he would come to the carrying-
place at noon there he could leave the
ouisconsin and in a short time be in waters
that flowed to lac mecheygan

  success in his plan depended entirely
upon his ability to gain on the savages
that they would continue the pursuit he
did not doubt not only because he had
killed their medicine-man and another
but because they would not wish to incur
the hostility of the french and the powerful
nations allied with them the ouinibegous
in their weakened condition could not afford
to have news of their treachery reach
michilimakinac

  but the forenoon hours dragged by
without his being able to learn whether
he were half a league or five leagues in the
lead at dawn goddins delirium had
ceased but the bottom of the canoe was
covered with blood a red stream trickling
down between dicks knees into the stern
the wounded mans face was deadly white
he lay without movement and his eyes
were closed

  the suspense became unbearable to dick
even if life remained it might pass at any
moment at last in frantic desperation
heedless of consequences he laid aside his
paddle and crawled forward

  antoine he whispered anxiously an-
toine are you awake

  goddin opened his eyes and looked up at
his friend

  i was sleeping dick he whispered
but i am glad you wakened me for i feel
sure that i would have passed away without
knowing it

 come come you must not speak

that way

  nor must you try to deceive yourself
my friend it is coming soon very soon
and i wish you would take me ashore
lean me against a tree in the sun and let
me die looking at this fair land i have
grown to love

  dick was about to protest when goddins
eyes closed his face became contorted by
pain and blood flowed from his mouth
the virginian realized that what he had
tried to make himself believe could not be
true that the end had come

ildb returning to the stem he
kab glanced back up-stream he was
at the foot of a long straight stretch
the first he had passed since daylight
ahead the river turned sharply to the left
curving at the foot of a low grassy bank
upon which was a thick grove of oaks it
was a spot goddin would like a fair view
of river and shore and it would give dick
an opportunity to watch his back-trail for
nearly a league he paddled to it landed
and then with infinite care and at the cost
of all his strength he lifted goddin to the
grass at the foot of the trees

  thank you dick said antoine when
he looked up the long stretch of river it
is the place i would have chosen now if
i may have a drink please there
thank you now sit down in front of me
dick and please do not look as if the end
of the world had come there is no reason
why death should be so dreadful

  antoine antoine cried the virginian
dont speak so you can not die
now

  you are young my friend and youth
always has the wrong idea of death there
is no reason why death should not be
pleasant it is for me as i lie here with this
view before me with the smell of spring
in the air and with you beside me that is
one of the things i am most thankful for
that i have known you and that we have
this friendship it has brought youth to
me dick mine own youth back again and
i owe you much

  his eyes closed his lips moved silently
for a moment and he seemed to be asleep
after a while he began to speak again

  i am not regretful i have lived a full
life though i have not accomplished all
that i had wished i have gone through it
ii

adventure

with open eyes knowing that this life in
the wilderness is filled with danger but
it has been the sauce for the pudding and
those of us who take the risks can not
complain when we are caught

  i will be gone soon dick i can see
only a little way up the river just across
to the other shore i want you to have my
license to trade friend it is the only
thing i can leave and i will go content
that you will make honest use of it that
you will see as i have seen that the fur is
only the beginning that this fair land was
not meant for savages who spend their lives
in killing and torturing that there is to
come a day when it will be filled with a
happy people

  i know you have the vision and the
true heart and that you will do your share
in the work that is to be done you may
never receive a reward may even be perse-
cuted for what you do history may never
give you credit but those are little things
live so that you may die with a clean heart
and the honest conviction that you have
done your duty to your fellow-men that
is the sum of life and i know it will be
yours

  again his eyes closed and he was silent
for a long time dick feared the ei had
come and waited in dumb terror at last
the blood-blackened lips moved

  i am going dick he whispered
good-by friend i wish you would-no
i will not ask a promise i know you will
go on into this new land i had hoped to
find it for my people take it in the name of
my king but yours will do as well for it
can never be a kings land but a country
of an honest happy people good-bv
dick

  the young virginian tears streaming
down his face bent over the hand of his
friend and kissed it passionately

  antoine antoine he cried

  the fingers stiffened convulsively in his
clasp blood flowed from the wounded
mans lips and dick knew that he was
alone

  for a time he knelt there beside the body
he had hoped refused to believe and now
that death had come to this man for whom
he had never had anything except love and
respect he was as stunned as though the
ouinibegous bullet had brought instant
oblivion

  humbly reverently he stretched the

body out beneath the tree folded the
hands across the chest and stood looking
down into the calm peaceful face

  it is when we die that we have the only
test of bravery he said aloud life but
trains us for it here died a man with a
heart like those of the knights of old

  the stillness of the bright sunny spring
noon wp suddenly rent by a chorus of
whoops vnd shrill yells dick wheeled
toward the river to see three canoes each
manned by a half-dozen savages less than
half a league away

chapter xi

the vision

with his heart empty in the deefl
black despondency of youth dicks
first thought was to remain where he was
to stand above the body of his friend and
avenge him before he himself at last fell
beside it he need not wait long in a
few minutes all would be over

  but a remembrance of savage methods
of which he had heard quickened him to
action it would be sacrilege to leave what
remained of his friend to be the plaything of
their inhuman passions to permit that
strong brave face to be mutilated even in
death he stooped grasped the body
about the waist and staggered down to tire
canoe with it he dropped it on to the
blood-soaked blankets for every second
was precious and shoved off a few
strokes took him around the bend but not
out of hearing of the yells of rage that
echoed up and down the river

  as grimly as twenty-four hours before
dick settled to his task with a lead of
less than half a league not a stroke must be
missed his own canoe was fast one
goddin had ordered made according to his
own design but it was heavily loaded and
driven by only one paddle the pursuing
canoes were larger slower but propelled by
half a dozen blades each and the swift
current would play no favorites

  the one factor in dicks favor the one
which probably had given him the last
uninterrupted moments with antoine was
the fact that the ouinibegous would be
delayed by the fear that he would hide
behind some island or turn up a forest-
hidden tributary around one of the quick
bends it would be easy for him to go ashore
before marquette

ii

hide himself and the canoe and watch them
pass

  but this would only serve to put his ene-
mies between him and ultimate safety
while there was always the danger that a
sharp eye would catch a glimpse of sign on
the wet shore for the present at least
his best course lay in keeping as far ahead as
possible and he drove on always in the
swiftest part of the current never overlook-
ing any position that would add to his speed

  he was weary sore losing strength but
like a true racer he ascribed greater weari-
ness and debility to his adversaries while
his will spurred muscles that shrieked their
agony but submitted

  an hour went by the river twisted and
turned and not once did dick catch sight of
the savages mid-af ternoon came and for the
first time he thought of the portage into the
river of the mascoutens the only route to
lac mecheygan and a land in which he could
find white men he began to watch the
banks but nothing was familiar he had
come up with goddin when the water was
low at the end of a dry summer now the
ouisconsin was beginning to overflow its
banks and it was not at all like the stream
on which he had embarked the day before

  more perplexing than all else his general
course was different early in the day he
had traveled in a southeasterly direction
now the declining sun was to the left of the
bow it could mean only that he was trav-
eling toward the southwest away from lac
mecheygan

  dick however still hoped for the portage
still watched the left bank for signs of the
carrying-place but he dared not stop for a
careful search so long as he could lift a
paddle he must keep on with the current
if he had missed the portage it was a hazard
of the game all forest-rangers must expect

  before sunset there was no longer any
doubt in his mind that he had passed it
the character of the country had changed
pines had given way to oak maple linden
elms aspens and along the shores willows
in thick hedges high bluffs now bordered
the valley which was from one to two
leagues wide and the river three or four
times as big as where he had begun his
journey seemed to wander about the great
bottom lands as if seeking a better channel

  the flood was not at its height for the
sandbars which formed the banks were
still dry dick could see evidences of how

the river sometimes had taken the entire
valley for its bed now it turned and
twisted dashed from the high bluffs on one
side to those on the other only to be turned
again by the great hills

  the river too was now thickly strewn
with islands sometimes they were bare
white stretches of sand again they were
small thin strips of higher ground upon
which great trees were growing always
the river gnawed at their sides and under-
mined trees hung far out over the current
often the islands stretched for a league or
two in a long line connected by rows of
willows the tops of which waved in the cur-
rent two channels then resulted each a
river in itself

  in the evening the stream straightened
out for more than a league and was com-
paratively free of islands at the lower
end dick laid aside his paddle and looked
back as the canoe was whirled on by the
swift current he watched the far end of the
straight stretch now if ever the pursu-
ing canoes would be seen but at last he
swung around the bend without a sight of
them

  in the evening chill his muscles had stiff-
ened in the short rest and when again he
took up his paddle it was only to torture
himself every muscle every nerve his
numbed brain cried for rest his eyes
ached he was too near exhaustion even
to realize that he was hungry

  the canoe swung straight on in the center
of the swiftest part sometimes stern first
sometimes broadside to the current he
was traveling without effort and darkness
would come soon he stretched himself
out in the bottom and instantly was
asleep

  dick was wakened by the sudden stop-
ping of the canoe and a swirling of water
against its side dazed stiff his brain as
cramped as his body he lifted himself and
looked around the sun was high the
canoe had come to rest on the end of a sand-
bar opposite the base of a bluff which tow-
ered nearly four hundred feet above the
stream and against which the river dashed
furiously only to be swung out again into
the center of the broad valley

  on the sandbar was dry driftwood and
dick crawled out and started a fire there
was a long stretch of water behind him but
so far as he could see he was alone birds
sang a fish sometimes flipped above the

adventure

surface but otherwise there was no move-
ment no sound of life he cooked break-
fast and his strength and alertness revived
immediately cursed himself for his folly in
so exposing himself to the pursuing ouini-
begous he shoved off and began to pad-
dle as swiftly as the day before

      when nightfall came again dick
mggb began to believe that he was no
longer followed the savages had
not suspected his going down the ouisconsin
past the portage they were probably
seeking for him there believing that he
had turned aside before he reached it or had
attempted to paddle through to the river
that led to lac mecheygan all day he
had made his two leagues an hour had
passed through a country as beautiful as
any he had ever seen and yet there had
been no sign of human habitation

  he and goddin had often talked with the
ouinibegous during the winter in an effort
to learn something of the great water
that lay to the westward but no member
of the tribe had ever been to it though they
believed that it was only a few days pad-
dle down the ouisconsin it was a great
water they said on its shores strange
fierce nations dwelt and beneath its surface
were great monsters that swallowed whole
canoes and all that was in them at a gulp
none of their people had ever dared ven-
ture so far they would not risk it now

  in the darkness dick again abandoned
himself to the current and stretched out in
the bottom of the canoe when morning
came he found that some miracle had kept
him off the sandbars all night and he was
still drifting now straight west in the same
cliff-bound valley with his breakfast
came confidence that he need no longer fear
pursuit and for the first time he gave
thought to the problem that now confronted
him the body beneath the blanket in
the bow must be buried this necessity
redoubled his loneliness and his sense of
loss but it also brought an idea he set
the canoe afloat and began to paddle

  now with the bluffs towering above him
on the right now swinging at the base of a
high cliff on the left turning from side to
side of the broad valley dick kept on with
the current the river had become a great
noble stream as beautiful as any he had
ever seen he had gone so far to the south
since the murder of goddin he found the

leaves budding the land green with the
vividness of spring the little islands
with which the channel was dotted lay like
huge emeralds before him the towering
bluffs had entirely lost their ruggedness
beneath their new cloaks of verdure the
valley was a broad prairie studded with
clumps of oaks

  at noon the hills came close to the water
on either side and then the river swung
around a bend and straightened out into
a long expanse which broadened at the far
end beneath a line of high hills for two
leagues the water was unbroken except for
a few small islands directly in front on
the left a long ridge rose nearly four hundred
feet above him and on the right low oak-
covered hills gave way to a broad prairie

  for a moment the sheer beauty and
grandeur of the scene held dick breathless

  not even the river that flows into the
sea at new amsterdam excels it he
whispered

  and then the significence of what he saw
impelled itself and he knew that even then
his speeding canoe was at the mouth of the
ouisconsin that he the first of white men
was looking upon the great water the
upper reaches of the misisepe

  dazed by the magnificence of this won-
derful confluence of the two waters dick
sat motionless only unconsciously keeping
the canoe headed with the current the
force of the water swept him on past the
islands and then the view opened before
him to the north and south for leagues in
either direction he could see the great
river to the south it was broad un-
broken stretching from bluff to bluff to
the north it widened the channel studded
by many islands washing at the base of the
hills on the west and at the edge of a prairie
on the east not until its strong quiet
sweeping current caught and whirled him
away to the south did dick begin to paddle

  straight on toward the west he went
where a mountain towered above the water
the current became swifter not the bub-
bling swirling twisting water he had known
in the ouisconsin but a silent powerful
drift a force entirely in accord with the
majesty of such a stream

  swept down fighting steadily at last
catching a huge eddy dick finally reached
the base of the mountain on the western
side and beached his canoe immediately
above him twenty feet higher than the
before marquette



water directly facing the entrance of the
ouisconsin and commanding a broad sweep
of the great river itself was the bare crown
of a knoll

  he set to work at once with his ax he
made a rough spade with which to dig a
shallow grave in the rocky soil he was
forced to cut out a thwart in the canoe to
remove the body of goddin but he reached
the knoll with it and laid it in the slight
depression over it he built up a tomb of
stones as high as his shoulders then he
hewed from a dry driftwood log a plank in
which he burned deeply with the heated
end of his ramrod this inscription

         antoine goddin
         he served his people

  oh antoine cried dick as he stepped
back and looked at the result of his work
if you could only know but you must
know you must know that you he in the
land you sought beyond the great water 

  in the spell of the emotion which gripped
him dick stood for a time beside the tomb
of his friend in the first moments he was
overpowered by a sense of loneliness on
the ouisconsin there had always been the
fear of being overtaken by the ouinibegous
now he seemed to realize for the first time
that he was more completely more utterly
alone than man had ever been before

  in that moment there was no room for
thought of the glory of his achievement
if there were gladness it was only because he
had been able to lay the body of his friend
on the shore of the great water that he
had desired so in life that beside it he might
peacefully sleep away the ages and watch
perhaps the coming of the people for whom
he had planned and hoped

  loneliness and grief dick suffered too but
somehow it was no longer the former un-
reconciled bitterness in its place had
come a quiet sorrowful acceptance of the
fact that he must say good-by to the only
man he had ever really loved and travel
alone on the great water hundreds of
leagues from the nearest of his race com-
pletely surrounded by thousands and thou-
sands of savages

gradually despite his grief and
his loneliness the one great thought
impressed itself he the first of the
white race had found that for which men
had toiled and hoped through a century

he of the colony of virginia in one short
year had done what the french had sought
to do for scores of years he had been
driven to it had reached the river when
fleeing from certain death at the hands of
savages but nothing could detract from
the indisputable fact that he was there
that he had found the great water that
to him had come the distinction of being
first

  he looked up and down the broad reaches
of the stream across to the ouisconsin up
to the towering cliffs and bluffs never
he thought had he looked upon a grander
a more imposing scene except that he
knew he was far to the west of lac mechey-
gan he had no knowledge of the country in
which he found himself what this misi-
sepe was whence it came where it finally
reached the sea he could not even guess
where he stood it flowed straight south
bending slightly toward the east but for
all he could tell it might swerve off to the
west and the gulf of california or to the
east and the coast of the western ocean
south of virginia

  behind him was a deep ravine that
seemed to offer an opportunity to scale the
bluff and see more of the beautiful land
that lay about him and impulsively he
started toward it

   deep into the heart of the hills he went
his path darkened by great maples and elms
and oaks a tiny stream trickled over
rocks and undr moss and as the ravine
narrowed he was forced back and forth
across it sometimes straight up its bed
suddenly he was confronted by cliffs that
rose straight up past the tops of the tallest
trees the water had cut and worn them
and the rough surface was brilliant with
alternate strata of many colors

  still following the bed of the stream
dick came at last to a pool at the base of a
cliff from the top the water fell in a
broad thin sheet as he looked up he saw
that his only course lay behind the water-
fall a ledge offered slippery footing and
he passed back of the cascade around the
edge of the falls and up into a broader
ravine

  here he turned to the left up a steep
slope clothed with oaks and at last pushing
through a fringe of brush came out with
startling suddenness upon the point of the
bluff

  dick could not repress an exclamation


adventure

of amazement far to the north and the
south stretched the great river its width
was a measure of the mighty valley of which
it was the center the glint of the sun from
its surface was only a flash of the bright-
ness of a vast land the hazy distance en-
shrouded its coming and going and yet in-
vited pleasant journeying into the mystery
beyond

  the river itself held a peculiar power in
its vastness its silent majestic incontest-
able might there was no hurry no tur-
moil calm dignified peaceful it lay there
the great artery through which flowed the
life of the worlds wonderland

  directly opposite dick opened the mouth
of the ouisconsin most beautiful of water-
ways as far as he could see in either
direction steep rounded heavily-wooded
bluffs hemmed in the misisepe on the west
to the east and north lay a broad green
plain which to dick could have been in-
tended by the maker only for the nurture of
a coming race the whole land in fact
seemed dormant expectant lying ready

  what an empire cried the virginian
aloud nothing could be more fair than
this it is as antoine said the land for a
strong happy race of people if only he
might have lived to see it

  the mention of his friends name brought
a realization of what his friend had longed
for what he had planned and worked for
what had been so cruelly denied him and
what had now been given to one who had
not even striven for it

  the thought brought a sense of humility
and of responsibility not when he had
revolted at the rape of the islinois not when
he had avenged the death of antoine god-
din not when he had knelt beside his dying
friend did dick jeffreys emerge from the
chrysalis of youth it remained for this
knowledge that he had found a new land
the land of which antoine goddin had
dreamed to stiffen the fibers of his soul to
bring him face to face with responsibility
and duty

  for a time dick stood there dizzy with
the idea failing to grasp anything more than
the present then antoines dying words
returned to him and the thought and the
trust behind them

  the fur is only the beginning this fair
land was not meant for savages who spend

their lives in killing and torturing i know
that you will have the vision that you will
do your share you will have done your
duty to your fellow-men no i will not
ask a promise your king will do as well
for it can never be a kings land but a land
of honest happy people

  not for your sake antoine he said
aloud not for the sake of any man
you said once that a king is only a symbol
to you a symbol of that which holds a
people together you were right my
friend you were honest and brave and
you had the vision i can do no better
than follow

  he walked forward to the very edge of
the cliff and there silhouetted against the
april sky high above the mighty river he
cried in a loud voice

  in the name of the people of england
and through their king charles the second
i claim this land

  he turned chose a giant oak several
paces behind him and began to hew away
one side when he had a broad flat sur-
face he built a fire heated his ramrod and
burned into the wood the words he had cried
to the heavens a few minutes before

  with some difficulty he counted the days
since antoine had been shot and thereby
arrived at the date beneath his inscrip-
tion he burned

april  

  dick did not even dream that two months
later to the day two canoes would appear
between the islands far up the ouisconsin
and that as he had doue a few hours be-
fore louis joliet representative of the
french king and jacques marquette
jesuit with five french voyageurs would
sweep out into the current of the misisepe

  dicks thoughts were elsewhere before
him lay six or seven hundred leagues of
wilderness thousands upon thousands of
savages hunger and toil and privation
possibly torture and death and at the end
of it all sir william berkeley with his
hatred and his noose

  he did not falter for an instant his
face was stem his eyes steady and bright
with a new zeal he turned swiftly down
the side of the bluff with a glad shout-
back to virginia

to be concluded
seeds of wrath

author of no brains on short allowance etc

      t was not the sacrilege alone
i  that made the reverend john
v my mctodd arise with sudden red
rage when imbi tossed the gilded
crucifix off the home-made bamboo table
in the lamp-lit bungalow and grinned im-
pudently it was the calm insolence of
the half-naked savage that seemed with
one stroke to rub in six months of sneering
effrontery from all his evil tribe

  mctodd came to partial sanity to find
the leg of a shattered chinese bench in his
hand and himself bending over a prostrate
imbi whose brownish face was running red
to his own surprise the missionary found
himself not thinking in christian horror
of his attack on a fellow-man but seeming
to listen as if in a sardonic trance to words
spoken months before by the portly round-
faced secretary of the board of foreign
missions who sent him to this fiendish
island

  use tact gentleness kindness in-
structed the well-groomed and fatherly
secretary in his comfortable new york
office the work is dangerous and i
honor you for having chosen it these
people are real savages you must win
their friendship by ignoring minor irrita-
tions and making them look up to you
for moral and spiritual guidance we look
to you for results in keeping with your
education enterprise and magnificent phys-
ical condition remember above all stick

to those three things tact gentleness
kindness

  tact snarled mctodd as the brown
form of imbi began to writhe into con-
sciousness ill tact you lets see where
ive started

  the missionary lifted the wobbling head
in a mighty arm and examined his handi-
work closer

  scalp wound he muttered lucky
i didnt kill him

  there was still no churchly regret in the
reverend john mctodd the softening
ties of the divinity school seemed to have
burst at one sudden explosion and made
him again the university man who had
mopped up whole football teams by his
own herculean strength and mad determi-
nation he splashed a rag in a bucket of
water and swabbed the tribesmans matted
forehead unemotionally until a realization
of his own position began to seep into his
brain and bring him up standing the
youth he struck was the son of a chieftain

  im done nodded the missionary as he
stared at his black shadow on the matted
wall oh well he shrugged his
shoulders it might as well come now
im sick of it all-sick of it and then
he gasped in a lightning-flash of self-dis-
coverv im talking to myself he yelled
clenching hairy hands till the nails bit into
his palms ive come to that im talk-
ing to myself




adventure

  six months of loneliness futility and sun-
heat had done it three months of self-
searching because of his failures had made
it worse filled with high ideals and
higher hopes he had come to this smelly
green-and-yellow island a smooth-shaven
blue-eyed blond giant among coffee-colored
pigmies he wanted to be friends

  he had prayed for these people smiled
upon them played with their babes tried
to insinuate the word into their intellect
but they only passed from curiosity to
aloofness and then to grinning mockery
until their monkey-like boycott had almost
driven him rabid he a man educated
to heights they never dreamed of was a
pariah among them and a mark for con-
temptl

  had he known what the chieftain had
said about him in solemn brush-lit council
in a grove of palms he might have under-
stood more

  the man is a fool said fat old makosa
in his native dialect while the firelight
glistened on the knives of his warriors
he has the stature of a mighty warrior
he talks of a god that does not appear and
sings woman-songs and plays with children
therefore his wits are gone

  it was not a simple matter of eliminating
the reverend john mctodd off-hand
that was tried on a previous white man
but some queer devil-boat appeared soon
thereafter and hurled lyddite and gun-
cotton through village and palm-grove till
trees huts and islanders were blown into
one mass of spattered ruin since then the
tribe was less able to meet invading war-
riors makosa never forgot the lesson

  the incident was known to mctodd
but his own attack on a native placed him
in a different situation but something was
stirring his pulses strangely and he let it
grip him harder as he noted that imbi was
looking at him steadily without sign of
emotion like a silent reptile biding its time

  get out snapped mctodd pointing
with the bench-leg toward the veranda

  imbis head went down like a whipped
dogs and he limped along queerly on all
fours shuffling his knees at every move
and throwing grotesque shadows from the
lamplight he turned the corner of the
door and vanished leaving a sinister red
trail along the matting like a portent of
things to come mctodds lips tight-
ened

  its war he nodded its me against
em all well so be it im ready

i i a great load seemed to fall from
gi his shoulders no longer did he
 i have to meet these creatures with
gentleness seek their friendship turn the
other cheek he knew now that he loathed
the whole dirty tribe and owned a majestic
white mans contempt for them that he
never suspected before he had not been
a hypocrite he had striven mightily and
lashed his own soul when he failed he
had prayed for guidance night after night
seeking aid for his lonely heart while tom-
toms beat for orgy-dances on the beach
below

  at first when he looked up toward the
glaring tropic stars for comfort he thought
his prayers brought him surcease yet
lately those prayers had only rung in his
ears like hollow noises but now it was
different

  a hundred generations of warrior-clans-
men forefathers were whispering strange
tilings to his soul making his blood thrill
with pagan thoughts that had nothing to
do with church or creed he half-realized
he was running amuck but though his
flinty scotch conscience railed at him it
only made him worse through defiance of it
he had crossed his rubicon and thrown
aside his cross

  im a christian no longer he muttered
and i might as well make a good job of it

  mctodds glance fell on a little black
prayer-book with gilded edges on the green
cloth under his reading-lamp he picked
it up and tossed it far out of the door
smiling grimly while it rustled through the
hrush the crucifix on the floor next
caught his attention it was given him by
a catholic priest who wished him well
the crucifix was just about to follow the
prayer-book when mctodd stopped him-
self his action was too much like imbis
instead he placed the gleaming thing on
the table carefully

  i have deserted my god he ruminated
but im not a savage-yet

  on the table was a letter on dainty blue
stationery now soiled by much thumbing
it had come to him in manila when he first
started for this island and even more than
the prayer-book it had been his comfort
the gracious daughter of the secretary of
the board of foreign missions had written
the seeds of wrath



it and shown her faith and affection in every
word he knew it by heart

  i know you will come back in triumph
because you can not fail it said you
will win the hearts of these people as you
won mine because of yourself and because
you will treat them in a way they can
understand

  there were to have been golden days
after mctodd made good on the island and
won his way to promotion that had been
thoroughly understood

  mctodd smiled tiredly the letter had
taken him through many a trouble and put
heart into him but now it was like a thing
from some past age still sacred because of
its memories but without influence

  i can not fail he laughed while the
walls echoed the sound weirdly win the
hearts of these people huh-ill win em
if they get within range

  acting on that idea mctodd went to a
trunk in his bedroom and dug out a fine
navy revolver it worked perfectly and
the cartridges fitted and that was all the
man cared to know just then

  it was the calm before the storm and the
lonely man sensed it as he walked to the
veranda and took a look about above
the stars shone with tropic boldness to
his right beyond the fronds of a big palm
tree the dim firelights of a hut village
flickered to his left a black mountain
sloped upward to a grim crater silent for
many decades ahead below the cliff on
which the bungalow stood the pacific
pounded on the reefs and bellowed its
thundering sea-song or showed its phos-
phorescent breakers on the beach below
the village into mctodds nostrils came
sweetish dampish smells from foliage too
thick for its acreage into his strained ears
came no human sound

 for ten minutes the big tow-headed
scotsman in white drill stood like a sentinel
and then came the pattering of feet on the
gravel below the bungalow the natives
were coming mctodd stepped into the
house sat down picked up a book and pre-
tended to read he found his heart beating
strangely but his nerves steady as a rock
and he only looked up again when eight
brownish figures had crowded through the
doorway and the lamplight glittered on
the steel of their big cruel knives

  it was a motley delegation of undersized
half-humans baleful head-hunter eyes

stared from under matted mops of black
hair rainbow-colored loin-cloths-blue
green yellow red-flashed fantastically
with ever move of queerly-shaped bodies
and thin bent legs the leader had the
greenest cloth of all the biggest knife the
thinnest crudest face it was taafa sub-
chief and prime-devil now frankly angry

  what for you bang imbi he de-
maded in an outburst of traders english

  because imbi was fresh returned the
white man equally frank

  the word was new to taafa

  fraish he snarled what fraish

  the devil within mctodd made him
show his disdain for the sub-chief

  that is none of your business he
replied quite evenly

  the words were not understood but the
inflection was eight hands went to sword-
hilts seven stayed there but the great
blade of taafa flashed out with a sweep of
his scrawny arm

  what for you bang imbi he roared
again then he stuttered you-you

go away-quick he pointed with the

sword toward the ocean and continents
beyond you go-go-go he screamed
you go other place quick you no go-

  he flexed his wrist and made the sword
sing through the air

  so returned mctodd coolly that
means im invited to leave the island well
you leave the bungalow you savvy
you go-go-git

  and he arose to full height and pointed
toward the door he had stood six months
of insult and now he was through for good

incredulity and amazement
showed for an instant on the scarred
face of the savage and then he let his
natural impulses flow forgetting the lesson
of the bombardment forgetting everything

  yah he shrieked brandishing his
sword and advancing on mctodd fero-
ciously while the others yelled and prepared
for action

  the temper of the savages was up so
was mctodds the air was electric it
was war

  the missionary took a step backward
when the sharp blade cut the air toward
him and then he went mad-violent
berserk mad he crashed a mighty sledge-
hammer fist with all his strength into
taafas face the sub-chief went limp


adventure

and slumped to the floor while the other
screaming islanders came on with their
knives mctodd whipped out the pistol
he fired into the thick of them while the
bungalow rocked with the thunder

  one came under the weapon got brushed
aside by a frantic elbow and slipped up
behind him grinning evilly the white
man whirled and smashed the screaming
savage through the flimsy wall the
bungalow stood on a rock alongside a ravine

  an agile figure dodged up to mctodd
as he turned again the point of a knife
just touched his ribs the maddened
scotsman struck with the pistol-butt in his
fingers and the native dropped silently

  clear for an instant mctodd leveled
the pistol and pulled the trigger fast
the first wild shot missed a figure jumping
toward him the next did not neither
did the other three the place was filled
with acrid smoke spitting flame shrieking
dancing fighters and the roar of powder-
explosions until at last when the white man
pulled trigger only an empty click resulted

  with one forearm the panting sweating
mctodd brushed away the perspiration
trickling into his eyes and his sight took
quick account of the scene only one
brownish figure faced him a poisonous little
reptile with curved knife in hand hesitating
whether to attack or run the blond giant
grimly reversed the pistol in his hand and
started with the butt to finish the job
stepping over dark figures that were either
still or quivering the last native gave a
yell of terror and vanished

  that means more are coming panted
mctodd unsteadily

  the conqueror looked about the room
it was a wreck his chairs were splintered
the pictures on the wall had crashed down
his desk was overturned the side-wall
toward the ravine was half-gone and on
the floor brown figures with green and
yellow and red loin-cloths were huddled
queerly their knives glinting on the reddish
matting between them taafa the sub-
chief had come to consciousness and was
starting to rise but when he saw the
scotsmans gaze upon him he played dead
quickly

  mctodd allowed himself a bitter smile
his brain was working fast

  a hostage he murmured thickly a
loaf of bread a box of cartridges and
thou-until some boat arrives

  the white giant strode to taafa grabbed
him by the scruff of the neck as he would
a snarling dog dodged a snapping attempt
to bite swung him to his legs rushed him
into the bedroom and tied his hands and
feet with a rope after that the pistol was
reloaded and the missionary sat on the bed
to get his breath and consider his next move
while taafa writhed around the floor

  the white mans absent-minded glance
roved to the front room where the huddled
brown figures were lying under the garish
light from a lamp that still burned as if
seeing the sight for the first time mctodd
stiffened and gasped then buried his face
in trembling remorseful hands

  and i came here to preach peace and
good will he sobbed brokenly

  the reaction had set in he began to
tremble jhe pit of his stomach seemed
gone he felt alone-terribly frightfully
alone like a child sweating from a bad
dream and peering into the darkness the
fronds of the palms murmured in the wind
outside and he jumped from sheer cat-
nervousness then looked out of a window
toward the quiet stars finding no comfort
because blood-guilt was on his conscience
and he and his god had parted company
he shivered as with a chill

  and then mctodd noted the vicious fae
of taafa leering below him and his fighting
spirit returned hatred called to hatred
louder than the call of conscience or soften-
ing influences the snarling little devil
seemed to typify all the bitter humiliations
and defeats the white man had suffered and
mctodd longed to throttle him but taafa
was too valuable as a hostage

 that brought up the question of
mctodds immediate future should he
hide in the brush with taafa and dodge
from thicket to thicket a mark for any
spear while he slept or should he face the
whole crowd where he was and bargain
with them beat them or go down like a
white man

  his jaw set mctodd decided to stay to
the finish even though the native who fled
had already spread the alarm through
village and palm-grove

the fleeing one had come upon old
makosa squatting in front of his hut
and chatting with two of his con-
freres the runner burst upon them in
great excitement and haste neglecting to
the seeds of wrath



mention that he had taken time to cut
himself so as to show honorable wounds of
mortal combat

  the white man has gone quite mad
panted the wide-eyed bearer of tidings
seven are gone and i alone stood him off
until my wounds drained my strength he
is quite mad

  the old chiefs nut-brown face skewered
into many wrinkles and he scratched the
dazzling white wool of his head while
tribesmen came running to hear the tale-
bearers story embellished with liner detail
as the crowd augmented and ending with a
frenzy of words when it was all over
makosa arose slowly and counted noses

  you have heard what shall be done
he asked

  cruel faces snarled monkey-like savage-
looking knives were fondled and voices
chattered shrilly in the crowd that swirled
about the fat-stomached spindle-shanked
old chieftain

  here snarled a warrior stretching out
a curved blade are we children to stand
here talking what are these for

  and have another devil-boat throw ruin
into us reminded makosa

  the crafty old chieftain was thinking
hard leaving aside the terrible lesson
given two years before by a big cruiser
with a most demoniac battery makosa saw
the big blond white missionary as a state
problem in himself seven men were
gone-seven warriors from a thinned com-
munity which already had trouble to ward
off raiders who came annually

  from a high hill on a clear day makosa
could look across the pacifics sunlit waters
and see the faint blue mountain-tops of
chandapan whose people had never been
bombarded and-who owned anuoying war-
canoes to makosa seven fighters meant
something-and the blond white giant still
had that pistol

  but the man is mad-mad-mad
chattered the runner still haranguing
public opinion

  enough roared makosa he is not
mad he is come to sanity look you
his mind has been the mind of a witless
child and his body the body of a mighty
warrior he sang for women and played
with children he spoke of a gospel
advising meekness before all enemies being
quite demented but now his brain is
cleared he thinks of women and children

and meekness no longer he is come to
sanity he is a warrior i shall see him

  and thereupon the chieftain did so

  the scene at the interview was as formal
as a meeting of mandarins colorful as a
vivid picture by some splashy impressionist
grim as the slumbering old volcano that
towered above the lamplit bungalow ma-
kosa in state regalia consisting of a sword
two daggers and a purple-and-yellow sash
waddled through the bungalow door fol-
lowed by his choicest warriors with the
spear-carrying populace massed behind him

  further inside the room the cold-eyed
mctodd faced them stiffly holding the
blue-steel pistol ready in his right hand and
keeping the bound and mutilated taafa
before him as an exhibit and a hostage
the lamplight gleamed impartially on white
steel and blue steel that seemed to shimmer
with the electricity in the air

  when workmen had cleared away the
huddled heap of lost warriors the grunting
makosa squatted on the matting like some
distorted buddha come to give judgment
the rest of the warriors did likewise and
seeing it was not war but palaver mctodd
warily seated himself on the arm of a bat-
tered chair wondering what was coming
next

  in trade-english makosa opened with
accusations concerning imbi and seven
warriors mctodd responded with coun-
ter-accusations throwing in frank opinions
of the whole tribe starting with makosa
and working down brown forms behind
the chieftain began to sway restlessly like
long grass in a breeze but makosa held
out a commanding hand and the murmuring
subsided

  then the chieftain began to talk in
earnest picking words slowly from his small
vocabulary and as he went along the
white mans face showed alternate amaze-
ment calculation wariness and relief
it was a cold proposition to unfold to a
missionary who came to preach a gospel
of gentleness but it brought a glint of hope
to his eyes for at least it offered a way out-
if it were sincere

  you-you mean you want me to join
your warriors blurted the dazed white
man after makosa had finished

  the old chief nodded affirmatively and
mctodds eyes narrowed

   it may be treachery and it may be true
he muttered its worth considering


adventure

  his searching level glance met makosas
and he found it hard to conceal his loathing
of the dirty little fat savage but he did it
by laughing mirthlessly

  and i was a christian missionary oh
well ive almost gone the whole distance
now-whats the difference he nodded
to the chieftain all right ill take you
up but ill be the boss understand
theres going to be discipline he re-
lapsed into trade-english pointing a finger
white man say you do you do you no do
white man shoot

  makosa caught the general idea and
nodded grave approval for the wily old
chieftain estimated this six-foot-three white-
skin to be a most desirable ally thus the
palaver was concluded after which makosa
arose and blandly started to waddle toward
taafa thinking fast the white man
decided to let the sneering little devil go
so he stood aside while the general populace
started to file out

  severing taafas cords makosa started
to leave also but his eye caught the gleam-
ing crucifix on the table half-forgetting
mctodd he began to edge toward it
when he got in front of the table he turned
as if to look toward taafa but his left hand
was behind him

  drop that snarled mctodd jumping
toward him here you dirty little thief-
let go of that

  he wrenched the crucifix out of the chiefs
hand while warriors in the doorway turned
and stood irresolutely mctodd found his
anger seething up again

  ive a notion to ram it down your
throat he roared into the livid face of old
makosa

  then another thought struck him

  no-here you take it he thundered
youll keep it now and every day ill
demand an accounting it will keep you
out of mischief i hereby appoint you
the grand chief bearer of loot now
go-git and he pointed toward the
doorway

  the old chief grabbed the glittering thing
thrust into his hand and fairly flew out of
the door knocking aside swordsmen com-
ing to his rescue who stood uncertainly
for a moment before following him for
council when they had gone clamoring
down the hill the big white man stood alone
in his battered living-room his temper
sagging away again

  and i have fallen even to this sacrilege
he murmured bowiqg his head well
so be it he straightened again and his
mouth set in a grim line i am no better
than my fellow-savages-as is proper
and now that ive started ill make em
better warriors dead or alive

filled with this aggressive reso-
lution mctodd strode to the village
next morning still half expecting to
be surrounded and killed but prepared for
anything dirty brown warriors gave him
strange half-awed and half-hateful looks
but none molested him even though he
walked into the hut of the chief

  get your gang together ordered
mctodd pointing to a cleared field the
white man seemed like a person possessed
of the demon of energy so old makosa
nodded and ordered his crowd to work
not without first accounting for that
crucifix

  now well have some drilling an-
nounced mctodd to the spearmen who
straggled out past him its long since
i was in the university cadets but you wont
know the difference anyhow hey you-
turn around-go other way

  he grabbed a warrior and shoved him
toward the field briskly subconsciously
he was glorying in his unhallowed leader-
ship he had been a pariah here this
was different

  sorting out his wondering savages by
stature separating swordsmen from spear-
men the white giant finally managed to
aline his dubious rabble of brown non-
descripts and teach them elemental com-
mands in terse english at first the crowd
gave interest and squirmed through easy
evolutions because it was novel but within
an hour the ranks began to sag and indiffer-
ence took place of obedience

  then mctodd commenced to assert his
discipline with calculated audacity

  the first savage who fell out of line was
cuffed and shoved back the second was
kicked and straightened up the third
was knocked down instantly and scowls
began to meet the white man from every
side but he did not care now he meant
to overcome them right at the start once
after two hours of it they started for him
but the ready pistol-muzzle came forth and
they fell back

  mctodd knew he was arrogant over-
the seeds of wrath



bearing even brutal but the memory of
those six months of purgatory was with
him always he would either master these
half-humans or go down shooting for a
time it looked as if he were going down
he felt like a lion-tamer able to face these
wild creatures but loath to turn his back

  then makosa arrived still clutching that
gilded crucifix mctodd gave him public
obeisance and led him to the front rank
and made him stand there the queer old
man in the purple-and-yellow breech-cloth
holding that gleaming thing became the
center of all attention mctodd noted the
change and smiled mirthlessly he was
learning a chieftain holding an emblem
in the front rank means something the
world over mctodd kept him there for
good and through this miracle the first day
passed and the white giant- had gone far
toward establishing mastery

  seven days the implacable scotsman
drilled the natives with the aid of tongue
fist and pistol and by the eighth they
could swing by him in solid ranks answer-
ing to his iron discipline some had given
trouble but these were knocked to the
ground relentlessly and somehow in place
of black looks mctodd noted he was
getting more willing obedience after that
it was easier he had them under control

  it was a different mctodd now he had
become a bearded coatless athlete with the
terse manners of a truckman and the bark-
ing voice of a drill-sergeant he was no
longer the gentle churchman he never
expected to be one again but at least he
was now a master and intended to remain
so until a trading-schooner came to take
him away

  on the ninth day the natives felt impelled
to start a weird rhythmic chant that ran
from rank to rank as they marched until it
swelled to the full four hundred voices
mctodd stood the ghoulish noise as long as
he could then-

  stop that he barked

  slowly the crooning died away and
questioning eyes turned toward the white
man and made him embarrassed though
that noise gave him the creeps it was not
policy to stop the natural chanting of
marching men

  here he yelled after an awkward
pause if you must sing learn music
his mind cast about for something but he
knew little except the tunes of the clergy

all right he shouted recklessly sing
this

            onward christian soldiers

            marching as to war

          with the cross-

  the sacrilege seemed to stick in his
scotch throat but he shrugged his shoulders
it was no worse than the rest of this busi-
ness so mctodd finished in a roaring voice
that seemed to have defiance in it and
gradually little by little the mass of brown
figures took it up imitatively as the white
man chanted it over and over again

they sang it when the men of
chandapan came in war-canoes one
morning ready to sweep all before
them mctodds spearmen sang it when
they charged in a solid disciplined phalanx
as the invaders swarmed to the beach and
the white mans pistol spat into them
mctodds swordsmen sang it when they
grappled at close quarters his bowmen
did not sing at first because they were
cleverly concealed by squads in ambush
but later all joined in the chorus while six
big upturned war-canoes floated dolefully
up to the sands and still later they roared
it in mad celebration while the white man
tried to sleep in his bungalow and wondered
how soon a sail would appear

  he was master and arbiter of the island
and yet he was strangely uncomfortable
for at night his searching scotch conscience
asked him questions that he could not
answer except by defiance

  he had come a christian and a gentle-
man he would leave as a hard-hitting
reckless masterful brutal adventurer unfit
to mingle with christians because his
christianity was a frail thing that fell away
like a thin coat of shellac when his mighty
muscles obeyed a pagan temper thus he
reasoned during the long nights when that
conscience made him squirm to its merciless
lash

  in the old times he had winced from
humiliation when the sun was up but slept
like a child when night came now by
day he bullied and domineered like a man
who did not care and at night he writhed
as the weeks lengthened into months he
found his alternate arrogance and self-
abasement worse until the nights became
a terror and to keep his mind occupied
he stayed as late as possible around the


adventure

village-fires of his people holding arbitrary
inspections concerning personal cleanliness
listening to their cases at law giving ir-
revocable judgments doling out medicines
for their ills and teaching them to chant
the sacred songs he knew while he beat
time ironically on a goat-skin drum

  and at last a sail appeared

  relieved and yet more scared because
it brought to a focus the problem of his
future the white giant with a lump in his
throat watched the thing grow from a tiny
speck on the horizon to a good-sized
auxiliary schooner that cast anchor off
the beach and lowered a boat but before
the schooner had come within two miles
of shore mctodd had shaved donned
decent clothes and even composed himself
for the first step toward the inevitable con-
fession of his ghastly failure

  he managed to pull himself together and
start toward his crisis manfully but when
he returned among his dusky minions on
the beach he rubbed his eyes at what he
saw and trembled as if with palsy

  that lissome white-clad figure alongside
the portly man in the boat calling and
waving to him-where had he seen it before
he passed a hand over his muddled head
and pieced the matter out slowly from a
flood of memories it had lived as his
dark-eyed queen in a castle-of-dreams
among roses and geraniums and shady
nooks and sunlit meadows in some distant
rainbow-land where gentle beings with fair
skins held human companionship and rarely
knocked each other down it did not
belong on this ferocious island the thing
was incongruous-like a white fairy wander-
ing into hell

  mctodd pinched himself to see if he were
awake but he was for the radiant vision
in tailor-made garments was stepping off
the beached boat and its hand touched his
and its beautiful rounded face with the red
lips smiled into his until the smile changed
to a look of horrified amazement and then
to infinite pity and tenderness

  john she gasped taking him into her
anxious arms like a protecting mother

  it was only one word but its vibrant
compassion thrilled his soul and tied his
tongue so he could only hold her mutely
as if afraid she would vanish into dreams
again

  john-the lines on your face she
drew away a little appraising him in-

tently and the terrible look in your
eyes oh my poor big boy how you must
have suffered

  and he saw the tears of pity glisten and
wondered what to say

  some-some others suffered too he
muttered idiotically

  she quivered and drew a little further
away and studied him very thoughtfully
making his heart sink by dropping his hand
and shaking her head a stout american
gentleman in business clothes-the secre-
tary of the board of foreign missions-
stepped in front of her and grasped mc-
todds listless hand and shook it but his
smile too vanished as he looked into
mctodds somber face and he turned to the
girl getting a quiet nod and understand-
ing it 

  come john requested the man
gently as he took one of mctodds arms
and the girl took the other let us go to
your bungalow and talk come john

  it was a coaxing part-commanding
voice that almost tempted the quick-acting
mctodd to show who was master right
there but it was also a friendly voice so
he allowed himself to be led along like a
dull child while those beside him exchanged
glances

  they ate inside the bungalow with the
secretary talking of everything but the
island and the work and gradually
mctodds ear became used to the speech
of gentlefolk and his mind became saner
as if he were starting to shake off the thrall
of a terrible nightmare the secretary
only lost his conversational control once and
that was after mctodd had stared past
the palm trees outdoors to the sinister reef
where surf lashed about in frothing rage
like a baffled thing eternally hurled back
oy demons

  ive failed rasped mctodd suddenly
crashing a heavy fist on the table im
through-ive failed

  his defiant eyes met the startled ones of
the others and he began to rise as if to
have it out but the secretary tugged at his
sleeve pleadingly

  let us enjoy ourselves now and forget
the rest urged the elderly man later
you can show us your island and your work
and then perhaps we may judge

  mctodd took the hint and listened
patiently thereafter to the tale of the
secretarys travels while on his tour of in-
the seeds of wrath



spection and later when his hour of
paradise was over mctodd decided with
a sigh to let his guests -see conditions for
themselves without his telling them thus
he left them in the bungalow and went
below to summon his people and put them
through their paces so that his visitors could
visualize the thing explanations would
then be needless-and useless

lining up his warriors mctodd
gave them terse directions and
went back to the bungalow and
brought his thoughtful wondering guests
to a little knoll he did not tell them he
was planning a queer military review nor
did the astonished visitors have an inkling
until solid ranks of brown warriors keeping
step marched out of a grove of trees into
a meadow below the hill

  subconsciously mctodd found himself
curious as to how his savages would act
under their own leaders it was his first
chance to stand away from it all and look
over his handiwork and he was quickly
forced to admit that his cynical handiwork
was good he even found himself owning
an apologetic vanity in the matter

  holding weapons rigidly in their right
hands swinging their left arms in broad
arcs like russian grenadiers the little
savages that mctodd had terrorized into
discipline were merged into a compact
businesslike machine that obeyed the eng-
lish commands of its leaders instantly
first came makosa carrying the emblem
then the prime swordsmen swung across
the field in four ranks of twenty-odd men
each keeping perfect alinement behind
them a hundred spears bobbed and flashed
in the sun flanked on either side by bow-
men and skirmishers whose left arms
swayed rhythmically as they walked

  some one started singing the others
took it up and soon the chorus rolled from
rank to rank-the grand old hymn of
christianity quaintly distorted in the
queer savage wording

  on-gwa clifton so-jass-

  mctodd glanced toward the secretary
at his left and saw the mans jaw drooped
in petrified amazement when he looked
around there was something like admiration
in his quizzical eyes but mctodd quickly
shifted his glance to the girl at his right
he only saw her straight profile she was
staring below and on her face was a deeper

color than he had ever seen before he
found himself trembling

  and you have failed came her vibrant
voice queerly intoned

  yes he murmured unsteadily i-
i did not come here to train warriors
perhaps you had to she replied and
maybe you builded better than you knew
look she pointed a white-clad arm
toward the swinging black column that
was counter-marching you came here
to teach these people at least the forms of
our religion hear them they are sing-
ing the song of that religion

  she turned to him and in her eyes he saw
a great admiration and triumph as though
he had justified all her mighty faith

  its-its splendid she cried they
have been taught law and order they
are clean and neat they have learned
discipline why-its perfect even the
cross is going on before do you see
and she pointed toward the fat old chief-
tain holding the emblem in his right
hand

  as if a binding had been stricken from
his eyes mctodd gasped electrified at
what he saw he rubbed his eyes awake
at last in a flash of vivid understanding
he realized that he had planted the seed he
had come to plant and opened the ground
he had come to open he was the plow-
man he had used dynamite because the
soil was hard but now the top crust was
softened and those who came after him
need only be the cultivators the children
of these savages could be friends to civiliza-
tion forevermore mctodd knew at last
that he had not failed

  the white mans methods had been
harsh and brutal he had been goaded
to things unthinkable in his sane and
christian state he had killed he had
denied his creator but now his head
bowed and tears ran unashamed down his
cheeks

  i see it all now he choked i am
his servant after all

  the girl patted his shoulder tenderly

  i know she agreed you always
were we all are with you it was only
a question of making these people under-
stand you

  mctodd looked away suddenly for he
felt the old demon of grimness gripping him
again-for the last time

  i did he nodded
making good
   for muley

 

wctuttlo

author of a prevaricated paradeloco or love etc

f theres a word of truth in
that old saying about beauty
being only skin deep susie
abernathy was the thinnest-
skinned person i ever saw i may not be a
judge of womanly beauty and the poetry
of my soul may have been shook loose by
pitching broncos and buried deep under a
coating of alkali dust but i sure do sabe
when a woman is hard to look at

  seems to me like its human nature for a
feller with squirrel-teeth no jaw to speak
about and a physique like a corn cultivator
to marry a beautiful female and vice versa
-not that muley bowles qualifies in the
beauty division but at that i reckon he
shaded susie a little

  muley was a poetical puncher of con-
siderable avoirdupois and he found susie
a thing of beauty and a joy forever susie
was a niece of zeb abernathy who owned
a sheep outfit on willow creek and a
grouch toward all cowmen-and muley
punched cows for the cross j outfit and
drew forty a month from old man
whittaker

  im not belittling muleys salary cause
i drew the same and so did telescope
tolliver and chuck warner back in the
dim and distant past when cows first
come into style the old-timers got to-
gether and settled the pay of the average
cow-hand

  they figured that any normal puncher-

if there is such an animal-would try at least
three turns of the roulette wheel at ten
dollars per turn that left him ten dollars
hed buy some tobacco some red neckties
and perfume and what was left at two-bits
a drink for hooch would just carry him a
few inches short of the murder and sudden
death stage

  ive just been up to the house to draw my
stipend from the old man and am on my
way back to the bunk-house when muley
rides in hes humped over in his saddle
like misery going to a cemetery and if you
can stamp despair on a full-sized milk-
cheese he had it on his face

  he slips his saddle off turns his bronc
into the corral leans against the fence and
cuts loose the granddaddy of all sighs
there aint many men that you can hear
sigh at pointblank range for a - but
you could with muley it was like re-
leasing the air on a freight train

  i wanders down there and passes the time
of day with him but he dont respond he
exhausts deep into his soul once more and
hangs up his saddle

  some of your relatives die muley
i asks

  hello hen says he sad-like i aint
got no relatives-except one aunt i dont
know whether shes alive or not

  name of bowles

  nope names allender maws name
was allender and thats why i was named
making good for muley



lemule allender and-what do you want
to know for

  you sighed a couple of times i reminds
him and he nods and looks off across the
range

  henry how can i make some money
regular money i cant get along on forty
a month-no more

  you aim to marry susie abernathy
i asks

  muley digs a little trench with the
toe of his boot and shakes his head sad-
like-

  no-o-o i reckon not hen

  just come from there i asks

  uh-huh listen hen can you keep a
secret i know danged well that you cant
but i got to talk to somebody me and
susies got it all framed up to get married
but she argues that i got to see zeb susie
aint of age yet and zeb is her guardian
sabe

  believe me henry if i owned a peni-
tentiary id hire zeb id a killed him a
long time ago if it wasnt for susie cause
no sheep-man can tell me where to head in
at-dang his old billy-goat face hes a
darned-

  not to change the subject muley says
i but why dont you ask him

  i did do you think id feel this way
over futures youre dam well right i
asked him know what he said he said
to me just like this mister bowles you
keep away from miss abernathy shes
got her sights set higher than a forty-dollar
puncher

  thats what he said henry and then
i said mister abernathy youre tilting
that gun for her let her do her own shoot-
ing and he said your reputation aint
none too good and if the vigilantes ever
organize here susie would be a widow
you wouldnt know it says i  cause
theyd get you first

  muley says i which one of you shot
first

  neither one i beat him on the draw
but you cant kill your sweethearts guard-
ian it aint ethical hen he told me
that any old time i could show enough
money to buy out his herd i could have
susie i told him i wasnt in the habit of
buying either sheep or wives and he said
he knowed that without me telling him
said that no forty-a-month puncher was
ever that foolish



  how about susie-does she love you
muley

  uh-huh he sighs she sure does i
dont know how she can but she does

  i dont know either muley but it takes
all kinds of folks to make a world

  i been thinking of marriage for a long
time he sighs i been afraid to ask her
but today she up and kissed me and that
settled it hen funny what a little kiss
will do thataway it makes me desperate
it would have done the same to me
muley if a girl like her kissed me id
likely turn outlaw you aim to go to
chicago with that train of cows

  i cant hen i hope the old man dont
ask me to you going

  no telescope and chuck are going
but the old man wants me to act as foreman
while theyre gone-hes going too ill
ask him to let you stay if you want me to
muley

  id love you like a brother hen he
sighs i want to be near her

  thats muley being of a poetical tem-
perament he has to confide in folks if me
or telescope or chuck got kissed by a lady
wed cherish the memory to our graves-
unless it was susie and think of it only
when alone

  i aint so bad to look upon and a lady
couldnt be censured for giving me a kiss
but when it comes to telescope and
chuck-well i suppose theyll eventually
marry beautiful women

  telescope is built like a bed-slat and
orates openly that hes a twig of the
tolliver tree which flourished and bought
colored help in kentucky before the plans
were drawn for the pyramids chuck
warner dont claim nothing and dont get
sore if you subtract from his ancestry he
was bom west of the arizona line and if he
descended from anybody it was ananias

  chucks legs are as short as his memory
and he was born with the face of a horse
and the trusting eyes of an angel he never
told the truth but once a big feller from
down below mesquite took him down and
bumped his head on the ground

  you got enough asks the big person
and chuck howls-

  plenty

  you aint lying are you asks the
feller after he lets chuck up

  chuck brushes off his clothes and shakes
his sore head


adventure

  no dang it all i wasnt in no position
to lie about it

muley told me that i couldnt
keep a secret and i didnt me and
chuck and telescope rides to town
that afternoon to foiler out the usual
program expected of punchers with a
months pay aboard and i tells them
about muleys troubles

  hes more to be censured than pitied
admits chuck i dont blame zeb but
i do hate a shepherd what thinks a puncher
aint good enough for his relatives

  poor muley says telescope sad-like
any man what is just one aunt shy of being
an orphan has my sympathy ill promise
you hen that ill do all i can

  in muleys name i thanks you says i
but if you cant do it for muley dont do
it on my account i aint going to marry
her i just feel sorry for him id feel
sorry for anybody what was in love with
susie

  she aint exactly of the vampire type
agrees chuck muleys got one dead
immortal cinch though nobodys going to
come along and steal her away from him
zeb says hell have to marry her over
his dead body or bring money enough to
buy out his sheep says i

  the latter is the more revolting says
telescope tell muley well fix it for him
after we get back if we have to steal zebs
sheep so he wont have nothing to sell
the next few days were a busy crew
loading twenty cars of beef for chicago
and we dont have much time for con-
versation muley is too fat to herd em
up the chute so he sets down cross-legged
on top of a car and checks off the loads
zeb abernathy comes over to the yards and
sets down on top of the fence along with
a lot of other loafers and when telescope
sees him he crosses the corral and sets down
beside zeb

  howdy zeb says telescope rolling a
smoke you going to leave here after
you sells out or are you going to make your
home with susie and her husband

  hu-u-u-u-h grunts zeb amazed-like
whats that you said

  haw haw haw laughed telescope slap-
ping zeb on the back you cant keep
things like that a secret around here old-
timer whatll we bring to the charivari-
sheep-shears or tin cans

  zeb sets there working his jaws faster
and faster over his tobacco and pretty soon
he looks up at muley muley grins at him
and nods thats the last straw

  muleys going to buy out zeb and marry
his niece states telescope to johnny
myers owner of the triangle brand
muleys going to be a sheep-king johnny
all this time zeb has been getting off the
fence and hes so mad that he dances a jig
in the dust when he hits the ground

  ya-a-a-a-ah he whoops waving his
long arms like a swarm of bees was after
him telescope tolliver youre a liar if
you think it marry that fat forty-dollar
fool buy my herd say he aint never
had money enough to buy a woo sock
ya-a-a-a-ah you think youre funny
dont you

  ya-a-a-ah mimics chuck wiggling his
ears zebbie youre learning now the
chorus-ba-a-a-a-a-ah  

  zebs feelings cant stand no more so
he turns around like a man with a sore
throat and goes back toward town stiff-
legged like a bear with a peeve on

  zeb loves you fellers laughs johnny
i heard him say this morning that theres
just five things he hates one is a rattle-
snake and the other four draws a salary
from whittaker whats he sore at you
fellers for has the sheep affected his
brain

  such a theory is absurd jolmny says
i it cant be proved cause nobody with
brains ever mixes up with sheep you
cant corrupt a coyote

  a little later on me and muley are setting
on the fence when telescope climbs up
beside us and talks to muley like a father

you realize what this here marriage
stuff means muley he asks you sure
you aint just sick like a calf for its maw
i know my own heart liver and lights
telescope replies muley

  really love her with all your heart and
soul eh say ill bet youd turn her down
cold if it was to your advantage

  you dang well know i wouldnt
suppose says telescope suppose
somebody said to you muley ill give you
a years salary if youll keep away from
susie what would you do

  me id rise up on my hind legs
and inform him that my love aint
for sale sabe not for the salary of a
lifetime
making good for muley



   telescope thinks it over for a while and
then shakes his head sad-like

 maybe you would muley i sure
hopes you gets them sheep cause you
qualifies for the shepherd class without no
fixing ive read about love making a fool
out of a man but-well it aint no funeral
of mine

  that night we shakes hands with tele-
scope and chuck and the old man and
wishes them many happy returns of the
day

   dont give up the ship muley advises
telescope do a lot of thinking while
were gone and if you can figure out any
way of making money without robbing a
bank me and chuck will put her over for
you eh chuck

   a stiff upper lip gathers no mustache
proclaims chuck and a faint heart never
rustled no sheep muley so-long you
pitch-fork puncher and ilen-ree dont
fall in love one shepherd in the family is a
plenty

  me and muley rides back to the ranch
but muley aint got much to say love
is a queer little animal and affects folks
different muleys was the dark-blue vari-
ety with circles around the eyes

   the next morning after breakfast muley
gets a sheet of paper and a pencil and seems
to compose deep-like after a while he cuts
loose a deep sigh and looks dreamy-like
at the ceiling

   im here says i can i help you in
any way muley

  ive got it he sighs you cant
appreciate it cause you aint got no finer
feelings but ill recite it to you

        i loved a darling angel

           and she loved me quite a lot

         her ears are like the clam shell

           and i can forget her not

       shes doomed to marry money

           and my heart will break i think

         if i dont wed this angel

           i will drown myself in drink

  nice sentiment i applauded bob-
by burns never had nothing on you except
the long sound of his rs but youll have
to put off your demise for at least another
month you cant do an artistic job of
drownding in a couple of dollars worth
of hooch if you was to get in over your
depth in liquor muley what brand would
you prefer

  right then muley gets sore at me i

finds that you can josh a man about love
just so far and then he turns like a worm
and tries to bite me

      for the next few days he writes
rfraj poetry in the evening and is absent
most all day he aint a pleasant
critter to talk to so i spends most of my
time playing solitaire one day down in
paradise i runs across susie

  seen muley lately i asks and she
shakes her head

  no uncle zeb ordered him off the
ranch and since then ive only seen him
at a distance he-he said he was going
to try and convince uncle that hes some-
thing more than an ordinary cowboy do
you think he can mister peck

  not unless uncle loses his sense of sight
muley is pining away day by day and
unless something comes up to relieve the
situation hell be able to go through a door
without turning the knob i know this
is a leading question miss abernathy but
would you marry that lemuel bowles if you
had a good chance

  why-er-uh-huh says she nodding
her head brave-like while her ears get hot
enough to light a cigaret on

  i feel sorry for muley says i letting
her take it any way she wants to and then
i lopes away cause i sees zeb coming

  the next morning we aint no more than
out of bed when in rides old paddy morse
paddy runs the post-office along with his
little store and this is the first time i ever
seen him at the cross j

  is le-mule allender bowles to home
he inquires peering over his specs at me

  right here paddy says muley
what do you want

  letter for you reckon its for you
cause there aint no other bowles around
this here neck of the woods you got to
sign your full name same as on that letter
or i cant let you have it sabe

  this here is a special delivery letter-
darn such things uncle sam forces me
to ride plumb up here to deliver this or take
the consequences which i believe is three
hundred days in jail or a year-sign right
on that line now i reckon ill go on back
hope it aint bad news muley mostly
always a letter of that kind or a telegram
means death come from milwaukee
you got any kin in milwaukee

  but muley has gone back into the house


adventure

and paddy dont get the information he
seeks

  about fifteen minutes later muley comes
down to the bunk-house where im putting
some rosettes on a new bridle and hes got a
grin plumb across his fat face i glances at
him and goes on working

  henry says he after a little while
would you like to have a job herding my
sheep

  your sheep sure ill herd all you got
in my sleep

  im going to be the richest man in yaller
rock county he proclaims

  you better talk lower muley i ad-
vises if the county commissioners hear
you talk thataway theyll way-bill you to
the loco-lodge at warm springs

  you remember me telling you about
my aunt agnes hen she died

  and left you a sheep i asks

  sheep-always sheep take a look at
this

  he hands me a letter-the one what
paddy brought him and i looks her over
the brand opines it to be from milwaukee
and the top of the letter proclaims that
frederick  quincy are lawyers she listens
something like this

dear sir

   it grieves us to inform you that your aunt miss
agnes auender of this city died on the fifth day
df august 

  according to her last will and testament you
which she designates as her favorite nephew will
inherit the bulk of her estate which is valued at
about one hundred thousand dollars

  as you likely know she was a very eccentric
person and her will imposes you as follows without
receiving a cent of said inheritance you must before
the fifteenth day of august  have invested
four-fifths of said hundred thousand dollars in
sheep

  she also designates that the said lemuel
ajlender bowles must not marry for the space of
five years under penalty of forfeiture of entire
inheritance also that he take a care for alfred
and amelia for the rest of their natural lives all
of the foregoing requests must be complied with
or my estate is to be divided between charitable
institutions aforementioned in my will

   on the fifteenth day of august  our repre-
sentative will call on you and examine your invest-
ments we wish you luck

  i hands it back to him and goes on
working

  well says he sort of choking-like
dont i get congratulated

  as soon as i gets time im going to feel
sorry for you muley how in thunder

can you invest eighty thousand dollars
around here when everybody knows you
aint got a cent and everybody hates sheep
you cant get married for five years and
youve got to feed water and groom alfred
and amelia all the rest of their natural lives
wonder what them twin-sounding things
are muley

  muley sets to thinking it over and folding
and unfolding that letter

  since you sympathized with me things
dont look so rosy he admits with a deep
sigh reckon i missed that marrying
part if alfred and amelia got a fair start
they ought to be about due reckon ill
ride down to paradise-dang the luck
ive torn that letter plumb in two

  he puts the two pieces in his vest pocket
and goes off down to the corral

  the longer i thinks things over the
harder it looks for muley muley aint
got the reputation of a saint around here
and cant even lie so folks will believe him
zeb owns all the visible supply of sheep
and muley aint got no time to spare if hes
going to make good

  along about noon muley rides in hes
got a big bundle under one arm and a big
box under the other he deposits his
plunder on the steps and sets down i sets
down beside him to wait until he gets
through sighing when all to once a squeaky
voice yells

  way round em shep whos crazy
i hops plumb off the steps and whirls
with my gun ready muley looks at me
sad-like and sighs again-

  thats alfred henry

  alfred i asks alfred who

  i dont know nobody introduced me
but it dont matter-alfred is a parrot
oh says i whats amelia-a lady
bug

  naw-w-w cat

  squr-r-r-r-reek sheep dip sheep dip
har har liar squr-r-reekl announces
alfred

  hen whats the natural life of a parrot
asks muley without lifting his head

  i dont know why the question
that letter specifies natural lifetime
thats the joker

  did it say that

  sure did wait ill show you he
fumbles around in his pockets for a while
and then looks foolish-like at me the
front half of that letter is gone henry
making good for muley



now where in thunder did i drop that

  he hunts some more but his pockets dont
essay a trace

  har har har way round em shep
shrieks alfred and muley kicks the cage
off the porch

  shut up you cross between a duck
and a phonygraph you aint yelped
nothing but sheep-talk since i got you no
wonder aunt agnes died-she must have
had ticks

  you aint showing proper respect for
the dead muley i reminds him

  is that so he yelps is that so
well dog-gone it hen she didnt show no
respect for the living when she shipped me
these trinkets did she sending a puncher
a sheep-talking buzzard aint showing a
whole lot of respect that cat is so old
ill have to feed it on a bottle and-

  sheep dip screams alfred whos
crazy

  muley throws his coat over the cage
and slams the whole works into the house
he follers it inside and i sets there for a
while thinking things over the slats on
amelias home arfit none too secure so i
loosens one end and as i goes inside the
bunk-house i sees amelia trotting off
toward the barn

  muley comes down after a while and sets
down on the bunk alfred danged near
bit my finger off and amelias made her
getaway hen he announces in a sad
voice amelia was down there on the
corral fence making faces at chucks
coyote pup and she offers fight when i
tries to calm her spirits aunt agnes must
have been a nut over ferocious animals

  nevertheless she was your mothers
sister and left you all her wealth i chides
him

  yah like throwing both ends of a rope
to a drownding man and forgetting to hang
on to the middle cant marry for five-
huh

  he gets up and stomps out of the place
and i opines that muleys inheritance is
beginning to bear down upon his immortal
soul

the next day hank padden who
owns the seven a outfit shows up
and sets down with me in the parlor
muley is washing up and when hank asks
for him he yells that hell be out in a minute

  im going to make muley an offer says

hank to me confident-like i hears that
hes going to get married and i needs a
foreman what is a married man sabe
single men aint got nothing to hold em
down i like muley-dang his fat carcass
-and i rides over here to see him

  uh-huh says i cause there aint
nothing else to say and then hank yells
at muley

  come out here you half-ton puncher

i want to talk to you about-

  sheep dip sheep dip har har har
i know its alfred but if it dont sound
like muley ill eat my quirt same little
wheeze that muley has in his laugh

  hank comes to his feet like a shot and
glares at the half-closed door he puts
on his hat walks straight out of the door
gets on his bronc and fogs away from the
cross j

  i hears a crash in the next room a couple
of shrieks and out comes alfred with most
of his tail feathers missing he sails
around the room a couple of times finally
hits the open door and perches on the hitch-
rack in front of the house

  muley comes out with a shotgun in his
hand and glares around

  natural lifetime muley i informs
him and he tosses the gun on the sofa

  that bird will be the death of me
henry he wails yelping sheep-talk at
hank padden is like lighting a cigaret with
a stick of dynamite what did he want
of me

  he came over to sympathize with you
about your aunt

  oh says muley blank-like looking
out of the window aint this wick
smith coming

  it was wick he ties his bronc and
comes inside to hear him talk youd
think that rheumatism had typhoid-pneu-
monia and bubonic plague beat so far that
you could cure em both with internal
applications of peach pie

  i got to get away from here states
wick after we discusses the weather a
while every season i lives here brings
me that much nearer the grave i want
to take a pardner into my store and while
i aint decided exactly about it i comes
up here to have a talk with muley i needs
new blood in my place and i got to have a
married man which has a little money
sabe	j

  you got any sheep i asks


adventure

  wick sets up straight and glares at me

  sheep im a merchant-not a shep-
herd

  wool is good for rheumatism says i
offhand-like trying to smooth over my
mistake

  if youre looking for a married man with
money you sure got into the wrong pew
mister smith states muley

  zeb told me that you had an aunt-
begins wick wise-like and then

  squr-r-r-r-reekl meo-o-o-o-o-ow yip
yip yip

  first comes amelia shes traveling so
blamed fast that she looks like a string of
about six cats right behind her comes
that coyote pup digging deep into his soul
for joyful sounds and behind him screech-
ing and screaming comes alfred and they
invades the parlor

  wick hops to his feet as they enters and
of course hes the highest point in the room
a cat will always hit for elevation-there-
fore wick got amelia me and muley
sort of draws back to keep the score but
things happens too fast for computation
amelia draws all four feet together in wicks
scalp the same of which makes wick
wrinkle up his face and forget the rheuma-
tism in his legs the bird and the coyote
dont do much except cut circles until wick
starts blind-like to leave there and falls
over a chair

  wick turns over once lands on his hands
and knees and pilgrims out of the door
with the cat prospecting his dandruff
alfred hopping up and down on his back
and the coyote pup hanging on to his coat-
tails and skidding along making little
snappy barks of delight

  they all rolls off the porch where the
three animals tangles up leaving wick
alone he forks his bronc in a hurry and
sets there rubbing the haze out of his eyes

  amelia is setting a new cross-country
record for cats as she hunts for a high spot
and the pup is singing along right behind
her

  alfred walks circles around a post for a
few seconds and then flutters to the top of
the hitch-rack he ruffles up what feathers
hes got left cocks his head on one side and
screeches

  har har har sheep dip whos
crazy

  my gosh explodes wick that cy-
clone hit me so hard that i can see green

eagles and hear em talk and he backs his
bronc away cautious-like and leaves us in
a hurry

  me and muley looks at each other for a
while and then muley yawns

  i must have lost that piece of letter
where zeb could find it well it didnt
say nothing about buying sheep anyway
hen

  lucky it didnt muley if the com-
munity thought you intended to bring
eighty thousand dollars worth of sheep on
to this range youd be the honored guest
at a cravat party your auntie didnt
understand conditions when she wrote that
will muley

  why emphasize when she wrote that
will henry he asks sad-like after
looking at alfred and amelia-well henry
theres a destiny what shapes our ends
next morning at breakfast were inter-
rupted comes a thump of feet outside
the door and a voice yells-

  hello the house

  hello the- says i that sounds

like zeb abernathy muley

  muley steps over and picks up the old
mans shotgun

  let him in henry says he if he
comes on the prod ill scatter his remains
to the four winds

  i opens the door and the old pelican
bows to me like i was the fourth king in the
deck to enter his hand

  howdy henry says he and then he
happens to see muley with the shotgun
i comes in sorrow not in anger he states
my soul is filled with contrition

  as long as shes filled with something
ill save my buckshot opines muley
come on in and rest your ticks zeb
abernathy

  nice weather observes zeb mopping
his face with a red handkerchief may
rain and it may not i kind of look for a
dry spell

  the weather bureau at washington
gets out annual reports which reach us too
late so we thanks you for the information
says muley

  i hope i see you both well opines zeb
your eyesight dont worry me none to
speak about states muley the last
time i meets up with you i made you throw
your gun down the well hows your
sentiments concerning me at present
im filled with meekness and contrition
making good for muley



as i aforementioned le-mule it aches
my heart to know that i provoked you
thataway and i pilgrims over here to make
amends sabe

  why this sudden change of attitude
inquires muley and zeb sort of squirms in
his chair

  she comes to me like a yelp in the
night says he pious-like i gets to think-
ing thusly le-mule allender bowles i
aint treated you right i hops on to you
like a coyote on a carcass and reviles you
abusive-like cause you desires to marry
into my family i lets my interest in susie
blind me to her best interests but now i
sheds the scales off my eyes and comes out
into the sunshine of true understanding
the more i thinks about it le-mule
the worse i feels youth calls to youth
and what is stronger than the call of true
love she aint never yelped at me boys
but im a heap wise while le-mule is
only getting forty a month now i feels
that in the due course of time hell be a
shining light of the community and maybe
go to congress

  good sentiments zeb i agrees but
it will likely be a close race between the
voters and the sheriff to decide whether
he goes to helena or deer lodge

  haw haw haw roars zeb muley
will never go to the penitentiary

  not willingly i agrees what are
your sheep worth today

  i have no sheep henry he grins
sold out to a feller from st maries basin
and his drive started today yep im a
civilian now

  got a good price too he grins when
he sees me look foolish-like at muley
glad i sold too much sentiment against
sheep well boys i reckon ill toddle
along i couldnt sleep until i comes over
and squares myself with le-mule come
over and make yourself to home at my
place le-mule

  thanks zeb-uleon says muley i
may do that little thing zeb-uleon hows
susie zeb-uleon

  tolable le-mule shes pining

  we watches him ride away and then
muley spits reflectively

  henry if that old pelican had called
me le-mule once more id have slaughtered
him he must have found that letter i
lost

  you ought to invest your money in a

detective agency and run it yourself i
suppose youll go over to see susie

  dang well know i will why not

  go ahead go ahead muley and lose
a hundred thousand whats a fortune
beside her your brain aint big enough
muley when it gets over forty dollars
it all looks alike to you you take my
advice and buy sheep

  yah-h-h-h he blats where

  what will you give me if i buy em for
you i asks

 you you got a dead aunt too
henry

  no but i got brains and i can buy

sheep

  go buy em then he snaps im from
missouri-me

muley rides away in the general
direction of his hearts desire and
i gets an inspiration over in st
maries basin is plenty of sheep and i never
saw a sheep-man yet what wouldnt sell out
i like muley dog-gone his irresponsible
heart i like him his mind aint big
enough to contemplate a hundred thousand
dollars and i feels glad for him that hes
got a friend like me to make good for him

  i may be rewarded for my efforts and
maybe not but anyway ive always wanted
to handle big money and show to the world
that henry peck could be more than hes
ever showed

  i saddles up glory and puts a pack on
blazer and leaves a note for muley
telling him that ill be back on the fatal
day to save him from ruin little henry
is going to be a hero and hopes to do his
heroing on a commission basis

  i pilgrims over into a country that cow-
men designates as being a fair example of
the place where sinners will reside in the
hereafter and eats mutton and talks sheep

  believe me i could talk sheep faster than
the men that owned the herds and i con-
fides in em about muleys inheritance of
course i didnt tell it all but anyway i got
options on enough sheep to cause yaller
rock county to build an extra wing on
the insane asylum and said options didnt
cost me a cent

  old testament tilton rides back with
me ive spent about fifteen thousand of
muleys credit with him and being a minis-
ter hes a little suspicious of his fellow-men

  i ride with you for the good of my soul


adventure

orates the old boy when he offers to accom-
pany me

  i reckon that when a shepherd goes into
cow-land its like taking a ship into fresh
water to knock off the barnacles

  hes a queer old coot imagine a man
of his cognomen add the smell of sheep
dress him up around the neck like a
preacher tuck his pants into the top of a
pair of heavy boots and youve got a
portrait of old testament he rides a
little calico bronc with one cropped ear
and a rat-tail and calls it ebenezer the
only way i figure that he could ever hand
out salvation would be by correspondence

  now this here le-mule bowles re-
marks the old boy do you think i could
induce him to come into the vineyard
muley will go into anything thats got
a door on it says i also hell take any-
thing what aint nailed down

   i fear me it will be a task he says sad-
like and then he sort of brightens up
have you ever considered your soul

   i have no soul says i

  say not that you are a lost sheep he
chides me and it makes me sore and i
points off down the valley

  were in cow-land now old-timer so
you lay off on that lost-sheep stuff sabe
down here they calls em plain strays

  we plods down into the sleeping creek
country and stops at hank paddens place
for dinner old testament and hank are
old friends but hank dont more than give
me a nod i reckon he aint forgot what he
thought was muleys voice and he blames
me too when we gets ready to leave
hank acts like i had a contagious disease

  drop in any old time tilton says
hank glad to see you

  me too hank i asks and he gives
me a hard look

   you travels on your own responsibility
he replies

  i wonder what hank is sore at me for
i asks old testament a little later but he
shakes his head and mumbles something
about the flocks on the seven hills and the
wrath to come

  did you tell him that i bought them
sheep i asks and he nods

  yea i did not me henry peck i
know naught of bowles

  i suppose you also told him that i was
going to stock this here range with sheep
didnt you

  i merely told him that i surmised
so

  we rides almost to the crossj when we
overtakes abe evans the depot agent at
paradise

  gosh im glad you caught me pants
abe i never was built to fit a saddle and
this here nag aint no rocking-chair heres
a telegram for lemule bowles charges paid
you sign for it hen and let me go back
home

  we pilgrims on to the ranch but muley
aint there theres a note on the table
which orates that hell be there at three
oclock and its addressed to weinie lopp
of the triangle

  this here telegram ought to be opened
opines old testament who is as nosey as
a pet coon a telegram always means
that something is going to happen and its
better to be prepared

  i tears the cover off and looks her over
it says-

   will arrive your town this date meet me with a
vehicle

  and shes signed frederick  quincy

  i looks at my watch and decides on quick
action

  you set down here and rest your feet
says i to old testament ill hitch up the
buckboard and go to town i just got
enough time to get there

  that was some ride them broncs were
as wild as deer and we went to paradise
so fast that the dust didnt settle for thirty
minutes after i ties up at the station

  the train is late so i goes over to mike
pellys place and washes the sheep-taste
out of my throat it takes quite a lot of
liquid and when i goes back to the station
im sheep-proof

  the train pulls in and i spots my man
theres quite a crowd at the station but
i knowed him the minute he got off and it
takes me about three steps to get where
hes standing being sheep-proof im also
polite so i takes his valise away from him
and starts for the rig

  come on blackstone says i your
carriage waits without

  he starts with me but he seems to com-
plain a heap so i stops and asks him
whyfore the objections

  where the sam hill are you taking my
bag he asks getting red in the face
who told you to take that valise
making good for muley



  mister says i dont excite yourself
thataway im doing all i can to make you
comfortable sabe i advises you to come
along peaceable and anything you may say
will be used against you

  i always thought that lawyers tried to
settle things peaceably but i dont reckon
this one runs true to form cause he hit me
so hard under the chin that he drove my
head right up to the top of my hat that
hat always was too small but after that
wallop i has to stuff the sweat-band with
paper so shell lit

  the train is pulling out when i wakes up
and i sees that fat feller standing on the rear
platform

  what was you aiming to do hen asks
bill mcfee our sheriff who is setting beside
me on the platform

  that was the feller i was here to meet
bill says i hes sure a sudden son-of-a-
gun for a lawyer

  he aint no lawyer henry says bill
hes the railroad paymaster and he
thought you was trying to steal his
roll

  wrong man says i seen any
stranger get off the train

  bill shakes his head so i pilgrims around
to where i tied my rig and there sets tele-
scope chuck and the old man them
three acts like they was tickled stiff and
telescope yelps at me-

  got the telegram did you henry

  i dont have nothing to say and that
seems to make em more joyful i dont
keep silent from choice but that feller darn
near unjointed my jaw and she hurts like
thunder when i opens my face

  muley still wearing crape asks chuck
as we ride out of town and all three of em
busts out laughing

  danged mean trick opines the old
man you remember jimmy frederick
dont you hen he was out here a few
years ago he knows muley well we
were up in his office and telescope and
chuck got him to write that letter

  how many sheep has muley bought on
his nerve asks chuck

  come on through hen did he buy
out zebs herd i hope he aint got mutton
for our supper and then telescope sings
sort of plaintive like

i love a little chicken and i love a little fish

when somebody says ham and eggs i pass along
     my dish

when i get good and hungry i could eat a roarin
   bull

but when they passes mutton meat my stummicks
   full

   and then chuck joins in the chorus

im a tough old rooster and ive eaten snakes
ive spread giant powder on my buckwheat cakes
ive drank rawliide stew till i was out of breath
but when they serves up mutton meat i starves

   to death

   youre a fine bunch of friends i snaps
taking a chance that my jaw is still on its
hinges she was his favorite relative
and since that letter he aint done nothing
but mope youre a danged bunch of
ghoul comedians muleys due to kill
somebody when he finds out about it
what was the main idea

   well laughs telescope we made him
rich for a while didnt we zeb orates
that he wants susie to marry money so
we gave it to him in a lump we puts in
that marriage clause just to see if muley
loved her enough to lose the money sabe
we knowed danged well that he couldnt
buy no sheep what did the parrot have
to say hen

  told hank padden he could use sheep
dip

  haw haw haw whoops chuck did
he honest say that i sat up all one night
and day trying to teach that parrot some
sheep-talk but all it ever did was to bite
me telescope swiped that cat at the
depot in milwaukee

 just before we reaches the ranch
 three people rides in ahead of us
and waits for us to come up its

middle of the room with his eyes rolled
toward the rafters while in front of him

muleys vest is stretched to the bursting
point and you could light a match on
susies freckles

  to one side stands zeb abernathy and
on the other stands weinie lopp all
dressed up in a celluloid collar and no place

  we hears old testament finish up his
prayer and as muley folds susie to his
bosom we troops inside muley sees us
over susies shoulder and breaks the clinch
zeb grins out through his whiskers and
weinie lopp turns up the collar of his coat

  everything is still for a few seconds and
then old testament smiles at me over his
specs

iv kingsbury scott

author of young johnny eisledt

         he call for bottoms on salt water
threatened to sweep the lakes
clear of craft with tons of coal
to be shipped to the upper lakes
and bushels of wheat to be carried from
lake superior whole fleets of new canal-
size steel ships were being fitted for salt-
water service and wooden craft were being
rushed on the stocks to follow them

  everybody had a job or the prospect of
one and hundreds of licensed officers were
taking advantage of the let-down of the bars
in the inspection sendee to post up for the
salt-water examinations masters came
in plenty to brush up on navigation and
engineers added condensing engine knowl-
edge to their fresh-water experience all
tempted by the bonus of the merchant ma-
rine which made them forget the subma-
rines in their dreams of a luxurious time
ashore when a few voyages across the sea
had been finished

  every licensed sailor man in lakeport
seemed fired by the same idea-all except
captain johnny rice

  the fact is johnny rice had not sailed a
boat for five years for the very simple
reason that he had not been offered one to
sail five years before the superintendent
of the superior transit company had told
him that the company had nothing for him
but advised him to wait until something
turned up in the line so for five years
johnny rice had waited

  he had seen the new boats come up from

the ecorse and the wyandotte yards with
youngsters who had wheeled for him on
their bridges but still he waited for some-
thing to turn up each spring he made his
application for a berth to the superintend-
ent until it had become merely a matter
of form to him as well as to the superin-
tendent

  in the meantime johnny rice had to
work at something to keep his board paid at
mother reagans so he took a job as floor
boss in the hudson lines warehouses
where the hours were long and he earned
sixty a month

  johnny knew the reason as well as any
sailor along the water-front and it cut into
his sensitive nature to hear them discussing
him as captain jinx he could not for-
get that he was the man who had rammed
the bow out of the clarion against the
broadway bridge in milwaukee neither
could he escape the recollection that he was
the man who had torn the bottom out of the
hesperia on the north crib at lakeport one
foggy morning

  worst of all he knew he was marked
from one end of the lakes to the other as the
man who had rammed the passenger
steamer corunna in st marys river with
the superior lines big freighter baltic and
sent both ships to the bottom with too many
of their people with them

  the government inspectors had not
exactly blamed him entirely for the acci-
dent they had merely suspended his




adventure

license for the remainder of that season
but the superior line with damage suits to
pay had gone a bit farther they had ap-
peared to have suspended him indefinitely
retaining him in their service from year to
year-without pay

  furthermore he had been black-listed
by every insurance company and every
other line on the lakes in fact bad luck
had seemed to follow him from the very
day he walked out of the inspectors office at
lakeport with his masters license though
he felt that he had earned his title captain
jinx he resented it none-the-less

  its the bad luck thats followin me he
comforted himself and its been bad
luck after me since the day i went aboard a
ship of my own id get away from it if
theyd give me a chance

  the hours were long the pay was small
and the work in the warehouse grated on
the sensitive nerves of captain johnny rice
in the five years which followed the corunna
affair but there seemed no ray of light
shining ahead of him

  then the war came on the sound of the
boiler-makers hammers beat the silence at
deserted wharves and the odor of fresh
paint filled the air smoke curled from the
stacks of the foul-bottomed ships which had
not turned a wheel for years the freights
were up and going higher and there were
not bottoms enough to carry the cargoes
everything which could pass the inspection
was going liack into commission

johnny rice was in the midst of
a cloud of flour dust in the ware-
house one morning when he saw
felton the superintendent of the superior
line dodging between the long line of rum-
bling trucks trying to avoid being run down
by the hunky handlers something told
johnny that the superintendent wanted
him and he started forward through the
dust

  im looking for you johnny an-
nounced the superintendent somethings
turned up at last do you want a boat to
sail

  that i do sir promptly responded the
dusty man whats it to be

  the swain answered felton were
fitting her out and ive got to have her
right away i want a good man to sail
her

  he did not tell johnny rice that he had

been trying to find a man for two days to
sail the philip swain and it would have
made little difference if he had captain
jinx had enough of the warehouse and he
would have taken command of one of the
columbus caravels had it been offered to
him

  the hoodoo eh he remarked with a
grin with me aboard the two of us
between us ought to bust the jinx

  shes been abused thats all said fel-
ton fearing that even johnny rice might
refuse the berth theres nothing wrong
with her and well pay you the steel boat
scale i want to get her out the first of the
week johnny when can you come aboard

  tomorrow morning replied johnny
rice or tonight if you like

  the sooner the better as far as we are
concerned your pay starts today then
declared felton youll have to pick up
your own crew

  that very night captain johnny rice of
the steamer philip swain began picking up
his crew he went first into mother rea-
gans barroom at an hour when he knew
hed find tom carter and willie larson
together and mellow in their cups in fact
he chose the hour that he might find them
not too sober and yet not too drunk he
needed a couple of mates and he knew they
would fill the bill once they were safely
aboard ship and away from mother rea-
gans forty rod

  it required all of the diplomacy at his
command which he finally cinched at the
proper time with an appeal to their pa-
triotism to do their part in the countrys
work to secure their promise but as it
happened they were just ripe for an appeal
to do their bit for their uncle sam in the
merchant marine of the great lakes

  they insisted strongly at first that he
bring the old shoe up to mother reagans
they they might have a good look over her
but once they agreed to be with him cap-
tain johnny knew the deal was closed
tom carter and willie larson never broke
their word with him

  he had a harder task with old harvey
goulder who had quit drinking too late to
save him from the fate of pulling the
throttle on a fish tug but johnny rice
knew and every other marine man knew
that old harvey goulder with his big ton-
nage papers was a wizard of a chief en-
gineer he knew also that old harvey was
captain jinx



not getting on very well with the salary his
fish-tug job paid and that the scale on a
steel boat was likely to look pretty good to
the old scotsman and to the old lady in the
house which was falling to pieces around
them

  what boat is it asked old harvey
suspiciously sitting on the edge of his chair
in the sitting-room with cracked paper on
the walls

  the philip swain admitted johnny
rice with a gulp in his throat

  that old corpse exclaimed the old
man so theyve dug her up out o the
grave too eh shes not turned a wheel
for years

  but shes a big ship and well built
harvey ventured the skipper shes
never been given half a show

  with a machine that was a wreck when
it was built commented goulder she
went through herself twice the first season
out

  i made a trip to buffalo in her once and
i watched that old engine dance around the
engine-room the whole trip then i went
ashore in buffalo and got drunk and i
wasnt around when she was ready to leave
i thought that drunk had saved my life and
you could have knocked me over when i
heard she got back to chicago without the
machine walkin out of the gangway

  old harvey goulder smoked his pipe vig-
orously and stared at the cracked wall-paper
it would have been hard to follow his
thoughts perhaps but at the end of his
dream he turned his fiery old eyes on johnny
rice and glared at him from under his white-
fringed brows

  you and me are in about the same fix
he remarked slowly we aint been in the
swim much lately have we johnny i
dont see why we shouldnt take a chance on
our old hides and get some of the surplus
the superior lines goin to pull out o the
high freights if the old wagon goes under
with us she goes thats all and we mights
well end up that way as starve to death here
ashore youve got nobody and the old
womand be better off without me

with young hughie mcgregor
his nephew who had just passed his
examination for his seconds papers
as his assistant harvey goulder was
pounding and pulling at the swains run-
ning-gear early the next morning little by

little the crew of the steamer was pieced
together firemen from donovans and
mother reagans with their duffle on their
backs and watchmen and oilers and deck-
hands the flotsam of the human sea came
aboard one by one they were kicked at
and sworn at by big tom carter sick of his
mates job and keeping full of whisky to for-
get his disgrace and fed on the grub thrown
at them by a cook who was hiding away
from the army

  ive a fine crew here mused johnny
rice when he stood on the bridge at last
ready to pull the stand-by whistle
theyre a fine bunch to run this old ark
light to the head of lake superior this time
of the year

  but lord knows im runnin no bigger
chance with them than they are with me
he sighed

  swinging out from the dock with her big
rusty hull high in the water the ungainly
ship caught the current of the stream just
at the wrong moment and swirling around
until her stern line snapped she crashed into
the side of the old schooner sunset across
the channel as she slowly backed away
the rusty steel bow slipped out of a jagged
hole in the wooden side of the sailing craft
gradually the sunset began to settle lower
and lower like an animal which had re-
ceived its death blow until her deck was
awash

  thats the first one exclaimed johnny
if thats the beginning were goin to have
a fine time of it before we get to lake
superior

  down in the engine-room harvey felt the
shock as he jumped to respond to the back-
ing signal

  lord bless us he cried captain
jinx is beginnin early the poor devil
no mans ever been chased as hard by a
hoodoo as him

  when at last the swain steamed out of
the harbor that early fall morning the
superintendent breathed a sigh of relief

  well hes away at last he remarked
grimly to the old port captain who stood
beside him im glad he didnt leave his
mark on anything but the old sunset
funny aint it the luck he has

  the swain always was a bad one to
handle responded the port captain and
with nothing in her shes worse than a big
basket in the wind im not envying him
his run light to lake superior with the


adventure

ore in her coming down she will handle bet-
ter if she dont swamp

  up lake michigan to the straits of mack-
inac steamed the swain with the seas from
the westward rolling her slimy old bottom
up to the sun old harvey goulder down
below watched the big engine dance at a
lively pace and sweated the beer and booze
out of his firemen keeping steam to give her
speed with all of her shortcomings it
must be said that the swain had the legs
with all of its clanging and clattering and
its threats to fall apart her engine could
drive her at a good fifteen-mile clip pro-
viding the boilers could be coaxed into hold-
ing the steam

  through the straits she sped into st
marys river with her luck still holding
good but captain johnny rice faced sus-
pension every minute for exceeding the
speed permitted in the channel by uncle
sam flashing along with her bilge water
shooting far out from her shanky side she
swung the bends in the river like the most
delicate motor-car answering her helm with
a fidelity that was almost uncanny

  she scares me sor commented the
wheelsman up through the swearing-box
to the skipper shes that angelic that i
fear shes figurin on something devilish
later on sure ive wheeled her before
sor and i know that there were times when
id swore on me oath that there was nothing
on the other end of these wheel chains
make the best of her while shes be-
havin murphy cautioned the skipper
remember were gettin to the soo
look out for the locks

  im rememberin sor and im remem-
berin that if there is anything within a
mile of her shell hit it too

  going through the locks the swain did
nothing more serious than scrape the con-
crete walls so viciously that the officers
ashore swore vigorously at he skipper and
threatened to report him for carelessness
in the wheelhouse murphy ground his
teeth and fairly hung to the wheel

  the dirty devil he growled shes
human and downright mean thats what
she is

  below in the engine-room harvey goul-
der stood a watch with his young nephew
standing with his hand on the throttle and
his pipe clenched between his teeth

  ill not be easy until we get her out into
open water again boy was his com-

ment she needs room and speed to be
safe

  a lucky star seemed to be hovering over
the old philip swain as she locked through
the canal and johnny rice rang up the
engine-room as soon as he was clear with
the welcome signal to goulder to give her all
she had once more out past the white
fish point light she foamed with a howling
noreaster blowing behind her the gale
increased and with it the swain added to
her speed with the big seas rolling up and
hissing under her lifting stern

  it was blowing great guns outside of the
point and the swain riding high in the
water pitched heavily into the great hollows
which raced up behind her and overtook her
clouds of black smoke poured from her
funnel and streamed out far ahead of her
spreading like a fan over the huge greenish
combers wrapped in his ulster captain
johnny rice clung to the bridge rail

  good thing shes runnin before it he
told himself standin up out of water
like this the old tub couldnt do much with
a head sea

day and night the gale kept up as
the swain plugged along at her
tremendous clip the skipper with
but a wink of sleep now and then in his
room in the texas had remained almost
continually on the bridge in the engine-
room harvey goulder dozed by bits in his
armchair to start up each time the seas
smashed hard under the stern with a metal-
lic crash as the swain neared keweenaw
point jutting out for miles into lake
superior with its copper-laden rocks the
skipper and his chief met at supper

  are you goin through the canal asked
harvey goulder theres probably a big
sea off the point with this wind

  sea or no sea asserted johnny rice
im going to keep outside if she ships the
seas through the smoke stack theres
nothing coming down the lake against this
weather and theres no danger of fetching up
against- anything when shes got the whole
lake to herself

  im glad to hear it declared goulder
its room and speed she needs to make her
behave id rather take a chance with her
going full speed outside if she does bob like
a cork than to be hittin each side o the
canal goin through theres probably a
hundred boats in mud lake and shed
captain jinx



have a fine time buntin into em all and
smashin their plates for em

  a great idea seemed to form in johnny
rices mind and he smiled for the first time
since he had left the soo

  right you are harvey he cried
right you are by gad

  when the morning came with a streaky
light in the sky the swain was doing some
great performance off the point as the
light broadened captain rice could see the
rocky headland standing out against the
milky spray beating at its base fully
three miles ahead and off his port bow
captain johnny rice was astounded to see
a big steamer wallowing in the seas with-
out comment he focused his glasses upon
her

  she was low in the water evidently
loaded with ore and the seas were foaming
over her decks amidships as the skipper
of the swain studied her through the
glasses he saw four jets of steam rise from
her siren and although the sound of the
whistle was lost in the storm he knew that
she was calling for assistance

  shes in trouble he shouted to carter
the mate who was standing the watch on
the bridge with him and shes in a bad
way there driftin up against that point
see what you make out of it carter

  the mate took the glasses and studied the
stranger carefully

  its one of the bessemer ore fellows
looks like she had no headway at all sir
he announced

  were not any too well off ourselves
said the skipper but if we could get near
enough to do those poor devils any good id
try it i hate to stand by and see them go
under

  youre the skipper sir declared carter
im with you in whatever you do thisold
shoes hard to handle and we stand a chance
o losin her

  it wouldnt be much loss to the com-
pany said the skipper but i dont want
to dump this gang into lake superior
without givin em a chance weve got to
do something quick if we do it at all well
give it a try anyway and if the old tin box
piles up on the rocks itll have to stand
against my soul

  plunging along like a race-horse with the
foam flecking her sides the swain bore
down upon the distressed steamer keeping
to the windward of her to avoid the nar-

rowing space between the disabled craft and
the rocks as the swain approached the
name thomas benton buffalo in round-
ed gold letters stood out visibly on the
stern

  within thirty feet of the bentons stern
johnny rice rang to goulder to check
down the swain was just coming abreast
of the helpless craft when she felt the slack-
ening of speed and almost instantly she
began to perform her helm spun help-
lessly and the rolling combers sent her
swirling down upon the benton with a
crash and a shudder which caused the
skipper and the mate to cling fast to the
bridge rail the two boats came together
broadside in the roaring sea

  down in the engine-room old harvey
goulder picked himself up from the floor
and rubbed a sore elbow

  what the blazes has captain jinx hit
now out here in the middle of lake supe-
rior he shouted angrily

  young mcgregor bounded up the safety
ladder to the main deck as goulder scram-
bled back to the throttle within a few mo-
ments the second engineer came rushing
back with his eyes popping

  were layin up longside a big fellow
thats in a bad way he announced and
theyre heavin a line aboard of her i
heard her skipper yell to johnny that shed
broken her shaft and was driftin on the
rocks

  with his announcement came the clang
of the gong the telegraph indicator spun
around to the signal full speed ahead
harvey gave her all she had and the old
swain creaked and strained under the drag
of the laden craft she had taken in tow
but the straining was short lived sud-
denly the swain seemed to leave the water
in a headlong dash forward and speed ahead
like a hound freed from a leash

  theres one rotten line gone com-
mented goulder if we have the usual
luck itll be in our wheel in a minute

  from the bridge captain johnny rice
saw the line let go and he groaned with
disappointment

  might have known it wouldnt go right
he growled between clenched teeth
tilings never did for me and they never
will i guess rotten old line like every-
thing else on board this outfit well have
to do it all over again

  carter he called out get out every


adventure

heavin line aboard the ship and splice em
all together somehow maybe theyve got
something on the benton thatll hold if we
can get a heavin line aboard

   with the wallowing benton far astern and
still drifting slowly inshore toward the
rocks the philip swain began swinging
around in a wide arc to avoid wracking as
much as possible but as she fell into the
trough of the mountaineous seas the rush-
ing greenish combers threatened to roll her
 clear over

 everything loose swept across her decks
with a roar as she lurched down and then
went racing back as she rolled the other way
the seas struck her steel sides and the spray
broke completely over her in white clouds
leaving her slimy bottom visible clear to the
keel at last in a perfect cataract of foam
she swung her nose into the seas and pitched
violently fore and aft

for more than an hour she bat-
tled on against the wind and the
seas until every window in her pilot-
house was shattered clean from its sash and
mike murphy who was at the helm stood
drenched and shivering at the wheel his
face and hands bleeding from a dozen
cuts

   but the benton was astern again on the
starboard side when the swain began to
repeat her contortions in the trough of the
sea as murphy put her about again and
with the seas behind her once more every
one on board the swain breathed a little
sigh of relief along with a prayer of thanks-
giving perhaps at any rate the swain
picked up her headway rapidly and bore
down again upon the disabled benton

   for once things seemed about to turn out
as captain johnny rice figured they
should fortunately the progress of the
ore-laden benton toward the rocky shore
line had been slow the seas had swept
over her continually but her heavy bulky
hull low in the water resisted the drive
like a water-soaked log

   as she drifted slowly into shallower water
off the point she let go her anchors as a last
hope and the rocky bottom furnished a
catch for them the chains strained and
tugged and clanged with the roll of the
boat but they held though the sweeping
seas threatened constantly to break the grip
of the anchors on the bottom

  with an audacity which astounded him-

self johnny rice drove the swain full speed
into the channel between the benton and
the rocks so close was the speeding ship
to the outlying rocks of the point that the
roar of the breakers sounded in the skippers
ears above the howl of the wind but the
swain drove forward as true as a die to her
helm

  a grim smile of satisfaction spread over
johnny rices face he had solved the
secret of mastery of the hoodoo ship and his
great idea had worked out successfully
under strong headway the swain would
handle with the accuracy of a racing yacht
without it she was as helpless as a craft
without a rudder

  just at the right time carter stationed on
the after cabin sent the thin black heaving
line twisting through space and as it landed
with a thud on the wet deck of the benton
a desperate sailor from that ship sprawled
over it emerging from a sea which buried
him at the same time with the line clasped
firmly in his hands like a madman he
rushed forward with it and with lightning
fingers he made it fast in the bight of the
stout cable which was waiting there the
skipper of the benton appeared to have read
the mind of captain john rice

  several hundred feet of heaving line
spliced together had spun out from the
swain as she passed the benton at express
speed then she slackened up to save the
strain which would come when the heavy
cable came dripping and twisting through
the sea like a long thin snake and when
it was aboard at last and made fast around
the drum of the big windlass in the swains
stern the big siren roared out a triumphant
signal the cable straightened out under
the strain and the screw of the swain
sent the water rumbling away from her
stern

  on board the benton the anchor hoists
rattled and deck engines coughed rapidly
quickly the great folding anchors which had
saved her were torn from their grip on the
rocks below and the deep-laden ship began
to slip forward slowly and uncertainly at
first and then more steadily with increasing
speed her prow swung outward as the
swain pulled her away from the rocks and
destruction as the benton plunged for-
ward under the steady pull a deep blast from
her whistle informed the swain of her safety
in a language stronger than the victorious
shouts of men
the raven mocker



it was a long dreary drag to du-
luth but the gale had blown itself
out when the swain pulled into the
outer harbor with the benton plowing at the
end of a long tow line behind her a tug
came rolling out to relieve her of her burden
and the swain went on alone up the chan-
nel bumping a dock here and there to
maintain her reputation

  captain johnny rice stumbled ashore as
soon as she landed and remained long
enough to wire a report of the affair to
felton then he went back aboard and
rolled into his bunk without removing his
clothes when he awakened twenty hours
later the lake country from buffalo to port

arthur was ablaze with the press yarns of
his performance and carter was nearly
frantic in his effort to keep the marine re-
porters from breaking in upon the skippers
slumbers

  feltons telegram was the first thing to
catch captain johnny rices eye as he
rolled out of his berth and he tore open the
yellow envelope with a quick yank to see if
lie had been relieved of his command for
his foolishness however a sleepy smile
forced itself into his countenance as he
read

comers of the league the approbation of
the silent warriors stole over him like
incense with impressive dignity he pre-
sented the wampum showing one dish and
one spoon signifying all tribes should eat
together in amity with great eloquence he
proclaimed his peoples desire to bur the
hatchet so deep no warrior of either nation
could ever dig it up again

   in concluding he had said

  blood has been spilled and must be
wiped up clean bones have been scattered
and must be collected and buried and
covered with white bark come fearlessly
to the eldest brother of the nation ech-
ota and you will always find the white
benches in place and the great white peace
pipe with its seven stems leaning against
them the white wampum now hangs
between the iroquois and my people the
talk i have given i leave with you to give
to other tribes who shall come to learn
what means the fire i have lighted

  and he received peace belts in return
and set out for home conscious he had
done well and stood high in the esteem
of the fierce northern tribes kinsmen and
ancient enemies of the cherokee

  his exaltation abided with him till he
crossed the potomac now that he was
nearing home and bringing momentous
news to the elders each eager stride should
have added to his climax of joy but as he
pressed on through the blazing glory of
autumnal woods he was dismayed to find
a vague unrest disturbing his mind the
war trail which his eloquence and bearing
had turned into a path of peace began to
oppress him the red blush of the maples
suggested blood he sought to diagnose
this morbid fancy and instantly imagi-
nation began working and hinting at an
unknowable yet impending evil

  such a mental attitude was preposterous

  reason told him-unless it be the malignant
work of a wizard or witch that it might
be the natural reaction from a too long
sustained pitch of thought never entered his
calculations white men as well as red
believed in witches and demons the very
fact such notions could enter his head at
such a time was proof positive some
malicious agency was working against him
but wizards and ghosts usually work
through a human medium and there came
a day when he completely surrendered to
the strange obsession and left the trail
and doubled far back to satisfy himself the
iroquois had not broken the faith by
sending warriors after him

  ordinarily such a fear would be absurd
for the talk given and received at onondaga
was sacred he was as safe among the
five nations as in his own home but
evil spirits work through unsuspected
channels and the instinct to guard against
a stealthy menace was overwhelming a
second incredible situation developed when
he discovered he was confused as to his
exact whereabouts

  such a ridiculous predicament could only
result from the work of the little people
who live in hollow trees and caves and
whose malice is confined to befuddling
tried warriors he found the trail at
sunset and camped for the night still
undecided as to which particular demon
the little folks were allied with as he
brooded over the enigma a star left its
position and streamed away to the horizon
showing it was no star at all but a fire-
panther what it boded he could not
imagine

  early next morning he was afoot the
calm of the never-ending forest pressing
upon him like the walls of a tent the
occasional chatter of a tree-squirrel only
accented the silence once a chipmunk
ran up to him and he saluted it gravely
and accepted it as a sign of good luck
for the chipmunk was friendly to man
he was clawed by a bear in a coun-
cil of the animals because he had dared
to speak a good word for men and his
stripes are a constant reminder of that
loyalty

  far above the forest crown sounded the
faint dugalu dugalu dugalu of the white-
breasted geese migrating south big bear
envied them for their ease and swiftness of
flight and the wide spaces through which
the raven mocker



  they traveled with never a fear of an
ambush

  as he followed his trail of yesterday he
marveled at the careless marks his moc-
casins had left now he was moving like
a shadow and often examined the priming
of his gun the lofty sentiments expressed
at onondaga seemed to be far back in the
past he had his bag of peace talk and
white wampum but they were powerless
to oust the suspicion that some evil was
stalking him once a wolf startled him
by crossing the trail he raised his gun
and all but fired before recognizing the
gray streak he was very glad his eyes
had not completely tricked him for wolves
are the watch-dogs of kanati the lucky
hunter and it spoils a gun to shoot at one

  midday found his superstitious mind
taking a new twist he was loath to
advance although he had not reached the
point where he had quit the trail to double
back the consciousness of danger no
longer emanated from the rear and seem-
ingly there was no logic in his tarrying
he recognized this but decided some sort
of an ambush awaited him down the trail
if he waited a bit the ambush would be
lifted

  so again he camped with only half a
days journey completed and that night
wahuhu the screech owl began talking
and with feminine persistency shouted the
same message over and over without giving
him an opportunity to ask any questions
other night-birds through whom the ghosts
talk joined in and derided him but he could
discover no clue a priest would have
learned the truth from them

  on resuming his journey in the morning
he took a new tack with his mind he
firmly told himself-

  i will think of nothing but my sister
little feather who dances like the sun-
beams and sings like the red bird

  and so long as he crowded his mind with
thoughts of little feather and her winsome
sweetness he was at peace

  but concentration has its limits and he
found himself declaring he was not afraid
of any enemy he could see nor did he
fear death it was the inexplicable that
disturbed him and weakened his blood
he wondered if by chance he had eaten
the flesh of a timid animal while among
the iroquois he knew he would be what
he ate he had seen warriors become slow

  and clumsy because they partook of waka
the cow

all these meditations were ab-
ruptly terminated as through an
opening in the forest the sun cast
a vertical spear of light into the trail and
caused his gaze to become fierce and
objective the dazzling light brought out
in strong relief the signs of a trail entering
the war path from the west the marks
were fresh and it was following the trail
he had made two days back by doubling
toward the north he had unwittingly placed
the tracker before him he quickened his
pace to maintain his advantage

  doubtless it was a shawnee that tribe
being implacable in their hate since the
cherokee drove them north of the ohio
and wrested the kentucky country from
them this evidence of a tangible foe
turned big bear into a man-hunter

  here was the explanation of his un-
willinghess to advance a full days journey
yesterday the fire-pan ther was this
stealthy assassin with his mind satisfied
on these points he shifted his gun to his left
hand and drew his ax he preferred the
ax although it came from the stpre-room
of bridge the trader who had debauched
many young braves of the nation with his
strong rum only one fear now remained
that the newcomer would discover where
he left the trail and understand iris quarry
was behind not before him but the
next bend in the ancient path brought him
in sight of the tracker

  he glided noiselessly forward  his ax
upraised and sharply yelled-

  ku now

  with a snarl the figure straightened and
wheeled and big bear was nonplussed to
recognize a cherokee from the lower
towns who had taken to living at the
white mans fort near the cherokee settle-
ment on big pigeon river

  the whistler exclaimed big bear
his arm falling to his side did you think
you were following a shawnee

  the whistler came toward him saying-
it is yanegwa returned from the great
council fire of the iroquois

  big bear smiled amiably the whistler
was very welcome for his presence proved
the fire-panther was a liar and that
wahuhu had nothing but old womans talk
to tell some evil spirit had sought to


adventure

trap him and had failed yet he could not
resist jibing-

  the whistler has lived with the whites
so long and drank so much of their strong
water his eyes have grown dim or he would
have known a shawnee would not leave a
trail a cow could follow

  the whistler drew back his lips in a little
snarl his eyes glowing he knew his
kinsmen viewed him with contempt because
of his continued association with the
whites but english rum was fiery and
had bought many a better man than he
as he drew very close big bear caught the
taint of his breath and stepped back the
delinquents presence seemed to poison the
cool clean woods

  i knew i was following yanegwas trail
said the whistler advancing

  big bear laughed

  were my people troubled about me
did they send the brave whistler to find
me why was he bending over my tracks
as though following a war trail

  he followed yanegwa to kill him
hissed the whistler striking with his
knife

  although taken completely off his guard
big bears instinct of self-preservation
asserted itself automatically the ax he
was replacing in his belt was jerked upward
a few inches and the knife glanced from the
flat side of the head

  instantly the two clinched clutching
each others right wrists much rum and
soft living however had made the whistler
flabby and as they fell to the ground big
bear secured the advantage even then he
would have spared his assailant thinking
him bereft of his senses but as he loosened
his grip the knife leaped upward at the
cost of a slashed wrist big bear caught it
and violently forced it downward

  coughing hideously and done for the
whistler relaxed in sorrow and disgust
big bear stared at the crumpled figure
far overhead came an eery sound the
note of a raven diving and not at all
resembling the ravens usual cry both
indians recognized it as the voice of
kalanu ahyeliski the raven mocker
that terrible wizard or witch that hovers
over the sick and dying to rob them of life
it usually flies through the heavens in fiery
shape and all other witches and demons
scatter at its approach jealous yet afraid
of it it was no fire-panther that big

bear had seen but the raven mocker
hurrying to be in at a death

  kalanu ahyeliski gasped the whistler
staring wildly up into the forest tops
keep it away

  i have no medicine shivered big bear

  stay with me or the mocker will eat
my heart if you stay it may keep away
if you bury me quick it can not get
me

  i have no medicine repeated big bear
fighting mightily to overcome his impulse
to flee

  you come from a great peace talk that
may be medicine you have floated in the
magic crystal that must be medicine

  i can not help you shuddered big
bear

  for he knew the raven mocker being
invisible even then might be standing at
his side he expected to behold the
whistlers body leap into the air as the
demon seized it

  stay panted the whistler bridge
sent me-to kill you little-

  the death-rattle cut him short

  dazed by the horror of it all big bear
could only remember that the raven
mocker could not violate a grave he
frantically scooped out a hollow in the
forest mold and covered up the dead man
then he ran as though pursued by a legion
of demons not till far into the night did
his mind clear and permit him to think
connectedly the whistlers dying words
had lodged fast in his brain and now de-
manded attention he reviewed them and
found them incredible why should bridge
autocrat though he was seek the life of a
bearer of belts a man he had scarcely seen
yet how could a man in his death throes
and while the raven mocker crouched at
his side speak with a forked tongue

it was early evening when big
bear halted at the big pigeon and
gazed long at the great smoky
range one peak in particular had his
reverence kuwahi the mulberry place
there white bear chief of all the bears
lived near the enchanted lake of atagahi
where wounded bears went to bathe and
be cured of their hurts the cherokee
knew that beyond their physical structure
there was little difference between animals
and men in fact the bear was part human
as shown by his habit of standing erect
the raven mocker



in the old days they had worked and lived
together like the indians the animals
had their tribes and elected chiefs they
had their town houses where they held
councils they shared with man the
same destiny in the twilight land of
usunhiyi

  on the lower slopes a ribbon of red was
crawling upward writhing like a gigantic
snake where the women and children
were burning the dead leaves to get the
nuts underneath big bear had been
homesick for such sights ever since traveling
to the north country no water could
ever taste like the water from the big
pigeon no nights so mellow arid starry
as those over the great smoky and yet
the mumbled words of a would-be assassin
had poisoned big bears home-coming

  the sinister problem was ever worrying
him he had nothing bridge could want
the trader was a friend of officers at the
fort and gambled and drank with them and
loaned them money he had nothing in
common with the cherokee nation his
relations being confined to exchanging
poor guns and strong rum for dressed deer-
skins and other articles of barter

  big bear had seen him many times a
heavily-built man showing the effects of
gross living but he did- not believe
bridge knew him by sight the trader
seldom visited the cherokee towns these
days having reached a plane of affluence
he had a plantation and trading-house near
the fort and transacted his business there
much of his time was spent in carousing
with the officers no it could not be as
the whistler had said the whistler had
lost his reason from fear of the raven
mocker he had spoken crazy words

  determined to accept this conclusion
big bear resumed his journey eager to be
welcomed by little feather as he ran
up the river path he discerned a tall figure
approaching at a swift pace anywhere
between the ohio and savannah he would
have recognized that loping gait and he
joyously called out

  the path-killer i come yanegwa

  the path-killer fairly skimmed over the
trail to embrace him but big bears heart
grew cold with a premonition of disaster as
his sworn friend gripped him by the
shoulders and spoke never a word of wel-
come

  what is it whispered big bear push-

ing his friend back and seeking to read his
face through the gloom

  i prayed the mighty adawehi would tell
you i can not ask me of those you love
and i will answer but it takes the life
out of me choked the path-killer

  little feather muttered big bear
the fingers of death squeezing his heart

  the path-killer took his arm and swung
him about and pointed to the west where
a faint touch of pink was left behind by
the sun

  she is there he whispered

  she has gone to usunhiyi moaned
big bear

  to usunhiyi-where-it-is-ever-grow-
ing-dark-the twilight land

  when did she die

  seven nights ago little feather
little feather and with a groan of
anguish the path-killer stretched out his
arms to the spirit land where go the dead

  she was well when i went away what
sickness came to our people

  the path-killer became a warrior burn-
ing for vengeance as he harshly replied
she fell or jumped off the high ledge
near the fort while escaping from bridge
the trader he stole her and took her to
his house but she escaped he and his men
gave chase

  bridge-sent me-to kill you lit-
tle-

  big bear now understood the whistlers
dying words

  he held up his ax and kissed the blade
and in a calm voice asked-

  who were with bridge

  two officers and two of his workmen
i have killed the workmen the others
are hard to get at

  may the raven mocker be near when
they die which must be very soon prayed
big bear over the ax

  i have stalked them close but they
either stay at the fort or shut themselves
up at the plantation sighed the path-
killer they know something is on their
trail they dare not go about the
council would send a force against them
but i made the chiefs wait till you could
come

  it is not work for any but yanegwa
her brother and the man whose wife she
was to be there shall never be while
wampum between me and the white

settlers
adventure

the trader always had considered
indians as inferior animals to be
exploited for gain or exterminated
if they got in the way that they ex-
perienced the gamut of human emotions
never entered his head little feather
an uncommonly attractive indian girl had
appealed to his brutal fancy the moment
his bloodshot gaze beheld her she had
repulsed his brusk advances but posses-
sion had simply meant the taking so he
called in two of his officer cronies to par-
ticipate in the lark and gave orders to his
henchmen that the wench should spoil
his sport by escaping and falling or jumping
to her death was a fault he should always
hold against the whole cherokee nation
he declared as much over his glass as he sat
with his friends and discussed the tragedy

  the finding of one of his employees dead
the day following the girls death turned
him into a fiend and he swore in horrible
oaths the punishment he would mete out
the discovery of the second dead body ten
hours later suggested that some one had
started a system of accumulative revenge
and weakened his ferocity he was not
accustomed to meet those who struck back

  he drank much raw rum in brooding
over the second death and had worked
himself into a mental state bordering on
a panic when his two friends rode over
from the fort to take action on the double
killing they were for calling out the
soldiers and raiding the town but bridge
dissented

  that would start another war and stop
my profits he moodily grunted keep
quiet ill see some of the headmen and
fix it up itll cost a pretty bale of cloth
but better that than to stir up the whole
nation

  perhaps theyve let enough blood to
square it hopefully suggested finsin a rat-
eyed heir of a wealthy planter

  two dead men ought to be enough for
any injun woman on the continent
growled bursen whose impudence and
daring supplied the place of a rich father
curse them for a devilish breed if the
government would pay a decent price for
their hair wed clean them up inside a year
massachusetts has been paying a hundred
pounds for a scalp godfrey what pick-
ings put that price on down here bridge
and ill have pounds to your shillings and
pay what i owe you to boot

  bridge studied his glass morosely as he
said

  wish it could be settled without a fuss
got to have injuns to make profits youd
better quarter a score of your soldiers over
here my men are getting silly-some of
them got injun women who fill them up

with their-ghost yarns

  ill detail some men for outpost duty
here readily agreed bursen then rais-
ing his glass he mockingly cried speaking
of ghosts heres to the hussy that was
fool enough to prefer the river to your
caresses

  dont shouted the trader that is
im unstrung

  i should say you are jeered finsin
eying him in surprise whats a dead
injun

  bridge rose and examined the fastenings
of the heavily-barred shutters he was
conscious of his companions curious
scrutiny as he returned to the table and
fell into his chair

  im shut up here alone except when you
chaps call he muttered gits on my
nerves-that and the rum cant help
hearing the injun womens talk-creepy
as to what urged bursen winking at
his companion

  bridge started to pour out a drink paused
and spilled the liquor on the table and
raised a hand for attention it was a
weird night sound

  owl mumbled finsin think it was
a war-whoop

  the wench come back to haunt you
maliciously suggested bursen

  neither ghosts nor war-whoops can
make my hand shake like that hoarsely
assured bridge holding up his heavy hand
and studying the twitching fingers

whatn - do you suppose causes

that i aint drunk ever hear them
injun yams about the raven mocker
bursen laughed loudly and demanded-
who hasnt

  he affected to speak in huge disgust
yet his glance traveled toward the window

  they have a pleasant trick of eating
the heart of the dying medicine-men coil
the great invisible serpent round the
house to keep them out even that isnt
a sure remedy

  get two serpents advised finsin with
a maudlin grin

  some things about their medicine we
the raven mocker



whites dont understand grunted bridge

  some things about their raven mocker
their priests dont understand added
bursen in coiling the serpent the priest
must leave an opening between the head
and tail where you can go in and out
otherwise the medicine isnt any good
and theres nothing to stop the raven
mocker from entering through the gap
ive listened to that rot ever since i came
to the colonies

im in no mood to talk about it
mumbled bridge lets have the cards
i thank you but no refused bursen
rising and bowing with exaggerated polite-
ness your amiable mood worthy friend

would give you -able luck and i

cant afford to lose any more just at present
wish theyd offer a decent scalp bounty
so us poor devils could get in funds im
for the fort coming finsin

  finsin looked longingly at the bottle
bridge urged him to stay all night but
not relishing to return alone in the morning
he muttered an oath and staggered to his
feet bridge hurriedly gulped down a
lrink and swore he would accompany them
and look for a game at the fort but a
recurrence of the night-cry suddenly damp-
ened his enthusiasm and he gruffly bade
them good night from the table

  after they had gone he felt uneasy and
even imagined something was watching
him through the oak shutters he knew
such spying was impossible but the notion
persisted till he rang for his superintend-
ent to keep him company the super-
intendent eagerly assailed the bottle con-
tent to sit in silence while his master
brooded over the stubbornness of the in-
dian character

  why the devil dont you say some-
thing he finally roared wheres the
whistler

  dead was the laconic reply

  dead faintly screamed bridge bounc-
ing to his feet

   lor sir i didnt low youd be inter-
ested hes only a injun meekly replied
the superintendent found dead on the
big war trail been buried but some wild
things had dug him out

  bridge sank limply into his chair and
endeavored to make his voice sound
natural as he said-

  probly a shawnee raiding band caught
him

  the superintendent shook his head em-
phatically saying

  he had his hair no shawnee would a
left that seems to have been killed by
his own knife jest like he done for hisself
mebbe he did

  he didnt bury himself whispered
bridge wiping the water from his forehead
what do the cherokee think

  the superintendent shifted uneasily
then retorted

  theys a crazy lot wouldnt send a
party out to scout around-seem to think
the witches done it killed him and buried
him so the raven mocker couldnt git him
they believe all the witches and devils are
scared of the raven mocker and hate it so
theyll bury a man jest out of spite now

i low-

  shut up that cursed babbling cried
bridge thumping the table has yan-
egwa got back yet

  not yet sir hes overdue too the
path-killer went to meet him fath-
killer was sweet-erhum

  go on

  well he was sweet on yanegwas
sister this very apologetically

  huh exclaimed bridge his eyes glis-
tening leaning over the table he hissed
fifty pounds for the path-killers head
but it must be done quickly

  moneys good as earned if he ever shows
up eagerly assured the superintendent
ill look for him in the morning hark
some ones coming and he rose and
stepped to the window and threw open
the shutter before bridge could stop him

  several of the servants were huddled in
front of the house holding pine-knot
torches down the trail beyond the cleared
ground a voice was softly chanting the
night the dancing shadows cast by the
torches the fear in his own mind caused
the trader to shiver as though cold yet
he could not summon the will power to
order the shutter closed he had to stand
there and glare out into the darkness and
witness what was to happen the chanting
was scarcely audible no words being dis-
tinguishable low and monotonous it kept
on drawing nearer and nearer then two
vague shapes broke through the darkness
and into the rim of the torch zone and came
ambling up the driveway

  with a shrill laugh of relief the super-
intendent informed them


adventure

  the officers sir merry from drink i
could tell their hosses anywhere theyve
come back to make a night of it theyve
stopped singing

  the horses made for the lights and the
familiar doorway the men below began
exclaiming in horror and amazement as
the torches revealed dead men lurching
across the withers of their mounts as
they lifted them to the ground and straight-
ened them out under the window bridge
gave a low cry of abject terror

  the superintendent feebly cried

  dead and not scalped-waistcoats cut
to ribbons oh lor no witches was
round to bury em in time

a delegation of chiefs from
the cherokee town visited the fort
and petitioned that a band of
soldiers be sent with their young men after
the marauding shawnee to punish them
for slaying the whistler and the two
officers the commander assented and
dispatched a body of scouts to cooperate
with the warriors but bridge was con-
fident no shawnee would be overtaken on
the great war trail

  so he remained closely guarded in his
house fear and rum his hourly companions
his superintendent obtained a small num-
ber of soldiers to reinforce the plantation
guards and these made merry in the cook-
house or boisterously patrolled the grounds
at night the trader sat at the table
sometimes dozing off more often awake
and clutching the bottle and a pistol and
quaking at every sound the days passed
and nothing happened inquiries made
through the indian women frequenting
the plantation elicited no news of yanegwa
or the path-killer their tribesmen be-
lieved both had been killed said the women

  the superintendent accepted this theory
the two had been slain by the same warrior
or band that killed the whistler and the
officers the shawnee had hoped to escape
suspicion by refraining from scalping their
victims probably there were but very
few in the shawnee band and they hoped
to hide in the cane and hills and pick off
a victim now and then two mohawk
braves once remained hidden near one of the
lower towns for a space of four moons and
stealthily killed till the nation believed it
to be the work of witches

  satisfied the path-killer was dead the

superintendent quietly murdered an indian
represented it was little feathers lover
and collected his fifty pounds never had
the trader paid out money so willingly
he was convinced big bear was dead and
the passing of the path-killer to the
twilight land rolled a mighty load from
his heart with brutal jocosity he re-
marked after paying over the blood-price-

  the three of them can talk things over

  no doubt but what big bears dead
murmured the superintendent

  the traders eyes took alarm and he
said-

  if he aint ill give a hundred pounds for
his head

  ill fetch in the heads of the whole
nation at that rate cried the super-
intendent

hidden in a small cave near some
falls on the big pigeon where the
voice of the thunderers spoke to
them day and night in wise council big
bear and his friend essayed to devise a plan
whereby they could come upon the trader
when he was alone night after night they
reconnoitered the house seeking an en-
trance to avoid the drunken soldiers
was childs play but to gain admission to
the traders living-quarters without a great
display of force seemed to be impossible

  there were times when they could have
slain at a distance providing their medicine
was strong these opportunities came
each day when the trader stepped to the
front door and whistled for his favorite
horse the intelligent animal was allowed
to run free his masters signal always
bringing him to the house on the gallop
it was the one trait in the traders brutal
make-up that savored of humanism he
loved the horse

  these were the only occasions when he
showed himself and never then except as
he was surrounded by his men and the
soldiers a long shot might bring him
down but such an anonymous killing would
not satisfy the cherokee both had sworn
on big bears ax that the trader should
know his slayer and the cause of his death

  it is talked in the village that he is
killing himself with fear said the path-
killer

  fear is good but he must not die alone
replied big bear i would not have him
die by his own hand little feathers
the raven mocker



death was dean his must be bloody
when he leaves the house we will follow
and catch him unguarded consoled the
path-killer

  but he never leaves his house each
day i fear to hear he has killed himself or
died quietly in bed

  he must leave some day he will grow
weary of being alone and will start for the
fort he will whistle to his horse and
mount it and dart away with his men
behind him some day he will come to
the door dressed for the trail we must
always be ready to follow

  my brother speaks medicine words
softly exulted big bear he will watch
the house tonight alone while i find the
horse and make friends with him
adawehi helps us cried the path-
killer his gaze lighting with inspiration
may your medicine be mighty enough to
call the horse to us when his master would
ride him to the fort

  big bear shook his head saying

  the priests might do it the old
people could do it but not yanegwa he
who can drive the raven mocker away
could do it but yanegwa is only a warrior
yanegwas medicine is strong enough
to drive the trader from his house the
path-killer insisted one of the corn
women told me last night he is afraid of
the mocker he does not believe it was a
shawnee who killed the officers he be-
lieves it was a mocker all his men know
his fears

  he hired the whistler to kill me
murmured big bear his eyes blank as he
groped for the big idea it was the
whistler who taught him to call his horse
by whistling he fears the raven mocker
kul i know it now our medicine shall
drive him into the open i yanegwa
who carried the bundle of peace talk to the
five nations say it

strange talk was whispered
about the plantation much of
which seeped into the masters
apartment and set him to shivering it
was said many raven mockers were hover-
ing round the place their cries could be
heard each night some life must soon go
out to attract such numbers of the wizards
lesser witches and devils in the shape of
black clouds had been seen retreating over
the great smoky mountains frightened

from their mediocre mischief by the
mockers

  such-rot mumbled bridge after

pumping his superintendent about the cook-
house gossip keep them women off the
plantation whats the matter with you
you look silly round the gills

   its their ghost yams sir its all ive
heard for a week

   the path-killers spirit after you eh
and the trader grinned wolfishly in thinking
he had a companion in fear what do
those women say about the priests keeping
the raven mockers away not that
theres anything in it yet we dont
understand just what the priests can do
they coil a big serpent about a house
but have to leave an opening between the

head and tail-

  shut up bursen was talking that
guff-the night he was done for curse
this country and its silly tales get things
ready for me to go to the fort

  hoke can run things while were gone
eagerly suggested the superintendent who
believed a trip to the fort might ease his
thoughts of the indian he had murdered

  while were gone scoffed the trader
who the devil are you anyway drink-
ing out the same bottle dont make us
equals my man youll stick here

  after the superintendent sullenly tcok
his departure the trader outlined his plans
he would hire a new superintendent and
then go north and keep clear of the witch-
ridden country he regretted he had not
gone to the fort before cautiously un-
fastening the shutters he peered out at the
west and whispered

  usunhiyi where-it-is-always-grow-
ing-dark-i didnt send the little fool there
besides we were all drunk

  that night employees soldiers and
hangers-on heard a raven mocker over the
house not one voice but many there
was no sleep in the helps quarters there
was no sleep in the masters apartment
the weird cries circled the plantation
now sounding in the depths of the forest
now calling from the tilled fields and out-
houses and toward morning it rang with
ear-splitting violence close to the shuttered
window and brought the trader to his feet
the dew of death on his flabby face sun-
rise found him fully dressed but helpless
from liquor

   he came to his senses late in the afternoon


adventure

and remembered the experiences of the
night he could not pass through such
another night shaking and trembling he
dragged himself from bed and rang for the
superintendent

  im leaving for the fort as soon as i can
get my papers in order have the soldiers
ready and six of my best woodsmen
shall the men catch your hoss
theyd have a fine run for it ill call
the horse when im ready git out

  the twilight land had reluctantly sur-
rendered its last bit of gold and the steel-
blue of the mountains had changed to sullen
gray before the trader finished arranging
his papers bursens i o us went into
the flames as worthless but finsins were
saved on the chance his father might pay
stars gleamed and the dusk was stalking
up from the river when the trader de-
scended to the hall and made sure his guard
was ready and waiting as he opened the
outer door a nerve-racking cry came from
the direction of the cherokee town the
men heard it without their usual ribald jest

  the trader raised a silver whistle and
blew a signal the mocker called again
this time much nearer in a panic lest
the evil voice get between him and the fort
bridge whistled a second time and pro-
longed the call- a crackling of under-
bush and the whinny of his horse answered

and his fear that some harm had befallen
the animal subsided now the horse was
cantering across a field once mounted
with the trail open before him bridge vowed
be would defy the devil himself to overtake
him he snatched up the bridle and saddle
from the horse block and called impatiently
to the horse the animal whinnied and
pranced about but seemed reluctant to
approach

  stand back with those torches you
frighten him bridge yelled to the soldiers
who held lighted pine-knots

  the guard drew off to one side the
horse sprang forward like a bolt what
next happened was never described the
same by any two of the onlookers when
the steed raced up to the block bridge
caught him about the neck and lifted the
bridle then he gave a startled yell and
seemed to vault across the animals withers
back to the woods galloped the horse

  some of the men swore they heard the
trader cry out the name of yanegwa
others were equally positive he shouted
the name of little feather who had died
to escape him only on one point did they
agree that his horse carried him to the
edge of the wood and that inasmuch as
his heart was torn out before they could
gain his side a raven mocker must have
got him

      rivers

 by richard butler glaenzer

from where the mississippis blue to where its delta-brown

i know each bend each levee bluff and bayou up and down

i know the colorado and its canoned rainbow cliffs

and the nile awake or dozing devious as its hieroglyphs

and the somber snaky congo writhing reeking as it crawls

the parana and iguazu up to its double falls

the yang-tse of the gorges and that juggler the hoang-ho

the volga and the murray and the amazon i know

rivers that water and feed the world and yet not one stands out
as grandly as the nameless brook where i caught my first small trout
author of safe and satie

he general in command of that
difficult and important little
wedge which nosed into the
flat ground before the hautebois
woods sat in his headquarters cave im-
mersed in a sea of maps and surrounded
by an alert gathering of staff officers and
telephone operators out of the vaulted
dimness to the right a field-telegraph
clicked incessantly the general stabbed
angrily with his compass point at a spot
colored red on the map before him

  ces sales bodies iht he spat through
his bristly grizzly mustache always
they appear to have knowledge of what we
purpose ss-s-saprist 

  he swung in his chair and turned to a tall
officer who wore the coveted device of the
double wings he addressed him in eng-
lish

  meestaire reynold you will ave ze
goodness yes and send up one of your so
brave boys to make obsairvation wis all
speed

  tout suite tnon general captain
reynolds saluted and strode from the
dug-out

  outside he jumped into one of the swift
autos distinguished by the tiny staff pen-
nant and indicated the hangars half a mile
distant in another minute he was among
his own boys of the escadrille no need
to explain which escadrille there is but one
those hard-flying hard-fighting young ad-

 sense of balance etc

venturers to whom even the french aviators
take off their hats

for extreme accuracy it might be added
that captain reynolds was in command
of flight d which had been specially
detailed to that important section in his
little office partitioned off from the quarters
he consulted a memorandum sheet of daily
operations then he stepped out and
crooked his finger at a lithe brown-faced
young man who jumped to meet him

not exactly your turn mackensie but
i want a good man i wish youd go up
and see if you can find out anything across
the line

second lieutenant mackensie saluted
and ran out to his machine at the door
he halted for a second

observer he asked

no make it a single hop and hurry 

a moment later reynolds followed him
he was already climbing into his machine
while a mechanician spun the great pro-
peller reynolds called to him

wind twenty-seven and strato-cumu-
lus fifty-five hundred

mackensie glanced up at the clouds and
nodded quickly then to the mechan-
ician-

all ready

all ready sir

on

the mechanician heaved down on the
propeller blade and swung sharply clear to


adventure

the right the great fins spun twice with
a heavy blip blip and then swung stiffly
back to the horizontal

  off called mackensie as he pressed
down on the ignition button

  the mechanician cranked the propeller
over for a few turns

  on

  on said the mechanician and heaved
sharply down once more

  this time the engine caught up the
ignition with a roar mackensie wasted
no time in wanning up

  let her go he shouted

  the other mechanicians who were bracing
themselves against the thick entering-edge
of the great planes ducked quickly under
and the machine shot away from them
overcoming its inertia with unbelievable
speed under the tremendous thrust of its
hundred and fifty horse-power engine
almost immediately mackensie pulled back
on the elevating controls and without a
bump the great machine glided into its own
element mackensie drew out the gas
lever to the last notch and pulled the
control almost to his chest the machine
pointed its nose to the sky and whirled the
blue smoke from the exhaust to fan out
against the grass

  whew hell tail-slide if he dont watch
out gasped a mechanician

  but lieutenant mackensie knew his
machine as he knew his own soul in less
than five minutes he disappeared behind a
scurrying woolly cloud five thousand
five hundred feet the altimeter read just
as his commander had said

  one of the flyers lounging at the hangar
door nodded with appreciation

 nice clean climb he remarked
casually

  you said agreed another  s more
than the hun can do as yet-well hope he
gets back

  uh-huh

  and the group turned into the hangar
again the assenting grunt was the only
indication which these quiet men vouch-
safed that their comrade had gone to play
with death on even chances

  mackensie did get back within the
hour he suddenly shot through a white
cloud like a falling meteorite nose-down
he swooped almost vertically never flat-
tening till within a hundred feet of the
ground then he glided into the hori-

zontal and a minute later he skimmed the
grass with a precision which rolled his
machine to the very doors of the hangar
the wings and fuselage were spotted with
neat little round holes almost a hundred
of them mackensie climbed out of his
perch and pushed the goggles up into his
hair

  couldnt get a darn thing he growled
the air is just buzzing with hostiles and
they kept me above the cloud-level all the
time dived into a hole once and got a
glimpse of a million anti-air guns and then
a swarm of them chased me

  he strode into the quarters to make out
his official report

  it was a cryptic document which he
evolved below the entries of air con-
ditions and time of departure and return
came the following riddle

  made enemys lines at six thousand imme-
diately h a appeared under my tail firing
side-looped and got broadside position got in fifty
rounds lewis at a hundred h a went down in
spin i was following when attacked by another

h	a on my tail went off on the wing and
climbed got on his tail got in good burst of a
hundred rounds h a looped reverse two
more h as below me cumbed to fourteen
thousand before got clear

  there was more to the same effect a
whole sheet of technical enigma grimly
redolent of battle and murder and sudden
death interpreted briefly it meant that
he had been attacked by an h a which
meant hostile aeroplane had escaped by
clever maneuvering had attacked in turn
been attacked again had taken his turn
once more till finally ever-increasing num-
bers had driven him off the condition of
his machine showed how fierce had been
the fighting

  captain reynolds skimmed through the
report with a practised eye

  em couldnt get any of them

  no luck at all i dont know about
the first but they were too many for me

  captain reynolds frowned

   s too bad i never saw such a rotten
run of luck as yours well ill report to
the general maybe hell want the whole
darn squadron out though we cant do
much with these clouds so low

  but the general saw reason he realized
the impossibility of getting under the cloud-
level in the face of the enemys flyers to
say nothing of the anti-aircraft guns which
the honor of the escadrille



were dangerous up to ten thousand feet
the attempt had to be postponed then to
wait for more propitious air conditions
the general chafed for the enemy truly
showed a diabolical knowledge of his plans

meanwhile mackensie after
his short hour of duty-which how-
ever involved more nerve-strain
than a whole day in the trenches-was
sprucing up for a holiday he had washed
voluminously shaved carefully and was
now attending with methodical exactness
to the final details of his well-kept nails
one of his reckless fellows on whose hands
time hung heavy pounced on him

  my my look at mac all camouflaged
up like he was going to a wedding where
away mac

  mackensie dodged the issue

  engine throws oil something fierce i
must get my mechanicians after it

  doubtless old acrobat satis doubt il
faut quon jump upon the cochons avec both
feet but that dont say what all the
disguise is for

  well if you must know since ive done
a days job im going out to relax and jeer
at you poor ticks who have to stick around
hear him fellers listen to the leisured
patrician but again i demand where
where dyou find all this amusement in
this so lugubrious vale of tears
mackensie suddenly grinned at him
hospital he said laconically

  there was a shout from the rest

  ha ha wily fellow leave it to a
canny scot all the time which one is it
mac ill bet its that tall blonde

  no it isnt shouted another i know
its miss levasseur macs trying to cut
in on watso here

  the young flyer mentioned flushed
angrily at the suggestion

  mackensie smiled on them easily
wrong again im going on a matter of
business

  the crowd greeted this preposterous
subterfuge with prolonged howls and only
ceased from their exuberant derision when
captain reynolds came in and held his
hands over his ears he took a seat on an
upturned uniform-case and it was evident
that there was something on his mind

  boys he began slowly weve got to
do something

  sure capn lets came unanimously

from the crowd what shall we do
no this is serious boys it concerns
us as a bunch the old general is a white
man from way back and hes not saying
anything but its a fact that hes worried
about the huns getting all the information
they want now its up to us boys i feel
that the honor of the outfit is at stake

  his hearers stirred uneasily at this
imputation slight though its was that they
had fallen short in what was expected of
them

  gee whiz capn i hope the general
dont think that way thats pretty
strong but i dont see how anybody can
blame us ill bet were keeping our air
as clear of observers as theyre keeping
theirs

  the captain gave a quick sop to their
pride

  of course theyve put their best men
against us here i suppose thats a com-
pliment to us but-

  well were holding them even at that
a stocky youth broke in hotly spite of
the fact that theyve got more machines
i should say why that ground is just
sprouting hangars and a a guns theres
five big shacks and two more going up
but at that as billy says we hold them
even every time no sir if theyre getting
information about the generals works its
not from their sky-observations itll be
their intelligence system spy stuff thats
what

  the captain nodded but without en-
thusiasm

  youre right boys i know but its
results that the general looks at weve just
got to do something to put a crimp in their
gang weve got the reputation of all
uncle sams flyers to keep up and by
cripes were not going to fall down on it
right capnl we will

  these men were not given to wild bursts
of cheering or spasms of spectacular emo-
tion-a matter which always amazed their
french confreres they had no emotions
as a matter of fact and all their nervous
reactions were strictly under control but
each man felt a glow of hard determination
at their captains quiet confidence

  well im going to see if we can get any
photos tomorrow the captain resumed
ill have decker go up with some of you
hes got all his apparatus ready ill slate
you for first hop in the morning watson


adventure

  watson looked up with a sudden frown
and he shifted uneasily on his seat pres-
ently he made bold to speak his words
were nervously formal

  if you dont mind sir id rather take
up somebody else

  the captain was surprised

  frankly sir i-i dont like heinie
decker he laid emphasis on the name
nothing against him personally sir noth-
ing at all but-well its his name and-
he was bom on this side too i suppose
its prejudice but if its all the same to you
id rather take up somebody else anybody
else

  a series of nods and a grunt or two
signified that others of the men felt the
same way

  ah whats the matter with heinie
broke in mackensie hes the best pho-
tographer in the outfit

  maybe but aerial photography is no
longer a matter of the individual observer
its a matter of apparatus and the expert
in the developing-room

  not entirely watso my son by no
means replied mackensie its still
up to the observer to know just when to
pull his exposure lever hes got to judge
the best position and the best light give
heinie to me captain let me have him
for keeps and ill bet we get more valuable
pictures than any of you fellows

  captain reynolds looked relieved

  very well if its so easily settled i
know how some of us feel about the mis-
guided fanaticism of the german-born
mind ill schedule some other man for
you watson and results boys thats
what we want from now on results

  the captains tone indicated that the
serious side of his business was accom-
plished mackensie heaved his lean length
from his seat

  well if thats settled captain ive got
an important business engagement at the
hospital

  once again the howls of derision rose
mackensie turned in the doorway and
smiled slowly on his fellows with impassive
eyes and then he disappeared watson
looked after him sourly

  huh results he muttered his mind
still half-engaged with the captains ex-
hortation if id been out on that last
observation i bet id have got at least one
hun machine

   hark at the boy laughed a man who
 carried the coveted decoration of the legion
 on his chest hed have crashed a hostile
 man lemme tell you that mac there is one
 of the best flyers we have

   well you dont notice that he rates any
 stars do you

   the disgruntled youngster referred to
 the tiny stars which some of the flyers with
 a whimsical recollection of their own wild
 and woolly west painted on their machines
 to correspond to notches on a gun

   luck pure luck boy and you know it
 why even barker piloted a scout for two
 years before he made a kill shake it off
 kid youre just jealous because hes gone
 sparking your girl

   the man of experience smote him on the
 back with fatherly good fellowship but
 watson was very young and it was quite
 true he was jealous he remained gloomily
 morose

 he hung about the quarters with
 restless preoccupation then he went
 out to inspect his machine but
 before he got round even to the rear brace-
 wires he gave it up and drifted back to the
 quarters a worried expression on his smooth
 sensitive face finally he screwed up all
 his courage and went to his commanding
  officer since there was apparently no
 rospect of any serious work that afternoon
 le preambled might not he take a couple of
 lours off

   captain reynolds had to laugh out loud
 at the transparency of the boy

   run along watson run right along
 he said i guess ill know where to find
 you if youre wanted

   the captains guess did not require any
 great perspicacity watson went almost
 at a run straight to the hospital for an
 interminable ten minutes he was unable
 to find his quest and his face flushed
 fiercely as he thought of some cozy hidden
 nook and then all of a sudden he came
 upon her sitting innocently knitting with
 two or three other nurses who were off
 duty

   it was such an agreeable surprise that
 it was quite a disagreeable shock to his
 preconceived suspicion he lost no time
 but with that swift american confidence
 which always bewildered the girl he pro-
 ceeded to cut her out from the bunch and
 segregate her to himself- after the tide
the honor of the escadrille



 of the first voluble fifteen minutes had
 abated somewhat his earlier jealous sus-
 picion found time to insinuate itself once
 more

  you know he said half-apologetically
i thought lieutenant mackensie had come
to call on you

  the girls pretty eyebrows lifted with her
shoulders in a gesture of surprised denial

  on me mais quel blague how you
are fooleesh non he come to see ziz
monsieur dunois zis capitaine of ze
ingenieurs

  engineers then maybe it was busi-
ness well i thought-some of the fellows
said he was coming to see you

  the girl could not resist the instinct of
coquetry particularly since she knew that
she pouted ravishingly she executed the
maneuver now

  vraiment but no he does not interest
me howevaire eef he would wear hees so
beautiful costume national it should be
different ma foi oui ii est ecossais nest-
ce pas

  watson was not deceived for a moment
he laughed

  a kiltie well i dont know i sup-
pose so but his accent if he has any at
all i should say would be more like a
germans

  ye-es well i ave not ze so good
fortune zat he call on me ii est bel homme
ce monsieur mackensie

  she pronounced the name with the broad
french a and the accent on the last
syllable

  yeah he is- watson who had begun
to admit grudgingly his supposed rivals
physical perfections stopped with a sudden
catch of the breath

  something in the girls intonation had
struck a dormant chord in the back of his
brain and waked it to acute perception
he knew instantly that it had been there
all along

  mackensen he burst out loud

  wat you say

  oh er-oh nothing i just had a
funny idea thats all

  he laughed off his little effusion and
proceeded to make love to the girl with the
assiduous speed of the man who knows that
life is short but he was not up to form
he was preoccupied and his mind wandered
presently even the girls charm could not
wholly distract his thoughts from this new

thing which hammered at his brain with
ever-increasing insistence he knew that
he was becoming dull and with rare wisdom
he forged an excuse and took his departure
before he should appear stupid to the girl

  he made speed to get back to the quar-
ters he could hardly contain himself
he pounced on his friend britten a young
daredevil of his own age and drew him
away from the crowd

  jim he burst out did you ever
notice anything about macs accent
no said jim why hold on
though i think i did yes

  well did you ever think of his name
no well pronounce it the french way
and see now just shift the last two letters
a bit and take the accent out of the middle
hows that mackensen von mack-
ensen dyou get it

  the other gasped

  aw rats watso thats a crazy idea
is it though just think look at him
hes got that cold deadly method in every-
thing he does hasnt he and you saw
how he jumped for heinie decker this
morning and- watson spoke with
slow emphasis-they say hes the best
flyer in the outfit but you notice that he
never brings down a hun machine

  britten laughed uneasily

  shucks watso youre letting your
imagination run away with you youre
just jealous because he went after your
girl

  he didnt though maintained watson
with dark insistence and im not having
imaginative brainstorms either you add
it all up and see how it hits you and-
gee whiz i never thought of that where
are the heinies getting all their information
from

  britten laughed again but there was un-
certainty in it this time however he
rejected the monstrous insinuation

  oh come along watso he said
your suspicion is unworthy forget it
maybe it is insisted the other de-
fiantly but im not going to sleep over
it you can bet ill keep my eyes skinned
britten argued with him but feebly and
finally he too agreed that possibly after
all there might be-well it would do no
harm to watch anyhow

  the watching during the next few critical
days revealed nothing the lean in-
scrutable flyer with the doubtful name
io

adventure

and the observer whom he had so eagerly
chosen about whose name there was no
doubt at all made several flights together
and presently the former was going about
the camp cheerfully joshing his fellows and
making invidious comparisons about their
respective photographic observations and
trying to lay bets that he and his team-
mate would continue to surpasss the efforts
of the others some of the foolhardy
betted-and they lost always

  britten called the attention of his sus-
picious friend to the fact but watson
only shook his head with dogged insistence

  shucks whats a few photographs of
unimportant terrain that dont mean
anything even if they are technically
perfect and ill tell you what ill swear
my soul that i heard them talking german
together you just lay low and watch
out

  then the mackensie man was noticed
to be holding long guarded councils with
his friend the upshot of which was that he
shook his head and muttered regretfully-
theyll never give us a chance to do it
in a million years

 on our own hook then growled
decker with sturdy determination in
the air we make the change

  gosh can we

  sure muttered heinie you just
fly her mine is the rest so i tell you

followed more quiet con-
ferences and the next thing the
two had taken a big morane biplane
and while mechanics overhauled the engine
they personally proceeded to connect up
an intricate maze of control-wires and
finally they mounted a stubby black steel
cigar with a small propeller at the front end
on the top of the upper plane watson
just had to go and look into the matter

  whats the stream-like thing on the
roof he asked casually

  mackensie shot a quick glance at him
from under his straight brows

  servo-motor he said shortly works
by wind pressure

  servo what for

  for a sperry gyro-stabilizer

  an automatic stabilizer cripes you
cant fly with them

  cant you mackensie took up his
challenge son its already two years
ago since laurence sperry went up five

thousand feet and then climbed out of his
seat and walked out to the end of his

wing

  yes i know but what i mean is since
every dip and roll is immediately corrected
by the gyroscopic control you cant do any
quick maneuvering

  do tell mackensie was exasperatingly
sarcastic

  but watson was not to be diverted by
any such transparent subterfuge as a forced
quarrel

  whats it for he asked bluntly

  mackensie stood up and looked keenly
at him decker from behind his back
made some quick signals and mouthed
something with silent distinctness mac-
kensie took it all in without shifting his
gaze from watsons face and then he
smiled his thin silent smile

  its for special photographic work
he said evenly and then he added a dis-
arming postscript for details apply to
captain reynolds

  for a moment watson was staggered
and then it occurred to him instantly that
two such clever spies would surely have
found no difficulty in inventing some
plausible story which would gain them
permission to experiment with the new
machine he called them spies openly
in his own mind now and half he was
impelled to go to his superior officer with
his suspicions

  but he had not quite enough evidence
yet he reflected give them a little more
time and they would presently weave a
rope long enough to hang themselves with
he said to himself so he pretended a
casual interest and presently got away to
consult with his friend britten

 mackensie looked after him with
narrowed eyes

  that young fool is going to give us
trouble heinie he muttered

  too slow said heinie phlegmatically
already this afternoon we can do it look
at the clouds

  mackensie nodded the cloud forma-
tion was a low cumulo-nimbus heavy and
dark behind them lay shelter and con-
cealment but the flyers forehead puckered

  its a frightful chance heinie he
murmured soberly their own gunsll
probably drop us long before we can land
in their lines with my precious little
packages
the honor of the escadrille



  neffer maintained heinie stoutly
when we do as i have suggested-

  and thats a frightful chance too my
friend thats going to be an awful stunt
to pull off

  deckers pale eyes gleamed with fanatical
fire

  for the sake of the cause which we do
he growled fiercely i take twice such a
chance

  after the noon hour that same day
watson saw decker carrying out his
intricate camera and attaching it with
long bolts to the side of the fuselage just
below and a little to the rear of the ob-
servers seat he wondered for a moment
whether after all the photographic story
might not be true and then he laughed
at his own simplicity and told himself no
they would never overlook such an obvious
give-away he would just keep watching
he determined and sooner or later some-
thing would fall to his vigilance

  but too slow had been deckers terse
estimate of him he had failed to take into
consideration the swift efficiency with
which these two men did their work it
was not till everything ws ready for the
start that by a sheer stroke of luck he saw
mackensie furtively hand a few packages
up to decker already in the observers
seat neat fat packages of oiled paper about
ten inches long

  suddenly it came to him that it was now
that whatever these two contemplated
was going to be done right away

  maps he gasped to himself docu-
ments

  he rushed across the field toward the
machine shouting and waving his arms
wildly

  spin her over roared mackensie to the
mechanic at the propeller its on

  on shouted the mechanic and spun

  watsons heart came up into his mouth
as the engine took up at the first attempt
but this machine was heavier than the
usual fast scout which mackensie drove
the mechanicians had to hold it for a few
seconds till the engine picked up its full
speed watson came racing clawing along
the tail of the fuselage

  what have you got in those packages
he yelled

  mackensie looked down on him and
grinned with malicious triumph

  ask captain dunois over at the hos-

u

 pital he shouted above the roar of the
 engine let her go there

   the great machine sprang forward and
 skimmed the grass watson was left
 shrieking and running wildly after it

    but only for a second swift presence of
 mind is one of the first requirements of a
 fighting pilot and uncle sams boys have
 always passed through more severe tests
 than any of the allied flyers in another
 second watson was racing for his own fast
 scout which bore the deadly vickers gun
 pointing grimly over its nose

    as mackensie circled to the higher levels
 he saw him climbing in while there was a
 rush of mechanicians to the propeller his
 face grew hard with annoyance

   -young fool hell be shooting at

 us next he growled then with a shrug
 of unconcern well ill hide in the cloud-
 bank and if he can follow me there hell
 be some flyer

   he certainly would flying through the
 clouds is one of the deadliest trials which
  an aviator has to face infinitely worse than
 flying by night but mackensie set his
 planes in a long slant for the dark bank
 just before he cleaved into it he looked
 down away to his left once more watsons
 machine was just rising from the ground
 mackensie smiled his thin smile in an-
 other second he was enveloped in heavy
 swirling vapor which muffled even the roar
 of the engine he brought his machine
 to the horizontal and settled down with
 alert determination to a long drawn-out
 game of moist blind mans buff

   presently decker stood up in the front
 seat and turned round and waved his hands
 in some sort of signal then with cool
 daring he climbed out and stepped on to
 the footway of the lower plane as non-
 chalantly as though he had been going
 about some small job with the machine
 safe and solid in the hangar instead of five
 thousand feet up in the wet clammy air
 he cupped his hands and roared into
 mackensies ear

   just i have thought what if they
 notice the paint is wet

   mackensie thought for a second then
 they wont nobodys likely to stoop
 and look under the plane when were once
 on the ground

   decker nodded

   yeah thats right too well i go
 ahead with the job
adventure

and with no more fuss than that
he proceeded with his usual slow
deliberation to do an unbelievable
thing he dived an arm into the recesses
of the front seat and produced a tangle of
cords and snap-hooks then he made a
sign to mackensie and moved out on the
wing surface careful to rest his weight only
on the longitudinal i beam and clinging
to the brace-wires to keep from being
whirled from his unstable perch by the
hundred-mile wind which tore at his
clothes

  mackensie watched his balance very
carefully and marveled for the thousandth
time at the superhuman sensitiveness of the
little whizzing gyroscope which detected
every shade of divergence from the plane
of flight as he found how it automatically
checked up against the increasing leverage
of deckers weight as he made his way out
on to the wing he pictured it as a live thing
with an alert uncanny intelligence of its
own and he thanked its inventor aloud

  but decker was troubled with no flights
of meditative fancy with unimaginative
stolidity he wound his legs round the
forward center strut and lowered himself
to a sitting posture he unraveled his
tangle of rope which resolved itself into a
crude sort of hammock arrangement with
methodical exactitude he snapped one of
the hooks over the base of the strut then
lying on his stomach and leaning far over
the hurtling abyss he groped with his arm
and presently the other hook snapped com-
fortingly into an eyebolt

  then he straightened himself out again
with slow caution and returned as carefully
as he had come from the wonder cabinet
of the front seat he now lifted of all un-
likely things a couple of pots of paint and
a brush he leaned over to mackensie and
held up the spread fingers of one hand three
times

  fifteen minutes he shouted  s all
i need

  he fought his way out again and lowered
himself as before the pots of paint were
disposed of over the edge of the wing evi-
dently on to hooks below and then with
a cheerful wave of the hand the crazy
fanatic slid over into his swaying straining
net

  mackensie flew on with a tense face
through the clinging mist and began to
wonder he wondered if he would feel a

lurch if his partner in this wild venture
should be shaken out of his awful perch
but no lurch came decker working with
iron nerve and sure swiftness painted out
the target-circles with which the allies
distinguish their machines and painted in
the great black cross of the germans

  there was no hitch no accident every-
thing had been thought out and prepared
in advance in less than the fifteen
minutes which he had demanded his round
face appeared over the edge of the wing
and he wormed his body up after it like a
stocky eel he collected his paraphernalia
and returned as before mackensie
snatched a hand from the steering-wheel
and slapped him on the back decker
grinned back at him and proceeded to
climb over to the other side mackensie
flew like a japanese ladder balancer who
supports a bamboo ladder on his feet while
a slim youth in tights climbs about on it
and does hair-raising stunts

  in fifteen more minutes decker crawled
out from under the other wing he was
grinning all over like a boy who has been
up to mischief but his face grew fierce as
he stooped over mackensie

  goot it is finished he shouted
now it is in your hands the great plan
forwards and goot luck

  mackensie gripped his hand once and
then he drove his machine in a long glide
through the cloud-belt to get his bearings
they were far to the south and well over the
enemys lines mackensie nodded with
satisfaction and climbed again he pro-
posed to travel through the clear upper
strata till he should come again to the
hautebois section

  after hurtling for half an hour through
the emptiness-for there could be no air-
scouting on a day like that-he began to
recognize familiar ground through an occa-
sional break in the billowing blanket below
him then far away above him his sharp
eyes discerned a tiny mosquito of a machine
which immediately dropped down on him
like a stone he grinned with appreciation

  thatll be friend watso he chuckled
and he dived into the cloud again

  ten minutes later his machine came to a
stop behind the neat hangars and the
bristling hedge of anti-aircraft guns which
he had seen so often from above soldiers
in flat peakless caps began to run toward
them mackensie hopped out and went


the honor of the escadrille



to meet them he ignored the soldiers
just as though they were cattle they were
used to this they streamed on past him
before a slender young man who was ob-
viously of another breed mackensie halted
clicked his heels together and saluted
affectedly

  geslatlen sie he addressed him in clean
incisive hanoverian german i am
leutnant von mackensen from the vielle-
gard section i am out of gasoline if i
might beg

  aber naturlich herr leutnant said the
youthful officer without hesitation

  all muffled up as mackensie was in
leather coat and goggles and helmet there
was no discrepancy of uniform for the other
to be suspicious about mackensies heart
which had been pounding against his chest
before the encounter began to return to
the normal and he heard the officer speak
again

  your mechanician will attend to the
matter permit that i escort you  the
quarters and offer you some refreshment

  i thank you no said mackensie
hurriedly i have not the time to spare
already i should be back excellenz reviews
today personally

  but he showed no immediate disposition
to go instead he stood engaging the
young man in conversation while he saw
decker alight and establish friendly rela-
tions with the soldiers decker could do
with refreshment if there was any to be
had he proclaimed thirstily and the
soldiers grinned and winked and led him
into the hangars mackensie conversed
with the young officer he knew from his
accent that he was a berliner and to avoid
any awkward questions about the opera-
tions further down the line he immediately
lied glibly inventing a fascinating story of
having just come back from leave in his
home town of hanover

  the officer was immediately interested
and mackensie wondered wildly what he
could answer to the eager questions about
cafe kropke and weltmans for half an
hour he fenced with him and then seeing
decker in ostentatious evidence beside the
machine he remembered affrightedly the
haste which was incumbent on him with
the deepest reluctance he tore himself from
such pleasant company

  as he climbed into his seat he whispered
to decker-

  plant all the packages

  decker nodded

  camera ready

  sure everything hurry

  parat called mackensie to the german
hangar crews also-losl

  the engine took up deautifully and in
another minute the machine was soaring
over the hangars in a wide circle

     at the same instant aviator
fjjflil watson was pouring his excited
story into captain reynolds ears
a story of rage and indignation and loath-
ing and he clinched his testimony by
asserting almost weeping with the beastli-
ness of it that he had finally seen mac-
kensies machine dive down through the
clouds into the german lines

  captain reynolds was deadly serious
its almost inconceivable what you say
watson he kept repeating with undis-
guised grief but if youre so sure and
since britten bears you out i suppose
i must take the matter to the general right

away - what a beastly mess

better both come with me i think
twenty-five minutes later mackensie was
dropping like a plummet into his own lines
for the first time since anybody had known
him he seemed to have lost some of his
phlegmatic calm he rushed decker to
the laboratory

  develop out quickern all hades while
i hunt up the chief he barked at him
and raced for captain reynolds office

  ten minutes later again he was snatching
a series of three wet prints out of deckers
hands and sprinting for the generals head-
quarters

  when the general heard his name he
looked inquiringly at the three american
officers who in turn looked amazedly at
one another

  quon vadmette immediatement he
ordered sharply

  mackensie stalked in and saluted the
general was brusk

  well sir

i have just obtained some photographs
which may be of immediate importance
first this one from three thousand feet
the general took it his tone was terse
this represents the enemys hangars
i have seen it before it is nothing new
mackensie handed him another

  the same scene sir two minutes later


adventure

  the general looked at it and looked at
it again and the more he looked the
more puzzled he grew two of the hangars
were still in plain view the other three
were obscured in the print by white
smudges smoky-looking smudges with
jagged specks apparently bursting from
them mackensie chose the dramatic mo-
ment for handing in the third

  the same scene again sir five minutes
later on the return circle

  the general gasped where the five
sheds had been was a chaos of twisted steel
and tumbled sticks from which rose thin
wisps of smoke that was all that was
apparent to the naked eye magnification
later would develop details but it was
sufficient the general gasped some more
then with quick french intuition he
realized the awkward situation which this
amazing young mans unexpected entrance
had created he was a man of infinite tact
this was a matter for home settlement
he turned to captain reynolds

  permit me monsieur he said with
formal courtesy in the name of the french
nation to acknowledge yet once again an
unpayable debt to the escadrille ameri-
caine i will request of you details-
later

  the four men walked across the field
to their own hangars slowly nobody
spoke captain reynolds did not know
how to handle the wretched situation
they were half-way across before watson
broke the uncomfortable silence with a
clean manly confession

  i-ive got to apologize to you mac
he said-he had the courage to refrain
from falling into the formal mr mackensie
ive been thinking some mighty mean
things about you

  i know it son said mackensie cheer-
fully captain dunois who helped me
with my bombs learned from miss levas-
seur that youd got on to the name

  the name then it is-well you see
then i thought you were a-i thought you
werent an american

  watson spoke with relief there was some
mitigation for his suspicions

  mackensie took up the inferred question
slowly and rather wistfully

  well now that depends on what you
fellows consider an american you see
my old dad went across before i was born
he quit the old country because he didnt
like the verboten stuff and the class dis-
tinctions and he didnt like to be governed
by the police bureau round the comer he
wanted to have a say in the affairs of his
country of course he got into trouble for
majeslatsbeleidigung tese-majeste you know
so he beat it over to where free speech was
not a crime and presently he switched the
name around a bit and took out his papers

  me i was born in gods country and
raised in it too but i went to college in
hanover and i quit it for the same reasons
as my dad and for a whole lot more and
ive always kinder regarded myself as
an-

 an american by- thats what

you are britten burst out almost as a
challenge

  and the others grunted-

  you bet

  thanks said mackensie quietly it
does me good to hear you fellows say that
well im sorry mac watson apolo-
gized again i feel like a dog

  ah dont worry son i dont blame
you mackensie laughed i know darn
well we were acting suspicious we had
to cause wed never have got permission
to try the stunt- he glanced whimsically
at his superior officer-and so im down
on the captains books for a bawl out
what i dont understand said the
captain quite irrelevantly and ignoring the
last remark entirely is heinie decker
oh heinie chuckled mackensie
heinies a fanatic hes a berserk a mad
mullah he was born in alsace

  they walked on in silence again their
hearts were all a little too full for un-
restrained speech it was watson with his
boyish irrepressibility who broke the tension
again

  we-el he said slowly i guess theres
about thirty cunnin lil stars coming to your
machine mac
 authors of the red witch the pass of blood etc

nd in proof of our loyalty to
his majesty i offer in the name
of the town of kinlochan one
hundred silver pennies to any
citizen who brings in the head of evan the
outlaw the kings justiciar will bear me
witness that i have refuted the lying malice
of those who have accused us of giving aid
and comfort to the pretender robert of
albany and his bloodthirsty accomplice
evan god save his gracious majesty
malcolm king of scotland

  duncan mclvor rigid as a statue in his
polished mail scrutinized the speaker with
shrewd blue eyes

  there is no falsehood in this man
however many traitors there be in the
town he decided and turned his sus-
picious gaze on the crowd that packed the
cathedral square to the very steps where
they were held back by the spears of
mclvors company of men-at-arms with
loud shouting with waving kerchiefs the
townsfolk applauded their old provosts
speech loyal show them the man who
said they were not

  from them the young captains glance
shifted to the balconies of the houses
clustering about three sides of the square
the fourth side of which was formed by
st andrews cathedral a few casements
were shut the rest were streaming with
brightly colored banners and crowded with
the heads of women and children gay
and innocent enough it seemed this sus-

pected city but duncan mclvor had seen
treason and murder let loose in peaceful
cities before and he trusted little to their
outward show

  he remembered the bloody massacre
of  only two years before when this
very evan the outlaw had ridden with two
hundred lances into ardross caught the
regents troops napping and cut them to
pieces in that terrible night every soldier
had been butchered the regent himself
escaping only by the grace of god and a
swift horse and the townsmen of ardross
had unbarred the gates to the murderers

  the applause burst forth again rever-
berating deafeningly from the high walls
of the houses still rigid in his saddle
duncan shifted his eyes from the crowd
to the cathedral portal a tall spare man
in a stained surcoat of soft leather appeared
beside cospatrick the provost and ac-
knowledged the citizens welcome this
was sir hugh kennedy earl of carfrae
the kings justiciar a terrible man was
he feared throughout scotland for his
grim gray sword and his fierce gray eye
his visit usually boded little good to the
city he honored with his presence

  nor was kinlochan the most conscience-
free city in the land either when the old
king died its people had fought hard in
the cause of robert his illegitimate son
and had been turned to loyalty only by
the efforts of ronald cospatrick all that
was forgiven but evan the headless the



bishop
 arthur gilchristbrodeur
adventure

blood-guilty outlaw had not been forgiven
and kinlochans most respectable citizens
were suspected of taking his pay certain
it was that the young bloods had been
known to toast evan openly and goods
pillaged from the veiy outskirts of the
capital had a way of showing up in kin-
lochan the townsfolk smelled blood in
the air wherefore they applauded the
kings justiciar with all their might

  duncans heart swelled with pride in
his stem old leader there he stood facing
hundreds of men who might be thirsting
for his blood yet he appeared among them
unarmed and unarmored fearless as was
his wont his hawks eyes scanning them
the old earl stepped forward smiling lib
tight-lipped smile acknowledging their
boisterous applause and opened his mouth
to speak then before he could utter a
word sir hugh staggered flung out both
arms and dropped dead at the provosts
feet

  horrified the crowd stood stunned and
silent so that duncans cry burst on his
own ears with a shock of terror and well
might he be terrified well might the
people stand rigid with horror for though
not a hand in the crowd had been raised
though no one had stood near enough to
strike at sir hugh the hilt of a dagger
now protruded from the dead mans breast

  instantly duncans eye swept every
window facing on the square if that
dagger had been thrown from the pave-
ment he sitting his horse a spear-length
before the crowd would have seen the
hand that impelled it would have seen
its flash but he had seen nothing the
windows too seemed harmless as before
excepting those that were safely barred by
his own order they were all too far away
for the dagger to have been thrown from
them by any mortal hand

  the people had found their voices now
some fell to their knees calling on the
saints some wailed aloud in terror a
white-haired beggar in the blue gown of
his caste cried out that the devil had done
the deed to bring shame on the good town
of kinlochan with one accord the crowd
seized on his words and howled aloud

   tis the devils work tis the devil has
done it

  jamieson post twenty men at the city
gate let none pass till i give the word
duncan commanded crisply

  jamieson caught the look in mclvors
eye and obeyed at once he was a dour
rangy borderer on a stolen horse though
he had little liking for his young officer
he understood the consequences of dis-
obedience at such a time

  you kilbeggie mclvor ordered take
two-score men and search every house
in the town arrest all who resist or can
not give a good account of themselves
henderson mount a patrol scour the
district and look sharp for signs of evans
men seize all who go armed steenson
ride to the regent with the ill news and ask
for thirty spearmen

  this done mclvor dismounted passed
through the line of men-at-arms strode
up the cathedral steps and touched the
provosts arm

  it grieves me much to do this thing
donald cospatrick he said gravely but
my duty requires me to place you under
arrest now that the earl is dead i am
in authority here if you will go with
my fellows to the keep i will see to my
master

the provost bowed and a squad
of spearmen led him out through
the chancel door and up to the
dark-walled keep that towered grimly above
the close steep-pitched roofs of kinlochan

  duncan gently took the murdered justi-
ciar in his arms and plucked at the hilt of
the dagger with all his strength he could
not stir it

  if i were as credulous as these towns-
folk i might believe it was indeed the devils
work he muttered no man in scotland
could plunge a knife so hard into human
flesh that i could not draw it out it must
have gone through a rib as an old wifes
paddle goes through new butter

  devils work it was you may lay to
that a hearty voice answered his musing
let me get hold of the hilt master cap-
tain i am a cordwainer by trade and my
fingers are strong

  flushing at the implied slur duncan rose
and faced him the speaker was a heavy-
shouldered muscular man of about thirty
with handsome hard features and cold
black eyes that roved about with bold
restlessness

  what is your name and who gave you
leave to pass the guard duncan de-
manded
the devils dagger

  malcolm carmichael citizen of kin-
lochan and of good repute i was admitted
because i brought a message for you by
your leave i will pluck out this knife for
you

  and suiting the action to the word he
seized the hilt with one brawny hand laid
the other against the earls breast and
wrenched out the dagger

  duncan caught up the mans hand took
the weapon from it and examined the palm
and fingers

  those callouses were made by a sword
not by a cordwainers knife he said
sternly

  all free citizens bear arms and have
occasion to use them against the kings
enemies the other replied carelessly

  true duncan admitted then fixing
his keen eyes upon him he asked

  what was the message you spoke of
speak quickly for i have work to do
the provost bade me ask your leave to
take his daughter margaret cospatrick
into my house now that her father is in
prison she is homeless poor lass

  a reasonable request and a kindly one
but as duncan searched the mans face
he felt less and less inclined to grant it
cospatrick was held on suspicion of the
most heinous offense high treason and
murder and therefore by the hard law
of the time his house and goods passed
automatically and at once to the crown
his daughter was homeless in a town
overrun with men-at-arms and probably
infested with dangerous characters yet to
duncans eyes malcolm carmichael did
not look like a safe guardian for the girl
he did not trust the man and he did
trust his own ability to read mens hearts in
their faces

  i will not he answered angrily you
had best go home carmichael and look
well to your actions it is an old saying
that he who plucks the knife out may
plunge it in

  the cordwainer shot a dark look at him
but before either could speak another word
a womans shriek rang above the murmur
of the scattering crowd and the threats
of the soldiers who were clearing the square
carmichael darted past mclvor to the far
end of the platform between the top of the
steps and the cathedral door and dis-
appeared round the corner of the building
following swiftly on his heels duncan saw

a young girl struggling in the grasp of two
spearmen upon one of whom carmichael
was leaping from behind

  reaching out swiftly duncan swept the
cordwainer off his feet and flung him down
then he struck first one and then the other
soldier across the face with his open palm
the men fell back recognized him and
hastened down the steps in alarm

  i ask your pardon duncan addressed
the girl for the incivility of my men
who-

  your men she exclaimed her brown
eyes opening wide with surprised alarm
then it was you that sent my father to
prison

  if you are margaret cospatrick i must
own that i did send your father to prison
he answered with a trace of shame

  as he spoke he surveyed her with as
much admiration as was compatible with
respect she was dressed richly as became
the daughter of a wealthy burgess and one
who held the high office of provost tall
slender and with the most exquisite
features she would have graced the regents
court her cheeks still glowed with the
effort of her struggle and in her disheveled
garments she seemed an offended queen

  you must know that my father is
innocent of this crime she protested i
saw you at your post as i came forth from
the church you must have observed all
that happened and seen that he could not
have dealt the stroke

  duncan flushed he could not remove
his eyes from the angry girl and her very
beauty seemed to argue the truth of her
words

  when the kings justiciar is struck down
within the limits of a town he answered
struggling for composure that town is
held to answer for the deed and its officers
are under arrest until the murderer is found
i hope with all my heart that your father
may clear himself but i would not
willingly bring hardship upon you your
house is now the kings but you have my
consent to occupy it until the regent sends
his deputy to take over the town and
inquire into the murder

  with charming grace but with uncon-
cealed scorn she swept him a low courtesy
and majestically descended the steps
duncan turned to carmichael who stood
regarding him sourly

  henceforth you will take care not to
adventure

lay hands on a soldier of the king he
warned the cordwainer this time i
pardon you for it was done in defense of a
lady the next time it will mean death

  without a word carmichael strode away
down the cathedral steps watching him
duncan saw him follow margaret cos-
patrick and strike up a narrow street
after her suspecting something vaguely
evil in the mans purpose he beckoned the
nearest soldier to him and pointed in the
direction carmichael had taken

  a tall fellow in murray and black has
just gone up that street yonder he said
follow him and report to me where he
goes with whom he speaks and where he
lives

      mcivor established his headquar-
ters in the keep a small but thick-
walled and easily defended castle
that had once been the lonely stronghold
of the cattle-lifting robber lords of kin-
lochan the last of whom had died with a
lance through his body a century since
now that a city had grown up round the
old castle it served as a citadel and the
arsenal of the towns train-band the
captain of that train-band together with
most of the other municipal officers had
been placed under arrest for their loyalty
was open to question and duncan was
taking no chances of letting any man
escape who might have an interest in the
death of the kings justiciar

  his severity caused the townsfolk to
mutter ominously for it was plain that
they regarded the murder as the work
of some supernatural power had they
not seen the dagger stand forth in carfraes
breast with no hand raised to plant it
there then why were peaceful burgesses
thrown into prison when a thousand men
had seen them standing innocently by at the
commission of the deed

  discontent was doubly dangerous in
kinlochan in the heart of the district
infested by evan the outlaw the head-
less as men called him the brigand
was credited with uncanny powers he had
the entire countryside in terror of him
his raids were swift irresistible though
all that territory had suffered at his hands
no man had ever seen his face for he
appeared always in full armor with his face
concealed by the vizor of his helmet the
superstitious countryfolk said that he was

an evil spirit and whispered that there was
no head within that helmet nothing but a
grinning skull it was this superstition
which had given him his title

  but cruel and uncanny as he was he
had stood by robert young malcolms
unsuccessful rival to the throne with a
devotion which won him as much affection
from the men of kinlochan as they dared
show he never raided this town and he
shared the proceeds of his pillage with the
rash young townsmen who smuggled across
the near-by highland border moreover
if kinlochan was loyal to the boy-king
malcolm with its head it was loyal to the
defeated robert with its sentimental heart
and evan was a hero to the townsfolk if
he was something of a terror to them also

  duncan mclvor knew that he and his
company of spearmen stood in grave danger
if evan chose this all too opportune mo-
ment for a dash into the city the grumbling
citizens were almost certain to join hands
with the outlaw the kings men were too
few to hold the walls against a numerous
and determined enemy with treason menac-
ing them from within therefore detach-
ing just enough men to hold the city gate
and patrol the streets at night he called
in the rest of his command at sunset and
posted them in the keep this at least
he could hold and keep the kings flag
flying till his messenger could summon
reenforcements from the capital

  standing in the red light that streamed
in through one of the narrow slits pierced
in the stone wall for archers to shoot
through he examined the fatal dagger
the devils dagger as townsfolk and
soldiers called it never in his life had
he seen such a weapon about twelve
inches long it had a simple cross-hilt that
was flush with the sides of the thick blade
the blade itself was flat and instead of
tapering toward the point it broadened
out like a spearhead so that it was very
heavy near the point which was ground
both for piercing and for cutting the
haft had no pommel but was blunt square
and very rough at the end

  a bad weapon for a fight duncan
mused ill-balanced but apt for throwing
yet this was not thrown at least not by
any mortal man but that earl carfrae
was slain by the devil i will not admit for
there are too many in this town who would
have been glad to do it
the devils dagger

   he searched the steel for a smiths mark
and at last he found one or the almost
obliterated trace of one near the guard
it had been nearly filed out and then
smoothed over skilfully he could barely

make out the letters -rg-i

  no scottish mark that he commented
it is an outland weapon why should
the devil use a foreign blade when there
are enough smiths here to supply him if
it had been made in scotland i should have
laid the deed to evan the headless or to
one of his cutthroats

  an iron-studded door opened and a man-
at-arms entered

   there is a fellow here to speak with you
captain he announced

  who sends him

  cospatricks daughter

  bid him enter duncan commanded
and the soldier thrust a cringing servant
into the room

   the fellow stood twirling his leather cap
in his hands plainly frightened

  well duncan queried say on man
theres naught to fear

  the lady margaret commands me
the servant stammered to ask your lord-
ship if you would see her

   smiling at the unmerited title the scared
fellow gave him mclvor asked

  surely she would not come here it
is a poor place for a lady

  she would have you come to her fathers
house if your lordship pleases

  i will come at once duncan answered
with alacrity that surprised himself is
it far my lad

   across the square two streets down and
up a wynd the servant replied

i and you dare refuse to release
my father when you know him to
be innocent margarets brown
eyes flashed with a scorn that was near
hatred

  i did not say that i knew him to be
innocent duncan protested i know
that he did not strike the blow and his
face is that of an honest man but the town
has an ill repute and i can not swear that
any man in it may not have had a hand in
the murder

   but you believe in him the girl urged
almost tearfully

  what i believe matters little the
kings regent will send his deputy to judge

the case i have nothing to do with his
verdict and most certainly i can not set
the provost free except by the deputys
order i will speak to him favorably con-
cerning your father that is all i can do
the whole town will speak for him
we have no need of your intercession the
girl replied her up curling i should not
have expected a womans word to move
you when mercy and justice will not
mercy and justice are not in my hands
duncan remarked quietly would you
have me false to my duty to please you

  i see that you would not stir a finger
to please me she flashed back i can
not ask you to go for you have taken my
very house from me and allow me to remain
in it only by sufferance

  you need not ask me i am going
but if it will give you any comfort i am
doing all in my power to find the murderer
and if i succeed and it is proved that the
provost had no dealings with him your
father will be freed i think i could name
the villain now but to lay hands on him is
a harder matter

  margaret started forward impulsively
forgive me for my harsh words she
cried i was beside myself with grief
in heavens name who is the man

   if i am not mistaken it was the one man
who had most to gain by the justiciars
death i do not yet know what devilish
arts he used but i feel sure that evan the
headless slew him

  oh do not name that man margaret
cried her face pale with terror his spies
are in every household to breathe a word
against him is death

  nevertheless if he dares come within
reach of my arm i will do my best to bring
the deed home to him duncan assured
her he will be evan the headless in
very truth if he shows himself in kin-
lochan

  the curtains parted and malcolm car-
michaels bold sinister face smiled at them
across the room

  this is foolish talk he gibed evan
knows more than to thrust his neck into
the snare he appears only when he is not
looked for

  duncan flushed angrily

  master cordwainer he said i have
warned you twice not to interfere in the
kings business i warn you now for the
last time i know not who let you into


adventure

this house but it is the kings house for the
present and it is no longer open to you
if i ever find you in it again i will put you
in safe-keeping

  carmichael did not so much as look at
him

  by your leave margaret he addressed
the girl i must find fault with you for
dealing with this kings man when you
have good friends to help you i grieve
much that your father is falsely imprisoned
and i will do all i can to bring him back
to you safely i ask but one reward if i suc-
ceed and you know what that is i leave
you now since i am forbidden to stay
and with a sneering smile at duncan he
disappeared through the curtains

  replacing his helmet duncan turned to
follow him but margaret stopped him

  my uncle martin gillespie will go with
you she said and opening a panel in the
further wall she called twice

  in a moment a short pursy man came in
puffing with exertion his great stomach
shaking at every step he kissed the girl
bowed to duncan and took the young
mans arm

  when they reached the darkest spot in
the pitch-black wynd gillespie stopped
and drew duncan toward him

  it were best for all concerned master
mclvor he whispered if ye left the
provosts door unbarred this night and sent
the guard away

  what do you mean duncan asked in
indignant surprise

  not so loud the fat man wheezed
it may mean death if we are overheard
are ye fond of the sight of blood young
man do ye like to see good men killed
for nothing

  are you mad duncan replied

  it is you who are mad the townsfolk
love their provost if ye hang him they will
throw themselves upon you then there
will be a deal of killing much harmless
blood will be spilt and the good town of
kinlochan will be laid waste i love this
town young man and i would not see
these ill things happen therefore i warn
you let the provost escape ye need not
fear for yourself when the deputy comes
you say that evan the headless surprised
the guard and took him away a few
hacked swords and a little pigs blood will
give color to the tale and many men will
thank you for it

  duncan took gillespies face in his hands
and held it close to his own

  look you he said i have as much
regard for innocent lives as you have i
would do anything honest to avoid blood-
shed i have given my men orders to keep
peace with the townsfolk at all hazards
but what you propose is not honest and
i will not listen to it the provost stays
in prison till the deputy comes

  who is the deputy gillespie asked

  i do not know it will probably be the
earl of ross who is near by and has the
high low and middle justice

  the merchant groaned

  ross he cried  black david
there is neither pity nor justice in himl
he is as just as he is stern duncan con-
tradicted his verdict will be fair and
he turned to go

  the other dragged at his arm

  wait he pleaded if ye will do
nothing for our sakes consider yourselves
though the townsfolk are too weak to with-
stand you they may not be alone let
cospatrick go

  duncan turned on him

  so evan the headless is with you it
is unsafe to tell such treason to a kings
officer

  i never spoke his name gillespie pro-
tested i am no traitor good sir

  then you will do well to wait till the
deputy comes mclvor sternly admonished
him

  the merchants distress was pitiful
but i tell ye he whined it is
death to wait the blood of many men
will be on your head let him go at
once if ye wait till tomorrow it may be
too late

  duncan tore himself away

  you are either mad or a traitor he said
scornfully for mistress margarets sake
i will call you mad and let you go but do
not approach me again

  leaving gillespie quaking in the dark-
ness the young captain returned to the
keep there he found a messenger from
the capital dusty with hard riding

  the regent can not send reinforce-
ments he reported the islesmen are up
in arms and he needs every man but the
earl of ross will be here with a small escort
by noon tomorrow he bids you have a
gallows built in front of the church before
he comes
the devils dagger



detailing kilbeggie and three
men to this task duncan went
to his quarters and pondered over
the things he had heard at first he
thought only of carmichaels strong evil
face and arrogant speech there was
something under the mans boldness or
he would hardly have been so ready with
his promises to free the provost nor would
he have dared show his ill-will so openly
and what was the reward he expected from
margaret

  the man can not be in love with her
he muttered a mere cordwainer

  but the thought suited well with car-
michaels insolent behavior he was a man
who would dare much duncan felt

  he shuddered at the idea of this fellow
in possession of so lovely and spirited a
girl and suddenly it came over him that
such a thing would be more terrible to him
than any death

  st andrew he cried to himself am
i to fall in love with the daughter of a man
who may be swinging in a rope this time
tomorrow and after a moments re-
flection what if i do he asked
whether he be hanged or not i believe
him honest and his daughter is fair enough
and good enough for any man and come
what will i will not let that vile cord-
wainer have her

  but he knew that the morrow might
bring trouble the sight of the provost at
the gallows foot might stir the already
restless townsmen to fury if it came to a
fight and there were anything in gillespies
implied threat that evan the headless
would bring his outlaws into the battle
then duncan himself would almost certainly
die

  if carmichael is one of them- he
cried

  yes if carmichael was in evans pay
then defeat for the kings troops would
mean that margaret would fall into car-
michaels hands she was doubtless prom-
ised to the man as a reward of his treason

  she shall know of it however he
resolved and took inkhorn and parchment
thanking his stars for the chance that he
had been brought up in a monastery a
little later he dispatched the following
letter by a trooper

to mistress margaret cospatrick

   i	who have brought your father into peril of his
life who may yet be the instrument of his death

confess without shame that i love you if your
father is acquitted tomorrow i shall ask him for
your hand if not you shall hear of me no more
but whatever happens i will not abate one jot
of my duty to the king beware of carmichael
i have reason to believe him a traitor and a spy of
evans farewell and the saints be with you

duncan mcivor servicns regis

  his mind cleared by this confession he
reverted almost instantly to the interview
with gillespie as he went over it in his
mind five words sang themselves in his ears
with more and more significance-
morning may be too late

  he sprang to his feet

  would to god i had questioned that
fat dolt more closely he reproached him-
self he knows more than i gave him
credit for here henderson

  the lantern-jawed patrol leader had
ridden in at sunset to report the district
quiet and no sign of evan and his outlaws
he now appeared promptly though yawn-
ing and obviously saddle-sore

  take charge here ordered duncan
i go to the city gate to consult with
jamieson there on matters of importance
and may not be back till dawn

  without waiting for an answer he
snatched up a black cloak to hide the
gleam of his mail and crossed the city to
where his second in command kept restless
watch at the gate

  best take a patrol with you captain
he urged when mclvor told him of his
suspicions and his intention to probe them
personally

  how many can you spare me of your
score asked dunam

  not one-we are too few to hold the

gate-house now-

  the same is true of the keep inter-
rupted duncan so i go alone-to ques-
tion a fat old carle who could not harm a
hare remember your duty and hen-
dersons is to hold the town till the deputy
comes farewell

  as mclvor readjusted his cloak and
turned away jamieson saw that he was
carrying stuck through his belt the devils
dagger-at midnight too when as all men
know the evil one has power the super-
stitious borderer crossed himself and gave
up all hope of ever seeing his young officer
alive again

  the moon was up but the streets and
houses of kinlochan were otherwise dark
for the captain had given orders for all


adventure

citizens to be at home and in bed by the
curfew hour now long past as duncan
crossed a side street a man stole out of a
house-door closely muffled duncan seized
him by the arm the man started vio-
lently

  where does martin gillespie live
duncan questioned

  trembling in his grasp the man pointed
up the street

  two turns to the left and at the end of
a close he answered

  and now what are you doing out at
this hour

  the fellow faltered

  back in with you and do not stir out-
side your door again tonight on pain of
death snapped mclvor

  the other bolted into his house like a
rabbit into its burrow

  as he entered into the close to which the
culprit had directed him duncan heard a
door creak on its hinges and flattened him-
self against the high wall which formed the
side of a tall rambling house watching in-
tently he saw a hooded figure steal out softly
and shut the door behind it straining his
eyes he made out a massive shape between
him and the moonlight a familiar shape with
the only stomach of its size in kinlochan
it was martin gillespie

 but though he had come to question
this very man the citizens illegal appear-
ance at midnight changed the course of
duncans intentions he recognized at
once that if there was any mischief afoot
gillespies nocturnal sortie was proof not
only of his knowledge of it but of his
complicity clearly however much he
desired to avoid bloodshed he was still
more anxious to free the provost for
that there was a plot to free the provost
by force if necessary duncan no longer
doubted

  tiptoeing cautiously toward the street
he followed his mans portly figure to the
turn down a narrow winding side street
to the rear entrance of a large six-story
house with a high-pitched many-angled
roof and a wilderness of chimneys gil-
lespie mounted the steps and looked about
apprehensively duncan dropped to the
cobblestones just in time and heard the
merchant knock at the door four times in
rapid succession instantly the door swung
open and closed again as soon as gillespie
was inside

  waiting long enough to avert suspicion
duncan wound his cloak about his face
loosened his sword in its scabbard and
judging that the knock was a signal rapped
four times as gillespie had done

  the door opened at once the hall was
dark a hand fell on his and guided him
down a long passage at last his guide
knocked at an invisible door and a blaze
of light burst upon them stepping over
the threshold duncan found himself in
an interior room without windows and
ventilated only by a small air-shaft across
the room a fire was burning in a grate
around which stood or sat a dozen armed
men among them duncan recognized
five of the most prominent and orderly
citizens of kinlochan the rest were ob-
viously of the poorer sort but all resolute-
looking fellows he noticed with dis-
appointment that carmichael was not
among them

in his excitement duncan allowed
the cloak to drop from about his
head and his polished helmet caught
and threw back the firelight instantly
confusion broke loose those who were
seated leaped to their feet some made for
the darkest comers of the room others
pressed forward toward him fumbling at
their sword-hilts at once duncan drew
his own sword and prepared for defense
the room echoed with angry shouts of
kill the kings man cut him to pieces
yet none seemed anxious to be the first to
face his blade

  from the angle of the chimney martin
gillespie shouldered forward thrusting his
great stomach through the press with an
effort which left him gasping he hoisted
himself up on to the top of a massive table
and panting for breath brought out a shout
that made the conspirators pause

  harm him not he cried it was he
who imprisoned ronald cospa trick seize
him but wound him not we will hold him
as hostage for the provosts safety

  here was the moment on which duncan
had counted when he might by cool
reasoning and his own promise to say no
word of this meeting to the authorities
dissuade the citizens from violence and
armed rebellion but before he could
speak a panel opened in the wall beside the
chimney there came the clank of mail
a shrill whistle and a gleaming figure
the devils dagger



strode into the room duncan his sword
still outthrust in defense stared at the
newcomer in amazement he was a tall
powerfully built man in shining mail his
face completely concealed by the vizor
of his helmet

  you crack-brained fools the armored
man said quietly but in a voice that
pierced through and silenced the din
you will have the troops here in a moment
kill this fellow quietly and be done
with it

  but good evan gillespie protested
would it not be more prudent to hold him
as a hostage if we slay him the kings
spearmen will butcher us all

  the kings troops will have enough to do
to save their own lives the outlaw an-
swered this lad here is both brain and
heart to them put him out of the way
and his men will offer small resistance to-
morrow consider men of kinlochan
if mclvor escapes he will bring a charge
of high treason against all of you and then
it will be hey for a short grace and a long
rope now kill him quickly or i will call my
men off and leave you in the lurch

  believing all his enemies were in front of
him duncan had waited calmly until the
outlaw furnished him with all the informa-
tion he wished but he was speedily un-
deceived a light appeared at the far end
of the corridor the sound of many feet
came toward him and before he could dash
for the street door that too swung open
letting in two tall fellows in steel caps who
struck at him fiercely with long knives

  duncan had no room to strike back
besides with armored men on both sides
of him his position was untenable there
was only one way out forward through
the crowded room at least most of his
opponents there were half-trained peace-
loving citizens swinging his sword he
plunged straight ahead striking to right
and left with the flat unused to desperate
fighting the townsmen made way before
him or fell headlong beneath his blows
until the captain stood within striking
distance of evan the headless with no one
between to save the outlaw from his stroke
duncan raised his sword felt a weapon
thud against the stanch steel rings on his
back and realized instantly that he had no
time to fight

  lowering his point he dealt evan a
mighty blow with his left fist against the

meshed mail covering the throat the
outlaw fell heavily still struggling to
release his sword from the scabbard in
which it was jammed like a flash
duncan leapt over the prostrate man
through the panel and found himself at
the foot of a secret stair lighted with candles
stuck in sconces on the wall he slammed
the panel shut and dashed up the stair
extinguishing the candles behind him as he
ran the stair wound in a spiral without
so much as a door opening from it story
up after story

  behind him the well roared with the
clatter of his pursuers feet upon the wooden
treads clad as he was in complete chain-
mail his breath came shorter and shorter
till he no longer blew out the candles as
he passed them but struck them out with
his hand if there were only a door
through which he might dodge what if
this way led him into an impasse a room
from which there was no exit but trap
or no trap he must go through it to the
end

  suddenly he shot out through an open
door into a large meagerly furnished room
slamming the door behind him duncan
hunted for and found a bolt and shot it
just as the first of the pursuers hurled him-
self against the other side of the door
looking for something to barricade it with
duncan laid hands on the large table
on which a candle was burning in the
center of the room his eyes fell on a piece
of parchment beside the candle it was
his own letter to margaret cospatrick

  but it was more than his own writing
added to it like a postscript were the
following lines

malcolm carmichael

  i know by this that you are a traitor for the
sake of the love you say you have for me i will
not give you over to the soldiers but i command
you to leave kinlochan at once and never look upon
my face again if you have had a part in the
crime of which my father is falsely accused and i
ever obtain proof of it i will denounce you

margaret cospatrick

  the crashing impact of a heavy battle-ax
on the other side of the bolted door and the
gleam of its edge through the splintering
panel recalled duncan to a sense of his
present danger hastily placing the parch-
ment within his helmet he thrust the table
against the door leading to the secret stair
across the room was another door with a


adventure

great iron key in the massive lock bound-
ing over to it he whipped out the key
opened the door sprang through closed
and locked it from the outside

  looking about him duncan now found
himself in a long narrow attic lit by the
moonlight streaming in through a solitary
dormer window at the far end half-way
between him and the window the head of
a staircase rose through the dusty floor
here was a possible means of escape to
the street and duncan hastened to it
eagerly but even as he did so there came
a rush of feet on the floor below and a
throng of men swept swiftly up the stair
their leader a tall fellow armed with sword
and buckler gave a joyous cry at the sight
of the captains figure outlined against the
moonlit window

i quick as thought duncan
 dropped his own sword and laid
hold of a great iron-bound clothes-
chest that stood beside him at the
head of the stair with the strength of
desperation he heaved it up at arms
length above his head at the sight of
the huge bulk poised black and threaten-
ing before him the leader of the attackers
crouched behind his upraised shield but
in vain like a stone from a catapult
the monstrous missile came crashing down
crushing the life out of two men transfixing
a third upon the sword of the man behind
him and sweeping them all into a tangled
shrieking heap at the bottom of the stair

  a sudden thunder of blows on the other
side of the locked door told duncan that
those who had pursued him up the secret
stair would soon be through into the attic
through the cries and curses of the wounded
he could hear more men coming up the
lower flights of the staircase he had just
cleared obviously there was no escape
for him that way nor could he hope to hold
the stairway against attack from both front
and rear

  running lightly to the far end of the
attic duncan climbed through the narrow
window out on to the steeply sloping roof
there he took up his position to the right
of the window and a half-step higher up
the roof his left hand resting on the ridge
of the little dormer his sword upraised and
ready soon he heard the door of the inner
room come crashing down in an instant
the attic seemed full of men shaking the

house as they rushed back and forth across
the floor overturning chests and boxes and
thrusting their sword-points into every nook
and comer

  presently a man wearing a steel cap
went to the window and put his head out
still wearing the steep cap his head rolled
down the slope of the roof fell over the edge
and lodged in a sort of valley between two
lower gables

  those within came thronging to where
the headless trunk lay by the window in a
widening pool of blood that looked like ink
in the moonlight but no man offered to
step across it and beneath the terrible blade
that they knew was waiting outside

  come evan the headless called
duncan in grim mockery what have
you to fear

  but evan stirred not nor made reply
till one of his followers suggested that some
of them go out another window

  this is the only window from which this
part of the roof can be reached duncan
heard the deep voice of the outlaw say
decisively we have the young fool safely
trapped now bar fast the shutter post
four to watch here and leave the rest to me
a solid shutter of heavy boards was
promptly placed in the unsashed window
and made fast from within

  thus left alone on the roof of the house
duncan sheathed his sword climbed to the
high-pitched ridge-pole and looked about
him by the bright light of a nearly full
moon he was trapped indeed on the top
of a sort of tower that rose fully two stories
above the rest of the house there was
not as much as a chimney-pot for him to
take cover behind and at any moment
he might hear the twang of a bowstring
from a dark corner of the roof below and
feel a cloth-yard shaft tear through his shirt
of mail listening apprehensively he sud-
denly heard a voice the voice of martin
gillespie speak these words apparently
in his very ear

  evan had best haste over the wall and
ride hard if he is to bring his two hundred
lances here by tomorrow noon

  in his astonishment duncan nearly fell
to his death in the street below looking
about him he discovered a low hooded
opening in the roof and realized that it was
the top of the airshaft ventilating the room
on the ground floor where the conspirators
met but the shaft was far too narrow for
the devils dagger



his broad shoulders ever to squeeze through
he must find some other means of escape

  then there came to duncans ears the
blessed sound of the tramp of disciplined
feet and he knew that one of his own patrols
was passing by a shout rose to his lips
but he checked it realizing that to call out
thus from the housetops would almost
certainly rouse the town and start a general
fight that otherwise might be avoided-
for now he knew that the other side would
not be ready to strike till tomorrow noon

  by the loom of st andrews cathedral
tower against the sky duncan saw that
this great rambling house on whose roof
he sat was much nearer than lie had realized
to the square so much so that its front
in all probability faced on it if he could
but work his way to that end of the roof
he might succeed in attracting the attention
of the patrol without giving the alarm

  swinging his right leg over the ridgepole
duncan made his way down the moonless
side of the roof cautiously for the slope was
steep and the old moss-grown slates were
slippery half-way down he turned and
began to walk as fast as he dared along the
slope toward the front he was two-thirds
of the way there when without an instants
warning a cracked slate snapped off and
broke away beneath his tread his feet flew
out from under him he fell heavily on his
right side and shot feet foremost down the
slope and over the edge of the roof

  st andrew save me he prayed as he
fell through the dark

  then he struck not as he had feared
on the pavement but on the lower roof
this also sloped so steeply that his fall was
not broken abruptly but again turned into
a slide down he shot with increasing
velocity for now he was in a sort of trough
between two gables slippery with slime
left there by the rains of many winters
vainly clutching for any handhold he felt
his legs shoot over the edge of the roof
and his body follow and fall once more
straight down this time to certain death
then miraculously his hands touched and
gripped something hard and round

  looking up duncan saw that he was
hanging at arms length from a long water-
spout with its mouth shaped like a dragons
head just such a gargoyle as then projected
from the eyes of any large dwelling or may
be seen grinning from the tower of a gothic
cathedral today thanks to his wearing

chain-mail his skin was untorn and he was
none the worse save for a few bruises
silently thanking st andrew duncan
began to pull himself up to climb on the
lower roof and there try his fortunes anew
but before he had raised himself an inch
he saw something that so startled him that
he nearly relaxed his hold on the waterspout

  directly in front of him as he hung and
perhaps a dozen feet away the side of the
house was built out at right angles
through a window in this wing duncan
could now look down into a lighted room
where beside a table on which a candle
was burning loomed the mail-clad bulk of
evan the headless the outlaw appeared
to be talking with some one who sat on the
other side of the table all that duncan
could see of this person was a lean brown
hand that rested on the table where the
candlelight was brightest what startled
him was that this hand was clutching a
duplicate of the devils dagger

where is duncan mclvor who
should command here

  black david earl of ross sat
on his horse in the city gate and glowered
down at the unhappy jamieson wriggling
under the merciless black eyes of the kings
deputy the embarrassed borderer stam-
mered out a tangled tale of midnight and
devils daggers and black magic the gist
of which was that the captain had disap-
peared and that the search parties jamieson
had sent out had failed to find the slightest
trace of him

  fool said black david contemptu-
ously when you had the provost and
half the other town-officers in the keep
a touch of hot coals to their feet or a few
twists of a cord round their skulls and
they would have told all out of the way
there forward

  followed by his own scanty escort of ten
mounted men-at-arms and forty archers
the earl of ross rode unwelcomed through
the streets of kinlochan contrary to the
wont of folk whose town is visited by a
kings deputy the people had not assembled
in the square to witness the spectacle and
the trial at every house-door however
and at every street-corner men were wait-
ing in grim and ominous silence not a
woman or a child was to be seen except
here and there at a high window the
shutters of which were half-closed


adventure

  ross knew the signs and prepared for
battle in an incredibly short time after
he had ridden in through the entrance to
the keep he rode out again clad now in full
armor behind him marched his own half-
hundred and most of mclvors company
the latter guarding the provost the captain
of the train-band and the other municipal
officers in chains marshaling his men
in battle array at the foot of the gallows
black david ordered the hostages to mount
the scaffold

one other person was asking in an
anguish of suspense where is
duncan mclvor it was mar-
garet cospatrick who sat watching the
ominous preparations from the balcony
of a window overlooking the scaffold
not all her uncles protestations could
persuade her to withdraw behind the
shutters

  he said he would find the murderer
she insisted and unless harm comes to him
he will

  i tell ye lass he must be dead the
merchant urged he would not fail to
meet the earl otherwise the town rings
with rumors of his murder at the hands of
the outlaws

  prudent martin was not the man to con-
fess his own part in duncans disappear-
ance

  it would take more than a few cowardly
outlaws to kill him margaret flashed
and he is not the man to leave a helpless
girl without comfort when her father is at
the point of death

  the frantic martin was moved to rude-
ness

  one would say ye were foolish over the
lad he exploded it does not become
a decent girl whose father is about to hang
to waste grief on one of iris murderers

  the girl turned on him her face scarlet

  martin gillespie she cried the tears
gathering in her eyes if you were twice
my uncle you have no right to talk of me
thus or to abuse a good man aye he is a
good man he did but do his duty and
then threw himself into peril for my sake
for all we know he may be lying dead for
my sake this moment he loved me and
if he comes back alive i will not forget what
he did for my love

  martin gillespie became purple and
choked

be it made known in the name
of the king that the town of kin-
lochan is held suspect of the murder
of sir hugh kennedy earl of carfrae
justiciar of his majesty be it known that
the said town is also suspect of making way
with and murdering one duncan mclvor
in command of the kings troops occupy-
ing the said town wherefore in the
kings name i david earl of ross
deputy for the king do hereby command
that unless the murderer or murderers be
produced within half the space of an hour
the provost and officers of the said town
of kinlochan be duly and well hanged
in satisfaction of the kings vengeance

  the heralds trumpet was drowned out
by a prolonged howl of hate and fury from
tire grimly waiting men in house-doors and
street-corners through their outcries
rang another trumpet blown three times
from without the wall a cloud of dust
through which came the gleam of lance-
points bore down on the city gate out
from the nearest houses came rushing a
throng of townsmen who had been waiting
for this moment and signal before the
startled jamieson and his twenty could
turn and strike a blow they were over-
powered and the gate-house captured
round whirled the windlasses down
dropped the drawbridge up creaked the
portcullis and open flew the gates of
kinlochan

  with thunder of hoofs and jangle of mail
two hundred horse swept through the city
gate boot to boot they rode in column
of fours with lances in rest over their
armor they wore black tabards at their
head rode evan the outlaw his face
concealed by the bars of his vizor at
the sight of him the jubilant townsmen
burst forth from doors streets and alleys
brandishing swords pikes and lochaber
axes

  black david his face cold and stern
signaled to his herald who blew loudly
just as the combined forces of the citizens
and outlaws poured into the side of the
square opposite the cathedral and the
gallows thinking this the sign of sur-
render the people stopped and listened
eagerly

  as an example to all traitors let ronald
cospatrick and his accomplices be hanged
at once cried the earl

  the townsmen stared at each other
the devils dagger



aghast for a single moment then frenzy
seized them and they surged toward the
scaffold evan the headless waved to
his outlaws who were wheeling into line
down came the lance-points couched for the
charge the earl of ross roared an order
his archers bent their bows the men-at-arms
locked shields and formed an unbroken
hedge of spears the hangman placed the
noose round ronald cospatricks neck

  hold stay the execution here is the
murderer a voice rang clear and high
through the startled square

  duncan mclvor burst through the ragged
disarray of the townsmen half-dragging a
little dark man with frightened eyes who
held in one hand something large and
cumbrous wrapped in green cloth in the
other hand held high over his head by
duncans iron fingers round his wrist he
clutched a strangely shaped knife for all
to see

  the devils dagger cried a hundred
voices among the townsmen  and look
the outlander has its fellow in his girdle

  heed him not-it is but a trick of the
kings men shouted evan the headless
on-on and save your provost

  but the men of kinlochan were now
beginning to feel that their provost was
saved already without any need of their
risking their own necks they saw the
deputy sign to the hangman to wait and
to the captain to bring his prisoner nearer
they looked at the troops standing there
so steady and silent-and instinctively
they stood and grew silent themselves
they would not charge and without them
evan dared not

  had he done so had he hurled his two
hundred wild riders across the square he
would certainly have trampled duncan
and his prisoner to death and perhaps have
broken the shield wall and won the day
no one there knew this better than the
kings deputy yet for all the notice black
david took of evan and his band the
outlaws might have been a weeks ride
away and that if evan had but known
black david better was a bad sign

  captain mclvor he said to duncan
sternly where have you been this long
time and who is this fellow you bring
before me

  one whom i met up with on the roof of
yonder tall house last night answered
duncan gravely he was there for the


purpose of putting one of those strange
daggers of his into me as he did into sir
hugh kennedy but being closer than
he thought i took him by the neck and
held him over the edge of the roof till he
confessed all then there being no other
way off the roof i had him take me to his
room--a secret room which has a little
round window or loophole most cunningly
concealed among the carved stonework
across the front of the house there i
waited till those others in the house who
would not have let me depart alive rushed
out into the street but now

  what is your name black david
demanded but the accused made no reply

  ridolfo is his name-he is a native of
genoa said duncan the other nodding
assent your lordship can speak with him
in french as i did for he knows no
scottish

  do you confess to the murder of the
kings justiciar black david asked in
halting french and received a calm affirm-
ative

  being an outlander you had no quarrel
with the dead man black david pursued
who suborned you to do it

  now with the gallows before him the
italian instinctively looked for help to the
source from which he had often received it
before he looked full at evan eyes be-
seeching the outlaw to rescue him but
evan fearful that the man would betray
him and glad of a chance to save his own
face and retire with some show of dignity
cried out loudly

  if yon outlander is the murderer hang
him and be done i came here to see
justice hang him

  ridolfo guessed the answer from his
masters tone and his dark eyes sparkled
with hate

  wait duncan protested if it please
your lordship let the man show how the
murder was done

  show black david commanded
removing the cloth from his burden
ridolfo displayed a short thick steel bow
set in a heavy stock to which a small wind-
lass was attached near the grip at the
fore-end was a steel stirrup this ridolfo
planted on the ground placed one foot in
it and with both hands revolved the cranks
that drew back the string to where it was
caught and held by a trigger then setting
the blunt rough pommel of the dagger to


adventure

the drawn string as if it were a bolt or
arrow the italian held up to the gaze of
deputy and people-a genoese cross-bow
the first ever seen or heard of in scotland
thus holding it with duncans arm over
his hand to prevent treachery he whispered
in duncans ear and duncan said softly
to the earl

  it was evan the outlaw who ordered the
crime i beg your grace to grant this man
his life he has dealt faithfully with me
with a cold smile black david nodded
touched ridolfos arm and pointed to evan
the headless whose horsemen were now
commencing a steady and well-ordered
retreat secure in the knowledge that black
david had but ten mounted men-at-arms
and that he would be loth to risk loosing
a volley of arrows across the crowded square
while the temper of the townsmen was still
uncertain for heavy-armed infantry to
pursue and overtake retreating cavalry was
of course impossible

  as the earl pointed ridolfo understood
and so did evan fear clutched at his
heart with a wild cry he clapped spurs to
his horse even as ridolfo took aim and shot
the dagger cleaving two hundred feet of
space too fast for eye to follow struck the
rider full between the shoulders with a
sound like the blow of an ax the dreaded
outlaw fell from his horse and sprawled
on the pavement in wild disarray his
followers spurred their horses into a gallop
and plunged colliding and hurtling each
other to the ground for the city gate and
through it

  go you said black david to a soldier
and unlace his helmet

  the man obeyed cutting the laces he
plucked off the steel head-piece and held
the dead mans head so that all could see
his face a loud shout of stupefaction rose
from all parts of the square evan the
headless was malcolm carmichael

  signing for silence black david ad-
dressed the people

  justice is done he said i restore
ronald cospatrick to all his honors and
offices and i give freedom to his fellow
officers some of them may have been a
thought disloyal but he who misled them
is punished and i pardon them ridolfo
the italian is free to go and come where
he likes so long as he does not remain in
scotland as for duncan mclvor who
found the murderer and solved the vexed
matter of the devils dagger i can promise
him an ample reward at the kings hands
henderson strike off the prisoners chains
and then go see how jamieson and his
fellows fare at the gate mclvor will come
back to scone with me and tell the regent
how he unearthed this business

  the townsfolk cheered themselves hoarse
tossing their caps in the air they rushed
toward duncan loading him with praise
and admiration but duncan burst from
them and ran to the scaffold where mar-
garet cospatrick lay sobbing on the rough
planks clasping her fathers knees ten-
derly duncan raised her up she turned
looked into his eyes and threw her arms
about him

as it happens the former letter from
peas river read at our camp-fire
brought an inquiry from an army officer
connected with some of the people men-
tioned in that letter-a kind of uninten-
tional lost trails accomplishment such
as happens every little while through our
camp-fire meetings this second letter
also dealing with western old-timers is
self-explanatory i leave in the part about
our movement for good citizenship it serves
as sample of the magnificent response to the
call to good americans-the response that
assures the practical success of the ameri-
can league for citizenship

  concerning my letter in your first march issue i
wish to correct a mistake it was a t boger not
boyer that was appointed sheriff of wilbarger co
texas when tom stewart was ousted i am sorry
i am such a poor scribe some one will pick me up on
that sure that is why i hasten to correct it

   read with pleasure d wiggins letter especially
that part about chalk bteson bill hart and the
single-action colt by the way that was the only
kind of a revolver to be found in the west in an early
day if i see bill advertised i will sure drop in and
see that old colt may be it wont be the first time
ive seen it

  the best thing i have read in adventure or any
place else is a creed for americans that is fine
all we need is to get enough people educated along
these lines and we can do the thing we want to do-
build a good house out of good bricks-peas

from thomas e webb of camden
arkansas comes the suggestion of a
monument in new york to the memory of
jack london what if old jack could
but look back and behold in the presence
of a huge marble the esteem in which he
was held writes mr webb theres
not an adventure-loving man in all america
england or where not but would contribute
his share toward such a monument

  that seems to me a good idea how do
the rest of you feel about it if a guar-
anteed committee of some kind were formed

i dare say the money would come in freely
personally im already carrying all the work
i can tote-more i judge from what it did
to me the first few months of -but
perhaps adventure could if desired serve
as a repository for contributions our re-
sponsibility ceasing when the total was paid
over to the committee

what kind of monument i should
say something simple and solid how
much money should be collected where
should it be placed what inscription

  i do not know mr webb personally but
perhaps it would be the best plan for all
interested to write to him and shape up a
definite course of action there ought to
be a monument to jack london and from
whom could it come more fittingly than
from the adventurers who gather about the
camp-fire from all over the world

  there are many yanks in this camp from maine

mostly not a few are very homesick yet as an
average they are doing their bit as men many of
them are holding some office as n c o and some
have commissions as lieutenants and captains we
have enough to eat and good quarters as soldiering
goes-better than i had in mexico under villa or
madcro-and no fighting yet plenty of amuse-
ments wet and dry canteens cinemas or movies
concerts as there is some splendid talent in the
ranks but i miss my java here it is tea or

and what a medley of dialects scots irish

sociology or hobo-ology any way its interesting
especially when i enter the dining-hut to hear a
welsh orderly say two more mans up this way
and if you were lo be transported to our sleeping
quarters about nine pm and woke up you would
wonder if you had fallen into a nut factory and
whether they used chloroform on the poor things

  but they are a fairly good-natured bunch i
have many warm friends among both men and
officers and expect a raise in rank soon i am win-
ning it here as well as in mexico honduras the
u s a and some others on my merits only from
the ranks up it is not so easy here lots of red
tape savvy

t am full of real news and copy but no use writing
it to be torpedoed by the censor but i can tell
you something about the country its quaint old
houses with tile and thatched roofs old wind-mills
castles with walls twenty feet thick-they all look
like oil paintings-and canals tall bridges large
pasture-lands filled with sheep and they are in good
condition as the winter has been mild i was out
and picked some wild daisies to-day and was boating
on the river-no not joy-riding just a part of my
duty in the salvage corps of which i am the
originator the women and girls of england are
sure doing their bit in this war will tell you about
them some other time i am disgracefully healthy

a woman comrade of our writers bri-
gade they are few and far between
but always assured of friendly welcome
greeting to louise rice who gives us a story
for the first time and introduces herself
according to camp-fire custom

  this matter of discussing myself bothers me a
little ive never done any self-exploiting nor al-
lowed any one else to do it for me however i guess
there really is an excuse for it in this case if i am to
be admitted to adventures family for if i write
about thugs and bums and longshoremen and
tramps etc as im likely to do some of your men
readers will be wondering how on earth i know any-
thing about what im writing about

t think a little story will illustrate how i happen
to know more about the rough life of the world
than the majority of women i was coming home
from the opera one night and as it was unusually
mild my escort and myself started to walk home
through madison square park coming the other
way from tending his boilers in a well known build-
ing on twenty-third street came an acquaintance of
mine i would gladly have evaded him but he
planted himself before me looked me up and down
and inquired in amazement

   fer th love o mike lou whered yuh get them
glad rags

t-ie knew me merely as a rather dingy person
who had chatted with him off and on for a
year as he stood taking the air at his cellar steps
and owing to a chance word of mine about running a
typewriter he had always taken it for granted that
i was an underpaid and overworked stenographer
be it recorded to his glory and to the everlasting
honor of what are known as rough men that i

have repeatedly made friends with them in just that
way and have yet to receive from one of them a
word which would shame the finest so-called
gentleman in the land

   i did not want this particular friend to see me in
the glad rags because i did not want him to think
that i had been anything but the real friend that i
really was so i had to explain and alas i never
got another entirely frank and unconscious word out
of him but thanks to my acquaintance of the
previous year with him i know intimately and in
detail just what a man like him thinks and wants-
and i believe i could tend his boilers too

tn fact ive known about every kind of man

  and a woman that there is i guess ive been a
reporter and a rewrite woman and worked in a
big advertising office and in a motion picture
exchange and run a restaurant and had a mani-
cure shop and got five dollars an hour for doing
massage and a dollar and a half an hour for running
a gymnasium where i had every sort of person
from kids of fourteen to old men of sixty from shop-
girls to society women im really a pretty good
farmer and a well known graphologist give you
three guesses as to what that is and i love to cook
and hate to sew and if ive got a clean collar and cuffs
on i think im dressed up enough to go anywhere

  im older than youd think and i can walk
twenty miles easy and put my knuckles to the floor
without bending my knees selah-louise rice

   p s i forgot to tell you about the characters in
skirts and brats all of them are real and the
story is mainly so the names are correct red
jumbo smoky mike blond maggie chicago bessie
and larry the dip will probably be recognized if any
of their old pals read the tale jumbo married
chicago bessie of course and is the devoted step-
daddy to the twins larry brave fellow died in
trying to conquer his habit theres rather a pa-
thetic story about him which i may write some
time i dont know what became of blond maggie
but i do know that she started out to earn her living
in an honest way the mcgurks where jumbo lay
up in new york waiting for his beard to grow was
the famous mcgurks one of the best-known hang-
outs of criminals in this country on several occa-
sions myself and an escort spent a long evening in
that dreadful place successfully impersonating ha-
bitues and gathering all sorts of impressions data
and information about the underworld

nprat was in the days when new york was
wide open i spent nearly all of one year
investigating the conditions of the lower east side
for i could not believe that the stories which the
newspapers were just beginning to print about it
were true i investigated as long as i could stand
it and had to conclude that the half had not been
even whispered

  and let me add just one word you see a lot
written about the adventurous life of criminals
about their orgies and their generally gay and
daring lives well believe me the most dismal
gloomy carc-ridden people i have ever seen in my
not exactly narrow life have been criminals when
they drink they fight instead of singing when
they dont drink they fall into such depths of abys-
mal misery that even the worst of them would
arouse pity from which you can easily deduce
any number of morals
the camp-fire	

  but in the above miss rice told so little
of her real adventures that i wrote and pro-
tested so she added what follows but
even so she hasnt really done justice to a
life of adventures that would make many of
the men look to their laurels however
heres the bit more

   i have been out of town which is the reason why i
have not answered your request for more dope about
what i thought id said more than enough about i
didnt mention the fact that i really can and have
run an engine because that wasnt much of an adven-
ture-a sewing-machine is more complicated any
dub can do it

t didnt mention about roaming around with

  my friends the romanys because that isnt
much of an adventure either the safest place i
know of for man or beast is a gipsy wagon-also
you get splendiferous eats and the roof is hail-
proof and the talk is beautifully absent however
if you think it interesting to say to the readers
of adventure that ive done those things go
right ahead as an adventure i have found mak-
ing my living in new york by far the most ex-
citing and hazardous undertaking i have ever
attempted

  the gipsies are really wonderfully interesting
people but they are not the murdering knife-out
stealing wild people of the usual fiction not a-tall
-which is the reason why editors uniformly refuse
my stories about them

t thought it was rather an adventure to shingle

   a house of mine once-there was not the slight-
est danger in sitting on the ridge pole but the bat-
tery of long range glances which poured upon me
while i sat there was one of the most trying dangers
i ever endured i like to plow and harrow too
which drew an interested ring of onlookers for
several days of one radiant spring but my most
unusual feat was to carry a new broom down three
blocks of theatrical broadway one day it was not
a stunt-a friend of mine who had just rented a
studio really needed it-but you would have thought
that the wild man of borneo had just come to
town things like that leave me utterly be-
wildered why do so many people in this very
interesting and natural world connive to make
simple and natural actions so difficult but thats
nothing to do with me or this adventurous life of
mine that you insist on has it

t count as the really wonderful adventures of
 my life the many many unusual and wonderful
people whom i have met-not necessarily well
known people although there are a good many of
them but the rare human types the man or woman
who has been and gone and done things and couldnt
write a word about them to save their necks if i ever
write any good stories ill deserve no credit it will
just be a rehash of what those big people have done
come to think of it i guess my friendships are
my true excuses for cumbering this already over-
populated earth-im a sort of licensed singer
like those bards of old who earned their board
and room by reciting the deeds of those more
worthy than themselves and far far greater-

an inquiry from our comrade e a

- brininstool concerning captain dran-
nan

  if there is any old army officer who saw indian
fighting on the plains anywhere from  to 
or who took part in the apache wars or the modoc
war or who knows the particulars of the rescue of
the oatman girls from apaches i would like to ask
if he ever heard of a man named captain wm f
drannan author of a book entitled thirty-one
years on the plains drannans photo the front-
ispiece of the book shows an old man about seventy-
five in a buckskin suit and is signed by himself as
chief of scouts

trannan alleges he was raised by the cele-
brated kit carsonand that he was later a com-
panion of old jim bridger jim beckwourth buf-
falo bill and other frontier celebrities i went
carefully through the book and counted the number
of indians alleged to have been slain either by him
in person or killed by companion scouts and him-
self or by troops for whom he scouted and his own
figures give the astounding number of  redskins
the book has  pages i only counted dead in-
dians in fights in which drannan says he took part

  drannan says he also scouted for gen george
crook in arizona gen conner gen wheaton
col elliott and gen john c fremont he recites
that he personally captured capt jack chief of the
modocs personally rescued alice oatman from cap-
tivity among the apaches and was more or less
prominent in other indian scrimmages and cam-
paigns


adventure

t have read about everything of a historical
nature that i can get hold of concerning all our
indian campaigns but in no book article story or
any written documents of indian campaigns have i
ever seen this mans name mentioned in any ca-
pacity-much less as chief of scouts i know
a great many old-time indian fighters personally
and many army officers who were on the plains from
 to  and none of them ever heard of scout
drannan

  if this catches the eye of any men who served in
the regular army from  to -whether private
or officer i would like to hear from them now
then speak up you old boys who knows anything
about capt wm f drannan chief of scouts-

in a letter written in february captain
george ash asks to have it announced
to his friends that he is in japan and korea
doing well 

these stories of hugh pendexters do
more than entertain us he has stud-
ied the american indian for years and his
tales not only bring vividly before our eyes
the early years of our countrys history but
can be relied upon for accuracy in both de-
tail and spirit they make the indian and
pioneer of the past a living reality

  i find im breaking rules and praising at
camp-fire some of our own stories but per-
haps youll make allowance for the fact that
im speaking of them not because of their
fiction value but because they are doing
exactly what some of you im glad to say
arc doing-telling us facts about the days of
the frontier that has moved westward across
our country three thousand miles in three
hundred years

another story in this issue the
 devils dagger performs a similar
service as to the scotland of the old days i
like these stories of old times mixed in with
those of the present day and judging from
your letters and talks most of you feel the
same way but they must be dependable in
fact and atmosphere or the value and in-
terest are greatly lessened comrades bish-
op and brodeur like comrade pendexter
know whereof they write both have for
years been students of past civilizations and
mr brodeur-well he reads the old sagas
in the original and little things like that

  now heres a little dope on the side
from mr pendexter on his story in this
issue

                          norway maine
the story was suggested by the sacred myth of the
cherokee concerning the raven mocker which

according to james moony in his authoritative work
on cherokee mythology was the most dreaded of
all wizards and demons the cherokee firmly be-
lieved in the raven mocker once when mr
moony was among the cherokee he says page 
myths of the cherokee a sick man was allowed
to die alone because his friends imagined they felt
the presence of the raven mocker the same
authority says the grewsome belief in the raven
mocker is universal among the cherokee and has
close parallel in other tribes and he cites as an
example the iroquois belief in the cannibal ghost

as the time of this story is about  or after
the shawneee had been driven to the ohio the
superstitious fears of the white traders are plausible
the execution of witches in new england was less
than forty years away in speaking of another
myth of the cherokee mr moony says the faith
in the existence of the miraculous littie deer is
almost as strong and universal to-day - ed
myths of the cherokee among the older chero-
kee as is the belief in a future life on commenting
on the talismanic power attached to the conse-
crated down of the young antler of the deer the same
author remarks so firm was the belief that it had
influence over anything about a deer that eighty or
a hundred years ago even white traders used to bar-
gain with the indians for such charms in order to in-
crease their store of deerskins by drawing trade to
themselves i cite this to prove readiness of
whites to accept indian beliefs

  the raven dives while flying by folding one
wing close to the body falling and says moony
apparently turning a somersault the cry given
at such times is described as being entirely different
from the ordinary cry of the raven

the old stage route between knoxville and
harpers ferry practically followed the great
indian war trail the cherokee and other in-
dians generally believed they would become what
they ate

  usunhiyi-where it is always growing dark is
used in myths and sacred formulas to denote the
west the land of the dead or ghost country
is situated in usunhiyi it is called tsusginai
the common word for west is wudeligunyi-there
where it the sun goes down

  it is told by the cherokee that in  two mo-
hawks killed more than twenty in stealthy attacks
on the lower towns during the spring and
summer their adroit ambuscades caused the chero-
kee to believe they were wizards or witches-hugh

  la lava kilometro - salvador c a

  dear friend tuttle your very welcome and
interesting letter came in yesterday i will try to
make this a connected letter old-timer but cant say
that i shall i ate a lot of cucumbers yesterday and
for a wonder that old stomach of mine reniged i
can generally eat anything that is too thick to drink
or drink anything that is too thin to eat but this
time it failed i got a tummy-ache and then
thought i would cure it by taking a good shot of
hootch i dont yet know if it was the cucumber
salad or the hootch that put me on the blink but
naiurally i lay it to the former anyway i hap-
pened to be down at a town named sonsonate
pretty nearly like cincinnati eh and was staying
at a hotel  sure passed a hi-yu night of it griping
with what resembled a cross between a baby
with the colic and a full-grown hombre with the
ptomaine poison but i dug myself out in time for
the first train this morning and arrived here on the
job and found out that one of my engineers had
stolen my hand-car last night and had taken a
bunch to a nearby town and got them all hi-yu
dnink and they had a fight with machetes on the
way back and disabled several and what was worse
broke my hand-car oh this life in the tropics is

m ovv ill go back to the start and tell you the
news i think i told you that after i had vol-
unteered for relief work and had done quite a bit of
that after the earthquake i felt the pressing need
of a few simoleons about that time the red cross
asked me to construct their building for them at my
own price  told them that i had no money to offer
for red cross work but that if they would buy the
material and pay for the labor i would do the con-
struction for them donating my work instead of
money as the officers of the red cross knew that
i was broke they mentioned this offer frequently so
i got quite a rep

  then i began to get offers at good prices in con-
struction work i started in that business and took
in a partner who had almost as much money as i
had but who was a good hustler i began to make
money but i had to work old top i worked lit-
erally day and night many a night i spent ma-
king elevations and setting my blue prints for the
morning sun and then spent the entire day in man-
aging my gangs of men and wondering where i
would land the money for the pay-roll that week
but i got the reputation and the business i en-
close one of my cards

uhile i was at this business the railway whose
letter-heads i am now using phoned me and
asked me to come down to see them i replied that
i was too busy the general manager then came
down to see me and wanted me to take charge of a
certain job for them i told them that as it would
take me out of the city i could not do the work for
them-if they could get any one else they tried
and then they asked me to at least go down and see
the work and give them a report on what i thought
of it they to pay any sum that i demanded for my
time so consumed and all expenses for the trip i
agreed to that if the trip would not occupy more
than three days of my time

and here was the job when the volcano broke
loose it opened several new craters an im-
mense flow of lava from one of these ran down and
covered a portion of the railroad about a mile and
a half long to a depth of from eighteen to thirty feet
of hot lava the right-of-way troubles etc allow
them to occupy only their old right of way in
other words the job was to build a railroad over hot
lava-a stunt never before pulled off in the history
of mankind well i have never seen a job that
scared me i walked across the lava over the pro-
posed route i smothered in sulfur fumes i ran
over white-hot rocks and sprinted through blue
flames i felt the crust give under my feet and
jumped for other points which also gave way-for
all i knew into an infemo of molten rock below
but i went back and told them the road could be
put across in three months they then wanted to
know if i would take the job i told them i would
not on contract but that i would do it for them if
they would pay all expenses and for my superinten-
dence would pay me a certain sum per week
they snapped at it so there you are im the en-
gineer in charge of this work and am making good
instead of getting across in three months i will
make it in between six and seven weeks

fid you ever see lava hot lava especially

   it does not look like i had supposed when it
first comes from the crater it appears to be a mass of
flames at that time it is of course in a molten
state but it partially solidifies rapidly then the
pressure behind breaks up this partially solid rock
and rolls and tumbles it forward in a rugged mass
which might be likened to a badly plowed field of
some mythological giant portions stay boiling and
spout out flames and sulfurous smoke like miniature
volcanoes other parts partly cool but have no
grain like natural rock or granite

t have had my troubles no one knew any-
thing about such a job i had to go it blindly
the only way i have succeeded is because i know
how to work the people i know their language
their viewpoint the arguments that get under their
skin i know when to be severe with them and when
to treat them in a patriarchal or better said a feudal
manner in other words i get harmony of action
from the five to six hundred laborers and thirty to
forty employees i am using i will succeed but
the troubles have been many i have run across
rock so hard that it would turn the finest chisels
it was so hot i could not use dynamite it would
burn up before even the shortest possible fuse
could reach the cap using a chisel for fifteen or
twenty minutes it would begin to glow dull red
lose its temper and double over under the blows like
a piece of iron just taken from the forge the rock
was so hot that the men could stand on it for only a
short time per trick at one time i had gangs
shoveling white-hot stone their shovels wrapped in
blue flame and the bed of lava thundering and
cracking under their feet it is a job the like of
which will probably never be seen again

   anyway i have gotten the line over about half-
way already and when the general manager and his
staff came down last saturday and looked it over
they told me they were more than satisfied and inti-
mated if i went ahead the way i was going that
there might be a substantial bonus in it for me at the
end i wonder what will happen this time to break
adventure



me again if i ever gel any money and live to
spend it i think the shock will probably kill me

well that is enough of my vicissitudes i was
tickled to bear that your honeymoon had
passed so gloriously and i hope that the rest of
your lives will be only a continuation of the honey-
moon i dont blame you at all for raving a bit
over your wife you have ample reason to do so
if an ornery sour-dough artist who admits beginning
to get bald-headed can get a wife like that i wonder
what a good-looking fellow like myself might do
and i can tell you from experience friend o mine
youll never meet up with the good times in other
parts that you enjoy in your own teepee i often
wish that my life had been laid in different lines but
-well there is no use bewailing the mandates of kis-
met i am doomed like the wandering jew to ktep
always on the move and suppose i shall eventually
kick in like a desert rat-with my shoes on if i own
any and glorying in the life ive led even if repent-
ing the death i die anyway i know that when i do
kick in i will have lived im a bit like the old-
timer who had soused up with hootch for years and
was finally told by the doctor that he would have to
quit drinking or go blind his reply was yval
derncd ef i haint seen nigh all th world i want to
see anyhow

i dont get much war news down here i used

  to when i was in the legation but here it is
scarce i want to get into that scrap but ive got
to get a few ducats together first for my two sons
in the states from all indications i will have all
kinds of time to get into it yet although i am get-
ting past the age i did not think i would have
great trouble getting into it for i believe i told you
that i am an ex-regular soldier from spanish-ameri-
can war times in fact i am a member of the post
of spanish-american war veterans in everett
washington where i resided for a time a few years
ago i think i told you about that did i not

  must end this for a time and do some work

  here is the later letter

san salvador el salvadore c a

  have tried to die of black-water fever-the most
pernicious of fevers-worse than the yellow jack
then i had amoebic dysentery but i finished the
job if i had given up i might have saved my
health but i am bull-headed i am now on my feet
again and shall probably go at once to guatemala
city at the request of president estrada cabrera
to take charge of the reconstruction of that city
dont know how i happened to not be in that
earthquake

jyfy illness left me broke again i made a
few thousand out of the job and finished in six
weeks the company treated me all right but
doctors nurses hotels and special diet got it all
i knew i couldnt live to really enjoy all that
coin

  but i shall be in the stales soon-along in the
spring if i am flush look for me if i am broke
well i may hit the back door for a handout

  wont write much as i have an engagement in
about an hour which means some filthy lucre and i
am pretty weak and nervous yet will write again
very soon and give my address-brandon

a word from one of our comrades on
the french front and i wonder how
many of us altogether are over there doing
their bit heres our good luck to our
comrade who writes us and to all the
others

somewhere in france

  when we arrived in this country it was sure cold
and it rained or snowed pretty near all of the time
which made it worse when the weather got a
little warmer we were greeted by mud it was
mud with a capital m for every step we would
take we had to be careful so it wouldnt pull our
boots off it stuck so but now we cant complain
were having real warm weather and most of the
mud is dried up

pritzie gets real fresh sometimes and throws
some shells over but he quiets down quick
when the sammies start shooting back at him
fritaie dont like to taste his own medicine

  ive seen a couple of air fights and believe me
its interesting and exciting the way those
aviators can handle their machines is simply won-
derful when i read about them i used to think
it was impossible but now ive seen for myself
a german machine was brought down not far from
here the other day and if you could have seen how
quick the boys stripped it of souvenirs youd have
laughed

  when the anti-aircraft guns start banging away
we uke to see where the shells break it looks as if
little puffs of smoke were following the aeroplane
but it really is the shells breaking i like to stand
and watch how close the shells land i think its a
lucky shot that can bring one down-gustave

today comes news that two more
of our writers brigade have joined the
colors dr j u giesy having made
attempt after attempt and undergoing an
operation in order to meet physical require-
ments writes me joyfully that he has at
last been commissioned in the medical
corps of the united states army and
from europe comes a post-card saying
greeting to adventure from somewhere
in france-george rothwell brown

t had a recent letter from our com-
rade harold s lovett the marine
who was on ii m s agamemnon at the
dardanelles but this letter was post-
marked at new york a previous letter
which is coming to you at one of our camp-
fires had told me he was now gunner on a
merchant ship with one u-boat credited to
his marksmanship the other day he ap-
peared in person and we had a good visit
together and i hope to be seeing him when-
ever hes in port

plantations and trading in the south seas

  question-i am interested in the south-sea
islands but do not know an iota about the subject
i would like to know how much money it would take
to go into the plantation business how much profit
could be made based on capital invested and what is
raised on the plantations about trading what
do you trade and for what do you trade it to the
natives can you give me a list of books or
pamphlets which i could get on the subject-
charles gavelda clarksburg w va

  answer by mr mills-works that would be of
any practical help on the south seas are scarce and
expensive and are published in england i can not
give you a list of books on the subject available in
u s a your public libraries might help in this
direction after the war if you apply to any of the
steamship lines trading into the south seas they
will furnish you with guide-books which contain
some information the censor restricts the issue
of such books naturally just now

  the amount of money needed to start as a planter
in the islands is also one which i can not do justice
to it is all a matter of personal equation-how
large your ambition may be and the strength of your
banking account a man with money and enter-
prise and energy-and all are certainly needed in the
islands-should certainly give the ground a good
look over before he invests no earthly good taking
my word for it who am i that any man should

leave his home-land and invest his capital for me

  almost anything can be raised in the islands but
-as you will see by some of the notes i have already
sent to the ask adventure pages-there are so
many groups and all have their specialty therefore
a definite direction upon your generalizing proposi-
tion is out of the question if america and austra-
lasia plus japan and britain insist that none of the
south-sea islands shall go back to germany then
we shall see great developments in the islands
cotton for instance now almost unknown there
will become a staple product

  at the present time the planters merely take off
the surface what bounteous nature gives with al-
most no effort-copra the kernel of the coconut
from which a valuable soap-making oil is extracted
bananas which are shipped to australia and new
zealand oranges rubber is a developing indus-
try in papua which the australians captured
from the germans gold has been found and the
australian government is now prospecting for oil

  the islands are on the equator therefore hot
the natives generally are friendly toward the white
man and native labor is employed on the planta-
tions a good well-kept plantation of any sort of
product is a profitable investment but experience is
needed if a man owned a small vessel he could
trade among the islands and buy from the natives
or planters the difference between the planter
and the trader is that one grows and the other buys
for the outside market

hunting and fishing in arizona

  question-i am planning a limited hunting trip
to the country lying north of tucson arizona
being raised east of the mississippi river am ignor-
ant of conditions outside of the arizona cities i
expect to leave home in a party of three or four with
a winchester  repeating rifle for my own use
we expect to go in a ford touring car and be gone for
about two weeks what kind of game will i find
and what kind may i expect to kill with a  caliber
rifle what kind of game will the law allow me to
kill during the months of april may june july
and august what will a chcap but convenient
camping outfit cost a party of three or four and what
kind should we get what kind of food should we
carry and how much what precautions should we
take against animals and reptiles at night what
would be the farthest point we may expect to reach
and return under ordinary conditions traveling
say three hours a day where may game and fish
be found most plentiful in this region-h b
robinson tucson arizona

  answer by mr harriman-according to arizona
law you are not to kill any game in april and may
you can shoot doves and white wings after june st
there you are and a mighty small bag of game you
will get

  get your camp-stuff prices where you are as they
differ from los angeles prices

  consult some of the old-timers in tucson-there
are plenty of them-and your own appetite plus the
food administration rules about what to take in the
way of grub my habit has been to pack bacon
flour rice sugar salt baking powder canned toma-
toes and canned milk

  personally i would not expect to get any fishing
till after i had gone well north of florence in the
gila mountains you have desert all the way from
tucson to florence and beyond if i were in tuc-
son and had a desire to fish and hunt i would
chase up to roosevelt dam and fish in the reservoir
or salt river or tonto creek trout season does
not begin till june first other fish september first

  all the protection i want against animals is to
have my gun handy i dont know what animals
would harm you anyhow since they are all far
more afraid of you than you are of them as for
reptiles a tent with canvas bottom sewed in and
turned up across entrance to height of ten inches is
plenty b h dyas - west th street los
angeles sells a water-proof tanolite tent like that
write him for prices

  the distance you would travel in three hours in a
ford is dependent on roads and accidents cant
tell you that

maine fishing

  question-will you let me know the possibility
of bay and surf fishing either by casting or from a
small boat or motor-launch kind of fishing to be
had in what quantity they run tackle necessary
bungalows or cottages that may be rented or board
secured weather conditions or clothes necessary
transportation methods and costs accessibility of
guides and their cost are licenses necessary for
salt-water fishing-henry m goldstein new
york city

  answer by dr hathome-i am not as well
posted on the bay and surf fishing on the coast of
maine as on the inland stream and lake fishing

i think there is very little if any surf fishing but
thereare plenty of fish to be had in the bays and off
the coast

  they catch great quantities of cod haddock pol-
lock hake in the deep water and in the bays
flounders cunners mackerel etc

  several years ago i made a number of trips to
small point which is situated some fifteen miles
below the city of bath at the mouth of the kenne-
bec river for tautog fishing or black fish as some
call them this was good sport the best i think 
ever had for salt-water fishing

  there are plenty of cottages to be had which can
be rented from one week to the whole season and
the prices run from si per day up board in pri-
vate families and hotels ranges from  per week
upwards fishing tackle may be had from any of
the small towns along the coast and the outfit is not
expensive

  launches and guides may be had at very reason-
able prices

  transportation facilities are good as most of the
resorts can be reached by railroad or steamship
lines

  licenses are not required for salt-water fishing

trading in central africa

  question-will you tell me what chances an ex-
army man has in the trading business in central
africa i am in the army at the present time but
would like to hunt up something when i get out i
am twenty-two years old and have had a little ex-
perience as trader in mexico i ran a small store
for the american mining syndicate two years in
n w sonora i have only a common school edu-
cation but a strong constitution i am a good
photographer and can run a moving-picture camera
will you give me the address of a couple of the
trading companies that i could write to regarding a
position as sub-agent in one of the interior stations
what would be the duties of a sub-agent-sgt e

pany surrey house victoria embankment lon-

  state age and experience

  i think you ought to make it especially if you can
keep accounts the pay is not attractive at first
but a likely young fellow will come out all right
of course these companies are going to think twice
before they hire a stranger they have never seen
and by far your best chance is to work passage to
liverpool and go round the offices write for ap-
pointment when in liverpool

  several of my correspondents however have se-
cured jobs with above-named firms by simply writ-
ing conditions however will be very different
when the big armies are disbanded there will be
many thousands looking for such berths

  the duties of a sub-agent cover such help as he
can give the agent in clearing the stem-wheelers
and freight canoes that bring goods from port and
ask adventure	

take back the rubber palm kernels etc and helping
in the barter store writing up the ledgers until the

geology in tennessee

  question-i am very much interested in the
study of plant life geology and mineralogy and am
contemplating a trip if i can find a suitable place
arc there any veins of silver lead or gold within the
boundaries of tennessee that have not already been
worked in the study of geology i delight in the
exploration of caves and climbing steep cliffs if
there is anything in tennessee worth while could
you inform me-h carl marmon tennessee
city tenn

  answer by mr liebe-as to minerals i do not
actually know of any veins of silver lead or gold
within this state that have not been worked
every now and then some native of these hills back
here thinks he has found something valuable but
it has always so far as i know turned out to be
something else however heres something ill
tell you for what it may be worth

  there used to be an iron furnace at embreeville
some  miles from here in the hills this outfit is
now digging zinc and i understand in great
quantities one of their men told me last summer
that there was lead in the neighborhood of the zinc
mines his name is gudger stewart you might
write him

  in regard to exploring caverns and climbing
steep cliffs-you should find plenty of that sort of
thing notably steep cliffs between here and cran-
berry n c a distance of  mile also the new
c c  o railway which passes through here can
show you some great stuff in the mountains back
of teuico plains which is at the end of a short rail-
road running back from athens this state you will
find wonders-also if you arent careful some moon-
shiners that were real bad when i knew them the
noted clingmans dome and ho knob are in this
section

summer cruises in canada

  question-on the map one can go up the
maniconagun river to lake kaniatichan north
branch of the lake curves south and according to
scale comes within tvvleve miles of the center branch
of the big river big river rims west into james
bay the abitibi connects james bay with abi-
tibi lake which is again touched by g t p ry
is it feasible to make this trip by canoe is a
portage of the length indicated feasible in that
country how long would trip take going along
easily without loafing and without paddling your
arms out what would be a reasonable cost
would one guide be enough is canoe and other
equipment obtainable from guide how late in
the fall could i start and taking things easy get out
before waters freeze up-o s griffith phila-
delphia pa

  answer by mr sangster-of your listed queries
all rest on the first and second i would hardly care
to advise the cruise over the waters you indicate
inasmuch as the trip is one that is hardly practical
and the map details without doubt are absolutely
estimated and inaccurate

  the abitibi route is of course one of the most
used so-called james bay routes of all person-
ally i would not recommend a trip over any from
the standpoint of comfort scenery game etc its
too much hard work too much oling and portaging
and there is little at the northern end from a scenic
standpoint

  far better are the cruising waters contiguous to
the height of land watershed in a far superior
scenic region with far better fishing and in a region
showing far more game of all kinds the main wild-
life seen on the james bay end is wild-fowl and geese

  following are two suggested three or four week
cruises that i would much prefer for an all-round
canoe trip combining a-l fishing fine scenery
enough white water to satiate any reasonable fel-
low and the sight of all kinds of moose and other
life-viz

  	from amos on the transcontinental line
 miles east of cochrane in n w quebec south
through the harricanaw head-waters-the harri-
canaw also runs through to james bay-thence over
the famous ottawa portage into the upper
ottawa river and down it some  or  miles-
affording some exciling white stuff and fine fish-
ing-to the outlet of the kenojevis river turning
up this river some  miles and thence through the
kiekiek lakes stretch out on big kewagana lake
and continuing through to seals nome lake again
back to amos on a -day trip in august ill
venture you could see from  to  or even more
moose as well as beaver otter fox lynx and all
kinds of black duck etc fishing a-l

  	from obrien  miles west of amos
south through lois lake and over the two new
salmon and trout lakes lying on the height of
land crossing into the kenojevis and down through
its waters going through the upper ottawa lakes
and river coming out at ville marie or haileybury-
a splendid -day trip in august affording sight of
moose etc and a-l fishing

   for either of these trips i can undertake to arrange
for a capable guide canoe and everything but your
personal clothing and fishing tackle at a definite cost
for either  or  days

  august will afford best chances to see most game
but september affords the open hunting season

betel-nut

  question-i have seen lots of items about the
betel-nut and wonderful results obtained from its
use do you know anything about it can you
give me the address of a man from whom i can pro-
cure some i understand that betel-nut enables
one to undergo great fatigue-c b ramsey
sandidges va

  answer by captain dingle-the betel-nut is
simply the nut of a climbing pepper it is grown
mostly in the malay states and islands adjacent
and india the nut itself is about the size of a
hazelnut though it grows in a membranous cover-
ing as big as a small potato the people who chew
this stuff cut the nut into pieces wrap a piece in
lime and the leaf of the betel and then chew it as
for tremendous stamina-giving properties i dont
know of them the habit stains lips and mouth a
glaring red color but preserves the teeth and im-
parts a more or less pleasant odor to the breath

  perhaps the herb you are thinking of is the coco
that is grown in south and central americas and
adventure

iyo

the coco leaf chewed does give wonderful vitality
and staying power it is of course the base of
cocaine and habitual use has almost as evil an
effect as the drug itself in chewing this leaf the
south american native uses ashes or lime with it
just as the malay does with his betel this hastens
the extraction of the juices

  the only thing i can suggest is that you write to
some big importers either south american or east
indian and ask them if they can supply small
quantities you might get the coco leaves at a
good drug-store but i dont think youll get the
betel that way a very good firm to try for the
coco is w r grace hanover square new york
but as these people are simply large merchants and
conduct no small business perhaps they would not
bother with a small order but i think they would
at least inform you where these herbs can be got i
have personally secured small parcels of coco locally
but it was before the war and since that i have been
unable ever to get any that is the reason i can
not tell you more satisfactorily where you may get
the stuff

  to wind up perfectly candidly i dont advise you
to acquire either of these habits if you propose
going on tremendously fatiguing expeditions in the
andes or in south america generally you will
find in such places that the guides or natives can
supply you with all the coco you need both of
these things are very well in their place they are
simply dope though and as such should not be
fooled with

 chances in upper congo and uganda

  question-kindly inform me of the opportuni-
ties and adventures offered in the upper congo and
uganda to a healthy young man of twenty-two years
of age with steamship and clerical experience
would be willing to go in at anything if i could get
the right opportunity or adventure-james g
valcos guantanamo bay cuba

  answer by mr beadle-in the upper congo
and uganda there is elephant and big-game shooting
generally but small opportunities except for trad-
ing for which you would require considerable capi-
tal as well as experience most of the white men
there are in government service mining or rubber
and obviously your clerical and steamship experi-
ence would be of little value there nearly all cleri-
cal work is done by goanese and indians the
rhodesias have plenty of openings in agriculture
and mining but again your experience is of no par-
ticular value there

  your best chance to get in would be with one of
the many firms trading on the west coast where
your steamship life would be an asset

  i do not even mention the transvaal as i take it
that you want to get a job with some chance of
adventure attached

the effect of the tropics

  question-i read in adventure about the sun
and other things getting a white man in africa
is this condition temporary or permanent would
a three-years stay in africa so reduce the blood that
you could not stand cold climates such as canada
and alaska again-thomas l coate new york

  answer by mr miller-three years in the
tropics should not effect any permanent physical in-

jury one soon reacclimatizes canned foods and
the heat enervate one and thin the blood but one
soon recovers back home the worst effect is not
physiological but psychological after the lazy life
and freedom of the tropics it is hard for one to settle
back into the humdrum and commonplace hard to
return to regular employment to punching a time-
clock or sitting at a typewriter or clerking but
that is an individual matter of will and ambition

  there are just now no direct steamship lines from
america to the congo you would have to reach
west africa via liverpool southampton hamburg
or havre in peace times though just now the
elder dempster steamship co and the west
african line the ports of call en route are fun-
chal madeira las palmas the grand canaries
monrovia the capital of liberia and such gold
coast ports as the freight and passengers call for

a trip in the canal zone

  question-a party of four wish to take a trip
up the segovia river in honduras next november
with the idea of prospecting for gold we wish to
obtain information as to camp equipment supplies
if carriers can be hired and if trade goods are in-
cluded if conditions will permit we thought of
staying in the interior for twelve or fourteen months
where can i obtain literature on metallurgy
what part of the canal zone would you advise for
prospecting for gold where are the moon or
canal stones found-are they deep within the earth
or on surface-edward a mcmahon pedro
miguel c z

  answer by mr young-my suggestion would
be to go to corinto on the pacific side and then go
by rail to leon or some other city on the railroad
and then strike out and go overland from there to
the headwaters of the river getting up the segovia
is a difficult matter it is much easier to come
down without you have your own boat you will
find the native prices very high asking as much as
eighty-eight dollars per ton to transport freight half-
way up the river there are several english and
american owned mines in the western half of nica-
ragua and honduras where you could get a look at
the native ores first hand the san juancito mine
in honduras has produced about twenty million
dollars in gold up to the present time

  as far as placer mining is concerned you can get
any prospector to show you how it is done in a few
minutes call on mr c w northrop in the dis-
patchers office of the panama railroad at ancon
canal zone and ask him to tell you about the na-
tive ores and how to look for placer mines get him
to introduce you to a native cholo who has pros-
pected for him mr northrop is an old friend of
mine and will do anything he can for you if you tell
him that i sent you get him to suggest a good book
on metallurgy or better yet get him to loan you one

  there is gold up the gatuncillo river from gatun
i knew five men who went up there and made wages
with a sluice box in  but i can not say whether
the lake has covered up this ground or not

  the moon or canal stones you speak of were
found in the gravel pumped from the bed of the
chagres river there was a pile of this gravel near
gorgona which is now under water i am sure
which contained chucks of this stone get hold of
mr freehan a depot agent at corozal or some
other station on panama railroad he isan expert
ask adventure

on stones of this kind and he and i have picked
up many a stone along the canal i feel sure he can
tell you where some are to be found around there
right now

  get hold of mr e r brewer by asking the
panama railroad officials and get him to tell you
how to prepare for a trip on foot through the
jungles and best of all get him to show you how to
roll a blanket-roe into an overalls pack

bois blanc island michigan

  question-will you kindly let me know what
you can about bois blanc island in upper michi-
gan as regards residence climate hunting fishing
automobile laws estimated valuation of the land
etc-thomas c kurtz pittsburgh pa

  answer by mr spears-bois blanc island in
northwestern lake huron possesses delightful
great lake climate in summer cool comfortable
with occasional warm days-probably ninety de-
grees write weather bureau washington d c
for reports covering weather and climate winters
hard grim snow and cold and communication often
interrupted with mainland by ice and storms
after november first bad weather-winds gales
rain and snow lake fishing is excellent fine motor-
boating but i question motoring as a pastime

  as for real-estate values write to postmaster
bois blanc mackinac county michigan and ask
for addresses of real-estate dealers but on this
point you could check up prices asked by writing to
county clerk of mackinac county at st ignace
michigan for information about assessed values-
probably much under market values the post-
master at bois blanc could probably give you some
idea of values himself also some idea of the game
detroit and cleveland navigation company de-
troit michigan for steamer folders and connections

  these michigan and huron islands are largely
occupied by fishermen and rafters with some sum-
mer population as at mackinac island and i be-
lieve much fewer on bois blanc i believe too
that there are a few indians on bois blanc but am
not sure the postmaster would tell you the popula-
tion and the local business which will very likely in-
clude some stock-raising and farming as well as fish-
ing rafting wrecking or towing

  the state historical society lansing michigan
would doubtless refer you to published descriptive
matter covering this island of recent date-maga-
zine articles etc covering some of the features you
inquire about

australian bushmen

  question-i am very much interested in the aus-
tralian bushman and his customs i understand
that the older men of the tribes form clubs and treat
the younger ones very badly is this so please
give me any information available as regards cus-
toms manners and location-e d wagner
montgomery city mo

  answer by mr goldie-what you know as the
australian bushman is a species of tramp who
plods his way through the endless miles of the back
country of australia lazing his life away and work-
ing only at occasional small jobs on farms or sheep
stations the term bushman is also used to
designate the real workers of the bush country but
i judge from your letter that you refer to those of

iyi

the order of tramps who otherwise known as swag-
mcn and sundowners have become a very
strange and interesting fraternity

  far from being of the hobo class known in this
country the bush tramp of australia is often well
educated and honest though naturally there are
many who would answer to a poorer description
the swagman as he is generally known because
he always carries a swag comprising his few per-
sonal needs rolled up in a blanket and swung across
his shoulder is well treated by the farming classes
because he often comes in useful to perform small
chores and to meet the demand for labor at the har-
vesting or shearing seasons

  it is customary to allow him a certain quantity of
flour and tea even though he does no work for it and
on this allowance he chiefly lives making for him-
self a rough kind of bread known as damper and
stewing his tea in a billycan which he always carries

  following the wallaby track as the long bush
trail is popularly called is said by many to be a
most fascinating occupation for those who have no
ties and who have tired of city life i met a gov-
ernment official in london once who told me that
he had done many adventurous things in life
but nothing called to him so insistently as the aus-
tralia bush where in sunshine and silence he had
found himself drawn closer to nature than any-
where else he had been

  you refer in your letter to tribes i wonder if
you mean the blacks if so i must tell you that the
australian aborigines have almost died out and ex-
cepting in parts of northern and central australia
which are otherwise uninhabited are rarely encoun-
tered in their original tribal state i know of no
such custom as you suggest a great mistake is
made by many people in thinking of australian
bushmen as blacks whereas in point of fact austra-
lia is one of the whitest countries in the world
the few blacks that arc left are of the lowest order
of humanity have few tribal customs left and are
dying out so rapidly thet they will soon be entirely
extinct

wintering in british columbia

  question-my pal and i wish to spend a winter
some place in the northwest and have about de-
cided upon british columbia can you tell us of a
place where the hunting and fishing are good how
are the chances for prospecting how about the
customs regulations-would it be better to buy an
outfit there-edward d cook jr u s s
louisiana

  answer by mr carson-the cariboo district
seems to be about what you fellows are looking for
there is plenty of game there a fair amount of fur
good fishing and a chance to prospect with a reason-
able hope of success

  get your outfit there where you will have some
one to advise you as to what you need it is impos-
sible for any one to tell another man just what he
will want as you are aware tastes differ especially
as to what is really necessary for comfort you will
save all the trouble of transportation and customs
while the price will be about the same

  with regard to the customs regulations you can
take in outfit by depositing with the collector of
customs an amount equal to the duty which would
be paid otherwise if you return within six months
and have your stuh identified this will be refunded
to you

french women to the rescue

when the black cloud of war broke over
the fair plains of artois all france with its
heritage of dread fell instantly to work to make
every individual and every resource count
food was the womans problem

  since the days of the comtesse de rebenac
in mediasval times the women of france have
been famous for their excellence and thrift in
cooking

  as the years of war have swept on black
necessity has forced french housewives to the
utmost limit of their racial genius to conserve
the food

  now that america is entered in the life-and-
death struggle we too face the duty if not ne-
cessity of avoiding all waste in food

  under these circumstances what more ser-
viceable thing could be done than to set before
the women of america the advice of their
noble sisters of france born of their tragic
experience

  alone of all american publications the de-
lineator is in a position to do this for we pub-
lish and send to france monthly a french edi-

tion of the delineator le miroirdes modes
the largest and most influential magazine of its
kind in france

  we appealed to the readers of the french
delineator to tell their american sisters how
they are solving the food problem we asked
specifically for their best economical recipes
and hundreds of women in all sections of
france have answered our appeal

  these recipes as delicious as they are eco-
nomical are being given to american house-
wives each month in the delineator they
will prove a revelation each one has been suc-
cessfully tested by honore wilkie the editor

  for instance here is a recipe sent in by mme
louise bocquet of the french town of flers de
lorne it is a recipe for hindu biscuits given
her by a hindu officer billeted at her house
the ingredients are simply one ounce of flour
one ounce of butter one ounce of grated cheese

  the french recipes in one number alone will
save you many times the price of a years sub-
scription do not miss any issue of the delin-
eator it is a family necessity invest in it to-day
