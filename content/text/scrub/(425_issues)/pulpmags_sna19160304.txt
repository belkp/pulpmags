second march number

there are scores of famous authors whose names hold an honor-
able place in american literature but the humorous writers
can be numbered almost on the fingers of one hand it is an
editorial axiom that a humorous story is the hardest of all to get and
so in offering hugh kahlers the stronger sex the novelette that
will open this second march issue we feel that we have achieved
something on which we may especially pride ourselves the stronger
sex is one of the finest humorous stories we have ever read its
style is pointed without being cutting its humor clean and spontane-
ous without being forced or of the horse-play variety and its a real
story that holds you quite apart from its ability to tackle your risi-
bilities we are proud of this story we know youll enjoy it

     and then as an offset to this tale in lighter vein we have some of
the finest and strongest short stories we have ever published for
instance a knowledge of life by walter a roberts is a vivid
story of the sudent life that in happier days centred about the boul
mich and montparnasse tragic perhaps for all life is made up of
either comedy or tragedy but with a real lesson and a real warning

     this is my wife by rex t stout is an especially strong story
of cabaret life in new york and the second confession of a fashiona-
ble practitioner is as startlingly original a story as we have ever
ventured on

     again we have to congratulate ourselves upon a new author hugh
kent who makes his first appearance in any american magazine with
the little story woman-fear a most intimate and appealing study
of the fears and hopes the joys and sorrows of a young bride while
the blind heart by andrew soutar is a worthy sequel to his other
stories the law and the safe

     among the other short stories that we think you will especially
enjoy we might mention quid pro quo by tarleton collier the
girl from arle by dale drummond a dream fulfilled by harold
de polo things by ruth wright kauffman and nothing but the
truth by harold vickers  while the one-act play so popular a feature
of snappy stories is this time from the pen of w d hepen-
stall and carries the engaging title of masks

     alias mrs jessop comes to a whirlwind finish in this issue and
there will also be some poetry of the sort that has made snappy
stories famous

    a novelette
    by jack rowes

i

dusk was falling across the
water beyond the two darken-
ing headlands guarding the
golden gate the sinking sun flung its
avalanche of color-crimson violet
gold melting into tender turquoise
where the outer edges wedded deeper
blue over the rippling stretch of in-
coming tide amethystine shadows flick-
ered through the golden mist along the
shores of the exposition lights were al-
ready winking from the buildings while
in the busy zone the entrances to the
palaces of amusement shone with the
weird hopelessness of electricity at-
tempting to rival the natural light of de-
clining day

  tired sightseers hurrying homeward
for dinner drew their wraps more
closely in anticipation of the chill breeze
which springs up along the californian
coast after sundown down the avenue
of palms past the ever gushing foun-
tain of energy out through the main en-
trance of the exposition they poured
pausing to glance back at the majestic
tower of jewels quivering and scintil-
lating with blinding iridescence under the
ardent caresses of the sunset glow

  down at the other end of the grounds
a girl leaned against a corinthian column
as she feasted her eyes on the most per-
fect piece of architecture in the inclo-
sure the graceful temple of the palace
of fine arts now bathed in a pinkish
blush by the afterglow her slim figure
in its gown of deep mourning strikingly
outlined against the pale turquoise
fluted pillar her chestnut hair a vivid
gold in that same glow her eyes mys-

terious black-shadowed under heavy-
fringed lids the unconscious pathos of
her pose-all made a picture so unique
that ransom fuller turned in the
shadow of the peristyle and concealed
behind one of the huge ornamental urns
took in the details in appreciative enjoy-
ment he was not a man to let any ob-
ject that attracted him escape him and
this young creature with her creamy
pallor her magnificent dark dreamy
eyes and crimson flower-crushed mouth
was the most exquisite thing he had ever
seen in this land of natures beauties and
lovely women

  the afterglow faded and to the right
the top of the tower of jewels flashed
into sudden light as the electrifying of
the huge creamy-tinted buildings began
but still the girl lingered and still the
tip of ransom fullers cigar glowed
through the gathering dusk neither he
nor the girl saw two figures gliding
along the peristyle not until steps fell
on the tiled flooring beside her was she
conscious of any other visitors at that
point in the open corridor nor did she
turn her head when one of the men
halted beside her and gazed stealthily
at her profile

  this the one youre sure bill
the whisper to the man behind was
answered by a nod after a brief
glance about in which he failed to dis-
cover the half-concealed form of fuller
the man beside the girl put his hand into
his pocket and immediately something
metallic silvery gleamed in his fingers
there was a quickly stifled cry from the
girl as the needle plunged home then
she reeled choking gasping into his




the dragons ci-aw

grasp the columns of pale turquoise
and faintly tinted terra-cotta seemed to
crash down in an avalanche of cosmic
chaos a deathly faintness gripped her
then-silence

  her body relaxed the two men
quiet well-groomed good-looking car-
ried her towards the entrance where
one of the electrically propelled chairs
built for two passengers awaited them
as they brought her out a small crowd
of belated sightseers gathered around

  a ladys fainted    some ones
been taken sick    what a lovely
girl the murmurs grew as they
caught sight of the ruddy hair and death-
pale features

  a brown-uniformed policeman push-
ed his way through the gaping loiterers

  whats the trouble he questioned

  the younger of the two men turned
impatiently with an anxious glance at
the girl

  my sister he explained rapidly
she fainted as we were walking
through the peristyle of the art palace
shes liable to these attacks nothing
dangerous-just a little weakness of the
heart ill get her home as quick as
possible here you-as the man in
charge of the conveyance waited-
wheel that chair up here and help me
lift her in    now then if youll be
kind enough to disperse this crowd-

  a greenback crackled ingratiatingly
the policeman drew back

   clear out all of yer he invited the
crowd impartially yer blockin the
traffic-

   whats this a tall athletic figure
shouldered its way through the mass
whats happened here

  ransom fuller glanced at the police-
man then at the recumbent figure of
the girl already lying back in the chair
the man at her side with one arm about
her placed his hand on the steering-gear

   get out of the way he snapped

   fuller came around to the girls side
of the vehicle one glance at her face

was enough it was she whom he had
watched in the peristyle the chair be-
gan to move even as he laid his hand
on her wrist

  stop he commanded as trenchantly
as the other this girl is ill-

  of course she is jeered the man
who had assisted to place the girl in the
chair and had then stepped back into
the crowd drive on jim dont mind
the mutt ill look in after dinner to
see how ella is

  fuller his hand on the girls limp
wrist found her pulse almost impercep-
tible

  theres something more than a mere
fainting fit here he said briefly his
keen gaze on her peculiar pallor

  let go of her hand commanded
the man beside her roughly youre
detaining me officer-he turned to
the policeman imperatively-clear this
place for me

  he pressed the button controlling the
power but his furtive nervousness
clenched fullers suspicions he leaned
over and jammed home the lever effect-
ively stopping the light machine

  the girls supposed brother turned a
livid face what are you trying to
do take your hands off this chair or
ill have you arrested

  with a quick movement fuller strip-
ped back the sheer black chiffon sleeve
covering the girls arm there plain
against its creamy texture was a tiny red
wound the man in the chair under-
standing fullers gesture gave a snarl
of rage

  my sister may die he bellowed
take this madman out of my way
bill here-

  his friend adroitly detaching himself
from the crowd appeared at his side
they exchanged quick covert glances
then bill  swung his fist at fullers
jaw but fuller was prepared before
the astonished officer could interfere he
put bill temporarily out of active par-
ticipation with a well-directed blow as
jack rowes



the machine started forward under the
impetus of the juice he turned to the
paralyzed official

  arrest this man he ordered tersely
ill run the chances of its being a mis-
take this girls in no faint shes
drugged thats a hypodermic punc-
ture

  with an oath the man leaned for-
ward

  none of that exclaimed fuller as
the fellow reached for his hip-pocket
there are too many witnesses for you
to make a get-away if you pull a gun

  appalled at the turn the incident was
taking the crowd fell back the police-
man at last gathered his scattered wits
and moved forward

  whats your game he growled to
fuller this here young man says
shes his sister-

  ill take the chances shes not re-
torted fuller arrest this man and
ill appear against him ill stake my
reputation on the fact that this girl has
been drugged im a physician-

  revolver in hand the man in the chair
leaped to the ground with one bound
but before he had cleared two steps the
density of the excited crowd impeded
him he struggled to free himself from
the hands outstretched to grasp him but
three amazed visitors from the east en-
joying this wild and woolly western
scene hung on until the officer roused
at last seized him from behind and dis-
armed him

  fuller then turned his attention to the
girl she lay as though already dead
with faint bluish shadows beneath her
long-fringed eyelids the doctor thrust
his hand into his pocket and produced a
card which he passed to the bewildered
officer

  heres my address  youll wrant me in
the morning he said quietly stepping
into the nearest seat beside the uncon-
scious girl im taking the young lady
to the inside inn because its the near-
est place about here and ive no idea

where she is stopping she ought to
have attention at once

  the officers brow cleared as he read
the engraving

ransom ogden fuller m d

office  grand avenue

los angeles cal

and penciled hastily in one comer
the inside inn exposition grounds
sorry to have held you up sir he
said pass on the chiefll communi-
cate with you in the morning

  producing handcuffs the policeman
deftly snapped them on his prisoner
the man threw fuller a baleful glance
then his face cleared as he saw that in
the excitement of his arrest his pal had
managed to make a clean get-away
things might have been worse he told
himself with chin ling wu at the
wheel surely the game was not lost
bill would make his report and the
boss would find a way out he re-
signed himself to sulky silence

  doctor fuller gave a quick glance
about then failing to find traces of the
vanished bill shrugged his broad
shoulders the crowd gave way as the
electric chair slowly forged ahead only
a short distance and the entrance to the
hotel gleamed invitingly brilliant

  as he stopped the light wicker ma-
chine the front door buttons hurried
out to receivc him the doctor was
gently removing the unconscious figure

come over on the other side of her
he ordered briefly shes in a faint
buttons sprang to attention and an
exclamation escaped him as he saw the
girls features

  my gawd its miss salisbury
what happened to her sir

  you know her shes staying
here the boy nodded then she s
had a little accident fuller added-all
the explanation he cared to have leak
out in the hotel

  great luck he muttered as he
helped to carry the girl up to her room
then sent for the chambermaid its


the dragons claw

fortunate that they recognized her ill
notify her family this raw attempt at
kidnaping will be something of a shock
to her relatives

  miss salisburys fainted he began
without any preliminaries as the maid
appeared where are the members of
her family who is with her

  the maid hesitated shes alone
sir i think shes been with one of the
parties that stop here to see the exposi-
tion but the others left to-day and she
told me she was goin to stay until an-
other party run by the same people
arrives here next week when shes to
join them an go on back east her
party only stayed here ten days an
she said she hadnt seen all she wanted
to she hadnt any relative or intimate
friends with her sir

  i see the doctor thought rapidly
evidently there was no relative to
notify of the extraordinary attempt at
kidnaping her mourning indicated
recent loss while her joining a party
for sight-seeing purposes pointed to the
probability of her being alone in the
world he crossed to the spacious
wardrobe trunk on it was the letter-
ing l s boston u s a

  some distance he mused as leav-
ing the maid in attendance he went to
his own room for a hypodermic syringe
an easterner traveling alone and a
beauty a tempting bait no doubt to
white-slavers on the lookout for vic-
tims

  the maid looking up saw the frown
on his brows as he reentered the cham-
ber during his absence she had un-
dressed miss salisbury and as the girl
lay supine in her dainty night lingerie
among the pillows her perfect physique
fired a spark of admiration which may
not have been wholly professional in
the physicians brilliant dark eyes
without question miss salisbury was
the finest specimen of youthful woman-
hood ever under his observation fuller
dismissed the maid then sat down his

black brows knit thoughtfully as he re-
garded the sleeping girl she looked so
young so strangely helpless as she lay
utterly relaxed the sheer lacy night-
robe low-necked and short-sleeved re-
vealing the sweet clear lines of creamy
neck and shoulders the rise and fall of
the perfectly modeled girlish breasts as
she drew each breath of tranced obliv-
ion

  what was she what mystery lay
behind those long dark-fringed eyelids
what secret tinged the life of this ex-
quisite young creature

  the girls intimate personal belong-
ings spoke of refined tastes with money
to gratify them the solid silver scat-
tered lavishly over the dressing-table
was of chaste design and bore the mark
of a silversmith of national reputation

  that a girl of her apparently comfort-
able circumstances should be traveling
alone unchaperoned puzzled the young
physician possibly she was married
perhaps even a widow mrs often
sounds like miss on servants lips
his glance darted to her hands the
left one was concealed beneath the
sheet her right within touch of his own
lay small appealing ringless

  he leaned over and mechanically
placed his fingers on the pulse it was
normal in its beat and her respirations
told him she had sunk into a natural
sleep one long strand of her unbound
hair lay in a coppery coil brushing his
hand as he withdrew it from her wrist
obeying an impulse he lifted it the
waving silken curls twining sheeny
tendrils about his fingers slipping linger-
ingly through as though loath to re-
lease him from the clinging caressing
touch a delicately evanescent perfume
like fresh crushed violets filled his
nostrils-that faintly suggestive scent of
the woman whose satiny skin is so se-
ductively sweet that the mere fragrance
is an unconscious temptation to men to
lose their heads

  before he realized what he was about
jack rowes



fuller found his face just above hers
his big dark eyes aglow  hungry -
looking eyes one of his patients-a
woman somewhat epris of the stunning
young physician-had called them with
no thought that his conduct was unbe-
coming his profession for the moment
he forgot his degree of md and re-
membered only that he was first of all
a man he wondered how those red
lips-for the natural color had returned
-would look if they should suddenly
break into a smile parted just a frac-
tion the glimmer of pearly enamel
gleamed through illusively enchanting
so near that his own breath mingled
with hers fuller came to his senses with
a start god he had almost kissed
her he had been on the point of per-
forming the most caddish act of his en-
tire professional career of deliberately
taking advantage of a patient who was
under his care

  with a hot flush on his tanned cheek
he wrenched his eyes away from the
mouth so like a crushed hibiscus bud
and looked down at the thick jetty eye-
lids they were open the eyes staring
straight up into his an exclamation
escaped him as he moved back

  the eyes into which he gazed as dark
as his own and tremendously enlarged
from the drug showed flecks of golden
flame in the iris as they looked at him
they dilated with surprise accustomed
to the usual lethargic condition of pa-
tients as the result of drug-poisoning
he leaned over her again holding her
startled gaze with his own as he said

  you must try to get some sleep
miss salisbury youve had a slight ill
turn and as i happened to be on hand
i brought you home im doctor fuller
of los angeles youll be all right in
the morning ill call in again then to
see how you are getting on he smiled
reassuringly

  wait i the hand near him groped
for a second and he took it up lightly
holding it in his own the warmly vi-

brant current of his magnetism seemed
to revive her a faint flush came into
her cheeks and the dreamy glaze in her
eyes cleared into sudden comprehension

   ive been ill but i cant re-
member anything-wait a moment-yes
i was standing in the peristyle looking
across the water i must have fainted
but ive never done such a thing in my
life what happened it seems to me
i remember feeling as though all those
pale blue and pink columns were falling
on my head-

  she stopped staring into space he
gently laid her hand back on the sheet

  you mustnt try to think or talk of
your illness to-night miss salisbury
youre out of the woods now and youll
feel quite yourself in the morning if
youll rest plenty of time then to tax
your memory if you think youd like
a night nurse to stay with you i can get
one for you within half an hour ill
stay with you until she arrives

  he rose in readiness to go to the house
telephone

  a nurse why am i ill enough
for that how odd i dont feel sick-
only swimmy and light-headed but
even thats better still if you think i
need a nurse of course you may call one
in wont you tell me what happened
im really quite strong and always so
well i know some accident must have
occurred did i fall it seems to me
i remember two men-

  she started up suddenly her eyes
staring straight ahead

  i do remember she cried vehement-
ly there were two men it all hap-
pened so quickly i scarcely saw them
but i felt a sharp prick on my arm-
she looked down at its pretty bare con-
tour on it the puncture still glowed
redly

  theres the mark she peered at it
triumphantly i felt a stab and then
two men seized me i remember re-
member-and then-i suppose i faint-
ed


the dragons claw

  she clasped her knees gazing up at
fuller wide-eyed do you know who
they were she questioned anxiously
he shook his head

  i havent the slightest idea miss
salisbury i hoped youd be able to
clear up that part of the mystery but
the police will find out theyve got one
of the men now safely under lock and
key wont you try to dismiss this
whole affair from your mind and get
the rest you so much need perhaps id
better call in that nurse-she may be
able to accomplish more in the line of
persuasion than i

  he paused again as she shook her
head

  do you think that if youd been the
one who had had knockout drops in-
jected into you-thats what they call it
isnt it  she appealed to him-youd be
willing to settle down calmly and go to
sleep without wanting to know the whole
truth about what had happened  i dont
believe you would you look like a
clever man-he flushed but she con-
tinued excitedly seeming oblivious of
the compliment she was paying him-
and im sure youd have enough natural
curiosity to try to find out who did such
a thing to you and why its such an
outrageous proceeding i cant think of
any one whod want to do such a despi-
cable thing i wonder if i should get
up and dress now and drive to the po-
lice-station would they let me see the
man who is locked up there

  she eyed him anxiously he smiled
as he crossed to the telephone

   i see youre not to be trusted alone
-he could not wholly keep the relieved
amusement from his voice-so im go-
ing to call in that nurse i shall tell the
agency to be sure to send me a strict
disciplinarian

please dont she called softly
really im not a bit ill my heads
just-queer-when i sit up and of
course i wont attempt to go out to-
night it must be late- she turned

to look at the clock its almost eleven
oclock she added hastily please
doctor fuller dont telephone for a
nurse i know i shall not want her
around i dont need her-and ive al-
ready taken a cordial dislike to her-
the last words were so like a childs
plea please dont-i wiu be good
that fullers lips twitched but he un-
hooked the receiver

  at least now youre awake you
must have something to eat he said
and he gave an order in a tone so low
that miss salisbury heard only an in-
distinct murmur

  satisfied she leaned back on her pil-
lows then she suddenly awakened to
the fact that she was in a negligee which
while undeniably showing off her love-
liness to advantage was hardly the cos-
tume in which she would have chosen
to appear before a stranger even with
the shelter of an md to play propriety
she desperately caught up the linen
under her chin and snuggled down be-
neath the sheet casting as she did so a
longing glance at her bureau-drawers
where her dainty wrappers were repos-
ing in a few minutes the supper would
be brought in when she would be ex-
pected to sit up bolstered by the pil-
lows and she simply would not appear
before any man in such scanty attire

  wont you be good enough to fetch
me a wrapper from the dresser she
asked i shall need it when the sup-
per youve ordered comes up

  of course he rose and crossed the
room in which drawer shall i find
it

  the second

  by mistake he pulled out the third
in which a mass of negligible lacy white
undergarments stared up at him
hastily shutting it he tried the one
above finding therein several silken
wraps from which to choose

  i havent any kimonos she called
as he stood undecided ive always
heard they had such perfectly lovely
jack rowes



japanese ones for sale in san francisco
that i put off buying any until i arrived
and i havent had time for shopping yet
thats one reason i stayed over but
ive forgotten you dont know any-
thing about me of course i joined a
touring party in boston to see the west
and stop at the exposition but as they
remained here too short a time to satisfy
me i stayed over to join the next party
and return with that yes-as fuller
mechanically took up a violet mass of
liberty satin-til slip that on if youll
be kind enough to bring it here

  throwing it over his arm he brought
it to her she looked up at him her
face just visible above the sheet and as
she thanked him he caught the expres-
sion of her eyes taking the hint he
turned and went back to the bureau
prolonging the dosing of the drawer
until he knew from the soft rustling be-
hind him that she was clothing herself
in the wrap while he waited for per-
mission to turn he stood looking ab-
stractedly at the various toilet articles
on the top of the dresser two photo-
graphs which he instantly guessed to be
those of her father and her mother were
in a double silver frame in the centre
while from a smaller single frame the
portrait of a good-looking young man
stared back at him defiantly her voice
roused him from his contemplation and
he turned with a flush

  t think i heard a knock doctor
fuller

  he crossed and opened the door ad-
mitting a waiter with a tray a small
table was spread invitingly at the side of
the bed miss salisbury supported by
pillows and swathed in soft folds of
shaded satin varying from the most deli-
cate violet to the deepest purple pansy
hues looked like a dainty flower herself
with her face peeping out above the lilac
marabou edging she had managed to
twist her chestnut hair into a great thick
coil loosely piled upon her head and
fuller likened her to the heart of a

violet as bending over her to arrang
the pillows behind her more comfort-
ably he again caught the odor oi
freshly crushed blossoms as she took
the cup of biack coffee he poured fot
her he hastily glanced at her left hand
on the third finger glittered a large soli-
taire something in its saturnine bril-
liance expressive of the young man
whose photograph was on the dresser
evidently she was not a widow in
mourning for her husband but a young
girl about to become a wife an unac-
countable desire to rise and demolish
that particular picture made him give an
imperceptible movement forward

  oh she exclaimed as she noticed
it youre not going to leave me yet
are you i do so want you to tell me
all about my-my accident but of
course if you have other calls to make
to-night-

  i havent im entirely at your ser-
vice he sank back ashamed of his
sudden mad impulse you have the
distinction of being my only patient just
now im really off on a vacation but
i happened to be on the spot as you-er
-were being carried out of the art
building and so i offered my services
i brought you to this hotel as the nearest
point where you couki be properly
looked after and they immediately rec-
ognized you as a guest thus you were
taken to your owm room it was a
fortunate coincidence that you should be
stopping here-

  it was extremely lucky for me that
you were there just at that moment 
she exclaimed warmly im absolutely
alone here my father died last win-
ter- she paused a moment winking
back the dew which had started in her
eyes

  that accounts for her mourning
thought fuller but not for the small
photograph

  and now for the first time in my
life i dont know what to do i m afraid

i	want to see the rest of the exposition


the dragons claw

but i shant dare to step outside the
hotel until the other party arrives

  fuller bent over her reassuringly
im going to take it upon myself if you
will allow me to look after you per-
sonally until your party comes thats
a physicians first duty-to take care of
his patient-and  have the reputation of
being pretty thorough in my treatments
and now you are to begin by trying to
get some sleep im going now if you
feel ill or nervous and want to call me
up during the night my room number is
 but i hardly think youll need me
when you awake id like to have you
call me up anyway will you 

  i surely will she replied and i
most deeply appreciate your kindness to
me doctor its very nice of you to
let me feel that i can call on you at any
time although i hope i shant have to
be so heartless as to disturb you before
breakfast good night and thank you
 she turned her head but he saw the
quick tears in her eyes

  good night and-god keep you

  not until he had softly closed the
door of her chamber did he realize that
he had unconsciously spoken the last
three words aloud but she had seemed
neither astonished nor offended nor
could he know that as the door clicked
after him she echoed his words aloud
finding comfort in their tenderness

ii

  it was nine the next morning before
she awoke to another perfect california
day still heavy-eyed she looked out
of her open window breathing in the
tonic of the exquisitely fresh morning
air her chamber window gave the
vista of the lagoon and art palace and
she could even sec the graceful columns
of the peristyle with a quick shudder
she turned to the serious business of her
toilet and less than an hour later
bathed gowned and feeling fit for what-
ever the day might offer she called doc-
tor fuller on the telephone

  yes im feeling very well thank
you    no  havent breakfasted yet
im going down now to the dining-room

   you have some news to tell me
   youre downstairs yourself ill
see you down there thenand she hung
up the receiver with a little glow of an-
ticipation

  he was not in the lobby as she passed
through nor did she see him until
seated at her small breakfast-table he
sauntered in and paused beside her
with a little gesture of welcome she
motioned to the chair opposite her own

  will you have a cup of coffee with
me doctor fuller she asked as she
poured the steaming aromatic beverage

 thanks-if i may i had a very
light and early breakfast this morning
he replied then added casually as he
took the cup from her ive been to the
police station miss salisbury i thought
i might be able to save you the trouble
of taking the trip youre looking so
well i think i can venture to tell you
all i have learned it isnt very much
after all

  oh what-what did they tell you
did you see the man 

 he nodded yes the chief of
police had the man in to question him
we couldnt get much out of him but
the chief hopes to find a way to make
him talk he thinks hes no novice at
the game and that hes probably been a
government guest at san quentin be-
fore the chiefs put out a drag-net for
the man who escaped-i gave him a
description-and thinks theyll have him
too before long so youre not to
worry his fine dark eyes looked
straight into hers as he gave the admoni-
tion the affair is ended and im
afraid from your appearance im about
to lose my one and only patient

  relief and mischief struggled in her
face i refuse to dismiss you doctor
fuller she said softly-unless youre
no longer interested in my case she
paused suggestively
jack rowes



  i never accept any case unless my
patient agrees to carry out my orders
implicitly and you may not care to fol-
low my prescriptions for instance i
think a little run out to golden gate
park in my machine would clear your
head of any remaining dizziness and
bring the color into your cheeks to be
out in the air is the best tonic for a case
like yours if you approve the pre-
scription ill bring up the car if not
im afraid ill have to consider myself
dismissed

  w ith more anxiety than he dared to
show he sat quietly awaiting her reply
with long downcast eyelashes a color
which needed no tonic to aid it mantling
her cheeks she answered

  if all your prescriptions are as pleas-
ing as this you must be the most popular
physician in los angeles i can think
of nothing which would appeal to me
more than a drive out there on a morn-
ing so divine that is one of the places
i havent visited yet but i hear its re-
markably lovely you are very kind to
suggest taking me youre sure it will
not interfere with any plans you may
have made before you-you met me

  his face lighted with swift pleasure
even as a ray of sunlight struck miss
salisburys diamond solitaire flashing a
satanic prism into his eyes

  ive found the keenest pleasures often
come without previous thought thus
when i take a vacation i drift without
other plans than those which appeal to
me for the moment my time is wholly
at your service-as long as you will per-
mit

  half an hour later doctor fullers
long racy runabout was speeding away
from the exposition grounds past the
towering battlemented heights of the
presidio which forms one of the head-
lands guarding the golden gate swing-
ing south they turned along the famous
parkway on their right its long line of
foam breaking on the stretch of white
sandy beach which ran for miles along

the coast was the pacific so much deep-
er in its sapphirine waters than the green-
ish atlantic to which she had been ac-
customed

  from the military reservation the
clear sweet call of a bugle announced
that a drill was in progress at a point
of vantage fuller stopped the machine
and they spent a half-hour watching the
drilling and maneuvering of the troops
as they sped on towards seal rock
miss salisbury inquired idly

  whats the building on the bluff

  thats the cliff house rather a pop-
ular place for people who drive out from
the city to dine and see the moon over
the wrater its hardly the time of day
for that attraction but perhaps youd
enjoy lunching there

  seeing the sparkle of pleasure in her
eyes he drove up to the hotel out on
the broad roomy piazza seated at a
corner table where they could watch
and enjoy the antics of the hundreds of
seals sunning themselves on the little
island they lunched and chatted fuller
exerting himself to draw the girl out 
topics which showed her natural tastes
she enjoying to the full the rare charm
of his personality now that no future
dangers threatened she was actually be-
ginning to be glad that the accident had
happened to her to bring this new ac-
quaintance into her life naturally ar-
dent and social she had tasted the full
bitterness of what loneliness can mean
to a girl cast entirely on her own re-
sources in a huge caravansary like the
exposition grounds fate had thrown
into her path this handsome young phy-
sician whose credentials and manner
were all that the most fastidious could
require and the mere unconventionality
of their meeting lent to the chance ac-
quaintance added charm

  driving back fuller wrapped her in
one of his motor-coats for she had neg-
lected to bring a heavy wrap and the
chill breeze which combines summer and
winter into one californian day sprang


the dragons claw

up at sunset the sky was a mass of
gorgeous hues crimson banners merg-
ing into golden flame iu the far dis-
tance tamalpais caught the glow on
high rocky crest to the right across the
bay behind the little island reservation
for convicts lay alameda as they
neared the exposition grounds the sun
sank behind the river of molten flame
the pathway through the golden gate

  thank you for the pleasantest day
ive had in san francisco miss salis-
bury offered him her gloved liand as
she was about to enter the lift in the
inside inn i simply cant thank you
adequately its just one of those days
one remembers your prescription is
the nicest one ive ever taken

   i trust youll feel like repeating the
dose-with variations ill call you up
to find out how you are feeling in the
morning if i may

  doctor fuller cigar in mouth walked
the short distance to the art palace and
again stood on the spot where he had
first seen miss salisbury he had not
told her the whole truth regarding the
conversation he had had with the chief
of police the man they held in custody
was a well-known crook long under sus-
picion as a cadet in the white-slave traf-
fic but always managing to escape ar-
rest by the adroitness of his methods

  now weve got him well do our best
to make him squeal but if we dont suc-
ceed theres scarcely a chance in a
hundred that we can get the other fel-
low its the big man behind them both
that we want-the head of the gang i
should advise miss salisbury if shes
waiting over here to join a party to be
extremely careful as to her movements
shes evidently been marked down for
their prey and if shes as pretty as you
describe her and without any relatives
to raise a fuss over her disappearance
they wont give her up without a fight
better warn her not to go about alone
she can hire a plain-clothes man if she
hasnt any other escort

  but doctor fuller had quietly detailed
himself for that duty first procuring
a license to carry a concealed weapon
he had gone to a sporting-goods shop
where he invested in a revolver of the
latest design slipping it along with a
box of cartridges into the pocket of his
motor-coat he felt that the question of
miss salisburys bodyguard was satis-
factorily settled without worrying her
with the knowledge of the necessity for
such precautions had he known with
what powers he was contending what
horrors lay in the following days for
him and the girl he sought to protect he
would have accepted the chiefs advice

  each of the following three mornings
doctor fuller called miss salisbury on
the telephone and jokingly prescribed
a plan for the day which should give
her pleasure and she accepting the
prescriptions in the same spirit in
which they were offered saw the won-
ders of the great exposition from the
gay amusements in the zone to her
own state building far down at the
other end of the grounds enjoying it
all with the companionship of a man
who wholeheartedly shared her pleasure
even while his hand was always in readi-
ness to dose around the weapon in his
pocket

  propinquity necessarily creates inter-
est between two sympathetically attuned
natures miss salisbury was no excep-
tion nor was fuller although he cursed
himself for proving such an easy victim
to a gir- who he had reason to believe
was pledged to another man she found
that the wonders of sightseeing the
beauty of the golden-toued californian
scenery took on a new aspect seen by
his side and were made doubly interest-
ing by his clever mentality three days
of intimate companionship goes a long
way on that path which leads to the ex-
diange of personalities

  on the fourth morning miss salis-
bury fearing fuller was becoming bored
suggested sweetly i think ill go shop-
jack rowes



ping to-day im going to look through
some of those fascinating oriental
places where they sell chinese goods
youve been so kind in taking me about
i feel you need a change a real vaca-
tion-

  if youll let me take you in the ma-
chine it may save you time he sug-
gested hastily and it would be a great
favor to me also i want to get a few
things to bring back to my sister in los
angeles and as i havent the faintest
idea of what would please her i wish
youd help me to select something

  of course ill be very glad if i can
be any help- she conceded doubt-
fully

  you certainly can-of the utmost
and ill efface myselt whenever you
want to get rid ot me he added apolo-
getically you mustnt let me inter-
fere with your own shopping just let
me stay in the background

  i really havent much to do except
buy some trifles and look she con-
fessed i do love to look at pretty
things she ended with a naively fem-
inine touch

  and fuller did not think it necessary
to acquaint her with the fact that he had
purposely created a sister to meet the
exigencies of the situation

  as they wandered about in the big
shop among the buddhas and grotesque-
ly carved ivory images the heavy gii-
nese embroideries and rare curios all
smelling of that incense peculiar to the
orient miss salisbury paused by a ped-
estal supporting an immense bronze bowl
filled with water it represented a minia-
ture lake on the surface floated myriads
of water lotus rose white blue laven-
der the exquisite blooms opening their
hearts of gold in dreamy languorous
splendor the girl lingered beside them
admiringly

  how wonderful she cried raptur-
ously i love these plants so theyre
viy flower you know my father was
an english officer and my mother met

him when she was traveling abroad af-
ter their marriage he was sent to india
where i was born but the indian cli-
mate didnt agree with my mother so a
couple of years afterwards he gave up
his commission and came to america
mother loved these flowers-theyre sa-
cred you know-and they named me
lotus because she was so fond of them
its an odd name for a girl isnt it but
 like it because i love them too and
somehow it brings her very near to me
she died when i was very small

  she bent over them touching the pet-
als with tender finger-tips

  its a charming name and one which
perfectly suggests your personality
said fuller softly you resemble them
surprisingly too that creamy white
one with the pink-tipped petals is ex-
actly like you we have lily and rose
and violet and marguerite for feminine
names why not lotus also

  his voice held such a caressing inflec-
tion she turned aside to hide the flush
in her cheeks he certainly had a way
with him this man and she suddenly
wondered if he made himself as attract-
ive to all his feminine patients could
she have known some of the experiences
through which he had passed her big
eyes would have lost their dreamy qual-
ity and something else would have dilated
them but fuller had learned the secret
of the successful professional man-the
discretion of silence

  wouldnt you like a cup of tea he
asked abruptly for he fancied she was
looking rather white we could drive
over to tates-

  that would be nice she acknowl-
edged then catching sight of some
wrought jade bracelets oh what
lovely coloring  must get one of
those that ones exactly the tint of
lake thun in switzerland dont you
love these things -she picked up a
carved sandalwood fan delicately snif-
fing the spicy fragrance they make
me feel all the richness and splendor of


the dragons claw

the far east-the real east-ihe east of
the statues in the court of the universe
-the camels and elephants and veiled
ladies and slant-eyed orientals the
land of mystery oh i wish i could go
through chinatowrt before i leave san
francisco fm dying to see the quaint
houses and the funny little chinese
babies and the opium-smokers could
i go there would it be safe do you

think r

   he smiled indulgently at her enthusi-
asm its safe enough to visit the
places where visitors are generally ad-
mitted he conceded ive never been
through there myself but i know its
vastly interesting we can get a guide
to show us about some day-

  your pardon sir the chinaman
who was waiting upon them with the pa-
tient immobility of his race ventured to
interrupt deferentially but if you de-
sire a guide through chinatown the best
way to arrange for the trip is to engage
one of the men employed in this shop
they are all thoroughly reliable and it
is safer to hire a courier who comes with
the best recommendations the man-
ager of this shop makes a specialty of
that as an advertisement for his patrons
i am myself one of his most valued
men his head tilted back with con-
scious pride

  that might be a good idea sug-
gested lotus appealing to fuller we
couldnt venture down there all alone
without danger of getting lost could we
this man could show us a lot of places
wed like to see but shouldnt know
about ourselves what do you think

   i certainly shouldnt attempt to go
about chinatown with you alone said
fuller emphatically ill inquire about
their parties at the office this is one of
the best shops in town and their em-
ployees ought to be reliable if youll
excuse me an instant ill go up and see
the manager

  he left lotus tom between the lure
of a violet kimono embroidered in trail-

ing purple wistaria vines and an oyster-
gray one decorated in snowy cherry-blos-
soms

  satisfied with the information re-
ceived from the affably polite oriental
who was head of the firm fuller re-
turned to miss salisbury

  its all right im so glad could
we go now she queried enthusiastic-
ally

  youd best have that cup of tea first
returned fuller you want to be forti-
fied for its quite a trip well put it
off to another day if you prefer no
-as she shook her head youre sure
youre not tired then we might dine
at some restaurant down there and spend
the evening exploring i think do you
like chop-suey

  must i eat it with chop-sticks and
will they serve sodcu she asked laugh-
ing but i forgot being a physician
you probably dont approve of sodeu

  not for a regular beverage but
when hes off on a real vacation even a
doctor can loosen up occasionally he
retorted shall we drive over to tates
first we can meet this man there in
half an hour and take him along with
us 

  covered with smiles and bowing re-
peatedly as he escorted them out sing
wing which he apologetically informed
them was his cognomen placed their
various purchases in the machine

  which kimono did you decide on
inquired fuller idly as he threw in the
clutch and the car started off he pri-
vately hoped she had chosen the violet

  both she sighed ecstatically i
simply couldnt make up my mind be-
tween them so i told him to wrap them
up together which did you prefer
do you think im wickedly extrava-
gant  as she caught the amused twinkle
in his eye i just couldnt resist them
and theyll be useful-later

  the very slight hesitation suggested
an unpleasant possibility

   shes buying her trousseau mut-
jack rowes



tered fuller savagely and asking my
opinion thinking that as im a man my
choice might also be that of her fiance
she cant use me that way

  aloud he replied so disinterestedly
that lotus looked at him in sudden sur-
prise theyre both very pretty of
course but i fancy blue might be more
becoming to you than either men are
always fond of blue you know

  oh the exclamation was linger-
ingly prolonged i thought you liked
them both her evident disappoint-
ment pleased him and besides i
cant wear any other colors-yet you
know i-im still wearing mourning
her voice dropped and it held the
suspicion of tears

  you wont after you are married will
you

  he looked carefully ahead avoiding
her eye as he skilfully guided the car
in and out of the traffic

  married

  it was such a low murmur the noises
of the crowded thoroughfare drowned
it before it could reach his ear with
fast-beating heart lotus sat silent her
creamy skin tinged with rose what
did he mean was he-was he becom-
ing-personal half frightened at her
own sensations she sat motionless her
hands nervously clenched in her lap
fuller thinking she did not care to an-
swer his thrust kept his own silence
until wheeling up to tates he carefully
helped her out and piloted her through
the luncheon-room to the elevator on
the next floor they were shown to one
of the small tables running along the
sides of the long room the centre of
the hall was cleared for dancing and
in a balcony at one end musicians lilted
forth the rhythmic strains of the latest
musical-comedy hits

  isnt it charming lotus gaze
swept the shimmering blue and green
walls done in the gorgeous hues of nat-
ural peacock-feathers jeweled stones
set in the place of the eyes casting a

glittering barbarity of opalescent color
as the concealed electric lighting struck
them from every angle

  i hoped youd like it fuller
ashamed of his burst of ill temper or-
dered an elaborate tea then exerted him-
self to atone it was his misfortune not
her fault that another man had shown
his good taste before fuller had had an
opportunity to meet her himself

  the girl warmed into renewed life
by the artistic charm of the unique cafe
the excellent orange pekoe tea and the
appetizing little sandwiches and pastries
lost her sudden sense of shyness and met
him more than half way whether the
tea a la russe went to his head or the
new dreamily softened velvet of her
glance had that same effect fuller as-
tonished himself by leaning forward as
the orchestra began a seductive waltz
and asking

  do you dance miss salisbury

 i havent-not since-for some
months- then something in his eyes
compelled her to add hastily but i
adore it i-id like to try it-if you
care to

  he did but not until they were half
through the dance did he acknowledge
to himself that his sudden passion for
waltzing had been due to his overwhelm-
ing desire to hold this woman in his
arms to feel her light suppleness melt
against his heart as he swung and turned
and vibrated in perfect harmony to the
rhythm of the heavily-accented melody
she had gotten into his very blood this
lotus bloom from the east and had her
fiance appeared to claim her at that
moment he would have faced a half-
savage man roused to the pitch of mad-
ness to fight for his mate the girl who
had set fire to his hitherto surfeited
pulses

  something of his exultation may have
communicated itself to lotus for the
dance ended she carefully avoided his
eyes as she seated herself again at the
table nor would she dance again al-


the dragons claw

though a new tune was beating out a
temptingly insistent invitation

  wed better be starting for china-
town dont you think she suggested
evasively to his query of whether she
were tired

   downstairs the blandly-smiling china-
man now attired in conventional euro-
pean fashion was waiting for them
they piaced him on the far side of the
roomy seat lotus next to fuller thus
they drove to that eastern portion of
the city known as chinatown into whose
inner mysteries even the police of fris-
co never venture unless in an armed
squad

  i would suggest you leave your ma-
chine here sir sing wing smilingly
informed fuller while we walk about
among the shops

   ive heard said lotus with a side-
long glance at fuller that there are a
lot of subterranean passages hollowed
out beneath here and running for miles
under the earth id like to see what
one of those is like if-if its all right
for us to go there

  wings face became a blank and ful-
ler shot her a warning glance

  nobody is supposed to know about
these things he admonished in a rapid
whisper the chinese guard those se-
crets with their lives you cant pos-
sibly-

  oh yes i understand what it is the
young lady wishes to see wing inter-
rupted mildly it is our theatre of
which she has heard that entrance is
indeed underground the evening per-
formance is the best i think you would
enjoy it better after dinner we will
first go through the places where the
opium-dens used to be before the law
compelled them to be closed of course
you know that it is against the law for
any one to sell or smoke opium now it
is a special privilege that i am allowed

to take you where they used to be

something the ordinary tourist never
secs

  ryou keep them as a sort of show-
place y hazarded fuller

  but thats not what i want to see
lotus full ripe lips pouted  i want to
go where they dont expect sightseers
where they wont all be dressed up in
readiness to make an effective impres-
sion i want to see the real underground
chinese life and homes and people-
you cant said fuller decisively
thats impossible thats something
even the police do not meddle with
youre seeing all that europeans are al-
lowed to well go to see where the
opium dens used to be then dine a a
chinese restaurant and end up by at-
tending a performance at their theatre
that will be quite enough for one day
secretly admiring fullers firmness
lotus meekly followed sing wing
amused and entertained by the queer
narrow streets with the atmosphere and
scents so suggestive of an alien race the
odd sights and the sounds of natives
conversing in their guttural language

  at a low door with a swinging lantern
painted in hieroglyphics beside it wing
knocked in a peculiar manner a coolie
opened the door and they passed into a
narrow passageway wing leading them
into a small room in the back of the
house where there were bunk-like
berths arranged about the walls and
long slender pipes on braziers waiting
for the opium-sleepers who would not
come again

  the close peculiarly narcotic atmos-
phere made lotus gasp she clung to
fullers arm as sing w ing explained the
simple process which constitutes the
opium-fiends paradise

   this is the bunk formerly occupied
by the white woman who was called the
queen of chinatown said wing
proudly she is very beautiful that
woman but she no longer smokes here
iut that men may know this was her
couch tlie royal coat she wore has been
left here

  with reverent fingers he pointed to a
jack rowes



magnificent mandarins coat of barbaric
richness the groundwork was of yellow
satin-the chinese color of royalty-and
it was a mass of heavily embroidered
dragons bodies the eyes emeralds and
rubies which winked up with baneful
glare lotus caught her breath

  oh if i could only find a coat like
that she breathed ecstatically tve
always wanted a mandarins coat for an
evening-wrap-

  you wish to buy sing wing ever
anxious to please had understood her
whisper there is a shop near here
where a friend of mine who imports for
the wealthiest class of chinese has man-
darins coats of the choicest would you
care to visit it

  i should like it very much it is not
one of those places just fixed up for
show 

  wing shook his head it is the be-
ginning of the native quarter-the lo-
cality where wealthy chinese gentlemen
have their homes he explained as ful-
ler looked his keen inquiry but it is
quite safe for you to go there-with
me he added i can take you there
before you dine at the restaurant

  lotus pleasure gleamed in her large
dark eyes fuller satisfied nodded and
the three passed out of the stiflingly
close den into the passageway then up
to the open air where they threaded nar-
row streets peopled with soft-footed chi-
nese tiny shops crowded with odd
wares peeped out at them unexpectedly
fuller with sing wing stopped for an
instant to gaze through a window filled
with oriental weapons of unique design
glistening steel blades set in weird sil-
ver-encrusted handles

  wing drew his attention to a peculiar
dirk beginning a voluble explanation of
the characters engraved on its surface
lotus just in front of them turned the
corner of the small passageway down
which they were to take a short cut to
the next street fuller sensing she
had gone on while they lingered and

anxious not to lose sight of her hurried
after

  as he and sing wing turned the cor-
ner a long narrow alley stretched out
before them it was quite deserted lotus
had disappeared as completely as though
the earth had opened and swallowed her
up

ill

  with a swift glance which swept the
bare walls painted in chinese characters
extolling the shops importations fuller
noted that no door broke its space one
step carried him back to the street but
no graceful black-gowned figure lingered
at the shop-windows

  murder in his heart an oath on his
lips fuller turned to wing

  damn you where is she where
has she gone 

  he grasped the chinamans arm with
fingers of iron as his right hand intui-
tively sought the chill weight which
sagged in his pocket wing though he
must have realized that death was very
near in that instant met the black wrath
in fullers face with the bland immo-
bility of the native oriental

  where has she gone he repeated
calmly i dont know i didnt see her
i was standing behind you looking at
those small swords

  one step forward and fullers loaded
revolver pressed against sing wings
yellow temple they were well around
the corner in the alley in which lotus
had disappeared and apparently none of
the pedestrians in the narrow street be-
hind had noticed the unusual tableau

  answer me-the truth  fullers
tones shook with rage and anxiety then
as a faint sweet odor drifted to his
nostrils on some wandering current of
air my god whats that chloro-
form where does that come from
what has become of her youre re-
sponsible for her safety and by god
if she comes to any harm youll pay for
it
c

the dragons claw

  with a swift movement he grasped
wings collar even with the cold bar-
rel against his oily skin sing  ing s
features did not flinch

  no one can hold me responsible for
anything which may happen to one or
my party when he or she goes off alone
and leaves me said wing slowly and
i wouldnt fire off that gun if i were
you sir ive a lot of friends in this
neighborhood-were in the native quar-
ter-and the chinese are not fond of you
foreign devils if you shoot i wont
answer for your life and that would
not help to bring miss salisbury back
to you

  fuller lowered the revolver still hold-
ing wing firmly the latter made no
attempt to break away but stood regard-
ing his captor stolidly

  miss salisbury how did you know
her name demanded fuller harshly

  for an instant a gleam shot through
wings beady eyes gone almost before
it revealed itself

  that was the name on the packages
sir

  but we took the packages along in
the machine there was no address on
them

  no sir not on those but she had
other goods sent to her hotel

  fuller regarded wing for an instant
then hauling the chinaman along he
plunged down the alley it led for half
a block through walls covered with
crudely-colored advertisements then sud-
denly opened out into another street run-
ning parallel to the one they had left and
much like it in character

  wheres the policeman on this beat
his voice so dry he could scarcely articu-
late fuller held wing by his burning
glance

  no policeman here the chinese
shook his head they come here-two
together-once every evening every
one knows when they are coming
everything is quiet here then he
showed his teeth for a moment

 show me the quickest way to the
nearest one around here commanded
fuller savagely

  but it was a good half-hour between
lotus disappearance and the time they
succeeded in finding a policeman he
listened to fullers hurried story in si-
lence whistled for a brother officer and
when he appeared they both accompanied
fuller and wing back to the comer
where lotus had mysteriously vanished

  at a whispered word from the first
officer handcuffs were slipped on sing
wing before the oriental could protest
and leaving him locked securely to the
burly guardian fuller drew the other
officer aside

  ive reason to believe miss salisbury
has not wandered away by herself as
wing suggests this is no accidental
case of getting lost said fuller sternly
a white line appearing about his clear-
cut mouth an attempt was made on
her by white-slavers only four days ago
i happened to be on hand when they were
carrying her away and prevented them
from accomplishing it but chief ocon-
nell warned me they might make another
attempt and not to allow her to go out
anywhere unaccompanied ive been
with her constantly ever since he
ended with a groan

  haggerty was sympathetic in spite of
his long service on the force he went
over the wall carefully sounding the
stucco-work over the bricks but the solid
masonry gave forth no trace of hollow
spaces

  he shook his head doubtfully its
one o them mystery cases we cant ferret
out he confessed if its any comfort
to ye ill tell yer in confidence that in
this last month three young girls have
disappeared not far from this very spot
theyve never been heard from although
weve turned this part of the chinks
town upside-down its me own belief
theres a secret passage somewhere here-
abouts leading down into the first tier
of underground passages i suppose you
tack rowes



know chinatowns built more down un-
der the earth than on top dont ye

  fuller sick at heart impotent to do
anything but listen nodded impatiently

  well theres six tiers that we know
about one built right on top of the other
but how many more holes below and
what deviltry goes on down there in the
lowest depths we never even try to guess
we know theres every kind of vice the
brain of the foreign divils can think up
and the slave traffic isnt wholly confined
to their own race theres many a young
white girl down there thats come from
a good home up on top of gods earth
but once them highbinders gets hold of
them its the end when theyre-fin-
ished-they bury em down there
course im not sayin he hastened to
add as he noted the abject misery in
fullers face that thats whats hap-
pened to miss salisbury but it looks
mighty suspicious considerin shes had
it tried on her before them highbind-
ers never risk kidnapin any girl until
theyve got a line on her and theyre al-
ways careful to pick out one that hasnt
any relatives near to kick up a row over
her disappearance she must look
mighty fine to em-the bastes he
spat venomously at the wall

  fuller felt the world reeling about him
it was his fault entirely due to his own
momentary interest in wings explana-
tion regarding the dirk that he had lost
sight of lotus for an instant black
rage against himself in his heart he im-
potently clenched his hands until the nails
entered the palms haggerty his big
irish heart stirring with pity offered the
only suggestion he could think of

  why dont you get the chief to give
you a permit sor and take some friends
and a couple of us in plain clothes along
with you and search through all the
houses in this neighborhood its the
only way to get a trace of her if shes
locked up you could pass yourself off
as one o them young bloods-beggin yer
pardon sor-who comes here when they

feels like goin off on a spree thats a bit
out o the ordinary-you know i youd
be surprised to know how many of the
richest fellers comes here for that pur-
pose sor havent ye got no friends
here who could take ye about as though
they was showin ye a good time

  fuller pondered he had many ac-
quaintances in the city but no friend
close enough to take into his confidence
in regard to lotus haggertys keen
eyes searched the young doctors set
stern features anxiously

  no friend who knows th ropes down
here he probed hopefully a man
like ye must know some one who could
take ye off on a bat

  with the echo of the phrase the keen
caustic features of ralph donaldson
boyish schoolmate and now star reporter
on one of friscos leading newspapers
rose up before him the light of a former
good fellowship in his smiling gray eyes

 the very man do you know
donaldson of the argus fuller asked
hurriedly

  sure i do every man on the force
knows him hes a member of the
secret reserve police himself ye know
him glory to god theres th man
fer ye call him up as fast as iver ye
can wed better be goin sor for
fuller loath to leave the spot lingered
vainly yell niver find her this way
if its as we think some divil has her
safe in his hole by this time the sooner
ye get hold of donaldson the sooner
yell be likely to find her

  but as haggerty moved off with ful-
ler to where wing and the other officer
awaited them he muttered to himself
poor divil sure one can see with half
an eye hes clean daffy about her small
good will it do him hell niver set
eyes on her again them hastesll do
fer her sure enough but hell likely
go crazy off his nut if he dont get lively
huntin fer her hes the look in his
eyes of a madman aready well go
along with him to keep him in hand

when he finds out the truth and loses
his head poor little girl i niver seen
one o them get out o here alive yet

iv

 all this time-had fuller and hag-
gerty been able to peer through the
ground below them they would have
seen lotus salisbury lying in a tiny
room until the fumes of the chloroform
which had saturated the cloth about her
mouth should have worn off sufficiently
for her to be brought before her future
owner and master chin ling wu the
boss of decadent chinatown trafficker
in souls master of destinies the dragon
of the underworld

  a withered clawlike hand noiselessly
opened the door and a stooping chinese
hag in whose crackling parchment skin
the fingers of depravity had creased
cavernous wrinkles slipped in silently
standing above lotus salisbury and star-
ing down at the creamy pale features
the reddish golden hair puzzled her
with curious prying talons she stealtliily
lifted the girls hat

 lotus opened her eyes the next in-
stant her shrill scream rang through the
room the hag smiled at her a facial
contortion so horrible that lotus covered
her eyes then forcing herself with a
strong effort of will to open them she
looked about her she saw the gaudily-
decorated walls of a tiny room hung in
pictured rice-paper writhing dragons
crawling in serpentine convolutions
across its golden surface over in one
corner a squat grotesquely-carved chi-
nese god glowered in diabolical ugliness
rich silken shantungs covered with
masses of gorgeous embroideries con-
cealed the low ceiling on a teakwood
tabouret a slender pipe lay in readiness
to woo soothing dreams of the poppy
i he heavy odors of strange spices the
smell of joss-sticks smouldering before
the idol all mingled to produce that other
odor peculiar to oriental life and cus-
toms which to occidentals is too sug-

gestive to be agreeable there were no
windows the only ventilation being the
open door

  missee wakee likee diinkr

  reiterated gesticulation convinced
lotus the creature was suggesting food
and drink she shook her head decid-
edly then unsteadily rose to her feet
she would take no nourishment in this
place lest the food be drugged

  with surprising celerity the old
woman reached the door and passed out
shutting it after her and shooting the bolt
on the outside before lotus could follow
there was a small aperture covered with
an iron grating through which the girl
peered but only a narrow passageway
met her view

  summoning all her strength lotus
shrieked aloud but only the vibration of
her own call answered her she shook
the barred grating furiously but it re-
sisted all her efforts many girlish
hands had pitted their puny strength
against its iron immutability

  lotus looked about her in frantic
search of some other way of escape
mounting on top of the luxurious pil-
low-smothered couch to examine the
ceiling but the hangings covered only a
painted wall the room was simply a
box the door the only exit an antique
chinese temple - lantern of wrought
bronze was suspended from the centre of
the ceiling wicks floating in perfumed
oil supplying the dim light daylight
never penetrated to that cavern and
lotus suddenly remembering that she
wore her watch looked at the small time-
piece the hands stood at eight

  eight oclock she should now be
seated opposite doctor fuller in some
fascinating little chinese restaurant
drinking his health in sodeu the native
wine of the country what had become
of him how had he allowed such a
thing as this to happen to her some-
thing told her he would have defended
her with his life had he known that dan-
ger threatened had he also been at-
jack rowes



tacked perhaps killed she shuddered
pressing her hands before her eyes not
that anything but that he was so
fine so tender so brave-

  plitty tlings niakee lithle chinee

  it was ah loo her arms piled high
with varicolored silks and trailing sashes
behind her ranged silently against the
walls were five sturdy chinese women
of low caste a chill passed over lotus
even as she resolutely shook her head at
ah loo

  i wont change into those things if
thats what you want she said steadily

  ah loo flung up her hands before
lotus could resist two women had
passed behind her each catching a hand
two others with movements so swift she
could only gasp her outraged astonish-
ment tripped her up and laid her flat on
the ground holding her down effectively
while ah loo and the fifth woman
searched for the invisible fastenings
holding the outlandish clothing of the
female foreign devil

  the moments which followed were
ages of agony to the sensitive refined
highly-strung lotus helpless as a little
child in thir hands she lay at their
mercy slow scorching tears welling
from her closed eyes as she realized
her impotence the full bitterness of her
absolute subjection

  after what seemed hours the fumbling
clumsy fingers solved the secrets of her
gown and drew it off the dainty lin-
gerie beneath proved an easier matter
an occasional grunt of condemnation or
approval belied the stolidity of their ex-
pression lotus was beginning to under-
stand that the outward calm of the ori-
ental race is a mask to conceal rather
than express their governing emotions

  eyes closed abandoned to their min-
istrations lotus finally felt the caressing
softness of silken folds slipping about
her another instant and they stood back
about the walls exchanging interested
criticisms regarding the success of their
labors

  you domee long now coaxed ah
loo evidently the only one who dared
attempt english mathler say we
makee you clom damn click

  lotus sat up dazedly putting her hand
to her head they had taken down her
hair and over the blue satin of her
gorgeous wrap it shimmered like bur-
nished gold the women pointed at it
chattering like magpies the hubbub
made her head swim but she voiced one
last defiance

  i shall obey no orders issued by your
master i shall tot go to his-whatever
it is he expects me to go to he can kill
me if he chooses-i wish he would
with a little moan she buried her face
in her hands

  a word from ah loo and before
lotus realized how they had accom-
plished it she was raised from the floor
hoisted in their arms and being carried
helpless as a baby out of the room
down the corridor and through the bar-
red iron door at the end into another
winding passage dark noisome and
smelling of dank earth all along this
second passage tiny grated windows ap-
peared at intervals in the walls small
white blots like pieces of paper tacked
up beside them behind the apertures
a dim light glimmered but not sufficiently
strong for lotus to glimpse the interior
of the dens she shook with a nameless
fear what unspeakable things might not
be concealed in their depths and she
lotus salisbury-to what scenes of
degradation was she about to be exposed 
her very skin crawled with horror be-
neath the gossamer-soft satin covering
it was a magnificent wrap in which they
had clothed her just such a marvelously
embroidered mandarins coat as that for
which she had expressed a desire only
that same afternoon it was hers now
but at what a cost

  a sudden halt and lotus saw they
were in front of a step-ladder rising
straight up to the low ceiling one of
the women mounted pushing up a trap-


the dragons claw

door hardly perceivable in the gloom
throwing it up to its entire width she
leaned down caught lotus hands and
with the help of the other women raised
her from one step to another until at last
her head appeared above the open space
and she was jostled through the women
scrambled after her closed the trap-
door and catching her up again con-
tinued their shambling progress through
a cellar until they came to a narrow
staircase they mounted in shuffling si-
lence their padded feet making a curious
thudding vibration on the wooden treads

  at the top of the staircase a barred
and bolted door stopped them ah loo
rapped cautiously giving an unintelligible
answer to a muffled voice from the out-
side the door was thrown wide re-
vealing to lotus astonished gaze the
luxurious interior of a home belonging
to a chinese gentleman of the wealthiest
class

  in one moment she had been trans-
ported from the murky dreariness of an
underground prison to the richness of a
miniature palace the rooms through
which they passed though small were
crowded with unique curios and price-
less articles of vertu which even to
lotus inexperience suggested the re-
sources of an aladdin the dark polish
of the bronzes the superbly embroidered
teakwood screens the cunningly executed
tapestried walls done in infinitesimal
silken stitches and representing chinese
landscapes-the temples the rivers the
great walls of the sacred city itself-
all limned their details on her vision al-
though she had small interest in anything
at the time save the figure of chin ling
 u seated cross-legged on a raised dais
in one comer of the room in the dis-
tance he looked like a chinese god his
only sign of life the glint of his jetty
ead eyes as the women entered bear-
ing lotus in their midst

   carefully setting her down on the
  ground before him they kowtowed in
  unison chin ling wu raised his hand

and the women actually seemed to fade
away so noiselessly did they retreat
lotus intent only on this man facing her
did not notice their withdrawal nor that
the heavy screens taking the place of
doors had been pushed back into place

v

  chin ling wu eyed her serenely his
gaze including every detail of her attire
from the glories of her unbound hair to
the small chinese slippers incasing her
feet his scrutiny lingered criticised
annotated seeming to pierce beneath the
flimsy covering to every curve every
luscious line of grace of her exquisitely
modeled figure a scarlet flood mounted
to her cheeks this cold-blooded ap-
praisal of her person was an insult un-
der which her very soul revolted she
threw up her head and clutching the
sheer fabric about her silently showed
her unutterable contempt by turning her
back upon him

  for some moments the stillness of
the room was unbroken her nerves
strained to the breaking-point for inac-
tion in times of crises is deadly lotus
felt that in another secor  she would
shriek aloud the sound c wus meas-
ured tones relieved the t- isicn he
spoke in perfect english te only sug-
gestion of a foreign tongue being a slight
difficulty with the letter r

  my servant tells me you refuse our
native dishes that is unwise hysteria
and tears are also natural enemies to
your most powerful assets youth and
beauty which are to be valued as divine
gifts miss salisbury this is the la-t
time you will ever hear that name uttered
by human lips your own name of lotus
blossom in our tongue is the name by
which you will be known

  you know my name surprise tore
the query from lotus

  he bowed complaisantly and much
more-your history your age your ac-
complishments yotir disposition i
would the last were more femininely
jack rowes



yielding with more adaptability than you
are displaying but that will come later
those who will not bow to the stress of
circumstances must break

  lotus shrank back

  those who are clever quickly adapt
themselves to strange surroundings es-
pecially the very young he went on
i would that you were only fifteen
still your beauty has matured and will
increase when lapped in the luxury with
which we surround our high-caste
women come i will ring for fresh
chop-suey and cumquats and afterwards
i myself will teach you the secrets of the
poppy-fields you know not the delights
erf its dreams there is no other earthly
sensation to which it can be compared
i who have known them all say this
you shall taste the blisses of the celestial
heights waking you shall sway the
destinies of men  sleeping you shall float
disembodied in that ethereal paradise
whence you will return only for the ful-
filment of your own destiny come
drink with me to your future in our
native sodeu of which this is a rare im-
perial brand

  he lifted a small round cup of an-
tique chinaware pouring into it a liquid
from one of the fat little jugs and in-
clining his yellow bald head offered it
to lotus

  i will not drink you drugged me
before her big dark eyes languor-
ous no longer flared desperately i be-
lieve it was you who d that attack
made on me four days ago although the
men were not chinese

  chin ling wus bland features relaxed
into a smile

  you show decided pentration o
lotus bloom i had seen you at the
exposition surrounded by your party of
hideous middled-aged americans in
their midst your unusual loveliness
glowed like a flower that which i
covet i take steps to acquire and the
weapons in my power permit me to carry
out my desires i had looked you up

that there might be no miscarriage in my
plans  found you were alone travel-
ing with a tourists party i gave orders
to american servants whom i often em-
ploy lest suspicion fall on my race that
you should be brought here that at-
tempt failed as you know i then placed
one of my own most trusted servants in
the employ of a friend of mine who keeps
a shop especially interesting for tourists
knowing that some time you would in-
evitably visit it had you not done so
i should still have found other means
to get you that was only one of my
plants as you call it in the english lan-
guage it was my servant who decoyed
you into visiting this locality he also
took up the attention of that meddling
young fool of a doctor from los angeles
who prevented my plans from being suc-
cessfully carried out the first time he
cannot however interfere again

  lotus shivered he could mean but
one thing for had fuller been living he
would not have rested until he had found
her for a moment the world went
black

  the next she knew she felt chin ling
wus touch on her arm as he held the
wine-cup to her lips with a furious
gesture she dashed it away the price-
less china fell on the rug spilling the
contents her spirit knew no cow-
ardice but her flesh cringed as she
caught the expression in his lashless
beady eyes

  i will not drink she panted fear-
lessly i will eat nothing in this place
youve drugged me twice-youd do it
again ill starve to death first id
far rather die than live the life youre
trying to force upon me death isnt
so much to be feared as a life of tor-
ture 

  something akin to admiration showed
in his eyes even as he spread his hands
apart in a gesture of disavowal

  but you do not understand the
future before you is brilliant you will
be the most honored guest in the house-

hold of the most powerful mandarin
within the walls of pekin

  pekin my god are you planning
to send me to pekin 

  as a most particular favor i was
sure you could not understand the great
honors which are in store for you he
beamed unctuously his oily skin glisten-
ing in the close atmosphere when i
first saw you i knew you to be the
woman lu tung had ordered me to bring
him from america he has set his heart
on just such a face and figure such
wonderful coloring as yours you are
unique you were born to wear the im-
perial yellow if only as the favorite in
the august palace of lu tung he is a
great artist in every line which the world
has to offer of its best you americans
know not the meaning of the word
civilization our own dates back to
long before the days of confucius many
centuries before the christian era you
are but children we are the adult race
you shall see the wonders of our great
cities you shall have servants by the
score to wait upon you you will not
even be permitted to cross the room
without attendants under lu tungs

for you he will give many hundred tael
if you prove to be as beautiful as i be-
lieve up above in the world of human
civilization modesty is a word to be
reverenced down here hidden in the
secret bowels of the earth it is super-
fluous this is no time for an exhibi-
tion of crude hysterical modesty it is
a question concerning only the worth of
your intrinsic value in my opinion how
many tael i may ask for you of the rich-
est mandarin in pekin you may be
worth much-you promise well-but
often one finds some crudity of confor-
mation some defect which discredits ex-
perienced judgment throw off your
garments o lotus bloom and turn
slowly about

whirling around lotus faced him the

robe clutched about her her great dark
eyes blazing insanely her voice when
she conquered it shook with passionate
wrath

  you have a different woman to deal
with o chin ling wu from any of
those unfortunate tame-spirited victims
with whom you have hitherto dealt i
refuse to defile my own self-respect by
obeying you im not afraid to die but
youll find you cant break me unless you
kill me either give me death or set me
free

  she flung out her bare arms in a superb
gesture her courage restored now that
the crisis was at hand an odd guttural
grunt from wu answered her

  you talk nonsense he clicked out
the words curtly do you think im
fool enough to turn you loose with the
knowledge of the secrets of my house-
hold which you possess as to death
i never destroy valuable property youre
not the only girl who has tried to defy
me many have been quite as trouble-
some as you do you know what has
become of them no you cannot
guess as you passed through the sec-
ond corridor on your way to the trap-
door you may have noticed some small
openings in the walls with barred grat-
ings before them yes but you could
not see within had you done so you
would not have needed me to enlighten
you in each cell lies a young girl as
good as innocent as foolishly preju-
diced against our honorable ancient cus-
toms as you yourself and each of
those girls has passed my personal ap-
probation on the outside of their cells
a small card bears their new name
weight physical condition and points of
excellence signed by the greatest au-
thority in chinatown chin ling wu
each and every one of them was ex-
tremely annoying in the beginning
now should you open their doors you
would find most of them resigned to
their fate already dreaming of the new
country which will be their future home

as they breathe in the elysium of the
poppy-secd most of them are girls from
a class lower than your own-i do not
often attempt to remove a girl of inde-
pendent means i should not have taken
you had i not been satisfied with the re-
sult of the inquiries i made you are
the only one of the type lu tung com-
manded me to bring him which i am
satisfied to offer him yrou promise
much but a successful business mer-
chant is content only with results we
are alone safe from intrusion should
you cry with all your strength to your
gods no one would come to you but
you would not be so foolish this is my
private apartment into which no one
ventures save at my command in a
moment you will be at liberty to swathe
yourself in as many wraps as you desire
come lotus bloom show yourself for
what you are an exquisite woman proud
of her own beauty happy in the knowl-
edge that she is a living human treasure
above price

  shaking with horror lotus glanced
rapidiy about the room she could see
no possible way of escape but over in
one comer a complete suit of antique
armor attracted her attention the glove
of meshed mail held a short sword in its
clasp with no other thought save its
possession lotus backed towards it her
face turned innocently to wu think-
ing she was choosing a spot as far dis-
tant from him as possible in which to
obey his orders he made no move to
intercept her but still sat cross-legged
on his dais

  the soft jingle of the suit of mail
warned lotus she had reached her ob-
ject stealthily she put out her hand
hidden beneath the drooping sleeve of
her coat a shudder passed over her as
she felt the hilt within her palm using
the other hand to aid her she quietly
drew the weapon from the sheath the
leather scabbard from wus distant po-
sition still appearing to be filled with the
steel blade exultation nerved her

here was a way of escape if the worst
threatened

  patience is an admirable trait chin
ling wus perfect english floated across
to her  but there are cases when it ceases
to be a virtue i have no more time to
waste shall i call in my servants to
carry out the commands i have given
you obey me at once or i shall be
forced to do so

  lotus her hand tightly clenched over
the weapon flung back her answer be-
tween set teeth

  never i will not obey you i am
not your slave i will not desecrate my-
self in my own sight i-

  the sound of a chinese gong vibrated
metallically resonant chin ling wu
laid down the padded wand as ah loo
entered quick guttural mutterings
passed between them and she vanished

  anger at white heat gleamed from
wus slits of eyes as he glared at lotus
shaking with a nervous tremor she
awaited her fate her gold-crowned head
thrown bravely back her trembling
fingers clasping the leathern hilt and
chin ling wu keen analyst of feminine
moods tried her with that most difficult
test of all-the test of profound con-
tinued silence in which the orientals are
adept not a breath disturbed that at-
mosphere of sinister voluptuousness at
the end of five minutes it was only by a
supreme effort of will that lotus held
herself erect

  a sharp cry involuntarily escaped her
as the heavy screens swung aside into
the room a crowd of women poured all
in native costume but the features of
eight young girls were unmistakably
american terror-stricken resignedly
stolid vividly alert as their differing
temperaments expressed  he attendant
native women stood back to guard the
screens the girls grouped together in
the centre of the room they looked
with frightened eyes at lotus defiant
attitude not one daring to speak to her

  to see is to believe-it was wus


the dragons claw

voice and at its chill inflexibility the girl
shivered these are the girls of whom
i spoke each has been brought from
her cell below to prove my truth each
one was like yourself some wiser than
others obeyed me pothers more foolish
refused to bend  broke them as i now
will break you what follows you have
brought on yourself alone this is the
discipline with which i punish disobe-
dience

  enthroned on his dais like an emperor
wu uttered a string of orders to his na-
tive women they moved towards lotus
in stealthy unison with a bound she
sprang in among the young white girls

  why dont you all do something
she flung at their appalled inaction
wert all americans-all of us are
you going to let this monster lock you
up forever without a fight its better
to die together now than to live on in
this creatures power

  one of the women seized lotus by
the shoulder as another grasping at her
loose coat sought to tear it away wtith
a gasp of rage lotus turned on them
like a beautiful furv

  dont you dare touch me    did
they treat you all like this 

  she appealed to the girls some
nodded others turned aside

  oh its shameful-shameful lotus
cried and then quite suddenly she lost
her head for other slaves had crowded
upon her bearing her down like a deer
surrounded by a pack of hounds the
world whirled about her the air turned
into a red mist she struck using the
short blade which she had concealed in
her sleeve

  squealing cries of astonishment rage
and pain brought her to herself she
looked about like a person emerging
from a trance she stood alone against
the walls as far away as they could get
the white girls cowered screaming and
the chinese slaves had also drawn away
from her in terror two of them were
howling in fright a broad scratch on

the arm of one a gash across the cheek
of another testifying to the serviceabil-
ity of the blunt old weapon

  holding them at bay with her crim-
son-stained blade lotus laughed hyster-
ically

  i told you im different from the
rest she flung across at wu if you
try such a thing again ill stab myself
instead of those devils

  with one agile movement wu swung
himself to his feet her threat although
she was not aware of it was the most
potent weapon she could have found
she must not be allowed to mutilate her
beauty

 so his tones shook from the
tempest of anger seething within him
so we shall see you shall be
thrown into a cell like the ones in which
these slave-girls are locked there you
shall lie alone in the darkness in dis-
comfort until you come to your senses
there you shall be taught to smoke the
opium-pipe whether you refuse it or
not  ah loo

  the old native crept up to him wu
whispered his instructions a glow of sat-
isfaction flitting over his features as ah
loo kowtowed and withdrew

  lotus turned to the cringing girls-
eight young softly rounded fresh
pretty things all attractive in their dif-
fering types all with the glamor of
youth and health all apparently fright-
ened to death at her bold defense they
eyed her in appalled admiration

  were all americans she exclaimed
rapidly and were not going to give
up our freedom to a demon like wu
there are nine of us if youll help
me-

  she ended in a scream which was
smothered by a scarf thrown over her
head from behind the struggle was
sharp and brief from a piercing cry
lotus judged that her weapon again had
done good service before it was wrested
from her and she was caught up half
stifled helpless and jostled amid a con-
tack rowes



fusing babel of chinese expletives but
one voice w hich she knew by its sibilant
timbre to be wus muttered some crisp
phrases which turned her sick and cold
as she was borne away

  down the staircase then lowered care-
fully through the trapdoor down the
stepladder then the grate of a bolt shot
back and at last she was laid on a mat-
tress and the hands which had pinioned
her fell away with quick scuttliugs the
women fled from the cell of this white
girl who was crazed with the spirit oi
seven furious fighting devils

  and lotus was alone to think over
those pregnant sentences which had been
repeating themselves in ceaseless routine
since she had been carried from his pri-
vate apartment

  because you are a bad example to my
girls i allow you to go without having
attained my object your spirit would
awaken the admiration of the high god
of our devils himself you please me
greatly i shall reconsider my decision
to sell you to lu tung i am rich
enough to indulge my own fancies
later i shall come to you to teach you
obedience this will i feel sure be
the wisest way to deal with such a for-
eign devil as you my golden lotus

  she struck out her hands blindly was
there no way of escape save-death

vi

  lotus opened her eyes to see what
possible means of escape offered within
her cell it was a tiny box just large
enough to contain the mattress lying on
the ground the small brazier with its
pale glow and a rug on which to sit or
kneel the ceiling above was apparently
fashioned of the heavy paper which the
chinese utilize for the building of their
homes

  too nervous to lie still lotus rose
and peered out between the bars of her
cage

  hello hello she called softly but
clearly is any one near me

  there was a moment of silcncc while
she waited tensely anxious then a
whisper came from the wall beside her
hush ah looll hear and punish
you you mustnt make a noise
theyll drug you if you do

  lotus dropped her voice who are
you she murmured how did you
get in here

  im charlotte smith alamedas my
home across the bay i wras on an ex-
cursion-boat when i met a man who-
who flirted with me he sat down be-
side me and we talked and finally he
asked me to go to dinner with him i-
i accepted-i thought he was so nice
and jolly he took me to dinner in a
little restaurant and-thats all i knewr
until i woke up here

  the voice broke in a sob lotus
hands clenched

  and dont you want to get out she
asked arent you going to make a
fuss about being locked in here and-and
all the horrors that are coming

  wrhats the use i did make an aw-
ful fuss in the beginning but you or
any one else cant get ahead of wu if
we cry and scream he punishes us by
taking away the opium

  do you smokef asked lotus hor-
rified

  of course we all do the sooner you
learn how the better youll have the
loveliest dreams youll forget every-
thing youve been through and all thats
before you nothing really matters
much if you only have your pipe and
wu gives us all we want hes willing
we should forget our troubles its the
only thing that keeps us alive i guess
youd better try it for wus angry at
you and when hes like that he  stop at
nothing hes a devil-a devil-

  the voice filtered away into silence
lotus writhed in anguish

  are all the girls here like you   she
demanded dont any of them try to
to kill themselves

  what for were comfortable and
the dragons claw

wu comes down only once a day to see
how were getting on theres no chance
for escape i think were directly un-
derneath his own house its one of the
show-places in chinatown you know
but nobody suspects hes got a subterra-
nean passage beneath his cellar theres
more than one too one leads down to
the water-front for mary snow was
brought in from a boat and she wasnt
doped as much as she pretended so she
knew she was being carried in through
a great long passage hush ah loos
coming if she thinks were talking
shell take away my pipe

  silence reigned sick at heart lotus
sank down on her mattress would she
ever become like this girl resigned to her
destiny living only in the ecstasies of
her opium-dreams  again wus threat
rang through her brain

  later i shall come to you to teach
you obedience

  a dew of terror broke out over her
she knew he would keep his word
there was no way of escape she
looked wildly about against the wall
the pale light of the brazier drew her
gaze a nascent glimmer in the dim
gloom if opium but held the power to
kill but death came through that chan-
nel only after long months of wasting
oblivion and she knew the drug would
never be allowed her in sufficient quan-
tities to injure her physical health

  fascinated by the dull gleam she lay
watching it with half-closed eyes until
halt hypnotized it seemed to her that the
glow permeated the cell like a living
personality she stretched out her arms
to it

   light mame fire she cried ex-
citedly fire

  in that word lay her release death
by tire was a horror yet it was a horror
to be preferred to a life of unutterable
degradation to set her mattress on fire
and tlien smother to death in her cell-
but that would not help the other poor
gtrls locked up beside her freedom for

herself for all-she would make the at-
tempt

  her eyes sought the low ceiling it
was not too high for her to reach easily
with hands thrown above her head she
got up and tried it her fingers touching
the heavy paper what lay directly
above she drummed with tentative
knuckles it sounded hollow

  giving herself no time to waver she
caught up the brazier by its slender
bronze legs and extending it above her
head held it immovable the beat from
the tlame making brownish indentations
in the paper ceiling presently it began
to curl then catch and finally the hole
widened sufficiently for lotus to see the
narrow width of the hollow between the
ceiling and the flooring above it was
of wood but even the tiniest flame will
eventually bum its way through sea-
soned timbers and lotus patiently hold-
ing the brazier saw the wood shrink and
catch writhe and curl as the sparks ate
their way upward through the heart of
the flimsy wood

  the odor of scorching paper the
smoke of burning timber bore down
upon her gasping she set down the
brazier while she wet one sleeve of her
coat in water standing by in a jug then
holding it with one hand before her face
she again erected the brazier in the
other presently the ceiling had curled
apart until a sizable hollow appeared
then it occurred to her to seize the small
rug and thrust it into the aperture thus
hastening her work of destruction act-
ing on the impulse lotus grasped it
and stuffing it into the hole applied the
whole heat of the brazier to its rough
woolen surface

  and then things began to happen as
the rug caught fire lotus drew back
her face pressed to the grating for fresh-
er air as she watched the conflagration

  whats all this smudge  whew
its choking me  i cant breathe oh
my goodness were on fire down here
well burn to death help help i
jack rowes



  the girls shrieks rang through the
small passage shuffling steps padded
along outside one glance was enough
to tell ah loo that the girls were in
grave danger shooting hack the bolts
of their cells as she ran she flung back
their prison doors then not pausing to
see what became of them scurried away
at top speed

  lotus blindly stepped into the cor-
ridor the wet sleeve still pressed against
her face eyes smarting half choked
she yet paused to make sure that no girt
had been left imprisoned from every
door a girl crept forth crazed with fear
ready to beat her way to air and free-
dom

  follow me called lotus ah loos
left the barred door open come before
she can get help to the trapdoor-up
the staircase-quick 

  they hurled themselves after her
down the corridor up the stepladder
into the dark cellar and up the narrow
staircase they fled fear lending them
wings

  the door at the top was only closed
not bolted ah loo in her mad flight-
for none knew better than she the hor-
rors of a lire in chinatown-had for-
gotten to lock it in her wild rush for
help the girls poured into the quiet
luxury of wus mansion too excited to
use their brains in the opportunity of-
fered for escape

  youll have to look out for your-
selves now cried lotus wildly try
to find a way out of the house there
must be doors and windows hurry
well be found and locked up again if
we dont escape now

  the sound of running feet hastened
them the girls separated vanishing in
different directions the foostcps and
voices drew nearer with the desper-
ation of the hunted lotus flung herself
behind a screen in one comer of the
room in which she found herself and
crouching listened with bated breath as
a crowd of chinese entered

  ah loo was in their midst wringing
lier hands at sight of chin ling wus
white set face and glittering black eyes
she was evidently trying to persuade
him she was not at fault for the break-
ing out of the fire but he paid not the
slightest attention to her in the hands
of his followers were fire-extinguishers
incongruous modernities beside the odd
picturesque costumes the gesticulat-
ing crowd passed through without a
glance towards the screen behind which
lotus cowered

  now was her chance summoning all
her courage she crept out she believed
she must be on the ground floor she
must find her way out while the house-
hold was busy downstairs she noise-
lessly flitted through the small rooms
but if they contained windows they were
concealed beneath painted panels

  at last with a gasp of disappointed
astonishment she found herself within
the magnificent room which was wus
private apartment she looked about
vainly for some other passage of escape
so interested that she did not hear a
stealthy step creep up behind her

  so lotus bloom you tried to set my
house on fire my girls are set loose
some of them cannot be found my
men are smothering down beneath the
ground trying to put out the fire we
cannot call in the fire company for that
would reveal the secrets of my business
in a few moments more it would have
been beyond control and all chinatown
a blazing inferno and all due to the
most troublesome woman-fiend of the
devil god i have ever known you my
beautiful lotus bloom-

  it was wus voice malignant vibrant
with something more to be dreaded than
mere anger with a shriek lotus fled
from him towards the raised dais wu
followed her his purpose masked be-
neath his immobile features only his
eyes telling the tale choking lotus put
her hand up to her throat w ith a dead-
ly purpose in his eyes he followed her


the dragons claw

his gaze that of a tiger intent on its
prey

  i cant-i cant-dont touch me
she sobbed her nerves gone at last and
she screamed again as she saw those eyes
coming nearer the look in their depths
shriveling her soul his arms lithe as
steel closed about her fighting writh-
ing she fought him off her screams
echoing through the house

  wu was too intent upon his purpose
to notice he had not quite pushed the
screen back into place after his en-
trance but lotus saw the crack ami
redoubled her cries and then as wu
ilung her powerless back upon the dais
a hubbub of noises arose which brought
him partially to his senses half crazed
as he was

  lotus felt her strength going a deadly
faintness numbing her with one last
strangled cry she relaxed as the screen
was pushed back

  chin ling wu his face distorted like
that of a heathen god glanced over at
the intrusion a crowd of men stood in
the entrance with an ugly snarl wu
balked of his prey glared his defiance

  drop that girl or ill shoot

  wu impassively stared down the bar-
rel of a revolver as a couple of men
sprang forward and clapped handcuffs
on his yellow wrists the revolver
dropped and the man strode over to the
crumpled heap lying inert on the dais
one look at her face was enough for
ransom fuller to know that his search
was ended but lotus at sound of his
voice had fainted

  donaldson his thin keen face alert
turned from the tableau jotting down
memoranda for the big story which
would form the scoop headlines in the
mornings argtis from another part
of the house echoed the screams of the
native women as a plain-clothes man en-
tered holding a shrinking american girl
by each hand

         there any more girls in this
  place questioned haggerty

  one of the girls nodded six more
but we all got out when lotus set the
underground dens on fire she whim-
pered

  the divil she did theres a girl for
ye haggertys admiring glance swept
over the inert form on the dais over
which fuller was working to bring back
consciousness come on boys them
chinks is all down below fightin the
fire well round em all up and make a
clean sweep o this dive weve got tli
man weve been trailin the biggest divil
o them highbinders caught witbnth
goods on he scowled at wu who had
recovered his oriental impassivity
take him out and keep him safe in th
bubble-wagon while we run in the rest
hike along lively now

  as chin ling wu guarded on both
sides was hustled out of the room he
did not even throw a glance at the girl
who had been the cause of his downfall
donaldson had already disappeared with
haggerty and his men prepared tor a
clean sweep belowground

  with no thought for anything save
lotus salisbury fuller gently forced
some brandy from his pocket-flask be-
tween her lips the luxurious room
which had been the scene of so many
horrors was very still the atmosphere
surcharged with subtle undercurrents
with a long sigh lotus opened her eyes
staring straight up into the fine dark
face just above hers quite unvolition-
ally her arms crept about his neck as
fuller hungrily gathered her up to him

  youre not dead-youre not dead
she repeated faintly tell me-tell
me did they hurt you oh how ive
suffered thinking they had killed you
for my sake she shuddered trem-
bling

  you cared ilis face was alight
with an ardor wholly unprofessional

  so-so tnuch

  lotus gave a little upward tilt to her
chin and the next instant their lips met
with all the tenderness the starved long-
jack rowes



ing of elemental nature a number of
minutes later lotus sighing ecstatically
murmured in fullers ear

  how did you happen to find me
dearest i thought wu had his servants
murder you

  not a bit of it he didnt bother
with me-it was you he was after as
soon as you disappeared t got after the
police and my old friend donaldson and
we put the chinese guide through a
third-degree grilling but he was too
clever for us to get much information
out of him so we got permits to search
chinatown and donaldson who knows
it better than most white men and who
has had reason to suspect wu before
brought us here if we had not found
you we should have dynamited the wall
in the alley where you disappeared
there must be a passageway under it-

  there is thats where the girls are
imprisoned wu has a lot of under-
ground passageways running from be-
neath his cellar in different directions
they took me in through a door in the
alley-wall i saw it when we were on
the other side then they gave me
chloroform and-and i didnt remember
anything more until i woke up-down
there 

  her arms tensed about him again
they forgot the fears and terrors of the
past hours in the sweetness of the pres-
ent moment

  but they were rudely awakened from
their dream of bliss as a babel of
shrieks curses and howls from below
attested that haggertys men had been
successful in their clean-up lotus
clung to fuller in sudden terror

  oh take me away from here she
whispered i cant stand any more to-
night i hope the girls are all safely
out

  im sure of it soothed the man
theyll be under police protection until
their families arc notified what hap-
pened anyway how did you come to
be up here

  for the first time he realized lotus
was wearing chinese costume his fine
features darkened as certain possibilities
flashed across his mind lotus under-
stood and shivered

  i set fire to my cell hoping we might
get a chance to escape or else be killed
quickly she said so simply the horror
behind her words was doubly poignant
i couldnt live the life wu intended for
me and he wouldnt let me go and-i
think the greatest of all reasons why i
didnt care what became of me was be-
cause i-i believed you-were dead

  cheek to cheek she whispered the
last words in his ear for a long mo-
ment he held her close immovable then
helped her to her feet his eyes still
dim she leaned on his shoulder as he
threw an arm about her waist to steady
her

  she smiled at him tremulously you
see-how much i need you and her
shadowy eyes languorously lovely re-
vealed more than the words

  i intend to make myself so thorough-
ly necessary ill be absolutely indispens-
able his muscles tightened about her
suppleness to-morrow morning im
going to apply for a license i dont
know what the laws are here in frisco
but as soon as we can arrange it im go-
ing to take you away on a honeymoon to
coronado its a heavenly spot and
well forget all thats occurred here i
cant understand how youve come to
care for me im so happy myself i can
almost feel sorry for that other fellow
who has lost you-

  other fellow what arc you talk-
ing about i dont understand lotus
brows knit in perplexity

  the one youre engaged to he lift-
ed her unresisting left hand the
diamond winked up at him maliciously
the man in the picture on your dress-
ing-table he explained

  at the note of jealousy in his voice
lotus brow cleared she burst into a
clear ripple of hearty laughter


the dragons claw

  you thought i was engaged to john
whitney oh my dearest one of the
reasons i came on this trip was because
i wanted to see if  cared enough for
him to miss him when he was away from
me i havent-not a bit i felt sure i
didnt care for him in-in the right way
but lie-he wanted me to make sure i
have-now she glanced at fuller
shyly and this ring-her voice sank
tenderly-this was my mothers en-
gagement ring thats why i value it so
much perhaps i ought not wear it on
that finger to give a false impression
but ive always felt i couldnt let any
man take it off and-and replace it with
another until i was-sure it was a-
kind of guard against-the wrong man
you see

  slowly with lingering tenderness his
fingers dosed about the slender band
as he drew it off lotus looked in his
eyes a smile behind her tears slipping
the diamond upon her right hand he
drew an odd signet ring from his little
finger as the heavy circlet slid over
her slim third finger fuller lifted her
hand to his lipa

  until i can replace it to-morrow with
one more suitable he murmured

  once more the silence in the room
was intense then fuller lingericgly re-
leased lotus and this time they passed
through the house out into the narrow
street in front his runabout was wait-
ing at the comer lotus clad only in
her silken coat shivered as the chill
night air struck her hastily wrapping
her in a bulky thick motor-coat fuller
tucked her in beside him threw in the
clutch and they moved away from wus
house of hidden mysteries

  the pallor of approaching dawn was

in the sky and the streets were bleak and
deserted now that the glamor of the
swinging paper lanterns the lights twink-
ling from half open doorways were no
longer visible this bit of old china lost
its charm revealing itself in all its taw-
dry sordidness

  through the heart of the oriental sec-
tion then through the city itself fuller
drove at a speed impossible in the day-
time but before they reached the be-
ginning of the exposition grounds the
rising sun was casting its first gleam-
across the bay out beyond them to
the right the golden gate was spread-
ing its arms to welcome another day
across the amethystine waters in the
misty distance tamalpais flushed into
tawny crimson

  as they passed the tower of jewels
raising its slender head priceless gem nt
the exposition buildings the sunrise
kissed the countless rainbow-colored
crystals into prismatic glory fuller
slowed their speed

  seel lotus laid her hand on his
arm its the sunrise ransom a new
day how wonderfully those jewels
glow in the light-as though they were
warmed into life by the rays of the
rising sun and were glad to welcome it-
as we are

  the road was clear ahead under the
rainbow radiance fuller leaned down
and kissed her full on the lips her
cheeks rivaled the sunrise glow as he
echoed

  a new day our wedding-day lo-
tus the perfect dawn of a new life-
the life of fulfilment-

  together finished lotus softly as
the golden halo merged into the full
splendor of the new-born day
the strange tramp

by john w n sullivan

it was out in the connecticut hills that
i came upon the strange tramp

at first  was not even sure that
he was a tramp he sat with his back
against a tree his mouth open and his
eyes shut snoring like a new type of
orchestral instrument the tattered
remnants which constituted his conces-
sion to propriety were obviously the last
phase of a suit of harris tweed

  near him on the grass was the ob-
ject which made me pause a dainty
yellow-covered volume presented its
glaring black title at me-les fonctions
elliptiques

  in my youth i had won distinction in
the mathematical tripos but when i
found that a thorough mathematical
equipment has rather less market value
than a rudimentary acquaintance with
plumbing i abandoned its study the
volume lying on the grass had cost me
many headaches and i eyed the ragged
personage under the tree with consider-
able curiosity suddenly the bassoon
solo ceased and i perceived two black
eyes staring fixedly at me

  good afternoon said the tramp po-
litely

  good afternoon i replied the
weather is exceptionally warm for may
dont you think

  the tramp nodded briefly and yawned
he continued to stare at me fixedly with-
out manifesting the slightest interest
his rather refined very sunburnt face
was surmounted by a shock of black
hair he looked something over thirty
i perceived an old felt hat at the base
of the tree

  his treatment is very clear isnt it

i continued nodding at the book on the
grass

  not bad said the tramp with faint
disparagement but the notation is hope-
lessly old-fashioned

  he rose slowly to his feet placed his
hat on his head and his book under his
arm he eyed me a little quizzically

  are you coming along

  he waved an explanatory hand in a
general easterly direction and i fell into
step beside him

  yes its sufficiently rare to be a lit-
tle startling he said answering my un-
spoken thought but i am a tramp be-
cause i am logical

  just so just so i assented

  no he continued placidly not in
the least because i am mad originally
i admit i became a tramp by necessity
but i remain one because my knowledge
of philosophy is too great to allow me
to do anything else

  philosophy has much to answer for
i said gravely we walked a few steps
in silence

  of course if youre going to be
rude said the tramp a trifle wearily
i shall have to tell you the story of my
life

  i nodded encouragingly fire away
ive got about three miles to go and we
must talk about something

  he gazed dreamily at the few white
clouds which flecked the blue of the far
horizon it was a perfect day from a
cavity in what had once been a norfolk
jacket he produced a rather respectable
briar and taking the hint i handed him
my pouch

  he carefullv filled his pipe in silence




the strange tramp

and it was not until the first few clouds
of tobacco-smoke had floated out on the
still air that he commenced his story
he spoke with a faint flavor of serene
dogmatism and a certain precision of
phrase which reminded me singularly of
the lecture-room

  as you seem to have no particular
intelligence and have nevertheless done
some mathematics i take it you arc a
college man im one myself i went to
 larvard on a scholarship and special-
ized in mathematics because i had gen-
uine ability i really liked the stuff i
do now for the matter of that

  the strong bias some of us have for
the perfectly useless has never been sat-
isfactorily accounted for i murmured

  it is probable that i should never
have made a great reputation he went
on ignoring my interruption i am not
sufficiently emasculated to find all my
desires satisfied by tracing the vagaries
of x but one has to mortify the flesh
on six hundred a year he puffed med-
itatively you of course never had
less than four times that he turned
to me with a peculiar smile

  except when i was teaching i as-
sented reflectively

  he looked at me with some stern-
ness so youve actually done teach-
ing ah well there are shabby sins in
the lives of all of us though i suppose
he mused that deliberately to help a
system which militates against develop-
ment and survival is one of the shab-
biest his frown deepened you are
i hope a moral man he said severely

  er-a moral man yes i suppose
i could say i was a moral man

  he looked relieved

    it would be absurd to expect you to
see toy point of view were you not a
moral man the key to my whole posi-
tion is to be found in my exceptionally
acute moral sense all our social activi-
ties arc tainted i carmot work and pre-
serve my self-respect

     bernard shaw  i interpolated

  he looked affronted bernard shaw i
he repeated the name in a tone of con-
tempt my dear sir-really i hope i
go a little deeper than that bernard
shaw has not even a rudimentary ac-
quaintance with psychology or he would
not be a socialist no-really i may
say without vanity i am quite an in-
telligent man and-

  i beg your pardon i said humbly
i did not realize-

  quite so quite so he said airily
waving his hand with a gesture of com-
plete understanding his irritation in-
stantly appeased he puffed medita-
tively for a few seconds before he con-
tinued

  as i was saying i lived in cambridge
on a scholarship-six hundred per an-
num with my parents help i furnished
two rooms and i looked after myself
entirely-cooking my own meals making
my own bed and everything of course
i practised a rigid economy have you
ever tasted nut butter he asked sud-
denly

  i shook toy head

  its awful stuff but i almost came to
like it ive eaten worse since well i
didnt do so badly i was sufficiently a
fool to take an interest in poetry and
music not realizing that it i very un-
wise to cultivate the emotions on a
strictly counted income i hired a piano
at three dollars a month and saturated
myself in chopin and keats

  he eyed me critically are you
musical 

  i like music i replied ive never
studied it to any extent but im very
fond of listening to good music

  his face clouded ah well perhaps
youre better off he sighed ive
never quite decided whether a love of
music is a blessing or a curse

  but i do like music i insisted a lit-
tle impatient at his superior airs

  he nodded soothingly you think it
an agreeable recreation i have no doubt
you dont quite understand thats all
john w n sullivan



  i began to find him a little impossible
he resumed his faintly professorial
tone 

  my moods of reaction against the ab-
stract nature of my studies were at times
intense chopin in particular weak-
ened my power of self-control at times
i was a tingling mass of desire and i
could not afford to purchase gratifica-
tion there was obviously nothing for
it but to find a girl who was unconven-
tional or weak enough to be led-well
astray as they say

  there was a strange quality in the
voice which caused me to glance curi-
ously at the remarkable being at my side

  i found her without much difficulty
he continued and then paused

  i eyed him covertly as we walked on
in silence his mouth wore a sneer and
there was a hard look in his eyes he
stared straight in front of him and he
had ceased to smoke

  he broke out abruptly youve read
love and mr lewisham of course
his query was put with that apparent
inconsequence i had noticed before

  of course i answered

  its a very disappointing book have
you got a match  my pipe is out

  i handed him a box of matches

  yes he continued shielding the
lighted match with his hands and puffing
vigorously the end of the book is ab-
surd with no degree and no experi-
ence lewisham could never have made
enough for himself to say nothing of his
wife he put my matches in his pocket
i saw that so clearly that i refused to
marry the girl

  i shook my head doubtfully its
hardly right

  right he shouted and stopped in
his stride to face me he glared at me
furiously is it right do you think to
condemn two people to lifelong misery
in deference to the idiotic conventions of
the feeble-minded he flourished his
pipe excitedly what sort of morality
is that he snarled

  well of course- i was amazed at
this outburst

  yes of course he repeated peo-
ple like you are not moral you are only
superstitious what do you think mo-
rality is ill tell you he went on
without waiting for a reply its a code
of action which suits the convenience of
the greatest number there is  other
definition which will hold water for a
moment he glared hostility for a
space

  and so i refused to marry the girl
he repeated

  i maintained surprised silence and
with an impatient wave of his hand he
resumed more calmly

  but i had to leave the college i had
enemies and they were bound to find
out there was one beast in particular
he said venomously a flabby-minded
literary person who was troubled by a
conscience the swine

  the last vestige of his detached man-
ner had vanished it was evident his
memories were very vivid

  and so you became a tramp i re-
marked

  what else was there to do it was
a choice between that and the humilia-
tion and wretchedness of an inferior
teaching job i did not hesitate as a
tramp i can at least preserve my self-
respect

  you prefer chopping wood for a
meal i asked

  certainly-not that i always chop
wood he said with a slight resentment
you would be astonished at some of the
experiences t have had for instance
i have sometimes got a meal and even a
bed as well for playing the piano

  for playing the piano i echoed

  yes youd be surprised some of the
better-class houses it has appealed to
their sense of the incongruous tramps
who play beethoven and chopin are not
common and it keeps me in practice
im quite well known in certain dis-
tricts


tiie strange tramp

  do you ever give lectures in mathe-
matics i inquired sarcastically

  not exactly he retorted placidly
but i once got bed and board for a week
from an amateur astronomer for helping
him with his computations he had
quite a decent little observatory

   do you give many recitals in this dis-
trict  pursued

  his frown caine back no im here
for a quite different purpose

    looked interrogation

  you see he answered with an air
of lucidity the girl never had a child
nothing happened i took care to keep
in touch indirectly you know 
indeed i said surprised but
what-

  exactly there are two alternatives
she may have been mistaken thats
quite possible you know or she may
have read thomas hardy i hardly
think her natural depravity would be suf-
ficient you remember-jue tie ob-
scure you know

   i looked puzzled

  a girl lies about it she thinks the
man is bound to marry her then

  oh i see i said suddenly compre-
hending and you think-

  t dont know said the tramp
thoughtfully then with an absurd
lapse into his stilted manner my sci-
entific training renders unsolved prob-
lems utterly repugnant to me as a mat-
ter of purely intellectual interest i wish
to find out the facts of the case

  he seemed very concerned that i
should make no mistake and it was with
an almost anxious air he awaited mv
response

  and how do you propose to find
out i asked

  im going to ask her he answered
resolutely i heard quite casually that
she was in new london and i shall trust
to chance to meet her

   dont you think it a trifle brutal i
suggested you have no feeling for the
girl and presumably she loves you

  he turned on me angrily what docs
that matter is it possible you are chiv-
alrous shades of nietzsche

  oh thats all bosh you know i
said a trifle hotly nietzsche was mad
women are not angels but they are hu-
man beings

  youre married i suppose he
sneered yes yes i know what you
would say you are happier so you
think perhaps you are but it is only
by refusing to face the facts he be-
came precise women are clogs and
burdens they are entirely unscru-
pulous and utterly deceitful they are 
disagreeable necessities for the contin-
uance of the race

  i burst out laughing the final result
of philosophy i mocked the ripened
fruit of the tree of wisdom

 he assumed a bored air your
method of debate is somewhat fatigu-
ing

  we walked on in silence to judge
from his face the tramp was plunged
in gloomy meditation and i was content
to think him over for a space it so hap-
pens that  have a very high opinion of
women largely based on my three years
experience of married life i could not
for an instant believe in the sincerity of
the tramps views and i was convinced
that an ordinary decent woman could
change his ideas in a very short time
with the bottom knocked out of that
part of his absurd philosophy it was
probable that the rest would go and
that the tramp would cease to remain a
tramp that i confess seemed to me
a desirable result in spite of his ridic-
ulous pose i found something likable
about him and i was persuaded he was
a man of genuine ability i conceived
the idea of presenting him to my wife

i would offer to employ him for a week

i felt convinced by a sort of instinct that
something more than curiosity prompted
the tramps search for the girl lie had
deserted i am no great believer at any
time in the spirit of disinterested curi-
john w n sullivan



os it even in men of science i have
been a scientific man in my thoughts
the tramps immediate future began to
assume an almost idyllic form when i
found that we had arrived within half a
mile of new london

  i motioned towards a large red-brick
house on my right and addressed the
tramp

  i hope youll come in and have some
lunch with me i should like to hear
more of your way of looking at things
he stared at me doubtfully

  i should like to find her to-night if
possible

  ohf thats all right i replied heart-
ily theres heaps of time and i may
be able to help you

  youre very kind he said politely

  i ushered him into the library as be-
ing the cosiest room in the house and
the most likely to interest him his first
proceeding was to inspect my books
which he did with the famished eager-
ness of an educated man who had been
too long without them he kept up a
running fire of questions and comments
showing the oddest preferences and dis-
tastes and yet withal a keenness of in-
sight and a breadth of reading which
somewhat astonished me prepared
though i was to find him possessed of
unusual attainments he was in the
midst of a caustic comment on mr
chestertons habit of thought when the
door opened and my wife appeared

  i thought i heard you come in jim
she said and-

  she suddenly caught sight of my com-
panion who was standing with his back
towards her at the sound of her voice
the tramp swung round and faced her
let me introduce-

  my wife suddenly swayed and gripped
the door-handle till her knuckles showed
white i had not allowed for the effect
the sudden sight of my ragged and un-
kempt visitor would have upon her

  i moved towards her and she almost
fell into my arms

  good god exclaimed the tramp
and let mr chestertons orthodoxy
fall with a thud to the floor

   its all right i said to him over my
shoulder my wife is a little nervous
but-come come dear i continued for
she was trembling excessively what
a nervous little tiling it is the gentle-
man is a visitor dear

  a visitor she gasped

  yes i went on its hardly com-
plimentary-

  she disengaged herself from my arms
with a nervous little laugh

  its very silly of me she confessed
but for the moment i thought- she
turned to the tramp with a little smile
but with a lurking fear still in her eyes
i really must apologize mr-er-
osborne said the tramp eying her
intently for my wife is a beautiful
woman and her confusion served only
to heighten her charm

  well now thats all right i said
heartily mr osborne is staying to
lunch with us my dear and perhaps
afterwards we can have a little music-
i should like you to hear my wifes play-
ing i broke off to remark to the tramp

  he smiled slightly so your wife is
a musician he said pleasantly with a
faint inflection of surprise in his voice

  you shall judge after lunch i re-
plied

  oh i dont suppose mr osborne will
consider me a musician said my wife
with a certain defiance for some rea-
son she seemed to have taken a dislike
to the tramp

  well well i said let us see about
something to eat

  ill see to it myself remarked my
wife and walked out of the room

  my wife is rather easily upset t
said half apologetically for i was anx-
ious she should make a good impression
on the tramp

  quite so he said politely my un-
expected appearance was doubtless some-
thing of a shock to her


the strange tramp

  you do look-er-somewhat uncon-
ventional i laughed

  precisely he said he regarded me
curiously he seemed on the point of
making a remark and then changed his
mind he walked to the window and
looked out on the lawn

  i suppose i said lightly that by
your philosophy i am to be pitied i
am hopelessly in the toils i am being
relentlessly dragged down-down from
the giddy heights of perfect egoism to
the level of an ordinary happy man

  are you happy said the tramp ab-
ruptly still looking out of the window

  i am so entirely deceived as to be-
lieve i am i replied laughing

  you have doubtless been married a
long time he said

  no i replied i first met mv wife
about three years ago we met quite
accidentally while i was on a vacation
trip through the st lawrence within a
month we were married she was an
orphan and there were no relatives to
be consulted she was companion to the
lady with whom she was traveling and
there were no other ties oh i assure
you my conduct was most unphilo-
sophical

  the tramp turned and faced me with
a strange smile

  it was he said slowly

  at the sound of the gong we moved
to the dining-room

  the tramp at first appeared somewhat
abstracted but after his second chop he
started to talk he talked extremely
well and in spite of her aversion i
found my wife listening to him with an
altogether unusual air of interest but
ever and again as she glanced at him
a look something akin to fear would leap
into her eyes there was evidently
something about the man which affected
her unpleasantly

   he tramp noticed this but he seemed
quite unconcerned and appeared indeed
to derive some peculiar cynical satisfac-
tion from it i felt disappointed at the

evident antagonism between them for i
had quite expected my wifes charm to
convert the tramp into something more
human but her most unexpected antip-
athy to my guest doomed this hope to
disappointment it was with a feeling
of relief on my part that we made our
way to the drawing-room

  now we will have some music i
said cheerily my wife has only taken
up piano-plaving of recent years i con-
tinued turning to the tramp who
nodded but i think you will agree that
she may rightly be called a musician   
what will you play dear-something
cheerful

  whatever you choose dear said my
wife and seated herself at the piano
with a sort of defiance

  during lunch the sky had rapidly been
growing overcast and now the first low
roll of thunder announced the coming
storm the heavy pattering of the rain
supplied an accompaniment to mv wifes
playing and the bright and sparkling
cascades of notes that rippled from under
her fingers formed a strange contrast to
the gathering fury of the elements

  the tramp seemed strangely excited
during the playing at its conclusion he
remarked harshly

  you should have played beethoven
play the appassionata

  i cant said my wife and then ab-
ruptly 

  will you

  they looked each other squarely in the
eyes and then without a word the tramp
took the place my wife vacated at the
piano it was soon evident that the
tramp had not boasted of his musical
ability without cause he played like a
man inspired perhaps the thunderous
accompaniment of the storm was partly
responsible for it but never before had
music so profoundly affected me as for
my wife she sat like a woman in a trance
music always greatly excited her but as
t watched her tense and rigid figure her
flushed cheeks and her glowing eyes

fixed with an almost terrible intenlness
on the tramp i could not blit heave a
sigh of relief at the final crashing chord
which brought the last movement of that
tremendous sonata to its close

  for a space there was silence then
the tramp turned to me

  listen i am going to play some- 
thing very special he looked at me
i am going to tell you a lot of things
lie said

  what said my wife loudly

  he spoke very deliberately

  a lot of things-on the piano he
added with a curious smile

  his smile changed to a mocking laugh

  a sort of song without words he
said to my wife

  i could never describe the effect upon
me of that next performance i am not
perhaps very sensitive to music but in
that piece i saw something i think of
what great music may mean to a musi-
cian he started with a dreamy tender
melody a very beautiful iove-song
which changing to a minor key became
transformed to something at once plead-
ing and pathetic it suggested coldness
and desolation and the sense of a great
loss bravely borne and then again it
changed and the first theme crept back
becoming more and more richly orna-
mented and gradually working up to a
glorious climax of passionate love i
was greatly moved and i saw that there
were tears in my wifes eyes and then
just as the passionate love-theme seemed
changing into a great paan of triumph
there rang out a crashing discord cyn-
ical brutal dominating against the love-
theme which strove ever more faintly
to overcome that fiendish chorus the
effect was so unexpected that i started
in my chair and my wife gripped her
hands convulsively and as the notes
flew faster and faster and the music be-
came more wild and terrible i saw the
face of the tramp change till it became
the face of a man in hell beads of
perspiration stood out on his brow knd

it was with a wild yell that he reached
the final climax simultaneously with
the cessation of the music my wife fell
in a tumbled heap on the floor

  i started to my feet but the tramp was
by her side before me

  fetch water he barked and mechan-
ically i turned and went as i entered
the room with the water the tramp raised
his head hurriedly he had been bend-
ing close over her face

  its only a faint he said shortly and
rose to his feet

  i knelt down and started to sprinkle
my wifes hands and forehead

  bring me a cushion for her head i
said over my shoulder

  there was no answer i screwed my
head round the tramp had gone

  my wife stirred feebly jim she
moaned

  she opened her eyes and looked into
my face whats the matter jim she
whispered

  you fainted my dear i said

  she struggled to a sitting posture

  and the other man-the tramp she
said glancing fearfully around

  hes gone i said soothingly

  she gave a sob of relief and hid her
face on my breast

  suddenly she looked up but the
storm she said and he had no coat

  hes a strange man dear i said
gravely i think im glad hes gone

  she scanned my face for a moment
im very glad hes gone she drew
my face down and kissed me

  i have never seen the strange tramp
since apparently he did not remain in
new london for some reason he ap-
pears to have abandoned his search and
he is probably still tramping the country
wasting his powers in defense of an ab-
surd philosophy there was something
about the man which attracted me i
feel sure there w-as more in him than i
understood and that at the bottom he
had in him the makings of a man my
	the woman habit

 wife does not like to discuss him he ished by his lonely and wandering life
 certainly had a low opinion of women as an old greek has said an unbe-

 womans truth and loyalty is fitly pun- gods

  the woman habit

   by john lynch

      love is after all largely a function of nature

   

      the love of a courtesan is like a badly cooked dinner that satisfies ones hun-
 ger but leaves one filled with disgust

   

     to be known as a cynic and a woman-hater is to be despised by men toler-
 ated bv women and adored by young girls

   

     if men treated their mistresses as they do their wives immorality woul l
 go out of fashion for want of candidates

   

     if woman must be censured for having commercialized love man must be
 held blamable for having made the enterprise profitable

   

     primitive man found love so absorbing that he instituted marriage to give
 him a chance to think of other things

   

      no man can be argued into fidelity but most men can be cajoled into it

     

     when a woman becomes an expert in love she may continue to inspire it
 but her day for loving is over

   

     if men were permitted to have two wives one would not bear the-slightest
 resemblance to the other

   

     a woman who boasts of her virtue either fears or hopes that it may be

 lost

   

     god proved himself a humorist when he made man and confirmed the fact
 when he made woman

   

     to be happy with a perfectly innocent man a woman must be endowed
 with glorious memories or with inexhaustible hopes

   

     the secret of happiness in marriage is not to get too well acquainted

              	 

     marry while you are young you wili know unhappiness but you will get a
 sp at the spring of life while it bubbles

              	 

     at seventy all that most men demand is something feminine
a professional husband

                by harold vickers

tou actually want to employ me
as a-a husband

            sinton stared at the girl in
frank amazement she was not exactly
pretty though her figure was distinctly
good and her face if not of the even
insipid charm beloved of those artists
who create magazine cover-designs was
not without its attractiveness especially
when the cheeks flamed as they did now
under his startled gaze

  that is it-exactly her voice was
level even but her bosom rose and fell
a trifle too swiftly for complete com-
posure and her lingers interlaced nerv-
ously in her lap he stared again his
mind a little stunned by the unexpected
proposal to respond to an advertise-
ment calling for a gentleman possessing
unusual tact discretion and honor for
a mission of delicacy is naturally to be
prepared for something out of the com-
mon but he had not dreamed of any-
thing so extraordinary as this he had
a momentary impulse to refuse point-
blank but something in the girls face
made him resist it he realized that he
distinctly wished to be of service to her
and sensed that she would assuredly not
have conceived her fantastic plan with-
out desperately sound reason for it

  why not let me understand the case
altogether he suggested kindly i
do not wish to pry but if i am to con-
sider a proposal so remarkable i must
know something of its details-and if
you are prepared to repose in me the
vast confidence required by your plan
you may surely trust me with the ex-
planation

  she studied him doubtfully he was

obviously a gentleman she had realized
that at once she saw now that his
clothes though tastefully chosen and ad-
mirably cut were worn and already a
little shabby but his face invited faith
-a strong honest likable countenance
she thought it and his level blue eyes
met hers with a frank open question in
them which her womans intuition bade
her answer

  if i tell you will you promise to
help me she fenced i dont dare
to explain unless im sure-

  i cant promise unconditionally he
interrupted as she paused for a word
but if what you ask is within the pos-
sibilities i think you may count on me
try me at all events and if i cannot do
as you wish i can at least hold my peace
as to your confidence

  have you ever been in deptford
she demanded irrelevantly he shook
his head

  i never even heard of it

  you-you havent lived here long
as i said in my letter ive lived most
of my life in peru my father was a
mining engineer there i came up here
six months ago hoping to find a busi-
ness connection which would support
me but the export trade is overcrowded
im practically penniless friendless and
hopeless-which is why your advertise-
ment interested me

  then no one here would be likely
to know you

  no one here could possibly know
me he was positive on the point six
months of job-hunting had made him
sure of so much at least

  she took a sudden decision ill




a professional husband

risk it she cried i live in deptford
-its two hundred miles up-state-a
dead-and-alive little town exactly like
hundreds and hundreds of others i m
the ugly duckling in a big family-all the
others are pretty and popular i hey all
married young-and well as such things
go in deptford i didnt nobody ever
looked at me they elected me as the
family spinster when i was fifteen and
ive been aunt ethel poor homely
hopeless aunt ethel ever since do you
realize what that means in a town like
deptford 

  t can guess he smiled sympathet-
ically our colony in pasco wasnt very
large you know people are very much
alike the world around

  well i endured it for years and
years and years-until it seemed as if i
couldnt stand it another minute and
when by some miracle a man-an ac-
tual live man-did look twice at me i
didnt stop to ponder it all that mat-
tered was that i was going to escape
from deptford and involuntary aunt-
hood at last when this-this man sug-
gested that i run away and marry him
secretly i-i agreed i had some money
-i forgot to say that were pretty well
off at least according to the deptford
standard-and i packed a bag and left
a note saying simply that i was going to
traybany to be married that was all
i wanted it to stun them you see-no
warning no explanations just the blunt
announcement

   it would stun them ill admit he
smiled what then 

   she hesitated flushing again well
i met him at traybany and in ten min-
utes i realized what  was doing but
it was ten minutes too late he-he was
wholly impossible but i knew id
burned my bridges i had to stand by
it then so i wired them at home that
i was married and on my way to new
york for my honeymoon my honey-
moon she was silent her face hard
and bitter her eyes glowing

  i-im very sorry

  she smiled her pathetic gratitude for
the trite remark and sinton realized
that her smile was distinctly appealing
it seemed to lighten her face like the
sudden glow of a friendly lamp

  so i intended to stay on here letting
them back in deptford think that it
was all right but i might have known
that wouldnt do-they were all con-
vinced that id made a fool of myself
over some fortune-hunter-exactly as i
had and my uncle who is also my guard-
ian and trustee refuses to supply me
with money unless he is convinced that
im not wasting it on a worthless hus-
band he says that if my husband cant
support me id better come home and if
my husband can support me why should
i need money

  but he has no right to hold back
your own funds protested sinton

  no but you see he thinks its his
duty to protect me and thats one way
of doing it ive either got to produce
a satisfactory husband to set his mind
at rest or else go back to deptford in
disgrace to be pitied and sighed over
the rest of my days

  i see and if your husband satisfies
your people they will have  objection
to giving you your property and letting
you go away with him-is that -it
yes of course id take pains to
go far enough away so that none of
them would be likely to visit me and
after a year or two id write them that
he was dead or something and come
home if i wanted to you sec the only
way i can get my money otherwise is
by making a fuss which will show them
all just what a fool ive been and i
wont do that i wont be pitied and
patronized and-and auntied all my
days ill starve first

  then all id have to do would be
to play the part of husband for a brief
time and so convince your relatives of
my good character that theyll trust you
with me-is that it
harold vickers



  yes of course ill provide every-
thing you need to-to impress them-
clothes and things you know and i-
ill be able to pay you very well as soon
as i get my money its quite a lot-
for deptford

  sinton flushed in his turn he was
acutely conscious of his sartorial defi-
ciencies but every fibre of him rebelled
at repairing them at a womans expense
she seemed to sense his thought

  you mustnt take offense she said
quickly its no disgrace to be hard
up-goodness knows ill be soon if you
dont help me of all the letters i re-
ceived in answer to my advertisement
yours was the only one i dared to fol-
low up if you wont help me ill just
have to-

  ill do it sinton came quickly to
his decision well show your people
that they were all wrong about you
and ill endeavor to put up an appear-
ance which will turn your sisters green
with envy ive always thought id
make a jolly good actor

  she beamed on him oh thank you
i hoped you would you seemed a-a
sort of answer to prayer when you came
in she sobered suddenly and glanced
at him with a pathetically wistful appeal
in her eyes i wonder if youd mind-
seeming-seeming very fond of me
she asked timidly not-not just dis-
tantly friendly yju know but-

  sinton smiled i think i can man-
age that too he said

  no sir lncle henry hinkle titu-
lar head of the clan and financial despot
of deptford shook his head to empha-
size his words i dont put much faith
in appearances you look all right but
im not going to trust my nieces happi-
ness to a stranger just on account of
looks no nor yet her money

  sinton reddened a little at the implied
insult in spite of his determination to
face the situation with imperturbable
good-nature ytour interest in ethel

does you credit sir he said quietly
as to her money that is none of mv
affair

  uncle henry leaped at the opening af-
forded by this indiscreetly chivalrous re-
mark then you dont care whether
she gets control of her funds at once or
jater onhe demanded quickly his
keen old eyes glittering under their
shaggy brows sinton cursed his folly
roundly to himself but answered with-
out perceptible hesitation

  i want ethel to have her rights of
course he said if her money is due
her now as i understand it is i want
her to have it i can take care of her
of course but she naturally wishes to
have her own funds and i want her to
have whatever she wants that is my
position

  im i see uncle henrys voice
was dry well it aint mine-yet
ethel doesnt know whats good for her
and i do i dont know a thing about
you you may be any sort of a rascal
so far as i can tell i may not have any
right to hang on to her money but i
guess youll find ive got the power try
suing me here in deptford and see what
you get

  sinton realized that he was endanger-
ing the success of the whole plan he
forced himself to speak evenly i have
no intention of dragging family matters
into the courts he said nor has
ethel we have come here merely to
satisfy your natural curiosity regarding
myself i have already explained to you
who i am and what i am you have
had an opportunity to look me over and
form your opinion for yourself if that
is not sufficient ethel will have to get
along without her money until you are
convinced that it is safe to trust her with
it put in that case she will harbor a
natural belief that she has been unjustly
treated and perhaps conceive suspicions
as to your motives

  my motives lncle henry bristled
what does that mean
a professional husband

  sinton realized that he had struck the
right note he laughed apologetically
im afraid she thinks that your reluc-
tancc is due in part to a desire to con-
tinue in control of her money that pos-
sibly it is of use to you to be able to
make her investments and so on of
course she has said nothing about this
to anv one except me-as yet but

  thats fine that is uncle henry
fumed my own niece thinking im a
crook and all because im looking out
for her interests

  you cant blame her said sinton
and so far she hasnt said anything to
anybody else about it but of course
shes likely to talk sooner or later
women are built that way- of course
your reputation here can stand it
though

   guess it can but uncle henry
knew that it could not one does not
do a big business in second-mortgages
and chattel ioans in a farming commu-
nity without acquiring a certain repute
for unsavory motives a considerable
number of people would joyfully believe
the worst of uncle henry and that
astute citizen knew that a rumor of this
sort would spread swiftly until it brought
depositors into the hinkle bank to with-
drew their funds he temporized

  look here he proposed his manner
changing a little i- dont want hard
feelings in the family all im after is
to be sure that rou want ethel for her-
self and not her money i want to make
certain that shell be happy with you
now heres my offer you stay here
with us for a little while-a week or
two or three maybe-and give me a
chance to see how you get on the
minute i m satisfied ill turn her prop-
erty oyer to her without a word ill
lpave it to you if that aint fair

  sinton thought quickly he was
forced to admit that it was more than
fair from uncle henrys point of view
but to spend a week or more in the
hinkle homestead on terms of matri-

monial intimacy- it would be a situ-
ation not wholly pleasing to ethel he
felt sure he had already seen enough
of the hinkle regime to realize that the
customs of the household were decidedly
free from any taint of metropolitan ar-
tificiality for a moment he thought of
rejecting the proposal but two influences
deterred him to refuse would be to
confirm every half-formed suspicion on
the part of this shrewd old man and so
nuliify the object of the masquerade
and a sudden distaste for parting abrupt-
ly from ethel completed the argument
for the affirmative

  it is fair he conceded ill be glad
to stay on here until youre satisfied
sir and though i think ethel will prob-
ably regret interrupting her wedding-
journev i feel sure shell be willing
too

  good uncle henry sighed with
relief then thats all settled ill
just call up the house and tell martha
to fix up the front room for you its
the brides room you know-all the girls
have had it when they came home from
their honeymoons

 room and for a stay of weeks
sinton wondered what ethel would say
when she knew as for himself hewas
surprised to discover how easily he rec-
onciled himself to the prospect

  this is terrible ethel glanced
about the room desper ely she bad
contrived to conceal her feelings through
the evening after uncle henrys trium-
phant announcement at the supper-tawe
but sinton had detected her perturbation
easily enough and had found in the
glance which she turned toward him
again and again a certain dawning of
distrust if not of fear

  it cant be helped he said calmly
slipping the bolt in the door and draw-
ing her toward the window that their
whispered conversation might not be
overheard outside the room if id of-
fered any objection hed have made you
harold vickers



fight for your money through every
court this was positively the only way
to satisfy him and after all its not
impossible you know we were on
pretty thin ice anyway-this doesnt
complicate the situation very much

  she flashed an angry look at him
not very much she repeated hotly
under her breath how can we occupy
one room for weeks and weeks and not
complicate the situation its im-
possible-i wont go on with it ill tell
them the whole story and make them put
you out i thought you were a gentle-
man 

  he flushed but refused to lose his
temper i try to be he said quietly
dont leap at conclusions please its
embarrassing for you i know but its
better than being made a laughing-stock
for the whole town isnt it better than
continuing to be treated as a pitiful
spinster unfit to handle your own
money better than-

  oh youre hateful she sobbed sud-
denly giving way to tears how could
you put me in such a position either
way im disgraced theres no escape

  there has been no escape from that
danger since the moment you ran away
he told her it will only make things
vastly worse to confess the deception
now your only chance is to bluff this
thing through with me i thought it all
out before i agreed to it you may be
sure

  she shook the tears from her eyes
and faced him proudly defiantly

  yes thats true ill be disgraced
forever if  tell nobody will believe
anything but the worst of me but ill
know better ill know that ive done
nothing wrong and id rather have
that knowledge than gain protection
from scandal at the price of knowing
that i have-have done something of
which to be-to be ashamed

  he was very patient my dear girl
theres no question of being ashamed or
of wrong-doing he said if we hap-

pen to occupy the same room it doesnt
require us to be sinners unless we
choose does it ive tried to protect
you throughout this affair and im not
going to change my course now-you
may be quite sure of that

  she stared at him then her eyes
wandered about the room desperately as
if seeking an escape from the hopeless
situation but-but-but she stam-
mered helplessly you cant-you cant
possibly stay here-

  he smiled why not ive often
spent weeks at a time in native huts
where the whole family ate and slept in
the same room i dont see the differ-
ence except that this room is consider-
ably larger and happens to be equipped
with a comfortable couch on which i
shall sleep vastly better than i used to
on the clay floor of the native chuco
t know its a bit difficult for you-youve
been brought up to confuse appearances
with facts-but youll find its not so
bad come-youve trusted me pretty
far already trust me a little farther
she studied him what she read in
his frank eyes seemed to reassure her
her own ceased to be wide with fright
and gradually brightened you-you
dont think im-im a bad woman
then she asked softly you dont im-
agine that because i ran away to get
married and then ran away from the
man im-im the kind of girl that
doesnt care-

  he laughed outright at her earnest-
ness but there was a touch of sympathy
and admiration in his mirth my dear
child i dont think anything about it-
i knoxv what you are and its because
i do know it that im trying so hard to
shield you from the consequences of
your recklessness you cant fancy that
this sort of thing is exactly pleasant for
me can you

  isnt it she surveyed him in lat-
ent surprise i-i thought all men
would- she flushed under his swiftly-
changing gaze and could not finish her


a professional husband

sentence he was silent for a moment
before lie answered bis voice almost
tender

  your ideas are partially sound he
said all men-including me-are in-
stinctively brutes a cad would revel in
this situation because his instincts and
his intentions would agreeably coincide
a gentleman-and you remember that
 endeavor to be one so far as in me lies
-a gentleman must strangle those same
brute instincts by sheer force of will
its not exactly pleasant for me

  she was instantly penitent forgive
me-i didnt understand i thought that
either you didnt intend to-to strangle
those-those instincts or else you didnt
find me worth getting excited about i
see how you feel now and im sorry
and more grateful than i can tell you

  he turned his back on her abruptly
it dawned upon him suddenly that she
was vastly more alluring than he had
thought that as she stood there her face
flushed with her emotions her eyes in-
nocent and admiring the artless admis-
sion that it mattered to her to know
that he did not find her unalluriug still
on her lips the temptation to fling
scruples to the winds and sweep her into
his arms was all but overpowering lie
foresaw a difficult fortnight before their
enterprise should succeed

  well have to get used to the idea
of using this room together he said
tonelessly after a pause can you-
manage without the lamp it will be
easier if we can make the darkness
serve as a wall

  of course but there was a touch
of regret in her voice as she assented
he quickly extinguished the light and
crossed to the window so that she might
see him silhouetted vaguely against the
dim illumination which penetrated the
shade from the street-lamps outside
standing there in the gloom he could
hear the faint whisper of fabrics as she
made ready for ihe night the sound of
her brush as she arranged her hair the

  soft thud of her pumps on the rug he
clenched his hands fiercely it was go-
ing to be worse than his apprehensions
had painted it-this fortnight of pre-
tense

  here-here arc some blankets lie
heard the fall of a bare foot close behind
him as the words came timidly to his
ears and turned to accept the burden
their hands touched as he took it and
a sharp electric thrill sped along his taut
nerves at the accidental contact he
caught her own indrawn gasp and knew
that she shared to an extent the tension
which held him rigid as though with a
paralysis of all his muscles

  thanks he said hoarsely good
night

  good night he heard her patter
across the room to her bed and then the
involuntary gasp as she slipped between
the cold linen sheets for a long time
he continued to stand at the window
holding his bundle of blankets in his
arms and struggling with the impulses
which most sharply produce the nice dis-
tinction between a man and a brute
then removing his outer clothing lest
its appearance suffer from nocturnal us-
age he wrapped the blankets about him
and flung himself down on the couch to
lie awake until the gray light of the
morning came through the eastern win-
dows only then did he venture so much
as a glance toward the sleeping girl

  she was utterly adorable in the art-
less innocence of sleep her dark hair
framing the oval of her face against the
background of pillows one rounded arm
lying above the coverlet her cheek rest-
ing on the palm of the other hand it
came upon him in that moment of un-
derstanding that this was the one wom-
an of his life the one woman who had
made it unthinkable that there should
be another in the wide world for him
and in the same instant he knew that
for all the empty formality of it she
would not be his so long as even the emp-
tiest of formalities bound her to the
harold vickers



scoundrel she had technically married
when she woke he had gone to face the
clumsy witticisms of uncle henry an-
other early riser concerning the bad
taste of bridegrooms whose thoughts
turned ungallantly toward the buckwheat
cakes of breakfast

  i wish youd fix things up so as to
stay right here in deptford ed why
the wagon works would be a regular
mint if youd just take charge i never
thought there was a chance of selling
the hinkle cart abroad till you up and
proved it eight thousand dollars worth
of em in two weeks think of it

  uncle henry hinkle looked up from
the sheaf of export orders to beam ap-
proval on his newest nephew he was
not in the habit of praising without more
than due cause sinton had earned the
approval and more it had been a re-
lief to plunge into the task of enlighten-
ing his supposititious brothers-in-law on
certain simple mysteries of export dur-
ing his forced sojourn in deptford and
luck had favored him a huge commis-
sion house in new york had discovered
in the hinkle cart exactly what its
foreign clients needed and uncle henry
was already deep in plans for the speedy
enlargement of the factory which was
one of the several family enterprises

  i wish i could said sinton but its
quite impossible im afraid ive got
too much to do elsewhere he made
the excuse mechanically but its falsity
almost amused him except for his
wages from ethel-which he wras
firmly resolved not to accept-he would
leave deptford penniless and jobless to
resume the struggle for sustenance with
only a new trouble to reward his efforts
in the girls behalf for the knowledge
which had come to him in that first
night had deepened as the days went by
and more wakeful nights of vain long-
ing followed on their heels it had be-
come an endless pain merely to see the
girl as she went about the old house at

  her resumed housewifely duties to hear
the voice which had become so strangely
musical in his ears to meet the eyes
which glanced at him ever and again with
something of his own desire mirrored in
their depths and the nights were night-
mares-endless hours of struggle against
-his surging love for her broken by in-
tervals of sleep in which she haunted his
dreams

  well i suppose thats so uncle
henry was saying regretfully couldnt
hardly expect a business-man like you
to tie himself down in a town like dept-
ford tf it would do any good id offer
you a third interest in the works to stay
on and run em for us ethels got a
third anyway and id hang on to the
other for all im worth with you in
control why dont you think it over

  sinton knew that a third interest in
the concern would mean an income far
beyond anything he might hope to earn
for years to come he knew that he could
build up the sales so that the works
would make him rich before he was
ready to retire but he could not reach
out to grasp the opportunity which
chance flung in his way for him there
was no possibility of remaining in dept-
ford-ethel had put that out of the
question there could be no means of
clearing up the impossible situation so
that he could stay it was inconceivable
that he should go on enduring the tor-
ture of her nearness of the mockery of
marriage in which he spent the endless
nights there was no help for it as
soon as ethel had control of her money
they must go-and separate sometimes
he thought of that reparation as a desert
wanderer dreams of a cooling spring-
it seemed as though anything must be
preferable to the agony of denied desire
but nearly always he dreaded it even
more than he dreaded the present  he
thought of losing her was harder to face
now than the thought of living with her
yet apart from her

   ill talk it over with ethel he said


a professional husband

at last by the way i suppose youre
satisfied as to-as to my intentions and
motives by this time

   uncle henry chuckled im not say-
ing a word about that till after youve
talked it over with ethel maybe i
could keep you here by refusing to let
her have her own way you see her
about it and let me know

   sinton contrived to smile for all the
old mans banter he knew the fight was
won the task accomplished ethels
uncle trusted him more than enough now
to turn over the girls money to her
and he might go when he chose-the
torture of being near to her and yet
barred from her need not endure for
another day if he so willed he rose
and left the office for the rest of the
afternoon he wandered along the bleak
roads fighting his battle with himself
he could not make up his mind to go
on with the hideous farce of pretending
to be married to the girl he wanted with
ever fibre of his being still less could
he decide to put her altogether from his
life when he came home for the sup-
per to which uncle henry still clung
instead of the modern institution of an
evening dinner he was still undecided
and ethls bridelike welcome only added
to his doubt somehow he endured the
evening it seemed an age before ethel
bade her uncle good night and waved a
hand to her husband when they were
alone together he made up his mind to
speak but he could not

   i need the light edgar she said as
he would have extinguished it i cant
fix ray hair properly unless i can see

  he made no comment his back
toward her he stared at the wall he
mould not turn not even when she called
his name-called it in a tone which set
his pulses throbbing giddily

   well t his tone was almost gruff
there was a slight pause and her voice
was hurt when she spoke again

   you-you dont care the least little
bit do you 

  he could scarcely credit his senses
she actually wanted him to care she
was actually trying to break down the
wall of reserve which he had built about
his love at such sore cost to himself
poor innocent she knew no better-
she did not dream how turbulent those
emotions could be once they escaped
control he must be wise for them
both

  i didnt undertake to do that did i
he asked flippantly ive kept my part
of the bargain havent i you can get
your money whenever you want it

  there was silence behind him he 
waited a long time for her answer his
nerves braced to resist the insidious in-
fluence of her hurt tone but no word
came from her he wondered if she
had heard him rightly suddenly her
hand came before his eyes holding a
sheaf of bills

  ive had my money for a week she
said her voice void of emotion here
is what i owe you youve earned it

  he was stunned a week he
gasped then why-why didnt you
tell me

  that doesnt matter now does it
take the money-its yours

  he found himself on his feet facing
her and in that first glimpse he forgot
everything on earth except the one over-
whelming thought that above all else he
wanted this woman for his own that for
her he would exchange everything he
hoped to own or be-even his claim to
gentlemanly estate for her he would
make himself a contemptible cad a cur
a bounder for her he would damn his
soul his eyes drank her in as the
drunkard drains his glass her dusky
hair about her shoulders her slender
throat bare the beauty of her intoxicat-
ed him like some subtle stimulating drug
without conscious volition his arms
went about her crushing her to him his
lips raining eager kisses on her hair her
eyes her yielding receptive lips

  and i thought you didnt care the
alien



words were almost reverent for all the
smile upon the lips that spoke them-the
lips that seemed made for kisses he
laughed-the mad desperate laugh of
the man who has fought his battle
against himself and lost

  so you kept still about the money to
find out eh you wanted to see if i
wouldnt-care before you let me go
well youve found out youve dis-
covered that im only human after all
-that all my fine talk about being able
to behave like a gentleman was nothing
but talk and whats to be the end of
it all this cant go on we cant stay
on here pretending to be married
your husband is sure to turn up-

  he broke off to stare at her in blank
surprise she was laughing-laughing
like a roguish child  what-whats the
matter

  you warned me not to jump at con-
clusions once she said happily take
your own medicine dear i never told
you that i was married you assumed
it and i let you think so but im not-
unless this masquerade of ours has mar-

ried me to you i meant to marry that
horrible man but the moment i saw him
t knew i couldnt i ran away from him
ten minutes after i met him but id
burned my bridges i-i couldnt go
back without a husband after the letter
id left behind me and some blessed
accident of chance brought me you
he was speechless he could only
hold her fast trying to believe that this
impossible thing had actually happened
to him that he was not to lose her after
all that she was truly his against his
shoulder she whispered softly

  we can run off somewhere and be
married quietly you know i suppose it
would be better isnt it queer though
all my life ive thought it was the cere-
mony that counted she laughed a
little and now it seems as though it
really doesnt matter a bit i-i know
down in my heart that ive been mar-
ried to you for weeks

  he found his tongue at last weeks
he repeated scornfully from before
the beginning dear and until after the
end

           by adam hull shirk

 you are the daughter of another race

 dark as the mantle of a desert night

 jnly saxon blood drives blushes to my face

 when round your neck my arms gleam silver white

 yours is the passion of the hot simoons

 that gather all the heat of sun-baked sands

 beneath your close-clung kiss my spirit swoons
 and lays my heart a snared bird in your hands

 you hold me subject to your passions will-

 my lips the well to slake your fevers fire

 as at some lost oasis arabs fill

 their water-skins against the deserts ire

 so would i hold you to the luring brink

 of my calm northern love nor let you roam

 afield for then your wild desire to drink

 my cooling kiss would make my arms your home
restitution

by charles henkle

punny you should have called peter huntley a miser commented young
m phelps forcing his way into the circle about the blazing log-fire not
that he isnt he hastened to add as one or two attempted interruption
but its peculiar that you should be talking of it now 

whats the story asked hoadley the others hitched forward their chairs

and gave ear

    nothing much i met huntley downtown this evening just after dark he
had just picked up a newspaper that some man had dropped and was reading ii
under the glare of a corner light he joined me and we walked down the ave-
nue his clothes were threadbare-as usual

    at the comer of corning avenue a woman accosted us and asked for alms
she was-oh thirty-five maybe but she looked sixty a human wreck at the
very bottom rung of the ladder she had a bundle in her arms-to fool people
into thinking it was a baby and huntley-the miser the dollar-squeezer-
phelps paused for dramatic effect-handed her a crisp new five-dollar bill

    silence fell on the circle then donovan laughed derisively youve been
drinking he asserted huntley would sell his immortal soul for five dollars

    peter huntley finished the frugal meal prepared by himself for himself in
his musty ill-furnished bedroom he raised the wick of the lamp slightly be-
grudging even the tiny additional waste of oil and drew from a desk-drawer
six bank-books huntley kept his money in six banks-for safetys sake

    he smiled contentedly at the list of deposits appearing in their columns
then he frowned

    that five dollars might have gone in there too he mourned

    he lowered the light again and placed the bank-books away affectionately
tenderly then he doffed his clothes and climbed into the rickety cot in the
corner and as he lay there he remembered the girl of his youth  his love for
her their elopement their month together-and then the brutal way in which he
had deserted her without ever having gone through the formality of a marriage
ceremony

    he had almost forgotten her-until to-night the wreck to whom he had
given five dollars was the girl of long ago

    five dollars he sighed wearily then a new thought struck him
he smiled contentedly as he turned on his side at last he muttered i can
steep in peace i have made restitution


a man of affairs

       by nellie cravey gillmore

  the girls lips parted tragically a
  dull horror gathered slowly in
  her wide blue eyes her round
  boyish face framed in a mass of close-
  cropped jet curls whitened from throb-
  bing throat to blue-veined temples she
  leaned forward suddenly in her chair
  her tense hands clasped about her
  trembling knees her gaze never leaving
  the smug complacent face of the man
  who finishing his dissertation sat smil-
  ing indulgently as he puffed languid spi-
  rals of smoke toward the ceiling from
  time to time he carelessly flicked the
  ash from his stogie and glanced ap-
  praisingly at its glowing tip at last he
  resumed

    now theres not a bit of use of your
  flying off the track like this carmena
  youre no infant or ingenue youre
  not even young and inexperienced as
  the writer-folk put it youre twenty-
  seven and you have been on the stage
  eight years youve known life as it is
  in the drama if you have not lived it
  i personally you-

she halted him with a gesture of re-
i pugnance those are all flimsy argu-
 ments dudley because a woman is an
 actress is no sign that she is not still-a
woman because i have delineated the
 crucial side of life before the footlights
t does not signify that i have assimilated
j its wantonness the fact that i have
 witnessed sorrow and misery in some of
 its blackest phases is no reason why i
i should be fortified against its encroach-
ment upon my own life i admit that
i have been a fool-most women in love
 act the part one way or another i loved
i you and believed in you until i met

you my record was without spot or
blemish a man of the world and of af-
fairs you understood perfectly how to
handle me i was swept off my feet by
your dominant love-making and your
subtle phrases and you found me in my
trust and malleability an easy victim
that i did not meet you on the accepted
grounds of a vulgar liaison you who
are a past master in the art of amours
know and you also know that in no
word or deed did you indicate to me
your belief in my knowledge of the true
character of your intentions on the
contrary you spoke of our future of
children of-of all the things one would
associate with an honorable life and un-
der the spell of my love for you i gave
all-and you took all had i never
made the slip how would the affair have
terminated i wonder as it is-and if
the love you profess is genuine-does
the fact of our error exonerate either
of us from our obligations

  berrington flung his cigar into the
grate and fitted his long curving fingers
together tip by tip a show of sang-
froid was essential to render his words
effective he shrugged

  obligations he laughed as though
in relish of a huge joke my dear
young lady as regards the relations of
men and women that word has long
since skidded from our vocabulary
your sex has demonstrated its ability
through its desire to stand side by side
shoulder to shoulder with ours the
responsibility is mutual il were to be
good sports we must take a chance to
prove our ginger we must be game
losers-eh 




a man of affairs

  despite the rein she had upon herself
carmenas lips trembled

  then it was only a gamble-with
marked cards she said slowly a harsh
note creeping into her voice you
never really-cared

  cared ofcourse i did-and i do
im quite fond of you you little irish
rose but im not a marrying man
believe me the yoke of matrimony is
iron and wormwood combined the mar-
riage-couch is the death-bed of romance
why spoil our happiness by continued
references to the prosaic the impos-
sible

  the girl fell back in her chair her
hands outspread upon the great flat
arms the flickering glare of the pink and
yellow fire falling mockingly upon her
still set features there were no tears
no sighs only a dead coldness realiza-
tion freezing to despair

  berrington stretched himself smiled
reached over and laid a soft sinuous
hand on her knee come come little
girl away with dull care the baby
delft up there says half-past seven ive
tickets in my pocket for the blue bird
and the show begins at eight-thirty get
into your things and-

  but carmena flung off his touch with
a gesture of loathing and sat upright
stiffening of a sudden from the diminu-
tive tips of her bronze slippers to the
crown of her shining curls her words
came with a brittle snap absolutely de-
void of their old mellowness their erst-
while tenderness and appeal

  it is all over all over do you under-
stand i cant go on this way i wont
i see my mistake in all its naked hideous-
ness  he time to recoup lias come
im going to begin right now im going
to blot this week out of my life forever
-erase every memory-and start again
with a clean slate if as you say it is
all a game then i shall play straight
from now on its the only way to win
n the long run you cant get away
with cheating always

  berringtons brows went up and some
of the florid color faded from his face
me gazed at her curiously with a touch
of apprehension the affair was but
seven days old and satiety had not yet
begun its process of conversion lie
was fond of the girl and the prospect
of losing her so soon affected him dis-
agreeably he rose and went to the
back of her chair letting his hands slip
down till they encircled her velvet chin

  carmena he pleaded dont you
love me how can you be so merciless
does the past count for nothing are
you going to leave me like this

  a wild little laugh broke from her
lips she jerked herself out of his
reach rose and faced him her eyes
were luminous with suppressed fire
crimson blazed in her cheeks

  if my love means so much to you
she said passionately there is a way
for you to keep it the past as you put
it has its place without a doubt but
the future has a bigger one it is in
the future we must live but for my
own part i intend that that living shall
be right i shall willingly gladly for-
get every horrible thing you have sai l
if as a man of honor you wish to help
me retrieve-

  poppycock carmena if id list-
ened to all such twaddle thats been
dished out to me id have brigham
young skinned alive i told you i was
not a marrying man i tried that once
and i got an overdose prunella obli-
gingly divorced me convinced herself of
the truth of my arguments that matri-
mony was the crucifixion of sentiment
afterwards she died leaving a fair
young daughter whom i have wisely
kept penned up in a convent in switzer-
land these past ten years if i were a
man of honor the type you designate
i should have proceeded immediately to
make carlotta and helen and mazie and
the whole endless string of them my
wives in turn some of them were sen-
sible-like myself-and we parted amic-
nellie cravey gillmore



ably others not so sensible are i pre-
sume still engaged in devising schemes
for my destruction as promised or have
discreetly gone on to other-things
while i love  love deeply and exclu-
sively but it were far better to part
from dear ones with sweet recollections
than to hang on only to witness the in-
evitable corrosion of our ideals and feel
the disintegration of cherished illusions
therefore loveliest of women let us
separate while the charm of our affec-
tion is fresh and beautiful the desola-
tion will be hard to bear but it could
not be so cruel as the disillusion which
would certainly follow if we acted other-
wise

 carmena stood by the mantel the
pink flesh of her bare arm pressed
against the sharp edge a contemptuous
little smile twisted her lips scarlet as
peonies

  if you are finished she observed
coolly i must ask you for about two
minutes in which to settle a little busi-
ness proposition may i proceed

  berrington bowed and dropped easily
into his chair

  carmena crossed the floor a silken
swish of rose-colored draperies making
music about her and paused before a
small rosewood escritoire she turned
the key and took from a compartment a
neatly-bound packet this she placed
in berringtons hands

  you will find there an amount suf-
ficient to cover my expenses for the
past week most of the jewels you have
given me are in the bank i will get
them to-morrow and together with
what i have here forward them to you
at once now you may go

  berrington opened his lips by way of
protest but his furtive eyes caught the
glitter in hers and he compromised on
a rather stupid little nod he got up
and straightened his tie before the man-
tel mirror carmena went into the ante-
room and returned with his fur coat
and green alpine he took them from

her in silence with an awkwardness
that was new to him he stole surrep-
titious glances toward her but they told
him nothing she seemed as passive
as immobile as stone only her eyes
hinted emotion and that was indefinable

  he drew on his coat and buttoned it
up hat in hand he walked toward the
door on the threshold he turned

  good-by he said

  good-by she answered

  the months that followed were none
too savory ones for dudley berrington
man of affairs business took a dis-
couraging slump some of his invest-
ments proved worthless he suffered
an acute attack of inflammatory rheum-
atism and the long hours of confinement
told upon his nerves his dissipations
had weakened his powers of resistance
and he brooded

  furthermore he missed carmena
the little actress had made more of a
dent in his life than wras usually the
case with his affaires de cirur he ad-
mitted the fact reluctantly though he
explained it on the ground that their
relations had ended almost as soon as
they had begun he had enjoyed only
a taste of this last amour avhereas as a
rule he was accustomed to glut himself
upon the fruit of his desires before toss-
ing away the empty rind he had
neither seen nor heard of her since the
night of their parting and he won-
dered-many things

  to add to the stress a letter came
from switzerland informing him of his
daughters graduation in june follow-
ing which according to previous ar-
rangement she would leave for america
a nunnish girl of eighteen what in
the world would he do with her  she
would of course have to come to her
fathers home to live-there was no al-
ternative but such a contingency filled
berrington with forebodings it meant
that there would have to be a complete
change in his mode of living a giving-


a man of affairs

up of his fast friends and the renuncia-
tion of most of the pleasures with which
he had filled his life

  as the weeks went on he experienced
greater and greater depression and ap-
prehension when the day of her ar-
rival rolled around it was only by a
tremendous effort of the will grown
flabby from lack of exercise that he
screwed himself up to face the ordeal
there was one thing at least to be
thankful for - for the first time in twenty
years he was free from feminine en-
tanglement since carmena had gone
so abruptly out of his life no other
woman had entered it that however
was merely accidental or the result of
absorbing conditions his solitary
estate was bound to be only temporary
life devoid of the stimulus of a fair com-
panion would be as flat as a long-opened
bottle of champagne yet how could he
manage with isabel in the house to ques-
tion his goings and comings perhaps to
make unlimited demands upon his time
and attention and to be unconsciously
the censor of his very morals

  one glance at her unsophisticated face
spelt the obliteration of all his dreams
rang the death-knell of his last hope
she flung her arms about his neck as she
stepped from the gang-plank and kissed
him in the effusive way she had imbibed
from her french associates

  why-why youre so young father
dear she exclaimed his unexpected
youthfulness obsessed her and she re-
curred to the topic after they had reached
the house and were seated before the
drawing-room fire to await dinner
why  always thought of you as an old
old man she said her round eyes trav-
eling over him in innocent wonderment

  i had no idea and such a good-look-
ing daddy too so fine and straight with
little tufts of white at the temples so
like the charming padre

berrington flushed under her praise
her frank admiration pleased him al-
though her naivete sent a frightened

chill down his spine if she were less
candid not so ingenuous how much
easier it would be to handle her

  im no end delighted youre so
pleased my dear i-i was uneasy lest
youd be disappointed here ait off from
your companions and shut up in this
great old house with only the servants
my time is-er-very much taken up
with my affairs and i fear youll be
lonely-

  never that in all these lovely sur-
roundings she cut in enthusiastically
a bewitching little foreign accent in her
speech  shall find plenty to be busy
at and my fathers friends-they must
be mine-yes she perched on his
knee and smiled merrily with her bright
gray eyes into his sober gray ones

  certainly certainly we shall find you
plenty of friends my child it wouldnt
do at all for you to be dull and some-
times well attend the theatre the
opera-

  isabel clapped her hands in glee
glorious she cried im just crazy
for the opera ive been only twice in
my life but now- her eyes gave
an ecstatic upward roll as panoramic
visions of what was to come flashed
luridly before her mental vision and she
fell to singing a gay little parisian air
fiddling the while with the buttons on
her fathers coat or playing with the
curls that clustered about his ears
every little while she interrupted her-
self to chirp delightedly over some fresh
discovery her eager eyes fastened upon
the beautiful tinted and frescoed walls
so unlike the drab ones of the convent
the wonderful old paintings that gar-
nished them the kings ransom in rugs
that covered the polished floors the ex-
quisite bric-a-brac

  berrington began to breathe more eas-
ily she was an enthusiast it would be
a simple matter to provide her with in-
terests that would engross her attention
and thus allow him his accustomed free-
dom
nellie cravey gillmore



  dinner was presently announced and
they got through their meal without a
hitch isabel rhapsodized over the cui-
sine praised the rare china and had her
first taste of wine the last brought a
sparkle to her eyes and carnations to her
cheeks berrington reflected what an
exceedingly pretty girl she was he was
conscious of a stir of fatherly pride

  there was nothing of her mother
about the girl except perhaps her petite
figure her features and her coloring
and her vivacity were all berrington
she was witty and demure by turns
prunella had been neither-just practical
and sober isabels father heaved a sigh
of relief how accommodating his wife
had been to remove herself from their
lives a woman like her would have
cramped the childs development stunted
her mental growth destroyed her youth-
ful exuberance curiously enough be-
fore the end of the first day and in di-
rect contradiction of his former feelings
berrington found himself taking a deep
interest in his stranger-daughter and for-
mulating plans for her future

  as the days came and went his inter-
est increased her companionship while
it lacked the verve and sparkle of the
other kind was distinctly refreshing
she came out wonderfully under his
painstaking tutelage he was most care-
ful in the selection of the guests he in-
vited to their home and he saw to it
that she lacked for nothing in the way of
entertainment of the right kind spend-
ing-money and a wardrobe of costliness
and elegance they became close
friends

  but there were times when the con-
ventionality palled upon berrington the
diet of decent living was wholesome
enough he mused inwardly but what
he wanted was an occasional dash of
tabasco to fire his jaded pujses he
sighed for the white lights and the gay
cabaret he pined for the clinging arms
of fair women their sentient glances
their provocative lips iiis longing took

the form of obsession and he began to
absent himself oftener and for longer in-
tervals from home he framed ready
lies which were unquestioningly be-
lieved by his gullible daughter

  and isabel left much to herself did
not want for excitement she had a
penchant for making friends and she
possessed a spirit of adventure and the
berrington temperament she began to
meet persons outside the list of those
prescribed by her father she went on
madcap expeditions and enjoyed thrill-
ing escapades and she kept her mouth
shut finally she fell in love know-
ing that her father would never consent
to her marrying an actor she made her
plans to elope

  and so one night returning late from
a supper at one of the wilder semi-
bohemian restaurants berrington was
greeted by the maid with the tidings of
his daughters disappearance she had
left no note no explanation she was
just-gone her room was in disorder
the bed untouched there could be no
thought of foul play there was every
indication of prearranged departure

  berrington collapsed

  detectives were set to work on the
case and advertisements inserted in all
the papers

  the mornings post brought a letter
propped up in bed his face haggard and
colorless berrington broke the seal with
shaking fingers the handwriting was
familiar but for a moment he could not
place it although as he read on realiza-
tion forced its way gradually to his dull
brain

wednesday evening

  thinking that perhaps you would be inter-
ested to learn the whereabouts of your daugh-
ter i am dropping you these few lines to let
you know she eloped a few hours ago with
my brother they took passage on the
tonic for liverpool  brought them tocuier
i met your daughter one afternoon m the
green-room after a matinee she fell tor
llertie at once and recalling what you nave
said about love and happiness and all those
things i did all i could to help along their
romance


a man of affairs

   no doubt you will be pleased to learn that
there was no marriage ceremony-this accord-
ing to your code of ethics like yourself
bertie is not a marrying man and isabel
like yourself is sport enough to take a chance
will you join me in wishing them good luck

carmena

   the paper fluttered from berringtons
nerveless hands to the floor he buried
his face in the bed-covering and cried
like a baby

   a week passed berrington the skel-
eton of his former self had been helped
out of bed to a chair by the window
he sat there gazing mechanically out
at the sun-baked pavements and the
flowers on the lawn drooping and wilt-
ing in the sultry midsummer sun his
breathing was labored and his hands
rested limp and cold on his knees his
sunken eyes were tense with the only
real agony he had ever known

  suddenly there came a tentative rap
on his apartment door he called a
weak come in and the footman en-
tered with a card

  berrington accepted it absently and
glanced at the name

miss carmena aylward

  let her come up he said eagerly
a faint dash of red showed beneath the
pallor of his cheeks his eyes brightened
perhaps she had news for him any-
thing were better than this anguish of
waiting and hoping he did hope
though after all what was there to hope
for

  he held out a trembling hand as she
came into the room but carmena either
did not or would not sec it she pulled
up a chair and sat facing him an exult-
ant light gleaming in her blue eyes she
smiled grimly

  so you have suffered she re-
marked

   you dont need my word for it car-
   mena you have only to look at me

   a gleam of cruelty not unmixed with

pity crossed the womans face she
sank back in her chair and began to draw
off her gloves her eyes going past him
now to the glimpse of sky that showed
through the open window her lips re-
laxed into a smile still she did not
speak

  berrington stared at her miserably
why did you come here what have
you to tell me he demanded at last

  i came to ascertain for myself just
what the result has been and to tell you
the truth she replied answering both
of his questions in an absolutely calm
voice

  the transitory color fled from his
face then for gods sake dont de-
lay dont you see im in hell has
anything-happened 

  carmena made a little disdainful ges-
ture and her lips tightened she looked
at him intently for a moment then be-
gan quietly to speak

  i shall begin at the beginning nat-
urally i had some curiosity to meet your
daughter your daughter she reiterated
significantly i wanted to see what sort
of creature it was who owed her being
to a-a person like you she was point-
ed out to me on the street one day
afterwards i saw her in a box at the
theatre where i was playing she came
there regularly for weeks to see me you
see i was quick to sense the impres-
sion id made later when she visited
the green-room i was glad to make her
acquaintance our-friendship-ripened
quickly

  it was not long before i discovered
she was the sentimental sort full of tem-
perament and as reckless as-well let
us say as yourself i saw where she
was headed and so i hit upon a scheme
i began to make mad love to her she
thought i txcis a man-i had been play-
ing the part of an irish sailor-boy the
others helped along the joke the af-
fair progressed furiously i left no art
no wil unemployed to win her body
and soul she responded with all your
nellie cravey gillmore



own subtleties dudley-a natural inher-
itance i suppose but all the while i
could tell she was as innocent as a lamb
if it hadnt been i it would have been
some other man-a real one she was
ripe for the occasion and she would
have gone straight to perdition at a
lovers bidding

  oh i played my cards well i assure
you with all the art and finesse of the
skilled gambler i had been taught the
rules of the game and i knew the win-
ning hands i wove every fascination i
could devise about her till i had her in
my toils i told her finally that there
was an insurmountable barrier to our
marriage but asked her if she cared
enough to give herself to me without
the tie she said she did and the
elopement was planned

  i had made arrangements to have a
wireless sent to me aboard the ship just
after it had left the harbor recalling
me on important business i explained
to isabel that i was compelled to leave
her but that i would follow on the next
steamer i assured her that her return
to new york with me would spell disas-
ter to all our hopes i caught the pilot-
boat back and-

  berrington was quivering like an as-
pen his face was still pale to grayness
but the tense lines had left it giving
place to an expression of unutterable re-
lief when he spoke his voice was
hoarse and tremulous

  thank god  he said and you did
all this-why carmena because you
loved me-or because you hated me

  neither i did it to save her from
my own tragic fate-and to teach you
a lesson i wished you to suffer all the
pangs of retribution for your sins with-
out the innocent being injured to accom-
plish it i believe i have succeeded and
that in so doing i have also saved many
another innocent woman from your
clutches i have just one thing to thank
you for dudley and that is-for show-
ing me the truth before it was too late

for giving me the chance to snatch back
my slipping womanhood before the gut-
ter had sucked it down past recovery
a slow flush mounted to berringtons
cheek-bones his eyes glowed with a sud-
den flash like the light of other days

  carmena caught herself together and
met his gaze impassively

  he jerked his chair forward and at-
tempted to get possession of her hands
but she deliberately put them behind her
and resumed speaking where she had
left off a moment before

  you will of course take whatever
steps you see fit toward bringing your
daughter home but i demand one
thing and your own common-sense will
make you agree to it she must never
know of the deception let her believe
she was tricked by her lover it will
sober her and cure her of her folly do
you understand-and promise

  berrington nodded yes he said
gravely it shall be as you say i will
do anything you ask carmena you are
quite wonderful to me i always felt
that there was something superior about
you i have bitterly regretted our part-
ing for-i have always loved you will
you not forgive the past and be my
wife  again he tried to take her hands
and again she moved them out of his
reach

  she rose and stood looking down at
him for a long minute then she shook
her head slowly all that is over dud-
ley those fires consumed me quite-
long ago there are only ashes here
now her hand touched above her
heart for a fleeting second then fell list-
lessly to her side she smiled a trifle
wistfully

  good-by she said

  berrington a sudden accession of new
strength firing him leaped from his chair
and followed her to the door

  carmena for gods sake- but
the words were cut short by the shutting-
to of the door and in that instant ber-
rington knew that he was beaten


the love-roost

  outside the woman buried her con-
vulsed face in her hands a quiver
racked her slender body after all she
had cared-very deeply but it was too
late she flung up her head and con-

jured a brave smile to the face set un-
flinchingly toward the future

she had pledged herself to a iifework

of uplift for the grief-stricken and the
fallen and she meant to stick

          where the city swains and misses

smithia mirabilis

        by richard irving carson

 fces mister they all do said
  doctor leal and smith looked
 down into the plaza from
 the governor down added the doctor
 smiling

   smith gazed for some minutes with
 the eager interest that afflicts strangers
 in portuguese west coast towns the
 saturnine men in spotless white suits the
 muscular native porters the brightly
 clad women ranging in color from-well
 not quite white to ebony-it was so new

   all of smiths training and his moth-
 ers puritan blood surged for an instant
 to the front

   no said he shortly

   well-but wont you see her any-

way

   the other hesitated then thoughts
 of the girl in england who had jilted
 him at her mothers word-and perhaps
 of other things-flew across his mind
 and he was young and he had been ill
 and he didnt drink and it was-africa
 and besides he was determined to be
 reckless and to play the part expected
 of him

   all right he acquiesced with a sort
 of shamefaced and hard little laugh

   the doctor threw open the door be-
 hind him and motioned smith to enter

   what-is she here the surprised
 man gasped

   why yes returned the other a
 mischievous smile on his face

   there was no hope for it now and
 smith entered the room

   the afternoon was as hot and luxu-
  rious as it can be only in west africa
 nd joaquina tired of the long wait had
 improved the time by indulging in a

siesta as the door opened letting a
flood of light into the room she half
rose from the bed her embroidered
panno or shoulder robe falling from
her with wide eyes heavy with sleep
she gazed at the tall man before her for
a moment unconscious of her bare
breasts and wondrous arms then with
a tiny laugh and a shrug of shoulders
as perfect as clyties she gathered her
cloth under her armpits and stayed it
above her bosom with the deft half-knot
that she had learned in childhood from
her mother she then stood up and
looked at him proudly her face and neck
dully flushed as if conscious of what
was the fact that through her father
the blood of duchesses flowed in her
veins

  the doctor was standing behind
smith

  as i was saying- he resumed in
his slow voice

  she shall go with me interrupted
smith thickly he was not playing a
part now

  the other smiled again

  esta ban he murmured to himself
with a little sigh-whether of satisfac-
tion or regret it is impossible to say
perhaps memories of the hundreds of
young men arriving on the coast how
many of them now lying in the white
cemetery north of the town to whom
during twenty years he had given simi-
lar advice crossed his mind perhaps
he did not even believe in the advice
but-well one must live and doctors
who gave different advice rarely stayed
their year out so he merely looked at
smith with the air of one who has just




smithia mirabilis

delivered himself of a valuable bit of
disinterested counsel

 the other man seemed to hesitate
again his blood and traditions still
questioned but with another glance at
joaquina who no darker than a south-
ern spaniard was still standing by the
bed with the sleep not yet out of her
eyes his cheeks grew hot and he said
nervously

  all right doctor you arrange it
i have seen her when can i start 

  oh you might be off any time now
the fever will not return answered the
other rising to go adeus mister
boa viagcm 

  good-by answered smith shaking
the proffered hand

  the next day he was lying in a tepoia
listening to the patter of his carriers
feet on the path as they swung along
he was en route for the interior and
in his caravan went joaquina

  stanisland smith was the naturalist
of the portuguese government in the
west african province of angola an
account of how he chanced to be occupy-
ing this position would be too long to
include here but such names as wel-
witsch burnay blandy lepierre and
newton in that part of the world occur
oftener in connection with achievements
implying energy and ability than do the
ancient portuguese patronyms of silva
oliveira santos sousa and what not
suffice it to say that although a foreign-
er smith was ambitious-first in love
which to him meant the wooing of the
honorable miss clare the second
daughter of the late-well it is not
necessary to enter into details here
either farther than to state that the
name is one of the oldest in the united
kingdom and that miss clares mother
the dowager was horribly scandalized
when she learned that a democratic
american dared to lift his eyes even to
her second daughter

god bless us exclaimed her lady-
ship i suppose it is all part of the

heathen age we live in-any person
thinks he is as good as a duke nowadays
society is undone thank heaven i shall
not live long to see such anarchy i
forbid you to see him again clare i
must give orders for his name to be left
off the lists of both the hall and the
castle how could welsmouth have
been so careless as to introduce him

  so the two ladies wrote letters miss
clare dutifully conveying her mothers
wishes to smith and the dowager her
own to lord welsmouth who smiled a
wry smile and wrote for smith to call
on him during which call he as presi-
dent of the society which is the arbiter
and rewarder of scientific endeavor
among anglo-saxons proposed an ar-
rangement eagerly accepted by smith
that led to the events recorded in the
beginning of this narrative

  once in ngolo the point farthest in
the interior of the colony smith worked
more like a fiend than a man and at
the end of his first year he had com-
munications from the secretary of the
society reprints clippings a worthless
decoration from the portuguese gov-
ernment and a personal letter from
lord welsmouth that made him almost
happv for the moment he and joa-
quina also had-little florinda

  little florinda with blue eyes and
smiths mothers own bonny flaxen hair
his commission expired at the end of
two years but the government was glad
to renew it and little florinda grew
and played about the pleasant bungalow
near the fort where smith lived and
made his collections and wrote his re-
ports

  one day she came running to him
with a flower in her hand

  see tan-tan her queer african
reduplication of his lipped name stan
which she always applied to him she
demanded he looked into her merry
eyes and drawing her to his knee
kissed her look at my flower she
insisted i calls it my toad flower
richard irving carson



  the man looked languidly at the plant
the little girl held toward him even
a year ago he would have been all keen-
ness and interest over such a discovery
for his wide exact knowledge of the
group to which it evidently belonged as-
sured him that it represented a new
genus and family and probably demand-
ed a revision of the accepted doctrines
regarding the relationships of its natural
order yet even while his practised eye
toid him so much he turned listlessly
from the specimen as joaquina entered
and resumed by the window her usual
task of lace-making she made lace
every day and sold it-against the time
when smith should go home or she
grow old it is the usual custom in
west africa from time to time as her
work permitted she turned her deep
eyes to smiths face and smiled the slow
smile of a satisfied southern woman

  it was the old story ambition was
dead only when he turned to look at
little florinda still standing by his knee
did his face light and even that had an
afterlook of pain

  oh oh shouted the child with de-
light a soldier man is coming from the
fort maybe the senhor major is send-
ing me another doll

  not knowing why smith sprang up
and seized the mail package from the
man he tore open an envelope the
words blurred before his eyes and he sat
gazing at the sheet of paper in his hand
dully seeking to understand the words
that seemed to evade him poor mama
is dead    lord welsmouth whom
you know is my guardian    he lias
consented to my writing you    oh
stan forgive me i am so lonely  
these and other sentences were trying
to reach his heart now almost as dead
as the paper upon which they were writ-
ten

  the other letters were mostly from
various sazctnts in paris berlin and
london one was from his mother
he locked this last in his desk unread

  tan-tan whispered little florinda
almost crying will there never be any-
thing for me

  smith looked at her sadly no he
said at length

  the child threw her arms about him
and sobbed and at last the man wept
also joaquina looked from her lace at
them with a gently perplexed gaze

  finally little florinda went out and
after a time returned with many more
of the strange flowers

  i brought them so you would not
cry any more tan-tan she said as
she laid them on his table

  weeks went by as smith worked on
the new specimens it was the best
work of his life because he dared think
of nothing else when the work was
sent off and the time drew near to hear
from the society concerning it he fell
into the habit of walking down to the
fort even- morning to see if the mail
had arrived he had never bothered
about its irregular arrival before one
morning he was surprised to find the
major talking bad french to a well set-
up american

  boules-bous du cafe monsiorf lie
was asking as smith came up to the
veranda

   vous- began the other and then
jumped up almost upsetting the little
table

  why stan smith you rascal  he
yelled delightedly

  smith looked at him steadily then
he said in an emotionless voice

  winslow

 right you are again hamlet
laughed the other boisterously ou
seem to have forgotten how to smile
old man

  yes answered smith

  climate my dear boy climate
grinned the newcomer sitting down
again however iii chirk you up in
no time ive just come up from the
coast you know im head of this sur-
vey party for the new railroad


smithia mirabilis

  smith sipped his coffee and said noth-
ing winslow rattled on

  never dreamed of seeing you
though do you know weve never met
since we left college say but im glad
to sec you knew you were somewhere
in west africa-but this is unexpected
luck by the way i met some friends
of yours in london recently ihe hon-
orable miss-

  yes smith leaned across the table

  the other did not notice  shes just
married he went on

  who clare demanded smith
with darkened eyes

  why yes i believe thats her name
didnt you- began winslow and then
glancing at smith stopped suddenly

  why old man whats the matter r
he rsked

  sruith rose and strode towards his
liouse

  it was all for her he said over and
over to himself

  the major and his companion finished
their coffee in uneasy silence a shot
echoed from the hillside both men
rose to their feet

  ok est-v began the american but
paused

  little florinda ran screaming into the
enclosure

  tan-tan she gasped come

  winslow took the childs hand and
led her sobbing up the road

  he found joaquina weeping by the
bed and little florinda wildly joined
her cries the big strong man led them
very gently from the room at the door
he met a black soldier who saluted and
handed him a package of letters he
reentered the room and did the work
that was his to do then he glanced
about the room on the table was a
note it was addressed to him

   the money in the dispatch-box is for toa-
om irdl- send my scientific papers to
 wcumouth--others to my mother read
lhc	letters and ak the

  major to forward to lord w those coming

  winslow opened the packet and con-
scientiously began to read the letters
most of them again were from scien-
tific authorities on the subjects that the
dead man had studied so well finally
he came to the following

my dear smith

  your specimens and reports are at hand
and have been presented to the society i
may tell you at once that yours is the most
important discovery of the year you have
been made a fellow and your paper appears
in extenso in the transactions with one change
which  took the liberty of making the ge-
neric name ivelsmoutkia which you so kindly
proposed in my honor has been recently used
by latour of paris for a species of mollusc
so i have proposed the term smithia mirabilis
in place of your ivelsinouthia mirabilis

  the scientific papers are full of your epoch-
making observation arid you have been elected
professor by the board of regents of the new
university i have accepted for you contingent
upon your approval

  clare whose mother died recently and whose
sister is now married is now my ward and
we shall be glad to welcome you at my town
house as soon as you can get here

  hoping to sec you in the course of a few
weeks i am

                sincerely your friend

welsroouth

  poor smith he said to himself
choking and it was i who told him
that miss clare was married

  then he opened the last letter and
read slowly as his eyes were dimmed

dear stan

  lord welsmouth has just told me of your
discovery and that it assures your career he
says you may e in london by the last of next
month oh stan  am so proud of you i
wont you come to me

clare

  winslow thought a long time

  this will take some lying he said

finally

  joaquina and little florinda were in
the loanda cemetery by smiths grave

  it had cost joaquina all the proceeds
of her lace-making and the contents of
the dispatch-box to have him brought
from ngolo to the coast and buried near
her home doctor leal was guiding a
party of english people to the same
envy



place among them was a handsome old
gentleman whom the doctor addressed
as senhor visconde anti a beautiful
lady now with tears on her face whom
the old gentleman called clare the
ladies drew their skirts away from joa-
quina and her child one of them who
had fair hair streaked with silver
glanced pityingly at little florinda and
said emphatically to the doctor who
was very pale

  i am sure that my sons life out here
was an example to all

  lord welsmouth nodded approval
who are they whispered the child
to her mother

  they are the ba-iuglesi says joa-
quina all his countrymen come to see
his grave he was a very wise man
little florinda was delighted with the

 new stone that the great learned society
 had sent out and had set up over his
 grave she recognized the bas-relief of
 her toad flower over the two initials
 she asked her mother what the words
 underneath it were

 joaquina stared at the letters

florye guinensi s invest igatorum
princeps

 but they meant nothing to her

hush she said in her native kim-
bundu tongue i cannot read

does it say tan-tan persisted the
child

 i think so

 it is tan-tan said little florinda
 softly content that she had solved the
 problem

thoroughly feminine

              by octavus roy cohen

mrs chester carroll was
filled surfeited satiated with
fiction as she laid aside the
flaringly-covered copy of the latest best
seller she reclined luxuriously on her
softly cushioned chaise longue and
heaved a deep sigh

  mrs chester carroll allowed her mind
to review the plot of the story she had
just read-it was the same pill as of old
with a sugar coating of a new taste in
chapter one the heroine was depicted as
being on the brink of ruin-moral ruin
in chapter two she slipped one foot over
the edge from the commencement of
chapter three until the end of chapter
thirty-two she hung there teetering in
chapter thirty-three she decided that vir-
tue wasnt worth the fight and prepared
to fling herself into the ever-ready vil-
lains arms in chapter thirty-four she
does it-but the hero comes along at the
psychological moment with the belated
offer of marriage and they leave for
palm beach in his new yacht

  she had known it would be ke that
even before she opei d the boo- ome-
how the timeworn plot never grew dull
for her she loved to fight the heroines
fight with her to share the strenuous de-
lights of the battle against the husky vil-
lains wiles to-i blush to admit it-to
turn page after page in the hope that
some one of the heroines would yield-
and the hero fail to play his part of
virtue-saver

  that was corinne carrolls chiefest
disappointment the virtue of the best
seller heroines was too iron-clad it
heated to the fusing-point and then re-
fused to fuse eventually it became a

mania with her this search for a heroine
of qualities more human than they of
cloth covers

  and gradually the desires of her search
had transmuted themselves into the very
fibre of her being without strict anal-
ysis of her own emotions she deter-
mined that as authors would not make
their heroines act as she wished them to
she would prove that it might be done

  horrors the conclusion is readily
drawn mrs corinne carroll was an
unmoral woman terrifying but let
it go at that for it is the truth the
strict truth and nothing but the truth

  it is almost a waste of words to ex-
plain that mrs corinne carroll was the
legal spouse of a very rich man who sat
daily on the stock exchange and was
in the way of affording many luxuries
which he did not have-and the many
which he did have and also that ches-
ter carroll neglected his wife shame-
fully in his mad rush after dollars to
add to his already countless horde and
also that there was a tertium quidi

  it was this third person the second
man the family friend that put the
idea in corinnes head in all her pet
novels it was the family friend who
essayed the wrecking of the home and
always the procedure was the same the
husband money - mad succeeded in
throwing wife and friend together until
propinquity got in its villainous work-
only to be thwarted by a latent awaken-
ing of the husbands love for frail wifie
the friend always fell in love with the
wife despite his better nature the wife
with the friend because liers was a tem-
peramental nature which craved love
octavus roy cohen



  but in vaguely determining to carry
the thing through to a highly-colored
conclusion-with nary a thought to the
drab dusk to follow-corinne faced
facts as facts and the facts she faced
are those which are either handled in
the epilogue of a novel or else are not
handled at all and these were the
facts

  first joe manning the all-important
family friend was not in love with her
furthermore he was a true friend to
chester carroll and harbored no home-
w recking ambitions

  second joe manning acted suspi-
ciously as though he thought pretty well
of another and less attached female
against whom it was rumored he had
directed love-thoughts leading eventually
to the altar

  third mrs corinne carroll knew
that one solution of the difficulty would
be denied her in the event that her trans-
gression should be discovered by the
irate husband-the husband is always
irate-and that is that he should never
come in at the wrong-right time and find
her embroidering pink and blue gar-
ments of lilliputian proportions

  but she also fairly marshaled her
facts on the other side of the picture
they loomed up about this way

  first joe manning was one hundred
per cent man which means that he was
fifty per cent angel and fifty per cent
devil he was big strong handsome
and intensely virile

  second she was thoroughly feminine
of no little beauty and with a figure
that artist friends of the family had dis-
creetly raved over and which brought
glitters to the eyes of many of them
also by reason of the tabloid instruc-
tions absorbed from her fiction diet she
was thoroughly adept in the weak points
of masculine man

  third although the husbands in fic-
tion always suspected her husband never
would he wasnt that kind and hed
never believe that she was

  fourth she was inexpressibly bored
and sick and tired of convention

  fifth even if she succeeded in her
little plan she would be safe she not
being of a hysterical nature herself and
joe manning being a gentleman and
notoriously close-mouthed

  and so with thoughts of the future
as vague as the suggestion of a cloud
on an early-morning horizon she-to use
the vernacular-went to it

  and once in it she kept at it she
dined alone with joe manning and
sought him on every possible occasion
she practised with all the art at her
command the various and sundry little
tricks which her favorite authors always
made use of she studied those things
which interested him and spoke learn-
edly of them thereby showing a flatter-
ing interest in him and his work she
touched him whenever possible thereby
helping along the good work which
pater propinquity always does

  she let it be known by look word and
action that she was infatuated with him
and in due course of time she saw that
she was winning her battle for there
was an unmistakable gleam in his eyes
as he watched her when they were alone
a heaving of the chest and a nervous
clasping of his big strong hands which
were readable as the printed page of one
of her pet books and just about that
time the last vague suggestion of fear
which had lodged persistently in mrs
chester carrolls mind was routed
propinquity had cut with a double-edged
sword in brief she was glad that she
had done what she had and insanity had
usurped cold reason

  her psychical capitulation was prin-
cipally due to the fact that joe man-
nings surrender had not come without
a struggle with amazing lack of ego
he had for a long time refused to credit
the evidence of his senses-the evidence
which told him that his friends wife
loved him but once he surrendered he
did so unconditionally


thoroughly feminine

  joe manning was no fool and he
knew corinne he knew her well enough
to read the signs and he realized that
her love for him was the passion of an
adult awakened woman he knew
what it meant and by that time he had
reached the point where he didnt care

  and the climax came one niht when
they had been to the theatre together
chester carroll was in chicago co-
rinne her bosom rising and falling with
a knowledge that the time had arrived
invited joe manning to her private sit-
ting-room at midnight she flung her
evening wrap across a lounge thereby
disclosing a wealth of perfect ivory-
tinted flesh her attitude was one of
surrender of eagerness for capture her
every gesture inviting alluring tanta-
lizing

  and joe manning forgot that this was
the wife of his best friend he forgot the
ethics of manhood he forgot everything
save that she had aroused his most pow-
erful feelings and that she was his for
the asking his voice was choked and
hoarse as he spoke after staring at her
for full a minute in speechless wonder

  corinne he gasped you-are-
exquisite f

  her being thrilled at the words at the
timbre of his voice

  you think so

  think so good god you arc
the most- his big fists clenched and
the perspiration stood out in little beads
on his forehead

  she advanced slowly toward him and
paused close to him her perfect bosom

rising and falling tumultuously the
very passion of her permeated the room

chester carroll was forgotten

  corinne joes cry was hoarse
desperate reckless

  imperceptibly she swayed toward him
his huge arms dosed convulsively about
her he pulled her to him with a her-
culean display of brute strength his
hot face bent to hers and forced it back
he rained burning kisses on her parted
lips

  for a second she lay passive then
she writhed and tore loose with a sud-
den accession of unnatural strength

  she stood erect and quivering then
her hand flashed out against his cheek
stingingly

  you-you-beast f she sibilated
you beast

  he stared at her suddenly deathly
cold his jaw sagged

  go she panted and never let me
see your face again go

  slowly wonderingly he made his way
out of her private sitting-room his
world had become chaos life had be-
come stark-appallingly stark

  the front door slammed as he left
in her room corinne carroll-mrs
chester carroll-furiously brushed her
lips where his had so feverishly pressed
then she collapsed into a little sobbing
heap on the floor

  how dared he she moaned with
the heart-wrung fervor of outraged vir-
tue how dared he the beast

which proves probably that fiction is
neither more nor less strange than truth 

jealousy is the needed dash of bitters in the cocktail of love

a return to eden

an idyll in one act
by hilliard booth

scene a sloping hill by the side of a swimming-pool
a grassy bank runs down to the water and willows
and oaks form a protecting background on the right
of the bank sprawls upon his back an athlete his dark skin
glistening with the water from which he has just emerged
as he stretches his untrammeled body gratefully in the warm
sunshine on the left in a similar attitude lies his friend a
slightly younger man lithe and gracef ul-a figure of arca-
dia rather than eden in the centre between the two re-
clines a country youth stripped as the others for the pool
and gazing into it as he lies upon his stomach his elbows on
the ground his chin on his hands his sturdy strength
suggests brute force rather than conscious power as the
curtain is raised he speaks

           the yokel
  i told you it was a great pool didnt i 

           the athlete
  i havent enjoyed a swim so much
  since i was a boy that was a great
  suggestion of yours ed to come into the
  country for the afternoon

            the poet
  dont call me ed i have put aside
  my identity with my clothes

           the athlete
  narcissus then

            the poet
  that is better you might be her-
  cules

the athlete laughing

  and our friend here

            the poet
the satyr who has led us to the pool
r but no we are ourselves and have re-
turned into the garden that is best

           the athlete
  and to think we have to go back to
  the city to-night

            the poet

  do we

          the yokel
 i only wish that i was going back with
 you

          the athlete
 exchange this for the town

          the yokel
 this whats this

the poet luxuriously

 eden

          the yokel

 huh

          the athlete
 a place where two garments consti-
 tute respectability if not snobbishness
 a spot where such idyllic interludes are
 possible

the poet softly

the twilight before eve entered in

          the yokel
 i dont think this is much ive heard
 youve got marble tanks to swim in in the
 city

          the athlete

 dont 

the poet
they have no such perfect aftermaths


a return to eden

          the athlete
we might trv it some day in the park
ed

           the poet
dont be frivolous inspiration is in
the air

          the athlete
im not a place for sun-baths is an
idea which the park commissioners
ought to consider fenced off to avoid
consternation among the nurse-maids
and policemen-the fence painted blue
to offset ministerial objection

           the poet
such contact with nature would vital-
ize many a sapped soul it is true

           the athlete
it would strengthen encourage put
new life into a man

           the poet
  but the city is the wilderness

     the athlete ivith a sigh
paradise now-and in a few hours
starched shirts long-tailed coats and-
oh lord

           the yokel
  whats the matter with them

the poet
they were not with us in the womb

the yokel
well im not really dressed till i get
a boiled shirt and a stand-up collar on
the athlete unth a gesture of repug-
nance

  dont mention the red necktie

           the yokel

  what 

the athlete sitting up
havent you any more respect for the
play of your muscles the flexibility of
your shoulders the freedom of your
limbs

the yokel laughing

  say youre funny

  the athlete falling back again
  he has eaten of the apple

the poet
would that the leaf were still in style

the athlete
it would be too decollete at present

but fashion like history repeats itself
-the trend is favorable for its early re-
vival for this evening however i am
sure it would annoy mrs-

the poet sharply

the twilight before eve entered in 

the athlete
very well it is genuinely pleasant
to be sufficient unto oneself-even
though the shades of night are bound to
fall

          the yokel
say whats the matter with a red neck-
tie

the athlete
nothing nothing it would be ador-
able if one didnt have to wear anything

else

          the yokel
you must want to get into a daffy-
house

          the athlete
i want to absorb the strength that is
in the air and in the earth clothes are
a non-conductor

the yokel
youre looking pretty trim as it is

          the athlete
  thank you

          the yokel
  that is for a city guy

the athlete

  oh

          the yokel
if youd stay here and do ploughing
and haying and the rest of the chores
youd get real husky

the poet dreamily his eyes closed
eastward in eden he planted a gar-
den and therein he put the man whom
he had formed

the athlete
thats the way you got-husky

tiie yokel

  sure

the athlete
thats all very well but the chores i
do-in the gymnasium---train as well as
harden the muscles you ought to make
a gymnasium of the country
hilliard booth



the yokel laughing

  oh i guess im able to take care of
myself as it is

the athlete
but you dont make the most of your
opportunity the country was intended
for the enjoyment of exercise and you 
use it only as a workshop

the yokel
im not much for artificial gymnastics

the athlete sitting up

  there is nothing artificial about gym-
 nastics except the gymnasium the ma-
 jority of men have to put up with par-
 allel-bars cinder-tracks chest-weights
 and marble-lined tanks because they
 cant have the apparatus of nature-
 the trees the fields the hills the pools
 the gymnasium of the creator which
 was intended to jump to run to swim
 to train in and which you use for noth-
 ing but chores no my friend you
 have the right environment but the
 wrong idea

the yokel
well i can lick any one in the village

          the athlete
that is because they have all neglected
their gymnasium

          the yokel
  and keep their shirts on

the athlete falling back

  exactly

           tiie yokel
and i guess thats the god-fearing
way

          the athlete
which adam instituted when he
stripped the fig-tree

          the yokel
  if youd like to try a fall-

          the athlete
  in the solarium

the yokel

  huh

the athlete as the poet speaks
  shi

the poet barely audibly

   dreams yc are mine-jewels divine
      encircling my soul

          the athlete
be generous with your jewels ed if
they are genuine

the poet without opening his eyes
genuine here but in the wilderness
-paste

          the athlete
 what were you dreaming

            the poet
what i dream still-that this is the
garden in truth that we are alone in
the world that this is the beginning
on all sides of us there is nothing but
beauty in every sensation nothing but
delight in every breath full satisfaction
of body and soul we may wander at
will as we are and feel only gladness in
the warm sunshine joy in the wood-
scented air meet only the invigorating
embrace of the newborn earth we will
never know pain or suffering-they are
without being and the poison-filled form
of worry is as yet a meaningless word
life is at its most pure its most fresh
its most divine poise dreams are real-
ities realities dreams the two are one
and the one is sitting up and slapping
his arm-a mosquito

           the athtete
  the serpent in modern guise

 the poet
 tempting us to what

          the athlete
profanity continue-i was just be-
ginning to doze

the poet sinking back

no the spell is broken

the yokel thoughtfully

  say i wouldnt try walking back as
you are if i was you

          the athlete
count your ribs man count your ribs
-they are still intact

          the yokel

  huh 

            the poet
 this is a world without women

the athlete as the yokel stares
blankly

cant you imagine it

          the yokel
 give up the girls i guess not i
 know one thatd-

          the athlete
 never mind about that

          the yokel
 well i guess ive got a right to my
 opinion

           tne poet
 not in eden

          the yokel
 eden nothing i was born and
 brought up in this place and it aint
 eden i ought to know

          the athlete
 rou ought to but you dont

           the poet
 the signboard has stared you in the
 face constantly and you have never rec-
 ognized it

          the yokel
 the city for me thats all

          the athlete
 a beast in the wilderness

          the yokel
 dont want me to talk about girls eh 

           the poet
 it would be an anachronism

 here we have the serpent ed

     the yokel springing up

 call me a snake

     the athlete sitting up
 certainly-the original

the poet to the athlete

good thoughts are strength-giving
you have the advantage of him there

the athlete grasping the yokel
about the waist withstands the attack

looks on with admiration the strength
of the yokel is evidently superior but is
largely useless before the trained muscles

by e m loeb

the man came unto the seer and said

this was my dream i wandered alone in a desert weak and worn
with thirst i was-aye on the point of death and then behold 
saw before me an oasis i saw the green of palm-trees and the glitter of
water in the sunlight on my knees i groveled and crawled but when
i reached the spot where i thought to have seen it lo it had vanished then
i fell senseless on the torturing sand

    the seer pondered long then he spoke

    go and dream again for i cannot yet decipher

    the second day the man came once more unto the seer and said 

    last night this was my dream in a dark damp cell i lived miserable
starved in body and in mind but outside my window the sun shone and life
flourished free and just beyond the bars there grew a rose red as blood
and sweet-scented as spring one day i no longer was content to have this
rose as companion but longed to hold it in my hands so i thrust my arm
through the bars and plucked the flower for an instant i was completely
happy the rose was mine-mine alone but not for long for that same
day the rose faded the petals fell off the sweet scent departed forever and
it was winter in the prison

    the seer gazed at him compassionately

    the riddle is no longer a riddle he said and your days of happiness
are numbered but return and dream once more

     the third day the man returned for the last time

     this time he said i dreamed of the fields the fresh winds the scent
of many flowers and the singing of magic-voiced birds light-hearted i
spent my days in this paradise but one day a beautiful bird whose voice
far surpassed the nightingales came down from the sky and sang for me she
sang of friendship and love of the joys of heaven and of the union of souls
more wonderful than heaven i was overcome with rapture and asked the
bird to stay forever she consented on condition that i should leave eden
and have all my joy in her alone and so i contrived a cage for her fash-
ioned in gold and embellished with diamonds in it i placed the bird and left
with her for barren regions here i dwelt in a paradise in the wilderness for
many a week gradually the song of the nightingale lost in brilliancy until
the time came when her notes were unbearable then in a fury-for i had
sacrificed all for this creature-i reached through the bars and clutched the
nightingale in my fist and lo it was but a sparrow so  wrung her neck
and ground her body under my heel

     when the man had finished the seer groaned deeply

     oh wretched mortal he said within a week thou shalt be afflicted with
-a wife

     but the man departed rejoicing
the truth of it

         by arthur ulrispin jr

christine was poor proud
pretty-and proper she clerked
in the busy bee dry-goods em-
porium on elm street two doors south
of main for six dollars a week and was
subjected to no temptations or insults
holly town home of christine wasnt
that kind of place

  christine had always been proud
pretty and proper but it was only
in the last year or so that the wolf
had howled voraciously about her door
it was regrettable to say the least that
christines father had allowed his life-
insurance policy to lapse but the stark
fact remains that he had erred in that
manner and christine paid the final in-
stalment of the undertakers bill from
the proceeds of several weekly envelopes
received for laboring at the busy bee
dry-goods emporium of elm street
two doors south of main

  had hollytown been more of a me-
tropolis christines social statuts would
have changed with the depletion of her
personal means but hollytown was
hollytown and christine was christine
and so even the proprietor of the busy
bee whose wife harbored social aspira-
tions did not dare to call her by her
given name to him she had always
been miss collins and miss collins
she was destined to remain

  of course theres a man in the story
and to be still more conventional the
man was the bankers son it is always
the bankers son who falls in love with
the pretty heroine some day therell be a
small town where the bankers are bache-
lors-or are otherwise childless-and
then contemporary fiction will have un-

dergone a distinct step in the right di-
rection but hollytown boasted the
hollytown national bank and the
hollytown national bank boasted har-
rison pitt as its president and harrison
pitt boasted harrison pitt junior as his
son and there you are facts are
facts-however conventional

  harrison pitt junior was a model
young man from the top of his ultra-
correct hat to the tips of his narrow
shoes he had lived a conventional life
through school college and the first six
months of a business career during
which time he had learned to pump an
adding-machine with commendable skill

  harrison wore christines picture in
his watch and she wore his likeness in
her locket at times when neither was
working and pitt pbre was not using
their shiny new complex four harri-
son junior and christine might have
been seen bowling along at a discreet
twenty miles an hour occasionally as
they passed through sparsely-settled sec-
tions the cars speed would be reduced
to eight or ten miles an hour and har-
rison would drive with one hand allow-
ing the other the luxury of pressing
christines supple and readily yielding
waist nor did she seem to mind his
fervid caresses christine considered
herself engaged to harrison so no ques-
tion of propriety entered her mind

  like all small-town engagements it
was a secret of course harrison sen-
ior knew of it but he and his wife
looked upon it as a joke a boyish love-
affair-puppy-love or whatever it is
called he knew and he knew that the
young couple knew that it would be at


the truth of it

least two years before harrison junior
could support a wife and he realized
that his son was not of the stamp to rush
into a hasty marriage as for the young
man himself he was well content merely
to be engaged

  but on this day-of course all stories
must open on a specific day-christine
responded to his occasional kisses with
less fire than usual and harrison looked
hurt

  s matter honey he asked lightly
it will be two years or so before we
can be married wont it she asked
abruptly

  why yes i spose so what of it 
i cant continue to slave my life away
at six a week at the busy bee

  but it wont be for long-

  two years is a long time harry
im going to quit it

  quit it why how

  im going to new york

  a super-centimctre shell could have
created no greater havoc harrison pitt
juniors mind groped blindly with the
situation thus flung at his head and the
best he could do was to nod with all the
grace of an imbecile

  t-t-to new york he stammered
yes christines cheeks were beau-
tified by a high color but her even white
teeth were set firmly and her little fists
were clenched under the lap-robe-it be-
ing a bit cool that day and lap-robes
comfortable

  but-christine-for what

  to work

  youre working here

  at six dollars a week it costs me
that much to eat and rent a roof to cover
my head i need clothes and many other
things which six dollars a week wont
buy

  you can get a raise

    i can t and if i could it would be
hut a dollar a week it isnt that i think
im worth so much more than that   
but im going to new york i have the
promise of a position there

  a position  there was a gleam of
hope in harrisons eyes what sort of
xsition 

 do you remember that handsome
woman who was in town last week  the
tall blonde who stayed at the carson
house

  the very proper eyes of the young
man opened wider very well indeed
did he remember the flamboyant creature
of whom christine spoke

  yes

  she was a traveling saleswoman for
the phoenix ladies ready-to-wear
house she sold the busy bee some stuff
and thats where i met her

  and it was through her that you re-
ceived this offer

  exactly

  with the phoenix company

  yes

  what sort of position is it

  im to go there at twelve dollars a
week to start with as-a model very
discreetly christine smiled she had
carefully calculated her words to pro-
duce an untoward effect and they did

  model the word of horror rolled
fearfully from harrison pitts tongue
he had read a bit himself and while his
ideas of models were hazy-ras applied
to the cloak and suit trade-lie had an
idea they spent most of their lime in ex-
treme negligee stretched luxuriously on
tiger-rugs a turkish cigarette in one
hand and a glass of champagne in the
other

  a model he repeated

  a cj-model harry i see you
have the wrong- idea i shall wear all
my clothes-and cloaks over   

 but-but- his wits were still
busy with the picture the word moder
had conjured

  the blonde woman says i am a per-
fect thirty-six christine continued in
a business-like tone

  a perfect thirty-six he murmured
absently and this time christine flushed

  then they talked the afternoon away
arthur crispin jr



harrison advancing strenuous protest
after strenuous protest all of which the
girl swept aside with a celerity which
betokened careful forethought that
night she mentioned to one or two other
persons in hollytown that she thought
of going to new york and by the next
morning she was the cynosure of all
eyes

  it was her uncle-in-law a portly
gentleman of dignified demeanor and dea-
conish whiskers who cornered her that
night after the closing of the busy bee
dry-goods emporiums doors and for
a half-hour without so much as a pause
for breath this gentleman held forth on
the dangers of the big city

  christine turned a willing ear to his
exhortations she admitted that she
knew new tork was populated by two
million five hundred thousand masculine
devils who waylaid girls on each and
every corner with patented and unpat-
ented plans leading to their ruin and
that she realized that good-looking miss-
es must be ever on the alert but she put
the proposition straight to her benevo-
lent uncle-in-law

  i cant live decently on the money i
earn here so what am i to do

  he reneged a bit on that there was
no offer of additional coin to defray
lifes necessities and when she re-
mained firm in her determination to risk
the pitfalls of gotham he waddled away
shaking his pudgy features and mutter-
ing dire prophecies

  in truth christine was nervous her-
self she was no fool and she had seen
such plays as help wanted she real-
ized that the straight and narrow path
in new york was bounded on both sides
by rose-bowers champagne millionaires
taxicabs hot birds broiled lobsters and
houses of bondage but she reasoned
other girls had lived through it unsullied
and there was no reason why she might
not

  between the announcement of her de-
termination and the day when the puffy

little engine snorted its disgust at any
female of the species fool enough to
leave the innocuous desuetude of holly-
town for the hurly-burly of new york
-and thereupon carried her flying
toward that iniquitous city-christine
was beset by hordes of friends world-
wise and world-ignorant who regaled
her with multicolored accounts of the
dangers which awaited her and pre-
scribed the latest approved methods of
getting around them they furnished a
verbal baedeker of the citys evils and
when christine lay back in the stuffy
red-velvet-covered seat in the day-coach
as the train pulled out of the tiny depot
for new york she felt a thoroughly
feminine desire to cry and to back out
at this thirteenth hour and only her
pride prevented

  ten hours later the train was in new
york and christine summoned her en-
ergies and moved her cramped muscles
she stepped on to the concrete platform
mounted innumerable stairs and gazed
awe-stricken at the tremendous dome of
the pennsylvania station thereupon
she timidly pursued her way to seventh
avenue eying every man askance and
fearing attack with each step she re-
read the letter of directions written her
by the blonde woman who had secured
her the position and in due course of
time came to the dingy red-brick-front
boarding-house on west twenty-third
street

  there gentle reader-i caught you
smiling that time you are now pre-
pared to peruse the story of her life in
this house of impropriety to which she
has been lured a tale of knockout drops
and the rest of the white-slave formula
so was christine but you-and she
will be disappointed

  the house was run by a broad-bos-
omed healthily-hipped mrs patrick
omalley and was painfully respectable
its clientele of boarders consisted of sev-
eral shopgirls two laundry-clerks a
salesman of cigars and a dancing-mis-


the truth ok it

tress save for the fact that the sales-
man of cigars was inclined to be flirta-
tious in an entirely harmless way no
temptation strayed within the portals of
the house-as a jingle meal told chris-
tine and she breathed more easily in the
knowdge that here at least she might
find sanctuary in fact she had occa-
sion to pink a little when mrs omalley
informed her in a motherly but none-
theless positive manner that her board-
ers were ladies and gentlemen and that
when they ceased to come within that
classification they would be cordially in-
vited to leave

   the next morning christine presented
herself at the phoenix companys sixth
avenue store where she was met by the
effusive and perfumed blonde lady and
introduced to the store-manager a pursy
little man who eyed that which made
christine a perfect thirty-six in a critical
and wholly professional manner and
thelittle country girl was duly installed
as a model under the direction of a
certain miss yvonne riley she learned
her new duties readily and within three
days had settled into a rut of routine

   two months passed during which a
trip to coney island and an ensuing case
of indigestion furnished the only real
excitement the flirtatious cigar sales-
man had been her companion and he
hadnt tried to hug her even when they
shot the chutes and roller-coasted to-
gether at which  shamefacedly admit
christine was a mite disappointed nor
in all that time had the pursy manager
told her that lie was unhappily married
and desired a soul-mate in brief she
found new york dull and she was ter-
ribly lonely

  and then at the end of the two
 months she met her first millionaire and
 once more girded on her steel armor-
 figuratively speaking

   the millionaire in question one thad-
  deus spencer entered the phoenix one
  day with a handsomely-gowned regal
  woman he assisted her in the selection

of several garments his taste proving
suspiciously expert christine was their
model and in the course of business the
pursy manager who knew mr spencer
and was as obsequious as his millions de-
manded introduced him to christine
he also introduced the woman and
christine had her first distinct surprise
the woman was not the mans wife nor
did she occupy any equivocal position
she was his sister

  and eventually the millionaire left
but he was back the next day and the v
next and the next and then the sales-
ladies did start the ball of gossip whirl-
ing there wasnt a doubt of it as miss
yvonne riley put it he had fell for
christine an fell hard

  with a realization of that fact as a
fact there came to christine an almost
unholy joy here at least was oppor-
tunity for that zest of danger which she
had secretly craved but the innate pro-
priety of her the inherent small-town
narrowness the inborn sense of caution
prompted her to refuse his first dinner
invitation whereupon he smiled slight-
ly and the next day his sister appeared
and invited christine to go for a motor-
ride over the hudson boulevard in jer-
sey the following sunday mrs grundy
having been satisfied christine accepted
and the following sunday was a day of
joy

  less than a week later she dined at
churchills with mr thaddeus spenc-
er-unchaperoned

  of course she wasnt blind to his in-
tentions she knew well that million-
aires didnt run after cloak-models with
offers of marriage but by this time she
felt almost painfully able to guard her
virtue and her little trips with him be-
came semi-weekly occurrences as for
mr spencer he conducted himself as
befitted a millionaire and a gentleman
but christine knew full well that the
clouds were gathering and that sooner
or later the storm would break and
then back to her existence of loneliness
arthur crispin jr



and her twelve dollars a week to spend
with no excitement-now that the flir-
tatious salesman had suddenly married a
manicure who lived down the street
and had left the boarding-house

  then it was that the phoenix com-
pany went to the wall and christine
was out of a job at a time when jobs
were scarcer than the proverbial hens
teeth

  but christine was still in the ring
she withdrew from a department-store
savings-bank the little money that she
had saved and valiantly trudged the
rounds of the stores applying for a job
invariably they either told her that there
was no opening or else they took her
name and said theyd notify her if a va-
cancy occurred but no job nor did
any sleek proprietor attempt to kiss her
or tell her that she was worth more than
ten dollars a week and offer to show her
how to make fifty or a hundred

  so it was that eventually through the
machinations-or assistance call it what
you will-of the original blonde lady
who had-to use hollytowns phrase-
lured her to the city christine secured
a job in the chorus of the golden
ring her salary was fixed at eighteen
dollars a week and she proved an apt
pupil she opened with the show in pat-
erson and stayed with it during its new
york run

  the golden ring was three degrees
removed from a leg-show it boasted
co-stars and book and lyrics by well-
known perpetrators of revivers for tired
business men its comedy lines were
good and it drew the crowd for a
while

  and during that time christine bad
her initial experience with a stage-door
johnny she had her only experience
with a stage-door johnny she and two
other pulchritudinous chorus-ladies were
met at the stage-entrance by three even-
ing-dressed silk-hatted young dandies
each boasting an automobile they
bowed and stepped forward simulta-

neously one of them linked an arm con-
fidingly through christines

  hullo he greeted how about a
bit of supper

  christines body tensed here was
danger-with a capital d here was
the ravening wolf who preyed on wom-
en her arm dropped and she faced
him her outward calm giving the lie to
the inward seething

  youve made a mistake she re-
marked icily

  the young man stepped back and
bowed courteously

  pardon me he said suavely my
fault and christine walked home un-
molested

  nor was she troubled after that pos-
sibly her reputation for virtue spread
at any rate save for an occasional wink
no other stage-door johnny made any
advances to her and although she did
not analyze her feelings she felt slightly
disappointed about it all

  during all this time mr thaddtus
spencer continued his attack on her
citadel he was gentlemanly and cir-
cumspect but she did not misunder-
stand she knew that he was what they
called in the parlance of the city a
wise one no bungling of such a deli-
cate job by him

  so things went for the four months
run of the golden ring then the
show closed for the season and chris-
tine now well dressed and with some
money saved from week to week and
thoroughly confident that her virtue was
as safe as though it had been placed
under lock and key in a bank-vault de-
termined to return to hollytown there
at least she would get away from the
fictionized fetidness of the city with its
ever-ready pitfalls and dangers

  the night before her departure she
motored and dined with thaddeus
spencer that is she dined first and
then she motored

  it was as they were traversing a par-
ticularly dark and silent stretch of road
i

the truth of it

that he turned to her and she realized
with a thrill half of fear and half of a
not undelightful anticipation that at last
his full purpose was to be disclosed his
voice was thick and hoarse and he closed
one hot hand over hers before she could
draw back she chilled in every fibre of
her being-as the novelists put it-and
jerked away

  you forget yourself mr spencer
she snapped

  and then he apologized humbly
turned his car sped it downtown and
left her at her boarding-house

  that night she pondered many things
and chief among them was the manner
in which thaddeus spencer had proven
true lo fiction by his dastardly attempt
on her-thats the way she characterized
it at any rate-and she thought of the
return to the quaint puritanical church-
going little town which was her home
and of harrison pitt junior die bankers
son and the next evening she was back
in holly town

  she registered at the carson house
hollytowns single hostelry the night-
clerk winked at her and she flamed with
indignation her uncle-in-law met her
that evening and eyed her in a manner
that brought a flush to her cheeks

  youve disgraced the family he
flamed lby becomin a common chorus-
girl 

  next morning she dropped in at the
busy bee dry-goods emporium on
elm street two doors south of main
the female clerks eyed her metropolitan
attire with open admiration and allowed
that the life of a chorus-girl must be
grand and exciting they called her
christine the little proprietor hus-
tled forward and invited her into his pri-
vate office she went to talk of om
times and he told her a joke with a
double-meaning then his wife came in
and forbade him to have further confab
with that hussy

  at four oclock that afternoon chris-
tine telephoned harrison pm junior at

the bank he said hed come for her
in the family car at five his voice
radiated a patent tremble

  he called they drove into the coun-
try once out of the town he slipped
an arm around her waist and she al-
lowed it he kissed her-and then she
pulled away suddenly and sharply the
kiss was not the kiss she had expected
from him it was an insult she noti-
fied him brusquely that their engagement
was at an end

  of course it is he returned a bit
nastily dyou think id marry a cho-
rus-girl i suppose you have friends
back in the city

  she didnt answer hut that night she
returned to new york the mecca of
evil-doers the concentration of lures and
insults and pitfalls and she telephoned
thaddeus spencer that she was back

  he broke a business engagement and
came for her in his high-powered road-
ster they were silent until they had
passed grants tomb on riverside and
then she turned to him with a direct
question

  the last time we drove up this way
together said she you took my hand
you had acted peculiarly all evening
what was it you wanted of me

  his eyes popped wide open

  i-i-wanted to marry you he
gasped

  she gasped too but retained control
of herself

  you still wish to

  yes i-i-love you

  the girl looked at the man beside her
and then at the stark skyline of the city
she shifted her gaze across the hudson
and looked in the general direction of
puritanval hollytown then she slipped
her hand into his and nestled close

   didnt realize it before she said
softly but i love you too

  ard so to wind up the story in the
proper and conventional manner they
were married and lived happily ever af-
terwards
confessions of a fashion-
able practitioner

anonymous
i-the green orchid

somewhere in my memory there
lingers the vague recollection of
a quotation to the effect that
the family doctor is father confessor
first priest afterward i dont know
when it was said or by whom but
it comes perilously near to the truth

  professional ethics seals more se-
crets than the confessional and in his
capacity of healer of sick bodies the
physician is frequently called upon to
minister to sick souls-to say nothing of
the opportunities that come to him to ob-
serve family skeletons

  i am aware that to open the door of
the closet may be regarded as a violation
of those same professional ethics of
which i speak but there is no possibility
that any of my dramatis persona could
ever be connected with those who ac-
tually played the roles in life i am con-
fident that i have provided them with
disguises sufficient to insure against rec-
ognition  and chief among these must be
my own anonymity

  when i graduated from one of the
big eastern universities the choice of a
profession was open to me i chose
medicine for two reasons because i
was genuinely enthusiastic over it and
because i wanted to study human na-
ture

  with the attainment of my degree and
the completion of my hospital work
came the question where to settle not
desiring to emulate the prophet of bib-
lical fame and numberless other indi-
viduals of no fame whatever i decided
against my birthplace and in favor of a

neighboring city which for the sake of
convenience i shall call cinnapolis-al-
though that is not its name

  there was never any doubt of my suc-
cess my people were well off well con-
nected and favorably known all through
the vicinity i had a good establishment
plenty of money and-a reputation as
an auction-player almost before i real-
ized it i found myself in possession of
a large and growing practice

  my patients were all wealthy-most of
them belonged to the class which is
spoken of as the idle rich-and their
ailments were largely imaginary putting
no great tax on my powers it is aston-
ishing how many and how varied can be
the complaints of a woman who has
nothing with which to occupy her mind
or a man whose sole business in life is
to kill time

  being presentable in appearance well
born decently bred and unmarried i
was immediately received on a footing
of friendly equality in most of the houses
where my professional services w-ere re-
quired  and having as i have mentioned
a keen interest in human nature i grad-
ually acquired a store of knowledge con-
cerning those whose names appeared in
the society columns of the cinnapolis
papers that if revealed would have
shaken the social structure to its founda-
tions

  but i kept my eyes and ears open and
my mouth shut and i continued to
dance with debutantes matrons and
dowagers and play cards with their
brothers husbands and lovers o nights




confessions of a fashionable practitioner

while prescribing for them more or less
harmless cures during otficc-hours and
professional calls for the results inci-
dent to their pursuit of pleasure they
religiously took my medicine and-infre-
quently-my advice they even paid
mv outrageous charges without a mur-
mur if one wishes to keep up with the
fashion one must be willing to pay the
price and in cinnapolis i was the fash-
ion no family laying the slightest
claim to standing would have even re-
motely considered being indisposed with-
out sending for me to summon an-
other physician would have been a sign
of financial disability a fashion is-a
fashion

  but there was one woman w ho sedu-
lously refrained from following the gen-
era example her husband belonged to
ore of the oldest families in the city
and her father was enormously wealthy
the president of the largest bank in
cinnapolis and a director in most of the
others as well as a power in local and
state politics thus mary hermon could
afford to do as she chose she did not
choose my services

  why theres nothing ever the matter
with me she declared gaily one even-
ing when one of her friends laughingly
inquired why she persisted in sticking
to a stodgy old practitioner when there
was a younger and much more attract-
ive one at hand

  i never need a doctor said mary
hermon

  and the next day the bay team of old
doctor banks switched their long tails
before the door of the big hermon
house for an hour it was not to see
mrs hermon however that banks had
been summoned her husband had been
taken suddenly and alarmingly ill

  rotten sense jim hermons got
banks informed me disgustedly when i
chanced to meet him a few da vs later

   he will drink and it lays him up every
time ever since he came back from
that central american place alcohol in

any form is so much poison to him
hes all right-until some one asks him
to take a drink and then he cuts loose
ive warned him time and again but i
might as well save my breath one of
these fine days hell take a glass too
much and then- banks lifted his
fat hands upward and pursed his lips

  why not speak to his wife i sug-
gested

  oh i leave the women to you you
like to talk to em said he and shuf-
fled away

  i was always glad to talk to mary
hermon of all the women in the smart
set of cinnapolis she interested me most
perhaps a year or two under thirty
rather small and slight with big dark
eyes and a great quantity of blue-black
hair she was on occasion the most
beautiful woman i had ever seen there
were other times when she appeared al-
most plain and a surreptitious study
revealed to me the fact that her beauty
depended entirely on her expression and
further that her expression depended
solely upon the presence or absence of
her husband

  she was very quiet she talked little
and i had never heard her laugh aloud
biu the heat of a fire does not depend on
the height of the flames and the most in-
tense natures are often those hidden be-
neath the mst placid surfaces mary
hermon loved her husband with a pas-
sion that amounted almost to idolatry
when he was with her her face was
illumined with an animation that made
her wonderful without him she was
an unlighted lamp

  there was nothing particularly re-
markable about hermon that i could see
to inspire such a love he was tall and
fair his shoulders stooped slightly and
he had a tendency to stoutness-a ten-
dency that would assert itself emphat-
ically later on in life

  personally i disliked him there had
been some uly stories afloat regarding
his habits before his marriage and al-
anonymous



though he was supposed to have steadied
down i had my doubts a man doesnt
run after one woman for years marry
another and then risk his life to please
the vanity of the first one if he is pre-
pared to settle down quietly in double
harness

  besides if there were any truth in
the stories of his conduct on his first
exploring expedition he had gone to
central america at the behest of a group
of archaeologists who set great store by
him his wife was to be pitied-quite
as much as the native women of his
treatment of whom even the most hard-
ened among his companions spoke with
loathing he certainly had ability in his
own line but few women are interested
in prehistoric ruins and mary hermon
was not one of the few she was vitally
alive a veritable little flame of intensity
she had been deeply in love with her-
mon for years before her marriage to
him-the whole time indeed that he had
pursued another woman

  that woman was orchid parry the
name orchid suited her perfectly she
was an exotic of the most pronounced
type no one seemed to know very
much about her antecedents but she ap-
peared to have unlimited money at com-
mand and the house that she occupied
with an englishwoman who acted as
companion and chaperon was though
small one of the most exquisitely fur-
nished and appointed in cinnapolis i
know for i have been in it

  she went everywhere knew every one
the women hated her-and invited her
to their houses-possibly at the com-
mand or behest of the men who were her
slaves she might have married a dozen
times had she desired but she remained
single and let half the males of the city
singe their wings

  of all those who had desired and
sought to win her tim hermon had been
the most dogged in his pursuit bets
had been laid at the calabash club three
to one against his success jim had fam-

ily but little money-and orchids are ex-
pensive it was conceded that she had
refused him finally and that when he
returned from his year in central amer-
ica he would turn his attention else-
where he did-to mar- rice inside
of three months from his reappearance
in the city they were married

  it was publicly supposed that hermon
had accomplished nothing brought back
nothing from his trip save a lightened
pocketbook and an impaired digestion
the group of scientists who had sent
him out promptly severed all connection
with him and it was said that there had
been a stormy time between them

  but there was a far more important
reason for this step on their part than
hermons mere failure to attain the ob-
ject of the expedition the inside facts
in the case were hushed up but it was
not long before it came to my knowledge
that hermon had brought something
back with him-a new and extraordinary
orchid sea-green in color and in shape
not unlike a bat with outspread wings

  this treasure-trove he had calmly ap-
propriated claiming ownership by right
of discovery his colleagues on their
part fclaimed it because they had fi-
nanced the expedition and he was tech-
nically in their employ but possession
being nine points of the law they were
unable to make good their claim there
was no suit brought hermon was sim-
ply dropped and blacklisted

  i believe it was a severe blow to him
at least it deprived him of any further
opportunities to distinguish himself in
his work in which he had begun to make
an enviable name for himself it also
deprived him of his income

  remained then only the priceless new
orchid-and orchid parry wore one of
the strange blossoms when she attended
the smart wedding of hermon and mary
rice thereafter she never appeared
in public without one or more fastened
at her breast

  slim and lithe and sinuous with hair


confessions of a fashionable practitioner

the color of dull gold and eyes as narrow
and pointed as those of an oriental she
was a remarkable-looking woman her
evening gowns cut daringly low to show
the perfection of white neck and shoul-
ders were invariably of green pale
gleaming exactly the shade of the irises
of her slanting eyes she was easily the
most conspicuous figure in cinnapolis
society and always amid the froth of
lace at her breast nestled a sea-green
orchid like some smooth bat-winged
moth of mystery

  then abruptly she ceased to wear it
and three weeks later jim hermon de-
parted again for central america he
was gone four months when he re-
turned he sent a large package to the
house of orchid parry but he did not
himself go near the house or her he
had been some two months at home
when he experienced the attack of which
banks had spoken to me-and orchid
parry was wearing her exotic blossoms
again

  so far as i was concerned there was
no particular puzzle about the affair it
resolved itself into the following factors

  jim hermon had lost his head over
orchid parry he had presented to her
the parasitic plant which he had found
on his first exploratory expedition and
had gotten himself in bad odor with his
colleagues as a result evidently the
orchid had been insufficient price for the
lady and hermon had married mary
rice either in a fit of pique or because
of her immense fortune i thought the
prcbabilities were in favor of the latter
hypothesis

  unquestionably aware of her hus-
bands feeling for orchid parry-all
cinnapolis knew of it-mary hermon
had set herself to work to win his love
for herself if he did not really re-
spond at least he made a respectable
showing then miss parry had taken a
hand in the game again the absence of
the orchid from her costume argued that
the plant-or plants-had died and she

had induced hermon to go in search of
another

  so much was clear to me the only
question in my mind was what did her-
mon expect to receive from the lady as
a reward for his perilous trip it would
not be in money-for the green orchid
was priceless connoisseurs had offered
fabulous sums for a root but miss
parry had laughed at the idea of selling
it so far as  had been able to find out
no one had so much as seen it growing
she would permit no one to touch the
blooms and burned them when they
faded that was just the sort of thing
that appealed to her she liked myster-
ies and enigmas-they were the breath of
life to her she was one herself

  i could not readily account for the
fact that gossip had failed to link her-
mon with the orchid his foggy ex-
planation that he had made his second
trip for the purpose of finding the ruins
he had failed to locate on his first was
no explanation at all since he had been
shut out from scientific circles

  yet it was accepted readily enough
possibly because as i have before men-
tioned he was supposed to have settled
down since his marriage and because
he carefully kept out of orchid parrys
way but that there was a little cu-
riosity current became evident to me
one evening when i was attending a
dance at mrs palmerstons i had
greeted my hostess and was standing be-
side a bank of palms which screened an
alcove formed by the immense bow-win-
dows when young joe wheeler touched
me on the arm

  i say doctor said he dont you
suppose theres some connection between
jim hermon and the green orchid

  certainly not i said promptly
not the slightest chance of it i had
an excellent reason for lying mary
hermon was standing within two feet
of me concealed from wheelers view
by the spreading branches of the palms

  oh he said the idea just occurred
anonymous



to me thats all i saw them together
and he looked as if he wanted to eat her
up he moved away and an instant
later i found myself looking into mary
hermons stormy eyes

  thank you doctor she said it
isnt every one who would have missed
such a chance to roll the ball of scandal
along

  there was no use pretending to mis-
understand

  i could see nothing to be gained mrs
hermon i said and besides thats
all in the past

  is it she made a gesture with her
fan and i followed the direction of her
gaze

  through a break in the crowd i could
see the lithe sinuous figure of orchid
parry and by her side was jim her-
mon they were standing by an onyx
table which supported a huge silver
punch-bowl and hermon who had ap-
parently just handed a glass to his com-
panion was raising one to his own lips

  oh he mustnt i heard the
woman beside me exclaim he
mustnt she made an agitated move-
ment forward then stopped and the
mother-o-pearl sticks of her fan snapped
in her fingers for orchid parrys hand
was suddenly raised and laid on jim
hermons wrist he set his glass down
untasted and they moved away from the
bowl then the crowd closed in and hid
them from view

  i glanced down at mary hermon
her head was thrust a little forward
and her upper lip was drawn back from
her white teeth the flame of the poin-
settias at her breast was as nothing to
that in her eyes she looked like a
small vicious animal at bay and ready
to spring every muscle was taut and
she was quivering from head to foot

  look here mrs hermon i said
this wont do relax-relax you
keep up this sort of thing and youll
snap the human organism can stand
just so much and no more

  she seemed not to have heard me

  she shant have him she shant
have him she was whispering over and
over again to herself beating one savage
little hand against her thigh the while
then abruptly she left me edging along
the wall in the direction which her hus-
band and orchid parry had taken

  my attention was no longer on mrs
palmerstons dance and her guests i
was far more concerned with the drama
of human interest that was being played
before me i crossed the hall ascended
the stairs and made my way to a room
at the back of the house which palmer-
ston called his den it was a splendid
apartment done in magnificent tooled
leather with great english club-chairs
and deep couches scattered about there
was no one there the lights were low-
ered  i found the switch and put them
out i wanted to think

  either my diagnosis was radically
wrong or mary hermon was on the
verge of a complete mental collapse she
was wrought up to a dangerous pitch
and her condition was critical because
of her habitual repression it is only the
confined explosive that is dangerous

  orchid parrys action in restraining
hermon from drinking the punch had
shown clearly that she knew he was un-
der instructions to touch nothing alcohol-
ic was it this or the intimacy of the
gesture with which she had laid her hand
on his that had set the match to the tow
of his wifes jealousy

  why i asked myself cant she
leave him alone hes been trying to
break loose why doesnt she let him
go

  the question was one that practically
answered itself but even while i was
considering that curious mental twist
possessed by some women-the dog-in-
the-manager spider-and-fly cat-and-
mouse combination that absolutely
refuses to loose a victim-i thought i
heard a sound as of a door opening be-
hind me an instant later i decided that
ft

confessions of a fashionable practitioner

it must have come from the hall for
the doorway was darkened by two fig-
ures a man and a woman the light
from the electrolier shone on the high-
piled dull gold hair of orchid parry
and flashed from the necklace of
aquamarines about her throat

  theres no one here orchid- it
was hermons voice come in

  well be missed she demurred but
there was no reluctance in her manner
as she followed him a few steps into the
room i was about to rise and make my
presence known when he turned and
grasped her hands roughly

  when  he demanded hoarsely
when 

  youve put me off long enough i
asked you-when his voice was thick
and ragged

  she did not answer

  are you going to ask for more time 
holding both of her hands in one of his
he put the other under her chin and
turned her face to the light

  orchid parry was not a beautiful
woman she was too bizarre too spec-
tacular for real beauty but in that mo-
ment her face was transfigured what-
ever motives had actuated her in the
past when she had cajoled flouted and
tormented this man she was now ready
to yield to him blinded by the strength
of his own desire he could not read what
was as plain as print to me

  answer me he commanded

  no jim her voice was as softly
seductive as the arms she twined about
his neck i-im not going to ask for
any more time

  then- his set face was within
an inch of hers

  to-morrow night she breathed

  with a muffled cry he caught her to
him

  sheer stark passion is not a pretty
sight to see i looked away and then
all at once i made out another figure in
the gloom no need to wonder who it

was she was leaning forward and her
facc was contorted into a tortured mask

  jim we must go back well be
missed orchid parry had freed her-
self from hermons embrace and was
adjusting the crumpled laces of her
gown the green orchid fell to the floor
at his feet he picked it up tore off one
of the wing-like petals and thrust it into
his breast-pocket

  she uttered a little cry of protest

  jim i told you it was the last one

  well shall i go and get you an-
other the first plant cost me my busi- -
ness integrity the second nearly cost me
my life do you want me to try again 
he was brutally ironical

  she shook her head

  i want nothing now-but you she
murmured

  and that english nuisance he asked
her while she fastened the maimed blos-
som in its place

  ill send her away jim therell be
no one there-no one but just us two
she turned toward the door flashing
him a swift seductive smile he bent
forward and laid his lips on her bare
shoulder

  god he said the years youve
wasted orchid

  i looked at the spot wheremary her-
mon had been standing she was not
there she was not in the room and
though there was a door behind me it
was closed had my imagination played
me a trick it seemed so yet i could
have sworn that i had seen her there
watching the revolting spectacle of her
husbands mad passion for another
woman

  i met her on the stairs twenty minutes
later and she smiled at me pleasantly
placidly almost i decided that i must
have been mistaken in supposing that
she had followed her husband and
orchid parry the two were standing
together in the hall below she looked
down at them with an expression that
was quite apathetic there was no ani-
anonymous



mation in her face and i thought i had
never seen her look so nearly plain

  i spent an interested half-hour the
next day piecing out the psychology of
my drama and fitting the sections to-
gether they formed the inevitable tri-
angle but a rather unusual aspect of it

  orchid parry had never had the slight-
est use for jim hermon-except the per-
verted pleasure a woman of her type de-
rives from tormenting a man-until he
ceased to importune her she had
abused herself at his expense she had
rained his career and sent him out to
risk his life simply that her morbid
vanity might be gratified that she might
have a unique specimen of her name-
flower she had unquestionably prom-
ised to give him herself as a reward for
the hesperian apples as typified by the
green orchid and then coolly defaulted
payment now when there was no
longer any question of payment when
he had voluntarily raised the siege the
citadel was ready to surrender once
he had been valueless now quite un-
reasonably after the manner of her kind
she wanted him and she would take
him just as ruthlessly as she had cast
him aside

  but what of his wife that was the
thought that kept recurring to me all
day when on driving past the station
i saw the english nuisance boarding
a train and knew that orchid had sent
her away the thought obtruded itself
more insistently than ever what of
mary hermon

  if she had really been behind me in
palmerstons room the previous night
would she stand tamely by and allow her
husband to go to orchid parry if i
had read her aright she would not yet
after all what could she do she might
prevent his going that night but there
were other nights she might leave
him it would suit him perfectly she
might drag the other womans name
through the mire of scandal but the
other woman would have jim hermon

  he was an unscrupulous cad a liber-
tine-and worse  but there is no account-
ing for a womans love if hermon had
been true to his wife it was simply be-
cause orchid parry would have none of
him yet here was his wife burning her-
self out with a fierce passion for the man
who didnt want her and who was him-
self consumed with desire for some one
else

  my sympathy was all for the wife
perhaps because i liked her while i de-
tested hermon and distrusted orchid
parry and perhaps because in spite of
her fragility there was nothing craven
or cowardly about mary hermon that
which was hers she would fight to keep
and somehow i had a feeling that she
would keep it i hoped she would-
utterly worthless though it seemed to me

  it must have been about ten oclock
that night wh i the telephone-bell in my
study rang it was a private telephone
unlisted and not more than a dozen peo-
ple knew the number the regular tele-
phone was downstairs in the office of my
assistant with an extension connected
with his bedroom on the third floor

  i was tired and disinclined for pro-
fessional or other conversation for a
moment i debated whether or not to
answer the call then i stretched out
my hand for the instrument

  hello it was a womans voice
with just a trace of french accent is
that you doctor

  yes i said who is it

  this is mrs hcrmons maid speak-
ing mrs hermon-mrs james her-
mon-would be greatly obliged if you
could come down at once

  in less than fifteen minutes i was
shown into mary hermons room

  she was lying on a couch piled high
with gorgeous pillows the masses of
her hair fell in a blue-black cascade over
her shoulders and across the folds of her
rose-colored robe

  my head hurts so doctor she said
plaintively cant you help me


confessions of a fashionable practitioner

  i can try i said and drew up a
chair beside the couch her pulse was
fast and very uneven there was a good
deal of color in her usually pale cheeks
and the pupils of her eyes were dilated
so that they almost covered the iris she
had a temperature of  no wonder
her head ached the collapse i had
foreseen had come perhaps-if it were
not too late-orchid parrys net might
be broken i felt a grim satisfaction at
the thought

  wheres mr hermon i asked

   she gave a little sigh

  am i as sick as all that well-
jims in his library at least he said
he was going to be busy this evening
looking up some references i havent
seen him since luncheon shall i send
annette for him

  no ill go i said i want to speak
to him tell annette to get you to bed
ill be back again in a few minutes i
rose to my feet and pocketed my ther-
mometer as i did so i caught the
odor of her breath it fairly reeked of
brandy most certainly she had been
drinking-a good deal yet i happened
to know that she loathed liquor in any
form and never touched it

  poor child certainly she had borne
her trouble bravely had she been
driven to seek that will-o-the-wisp-for-
getfulness she looked so frail and
girlish lying back among the silken pil-
lows that i felt a sudden surge of anger
against her husband and against orchid
parry

  i did not expect to find him in the
house doubtless he had already gone
to keep his tryst but there was a pos-
sibility of his being still in his study i
went down the long hall to the room at
the end knocked and receiving no an-
swer turned the knob the room was
brightly lighted i stepped within

    mr hermon i said but hermon
did not turn he was sitting with his
back to me beside a small table on which
stood an almost empty decanter a

siphon and two glasses there was
something in his pose something in the
way his head lolled back against the
leather cushions of his chair that made
me start hurriedly to his side

  he had been dead some time already
rigor mortis was beginning to set in
there was a rim on the inside of the
decanter showing me exactly how much
of the brandy had been used it was a
good deal and alcohol was a virulent
poison to hermon

  but why knowing this had he drunk
so freely how had he come to forget
what banks had told him i was puz-
zled for an instant then as a small ob-
ject lying on the white rug beside the
body caught my eye a light suddenly
dawned on me this was not a case of
unintentional suicide the tzuo glasses
on the table the reek of brandy on mary
hermons breath the small object i had
picked up from the rug-the wilted petal
of a sea-green orchid in shape not un-
like the wing of a bat and ground al-
most to a pulp by a womans small high
heel-was any further evidence needed

  as i turned to leave the room the
telephone on a small stand in the com- r
rang musically i answered the call

  hello is that you jim i recog-
nized orchid parrys voice  what is
keeping you  do you-

  this is not mr hermon i inter-
rupted he-and i paused an instant
before driving the blow home-he is
dead who is this speaking

  a gasping cry that ended in a shriek
answered me i was conscious of a feel-
ing of grim gratification as i replaced
the instrument on the stand and went
back to mary hennons room orchid
parry would pay now-but not in the
coin she had expected

  annette had put her mistress to bed
and was awaiting instructions i sent
her to telephone to banks asking him to
come up at once then i went to the
side of the bed and looked down at mary
hermon
anonymous



why did you do it i asked quietly
she did not speak but the color ebbed
swiftly from her cheeks and her eyes
seemed to grow larger and blacker in her
small white face

  you were with him i accused her
you knew brandy was so much poison
to him-and you persuaded him to drink
with you why did you do it

  for a full minute she did not answer
then

  you were there last night she said
you heard you-saw he was going
to her-to-night you know it i
couldnt keep him-to myself-any-
other-way

  do you realize  asked her what
you have done

 she nodded

tve killed him-yes i realize it i
did it on purpose i wanted to he was
mine wasnt he

  his life was not yours to take i
said sternly you committed murder
does it matter what you call it she
asked wearily i shouldnt have done
it only-i had to i told him id fol-
lowed him last night and heard what
he was going to do i begged him not to
go he laughed at me he said hed
go if he had to crawl on his hands and
knees he meant it then i told him
i hadnt understood that he cared so
much that if he really loved her i
wouldnt stand in his way oh no
she laughed a quiet mirthless laugh
that sent a chill over me

  i told him to go-that i wished him
good luck and happiness again that
laugh then i suggested that we have
a last drink together because i was go-
ing away in the morning and wouldnt
trouble him any more he was so glad
that i was going to be so easily disposed
of he forgot all about what doctor
banks had told him funny wasnt it
i filled his glass and he patted me on the
shoulder and said i was a good little
scout and he was sorry hed treated me
badly and then-we drank

  in spite of myself i shuddered

  jim never could stop at one drink
she went on in her slow drawling voice
he had seveial and then-he just put
his head back-and died he died my
jim died and i came in here and sent
for you will you call that woman up
please and tell her that jim isnt com-
ing because hes dead id like her to
know that shell never get him now
hes still mine and i took that green
flower-thing she gave him out of his
pocket and trampled on it i didnt want
anything of hers to touch him tell her
that too please

  of a sudden her voice changed the
light went out from her eyes they
looked like two burned-out coals in the
gray of her convulsed face

  i loved him she said in a dreadful
dry whisper i loved him-and i killed
him hes dead hell never hold me
in his arms any more-never kiss me
jims dead but he was mine-all mine
she never had him he didnt want me
-he wanted her but-i kept him he
was never hers-do you understand-
never - never - never her voice
mounted in shrill crescendo as she
raised herself on her elbows

  she tried to take him away from me
shes a devil a smooth slimy devil like
that horrible plant he gave her-a de il
with green eyes that stare and stare   
but hes dead and hell never hold her
in his arms as he held me-hell never
be to her what he was to me oh jim
   jim    jim   her tense
muscles suddenly relaxed and she sank
weakly back among the pillows

  i never thought youd know she
whispered faintly i never thought any
one would know but-i had to do it
i-loved him her eyes closed and
she lay there white and still

  no mary hermon did not die al-
though for weeks she hovered between
life and death and her sanity hung in
the balance i see her sometimes a frail
little slip of a woman with big dark


longing

eyes and a mass of blue-black hair fram-
ing a pale plain face she seldom smiles
and never laughs

  doctor banks confirmed my diagnosis
that hermon had died from the effects
of alcoholic poisoning and the autopsy
which the family thought advisable vin-
dicated our combined opinions banks

was so sure of himself that he even ven-
tured the statement that hermon was in
the habit of drinking alone-a statement
borne out by the fact that only one glass
was found beside the body you see i
had removed the other mary hermon
was not going to suffer any more if i
could prevent it

 longing

by david cory

 rjphe road that leads to yesterday
 i would not tread again-

 the roses all they had their thorns

 and ecstasy its pain

 i would not cross the well-worn bridge
 that spanned the silver stream

 nor watch the pallid crescent moon
 within its waters gleam

 i would not hear the vesper bells
 proclaim the hour for prayer

 nor smell the lilacs fragrant breath
 upon the evening air

 i	could not wait to hear the gate
 click down the dusky lane-

 but i would die to feel your lips
 upon my mouth again

his pipe and stretched out his long legs

  my dear chap dont you know that
these extraneous young women have no
earthly interest for me one of these
days i may with luck introduce you
suddenly to the one girl of all this earth
who is going to be my wife and then
youll be able to talk about angels with
a bit more knowledge than you do at
present theres the bugle lets feed

  the brothers so utterly dissimilar in
appearance so closely and delightfully
united in sympathy went arm in arm
down the companionway past the or-
chestra which had begun to play a dull
selection of old english airs and found
themselves rubbing shoulders with the
usual hungry heterogeneous crowd at
the chief stewards table the london
officials of the steamship company had
notified the lurania that mr rowan
tracy m p was to receive special at-
tention and a seat at the captains table
the steward had made it so the two
brothers were conducted through a maze
of tables to the place of honor they
were alone there

  the little old captain said harry
consulting the elaborate menu with the
eye of a specialist wont be down to-
day tricky job getting away from the
coast

  rowan smiled indulgently at his
brothers elderly seafaring nonchalance
and rose suddenly to his feet he twist-
ed round die chair next his own and to
harrys combined amusement and cha-
grin bowed with more than a touch of
politeness to a girl who had been shown
to the table by a steward


the risk

  it was the angel

  her eyes w-ere bluer and her hair more
golden than harry had been able to con-
vey in his boyish colloquial outburst
from a quick glance the elder brother
saw behind the exquisite youth and the
quiet shy dignityof this quite unusual
girl something that made him feel queer-
ly and unexplainably interested it
struck him that round the delicate cor-
ners of her mouth there was an expres-
sion of rather pathetic dependence
something which showed that young as
she was she had already tasted some of
the sadness of life among the smartly
dressed women in the saloon her slight
exquisite figure in its simple black frock
stood out like a little sigh among loud
laughter

  for the first time in his busy life
rowan tracy felt self-conscious awk-
ward he passed her the menu silently
and when she said thank you her
voice thrilled him he caught his
brothers reproachful eyes and met them
steadily he seemed to say you and
your little promise be damned my
friend by the grace of god i have
met my woman and i know it laugh
if you like you are young and it is the
privilege of the young to forget easily
if ever this girl goes out of my life
again it will not be because i have
lacked the courage to claim her

  young mrs kavanagh was one of
those merry little souls with poisonous
tongues who invariably on board ship
collcct round them most of the young
men under twenty-two and several over
sixty like her numerous sisters of the
same breed she was helpless and re-
quired wrapping up and unwrapping
and some one always had to bring her
broth at eleven-oclock and tea or choco-
late at four also like her sisters her
ankles were neat and out of the kind-
ness of her heart she shared the fact
with others on the fifth day out she

was lying in her deck-chair on the
sunny side of the deck and to give her
atmosphere and the impression of what
she euphoniously called cul-ture-she
had been one of the belles of chicago-
she was carrying a little library com-
posed of hewlett shaw ibsen and
nietzsche not one of which could she
read to save her life

  rowan tracy walked by his hand
was holding the arm of leila brandon-
the angel if any of his fellow-mem-
bers of the house of parliament had
seen him at that moment they would
have been obliged to stare into his fae
to recognize their rather stern friend
he looked ten years younger and like a
man who had found the eldorado of his
dreams

  the man in the striped white flannel
trousers who characteristically forgot
to hold his stomach in his chest looked
after them with what is called and hid-
eously called the knowing smile

  quick work he said i wonder
what effect an american wife will have
upon english politics

  the pear-shaped man whose chin
broke like waves into his collar guf-
fawed

  if a man married every girl whose
arm he held on board ship he said
most of us would have harems ive
crossed fifty-nine times ha ha

  then mrs kavanagh with the sweet-
est of smiles marry do english
members of parliament marry those
things 

  those things the boy who was
sitting at her feet looked up the
words had brought a flush to his face
ive asked miss brandon to meet my
sister i think shes a ripping girl he
said deliberately

 the little woman from chicago
shrugged her shoulders

  the longer i live she said the
more painfully obvious it becomes that
if a woman wishes to be interesting to
men she must not be good this miss

brandon of yours boy dear is not only
looked upon as a madonna by most of
you men but she has absolutely captured
our mr tracy the star turn do any
of you happen to know-please bear in
mind that im no scandalmonger-that
the fair leila brandon is at this moment
keeping house for a neighbor of mine
the notoriously unfastidious mr max-
well mcdonough

  oh no cried the boy

  oh yes said the little woman rev-
eling in the effects of her bomb and
if you dont believe me go and look in
the stateroom next to hers everybody
in chicago has been talking about their
liaison for months they say that mc-
donough who is a patron of the drama
found her in a stock company and made
hr for the moment the leading lady
of his heart and home

  disentangling herself from the close
folds of her steamer-rug so expertly as
to display an expensively embroidered
pair of stockings mrs kavanagh looked
round at the faces of her audience and
gave a hard little laugh

  of course ive scandalized you good
people she said and doubtless you are
calling me a cat but i consider it to be
the duty of a good woman to warn her
friends against the vultures of society

  some one who had apparently been
sleeping in a deck-chair within range of
the womans staccato voice rose abruptly
and cast at her a look so full of disgust
and nausea that a rush of blood dulled
for a moment the rouge upon her cheeks
as he strode off with square uncom-
promising shoulders the boy who still
sat though uncomfortably at mrs kav-
anaghs fet recognized harry tracy
and gave a little whistle through his
lips

  rowan tracy still held her arm
they were leaning on the rail above
the steerage-deck beneath them
sprawled the ungainly untidy flotsam
and jetsam of european civilization who

expected to find the streets of america
paved with gold

  tracy s usually sympathetic eyes were
concentrated upon the wistful flower-
face of the girl who unconsciously
nestled against his shoulder the poor
devils beneath him whose disillusionment
hourly was growing nearer might have
been miles away

  where are you going she asked

  canada he said will you come

  a startled disappointed look came
into the girls eyes

  what do you mean she said was
he too then like all the others

  ive been looking for you always
looking and looking and all the while
ive been saving up for you saving
everything for you-soul and body and
heart do you think you could find
enough in me to give me all i need in re-
turn by all i mean your soul and body
and heart will you marry me and
walk through the rest of my life so close-
ly by my side that we shall be able to
hear each others heart beat 

  a sort of trembling seized the girl
she stood inarticulate but her eyes were
filled with a rush of things-thankful-
ness gratitude joy and oddly enough
surprise

  and then he said cant you find
anything to say

  she put up her face it was the ac-
tion of a child she seemed to be alone
with this man in a world which up to
that moment had been peopled with
enemies and ugly with sin

  with a sort of inward cry he took
her lips and so opened the floodgates of
her heart

  thank god for you she said
thank god id given you up ages
ago and when i came on board this
ship i prayed that i might have the
strength to choose a dark night and a
quiet hour and slip down into a deep
peaceful grave life has been almost
too much for me i was at the end of
my tether your great strong arm held


the risk

me back i have belonged to you soul
and body and heart not for live days-
these blessed five days-but always so
that i seem to have forgotten everything
that has gone before

  darling darling he said forget
everything except that i love you v hen
can you marry me

  she clutched his arm desperately
soon oh soon she cried if you
love me well enough never to remember
-never to think of me except as you
have known me-marry me at once
take me from this ship and never let me
out of your sight again i love you i
love you you shall never regret it i
swear that i will serve you and walk at
your side you shall shape me-make
me anything you like tell me youre
not afraid of the risk

  the girl spoke as though she were
pleading for her life

  tracy took hei in his arms and kissed
her mouth what did he care who saw
he had found his mate

  risk there is no risk i love you
you as i know you you as you are
tracy turned as he felt a sharp warn-
ing hand upon his arm and met the eyes
of his brother in them was a look that
he had never seen before

  what are you doing harrys
voice was harsh

  beginning to live said tracy tri-
umphantly leila is going to marry
me

ill

  leila held out her hand to harry
she liked this boy his frank clean ad-
miration was very refreshing very good
it was also very different from the sort
of admiration to which she had been
subjected to her astonishment and
consternation her hand was ignored
what poison had this boy been injected
with or worse still had he heard the
truth in her case the deadliest of all
poisons happiness is like the statue
of isis whose veil no mortal ever raised

  can i speak to you alone rowan
said harry its very urgent

  of course my dear fellow whats
your trouble

  he took leila put her into her deck-
chair made her comfortable kissed her
lips whispered an excuse and ran his
arm through his brothers

  your cabin said tne boy grimly
neither of them was aware that they
were followed by leila brandon who
with a fatalistic dread of impending evil
stood outside the window of the state-
room listening

  rowan loaded his pipe and as he did
so he hummed the finale of the last act
of faust

  harry had never been known to beat
about the bush now facing his brother
he came to the point at once

  i wish to god ro something had hap-
pened to prevent your sailing  he be-
gan abruptly and paused at the stare
with which his exclamation was re-
ceived

 do you i dont what do you
mean  rowan put the question quick-
ly already a nameless dread was form-
ing in his mind

  what  say im awfully sorry old
man you and i are pals as well as
brothers id rather break my arm tlian
hurt you but its got to be done and
its up to me to do it

  the unusual emotion in the boys
voice made rowan look sharply at him

  hurt me he said how i dont
know anything that could hurt me now
well old man its about the girl-
miss brandon i heard things and re-
fused to believe them when i saw that
you were really hard hit i watched and
listened to-day i went a step further
i made inquiries you must chuck her
at once without any bones at all

  ill see you damned first and
further than that ill trouble you to
leave miss brandons name out of this
discussion

  harry stiffened he had never been
cosmo hamilton



spoken to in this way by his brother
but for the great love that existed be-
tween them and his desire to prevent
rowans life from being as he thought
utterly ruined he would have let things
slide as it was he persisted with all
the pluck for which he was famous at
his college

  the worst of it is he said miss
brandons name isnt the only one that
must come into this discussion its
bracketed with that of a low brute called
maxwell mcdonough a notorious wom-
an-hunter-the blatant cad whom i have
heard bragging in the smoking-room
about his successes in fact the man
we thought at first was leila brandons
father and who has kept to his cabin
half drunk all the trip is the man who
is keeping her

  rowan got up slowly his fist was
clenched and his lips were set

  no cried harry before you hit
me youve got to listen im not telling
you the gossip of the ship im talking
facts ive had the whole story verified
by the purser if you dont believe me
go and find out for yourself good god
man think of you you with all you mean
to the country and all you have to do
for the country taking back a wife who
has been the plaything of any man who
could pay enough its unthinkable

  rowans arm was held back by a slim
white hand and leila brandon stood
between the two brothers

  dont strike him she said quietly
what he says is true

  i dont believe it ill never believe
it tracys voice shook

  you must believe it you said you
loved me and you asked me to be your
wife i love you i have never loved
any one else never i swear it i was
afraid to run the risk of losing you by
telling you what every one else seems
to know now you shall have the truth
and then do anything you like with me
make me your mistress or throw me
aside

  the two brothers watched the pale
girl as she stood up before them to be
judged there was a terrible simplicity
ghastly dignity in every line of her
slight young figure she stood with her
hands clasped like a little girl who had
to confess some misdemeanor to her
guardians the elder brothers face was
drawn and white and there was nothing
of triumph on the face of the younger
one the regular pulse of the ship went
on steadily and the sun flooded the little
stateroom and made it seem sarcastic-
ally cheerful the steady pendulum
swing of the clean towels on the rack
emphasized the rigid self-control of the
three people whose nerves were at break-
ing-point

  when i was sixteen my father died
the girls voice came in a sort of reci-
tative his love was the only thing
that made my childhood happy for
years after he died my home was un-
bearable and i longed to get away my
mother was a cold unresponsive woman
and all the love she had was given to
my sister who loathed the sight of me
because i was pretty and she wrasnt
i was superfluous unneeded i was a
constant source of irritation to them
both nothing that i did was right
every little action was criticised

  i was watched and suspected because
i was young and full of the joy of life
there wasnt much joy in life in our
little hide-bound town  was horribly
dissatisfied and lonely the four walls
of what wasnt a home to me became
every day more and more like the bars of
a cage the only time i was happy was
when i was reading stories of love and
excitement by the light of one flickering
candle at night in my bedroom and even
this harmless as it now seems was stop-
ped by hetty who said i was steeping
my mind in false and harmful things i
cant begin to tell you how this sister
hurt me and warped my nature and
drove me to make plans for an escape
anything even work in a store seemed


the risk

better more full of promise than the
same deadly monotonous round of small
duties and hideous quarrels that seemed
to chip little pieces off ny soul   
one dull wet morning i put my few
small treasures in a cheap suit-casc and
sneaked away like a whipped dog with
a draggled feather in my hat and tne
mud of the town i hoped i should never
sec again on my skirt i bought a ticket
for boston tucked away in my purse
i had a small advertisement of a well-
known clothing-house requiring young
girls as cloak-models i checked my
suit-case at the big strange station and
asked my way eagerly to the store which
was to make me independent of my sis-
ters tyranny i wited timidly among
almost a hundred other girls until my
turn came for examination examina-
tion-think of it by a little dirty man
with trespassing fingers uh  i turned
out to be a perfect thirty-six but that
was not enough to get me the job there
was something ese required but even
the thought of going back to laneville
was not enough to drive me to that i
hurried out of the store into the air i
suppose i was crying-disillusionment
had come so soon i was just going
back to the station when one of my
would-be fellow-models touched me on
the arm she was not a perfect thirty-
six and as a last resource was going to
apply to the manager of a no  musical
comedy company tor chorus work   
we toured three-night stands and
smalls until the company was stranded
near chicago with the few dollars we
had saved we went to that bleak city
am there we remained hungry and idle
until a fairv-prince-thats what my little
friend daiy called him-put us both
irno a stock company which he had or-
ganized he did not want gratitude
he wanted me i refused to give him
what he wanted even after i was told

that my services were no longer re-
quired but hunger and loneliness have
been responsible for many of the poor
women who come out after dark with
the bats    he has been very kind to
me in his own coarse way but he took
good care that i should never escape
he heaped flashy things upon me hut
he never gave me money in the few
hours that he left me alone how often
i wished that i might have been con-
tented with dull monotony and daily
duty and an honest bed i dared jnbt
look forward i was even afrafbf 
looking beyond my waking hours hut
do you suppose either of you that in
the prayers i cried out at night i didnt
beg that some day soon-and it worifd
have to be soon-i might meet a tvisui
who would understand and forgive be-
cause he understood and would lift me
up again out of this gutter    vo t
came and i thought that you were the-
man was i wrong have i expected
the impossible tell me is the risk too
great 

  her voice broke but she maintained a
curious dignity that is only acquired by
those who have served a hard apprenii
ship to life

  without any hesitation rowan tr-cy
took her in his arms

  i have been working theoretically for
many years he said give me the
chance of doing something practical
make a man of me let me wipe out
the memory of all these hideous things
you and i began our lives on the
lvrania nothing but death shall sep-
arate us now i love you

  with a look of awe and complete sym-
pathy harry slipped quietly out as
lie closed the door softly behind him a
little glad cry rang through the cabin
went up like a dove to heaven and set-
tled on the soft shoulder of the ma-
donna mother of women
fire of the snow

by evelyn campbell

in the north where the long winter
holds the sun in leash until the
pulse of spring thrills through its
reluctant veins and the belated summer
breaks forth to burn and die in the grasp
of the pursuing frost passion comes
swiftly to life in the hearts of men and
maids and full bom demands its fru-
ition the stars are very close to the
everlasting snow up there

  such a love brought big jean and
beautiful blanche-marie trembling with
the newness of their emotions before
the parish priest almost before romance
had time to lift its shy head

  there were those who looked dubi-
ously at the bridegroom and thought of
the hearts that had lain at the brides
feet to be played with for a little while
and forgotten then looking once
more and seeing the great graceful
length of the man his face which had
the clear-cut lines of the indian with
the soft dark eyes of the provencal and
knowing that among the men of the vil-
lage he had always been a leader they
doubted no longer here was one in-
deed to hold the fancy of a flighty maid

  yet before the wedding-ring had
grown cold upon her finger there was
blanche-marie upon the doorsteps of her
friend melanie with sighs and com-
plaints upon her lips life it seemed
had grown dull already in the cabin
where big jeans mother had been
happy asking nothing but a full trap
and a hot fire for her man at the end of
the day and enough clear spring water
and white sand to keep shining her cop-
per vessels brought from france and
to such a fate was to be condemned

blanche-marie who since she could
walk had chased the butterflies of life
melanie who had been one of the most
dubious of the wedding guests gave
comfort with admonition

  but it is that you are wedded now
ma cherie she said to stand about
the fountain or to dally at the traders
would be unseemly in madame laroux
although i admit it was but amusing in
blanche-marie there are the coppers
and the bead-work

  it is the coppers that i hate flashed
blanche-marie and the bead-work
i have no indian blood

  these were words leveled directly at
jean laroux though he was never to
hear them blanche-marie was a bit of
parisian pavement transplanted heaven
knows how or why to this eagles nest
amidst the snows her beauty was of
the kind before which men are as help-
less as leaves before the wind she
charmed without effort because she was
created for charm and hearts that
thrilled once never ceased to quicken for
her

  and he say before marriage she
went on sullenly that i upon the ped-
estal should sit while he worshiped-
so j

  and is that fitting questioned me-
lanie scandalized that you should be
so reverenced ijclas what would you
a man courts that he may marry he
weds that he may have one to cook his
dinner

and he upbraid me finished blanche-
marie with the sullenness of a spoiled
child if even one little bean he bum
the new-born summer was glowing


fire of the snow

like the heart of a rose when red angus
mackenzie came over the long trail with
his wiry little horses and rough cart to
buy supplies at the traders he had
stood about for two or three days in his
silent way taking no part in the village
life when blancbe-marie saw him urst
the other men whom she had known all
her life were for passing cm with quick
salutations when they encountered her
they were of no mind for the batten
of her dark eyes when big jean was
there for a background so in the stranger
she saw the possibility of a fleeting
amusement for she was sadly distrait
even before three months of wedded life

   she sighed prodigiously drawing her
water at the common well when he stood
within earshot and was rewarded when
he took the rope from her hand and
with a twist of the wrist filled her jug
to overflowing she looked from under
her silky lashes a look that had never
falei its mark but the strangers eyes
met her ow n cdid and unmove l

         murmured blanche-marie as-
tonished is it that the man is the
devii such eyes such a redness 

  for angus mackenzie was of a dif-
ferent race and a different blood he
was a red scot his cheeks were criss-
crossed with tiny veins painted there by
the icy fingers of the frosi and his beard
hung across his breast like a flame to
blanche-marie wearied of her dark-
skinned countryman and the colorless
snows le was like a sun-god

  it was in keeping with his taciturn
nature that he made no inquiries nor
tried to seek her out he was of those
men for whom woman is a closed book
to be opened by one hand alone still
unknown to her his eyes followed her
uht  her scarlet skin and sri--g black
heai disappeared in her ov n doorway

   at their next meeting elanche-marie
piqued gave him a tantalizing smile to
match the invitation in her eyes and this
time he responded by walking a little
way at her side in her naive delight

  at once more having a cavalier she
brought forth all her pretty ways

  it is not to be supposed that such a
slackening of the reins of convention-
ality could be overlooked jn a settlement
where rigid virtue is the watchword of
every door blanche-marie at once felt
the chill winds of disapproval blow
across her path but what cared she so
long as jean took his hsh-lines and went
his way every morning to return at mht
far too sleep-drugged to listen to heed-
less gossip a girl was not a vegetable

  but at last there came a night when
the soup was as water the fish burred
in the pan and the beans of the sals of
brine big jean who v as weary cursed
because blanche-marie was a small
thing ami cowered be fore j im be ud
not strike her but for the first me he
went away and left her in the ca u widi
the lonely night

  and red angus traveled north at
moon rise site knew because they had
spoken together that day swiftly s e
threw the red shawl about her bum g
face and looking with fun- at the lit-
tered table and the smoking lamp went
forth to find him

  he was at the stable where his little
horses were shdtered fastening the -ast
buckles on the harness and tying the
last rope all at once she knew tltat she
loved him and be was going slc was
weeping in his arms iier tear-wet fae
raised to his and his arm were like
cold steel that would never unlock and
his breast like an iron shield strong to
defend with the first kiss he claimed
her

  you are mine he said savagely

	 ine you go north with me to-
night r

  yes yes cried blanche-marie hur-
riedly i could never leave you now
i pray the good god ihtrre are no copper
kettles there in the north

  not understanding bat with quick
hands he made place for her in the cart
among the ioxes and bags and fearing
evelyn campbell



no man drove boldly forth from the vil-
lage

  their departure was not unnoticed
some one ran to the inn where big
jean drinking smoky scotch with old
cronies received the news with oaths
that came from the unfed depths of his
great frame

  but he has-what you say-picked
a lemon he said for me i will
choose again and this time by gar a
woman who can make pot-au-feu

  so that there was no pursuit and sun-
up found red angus and his pack-
train well on their way

  when he looked at blanche-marie he
found her asleep with her smooth
flushed cheek against a rough sack and
her hands curled like little leaves she
looked like a fair child it was hard to
believe that she was a woman who had
made her second choice a terrible ten-
derness rose in his heart a swelling that
threatened to burst his iron breast she
was so little so weak

  the love between them was a wonder-
ful thing as were the days that wound
through forests and wide ways and the
nights under the stars blanche-marie
never asked where they were going-
there was too much love in the day too
much sunshine and gay laughter and at
night too much weariness

  but at last the journey came to an end
the cabin awaited them a shack built
by a lonely man for his own occupancy
crouched between two great firs the
tallest for many miles around blanche-
marie said nothing she remembered the
embroidery frame and the coppers and
looked anxiously around as she entered

  but in angus mackenzies cabin there
was no sign of another womans afflu-
ence or industry everything was of the
plainest and most primitive-a mans
world blanche-marie sighed with re-
lief even as her lover who had allowed
her to touch her hand to no task made
her comfortable with the best the place
afforded

  she had learned that he was a pros-
pector there was a claim in the val-
ley that promised riches he sat at her
feet in the moonlight and opened his
heart to her in the way of silent men
by and by they would go down to the
states-there was much to be had there
-and after that europe london paris
blanche-marie clapped her hands at that
but when he spoke in a different tone
of the scotch highlands she looked
blank and shivered

  i know nothing of it she said plain-
tively why should we leave paris if
we are happy there

  when they had lived in the cabin be-
tween the two firs for ten fairy days
he told her one morning that he must
go on a long journey to the next nearest
trading - post - blanche-maries village
being the nearest there was clothing
to buy for her and comforts for the
cabin which his eyes grown tender in
her service could see were lacking it
was too far and too rough a way for her
to travel even the cart must be left be-
hind

  she consented without demur the
time had been when she would have
shrieked with terror at thought of the
loneliness and of the dogs half wolf
that lay about the door now she even
caressed an ear of picard the leader
who stood near the love that wrapped
her about was shield enough for any
danger and the adoration in her lovers
eyes dwarfed the light of any other
glance but still she wept when he start-
ed and hung about his neck

  is it that you would leave me here
to die she sobbed well then go
it will not be long

  red angus who knew nothing of
womens vagaries and who was near to
weeping himself comforted her

  i go only to buy you pretty things
he laughed my sweetheart cannot do
with one gown she shall have the best
that can be found and a chain for her
neck too


fire of the snow

  he was away for weeks one of the
horses went lame and there were vari-
ous other mishaps but when he returned
there were bundles piled high upon each
ponys back and the bag of gold-dust
lie had carried with him lay in the trad-
ers strong-box

  blanche-marie sat in the doorway
her unbound hair lay in blue-black
masses over her shoulders some of it
even trailed upon the doorstep where
she sat she took no notice of his com-
ing because her face was buried in her
hands and she was weeping not tem-
pestuously as was her way but with
long hard sobs that shook her frail body

  red angus swept her into his arms

  i am here sweetheart he cried his
own voice trembling

  but she drawing back betrayed a face
so changed so pale and sad that his
emotion was altered to amazement it
was as though the golden light of a win-
dow had suddenly been extinguished by
a black north wind

  what is it he cried fearfully tell
me girl has harm come to you 

  she echoed his words drearily harm
yes the worst then seeing how
stunned he was she went on not to
me alone to all of us

  you must tell me he said speaking
in a tone strange to her

  and blanche-marie whispered fear-
fully there is to be a child

  still he did not comprehend a
child that is no great matter-no
cause for weeping at least

  his child she whispered again

  his face changed at that she did
not see because her own was hidden
and she was weeping again this time
against the doorpost there was a
silence

  what of it cried red angus at
last it is your child and it shall be
mine

  but the days passed into weeks and
the weeks into months and still blanche-
marie wept

  the long winter closed in upon them
there were days that were nights with
the falling snow and the two sat be-
fore their fire watching the wonderful
thing die that had been between them
for blanche-marie had grown to shud-
der at his touch and to turn her face
away

  he loved her even more there was
no more talk of paris or gay doings
there not much talk of anything she
would sit braiding her long hair or twist-
ing it into rings staring into the fire
with eyes that had grown large and
piteous he cared for her as though
she had been a child he did not mind
her petulancies or her tears save that
they saddened him there was no
longer a vestige of the playfulness of
love between them at the first repulse
he had withdrawn his heart that had lain
in her hands

  when the time arrived that he must
go again to the traders for supplies he
iiad the first hint of the cause of the
change in her he asked what present
he could bring that would please her
since most of the pretty gowns he had
bought on the last trip yet lay in their
wrappings and blanche-marie an-
swered timidly tremulously

  i-i should like a copper kettle

  but it was in the illimitable dreariness
of the late winter when the two were
housed together during endless days
that she could bear the burden of her
secret thoughts no longer or perhaps
it was that she had grown weaker

  it is the tic bet wen us him and me
she explained piteously it cannot
break the babe he calls for his father

  so red angus knew at last he pon-
dered the question long and deeply when
blanche-marie lay asleep or seeming 
sleep in the bunk with her face turned
to the wall there was reserve between
them no longer her grief broke down
all barriers day and night the plaint
from her lips was the same i want
my husband i want him
evelyn campbell



  one morning very early he wakened
her from her fitful rest fie was lean-
ing over her dressed for the open out
of doors there was the whining of the
dogs and the patter of paws

  listen blanche-marie he said
sternly because his heart was like lead
in his breast she looked at him in sud-
den fear his face was black in the smoky
light

  listen he said again i am going
away it will be days before i return
if it was later i could not leave you
but i will stop at the indian village and
send a woman to you do you under-
stand you are safe there is plenty
of wood and food you can care for
yourself for a little while

  she asked no questions but lay inert
upon her bed he bent over her again

  will you kiss me blanche-marie

  but she threw her arm across her face
with a cry and when she looked again
he was gone she could hear his voice
calling to the dogs as they started with
a burst of speed upon the long trail

  the sky lay like a snow-smothered
blanket against the gray frozen earth
the dogs strong from rest and much
fat caribou bounded blithely forward
making good headway even over the
unbroken trail red angus ran with the
team partly to keep his blood from
freezing and partly to numb the pain
that surged in his breast there would
be more snow it was in the air when
he made camp that night it was in a
blinding white world

  but to him the white smother pre-
sented no difficulty that he could not
overcome there was that within him
which defied the storm and danger urg-
ing the struggling team on he never
waited for the blizzard to cease or even
abate but hardly giving the tired beasts
time for food and the necessary rest he
pressed on his way and on the seventh
day he came in sight of the village which
he had last seen on the night that he had
taken blanche-marie from her home

  had the spirit of some well-laid dead
risen to defy them the loungers in the
traders store could not have been more
astounded than at the apparition of red
angus black and swollen face among
them with one accord they drew apart
and left him to face big jean who leaned
against a counter his face swollen also
though not with the frost among the
people of the village there had been a
murmuring when jean laroux had al-
lowed another to steal his wife away and
had raised no hand to reclaim her or to
avenge himself there is always the
grudging respect for bravery in mens
hearts and angus mackenzie by com-
ing alone among them claimed what the
other had forfeited

  but there are other ways than in loud
talk and acts of vengeance that a man
may seek reparation big jean whom
no one understood faced the man who
had despoiled him and they who saw
his face shivered and drew back-all but
red angus

  i have come for you he said look-
ing the other straight in the face we
start at once

  big jean laughed a terrible thing to
hear

  you wish me to witness your happi-
ness-so he mocked or is it that
madame grows lonely among the
snows 

  do not call her name warned
mackenzie steadily there is no time
to waste i will explain-he looked
around at the circle of faces-but not
here

  he walked to the door and jean la-
roux involuntarily followed but reach-
ing there he stopped and the curses in
his throat strangled him

  she wants to come back blood of
my fathers i would not take her back
if she came crawling on her knees the
insolence 

  they were outside upon the hard-
trampled snow that was as smooth as an
arena some of the onlookers had fol-


fire of the snow

lowed them others crowded in the open
door red angus stepped close to the
other mans side

  she will never come back    hut
she wants you a child is coming   
your child

  god of my fathers laroux stag-
gered then cried furiously you
would foist this upon me go back-
go back to that creature who sent you

  she did not send me said mac-
kenzie calmly as before her eyes alone
asked her lips seldom spoke but she
is sick and she wants you you must
come

  and then suddenly they were fighting
a ring of rough excited faces were
around them the dogs too-old picard
with a buried snarl in his throat big
tean in his wolfskin parka a huge al-
most grotesque figure dwarfed the
shorter man who wore close mackinaws
and seemed slender in comparison but
in a moment it wras to be seen that the
men were evenly matched it was like
a battle of the caribous there was the
straining of great muscles the breath-
ing from bursting lungs and then the
blood it splashed the faces of both
and froze as it burst from the bruised
skin there was a hoarse cry from big
jean a glittering knife flew from his
hand and landed a dozen feet away in a
mound of snow where it buried itself
to the hilt and remained the handle erect
as though it might have been slicing a
huge wedding-cake

  now will you come said angus
mackenzie bending his enemy backward
until the bones in his spine cracked it
was over the sledge waited and with
the half-dead body of laroux bundled
upon it mackenzie mushed out of the
village as unafraid as when he had en-
tered it but the dogs grumbled among
themselves they had sensed the warm
litter and the meat and the village dogs
who cowered away before them

  if at the beginning of the journey the
cold had bit into the vitals of mackenzie

and his team on the way back it took
their bodies into its terrible hands and
searched cruelly for the hearts that kept
them quick

  and there was the added weight of
big jean who lay half stupefied unable
to walk from the pain that remained
from the pressure of the knee in his
back on account of this he rode until
it was seen that the dogs had much to
do to keep the sledge moving their
feet were bleeding their hearts break-
ing then he rose and staggered behind
while red angus slow to fatigue trotted
ever ahead to break trail for the strain-
ing dogs

  days and nights merged into each
other unnoticed there was no rest but
what must be taken from exhaustion
the team none too well matched at the
start began to give up finally to die
one by one they were left along the
trail small sacrifices instantly to be
buried beneath the wall of snow that
ever drifted before the undying wind

  at length there was left only old
picard the savage whose ears blanche-
marie had often caressed when that
happened the two who hated each other
so fiercely were forced into speech

  you shall hear why i came for you
said red angus behind the wind-shield
where the three lay together gnawing
frozen meat it is because at such a
time a woman must have her way the
time is near when it is over she shall
take her choice i have heard that they
wish for things that are contrary to all
reason therefore if she wishes for you
after what has happened she shall have
you until her mind is clear again

  she asked for me mumbled big
jean in his throat

  she asked for  a copper kettle
said red angus simply

  after awhile there was a great sob
from the breast of laroux picard
startled looked around with red snow-
blinded eyes

  the three were harnessed to the
evelyn campbell



sledge red angus in front soon they
must take tlie meager packs upon their
backs but before this was done big
jean hesitated and crumpled down in the
snow his feet were frozen

  there was a long delay while the other
man worked over him rubbing his limbs
with snow beating him back to life
when they could go on again there was
only one man to bear the burden the
strength of laroux was as water

  we must not die red angus would
say a hundred times a day her time
is near

  and in the terrible days of torture
and in the nights as terrible there was
no sound but that of big jeans sobs

  an hour came at last when they knew
for the first time in many weary hours
the difference between day and night
so long they had struggled in the gray
semi-darkness of the blizzard that when
the miracle came upon them they were
dazzled by its wonder the pall of gray
was suddenly pierced by a gleam of
soft brilliancy that bathed the desolate
world in a flood of color the northern
sun was setting there was nothing to
be seen but its red-gold glory and the
immeasurable spaces snow-covered
what had been a world of despair be-
came a place of beauty what was
almost peace came into the hearts of the
two who knew such bitterness

  between the snow-bowed firs the cabin
lay buried to its chimney in the
smother who could see whether there
were smoke or not the firs bent sadly
down

  a path was made some way to the
door old picard who had made no
lament when he left his wife and
sons scattered along the trail for
crows to feed upon next spring sat
upon his haunches and howled short
wolf-howls to the sky   

  when the door lay open before them
they saw at first nothing but the gleam
of the meager fire and crouching be-
fore it the old indian woman who

turned an ancient face of aloof disdain
towards their entrance

  mackenzie who led the way called
through cracked lips i have come
girl and i have brought himbut there
was no answer save the sounds that had
been with them before

  marie mon enfant cried big jean
broken

  there was a signal of life from the
bunk beyond the hearth blanche-
marie lay there veiled in her long black
hair and the two who loved her could
look at nothing but her eyes which were
filled with an indescribable light the soft
brilliance of a hundred candles burned
before a sacred altar

  she lifted a transparent arm in a glad
gesture of welcome

  ah look she cried in a thread-like
voice you must behold her jean the
little one i am so happy that you are
here to see her

  in some way-for his feet were help-
less things-laroux dragged himself
nearer from the foot of the bunk he
looked upon her with incredulous eyes
and she unconscious of his emotions
moved the heavy blanket with proud
feeble hands

  you do not look she accused with
childish petulance and i have waited
for you so long  

  the ancient indian woman stirred the
fire which sent forth but a feeble flane
for there was little fuel her face was
like a seamed and withered mask con-
cealing the wisdom of all the centuries
and though her bent shoulders refused
with scornful negation a share of the
alien white mans burden it is certain
that she heard and understood all that
passed

  blanche-marie raised the infant that
lay against her breast in slender trem-
bling arms she spoke to jean her hus-
band in poignant renunciation 

  it is for you it is all i have to give
-my child ours ah take her

a look before leaping

          by roger hartman

t teres a rather good bit-figure
stuff for a change

         morgan leonard set the can-
vas on his easel with an air of indiffer-
ence which failed to cloak the pride he
obviously felt in the painting to affect
to take his work lightly was a favorite
pose with him and accounted perhaps
for the number of his friends who were
willing to serve as spectators at im-
promptu exhibitions in his studio
they never felt it necessary to manifest
the awed enthusiasm with which a ma-
jority of wealthy amateurs expect their
performances to be greeted with
leonard setting the example of half-
disdainful tolerance it was more than
enough to favor the painting with a
brief glance and grunt a patronizing
pretty good old chap one did not
have to listen to leonard describing the
good points of each picture in puzzlingly
technical terms one did not need to pre-
tend to understand what he meant by
depth accompanied always in ama-
teur circles by a circular swipe along an
imaginary canvas with an out-turned
thumb or by atmosphere illustrated
with a wave of both hands or by any
number of other temperamental words
and gestures morgan leonard might
dabble with colors and brushes and pal-
ette-knives like any poor skate who had
to do it to live but he did not let it
monopolize his time or his conversation
he still loafed about his clubs and played
a good hand at auction or poker he
could be enlisted readily in projects for
motor-trips or discreet dinner-parties
he might have artistic tendencies but he
was nevertheless a regular fellow and

as such found his friends tolerant of his
weakness for daubing himself up like a
house-painter in his moments of leisure
from the important business of killing
time

  moreover morgan leonard had
found his puttering with paint a potent
factor in making the acquaintance of a
number of well-favored young women
who without being too obviously com-
plaisant to attract a gentleman of so-
phisticated tastes were on the other
hand not too tiresomely prim to prove
entertaining his models more than
justified his hobby to those of his friends
who were on terms of sufficient intimacy
with him to share in his pleasant little
studio parties it wasnt hard to put up
with an occasional exhibit of morgans
beloved daubs in return for participa-
tion in those informally delightful af-
fairs and the models thanks to a cer-
tain discrimination on leonards part
were truly above the average in looks
conversation tastes and-let us say dis-
cretion for a young gentleman of
abundant finances and invisible occupa-
tions who has long since exhausted the
amusement possibilities of the stage-
doors it is undeniably refreshing to gain
entree to that twilight zone where art
rubs elbows with the philistine and
morals and proprieties and conventions
begin to merge into the easy code of
near-bohemia morgan was deservedly
popular with his friends and his studio
w-as a haven of blessed refuge for a
choice fewr of them

  livingston schuyler van duyck gaz-
ing at morgans latest masterpieces
through the blue haze of cigarette-smoke


a look before leaping

was however beginning to be bored
l ld morgan had begun to display signs
of straying after strange gods of art
and a series of cubic portrayals of car-
rots cab-drivers and corkscrews all
looking very much alike to mr  an
duycks untutoredeye had led that art-
critic to wonder whether after all mor-
gan might not be a person to avoid in
the future he rubbed his chin reflect-
ively as he stared at a chaotic depiction
of what leonard assured him had been
in life a loaf of bread and meditated
vaguely upon an excuse for canceling
that tentative engagement for dinner at
the club he was disappointed in mor-
gan but at the words figure stuff he
brightened perceptibly he had been
sufficiently initiated into the parlance of
the craft to understand that this phrase
meant something more interesting than
futuristic carrots in lemon and aquama-
rine he leaned forward as the figure
stuff slid on the easel then his some-
what pudgy figure straightened and
grew rigid with attention his rather
weak mouth opened to vacuity his
round pale eyes glittered and widened

  gad old top but thats ripping i
say posifizrlyi thats what i call
top-hole really

  leonard dissembled his gratification
at this obviously sincere tribute

  oh its all right in its way of
course but its nothing but photogra-
phy i only painted the model-a cam-
era would have done it just as well

  its great asserted mr van duyck
admiringly how you do it i cant see
its a gift thats what old top a gift
-what 

  h i dont know its plugging
away does most of it if i had time to
go into the thing seriously i might do
something worth while of course
but-

    i tell you its a gift now i never
could pick em out like that  i see pic-
tures of peaches like that in the papers
and i read about em in books but i

never run across em anywhere in the
flesh but you could shut your eyes and
walk a block in hoboken by gad and
come back with a queen a dream its
a gift morgie old scout-positively
and mr van duyck resumed his rever-
ent inspection of the figure stuff quite
unconscious that he had grievously
wounded his friends self-esteem no
artist-not even an excruciatingly weal-
thy young man who confines his artis-
try to tuesdays and fridays-likes to
discover that a tribute to his talent is
meant to refer to his ability at discover-
ing charming young women not averse
to posing in what is flippantly but vivid-
ly described as the altogether

  oh the model morgies voice was
pained yes shes a looker but i cant
give her much outside of that new one
-wandered in the other day and i saw
her possibilities just like that funny
how a fellows eye gets trained so as to
spot a good model in the first sec isnt
it 

  shes a dream-positively mur-
mured the rapt and inattentive art-critic
who is she when do i meet her

  the discouraged painter shrugged his
shoulders reflecting that after all livy
was indubitably atrophied above his
ample neck and that his judgment was
wholly negligible in matters concerning
true art he turned to a mahogany
stand and fumbled with a number of
printed cards until he found one written
in pencil

  miriam st clair he read aloud
wearily river twelve-three-four-nine
no address its up to you livy if
you want to cultivate her i cant give
her a thing except looks shes a prune
honestly

  mr van duyck busied himself with a
pocket-pad and gold-pencil grinning
sagely he was absolutely on to mor-
gies little game he didnt blame old
morgie for wanting to monopolize a
dream like this-and whatever his fail-
ings as a connoisseur of art mr van
roger hartman



duyck was undeniably versed in the ac-
curate appraisal of feminine attractions
if morgie wouldnt fix it up for him he
would play a lone hand it was better
anyway a four-cornered party was
often a nuisance to an earnest young
man two would be more workable and
less expensive

  he studied the painting anew it was
the sadly conventional figure stuff of
the amateur remarkable rather for
frankness than for any quality or orig-
inality or expression and morgie while
a fair workman was far from being a
genius of even the lowest order he
had painted the girl facing the observer
in the alluring garb of sinless eden and
paradox though the words appear the
absence of covering covered a multitude
of artistic sins to mr van duycks
approving eye the picture was a master-
piece but his tribute was for the sculp-
tress nature rather than for the por-
trayer never in his life had mr van
dtiyck been so utterly fascinated by the
feminine figure he was excusable in-
deed for the model whose form had
been photographically portrayed by
morgies brush was a poem in pink
velvety skin soft adorable curves and
jong slender lines so graceful that not
even morgies faulty technique had been
able to disguise their loveliness the
face was pretty and a little odd the
mouth perhaps a shade too firm for
beauty the lips thin and expressive of a
certain resolution the eyes just a trifle
indicative of an excessively calculating
spirit but it was a face none the less
which one would recognize easily not
distinctive in any single feature but
markedly so in the ensemble and al-
though livingston schuyler van duyck
impressed that countenance upon his
memory and amiably approved of it it
was not the face which fascinated him
but the figure-the wonderful alluring
bit of rose and ivory moulded by the
cunning hand of nature for the utter
enslavement of the manly eye he

could not tear his gaze away from it
he gloated over it until morgans pa-
tience was badly strained and when that
slightly vexed artist finally insisted upon
ending the private view took his breath
away by proposing to buy the canvas

  it was a great moment for morgan
leonard so great that he forgot and
forgave livy for his philistine comment
and figuratively fell on his neck a man
may be never so proud of his amateur
standing in outward pose but show him
a chance to secure actual coin of the
realm in exchange for his creations and
he will turn professional in the twink-
ling of a diamond shirt-stud praise is
sometimes eloquent but money contin-
ues to speak more convincingly than the
most emphatic of mere words and
morgie leonard who found it really a
trial to invest his surplus income ac-
cepted livys check for two hundred
dollars with exactly the same flutter of
excited nerves as the hungriest hobo-
hemian of greenwich village would have
taken it he had sold a picture he
was a member in good standing of the
artists union local no nought he
was a member of the guild a blood-
brother to the profession he had ar-
rived  he had no intention of surren-
dering that check in return for a mere
sheaf of paper money-not he as
long as he lived it would repose in a
frame over his dresser to greet him
each morning with the assurance that he
was an actual artist and no mere dilet-
tante he permitted livy to break their
dinner-date without a protest he
wanted to be alone to gloat over that
evidence of his professional status he
even helped livy surround the canvas
with protective wrappings and refrained
from wonder at the knowledge that mr
van duyck actually intended to bemean
himself by earning it to his rooms in
person he was uplifted above hira-
self

  and mr van duyck holding the
precious parcel tenderly on his rather


a look before leaping

plump knees was driven swiftly to his
own abode wearing a smile of deep and
complete self-satisfaction he set the
painting up on his cellaret and devoted
a blissful half-hour to the contemplation
of its glory remote from all unsympa-
thetic observation it intoxicated him
as no vintage wine had ever succeeded
in doing it made him wonderfully su-
perbly drunk with the sheer loveliness it
had caught and held in reflection from
the original masterpiece of nature
with a long rapturous sigh of content
and another of anticipation mr van
duyck drew forth his pocket-pad and
took up the receiver of his telephone

  river twelve-three-four-nine he
sighed into the unappreciative ear of the
operator and as he waited for the con-
nection his smile widened until it
seemed in danger of reaching the edges
of his countenance and falling off into
space a slightly acid voice answered
him at last

  miss st clair he asked the voice
admitted its identity this is liv-
ingston schuyler van duyck speak-
ing mr morgan leonard was good
enough to give me your name and num-
ber i wonder whether you could spare
me a few minutes this afternoon or this
evening-to discuss business of course

  why yes i think so could you
come at eight this evening the voice
was perceptibly less acid and mr van
duycks grin succeeded in reaching the
extreme limits of his plump cheeks
most assuredly he could and the ad-
dress the voice gave it with a touch
of hesitation and it followed the tele-
phone number into mr van duycks
little book he reluctantly permitted the
interview to terminate precipitation
he had long since learned was prone to
involve more vexatious delays than cau-
tion he would see her in a few hours
and then-well leave that to livingston
schuyler van duyck

  but as quite a number of our best
poets have set forth life is a tissue of

uncertainties and disappointments and
not even people of irreproachable family
are immune from this annoying feature
of existence mr van duyck arriving
at seven fifty-nine at a discouragingly
respectable-looking apartment-house in
the bourgeois district to the north of the
park was ushered into a living-room
which fairly exuded respectability it
was impossible to conceive of the occu-
pant thereof as other than a straitlaced
and illiberal-minded observer of all the
conventions and more than the ordinary
number of proprieties mr van duyck
as the reader may have gathered was
not noteworthy for clairvoyance but
even he was unable to avoid the im-
pression of uninviting virtue which
fairly oozed from the furniture of the
room in which he found himself his
heart sank several inches as its influence
pervaded his senses

  and miss st clair herself though in-
stantly recognizable as the original of
the masterpiece at present safely locked
in mr van duycks clothes-press con-
firmed at first glance the evidence of her
milieu she was as obviously respect-
able as a pair of black-silk mitts or
chin-whiskers or stewed prunes or red-
flannel underwear in her face her
eyes her voice her manner and above
all in her dress she proclaimed stern
uncompromising conscious virtue as
aggressively as a militant asserting her
undying antagonism toward dish-wash-
ing mr van duyck was not easily dis-
couraged in matters of this nature but
even his valiant spirit quailed as he faced
the object of his new-born adoration
but his resolution did not waver in the
least the sight of her the sustaining
knowledge that he actually stood in the
presence of divinity within sound of her
voice within touch of her hand only
confirmed him in his reprehensible in-
tentions

  you wished me to pose for you mr
van duyck her voice was a little
acid thought the infatuated art-connois-
roger hartman



seur but voices after all are matters of
unimportant detail to the true devotee
of beauty and the fact that she pro-
nounced his exalted patronymic pho-
netically as van doo-yuk did not afflict
him either culture is not to be ex-
pected of a woman whose form like
helens would have set nations at each
others throat

   -er-that is- he stammered re-
 gretting that he had not prepared a con-
 vincing fiction as to his errand but the
 lady did not wait for him to flounder to
 his finish

    im very particler about who i pose
  for she informed him can you give
  me refernees to prove that youre a
  proper person for a young girl to pose
  for of course i always bring my aunt
  anyway but as i said im extra par-
  ticler

    mr van duycks iron resolution wav-
  ered under this assault but the memory
  of that picture came back to him in time
  to freshen his courage his eyes wan-
  dered wistfully over the ladys unalluring
  costume apparently purchased at one of
  the mammoth emporiums which ad-
  vertise such outfits at  and refer
  to the process as wholesale murder of
  stupemkms values it was decidedly
  too large for her and its somewhat ex-
  treme cut caused it to bulge and sag in
  a number of unexpected places mr
  van duycks artistic impulses yearned
   impellingly to do away with its mon-
   strous libel upon the pure sheer beauty
   which it concealed

    i can give you any number of refer-

	ences he said smoothly the right
  reverend augustus bellflower for in-
  stance mrs g richem blazes mrs
  pinfeather and so on i can satisfy you
  in that respect you may be sure

   i suppose theyre all right said the
i lady doubtfully ill see if my aunt
 knows any of em she left the room
v lo return after a moment escorting a
 frim-visaged maiden lady of an obvious
 ifty-year vintage who surveyed the ar-

dent worshiper of beauty through steel-
rimmed spectacles with eyes which sug-
gested gimlets he squirmed under
their inspection

   he looks dissipated said the older
lady after some moments of study but
it may be only full-bloodedness i sup-
pose its all right if you think you can
trust him

  mr van duyck was gratified he
proceeded to seat himself and discussed
at some length the painting he had in
mind an instinctive caution prevented
him from revealing in the presence of
miss st clairs chaperon the fact that
he was interested exclusively in figure
stuff he was inclined to believe that
she would not approve

   when after listening to his conversa-
tion for an interminable time the older
lady departed to some inner shrine he
ventured to be more daring he sug-
gested that as future collaborators a
certain degree of acquaintance was de-
sirable and proposed that the object of
his devotion accompany him for a brief
excursion in his waiting motor

  after debating this matter at some
length miss st clair to his intense
gratification consented she donned a
hat which he found peculiarly unbecom-
ing and a pair of red-fleece-lined over-
shoes which she referred to as artics
by way of preparation for the joyous
adventure he began to wonder
whether after all he had not set him-
self a hopeless task he was already be-
ginning to plan the purchase of certain
paraphernalia of art before the ladys ar-
rival to pose instinctively aware that it
would otherwise be difficult to convince
her of his purely disinterested motives

  in the car however the beautiful
model unbent appreciably she permit-
ted him to hold her hand for several
blissful moments before she rebuked his
presumption with a stinging slap  his
wrist she allowed him to escort her to
a quiet restaurant where she partook dis-
creetly of mineral-water and a sand-
g

a look before leafing

wich she even accepted a number of
more or less daring compliments without
displeasure and when mr van duyck
left her at last in the gloom of the cor-
ridor before her apartment door she
actually suffered him to print an ardent
kiss upon her lips before with a shrill
squeak of dismay she slipped behind
the door and barred it in his face he
was on the whole well content with his
first evenings progress

  in his rooms he spent an exceedingly
pleasant half-hour of meditative reflec-
tion before the masterpiece of mr mor-
gie leonard it stimulated his imagina-
tion wonderfully he was thrilled to
think that he was actually on his way
toward a pleasurable intimacy with lhe
original of that poem of line and color
his dreams were roseate and he rose
with a strengthened purpose in pursu-
ance of which he made haste to com-
municate with miss st clair over the
telephone and secure her reluctant con-
sent to a morning drive through the
westchester hills in search of good land-
scape settings for the picture for which
he intended to pose her he wras ex-
ceedingly proud of this device-it af-
forded numberless possibilities without
the annoyance of buying easels and pal-
ettes and brushes and colors perhaps
he would be able to get along without
them altogether

  it thrilled him to discover that the
night had evidently softened the heart of
beauty toward him the smile with
which miss st clair welcomed him was
utterly free of acidity and her cheeks
were pleasantly pink he thought her
eyes strangely bright but she persist-
ently evaded his glance as though sud-
denly self-conscious under it her aunt
was mercifully in retirement

  he thrilled under the realization of
his progress as he drove north to the
open country beside him the girl
bundled in robes which concealed her
curiously unattractive raiment to some
extent was as silent as he not until

they had left the city behind them and
were speeding through the pleasantly
sheltered wood-ways of the country did
they begin to talk in earnest and then
with a note of indulgent reproof in her
tone miss st clair startled him hor-
ribly

  that was a terrible story you told
last night she said the idea of you
being an artist arent you awful

  eli what how did you guess
he was relieved after the first shock
to realize that she evidently did not hold
his fraud against him

  oh i telephoned around this morn-
ing she said airily you might fool
some people but not me im right on
the job all the time

  he laughed you dont mind do
you  he said tenderly i saw that pic-
ture of you in good old morgie leon-
ards rooms and i fell in love with you
on first sight clean knocked me out-
positively couldnt rest till id met
you

  its wonderful she agreed intro-
spectively it took me just the same
way the minute i laid eyes on you
something inside me said this for
you little girl and i knew i was a
goner loves queer aint it

  rummest thing in the world sweet-
ness said mr van duyck he stopped
the car in the shelter of a friendly curve
and demonstrated the exquisite ruinness
of love by means of a number of kisses
which the fair miriam accepted and re-
turned with unconcealed satisfaction
this pleasing process was subsequently
repeated at frequent intervals and with
each repetition the enslavement of mr
van duyck became more abject he
closed his eyes on each occasion and his
memory instantly summoned before
them the mystically alluring picture
which reposed in the privacy of his
wardrobe he did not see the living
woman in his arms but the counterfeit
presentment of her which had first
stirred his slightly shopworn emotions
roger hartman



and so intricate is the association of
ideas with facts each time that he
kissed the flesh-and-blood girl he seemed
to be kissing the paint-and-canvas vision
of delight he was intensely intoxicated
by the hypnosis of associated thoughts
by the time they stopped for luncheon
he had reached the stage in which he
was pathetically pleading with miss st
qair to dispense with feminine foible
and set forth with him at once upon the
adventurous pathway of romance he
phrased these pleadings in the argot of
his class artfully euphemistic but in-
telligible beyond any doubt to the grati-
fied object of his passion

  she held him at arms length during
their luncheon and for a time there-
after as they continued their search for
landscape beauties amid the westchester
hills but he could see that she was grad-
ually yielding and his pulses throbbed
at the thought he redoubled his ef-
forts at last when they had turned
and were sweeping back toward the city
she abandoned her resistance

  i give up she sighed laying her
head with its peculiar triumph of mil-
linery on his shoulder it doesnt
seem proper but i cant say no any
more id ought to make you wait a
while but-i just cant help myself
you can make me do anything you want
livy dearest

  he checked the car and indulged in
a number of superfluous kisses his
hands were shaking with triumphant ex-
citement he was a wonder with wom-
en-no possible doubt of that wouldnt
old morgie be surprised if he knew
and morgie had actually referred to
this vision of delight as a prune a fine
artist

  hurry up and drive back to town
she said if youre set on to-night
weve got to hustle theres no time to
lose

  why he had intended to avoid
manhattan for the present she sighed
impatiently

  aint that just like a man you
drive back livy van doo-yuk this min-
ute i might have guessed id have to
do the thinking for us both 

  he obeyed deep under the spell of
his imaginary vision of her for some
reason she wished to go back to new
york well new york after all was
an ideal spot for romances such as this
she was right-the country was always
dangerous the city would be best
and as he drove he sank steadily into a
yet more abject state of subjection he
was so wholly in the grip of his antic-
ipations that when he received instruc-
tions to drive downtown he did not
argue an instant not until they reached
city hall did he question her motives
then as he stopped in obedience to her
orders and followed her to the pave-
ment he ventured to inquire what was
the object of this maneuver

  why silly we got to get a license
havent we she said

  mr van duycks head spun for a
giddy instant a license she expected
him to marry her he glanced at her
timidly something in her eyes forbade
him to speak his thoughts he realized
that not only did his courage fail before
the task of suggesting that they dispense
with this tiresome formality but also
shrank from denying her obvious desire
to proceed at once with the matter he
was afraid to tell her that he had enter-
tained a quite different idea it re-
quired more nerve than livy van
duyck possessed to make such a con-
fession with those eyes fixed upon him
and besides he was still under the spell
of his emotions in the light of his vis-
ions of unspeakable bliss the matter of
marriage seemed after all an unimpor-
tant incident scarcely worth arguing
over he yielded without too obvious
reluctance to her guiding grasp of his
arm and presently found himself an-
swering a number of impertinent ques-
tions addressed to him by an interested
clerk beyond a wicket there was also


a look before leaping

some nuisance of signing his proud ag-
gregation of names and tlen with mir-
iam clinging to his arm a brief transi-
tion to another smoke-laden room where
a paunchy person with pendent mus-
tache and a large ruby adorning his
finger asked mpre questions and duly
pronounced them man and wife

  he was vaguely concerned about this
as he drove back to bis familiar section
of town with his suddenly-acquired
spouse beaming from the seat beside
him it impressed him with a sense of
dismay to reflect that this was bound to
be a rather permanent affair but the
thought of the picture in his wardrobe
sustained him nobly after all morgie
leonard was nothing but a dabbler in
art he could not possibly do full jus-
tice to any subject why when the poor
chap tried to paint a carrot even he had
to explain the result to keep his friends
from taking it for a ship at sea or an
explosion in the subway there wasnt
a chance that he had done justice to mir-
iam-not a chance and if she should
be more wonderful than morgies crude
painting- mr van duyck drew a
deep breath he was afraid he might
not be able to survive the wonder of it

  he took her to his apartment the
door-man stared as they entered and
stared harder than ever when livy ex-
plained that the lady was his lawful
wife the elevator-boy was even more
interested but mr van duyck with
the memory of that painting still before
his mental vision paid no heed they
saw only her clothes he saw- and
again he expanded his lungs at the
thought of it

  once inside the apartment with the
door fast-barred he paused and sur-
veyed his wife with a certain hesitancy
never having experimented with matri-
mony he was at a loss as to the proper
procedure under the distracting circum-
stances a happy thought flashed upon
him

  you know that picture old morgie

made of you he said grinning she
nodded well i bought it

  you did where is it

  in my room want to see it

   should say i did just think of
it i didnt know you were so crazy
about me as all that

  throbbing with excitement he led the
way into his bedroom unlocked the
door of his clothes-press and drew out
the portentous painting she was a little
apprehensive at her surroundings he
thought as he turned toward her with
the picturc held so that she could not see
it well the picture would talk he
had a great head posinely he turned
the picture toward her suddenly

 she gasped then she squeaked-
there is no other word to describe the
sound which escaped her parted lips
instantly however these closed firmly
in a thin straight line of disapproval
the ladys rather prominent chin obtrud-
ed more prominently than ever and with
it elevated at an angle of at least forty-
five degrees she stalked out of the bed-
room

  livy van doo-yuk she called im-
peratively put down that disgusting
thing this minute and come here
dumbly his mind dazed the bcnedict
obeyed she surveyed him with strong
disfavor as he stood before her

  how dare you have such a thing in
your rooms she demanded you
bum it right straight up-this minute
but-but hang it all miriam you
posed for it-its you isnt it whats
wrong with my having my wifes pic-
ture-

  your wifes picture indeed do you
thing for a minute id let anybody paint
me like that i should say not why
it isnt decent

  he stared at her vacantly

  then didnt you pose for it it
looks like you-

 me look like that much you
know about it i only posed for the
face

a four-part story - part iii
by blair hall

ix

janet found the first-class compart-
ment empty she was glad that
her journey to london would not
be rendered still less endurable by the
necessity of chatting with some acquaint-
ance her thoughts after her sleepless
night were more company than she de-
sired the memory of anthony jessops
disillusioned eyes which had tortured
her through the wakeful hours of dark-
ness was still with her the thought of
kenneths pitiful bewilderment when
the mother he had learned to adore
should suddenly revert to the mother he
had learned to distrust and fear accused
her as though the cruelty were her own
instead of the blind chance of merciless
fate she closed her eyes and leaned
back against the cushions in a desperate
effort to think her way out of the
dilemma into which her benevolent deceit
had led her and it was because of this
absorption that she failed to witness the
tardy arrival of the honorable muriel
grahame or to observe that this elev-
enth-hour passenger passed her own
compartment and recognized her through
the glass she thus reached london in
complete ignorance of the fact that the
honorable muriel arrived by the same
train she gave her destination to the
taxi-driver without noticing that miss
grahame just behind her must have
overheard the address of lillians flat

  lillian still asleep when janet came
into her over-decorated bedroom lifted
luxuriously lazy arms and yawned with
animal frankness as she woke

well jan ive come to rescue you

at last she drawled in a voice still
heavy with sleep i suppose youre
wild at me for having stayed so long but
i couldnt help it

  what have you done with mr den-
nison demanded janet bluntly lil-
lian laughed-a short ugly mirthless
sound

  oh walter turned out to be a worse
bore than anthony he has the most
absurd notions about propriety-wants
his wife to be something a cut better than
mrs casar i couldnt stand him an-
other week if my life depended on it
so youve left him janets tone
hardened

  it comes to that but he doesnt know
it yet said her cousin thrusting her
bare feet out of bed and feeling about
for her slippers with them too languid
to take the pains of first looking to see
where they were i didnt bum the
bridges exactly-i let him think i was
coming to england on business for a
fortnight or so but ive not the least
idea of ever going back to him again
so make your mind quite easy about the
future im going to settle down as mrs
anthony jessop and behave myself se-
dately forever and ever its time i
gave up my little vacations ive learned
my lesson jan

  do you know that anthony has comc
home janets voice did not waver as
she spoke but it needed all her self-con-
trol to keep it firm and even lillian
dropped the stocking she held and stared
at her cousin janet explained quickly

  a pretty mess commented lillian
acidly when she had finished i must

    this story becjan in the first february number your newsdealer has it
or can get a copy for you


alias mrs jessop

say jan i think youve taken a lot on
yourself it wasnt in the bargain that
you should change my highly satisfactory
domestic relations now ill have the
same tiresome quarrels with anthony
until he has the good sense to pack up
and get out agaii what a nuisance
janet controlled her angry disgust
with an effort and came to her cousins
side lillian i want you to be good
to anthony she said quietly hes a
fine clean straight man who loves you
and deserves to be happy hes crip-
pled and weak and ill hes not fit to
wander about the world any more
wont you try to make him-content
with his home

  lillian stared a slow light dawned in
her eyes and her lips twisted into a hate-
ful smile so thats it eh she mused
in a tone which brought the hot blood to
janets cheek the arctic anthony and
gentle jane have been hitting it off eh
how sweet its evidently just as well
that i decided to drop walter and come
back how long has this been going on 
how far has it gone

  dont be insulting lillian janet
gripped her self-control desperately
theres-theres absolutely nothing be-
tween anthony and me except a deep and
well-deserved respect for him on my part
and a well-earned gratitude on his-for
careful successful nursing through a
dangerous illness a sudden idea came
to her if there were anything more
she added in a different tone you are
scarcely in a position to complain i
dont be so touchy said lillian
quickly i didnt mean anything i
know you pretty well jan its all right
now-im going home ive learned my
lesson and i shant play with matches
any more ill be decent to anthony
too i hove been a pig to him i admit
but its all over now-ive reformed
ill go down this very afternoon

  and mr dennison suggested jan-
et her heart sinking in spite of herself
what about him

  oh he wont care said lillian
lightly he was ready enough to let
ine go hell be glad to be rid of me
if im any judge and if he docs cut
up rough what can he do what is
there to connect me with mrs anthony
jessop the only woman he knows is
janet forde it all fits in beautifully
except that janet forde happens to
be my name objected janet and if
i go back to the states to earn my living
its more than probable that he will trace
me and believe himself married to me
has that phase of the matter suggested
itself to you

  lillian laughed heartily howr splen-
did  dont you see how beautifully it all
fits in you step down as mrs jessop
and i step into your place i step down
as mrs dennison and you become her-
its as easy as easy

  lillian janets voice was stem
the irrepressible lillian felt its icy re-
proof through her mirth and her face
sobered quickly

  dont be stuffy jan i only meant
that if walter wants to know whats be-
come of his wife its you hell trace not
me and of course you dont have to
have anything to do with him unless
you choose you can divorce him or
let him divorce you if you like or you
can collect an allowance from him if
youd rather do that pretty soft 
should say none of the trials of mat-
rimony and all of the privileges

  for a moment janet was about to rebel
it was on her lips to refuse point-blank
to fall in with her cousins plans to as-
sert her intention of continuing in her
present position and defying lillian to
oust her from it strategically all the
advantage lay with her lillian invited
the unromantic interest of the british
penal code if she declared herself she
faced not only the opprobrium of the
divorce courts but the practical cer-
tainty of a term in prison her lips were
sealed if janet chose to cling to the
name which she wore her cousin was
blair hall



practically powerless to disturb her
but as if she read the thought lillian
voiced the vital weakness of janets po-
sition

  of course i know you can make it
unpleasant for me if you like she ad-
mitted lightly but dont forget that
 can make it almost as unpleasant for
you for four months youve been liv-
ing in my house with my husband as his
wife what are people going to think
and say about that miss puritan inno-
cence why the case is interesting
enough to be table-talk on two continents
lor weeks itll drive the war news off
the front page

  janet realized that despite the strength
of her legal position she was powerless
against lillian once the latter chose to
risk the consequences of her reckless-
ness for lillian cared only for her-
self the effect of her deeds upon the
other actors in the drama was of less
than no concern to her she was utterly
careless of the fact that her father would
be humbled to the dust that anthony
jessop and his little son would be marked
for life with a scandal which would not
down that walter dennison would suf-
fer almost as deeply as she that janet
would be branded as a conscienceless and
degraded sinner as guilty as the guilty
woman herself while to janet all these
considerations were far more potent than
the possible effect of disclosure upon
her own fortunes she might face dis-
grace and scandal for herself but she
could not would not bring it upon others
as innocent of ill intent as she the only
safe course was that which lillian coolly
proposed unhappy as her return would
inevitably make anthony and kenneth
it was preferable to what must eventually
happen if she invited the unmasking
which would take the world into the
plot janet surrendered without offering
battle

  very well she said til try to
tell you everything thats happened while
ive been at monks grace so that you

can manage to avoid suspicion when you
go down i- took the precaution to
quarrel with anthony last night as soon
as id finished talking with you on the
telephone and hell be prepared to find
you vastly different from the woman
hes known for the past few weeks i-
the telephone-bell tinkled lillian
halt-dressed shuffled across the room to
answer it janet saw her face brighten
suddenly

  oh good morning how nice of you
to ring me up    what again   
oh i am so sorry but its quite impos-
sible  id love to but simply must
leave town this afternoon    no of
course not hes in the states but   
well hold the line a moment and i
see what can be done

  jan a-a friend of mine wants me
to dine with him this evening and i-
i want to go it will be my last chance
for years and years to enjoy myself and
i-i cant stand the idea of burying my-
self alive down there in kent without
this one last fling will you stay here
to-night and let me go down to-morrow 
you can wire them that youre with me
you know

  janet thought swiftly desperately
every instinct urged her to postpone the
moment of final rupture with the life she
had come to love every instant of delay
was so much gained so much chance for
the reprieve or pardcn for which she
despairingly hoped too every hour
added between the time c i her departure
from kent and the arrival of lillian to
take her place made the possibility of dis-
covery more remote they were won-
derfully alike in physical appearance in
gesture in voice in manner but there
were still enough differences to make the
change all but obvious should an insuf-
ficient interval elapse to dim the percep-
tions of those who stayed ehind in
kent she assented reluctantly so far
as outward seeming indicated her atti-
tude but inwardly she was fiercely glad
of the delay fiercely hopeful that some-


alias mrs jessop

thing might yet intervene to change lil-
lians resolve her cousin kissed her en-
thusiastically and skipped almost girl-
ishly back to the telephone

  i can manage it she cried musically
into the transmitter i really shouldnt
but i will    yes at eight    oh
you think so do you well dont set
your heart on it    at eight then
good-by

  the words were innocent enough but
the coquetry of lillians tone seemed to
janet to shriek a secondary meaning it
reminded her of the women she had
known in the lower levels of her profes-
sion-the women who used the stage as
a convenient stepping-stone to the prof-
itable practice of an art which is older
than the drama by some thousands of
years and it was to this woman fresh
lrom an evening with the kind of man
to whom women speak in that unmis-
takably eloquent tone to whom she was
surrendering her place her hard-won
friendships her loved home her serv-
ants her foster-son and yes-she used
the word defiantly challenginglv in her
thought-her husband

  lillian returned after dawn to quiet
janets fears lest some accident had over-
taken her but also to arouse her suspi-
cions of something almost as serious for
she had plainly passed a hilarious even-
ing if nothing worse her eyes were
bright and her cheeks flushed beneath the
powder and rouge she laughed too much
and too loudly to please janet and re-
fused to explain where she had spent the
intervening hours beyond repeating un-
der questioning as she undressed in the
careless fashion which janet remembered
so well that london had livened up
amazingly since she had left it and that
she intended to see a little more of its
new activities before burying herself in
kent

  she was even less communicative
when she awakened well into the after-
noon cross and nervous and pale she
snapped at her cousin at the first sign of

expostulation and flatly refused to con-
sider setting out at once for monks
grace she had already accepted an in-
vitation for the evening she declared
and nothing would move her from her
determination to keep it one argument
which she advanced in defense of this
position had weight with janet she
pointed out that the longer the lapse of
time between janets disappearance and
lillians arrival to resume her place the
less probability would there be that the
people at monks grace would suspect
the truth the longer the opportunity
given them to forget minor details of ap-
pearance the safer the second substitu-
tion must be realizing this janet was
the more reconciled to her cousins
change in plan though when lillian re-
turned for the second time well after
dawn and in an even more obviously ex-
cited condition her fears were aroused
again it seemed impossible that this
reckless selfish sharp-tongued woman
would fit into the life at monks grace
without forcing anthony and the serv-
ants to realize that more than a mere
change in mood had taken place in the
mistress of the manor she compro-
mised with her misgivings by sending
daily wires to anthony and kenneth al-
though she knew that this very mark of
affection would increase the danger of
the second exchange of identities

how good of you to come anthony 

  the honorable muriel grahame sur-
veyed with eyes which revealed an ap-
proval unwontedly frank the tall lean
figure in faultless evening dress not
even the stick on which he leaned with a
suggestion of bodily weakness could less-
en the distinction of anthony jessops
physique and manner crippled he might
be but the defect served only to accent
the lithe strength of the figure the pal-
lor of the face and the lines which suf-
fering had graven on it but heightened
the essential power of the features
blair hall



   you sent for me in such fashion that
i could not fail to come he answered
quietly what is this mysterious af-
fair which concerns-there was the
briefest instant of hesitation before he
completed the question with a half-de-
fiant ring in his tone-my wife

  muriel grahames eyes contracted
ever so slightly at the final words but
her smile did not change

   i will take you to her she promised
cryptically your eyes will tell you bet-
ter than your ears how much she-needs
you have you dined

  he bowed impatiently but lil-
lian-

  a little patience my friend you
will see her shortly arent you the least
bit pleased to see me anthony

  he recovered his self-possession in-
stantly you are good to me muriel
he said affectionately i beg your par-
don for displaying my anxiety so ob-
viously i-lillian-

  what has come over you anthony
her eyes studied him curiously you
have been married nearly a decade i be-
lieve and rumor does not describe you
as exactly an ardent husband whence
and why this sudden concern about the
charming lady who married you after so
many years of-let us say-milder in-
terest she watched his eyes darken
and her manner changed abruptly
come anthony be frank with me-we
can afford to abandon pretense with each
other can wre not i know the truth
about your marriage as well as you know
how bitterly i have repented the folly by
which i made that marriage possible i
know that the girl you married made life
a hell for you till you left her and con-
tinued to amuse herself rather hectically
afterwards why should you behave like
a love-struck schoolboy over her now
he seemed to hesitate between resent-
ment and confidence then his face
cleared and he leaned toward her you
always were a brick muriel ill be
frank with you i hated my wife for

seven years or more i hated her when
she brought me home i distrusted her
while she nursed me i refused to let
myself believe that she had changed but
she must have changed-enormously
the boy worships her there isnt a serv-
ant in the house who isnt her devoted
slave the vicar and his wife adore her
and shes fast friends with the county
from lady ann down in spite of my-
self i couldnt help seeing all that while
i lay there like a trapped rat with noth-
ing to do but w atch and think confound
it all muriel women do change-youve
changed yourself and i was sure lil-
lian had-

  was she repeated the word sig-
nificantly he flushed

  night before last i doubted again
her manner was what it had been in the
bad old days for a few hours i hated
her more than ever but it wouldnt
quite do-you see ive had too much
evidence against it in these months and
its come over me since that i mistook a
momentary lapse for something perma-
nent that i let one minute of reversion
outweigh weeks and months of reform
-that i didnt stand by when she needed
me most your wire made me sure of
it

  and if it should be a momentary
lapse and nothing more anthony
would you-would you feel the same to-
ward her as you did before

  his eyes blazed suddenly id feel
ever so much more he declared i
loved her when she was nothing but a
silly child i hated her when she devel-
oped into a selfish weak-moraled stub-
bornly reckless woman id love her more
than ever if i found that she actually
has managed to remake herself-tri-
umphed over her weakness and made
herself the woman shes seemed to be
these last months that would mean-

  youre abject i perceive she cut
in with an ill-concealed sneer in her
voice im glad i yielded to temptation
and sent for you you need a friend

anthony i felt it and i was right
come

  she led the way from the room with-
out waiting for his answer he followed
her his face puzzled his mind grappling
vainly with this new riddle what had
muriel to do with his perplexities
what brought her back into his life to
clear or further muddle the troubled
waters  her car waited at the door and
they drove in silence for a time then
she suddenly turned to him

  anthony she breathed the dim
light of the street-lamps accentuated the
beauty of her face the flawless perfec-
tion of the features the pale damask of
cheek and throat gleaming against the
collar of sable fur the subtle music of
her voice thrilled him in spite of his anx-
iety and a faint remote hint of the
barely perceptible scent which clung to
her woke a reminiscent stirring of the
old passion for her she leaned very
close the softness of her shoulder against
his arm her eyes looking straight into
his anthony she whispered again i
cant bear it any longer isnt there any
of the old love left dont you care-
have you quite forgotten 

  he ruled his impulses with an effort
which stiffened his muscles tensely so
that she felt the sudden contraction of his
sinews through the intervening folds of
cloth and fur but he did not venture
on speech

  im quite shameless dear she said
softly tears shining in her eyes now and
her voice tremulous with half-repressed
self-pity i sent you away when i was a
silly proud child ive spent my life be-
ing sorry for it and i cant let you go
again for want of a word of truth you
loved me anthony-and men like you
love only once this other woman-

  we are going to her he inter-
rupted quickly hoping to check the con-
fession but she paid no heed

  she cares nothing for you-less than
nothing you have allowed a little kind-
ness to blind you because she nursed

you as she would have nursed a suffering
animal you think she loves you be-
cause you are weak and ill and grateful
you believe you care for her open your
eyes dear and look at the truth at last
let her go-and let us take up life where
we both left off living i-i love you so
anthony

  in spite of himself he was moved
first loves are subtly strong in strong
men like anthony jessop and this wom-
an had stirred a passionate devotion in
him which had left deep scars upon his
sou where the wounds had healed old
memories crowded maddeningly back up-
on him-memories of moments when the
touch of her hand had been enough to
bring his heart into his throat when the
sound of her voice the sight of her pale
loveliness the faint hint of the same
scent that was in his nostrils now had
lifted him into a fools paradise of blind
delight every fibre of his physical be-
ing cried out for her as she leaned toward
him his arms ached with their impulse
to sweep her roughly into their embrace
but his will refused to abdicate its em-
pire though his voice shook as he spoke
its bidding

  dont muriel-its too late for this
please-it hurts me to have you-

  its not too late-its never too late
to make amends for mistakes im tak-
ing you to a place where the scales will
fall from your eyes forever dear when
you have seen for yourself what i have
seen when you know this woman for
what she is and will be always will you
-will you take me back into your heart
and try to love me again

   her lips were very near his the magic
of her thrilled him as it had when life
and love were young and wonderful lil-
lian seemed suddenly vastly remote ut-
terly insignificant all that mattered was
that muriel loved him wanted him again
that she was here beside him calling his
soul to his lips with all the mysterious
allure of her beautiful body and her
thrilling voice lie kissed her almost
blair hall



savagely and felt her shoulders relax as
his arras clasped them close felt for one
giddy instant the fierce joy of the man
who conquers and yields at once but
even in the first madness of the caress
something within him rose and cursed
his weakness and his folly he found
himself holding her helplessly as a bache-
lor holds a baby afraid to release her
and yet absurdly ill at ease foolishly
eager to be relieved of the burden he
could have cried aloud in his relief when
the car stopped suddenly and broke the
tension for them both

  this is the place she whispered her
hands busy with her hair in the instinc-
tive concern of the woman for her ap-
pearance which not even the high peaks
or low abysses of emotion can quite con-
quer he glanced out at a dark unwel-
coming house-a huge dim shape in the
poorly-lighted street the driver opened
the door of the limousine and anthony
helped his guide to descend curiosity
overcoming for the moment the self-
detestation to which he was prey she is-
sued a low command to the servant and
led the way up a short flight of steps to
the door tapping several times on its
slightly shabby panels it swung open
and they stood in the darkness of an an-
techamber he heard a faint click and
blinked as the glare of an electric dark-
lantern flashed into his eyes its quite
all right he heard muriel whisper and
the beam of light flashed toward her
evidently she was a satisfactory sponsor
for the light vanished an inner door
opened and let them into a rather shabby
nondescript hall where a feeble light
overhead revealed nothing more exciting
than a flight of stairs a chair or two
and a keen-eyed manservant who took
anthonys coat and hat and stood aside
for them to pass

  muriel turned to him and proffered a
bit of black silk which he accepted me-
chanically glancing at it curiously and
wondering what it meant with a gasp
of surprise he saw that she had already

adjusted a similar mask over her face

  what does it all mean he demand-
ed

  put on your mask and you shall see
have you never heard of a supper-dub 
she spoke impatiently dont hesitate
-its quite the usual thing to go masked
at this place and you mustnt be recog-
nized

  he obeyed and followed her along the
hall to a closed door she opened it and
stepped into a room beyond over her
shoulder he caught sight of a crowded
dancing-floor flanked by tables at which
men and women many of them masked
sat looking on talking drinking an at-
tendant guided them to a table in a dis-
tant corner and anthony seated himself
to gaze about him in frank curiosity he
had heard sinister whispers of these
places these private rooms which did
not heed the closing hour when more
public resorts put out their lights and
closed their shutters he had thought of
them as mysteriously evil dens where
wickedness unnamable flourished behind
barred doors where the very atmosphere
was ingtinct with subtler vices than those
which flaunted themselves frankly in less
exclusive places and he was a little
disappointed in his first glimpse except
for the secrecy of their entrance the
darkened windows which faced the
street it might have been a dining-and-
dancing-room in any one of a hundred
public resorts he glanced at muriel as
if to voice this impression but she was
not looking at him through the slits of
her mask he could follow her gaze to an-
other corner of the room where a man
and a woman innocent of mask leaned
toward each other in obvious absorption
oblivious to what went on about them
the womans shoulders were toward an-
thony her dress was extreme and dar-
ing revealing her back almost to the
waist-line he could see one hand toying
with a tiny glass of some greenish liquid
as he looked the horror of the place
seemed to break suddenly in upon his

consciousness it ceased to be merely a
resort where the citys gayer and more
reckless souls might indulge in the
franker coarser pleasures denied them
by the rules of more staid places of en-
tertainment and became the insidiously
ugly thing of wliich he had heard
stray whispers the music which he
had scarcely heeded assumed a sin-
ister note a vaguely vicious rhythm
which impacted unpleasantly on his ears
the figures of the dancers suddenly be-
came significant their masked faces subt-
ly suggestive of vague unknown vice
the air was touched with a faint scent
which he identified as the acrid breath of
hashish against the overpowering per-
fume of the exotic blooms with which the
tables were decorated-orchids most of
them-this distant suggestion of the
asiatic drug seemed doubly insidious
he was conscious of a queer shudder of
half-fearful disgust he seemed to be
looking on at some horrid rite of satan-
ism against which not even his sophisti-
cation was proof

  there is the worst man in london
came muriels whisper the man in the
farther corner facing us study him if
you care to know the power of evil to
write itself in human features

   he stared at the man intently admit-
ting that muriels description seemed
justified by the deliberate iniquity which
peeped out of the face pale strong
handsome with a type of satanic beauty
which anthony knew must be insidiously
alluring to women cruel with a refined
intelligent conscious cruelty evil with
the suggestion of subtle nameless sins

   who is he he asked without shift-
ing his gaze from the face

   he passes here as monsieur fleury
she whispered but the name is patently
an alias no one knows whence he came
nor why but he has built up an impreg-
nable position in this underworld by and
through his power over women high and
low it is he who founded this club and
others like it through the women who

come here he has power which reaches
far out into politics and business and he
uses it as evilly as one would guess from
seeing him he is not bad for gain or
from weakness but for the sheer love of
evil if there is a devil he must be this
mans counterpart the-the woman
with him is his newest conquest poor
pitiable fool-see her lean toward him
as if he could be touched by her little
parlor-tricks of eyes and smiles and
speech

  he stared fascinated at the womans
gleaming shoulders and back she had
seemed to possess some mysterious power
to bring home the horrors of the place to
him he heard a sharp quarrel from the
table next his own-a woman sobbing
under her breath and a mans low tones
tense with anger far away he thought
he caught the whir and click of roulette
he was dimly aware that from time to
time people canie and went through the
thick hangings which hid doors leading
farther into this temple of sublimated sin
and subconsciously guessed their errand
to be in quest of something deeper and
uglier than the evils of the dancing-
room with an effort he forced his
mind to its normal sanity

  why did you bring me to this little
comer of hell he asked what has it
all to do with-

  look her voice cut through his
speech like the sudden slashing sweep of
a sword her hand gripped his wrist
with  tense hysterical clutch which sent
a thrill of half-physical pain along his
nerves he followed her glance again
monsieur fleury had risen and as the
woman preceded him from the room she
turned so that for an instant jessop saw
her face he gasped half rising from
his seat the heavy silken hangings
swayed behind them before he recovered
from the first cold stupor of surprise
where or why they had gone did not
matter the womans face had been
enough plainly written on its beauty lay
the confession of the ugly truth if this
blair hall



  were in sootn a temple of sathanas
then the woman at whom he stared trans-
fixed was high priestess of its dreadful
cult and the woman was lillian jes-
sop-his wife

  he did not remember how he escaped
from the suffocating atmosphere of the
club he found himself again in mu-
riels car before his thoughts had settled
to an ordered and continuous current
muriel was whispering to him 

  forgive me anthony but it was the
truest kindness to let you see it for your-
self i could not have told you so that
you would understand and you had to
know-you had to know

   how did you find that hideous place
he demanded what brought you
there 

  that requires explanation indeed
she said quickly i went there because
i heard that she was there it is not
hard to contrive an entree-these differ-
ent worlds overlap one another in lon-
don i saw her there last night i wired
for you on the chance that she would
come again to-night that is all

  he was silent again his mind in the
grip of disillusion for a few short
weeks he had allowed himself to cling to
the fond belief that the leopards spots
may change that the human heart may
cleanse itself the soul of a woman
struggle upwrard from the mire now
he knew knew beyond peradventure that
he had been self-deceived that lillians
apparent regeneration was but an interval
of rest from her diversions that muriel
was right about her the woman at his
side seemed to follow his thought she
leaned against him with a surrender
wonderfully intoxicating to the man who
knew her pride so well

  will you believe me now anthony
she whispered will you-

  with an oath that was half prayer ris-
ing to his lips he took her into his arms
and kissed her-kissed her on eyes and
hair and throat as she lay passively in

his embrace the car halted at her door
before he came back to his senses he
would have followed her in but she
smilingly refused

   i could not trust myself to-night an-
thony she said softly no nor you
dearest come to me to-morrow at
three

   he came down the steps stupidly his
intoxication ebbing as swiftly as it had
risen by the time he stood on the pave-
ment he had realized that he had made
a hideous mistake in permitting his an-
cient passion for muriel to reassert it-
self that he cared nothing for her that
already he had begun to hate her for her
part in the tragedy of the night

   he walked back to his hotel scarcely
conscious of the pain in his injured
knee in his rooms he threw off his
evening clothes but shrank from the
thought of bed after a cold tub he
dressed again in tweeds now and as the
first glow of dawn began to break
through the mirk of the eastern sky he
reached a decision he packed his bag
hastily summoned a porter and despatch-
ed it to the station paying his bill he
took a taxicab and ordered the driver to
take him to the address he had thought-
fully secured from mrs henderson

  pie found himself in the gaudily
furnished reception-room of lillians
flat facing the woman who for better or
worse was his wife-the woman he was
condemned to love until he died so
much at least his nights vigil had taught
him he could no more pluck lillian
jessop from his heart than he could pluck
the heart itself from his body

  he marveled at the sight of her
though with his own eves he had seen
her hushed with alcohol and perhaps
still more insidious drugs only a few
hours since in the midst of the luxur-
iously vicious surroundings of london s
worst temple of sin he found himself
doubting the evidence of his senses and
his memory as he gazed at the clear-eyed
woman who faced him she was pale


ilias mrs jessop

and there was something like terror in
her distended eyes but it was incredible
that she could have so completely ef-
faced the traces of her last-nights orgy
in so short a space she was dressed in
some loose flimsy negligee affair but it
was the sole touch of the intimate in her
appearance as powerless to contradict
the evidence of her face and eyes as if a
marble statue were to be garbed ir a
silken matinee

  what is it anthony she asked he
thought her voice strange and ascribed
it to fright and guilt

  you need nct trouble to act a part
with me he said curtly i saw you
last night i know what brings you to
london we may dispense with pre-
tense i have come to bring you home to
mocks grace dress as quickly as you
can there is a train at eight fifteen

  he saw a swift light hash in her eyes
an involuntary softening curve the cor-
ners of her mouth as though the pros-
pect tempted her and an illogical hope
stirred within him

  i-i cant go quite so soon an-
thony she said- i-i muse wait here
until my-my cousin mrs dennison
comes home if you will come hack at
noon i will go with you but please go
now and let me dress and pack

  he laughed again a harsh unlovely
sound ill wait here thanks he said
i dont care to trust you out of my
sight aain lillian you see you hap-
pen to bear my name and ive become a
little sensitive about it lately dress
and pack nowr i can give you better
than an hour and still catch the train

  janet stared at him in sudden paric
if lillian should come in while he was
here t she must get rid of him at any
cost before his wife arrived to unmask
them both-even at the cost of going
with him and she realized with a pars
at her heart that nothing on earth seemed
so utterly desirable as that-every long-
ing every instinct every impulse
shrieked at her to seize her chance

 after all under the circumstances
would it not be best for them all for her
to return to kent w ith anthony leaving
lilliar to plumb the pleasures of london
as long as she chose was there any
other course open to her could she-
very well she said aloud i shall
need only a few moments wait here
p ease-or no-perhaps you had best
come with me

   fully intended to do so he said
meaningly  shall not trust you out of
my sight until i have you safe at monks
grace

  she flushed hotly and went into a tiny
sieeping-room opening off the larger
apartment jessop followed her with-
out a word she set about packing her
hag and he standing in the doorway
looked on in silence when she had fin-
ished she turned to him a touch of color
glowing in her cheeks

  i must-dress now she said quietly
would you mind shutting that door
until i have finished

  he came into the room and closed the
door behind him without a word she
hesitated her flush deepening and then
as if with a sudden resolution turned
away he watched her as she loosened
the fastening of her matinee his eyes
smouldering she slipped the filmy gar-
ment from her shoulders and in spite

  	himself he felt the thrall of her beauty
trong upon him in the intimacy of
er disarray she seemed suddenly so
utterly desirable that not even the mem-
ory of the nights revelation sufficed to
uiet the fierce impulse which surged up
w ithin him at the sight of her the sheer
semi-translucent garment she wore ac-
centing the cl-arm of the slender grace of
her figure the rubescent damask skin of
arm and throat and breast she slipped
swiftly into her traveling suit her fingers
schooled by hundreds of quick costume
changes in tiny dressing-rooms to sure
deft service despite the stress of emo-
tions which seemed to paralyze her
thought
blair hall



  when she had finished she faced him
i must write a note she said i cant
go without a word to-to my cousin

  very well he agreed curtly but be
quick about it-and make it plain that
you are not returning-ever

  she scribbled a hurried explanation to
lillian while he waited knowing that
her cousin would be quick to fill in the
blanks which her haste made inevitable
and she drew a deep breath of relief
when the cab puffed away from the door
at least they had escaped detection for
the moment whatever might happen
hereafter it could not be as utterly
dreadful as facing anthony jessop in the
presence of his wife whose place she
had occupied for months he did not
speak during the journey and she found
plenty of time to wonder what it had
been that he had seen what had worked
this sudden and startling change in him
but she dared not ask and he offered no
hint not even when in the privacy of the
library at monks grace he curtly issued
his ultimatum

  we need not enter into details he
said with an impersonal coldness in his
voice which hurt her like a physical
blow i might divorce you to be sure
but i do not choose to court publicity for
myself and though i can divorce my
wife there is no way in which my son
can divorce his mother you have amply
proven your unfitness for an liberty of
action you will stay here-a prisoner
in fact if not in name-and you will be-
have as decorously as you have shown
yourself capable of behaving during
these past fewr months if you disobey
i shall take steps far less to your liking
that is ali

  she wrote more fully to lillian that
afternoon unconsciously exaggerating
the unpleasantness of her own position
in her desperate desire to confirm that
irresponsible person in her tentative de-
cision to abandon the idea of returning
to her rightful place she knew better

than to beg lillian to stay away her in-
stinctive estimate of her cousins char-
acter warning her that this would be the
surest way of persuading her to take
the first train for monks grace in-
stead she urged upon her the duty of
instantly forsaking the primrose paths
of nocturnal london for the thorny ways
of righteousness and took pains to base
her appeal upon highly moral grounds
she knew that the very sight of the
word duty would impress her cousin un-
pleasantly she was quite certain that
her letter would incline that pleasure-
mad woman to steer as wide a course as
possible from that of her husband and
his acquaintances

  lillian justified this confidence admir-
ably the return post brought a char-
acteristic scrawl from her flatly refusing
to consider leaving london at present
suggesting instead that as long as janet
had foolishly allowed herself to be drag-
ged back there she might stay as long
as she liked to let jessop domineer over
her she lillian was enjoying herself
far too much to think of burying herself
in the country especially now that an-
thony had set himself up as a family des-
pot

  the letter both comforted and alarmed
janet although she had no guess as
yet as to the details she knew that in
some fashion anthonys path had
crossed lillians in the vexed maze of
london night life and that which had
happened once might easily happen
again the knowledge that her cousin
was in england only a few miles away
from her own secluded retreat disturbed
her disquieted her she wished that
some miracle might recall her to the
states and vaguely considered the advis-
ability of writing anonymously to walter
dennison suggesting that he look out
for his errant spouse she rejected the
idea as likely to prove ineffective at best
and in any case an unworthy rather dis-
honorable expedient and she com-
forted herself with the reflection that it


alias mrs jessop

was easily probable that anthony be-
lieving his wife to be safe under his own
roof would not repeat the london wan-
derings which had so nearly revealed the
secret to him

  in this hope at least she resumed her
interrupted life with very little change
except for her relations with jessop
she continued her work in connection
with the charitable and religious organi-
zations her intimacy with lady ann
now a frequent visitor at monks grace
her busy round of duties in her home
and among her hereditary retainers of
the estate and her intense devotion
to kenneth all as though nothing had
risen to disturb the even tenor of her
ways with anthony she was on terms
of distant politeness not wholly unlike
those which had characterized their ear-
lier relations indeed so brief had been
their interlude of intimacy that not even
the servants observed any radical change
in the status of affairs at monks grace
she saw little of him except at dinner
when he took pains to conduct a suf-
ficiently friendly conversation to satisfy
jubbles alert ears for the rest he was
steadily more absorbed in the manage-
ment of the place or in the military and
political activities of the neighborhood
hi swiftly improving health making it
possible for him to spend most of his
waking hours out of doors

  the days slipped by without excite-
ment gradually janet lost her anxiety
except for a lingering wish that lillian
would recross the atlantic and leave her
insecure position less perilous it
seemed impossible surrounded as she
was by every evidence of acceptance on
the part of the household and the com-
munity that anything could again dis-
turb the peaceful atmosphere of her ref-
uge she did not easily reconcile her-
self to the look in anthonys eyes and
his sedulous avoidance of her hurt her
afresh each time she observed it she
admitted frankly to herself that she
ioed him even though her puritanic

conscience reproved her for the thought
as for a deadly sin and it cut her cruelly
to read in his glance a cold dislike which
was almost loathing but she was rea-
sonable enough to realize that for all its
unpleasantness this attitude on his part
spelt safety for them both from the senti-
ment toward which they had uncon-
sciously strayed she knew fairly well
how near she had been to surrender
when lillians telephone-message had
brought her to her senses and realized
with a kind of gratitude to that unwitting
instrument of providence how mih
worse matters would have been had th
message delayed another hour or t o it
hurt her that the man she loved should
scorn and distrust her but it was easier
to bear than to have him love her

  only once did he return to the subject
of her london sojourn it was when t e
news arrived that the two sons of the
earl of wycke had perished in an ill-
fated attack on the turkish positions t
the dardanelles and that only the feel e
age of the old eari stood between an-
thony and the title he brought her the
word as she wrote busily in her own lit-
tle study and her reception of the tid-
ings seemed to soften him

  oh the poor earl she cried how-
terrible for him

  he hesitated a moment youll le
a countess after all you know he sug-
gested after a pause i suppose that
makes all this sort oi thing worth while
eh he waved a hand as if to include
the house and all its homely duties in the
gesture she flashed quickly

  please dont anthony she said
quietly whatever ive done ive
given you no right to accuse me of that
meanness give-give the devil his due
please

  he bit his lip youre quite right
he said quickly i beg your pardon
and id like to add that tm not urap-
preciative of the way youve accepted the
situation here since-since your return

i-i rather expected you to sulk and
blair hall



fret i realize how vastly different it
is from-from your corner of london
and im genuinely grateful to you for
the way youve played the game lil-
lian

  she hesitated the truth rose unbid-
den to her lips she longed to throw her-
self on his mercy to tell him the heart
of the riddle to enlighten him once for
all as to her character and her motives
the thought of letting him continue to
misjudge her so cruelly seemed unen-
durable but her innate good sense prer
vailed she compromised

  you neednt thank me she said
quietly its strange i know but when
im here i seem to be a different person
 couldnt act otherwise than i do if i
tried its not pretense on my part-
its as natural as breathing i wonder
if you can understand that

  ill try he said shortly i-i
thought youd be more excited about this
news of mine

  im terribly sorry for the earl she
repeated as for the rest of it i-i
wish it were somebody else i like it
here-i dont want to change this for
anything else

  he stared at her his eyebrows arch-
ing and you used to rail at me be-
cause id married you under false pre-
tenses he said drily you used to
say that youd expected to be a countess
at once or-

  anthony she interrupted steadily
ive said and done many things for
which i am heartily sorry cant we
keep on the fresh page instead of going
back to the blotted ones  it does no good
to either of us to open the old wounds
he flushed i apologize once more
you see lillian youre such a riddle to
me that i forget my manners in my itch
to find the answer looking at you now
hearing you speak knowing as i do how
vou spend your time it seems incredible
that you can be the same woman who-
im not the same woman she said
lluntly with a strange joy in uttering

the simple truth for once even though
in her next breath she meant to renew
the falsehood there are many per-
sonalities in every one of us the one
in me which does the things you see me
doing here isnt the one who-who hurt
you anthony try to believe that-it
will help you to understand

  he seemed to soften toward her after
this interview although still on his guard
against the appeal of her better self to
which he had yielded to his cost they
sometimes spent an hour or two of an
evening in the library chatting pleasantly
enough over the affairs of the estate or
the community now and again when
their paths chanced to coincide he rode
in her car or took her in his several
times they dined at neighboring houses
and insensibly approached their old har-
mony in their going and returning
drives he found himself curiously
proud of her after these occasions tak-
ing a strange pleasure in her quiet re-
strained dignity of bearing in her clear
jewel-like beauty her faultless taste in
dress the charm of her voice and the
good-humored wit of her conversation
they were fast approaching their
former footing of friendliness when his
old suspicions were awakened by a new
development

  janet had long since mastered the in-
tricacies of her cousins signature her
check had been honored from the be-
ginning principally perhaps because
they reached her bankers bearing en-
dorsements which made suspicion on
their part absurd but she had patiently
perfected her imitation until it was al-
most exactly the hurried scrawl which
lillian used she felt safe now in with-
drawing her savings from the chicago
bank and depositing them to her crcdit
as lillian tessop in the london banking-
house she did not know why she did
this except that it gave her a feeling of
greater security to have her funds where
she could reach them quickly she had
never used all of the allowance which


alias mrs jessop

anthonys solicitors placed to her credit
quarterly and according to her check-
book she had nearly seven thousand
pounds on deposit-six thousand of
which represented the accumulated pay-
ments of michael forde to his wayward
niece she was stunned therefore to re-
ceive a letter from the bank advising
her that her account was overdrawn by
some fifty pounds and requesting a re-
mittance to cover the deficit at first
she assumed that it was nothing more
serious than a clerical error but an ex-
change of letters quickly proved that
hope groundless her money was spent
-every penny of it and except for a
few small drafts of her own every penny
of it had been drawn in cash by her
cousin

  this was bad enough her next
quarters allowance would not fall due
for six weeks there were a number of
household accounts to be paid and that
overdraft of fifty-odd pounds to be met
at once but to make matters infinitely
worse a letter from lillian calmly ad-
mitted the theft and demanded an instant
remittance under penalty of exposure to
jessop there was nothing for it save
an appeal to anthony for an advance
against next quarter and to janets in-
tense relief he not only granted the sum
she asked but doubled it

   i owe you something he said affably
as he blotted the check this isnt the
allowance at all-its a little token of ap-
preciative gratitude from me for the way
youve played the game

  she thanked him breathlessly and
hurried to post the check to her bankers
she wrote to lillian promising funds at
once but wisely refraining from sending
a check with the letter it was just as
well that her cousin should continue to
regard the account as exhausted for the
present instead on her next trip to the
village she cashed a check and sent the
proceeds to lillian in notes but it was
useless she had counted too confidently
on her cousins habit of taking things for

granted a week later another commu-
nication from her bankers demanded the
repayment of a second overdraft lil-
lian had been quicker than she had

thought

  she dared not go to anthony again
she was at her wits end when it oc-
curred to her to cable michael forde
twelve hours after her message had
been filed she had her answer

  two thousand pounds to your credit by
cable to-day positively no more this year stop
extravagance forde

  she could have wept with relief de-
spite her sorrow in the discovery that
lillian had already exhausted michael
fordes generosity and injured if not
destroyed his new conception of the
daughter he adored wiser now she
wired her bankers to repay the over-
draft and forward the remaining funds
to her in the form of a draft she wrote
lillian that her account with them had
been closed and warned her against
further attempts to draw against either
them or her father for the moment
she felt secure it added to her peace
of mind to learn that anthony had been
summoned in haste to wycke to spend
two days or more with the broken old
man whose heir he had become he
had hardly set out on his journey north
however when a frantic telegram from
lillian demanded her instant presence in
london she pondered for an hour be-
fore she yielded then with a hastily-
packed bag she caught the express

  she found her cousin desperately in
need of money utterly proof against
persuasion expostulation and reason-
ing alike intent only upon securing a
supply of hard cash nothing else
would serve and she must have it in-
stantly against her better judgment
janet agreed to furnish a further ad-
vance she had brought with her the
draft which represented her uncles gift
and by dint of haste reached the bank
which had drawn it before closing hour
securing a new draft for a sum smaller
blair hall



by five hundred pounds and the balance
in notes which she turned over to lil-
lian making it as plain as she could to
her sullen defiant cousin that no more
funds would be forthcoming until the
next quarter-day and that the amount
available then would be strictly limited
they parted coldly janet thoroughly dis-
gusted lillian resentful and sulky jan-
et attended to a number of accumulated
errands dined at a quiet hotel and re-
turned to monks grace by the late train
some hours later lillian saw her last
counter follow its predecessors into the
croupiers clutches and replenished her
store by writing a check for monsieur
jacques fleury known to his acquaint-
ances as the worst man in london the
slip of paper cost monsieur fleury five
hundred guineas but he smiled amiably
when the suburban and oriental bank-
informed him that though genuine it
was worthless worthless it was re-
markable how dull-witted bankers could
be

xii

 mr jacques fleury

  janets brows arched as she glanced
at the card did he mention his er-
rand jubble she inquired

  he said you would be expecting him
maam

  ill see him decided janet remem-
bering that lady ann had spoken of re-
ferring a french red cross agent to her
and concluding that this was he she
entered the reception-room with an ex-
pression of cordial welcome which faded
instantly as she faced her caller total
stranger as the man was there was that
in his eves in the thin cruel lips the
smile which was almost a sneer which
repelled her instinctively

  you wished to see me monsieur 
she asked coldly as the man did not
speak

  on business of a delicate and private
nature madame he bowed low
janet motioned jubble to go instinctively

making sure that she was within reach
of the bell fleury waited until the
sound of jubbles padded step had died
away and then with a catlike stealth
sprang to the door and glanced to each
side along the corridor janet stared
blankly as he turned

  you were foolish to dream that you
could escape me he said softly com-
ing toward her and here where of all
places i should seek you first i forgive
you the injury to my devoted heart but
not the slight to my intelligence

 you are making some absurd mis-
take monsieur said janet her heart
pounding at her throat but her manner
thanks to the long habit of the stage
calmly cold you speak as if you were
acquainted with me despite the fact that
i have never seen you before if you
have business with mrs anthony jes-
sop be good enough to state it at once
if not- she reached for the bell
he checked her quickly with a gesture
which she obeyed by instinct

  there is no mistake unless you ring
that bell he said his lips drawing back
from his gleaming predatory teeth in a
mirthless smile it is the first time that
i have met mrs anthony jessop but
am i not fairly familiar to-shall we
say mrs dennison it would be in-
discreet to summon servants to hear that
which i have come to say to-mrs jes-
sop

 janet managed to smile if you
know mrs dennison she said your
mistake is easy to pardon she is my
cousin and resembles me very closely in-
deed but mrs dennison is in london

  was in london he amended per-
mit me to say that the resemblance is re-
markable madame yes extraordinary
mrs dennison is not here then

  monsieur said janet icily your
manner displeases me i think this inter-
view has gone quite far enough again
she stretched out her hand to ring and
again he checked her with the same odd-
ly imperative gesture


alias mrs jessop

  let us have done with fencing
janet he said sharply you are mad
to imagine that i could be deceived by a
trick so transparent it annoys me that
you should so underrate my intelligence
be good enough to drop your foolish
pose the time fcas come for us to un-
derstand each other plainly

  i assure you that you are in error
monsieur i cannot listen to a conver-
sation intended for another if you will
not leave me-

  his eyes hardened janet you are
doing a very dangerous thing you are
annoying me after i have warned you
i do not warn twice you evidently
realize the precarious position in which
you stand or you would not have tried
to escape me by leaving london and
coming here let me make it clear to
you that it is my intention to utilize
that position-and my fortunate know-
ledge of it-to the utmost if you have
been under the illusion that my attitude
toward you was dictated by any-tend-
erness disabuse your mind of it at once
i have cultivated you deliberately in
order to make you useful to me am i
quite plain

  quite and now since you refuse to
heed my requests for your leaving i
am obliged to- again janets hand
hovered over the bell to abandon its in-
tent in obedience to the quick gesture
his eyes glinted dangerously

  enough you want the servants
even less than i do i know it-you
know it listen to me carefully i hold
your check for five hundred guineas-a
check which you knew to be worthless
when you gave it-in return for cash
you are in error persisted janet
though with a cold thrill at her heart
if mrs dennison gave you a check-as
i imagine she did-

  a check signed lillian forde jes-
sop remember he interrupted his
mirthless menacing smile reappearing

  then i can account for the non-
payment the check is one drawn prior

to the removal of my account which-
which i believed to have been destroyed
-i will cash it for you if that is what
brings you

  you have not enough money to buy
that check from me janet-nor will you
have when you are the countess of
wycke but since you insist upon your
foolish fiction of resemblance let me tell
you at once that i saw you write the
check you thought yourself unob-
served but you were not and the
check which mrs dennison signed with
mrs jessops name is declared by mrs
jessops bankers to be genuine let us
be frank with each other please

  janets brain reeled for the moment
her self-command left her panic
clutched icily at her heart monsieur
jacques fleury observed her pallor with
that same vulpine gleam of teeth which
passed as a smile

  mrs dennison and mrs jessop hav-
ing been proved to be one and the same
person and the proof thereof in the
form of that check and of several rather
indiscreet notes in the same peculiar
script let us proceed

  leave this house janets numbed
faculties could suggest no better re-
sponse the worst man in london shook
his head almost sadly

  janet why will you compel me to be
brutal with you he reproved her do
you not realize what this means to me-
to me who have seen the entry on the
register at st georges-the signature
in your admitted and proved hand show-
ing beyond question that while you were
still anthony jessops lawful wife you
married walter dennison he paused
watching her terror with keen apprecia-
tion this means dear lady that
whenever i choose to communicate with
the police you will find yourself facing
a charge of bigamy-a charge on which
you will indubitably be convicted

  you-you wouldnt it was the
only reply she could find he smiled
again
blair hall



  of course not-unless you persist in
your folly of opposing my wishes i
have little to gain from bringing you to
public shame and a prison sentence-ex-
cept the moral effect which such a cat-
astrophe would exert upon certain other
indiscreet ladies who are sometimes so
ill-advised as to be refractory i should
take such a step with the most extreme
reluctance

  then what do you want she was
afraid of him now almost as terrified
as she would have been had she known
him for the merciless scoundrel he was

  to-day-nothing eventually a great
deal as the countess of wycke your
friendship will be of value to me in
many ways you will invite me to your
home-introduce me to your acquaint-
ances-assist me in making this unas-
sailable position of substantial value as
i may direct this visit is purely one
of admonition i wished you to under-
stand at once where you stood-to pun-
ish you a little for thinking so poorly of
my intelligence as to try to run away
from me

  lillian anthony jessops voice
broke in upon the half-stupor which
possessed her like an accusing cry of
conscience she turned to see him pale
tense standing at the door of the little
writing-room fleury who must have
been no less startled than she by the
sudden advent of her husband showed
no sign of embarrassment he bowed
and glanced at her as if to await her
presentation

  anthony-this man-this man-
she could find no words she only knew
that all her heart cried out for the pro-
tection and championship which she had
a wifes right to except from this cold
stern englishman and her instinct
brought her blindly to him he disen-
gaged himself from her impulsive clasp
thrusting her swiftly though not without
a certain chivalrous gentleness to one
side so that he might the better confront
her persecutor

  mr fleury i believe his voice was
toneless fleury bowed low

  it is an honor indeed to discover that
i am known to mr jessop he said

  the word sounds strange on the lips
of a blackmailer said anthony calmly
i heard enough of your conversation to
my wife to place you accurately you
have chosen a trade which to offset
its dirt has a certain element of safety
i fancy you consider that you are safe
even now

  that is my impression fleury
took the insult without a quiver though
his eyes flickered with a sudden gleam
at the one ugly word jessop laughed

  fleury-if that is your name-you
were never more mistaken in your pesti-
lent career-except once the single
exception concerns a rather more serious
mistake than your present error how-
ever you would probably shriek un-
pleasantly in the dock it is that which
persuades me to the folly- of giving you
forty-eight hours to leave the country
i should suggest that you avoid-shall
we say-paris fleury that is all
you may go he rang the bell

  the worst man in london wavered
he opened his lips to speak thought bet-
ter of it and bowed instead a measure
of his normal poise returned to him with
the gesture

  threatened men live long i believe-
he remarked suavely especially when
the threat is founded upon what our
american friends call bluff but i in-
trude upon an affecting domesticity a
thousand pardons au revoir mad-
ame

  he made a noiseless exit before the
inscrutable jubble jessop surveyed
janet in silence she could not collect
her wits a vast desire to justify her-
self in those cold searching eyes ob-
sessed her	n

  its all a frightful mistake anthony
she cried you must believe in me
whatever ive done that man has ro
place or part in my life i never saw


the rose o shame

him until i found him here just now
i-

 you forget that i brought you home
from london because i objected to find-
ing you at probably the worst den in the
city with that man he said ive
driven him off for the moment by the
wildest kind of blind bluff but he isnt
beaten lies will only make matters
worse i suggest that you tell me the
truth by way of variety lillian is it
true that you married some one else

 the fourth and concluding part

while i was away a he said he could
prove let me know the worst at once
please and i hope you realize the truth
would be advisable just now

    her lips were framing her denial when
jubble appeared at the doorway she
took the card from his salver mechan-
ically and the room swam as she read
the name it bore anthony caught her
as she swayed and took the card from
her hand he read it aloud

        the rose o shame

 by dick r walker

           taint your cheeks with the rose o shame

                  tis the flower men buy with the reddest gold
            and wanton harlot and courtezan

            have flaunted its bloom since the world began-

            o rose o shame as the centuries old

             tis the flower that bloomed neath the eden-tree

            with the knowledge and passion that came to man
            where once in your cheeks bloomed the lily-flower
            now the rose o shame knows a sultry hour

             o rose o shame since the world began 

 jhere are lots of hard falls but the man who falls over the big bluff he him-
    self put up gets the hardest fall of all
chaste lucy

or

chasing the chaser

from the avalanche of jingles which descended upon our defenseless heads
we are inclined to think that an anxious world has been awaiting chaste
lucys advent to display its poetic fervor in four-line effusions hun-
dreds thousands mil-no not millions though we almost said it we instinctive-
ly think of millions when we contemplate the stack of mail but truth compels
us to refrain at least for another few days then no doubt millions will be
correct

    at any rate there was quite enough to show us that chaste lucy had met
with instant popularity and to enable us to select the following offerings from
among those submitted

    some of our readers expressed disappointment because we did not publish
any jingles in the second february issue but as that issue went to press before
the day of publication of the first issue in which the announcement of the contest
was made naturally we had no jingles to publish so we are sure that you will
understand and we hope you will enjoy the following

this is modest even if unhygienic	clear case for the s p c a

perhaps a vacuum-cleaner
lucy never wanders from

we suspect the cow

 the straight and narrow path
 she even keeps on all her clothes

 lucy is so pure so good
 she really cant endure

 wheneer she takes a bath

 to take a simple drink of milk
 if she thinks it impure

now what dye think of that or this
there are others

saves dusting-though on second thought

 therere other ways of raising the dust

fluffy ruffles

 lucy is so good so pure

 so virtuous forsooth

 there are folks say she hesitates
 to tell the naked truth

 lucy is so good so pure
 immodesty her plagues

 why even all her furniture
 has panties on its legs


chaste lucy or chasing the chaser

 oh tut tut

recommended for the ivin
ter garden also
lucys so chaste in winler-time
smoked glass her eyesight dims

 so shell not have to gaze upon
 the trees with naked limbs

 remember if you dont like these we didn t
 write em

how about when she draws
it off

 lucy is so good so pure

 shes neirer bold or shocking

 she even closes tight her eyes
 when she draws on her stocking

 well we dont admire em either-for
 women

an unpaid-for advertise-
ment
lucy is so good so pure

 front wickedness she flees

 her room must be quite dark before
 shell don her b v ds

 bowwow every dog must have its day

going to the dogs
to a dog-shmu once did lucy go-

 her recklessness she rued

 a hairless dog from mexico
 did shock much-twas nude

 cant help wondering if hed ever want to

hes a shameless little beg-
gar

 lucys so chaste if cupid bold
 should undertake to spear her

 hed have to put on lots of clothes
 before he could get near her

 well we dont blame her still with the
 high cost of living-

she wouldnt marry one
either
lucy is so pure so good
to tell this we are glad

 she will not even eat an egg
 if she thinks it is bad

    there are ten choice gems from the inspired pens of some of our readers
in the next issue we shall furnish more if we are able to dig our way out from
the horde that threatens to overwhelm us after our experience in digging
through these envelopes we will be invaluable in the sapper and miner corps
if the united states goes to war-the trench-diggers will have nothing on us

    oh but here is something we want lo tell you we do not wish any one
to think that we are ridiculing purity or chastity we respect and reverence
both the chaste lucy whose characteristics are celebrated in rhyme is rep-
resentative merely of false modesty of hypocritical virtue weve no patience
with such traits there was a time when the fact that ladies had legs was care-
fully concealed those were the days when a pale complexion a bird-like appe-
tite and an ability to faint on the slightest provocation were admired attributes
of womanhood but the girl of to-day is different she can ride row swim
play golf and tennis she is healthy full-blooded vigorous and she is just
as innocent even if far less ignorant
