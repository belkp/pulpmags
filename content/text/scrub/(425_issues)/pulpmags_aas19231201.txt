hy thats my third increase in a
year it just shows what special train-
ing will do for a man when i left
school to go to work i couldnt do anything in
particular all i could hope for was just a job
-and thats what i got at  a month for
routine unskilled work i stayed at it for three
years with one small increase each year
  then one day i woke up i found i wasnt
getting ahead simply because i couldnt do any
one thing well i decided right then to put in
an hour after supper each night preparing
myself for more important work so i wrote
to scranton and arranged for a course that
would give me special training for our business
  why in a few months i had a whole new
vision of my work and its possibilities you
see i was just beginning to really understand
it i made some suggestions to the manager
and he was immensely pleased said he had
noticed how much better i was doing lately
and wished he had more like me
  just after that an opening came and he
gave me my chance-at an increase of  a
month then i really began to grow six
months later i was put in charge of my de-
partment and my salary went up again since
then ive had two increases of  a month
and now ive got another  raise
  for  years the international correspond-
ence schools have been helping men and women
everywhere to win promotion to earn more
money to have happy prosperous homes to
know the joy of getting ahead in business and
in life

ten years older not only that the excess weight and increased
heart action saps vitality and energy

promrly your food should be turned into firm solid flesh and
muscle as your weight comes down to normal you should ex-
perience a delightful and amazing improvement in your appearance

le vounger you should also be in b-tter health-a real health

svend the bloody
billow upon billow the mist rolled
away from the fiord up over the
rocky beach over the wooded slope
on and up into the hills where the dense
green forest shielded black aisles in which
wild beasts frolicked and evil spirits out-
cast by odin and thor held sinister sway
  now the waters of the fiord danced and
sparkled in the sudden glory of the rising
sun and sea fowl commenced their raucous
squawkings as they breakfasted and fought

sleepy thralls appeared about the great es-
tablishment of svend the bloody the big
log house at the edge of the dark forest
with its half score of smaller out buildings
smoke issued from vents in the sloping
roof the odor of scorching meat stole
through the air
  the huge gates were thrown open and
dogs charged forth to snap and snarl at
one another as they took their morning run
sheep and swine wandered slowly toward
the edge of the wood for forage horses
fed in the clearing

metal as a man at arms shifted battle-ax
from shoulder to shoulder a shield
maiden came forth in gleaming corselet and
bright kirtle and heavy sandals her fair
hair streaming down her back and almost
to her knees she followed a trail through
the brush to a rushing stream that tumbled
down from the hills-the bathing place of
the maidens where they plunged laughing
and shouting into the melted ice and snow
  far away on the headland a tall and
slender thrall stood to his feet as the mist
rose out of the sea shaded his eyes with
his hands and looked long at the ship in
the offing then he buckled his leather
belt tighter made certain that his sandals
were secure turned inhaled a deep breath
-and ran
  he was high above the shore of the fiord
yet he knew the country well and not for
nothing had he been named the swift his
elbows glued to his sides his head bent
slightly backward his torso held straight-
he knew the proper method of running al-
beit that it was natural with him and not
a thing acquired
  on he ran skipping brooks where the
melted snow had come down from the head-
lands to swell the flood he darted through
second growth timber that had grown since
the great fire in the forest years before he
sprang over jumbles of rocks and fought
the tangling vines and tall ferns
  on he ran and now he descended rapid-
ly toward the level of the water in the
far distance he could see curls of smoke
from the chimneys of the house of svend
the bloody the thralls breathing was
more rapid now and the perspiration
streamed down his cheeks and along his
throat his hands were clenched so that
the nails bit into the palms still he ran
nor slackened his speed knowing well what
would occur if he did
  presently he reached the rocky beach
and went forward at a much greater pace
darting to this side and that to avoid the
rougher places once he stumbled but
caught himself before he fell again he
staggered but when his knees and palms
touched the ground he sprang erect again
crouched and once more he ran
  now he was compelled to swim a swift
stream some thirty feet in width emerg-
ing on the opposite bank he took a deep
breath and hurried on dogs barked and
ran to race with him snapping at his heels
other thralls squinted their eyes as he
passed for greater expression of interest
was denied them and might bring a blow
men in armor shouted at him and men at
arms but the thrall gave no heed he had
important news for svend the bloody and
for no other man and as he ran hope
sang in his breast-hope of reward
  the ship had been reported just at dusk
the night before and had anchored to await
the coming of the dawn svend the bloody
had sent his thrall to the headland to watch
for the day and carry true news now in
the great hall of the house svend sat with
his back against the thick wall eating his
morning meat cringing thralls served
him magnus his chief lieutenant sat at
his elbow and imitated him there was no
talk no sound save of men eating with no
regard for table manners
  the thrall dashed through the huge log
gates and into the great hall almost
breathless he prostrated himself before
svend another hundred feet he could not
have gone he gasped for breath and
hoped that his master would give him a mo-
ment before causing him to speak
  svend the bloody put aside the joint of
half-cooked meat from which he had been
eating he scraped his giant hands on the
edge of the board and looked down at the
thrall magnus his lieutenant copied
svends actions
   speak svend commanded
  the thrall raised his head and gulped for
breath with which to give the message
   master i saw the ship in the first rays
of the sun he said
   it is my ship
   it is master
   the one that i sent to gaul
   even that one master the thrall re-
plied  i know the ship well when she
was building i worked on her with the
others it is the ship and none other
svend the bloody got upon his feet and
moved slowly forward he was a giant of
a man even in that land of giants with the
shoulders of an ox his fair hair and shag-
the black jarl
gy beard were noted for their length he
clenched his hands and flexed the muscles
of his great arms then stood for a moment
with his hairy fists planted against his hips
looking down at the thrall
   it is the news that i expected svend
said  you made fair speed here as soon
as you were sure
   i ran with all my strength master to
fetch the news
   you have done well svend the bloody
told him  it is your moment of triumph
you a thrall a common slave have car-
ried important news to your master you
deserve a reward
  the eyes of the thrall glistened
   if only that i might see my normandy
again master he begged if i might
but have my freedom now and permission
to go to my home on some ship-
  svend the bloody suddenly laughed rau-
cously and magnus joined in the big
jarls merriment rang back from the thick
walls though it was laughter yet the
thrall felt a shiver of fear
   so you would leave your kind master
and the fair land in which he rules  svend
said  thrall this is your hour of
triumph as i have said you have done
well were you to continue on earth you
might mar that fair record
  master the thrall was alarmed
now
  you are a swift messenger and odin
has need of such svend continued  we
are not supposed to make sacrifices to him
now so our king olaf trygvesson says
that half-christian monarch who is build-
ing him a city at trondhjem would tell
free-born jarls their manner of conduct in
things religious yet such a deed as this
of yours calls for a sacrifice
   master the thrall wailed
   and so magnus the jarl continued
turning to the man beside him  we are
compelled to conduct ourselves with strate-
gy an indirect sacrifice as a man might
say should not this thrall be sent to the
thralls valhalla wherever that is in the
moment of his greatness
   nothing could be more appropriate
svend magnus replied laughing
  the thrall began whimpering he was
                                
                                
still trembling from his long hard run
and now he trembled also for quite another
reason svend the bloody allowed the ex-
pression of merriment to die out of his face
his eyes narrowed and his brow wrinkled
he bent forward quickly and grasped the
thrall and lifted him from the floor
   master i did my best-
   yet there must be a sacrifice and you
are the nearest said svend  fool to
think that it was good news you brought
by the hammer of thor it was ill news
thrall think you that i rejoice at the ap-
proach of the son of haakon the lover
men may think so but it is not true and
now you have heard me say too much and
so-
   master
   your breath is half gone already and
twill take no great blow to rob you of the
rest of it
  svend the bloody drew back his right
hand doubled his fist and launched it for-
ward there came a scream of pain the
crunching of breaking bones svend the
bloody tossed the quivering body of the
thrall to one side
   not quite dead at the blow but he will
be before the sun is much higher svend
said  i wished to see whether i still could
slay a man with a single blow magnus
we must out and welcome the ship be
careful of your countenance that men may
not guess the truth
   so he has come magnus said
   do not taunt me with it can i do
less than make him welcome my brothers
son is he not a jarl in his own right
yet did his father wed and live his life in
the southland and now that he is gone the
son returns to claim the rights of a jarl
here i fear that we may tread on each
others sandals
   you have but to say the word-
   and you would take your ax to him as
he sleeps it will not do after all he
is my brothers son-and king olaf might
ask questions perchance this young man
does not know that half my estates of a
right belong to him his father was called
haakon the lover because of his softness
the son may be as soft and can be bent to
our will

argosy-allstory weekly
  for a moment he paced back and forth
busy with thought his brow a thunder-
cloud then he stopped his pacing and
raised his voice
   eric he called
  there was a moment of silence and then
another thrall came slowly through the
open door he was a giant almost as huge
as svend the bloody eric the dumb he
was called by men and there was good
reason for it he had been captured while
but a boy during a viking raid in nor-
mandy and the horror of that night had
struck him thick witted he was his mind
and tongue moving slowly he did not re-
member his name and station so svend
had named him eric in derision after a foe
he hated particularly
  eric the dumb folded his arms across
his great chest and stood waiting his eyes
strayed once toward the quivering thing on
the floor
   take that carrion out of here and
throw it from the cliff svend command-
ed in a loud voice
  then the jarl stalked from the room and
into the open followed by magnus
  eric the dumb uttered a little cry of
pain that could not have been heard more
than a dozen feet away he bent over the
quivering body of the thrall and made a
swift examination then he turned his
head toward the doorway and a flash of
hate came from his eyes the dying thrall
had been his best friend and eric the
dumb would not forget
chapter ii
a man comes out of gaul
already the ship was coming down
the fiord she was a picture of a
ship some hundred and seventy feet
from stem to stern and seventeen feet wide
her sails were furled and cascades of
watery gems flashed in the sun as the big
oars worked through the sixteen oar open-
ings
  down on the shore those of the estab-
lishment of svend the bloody made ready
the welcome it was a long time since this
great ship had been sent away to loot to
trade and to return to the land of his
father edvard son of haakon the lover
wherefore women crowded the water front
to greet husbands and sons they had not
seen for long some of them fearing and all
hoping for not always did all of a ships
company return from a perilous voyage
  thralls rushed this way and that prepar-
ing for the landing shield maidens strut-
ted back and forth across the rocky beach
their eyes glinted as they looked at one
another and with reason edvard haak-
onsson so report said was as yet unmar-
ried it was to be expected that he soon
would take one to wife and he was a
man worth the winning
  edvard haakonsson was a jarl and heir
to broad estates moreover he had been
born and reared in that land far to the
south where it was whispered men had
delicious manners they were great lovers
those men of the foreign land and was
not this edvards father known as haakon
the lover
  not a man or woman in the establish-
ment of svend the bloody but knew the
story years before haakon had gone on
a viking cruise and he never had returned
he had met a maid in the land to the south
had wooed and won her and there he had
remained to make his home the north-
land called to him in vain
  and now he was dead and his wife also
and edvard their son alone remained of
the family wherefore he was returning
to claim his place in the land of king olaf
  there was much speculation among the
maidens and not a little among the men
haakon the lover had been a giant of a
man with long fair hair a proper brother
of svend the bloody so far as strength was
concerned yet his great frame protected
the heart of a woman he had been kind
alike to men at arms and thralls he had
been known to weep at the death of a close
friend in battle and a great love had soft-
ened him
  edvard haakonsson these people of
svends supposed would be another such
giant yet in his blood flowed the influ-
ence of the soft land to the south per-
chance his great frame too would hide the
heart of a woman yet he was a jarl
the black jarl

  now the great ship was approaching the
landing place and men and women shout-
ed their greetings thralls waded out into
the water ready to be of service in the
landing there would be great casks of
wine to be taken ashore and carried to the
big house they knew there would be
bundles of other things fetched from the
lands to the south the homecoming
meant naught but much work for the
thralls yet there would be a great feast
at which svend the bloody welcomed his
kinsman and then the thralls would have
tiieir share eating on the floor with the
hounds
  down to the beach svend the bloody
stalked in company of magnus he had
forced a smile to his face and magnus
likewise they stood aloof and others
gave them space
   he will be a hulk of a man with the
heart of a sheep svend said in low tones
 such a man was his father my brother
my mother must have been under the curse
of odin when my brother was born by
the hammer of thor-
   the ship is handled well magnus put
in hoping to change the others manner
   let us hope that she brings a cargo of
profit since she brings this other also
svend whispered  i must be under a
curse myself this and the command to
wait upon king olaf at trondhjem and
the activities of the cursed priests with
their cross-
 i have a thought magnus said
 this nephew of yours svend comes from
a land where the christians rule do you
think it possible-
   that he be a christian svend thun-
dered  a man of my blood fool my
brother may have been and soft but he
died in the grace of odin and went to val-
halla in a viking funeral ship that much
i know would he allow his son to be a
follower of the christ no more words of
this it were an insult even to ask the
lad and after all he is a jarl
  now the ship was near to the land and
the oars were in the craft drifted slowly
toward the landing place the thralls were
up to their knees in the water to their
thighs their necks waiting to help on the
deck of the craft were cheering mariners
and men-at-arms frantic women called to
their loved ones others lifted high above
their heads babes that had been born since
their fathers had sailed away
  the ship grounded and the thralls pulled
her broadside to the land over the side
tumbled a score of men in armor to wade
through the surging waters and so claim the
dry land they shouted brandished their
weapons laughed and called round oaths
because they were home again
  over the side of the ship the end of a
landing stage appeared sailors thrust it
outward and lowered it until its end rested
on the land
   what is this svend roared  is there
a man aboard who cannot jump into the
water and swim or wade to land
   perhaps there are captive women said
magnus
   even so has the day come when a
man cannot pack a captive woman on his
back this is a touch of that southern
softness by the hammer of thor
  svend the bloody started to make his
way toward the landing and magnus
stalked at his heels svend was in an ugly
mood though he endeavored not to show
it he cuffed thralls out of his way he
struck a shield maiden aside and she snarled
at him and put her hand to the dagger at
her waist svend laughed and cuffed her
again
  a child was in his path and he kicked
it aside a girl shouting to one of the
sailors was hurled back into the throng
so svend the bloody made his way down
to the shore and the end of the landing
stage
   hail edvard son of haakon the lov-
er the crowd was shouting hail ed-
vard haakonsson
  the ship was fast at the top of the
landing stage appeared her master he
turned to shout orders to those behind him
and then he walked slowly down to the
beach a giant of a man in armor and hel-
met his fair beard blowing back over one
shoulder a dagger was in his girdle an
ax was fastened to his belt the muscles
stood out in knots on his bare legs beneath
his mail

argosy-allstory weekly
  above him were other men-at-arms
swords and axes gleaming bows arrows
and spears near at hand some were armed
with javelins light and deadly weapons in
the hands of those skilled in their use
they shouted and then they were still
their commander walked on down the land-
ing stage which bent beneath his tread
   hail svend he called lifting a hand
   hail rolf what of the voyage
   one profitable raid and only five men
missing the ships commander replied
 much of value have we aboard to be
landed
   once more you have done well svend
declared  and-my kinsman
   is aboard and ready to land and be
greeted rolf replied
  the ships commander now was at the
foot of the landing stage stfend clasped
him for a moment by the hand then stood
back and spoke in low tones
   what manner of man
   a most peculiar one rolf answered
 he is one not to be judged hastily a
man may make his decision at a first glance
and find later that he has decided amiss
   let him land we wait to welcome
him svend said
  rolf turned and lifted his hand down
the landing stage trooped half a score of
men-at-arms eager to be ashore they
touched the land and stood aside making
an aisle
  edvard haakonsson come to land
svend the bloody called
  the throng ashore stilled its tumult
every eye was upon the top of the landing
stage a man appeared there
  came a gasp from those on the shore
    he is black of hair 
   a black jarl we have
   and small little in stature  a wom-
an cried
  edvard son of haakon the lover
stopped for a moment at the top of the
landing stage he looked at those below
him and his teeth flashed in a smile he
stood in silhouette and those below had
their good look at him
   by the hammer of thor  svend swore
lightly
  for edvard haakonsson did not wear
gleaming mail his bare arms were not
crowded with bracelets to show his jarls
rank his legs were incased in cloth and
he wore a jacket no helmet was upon his
head but that thing known as a hat he
was a picture of the lazy and woman-heart-
ed land to the south
  again he smiled and then he swept down
the landing stage like the breath of a gale
his movements were quick his eyes were
glistening he glanced rapidly from side to
side he came to a stop before svend and
magnus and looked up at them
   you are edvard haakonsson my kins-
man svend demanded as though he
hoped it were not true
   i am and you are svend brother of
my father
   it is so svend agreed  welcome
to the land of your fathers may odin
give you long life and thor lend you his
hammer against your enemies my house
stands open for you 
  without another word svend the bloody
turned his back and stalked through the
crowd magnus beside him edvard haak-
onsson followed beside rolf the crowd
fell back to let them pass thralls gazed
at the black jarl wide eyed eric the
dumb showed a flash of interest because
this man was in part like the men of his
own land the shield maidens with their
helmets of gleaming silver smiled upon him
small he was and black yet he was a
jarl
  they crowded forward closer to look
at him a girl stumbled and fell under
his feet but edvard haakonsson did not
kick her out of the way and shower oaths
upon her he stopped gave an exclama-
tion reached down and gently lifted her to
her feet he brushed some dust from her
kirtle laughed lightly and then walked on
  by odin swore svend the bloody
who had noticed the incident  he is as
soft as his father magnus did you see
 i saw  magnus replied
   he stoops-he a jarl-to lift from the
earth a maiden of no rank at all these
be soft southern ways there are certain
things that this pretty black jarl must be
taught i suppose he would pet a thrall
magnus laughed  any of the shield
the black jarl

maidens could defeat him in combat the
lieutenant said
  edvard had dropped a few feet behind
and was looking back at the ship and now
rolf bent forward and dropped a few words
into magnuss ear
  do not be too quick to judge rolf
said  i am no weakling am i
  by thor-no
   and you would think me able to take
care of myself
   that goes without question
   yet were it not for this black jarl i
would not be with you now rolf declared
 once he saved my life in combat and
once he saved the ship in a storm when
the men were terrified and on the verge of
mutiny and would not work the vessel 
   this man magnus gasped
   that man  rolf said
   a man of his small body
   yet in that small body magnus my
friend he has a thing that not all men
possess in a great degree rolf declared
   what is this thing he possesses of which
you speak
   brains answered rolf  brains
chapter iii
a feast and a combat
throughout the long day thralls
worked at unloading the ship huge
casks were carried to the storehouse of
svend the bloody and bundles of wares
the sailors and men-at-arms frolicked
ashore all made ready for the feast
  inside the great house edvard haakons-
son was given an apartment of his own
where he refreshed himself after the voyage
and then he walked forth into the great
hall again to find svend and magnus and
rolf eating at the big board he joined
them but he did not eat as they ate ed-
vard son of haakon the lover had fas-
tidious manners
  svend eyed him for a time in silence
while magnus grinned into his grease soaked
beard and finally the bloody one saw
fit to speak
   our customs and manners are differ-
ent from yours edvard he said  it is
proper that you dress and conduct yourself
here as we of the norse do
   that is agreed edvard said
   you should dress as a man-at-arms and
on your bare arm wear the bracelets of your
rank such dress as you now wear is fit
only for women
   i can change to armor kinsman
   do so before the feast svend said
 we grow rough here at times when there
is feasting
 and you would do well to watch those
about you magnus put in  some may
entice you to combat to try your strength
edvard turned to look full at him  i
shall be ready he said
  magnus grunted and returned to his eat-
ing the fact that there would be a feast
that night did not prevent him eating his
fill now svend the bloody put aside a
picked bone and leaned back against the
wall
   it is well edvard that you know some-
thing of the times here among the norse
he said
   i am eager to learn edvard declared
his manner was somewhat puzzling he
acted like a man who knew more than he
betrayed svend frowned but continued
his speech
   olaf trygvesson our king is a good
man in many ways yet peculiar svend
said  the christians have won him over
and he would win the remainder of us from
odin and thor he is building him a city
at trondhjem and he has commanded that
all jarls await upon him there we have
been waiting but for your arrival before set-
ting out
   there may be grave trouble svend
continued  there are jarls who have
adopted this new religion hoping thus to
get favor from olaf harald the just-
may the curse of odin be upon him-is
one such
   and where lies his estate edvard
asked
   adjoining mine-that is to say but a
nights march away svend replied  we
have been at warfare for countless moons
our thralls fight when they meet in the
woods and here and there a dead war-
rior is found in the brush with none to tell

argosy-allstory weekly
the manner of his death between the es-
tablishment of harald the just and mine
there can be naught but enmity it is
well that you my kinsman should know
this thing
   i shall remember it edvard replied
   we go to trondhjem to see olaf but
we go prepared i shall take men-at-arms
with me and thralls and pitch a camp out-
side the city olaf is giving a fair but
his real intention is to urge us to peace
twould not surprise me if it be a bloody
fair olaf may turn against the gods and
cling to this new cross but by the ham-
mer of thor he cannot turn all the jarls
with him only a few week-kneed ones
who curry favor at the foot of the throne
olaf perchance will not live to see his beard
grow gray this is the year  as the new
religionists count it from the birth of their
christ for three years has olaf reigned
and for two wears has he been building
his city he is constructing what he calls
a church for this new worship twould
serve him better if he constructed means
of defense
  svend the bloody spoke bitterly but he
was watching edvard closely meanwhile
and this kinsman who had come out of the
south did not betray anything but polite
interest
  to-night we feast then a rest and
then we go to trondhjem svend declared
 we go to the fair-and what happens
jarl you are a man of proper years yet you
are not wed have you put eye on
maiden
   not to any purpose edvard replied
   it were well you did so the estates
of your father are on the other side of
mine but years ago i combined them it
would be a difficult thing to separate them
now it is in my mind that we allow
them to remain as they are and at my
death you shall be jarl over all i have
no son
   the thought pleases me edvard said
 the estates are in good hands
  svend smiled for the first time  then
it is proper that you take a maid to wife
he continued  let not yourself be found
in the years of age without male issue
there is in my household the maid for you
she is a distant kinswoman brynhild by
name a shield maiden
   brynhild edvard said
   a glorious woman jarl big and
strong she can swim the fiord she has
slain a bear with her hands alone she is
tall and straight with fair hair that hangs
below her knees she would bear you
strong sons
   but this woman perchance would not
wish to wed me edvard said
   not wed a jarl when she has nothing
but good birth no fortune of her own
not wed you-if i commanded
   but perchance i would not wish to wed
her edvard said again  if my heart did
not warm toward her-
  svend the bloody stopped him with a
roar of anger  heart  he cried  you
speak of this thing men call love what
has that to do with bringing forth sons
what you want is a woman of skill and
strength a worthy mother of jarls no
more of this now you shall see her to-
night as she sits among her maidens
edvard haakonsson said nothing to that
he pretended to eat the meat before him
but his mind was working swiftly he
foresaw that he would have to handle this
kinsman of his with velvet gloves svend
the bloody was a man used to having his
own way and brooking interference from
none
  he might have been enlightened had he
glanced at magnus at the moment but he
did not for the brow of magnus was black
with wrath and he darted venomous glances
at both edvard and svend magnus long
before had marked brynhild the shield
maiden for his own
  the remainder of the day passed with-
out event and the dusk came out in the
clearing great fires had been lighted in-
side the big hall torches were fastened to
the walls and things had been prepared
for the feast
  oxen sheep and swine had been roasted
wine casks from the land to the south
had been broached men-at-arms thronged
the big hall and thralls scurried here and
there attending to their labors hounds
barked and snarled and fought
  edvard haakonsson came from his own
the black jarl

apartment dressed as befitted the country
he looked more the norse now save for
his dark hair and skin he took his place
at the table beside svend with magnus on
the other side of him rolf sat at svends
other elbow as was his right
  never had edvard seen such a feast as
this huge chunks of meat were devoured
wine was guzzled intoxicated men grew
rough in speech and manner thralls were
cuffed dogs kicked
  the shield maidens had a table of their
own and brynhild sat at the head of it
edvard had looked upon her she was tall
and strong and fair yet the fact that she
was a shield maiden did not prevent her be-
ing woman also perhaps svend had whis-
pered certain things to her the space be-
tween her and edvard haakonsson was
clear and she looked continually across it
   there is a maiden for you svend whis-
pered  mark her well kinsman wed
her and have her bring forth sons then
when i am gone you shall inherit from me
also
   if he outlives you magnus snarled
   i grow old and edvard has youth in
his veins said svend
   yet youth has been slain
   brynhild will make him a fair wife
see how she looks at the youth even now
  magnus saw and growled low down in
his throat brynhild was not the one to
pass by a jarl and accept a jarls lieutenant
her eyes burned with ambition more than
love in her heart she despised the black
jarl for his small stature yet she gladly
would wed with him
  the feast went on warriors were teas-
ing the shield maidens now and scuffling
with them shrieks of merriment rang out
in the great hall dogs fought at the sides
of the tables and thralls scrambled with
them for bits of food
  svend the bloody lurched to his feet a
huge wine goblet in his hand
  drink he cried out above the din
 drink the silent toast
  instantly all was still not a man or
woman there but knew what he meant
and so the toast was drunk and the names
of odin and thor came in whispers from
lips
  svend sat down again half a smile upon
his lips  olaf may be a great man but he
cannot change every heart he muttered
 we march to trondhjem before the sun
twice more has sunk beneath the western
sea and before we return perhaps we shall
know more of the might of thor
  men and women were leaving the tables
now and wandering about the great hall
one by one the shield maidens stopped be-
fore the dais and bowed before svend the
bloody brynhild was the last
  she moved deliberately before him and
once more her eyes sought the face of ed-
vard haakonsson and then she would
have walked on but svend raised a hand
and stopped her
   fairest of the shield maidens he pro-
claimed  our kinsman would greet you
  edvard got slowly to his feet svend
had said it and svend was to be obeyed
he too was a jarl but svend the head of
the family by weight of years
  down from the dais edvard stepped and
went forward brynhild bowed low before
him though in her status of shield maiden
she was not compelled so to do by this
added courtesy she showed the state of her
mind and big magnus growled again into
his beard
  and now edvard son of haakon the
lover did a peculiar thing he reached
forward and took one of brynhilds hands
in his own he lifted it slowly while men
and women wondered and gently he bent
his head and kissed the shield maidens
hand
  there was a murmur of surprise delight
horror brynhild flushed with pleasure
edvard haakonsson stepped back and
again he bowed and then he spoke
  greeting he said my uncle has
wonderful maids about him
  that was all he went back to the dais
and his seat the shield maiden walked on
   is she not a proper maid svend
asked when edvard had regained his seat
   all are proper maids edvard replied
  magnus leaned toward him in his heart
was hatred but he knew that he must con-
duct himself carefully this man was kins-
man of svend and so was entitled to some
consideration yet not even svend could

argosy-allstory weekly
prohibit the outcome of a quarrel this
was norseland where all men be they jarls
or thralls stood by themselves
   she is a wonderful maid magnus said
in his beard  she could pick you up
black jarl and toss you over her shoulder
 possibly edvard said
   when she weds it should be to a man
of might by the hammer of thor she is
for no weakling
  all those at the table heard the words
svends face grew black but he said noth-
ing edvard turned his head and regarded
magnus as he might have a curiosity
   do i understand you to mean that i
am a weakling he asked
  you have not the size of a warrior
scarce magnus sneered
   nor the strength
   nor the strength said magnus
   men have made mistakes before to-
night edvard observed
  magnus lurched toward him and again
he snarled  jarl he said  you have not
your fathers great body and i doubt your
strength you have inherited more from
your mother a woman of that land to the
south where women-
   my mother is not to be mentioned by
your lips edvard warned
   what is this a man may not men-
tion a woman are women then gods to
be treated so
   they are to be treated with love and
respect edvard said
   love respect for women jarl
your body speaks for itself i doubt your
strength and now after your words i
doubt the quality of your brain has your
head been touched and weakened by the
southern sun
  edvard faced him squarely  do you
by any chance doubt my courage also
he asked
  there was a moment of silence every
eye in the great hall was upon those on
the dais edvard son of haakon the lov-
er had put the question and magnus could
do naught but answer an expression of
glee came into the face of magnus what-
ever happened after this svend the bloody
could not hold him to account a man of
rank had the right to protect his honor
   yes jarl i doubt your courage also
magnus said
  rolf the shipmaster gave an exclama-
tion of surprise svend swore roundly
edvard haakonsson got slowly to his feet
a wine goblet was in his hand a moment
he hesitated and then he flung the dregs
of the wine into magnuss face
  the uproar came instantly men sprang
back against the walls shield maidens
hurried aside their eyes glowing thralls
scattered out of the way
  magnus roared like an angry bull as he
wiped the wine from his eyes he glanced
once at svend who gave no sign this
thing was between men and svend could
not take a hand in favoring one or the
other his new-found kinsman he sup-
posed would soon be new-lost in such
event the estates-
  we fight magnus cried
  he sprang down from the dais and wait-
ed edvard wiped the wine from his hands
carefully he was not smiling now his
face was grim he walked down to the
level of the earth floor and stood there
with his hands at his sides
   you are my uncles valued man ed-
vard said  in such case i have no wish
to harm you
   to harm me magnus shrieked
 you shall die jarl by my hands
   nor have i any wish to die at the mo-
ment edvard told him
  svend towered to his feet  what mean
those words he cried  do you of the
blood of haakon my brother turn from
the face of a foe
   i turn from no man edvard replied
 it is but a test of strength and courage
this man of yours demands and i am will-
ing to grant him that it is not necessary
that we fight each other with death-dealing
weapons
   then what would you
   i can throw him
  another moment of silence and then a
roar of laughter in which even the shield
maidens joined
   throw him svend shouted
   throw me magnus shrieked  i
can crush your ribs with my arms far
better you try the ax or javelin
the black jarl

   i have chosen edvard replied  the
right is mine the first insult came from
you
   you would wrestle me in armor
   as we now stand
  magnus scarcely could conceal his de-
light this man would be a baby in his
arms he would crush the ribs of the black
jarl and toss him aside to die then he
would claim the fair brynhild for his own
   make your peace with the gods  mag-
nus cried
  then he rushed but edvard haakons-
son merely stepped aside and let him charge
by magnus turned growling his curses
and once more he rushed and this time
edvard haakonsson did not seek to evade
him
  they clashed their arms entwined their
legs mingled there was a moment of quiet
straining and then the great body of
magnus whirled swiftly to one side and he
crashed to the ground edvard stood over
him hands against hips breathing no heav-
ier at all
  silence for the space of a heartbeat and
then shouts of surprise magnus struggled
to his feet his face purple with wrath
   it was a trick  he roared  i slipped
in wine-
  once more he rushed his rage now was
a terrible thing that the black jarl had
thrown him once was bad enough and
deep down in his heart magnus knew that
it had been no accident the black jarl
had a method of wrestling that was new
  once more they clashed and again there
came that moment of silent straining and
then the body of magnus was whirled aside
again to crash against the floor
  cheers rang up against the beams of the
thatch svend the bloody roared his
laughter
  enough he cried edvard son of
haakon the lover you have methods of
which we know nothing
  a trick magnus shouted again but
they laughed him down
  rolf the shipmaster leaned toward the
man at his side  the black jarl has many
such tricks he whispered
  edvard haakonsson had stepped back
and again placed his hands lightly against
his thighs he was laughing lightly mag-
nus lurched toward him
   there are things besides wrestling
he said  some day we may clash again
and with weapons
   when the day comes you will find me
waiting edvard said
  magnus turned away shouting for wine
his face was still purple with wrath men
were laughing at him behind his back he
knew even the maidens had witnessed
his downfall-and brynhild with them
  edvard walked aside for a space he
leaned against one of the walls watching
the scene men and women walked before
him eyed him his status had changed
somewhat but still they doubted his qual-
ity brynhild stopped beside him
    you are strong jarl she said softly
 magnus was right it was but a clever
trick
   but it served she said i am glad
that i have found favor in your eyes your
kiss still bums my hand
  edvard looked at her quickly laughed
nervously
   twas nothing he said
    such a kiss nothing before guests and
thralls she said  by it you elevated me
to your station jarl i am your bride when
you wish to claim me
   but i meant nothing by it he ex-
plained  in the land from which i come
it is but proper courtesy to greet a woman
so
   she raised her head quickly and her eyes
flashed as she regarded him
   then i am no more to you than any
one of the other maidens she asked
   how could that be since i saw none
of you until to-day he replied
  you do not want me then
  edvard shook his head  i am sorry
he said  i would be your friend-
   there can be no friendship between
us jarl after this
  a moment she looked at him and then
she turned her back upon him and walked
rapidly away edvard haakonsson had
made another enemy and a vindictive one
for brynhild sought out magnus and
whispered in his ear
   kill me this black jarl when you have

argosy-allstory weekly
the opportunity she said hotly  and
then ask svend the bloody for my hand
it will be waiting to clasp yours
chapter iv
at trondhjem
because of circumstances svend the
bloody did not hesitate in leaving
rolf the shipmaster in charge of the
estate with only the ships crew and a
handful of thralls as guards for king
olaf had commanded all the jarls to ap-
pear before him at trondhjem hence none
would be prowling through the forests with
men at arms behind him ready to fall upon
the unprotected domain of a foe
  two days after the arrival of edvard
svend the bloody gave the word and the
start was made svend having some
knowledge of the situation journeyed as
became a jarl of wealth and fame the bet-
ter to make an impression upon king olaf
and upon certain other jarls who might be
close to the throne
  none knew better than svend the bloody
that king olaf had turned christian and
some of his jarls and their households with
him and that olaf was seeking to convert
others yet there were stolid jarls like
svend who clung to the gods of their
fathers and turned against the cross and
this was to be their last stand at trond-
hjem before the king either they won
permission to worship as pleased them or
bloody war would follow
  svend the bloody led his host from the
clearing and took up the trail through the
woods at his side rode magnus and at
his other side edvard behind them came
men at arms mounted and on foot swords-
men and archers and spearmen and then
the armies of thralls tugging with the
oxen at carts that bore svends tents and
booths presents weapons foodstuffs
  they made a brave company as they won
their way slowly through the woods those
in the fore sitting their horses regally their
armor glistening where the sun struggled
through the tree tops their huge swords
clanking their shields swinging each man
with a battle ax at his saddle bow
  throughout the day they marched and
when the dusk came they camped beside a
tumbling stream pitched a few of the tents
cooked and ate and rested edvard haak-
onsson as became his rank had a tent of
his own and eric the dumb to serve him
the choice had been a natural one for
eric the dumb had managed to be close
at hand when the black jarl had wanted a
thrall
  in svends pavilion that night there was
a whispered conversation between himself
and magnus while a sentry stood before the
opening and another at the rear magnus
the sly was not the one to overlook such
a chance
   it is in my mind jarl he said  that
it might be an ill thing to allow this edvard
to see the king
   how so svend demanded
   know you not the story of olaf tryg-
vesson he came of the race of harald
the fair-haired did not his mother carry
him to russia to escape the murder decree
of the wicked gunhild were they not
captured by pirate vikings and sold as
slaves
   but what has that to do with this
affair
   in russia he was well trained for king-
ship after his identity was discovered then
he journeyed to foreign lands to the one
they call greece and there went through
that mysterious rite that the christians call
baptism that softened him and because
he had been a slave he felt pity for the lot
of slaves
   still i do not see-
   he also visited the land of the gauls
and normandy and scotland he raided
britain the mild winds of the southern
countries softened him and this edvard
is new come from there king olaf once
he meets him will observe him well talk
with him perhaps make him a favorite
   by odin svend swore
   he may whisper into the kings ear
jarl that he would like an accounting of
his fathers estate
   by the hammer of thor if he did
that-
   i see that you understand my mean-
ing magnus said  it would have been a
the black jarl

good thing if you had left this black jarl
behind to guard the estate
   but he has come with us svend re-
plied  and how am i to prevent him
seeing olaf it is his right
   being a stranger perhaps that task
will be an easy one magnus answered
 tell him that there may be trouble be-
tween the followers of the gods and the
christian jarls say that you must go to
the king since he has commanded and that
you leave this edvard at the camp in com-
mand in case of a surprise
   by thor that is a rare idea
   i have a rarer one-to split the head of
this black jarl some night while he sleeps
 why not come face to face with him
svend asked
   give me but the chance 
   it will not do after all he is my
brothers son i may have need of him
but i do not trust him yet therefore
say nothing to him regarding our policies
 do not fear i shall exchange words with
him unless it must be done magnus said
   however it will be well to keep him
from olaf i thank you for the thought
 it was freely given magnus replied
 i must face harald the just at trond-
hjem i suppose svend said  each time
i face him it is in my mind to lay open his
brains with an ax thoughts of him dis-
turb my sleep and bother my days
  svend the bloody sought his furs and
magnus left the tent to go to his own
  in the morning the gay company moved
forward again and late that afternoon they
came to the vicinity of trondhjem svend
was one of the last of the jarls to arrive
for the fair he growled angrily as he
ordered his men to pitch the camp he did
not like king olaf and little cared he
whether men knew it
  svend had selected a good place for the
camp on the bank of the fiord and at the
edge of the woods close beside the road
that ran into the town here was water
and fuel and a place easy to defend tents
were pitched and pavilions erected fires
were started meat was roasted other jarls
encamped in the neighborhood sent men
with greetings and svend returned them
they slept and were up with the sun
already the road was a trail of dust clouds
as horsemen and footmen hurried toward
the town jarls rode by with their guards
shield maidens smiled when they saw
svends camp thralls trotted beside the
horses
  svend the bloody ordered out his men
and had the horses made ready magnus
stood to one side talking to two of his war-
riors edvard haakonsson came from his
tent dressed in his armor the bracelets of
rank upon his bare arms
   kinsman svends loud voice called to
him
   jarl
   it is my wish that you remain in the
camp for the day svend said
   remain in the camp edvard gasped
 when there is a fair and a king to be
seen when there are ladies-
   it is a matter of urgency svend de-
clared  in these times it would be un-
wise for me to venture into the town with-
out ample men at my back it would be
unwise also to leave this camp without
leaving some man of proper authority in
command i do not want some christian
jarl to lay waste my goods
   i would make but a poor commander 
edvard said
    it is my wish jarl 
  edvards eyes flashed at the tone for a
moment he looked straight at svend the
bloody
   it is in my mind edvard said  that
it is my right to go to the town
   is there to be dissension between us
 not unless it is of your foolish making
uncle i am a jarl the son of a jarl it
is my right to face the king you have
warriors fit to command the camp what
of this magnus
   i-i wish him to go with me svend
said
   if he were here i might go
   but he will not be here said svend
 if at least two of his lieutenants were
here you might go but i need my men-at-
arms beside me your word jarl your
word that you will neither walk nor ride to
the fair
  again there was silence for a moment
and the black jarl seemed puzzled but

argosy-allstory weekly
presently he raised his head and his eyes
were twinkling
   so be it he said  my honored wrord
that i will neither walk nor ride to the
fair
   and that you will not leave the camp
   and that i will not leave the camp
save if two of your lieutenants are here to
command it
  svend the bloody said nothing more he
swung into his saddle and raised his hand
the others mounted after him the thralls
buckled their belts and prepared to run be-
side the horses magnus turned quickly to
the two warriors with whom he had been
talking
   you understand he whispered  start
with us but drop out along the way re-
turn to the camp and pick a quarrel with
him and then slay he must be dead
before we return make up what story
you will and svend will not punish your
tale will stand there will be none but
thralls to see
  then magnus mounted and cantered
after the jarl
  down the dusty road they went headed
for the town edvard watched until a bend
in the highway sheltered them from his
view he turned back and sat down before
his tent and looked over the camp
  half a score of thralls were going about
their duties eric the dumb was but a
short distance away watching the black
jarl and waiting to be called the light
of adoration was in his eyes eric was slow
of w it but this man caused things to strug-
gle through the mazes of his memory this
man had been in the country eric had once
called home
  the sun rose higher in the heavens ed-
vard haakonsson got up and entered his
tent the manner of svend had puzzled
him and he was not a fool he had given
his word and he would keep it but he
wondered why it had been asked
  presently he heard horsemen in the camp
and went to the door of his tent again two
warriors were dismounting two of mag-
nuss trusted men were they to remain in
the camp edvard might go to the fair and
still keep his oath-providing he did not
walk or ride
  he knew them both by sight but not
by name giants they were and no doubt
great soldiers they stretched their shoul-
ders and threw out their chests and ad-
vanced toward him a few paces away they
stopped and spoke to each other yet the
words were for him to hear
   when a mans body is small so is his
courage
   when a man apes the manners of wom-
en he has the heart of one
   the fairer the hair the fairer the
honor said the first  a man with black
hair is not to be trusted
   it may mean something amiss in his
ancestry the second declared
  edvard haakonsson had smiled at the
first two remarks scowled at the third and
had become enraged at the fourth he
hurled himself forward and confronted
them his eyes blazing his hot southern
blood uppermost for the moment
   you speak of me he demanded
  one sneered at him  if the jarl so
wishes to take it he said
   do i understand that you question my
courage my honor and possibly that of my
parents
   the day is too hot for a man to repeat
his words said the second
  edvard haakonsson took a step back-
ward and looked at them searchingly
   you are of the company of magnus
he accused  why has he sent you is he
afraid to come himself
   what has this to do with magnus
   do you think that i am blind ed-
vard demanded  so it is a game is it
a craven game yet two men against one
is a compliment which of you desires to
cross swords with me first
   the little jarl would fight sneered the
first
  edvard whipped out his sword and lifted
up his shield from before the tent
   if a moment more passes i term you
coward he said
  with a roar of rage the man nearest drew
his blade and darted forward he was no
mean swordsman the second laughed at
the ease of it yet he drew his blade too
and stood ready in case some accident hao-
pened
the black jarl

  the thralls crowded near but not too
near eric the dumb crouched before the
tent making little sounds in his throat the
son of haakon the lover advanced
  the blades touched and then the norse-
man found a game he never had seen be-
fore for the black jarl did not fight in
the usual manner he did not waste his
strength in the weight of a downward stroke
he fenced he darted from side to side
and his blade bit into mail his opponent
made great slashes that cut nothing but the
empty air
  and edvard haakonsson was fighting like
a man who intends to avenge an insult
there was deadly intent in his manner
the big norseman gave ground again and
again he had strength remaining but no
skill to match the skill of the black jarl
  again he whirled and he grunted a word
to his companion into the fray leaped the
other man so that edvard was compelled to
face them both
   so he cried assassination apart
of a foul plot you came back to taunt me
-and kill me but the end is not yet 
to be continued next week

   mys tery
ne by one my friends depart
through a secret door
i have seen so many start
         to return no more
       where the kings and prophets went
thither they have gone
have they found a rich content
as they journeyed on
one by one with solemn tread
         leaving me behind
       friends have joined the quiet dead
whilst i dumb and blind
wondered pondered all in vain
where they traveled far
did they wander in the rain
till they found a star
       if they only could come back
         for one little hour
smiling from the lonely track
noiseless as a flower
i will come when i am dead
knowing love your need
ah how many this have said-
          said it oft indeed
silence and the aching night
nothing through the dark
ghostly moths at candlelight
blundering near the spark
emptiness when but one word
would have meant so much
       what was that which strangely stirred
         did i feel a touch

author of  the hole in the frame zero love etc
a novelette-complete in this issue
sallin smiled cheerfully at viola
the word had just come to him the
promise of action was to his liking
risky action but lucrative he contem-
plated it with the pleasure of the artist
for he was an artist in his own particular
bent
   we move to norford vi he said
   yes  her interest too quickened
viola was his first lieutenant and his reputed
wife she understood the significance of
moving to norford thev had been wait-
ing a long time to do that-for circum-
stances to adjust themselves and make the
effort profitable
   you mean that we can get the house
you spotted she asked
  sallin nodded  its being bought for
us now he looked out from their suite
in the commodore over the ragged scar of
the subway excavation bordering blighting-
ly on pershing square that he should be
looking upon that hole in the ground when
the day arrived for him to go ahead on
the norford prospect seemed to be a favor-
able omen his smile maintained and his
eyes glinted he reviewed the scheme fcr
the execution of which he had waited so
patiently
   thats a hunch vi he remarked
  she moved to the window beside him and
laughed  lets hope she said  its
high time we put something over floyd
since that michigan affair- she paused
in thoughtful silence
  the michigan affair had been bungled
it had cost sallin two men-one shot dead
in the get-away another wounded and cap-
tured it had come near to costing sal-
lin his liberty and for many months had

	a
red for a million

caused him to lead an unobtrusive and un-
productive existence
  sallin drew her onto his knees she
snuggled her head against his
   the angels are with us vi he
smiled  i was getting ready to go after
something-anything the mob have been
getting fidgety duke taylor and mint
odell are talking about cutting loose
think im losing my grip i guess we
can hold em with this norford job cropping
up at just the right moment
   when we get away with this floyd 
-her subdued blue eyes narrowed on him-
 well be set up so we wont have to worry
well be able to quit
  coaxingly she moved her head from side
to side against his as she had a trick of
doing her mass of dark hair rubbing his
graying thatch
   if everything works out right-yes
he answered
 youre going at it the way you doped
 with only one change that i see now
his eyes were laughing as they turned to
hers  were going to make you over
vi before we hit norford
   make me over why i thought we
were to stay quiet while were there
   we will he agreed  but we wont
be such hermits as we figured conditions
have changed since we spotted that place
two years ago theres a little neighbor
youll have to cultivate a girl called bessie
in the house next to ours
   why she asked again
   because one frank denton is sweet on
bessie returned sallin  and frank
denton is cashier of the bank of norford
 oh viola got his drift
   besides he added  its better to give
them plenty of description to work on
they wont see me but they will you so
he grinned  well let them have something
brilliant to remember well make you a
red-head 
  sallin did not think that he was calling
upon her to assume too much of the risk
neither did viola consider that he was
doing so it was necessary that one of
them should be visible to their neighbors
there had to be some contact
  a man cannot alter his appearance as eas-
   	a
ily as can a woman about all he can do
is let the hair grow on his face or shave if
it already is there he has not at his
command the many artifices that a woman
may use the expert application of cos-
metics the artful changing of the style of
dressing her hair and of its color the intro-
duction of a  birthmark manufactured in
a beauty parlor and easily removable when
you tire of it differently fashioned clothing
and millinery the addition innocent ap-
pearing enough of a veil or furs which can
conceal half her features
  in half an hour a woman may change her
appearance radically though he shaves a
beard or grows one a man must continue
to expose distinctive features that cannot
be changed-ears nose and ees the shape
of his face round oval or long he cannot
without being conspicuous heighten his
complexion or reduce it he cannot fix his
hair so that the contour of his face is made
different nor can he achieve the deceiving
result given by the substitution of a wide
floppy hat for a toque
  neither to sallin nor the woman there-
fore did it seem that an unreasonable bur-
den was being placed upon her they di-
vided the chances always if it fell now
to her to hold the spotlight-as much of
the spotlight as they could not evade-that
was entirely fair the likelihood of success
must be vastly diminished if when they
fled a description of sallin could be flashed
over the country
  viola accepted her role then without
demur
   i never have been a red-head have i
she laughed they had a way these two
of going light-heartedly into a dangerous
proposition  ill have a strawberry mark
on the left cheek i guess to match the car-
rots
   and tone up your complexion he sug-
gested further  you want a fair skin
dont you to go with red hair make
yourself genteelly bright without being
noisy you know remember that youve
just suffered a great shock-that tragedy is
with us in the person of dear floyd
   leave it to me she declared  ill
make the picture when do we start
how long do you need to change your

argosy-allstory weekly
spots he chuckled  you cant do it
overnight
  she shook her head  that  take a few
days she loosened her hair and let it
tumble over her shoulders  being dark
ill have to blond it some to make the
henna take three or four days and ill
have it blazing thats what isnt it-a
regular flaming top
   yes the wilder the better so long
as it looks natural sallin glanced at his
watch  suppose you begin at once get
the blondine and the red stuff and what-
ever else you need and begin making over
while i talk with heusler ive sent for
him hell be here in fifteen minutes or so
viola gave a final caressing rub of her
head on his and got up from his knees
   sam is cast for the doctor she queried
while she piled her hair back on her head
   uh-huh having given her her in-
structions sallin desired to devote the time
until the arrival of heusler to a review of
his scheme
  viola had expressed his own hope when
she had inquired whether this effort might
not make possible their retirement sallin
figured that he had been taking chances
long enough he was due to put across a
really big job and quit his luck could not
hold out forever
  the bungling of the robbery in michigan
to which viola had referred had made him
pause he had wondered then if his luck
was not overstrained superstitious he had
read in that failure a warning because for
years he had directed his mob with un-
varying success
  with the patience that had ever charac-
terized his operations he had waited till
the auspices should be favorable to tackling
one of the bigger prospects on his list
  this norford job he had schemed out
minutely long ago the elements in it were
right the engineering was well thought
out in detail all that had been lacking
was the house that he had chosen while
looking over the ground that house now
was available the rest depended upon the
degree of adroitness with which his plans
were carried out
  gazing across forty-second street sal-
lin noted again with satisfaction the exca-
vation that was an eyesore he did not
find it such to him it represented a hunch
  on her way out viola paused  how
much will we draw out of it floyd
  sallin glanced at her dreamily then
for a moment his lips tightened and his
face hardened he relaxed and leaning
back with his hands on the arms of the
chair he resumed his dreaming
  a million he said softly a mil-
lion sure vi-and maybe more
  with a quick step she was beside him
her head bent to touch his
   a million she whispered with a long
breath she gripped his arm her dull
blue eyes took on a sparkle  the biggest
yet floyd weve got to put it over
   you bet we will he laughed quietly
confidently  just as soon as you become
a red-head
ii
  sam heusler was the man who acted
between sallin and certain other members
of his organization as the directing genius
sallin took the precaution of remaining an
invisible quantity to the lesser lights of his
mob to those who could execute daringly
enough when told exactly what to do but
who had not the initiative or the ability to
devise it was advisable that he as the
 master mind should be known only to
his most trusted lieutenants
  in this case it happened that in the
actual operation of taking a million dollars
or more from the bank of norford he re-
quired the services only of heusler and two
others these were duke taylor and mint
odell in whom he also had implicit confi-
dence
  aside from the actual operation how-
ever in the preliminaries he had need of
several others and these were of the type
to whom he preferred to be unknown
their mission would be among the people
of norford among the extensive population
of foreign-born mill workers
  heusler looked big and clumsy in com-
parison with sallins slight figure his
round stolid face was the opposite of sal-
lins keen lively expression which even in
repose reflected the powerful active shrewd
mind
red for a million

  usually heusler served only as a scout
ranging the country to pick out prospects
the norford bank was one of his discov-
eries he had reported it to sallin as a
straight job sallin checking up on it to
confirm the judgment of his scout had seen
the greater possibilities therein lay his
genius-the faculty of looking deep and
evolving a plan that should take advantage
of everything that offered
  the undertaking upon which he was now
embarking was to be the materialization of
sallins dream in the town of norford he
had perceived the essential conditions for
the realization of his pet project the am-
bition which he had nursed and pondered
over eternally-to snatch a million dollars
in a single haul it was not exclusively
applicable to this one town norford was
to be honored merely because it was first
to present the opportunity the field had
to be just right for the attempt norford
satisfied in that particular because of its
many foreign-born
  but the taking of a million dollars from
a bank is something to be gone about
circumspectly there could be nothing pre-
cipitate for that reason sallin had been
content to bide his time
  especially there was the matter of his
own location in the town that had to come
about naturally anxiety to get into a cer-
tain house might well excite suspicion
there must be no suspicion for if he was
to get the million he had to have time to
bring it within reach
  banks outside of the great cities do not
carry anything like a million in cash even
in the great cities few do in a place the
size of norford with about forty thousand
people an institution such as sallin was
aiming at would have nothing approaching
a million a hundred thousand or up to
twice that sum would be a liberal sum
except in an emergency for a bank carrying
the deposits of the bank of norford cash
lying in a vault earns nothing
  sallin consequently purposed placing
the million in the bank of norford before
taking it out that is he would be instru-
mental in placing it there
  because this was to be his grand slam
he was keeping the number of participants
as scant as possible that was why sam
heusler was given an active part
   you can get away with it sam said
sallin  youll motor out from new york
each day thats all motor out and
look as much like a doctor as you can
heusler murmured acquiescence per-
sonally he would rather have stayed out of
sight had this not been scheduled as the
great coup he would have demurred but
he understood that if it were successful
the reward would be adequate and as
sallin pointed out the fewer that were in on
it the bigger would be the split
   ill take taylor and odell with me
said sallin  they can spin a nickel to
decide which will be my valet and which
the handy man round the house viola of
course will be along just five of us
   how about the outside men ques-
tioned heusler  dont they-
   thats where you have to watch your
step interrupted sallin  theyre not to
know whats coming off their job is to
mingle with the people the foreign element
get acquainted and follow orders who
are you going to get two or three will be
enough well give em a thousand apiece
heusler rolled a cigar between his soft
fat hands his rounded face wrinkled
   i was thinking of fiorella and de
real he said  they ought to be able
to work their way into the foreigners de
real has been in russia hes been mixing
with a bolshevik bunch in new york
that  give him an introduction fiorella
can run loose among the italians mostly
slovaks and wops in norford you know
 theyll do said sallin  who else
 theres another bolshevik called kolin-
sky we could get hed be tickled at the
chance it would give him he could go
round bragging afterward on how he helped
smash one little flock of capitalists
   thats the idea approved sallin  if
it looks like bolshevist stuff that  keep it
far away from us there isnt any way it
can connect with us anyhow unless you let
slip something to these birds but we cant
be too much on the safe side have it
look like bolshevist stuff he repeated
 and well be in good shape well give
them enough for expenses and on the face of

argosy-allstory weekly
things they can plead that they are organiz-
ers for the radical crowd if they get into
trouble worst that can happen to them
then will be to get chased out of town as
undesirables
  thoughtfully sam heusler stroked his
plump cheek his gaze ranged over his own
considerable bulk he was wondering how
much he would have to appear in public
  how longs it going to take he asked
	 less than a month said sallin  we
may get through within two weeks youll
send fiorella and de real and our other
bolshevik friend over to norford at once
theyll need time to get proper standing
dont tell them what their real purpose
is until i give the word that  be when
were ready for the smash
   i wont said heusler  but-how
soon do we go there
   about a week sallin grinned  we
have to wait on viola shes out now get-
ting the dope to make herself a red-head for
a million 
 
 that night viola applied herself to an
intensive campaign with peroxide after
that came the plastering of her hair with a
paste made from henna leaves as the egyp-
tian and persian woman does to achieve
the rich luster for which they are famed
and to hasten the process she held her head
over a kettle steaming on an electric grill
in her room while sallin stood by and mar-
veled at the transformation
m
  norford is what is known as a model
town while most of its population are
mill workers it presents none of the blight
of crowded tenements they are a pros-
perous people and were so even before the
war brought them increased opportunity to
labor at high waegs
   their prosperity and the wise fatherli-
ness of the authorities and the employers is
evidenced by the almost unbroken residen-
tial aspect of the town it is a place of
green lawns and trees with ample space sur-
rounding the homes few of which contain
more than two families the mills lie off to
one side the erection of dwellings having
trended away from rather than around
them to maintain the desired model atmos-
phere with this development the business
and shopping street came to be a pleasant
tree-lined thoroughfare of modern buildings
in keeping with the general plan and reach-
ing wrell into the heart of the better residen-
tial neighborhood
  the house into which sallin and viola
moved was only one street from the busi-
ness artery it was a neat two-storied struc-
ture set like most of the homes in this dis-
trict in the center of two wide lots
  its prime desirability essentiality from
sallins point of view lay in the fact that di-
rectly through the block from it was the
bank of norford it was for this that he
had waited so long-to get the house that
was in the proper relationship to the bank
building for his purpose
  the street on which he located was peo-
pled by business and professional folk the
arrival of the new household w-ould thus
have passed by with no more than the po-
lite scrutiny that is given a newcomer had
it not been for the remarkable appearance
of sallin that was sufficient to create
curiosity among the most uninquisitive
  in the quiet of a summer afternoon a
limousine drew up with sallin and viola
and mint odell who had been lucky enough
to draw the post of valet
  for a couple of days previously furniture
had been going into the house duke tay-
lor accompanied it a pardonable interest
therefore had been aroused and on verandas
round about the womenkind were seated to
obtain an initial glimpse at their latest
neighbors the glimpse turned quickly into
a frank and concerted stare
  viola stepped first from the machine
she guided sallin as he alighted-for sallin
could not see his whole face was covered
with bandages-also his hands he moved
with the groping step of a man recently
deprived of vision his head tilted upward
pathetically as though by straining he would
see his hands outstretched fearfully with
an apparent dread that they might encoun-
ter an obstacle
  with viola on one side and odell on the
other sallin stepped gingerly up the walk
to the house the strange procession was
red for a million

almost inside before the whispering observ-
ers now patently curious noticed another
item of distinction violas blazing red hair
showing beneath her small modish hat
  but for the spectacle of sallin violas
hair must surely have been instantly the
center of focus it was a glory triumphant
in the sunshine compelling in its fieriness
and dazzling she had indeed reached the
peak of magnificence in carrying out sallins
wish she had attained a shade that was
brilliant yet alluring in its burnished tone
that held the eye and made the beholder
marvel but did not offend
  it crowned her with a splendor at once
ravishing and baffling which was admir-
ably the effect she sought since the vivid-
ness of her hair distracted the gaze from
her features and seemed to make them gen-
erally indistinct her eyes for instance
of a pale blue that never was striking now
appeared to be of a complex tint and quite
negligible they would not impress them-
selves upon any one so that that person
could report positively their color her
mellowed skin too took from her violent
hair a deceiving depth of luster her brows
untouched and dark mirrored a redness
that was not really in them
  viola had worked to perfection in re-
constructing herself for this adventure in
her tender solicitude for sallin likewise she
was well schooled those who watched
them enter the house on their arrival could
not but observe the gentleness with which
she aided his faltering feet up the steps nor
the sweet gesture with which she placed an
arm about him as they went indoors
  had they been permitted to look through
the walls these good people certainly would
have been more amazed than they were by
the sorrowful picture of sallin already given
them
  no sooner was he inside than he started
to emit muffled words through the bandages
which covered even his mouth his white-
swathed hands wagged peremptorily for re-
lief
  laughing viola headed him upstairs
 run and see that the shades are drawn
she instructed odell
  as he went on she stopped sallin on the
stair landing no one could see them there
with rapid fingers she undid a few pins
in the bandages at the back of his head and
the whole came away
   good lord  sallin grinned wryly and
mopped his face with his still enshrouded
hands  whew believe me viola its
hot inside that blanket why the devil
couldnt we get a chance to pull this job
in the middle of winter
  viola pulled off her hat and placed her
head against his in her favorite caress
   i get the best of this floyd she said
gayly  being a red head is easy com-
pared with being embalmed but say-
you sure did give this countryside some-
thing to chatter over i got a flash at some
of them on their porches out of the comer
of my eye and they were hanging over the
rails gaping
  sallin joined her laughter  then theyll
have to look their fill mighty quick vi
he asserted  because were going to cut our
stay as short as possible youll find me
smothered to death one time if i have to
wear that trapping too steadily here -
he extended his hands- get these nui-
sances off too and let me feel human
again
  she unmuffled his fingers and they went
on upstairs to the room where odell had
pulled the shades
  odell grinned  youre some freak in
that get-up chief he remarked  hows
it feel to be all burned up
   try being embalmed as vi calls it for
a few hours in this weather and youll
know returned sallin good naturedly
 hello duke he greeted his other aide
who appeared in the doorway  hows
everything
  duke taylor didnt look any too cheer-
ful
   soft for mint he declared  picking
the easy stunt say chief anxiously  i
dont really have to do anything thats regu-
lar work
   youre the cook and general houseman
duke smiled sallin
   youll make a nifty cook scoffed
odell he referred to the dukes appear-
ance which had won him his nickname
 ill sit by and coach you
   dont coach too hard mint inter-

argosy-allstory weekly
posed sallin  youll get a crack at labor
yourself once we get going
   yeh said taylor  and well let you
do double time for what i do while youre
coaching
   beat it you two put in sallin  i
want to talk with vi youd better chase
out to the hotel down street min and order
dinner sent over dont worry vi will do
the cooking i want to live a while
  odell and taylor departed the former
crowing over his soft berth the latter fling-
ing back that hed see odell did his share
their squabbling however meant nothing
they had been working too long together
to quarrel over the tasks allotted they
respected one anothers talents as they re-
spected sallins ability to conceive and his
generalship odell had earned his soubri-
quet from fellow craftsmen who conceded
that if given half a chance he could carve
a way into the mint as a mechanic whose
expertness was similarly misdirected tay-
lor was no less capable they were the
aces of sallins mob
  when they had gone sallin peered from
behind the drawn shade at the rear of the
bank he intended to make disgorge a mil-
lion his eyes brightened and he motioned
viola to look
   theres the beauty he whispered
 heres where well show them something
new
  her head nestled against his silently
they regarded the stanch building with its
dead rear wall and heavily barred windows
on the sides the immensity of their task
impressed the woman she experienced a
quickening of the pulse this was the first
job in which she had actively engaged at
the consummation in others she had gone
ahead spying and sizing up it w-as the
only time in years also that sallin himself
had taken the field
  he noticed her become rigid and her
hastier breathing
   not nervous vi he asked
   no- but she laughed a trifle shakily
not with fear but excitement  no not
nervous floyd but-its different isnt
it when you actually get into the ring
smiling he put an arm over her shoul-
ders while still they bent watching the bank
building as a hunter watches the approach
of unsuspecting quarry
   its different vi he said earnestly
 but theres something in it that gets you
wait till were reaching out our hands-
  he drew back from the window his
voice lost its tensity they had not ar-
rived at that stage there were prelimi-
naries to be gone through before they would
   see anything of little bessie as we came
in the house to the right
   there was a pretty girl on the porch
said viola  blond not tall
   thats bessie well find an excuse to
get acquainted with her shell be glad
to be the first to hear all about floyds
frightful injury it  give her an edge on
the other folks-and help us out the
sooner the quicker vi so i can unwind
myself-
iv
  in the evening sallin again  em-
balmed sat outside with viola her de-
votion to him was apparent to all who cared
to look but not too effusive sitting on
the arm of his chair she leaned her head
affectionately alongside his while she talked
to him
  the picture was inspiring as it was de-
signed to be and the consuming curiosity
of the neighbors increased to learn what
grievous mishap had befallen sallin
  the top of his head they noticed now
had escaped injury that was because
sallin felt that it would be only an extra
discomfort to swathe his head entirely
the covering of his face was sufficient
  sallin did little more than nod or shake
in reply it was awkward talking through
the encumbering bandages and he was too
hot to be conversationally inclined
  while apparently absorbed in him viola
watched covertly for the opening that would
give an answer to the curious she wanted
to introduce herself to bessie wentworth
  miss wentworth finally appeared and
made herself comfortable in a porch swing
   there she is now viola reported to
sallin  ill run over she had not gone
to the next house earlier because it was
bessie she wished to meet not some other
in the family
red for a million

   i wont stay long floyd she added
 ill hurry so you can get out of exhibition
theyve seen enough of you for one day
  sallin flapped his muffled hands and mut-
tered unintelligibly she couldnt be too
fast to suit him
  it was growing dusk as viola crossed the
lawn bessie saw her coming and fluttered
expectantly she would not of course be
rude enough to inquire but she was just
dying to know what frightful accident had
happened to that poor man nevertheless
bessie appeared surprised when viola spoke
softly over the end of the veranda
   i wonder said viola  if i might use
your phone
  bessie jumped up she wished there was
more light in which to see that gorgeous
hair she stepped forward to where viola
smiling faintly and hesitant stood at the
rail
   surely said bessie  come right in
please she was doubly fortunate-she
would see the titian marvel close at hand
besides hearing probably about the man
   im sorry to trouble you murmured
viola moving to the steps
   no trouble assured bessie keeping
pace with her it was a favor bessie
was scarcely twenty years old and she was
positive that there was a thrill connected
with the newcomers
   i am mrs sallin viola introduced
herself as they met at the top of the steps
 they havent connected our phone yet
we just moved in to-day you know
  bessie tingled she was aware of the eyes
directed at her from other verandas-en-
vious eyes
   im bessie wentworth she returned
and her hand went out as viola took it
she decided that bessie was a lovable little
creature she sensed the eager interest of
the girl but did not hasten to satisfy it
she would let that come about as a matter
of course
  bessie piloted her visitor into the house
   i wouldnt bother you apologized
viola  but the doctor will be here in the
morning and i have to get some things
from the drug store
   the doctor echoed bessie with slight
insinuation that was a lead it ought to
bring the story a glimmer of horrified
sympathy came to her face-sympathy that
conveyed an irrepressible outspoken query
they were at the phone in the hall she
withdrew while viola talked over it but
she could not help hearing the order for
surgical dressings emollient oils and tinc-
tures and oiled silk but that didnt tell
her much she half concluded to put an
innocent question if viola did not volunteer
information
   let me call mother to meet you she
said as viola left the phone it was a sin-
cere effort to be friendly but it was also
a pretext to detain viola im sure she
will- she gave viola no time to answer
 oh mother she called and mother re-
sponded
  viola and the elderly woman exchanged
commonplaces viola was invited to stay
a while she took the opportunity to
accomplish the real object of her visit with-i
out appearing to advertise her affairs
   id love to she said and a sadness
crept into her voice  but i must get back
to mr sallin he -she gestured compas-
sionately lovingly and her eyes blinked-
 he isnt able to do much for himself and
the strain is wearing him out i have to
remain with him
  mrs wentworth was not so backward
as her daughter she was a motherly soul
she could feel the weight of the tragedy
that had so evidently stricken this couple
 how -she was genuinely affected-
 how did it happen
  bessie trembled on tiptoe it had been
a master stroke the summoning of her
mother
   an explosion replied viola without
hesitation  a gasoline explosion
   oh now that the subject was up
bessie poured a question on top of her ejac-
ulation  he must have been fearfully
burned
   terribly viola nodded somberly
then she smiled bravely  but he is
coming through all right his eyes by
some mercy were not seriously injured
   and how- repeated mrs wentworth
after further expression of horror
   a spark from nowhere answered
viola  he was pouring gasoline from a

argosy-allstory weekly
can into the car when- she threw out her
hands
   and his face and hands- prompted
bessie breathlessly
  viola shivered a little  were oh-i
cannot describe it  an air of thankfulness
came to her again  but he wont be so
frightfully disfigured at least we dont
think so he has just undergone a skin-
grafting operation which the doctors say
will make a wonderful difference
   it is dreadful that his face should have
suffered said bessie
   yes viola smiled wanly  yet we
are grateful that it was no worse it would
have been had his cap not been pulled down
and given some protection to his eyes
that explained how sallins hair had not
been scorched off
  viola glanced over at the house where
he sat motionless a bizarre figure with
the white of his bandages showing in the
faint light
   ill have to go she added  it was
good of you to ask me to stay
  she had done well she noted her re-
cital had won their hearts
  mrs wentworth caught her hand  if
there is anything at all that we can do
she offered  dont hesitate my dear
bessie caught violas other hand she
was somewhat ashamed of her morbid in-
terest now that she knew how seriously poor
mr sallin was afflicted
   i wish there was something we could
do she said impulsively  you will let
us know if there is
  violas smile was wistful  its dear of
you to offer she said gently  id love
to have you drop over and talk to me now
and then i wont be able to get away
much-mr sallin feels so helpless if you
will come sit with me sometimes-
  she broke off and a light glimmered in
her eyes a man was coming up the path-
a young man she had not expected to
make such rapid progress to meet him so
soon she assumed that he was frank
denton cashier of the bank that was to
yield a million and she was right she was
departing but bessie restrained her
   oh frank said the girl and he came
forward  i want you to meet mrs sallin
who has just moved in next door her
husband has had a terrible accident this
is frank denton mrs sallin she smiled
prettily  you-youll see him often
here
  acknowledging the introduction viola
laughed quietly understandingly
  denton grinned  as often as possible
he declared
   when i know you both better ill
congratulate you more adequately said
viola  but now i mut run-ive stayed
too long gossiping
  with their friendly words following her
she tripped down the steps and rejoined
sallin
   isnt her hair won-der-ful  bessie
watched her affianced as she asked that
but there was a little pout on her lips
she didnt want him to think it was too
remarkable
  the pout was not lost on denton
   is it he responded guilefully  what
color is it
   dont you try to fool me frank den-
ton proclaimed bessie darkly  i saw
you staring your eyes out didnt you
mother
  mrs wentworth backed away  you
cant get me into trouble you fight it out
with frank
  denton steered bessie toward the swing
and the shadows
   of course i saw it he confessed  but
-pooh its red now if it were golden-
  and with a golden head on his shoulder
he permitted its owner to recount the ca-
lamity from which floyd sallin was recov-
ering
   howd you make out came sallins
muffled accents as viola bent her head on
his
   great theyre nice folks floyd
were over the first jump i met denton
too come on inside and ill unmask you
and tell you about them
v
  queer doings began immediately within
the sallin house
  on that first evening a survey of the
red for a million

upper regions was made by sallin with
daylight odell and taylor went to work
with fine saws that made hardly a sound
cutting out the flooring and joists in the
attic every scrap of lumber that could be
taken with safety was removed
   well need it all said sallin  leave
enough to hold the roof for a couple of
weeks weve got two thousand dollars
paid on this ranch they can use that to
fix it up when we quit
  at intervals throughout the day the work
went on taylor and odell sweated and
swore but they stayed at it they would
be well paid for their labor
  the timbers were cut into lengths of
three and four feet and stacked in the cellar
as he sized up the growing pile sallin re-
marked that they would have to cut into
the second floor too
   hell chief said odell  cant we
fetch in a load of lumber and save all this
work these boobs never would tumble
to what it was for make out youre going
to build a new porch or something
   a good idea mint-good derided
sallin  its likely that wed have a gang
of workmen hammering round here while
im so badly injured im here for quiet
we cant have any noisy work going on
   get on the job mint grinned tay-
lor  being cookie and chambermaid has
made you soft this  put you in trim for
whats to come
   yah said mint with disgust but he
went ahead because he knew that this prep-
aration was essential to the main task
  another incident that day was visible to
the outside it was staged for the benefit
of the neighbors that was the coming of
 dr perthwaite  in the person of sam
heusler
  sam arrived in the forenoon in a luxu-
rious town car he looked the part well
enough
  on the porch with sallin viola rose to
meet the  doctor all three promptly
went into the house
  as he was relieved of his camouflage and
sat down with a cigarette in his mouth to
kill the time that it should take to dress his
injuries sallin warned heusler
   youll have to be careful sam that
none of our bolshevik agents see you in
this town they might follow to find out
where you call
   ill watch out heusler stared at
viola  my god what hair  he exclaimed
in admiration  a woman sure has the
edge when it comes to make-up look at
me- he ran a hand over his round
face and his brows gathered  what
chance have i got of changing my map
that complexion and hair make you some-
body else
  viola laughed reassuringly  youll get
away fast enough sam she said soothing-
ly  floyds going to let you have a day
or two start on us that  give you time to
get under cover
   youll be all right affirmed sallin
 what did you hear from fiorella and his
crew
   i got their daily report heusler pro-
duced it  they seem to be getting next
to the natives
   lets see sallin read the poorly writ-
ten letter he smiled and nodded  thats
good theyre not having much trouble
vi worming a way in these foreigners
that this towns been so good to arent so
pleased as they were a year ago theyre
peeved about the shortening of hours-the
cutting out of overtime that is-thats been
coming about as the plants get back to
normal theyve been spoiled by the fat
pay envelopes they came to know through
the war
  theyre grateful cattle said viola
scornfully  because they cant keep their
faces in the trough until theyre gorged
they listen to any burglar that comes along
talking soviet and the rule of the proleta-
riat
   thats what agreed sallin  but
we havent any reason to kick about that
it helps our game say sam you ought to
see the duke and mint on the job as house-
wreckers they have the place half torn
apart already either of them would trade
jobs with you
   yeh i suppose so heusler looked at
his watch  how long do i have to hang
around here id just as soon not be
   you can go soon sallin was not

argosy-allstory weekly
pleased by heuslers attitude sam wasnt
showing any too much nerve-nothing near-
ly commensurate with his bulk  youll
have to look after everything on the out-
side he said sharply  if theres any
trip-up it  be on your end how about
that load of stuff whens it get here
   to-morrow replied sam uneasily
sallin shouldnt put the burden on him like
that heuslers pudgy hands rolled on a
cigar  there wont be anything go wrong
-outside of here he added
   then -sallin darted a glance at him
- nothing will go wrong anywhere we
are under way-waiting for these boxes
see they get here to-morrow and now
he smiled  youd better jack up fiorella
and de real and kolinsky to open fire on
the moneyed interests tell them not to
lay it on too thick at the start just ooze
it out that if it wasnt for the interests that
lend money the employers the slave drivers
couldnt exist have them remind the
bohunks that its their own money that is
used in this way against them
   you dont want to give them too much
to work on yet asked heusler
   no enough to get em tuned up
we wont be ready for the smash until
about two weeks from now that allows
lots of time to get the yaps into line if
they listen to our dope they ought to be well
primed
  humph heusler grunted weightily
he got up  ill get back to town noth-
ing else you want looked after
   thats all just now sallin frowned
slightly  youre in an awful hurry sam
it was at once a question and a rebuke
   yeh sam grinned wryly  i dont
want to be seen any moren necessary
there was a tinge of malice in violas
comment  wouldnt hurt sam to lend a
hand with a pick and shovel youre too
fat sam
  heusler didnt appreciate the humor
   im too big for that he said quickly
 besides id make a funny looking doctor
with my hands all grubby
   you could wear gloves shrugged
viola her pale eyes roved over him then
went to sallin viola was registering a
doubt about sam-doubt about the wisdom
of having given him a more or less conspic-
uous part  dont take to wearing goggles
and a cap that  make you look like a
stick-up she advised  nobodys going
to notice you much coming in and out of
here
   maybe no said sam he tried to ap-
pear more at ease  that grafting opera-
tion i did on you is a big success chief
he joked  nobody d ever know your
face had been burned off
   you can set up as a specialist when
were done here remarked sallin dryly
 you can chase along now get that load
here early to-morrow well be ready
for it
  viola accompanied heusler to the front
steps as he continued down the walk to
his car she waved to bessie wentworth
who was trimming a rosebush at the side of
her home
  bessie snipped off a dozen of the blooms
and held them up viola smiled acceptance
and they went to meet each other
   the doctor gave you good news to-
day queried bessie anxiously she was
intensely sorry for the sweet red headed
woman who bore her tragedy so bravely
  splendid returned viola he is
more optimistic than ever and his promise
of complete success for the operation has
cheered mr sallin greatly so much so
in fact she laughed delightedly  that
mr sallin wants me to invite some folks to
visit us youd understand how wonderful
that is if you knew how despairing and con-
sequently nervous he has been
  oh im so glad enthused bessie
it must be- oh
  she broke off with the exclamation as
viola twined one of the roses into her hair
the effect was almost startling so vivid did
the white blossom become on that billowing
background of red
  viola grimaced in deprecation  it is
awful she remarked
  awful bessie was aghast its
adorable i wish i didnt have this old
blond hair she sighed  anybody can be
a blond
   and i -viola was amused- often
think of bleaching out this mop she
pushed it back on her forehead and bessie
red for a million

satisfied another point of her curiosity-as
viola hoped he would bessies glance
went keenly to the roots of the flaming
crown she had had just a suspicion-
just a doubt that this was not all natures
own glory
  but that suspicion was dispelled violas
hair was red clear down to the scalp there
was no telltale hint of another shade close
to the roots on the newest growth to be-
tray that it had been dyed viola took
pains to insure that there was none by
daily applications of henna for she knew
that without constant attention that reveal-
ing margin would appear within a very few
days
  for several minutes they bandied their
mutual envy the red head favoring the gol-
den the golden favoring the red then
viola apparently was struck by a thought
   perhaps youd take pity on us since
mr sallin is feeling so much better and
run over this evening she proposed  you
can bring mr denton it wont be very
exciting of course but-although he wont
be able to join in our chatter im sure that
just having company will do mr sallin a
world of good
   why yes certainly it pleased bes-
sie to be of even such small service
 frank will be here well come over after
dinner
   its sweet of you said viola gratefully
 thanks ever so much for the roses-
she pressed them to her face to hide the
twinkle in her eyes bessie was such a
dear simple little thing it seemed a shame
to make use of her  well look for
you-
   after dinner said bessie and she re-
turned to her rose trimming while viola
went in to report to sallin on the further-
ance of her campaign to bring the cashier
of the bank of norford within reaching
distance
  the visit of bessie wentworth and frank
denton to the sallin house that evening was
without special significance except that it
paved the way for viola later on to obtain
an invitation to look over the interior of a
modern bank vault she led up to that by
displaying an amazing ignorance of bank-
ing and awe regarding those who engaged
in it
   doesnt it scare you to have the money
of so many people in your safekeeping
she asked denton  i wouldnt sleep nights
for fear burglars were carrying away the
millions
  bessie joined in dentons laughter as
the affianced of a bank employee she had
a contact knowledge of the internal work-
ings
   if you examined the box we keep it in
said denton lightly  you wouldnt be
afraid
   but millions repeated viola perched
as usual on the arm of sallins chair she
snuggled her head closer to his  men go
to extremes for trifling sums what
wouldnt they dare to get at millions i
shouldnt imagine that any box would be
strong enough to keep it safely
   anyway supplied bessie with a su-
perior smile  there arent millions in the
bank are there frank
   not generally he chuckled  you
see mrs sallin we have to use the deposits
to earn money-lend it out-so that we can
pay interest and dividends
  oh viola brightened as though she
had been let in on an extraordinary fact
 i never thought of that of course it
would be absurd to suppose that you kept it
all there still the vaults must be tre-
mendously strong
  it was bessie who issued the invitation
 well go over some day and frank will
show you through it is truly remarkable
the big vault with its door so thick -she
measured in exaggeration with her hands-
 and its walls-um youll let mrs sallin
peek wont you frank
   surely denton indorsed the invita-
tion  drop in any day and ill show you
over but youll be disappointed its just
a great big safe-nothing more
  the red head nodded vivaciously
 thats how it seems to you said viola
but to me-well and dont you forget
that you promised ill be in in a day or
two-soon because i want to open an ac-
count
  with a trace of excitement she spoke
close to sallins ear relating that she was

argosy-allstory weekly
to be permitted to inspect the insides of the
bank he poor chap couldnt engage in
the conversation on account of his covered
ears but it did not detract from the pathos
of the picture that he had to sit practically
out of touch with the company except for
violas constant caress
  in her fondness for her new friend bessie
imparted an item of information which in
conjunction with his acquaintanceship with
sallin was to have a result upon denton
   another bank wants frank to leave the
norford she told proudly  hes only
cashier over here hed be vice president
if hed go to the phcenix
   congratulations exclaimed viola she
patted bessies shoulder  youll be the
wife of a bank president before hes
through
   i dont care what he is confessed bes-
sie with a flirt of her head  so long as
he- she laughed and in the darkness
extended a hand to denton which he held
   and are you going to change mr den-
ton asked viola  it would be quite a
step up would it not
   yes-but- denton hesitated  it
would he added finally with gathering
brows  but i dont know the phcenix
you see might expect certain things-that
certain accounts would go along with me
from the norford they havent said so
not outright but that is what theyd look
for
  again bessie evidenced her pride in him
 frank has done a lot to keep the norford
in front she declared  its the oldest
bank and since the others came its had to
fight for business it is a savings bank
you know mrs sallin but the others also
handle savings franks ideas have kept it
ahead but for him it wouldnt have all
the mill workers accounts for one thing
 bessie thinks the institution would col-
lapse if i wasnt there laughed denton
 itd go along just the same bessie
plainly bessie was skeptical
   i dont understand said viola she
maintained her role of ignorance  whats
the difference between a savings bank and
any other
   a savings bank pays interest on all de-
posits explained denton  others pay
only on sums ranging upward from a thou-
sand dollars and their rate is not so high
that is on account of checking and other
privileges they give which do not go with
a savings account
   thats it said viola vaguely she
came back to bessies remark  and you
dont think youll leave to go to this other
bank
   i dont know said denton again  it
is tempting because it will be a long time be-
fore further promotion offers in the norford
not until some one dies as happened at the
phoenix ill have to talk with them some
more before i decide
   i think you ought to take it said
bessie suddenly inconsistently in accord
with her womans license
   and let the norford go to smash he
grinned
   you said it wouldnt
   you said it would
    i didnt
   didnt she mrs sallin denton ap-
pealed for support
   cant get me into any quarrel laughed
viola
  bessie also appealed to her  he should
take it
   why demanded denton
   oh because retorted bessie without
logic  dont you want to be more than a
mere cashier id rather be a mrs vice
president
   it seems to me gurgled viola  that
youre doomed to be vice president of this
other bank mr denton
vi
  the load of stuff which sallin had ad-
jured heusler to hurry conformed to the
general scheme-with the exception of
violas hair-in that it was nothing to at-
tract unusual attention on the face of it
it was furniture-all furniture but in it
were seven boxes which did not contain
anything resembling furniture
  a few boxes however when some one is
moving mean nothing they might hold
books or the accumulation of odds and ends
that belong to every household
  the men on the truck who carried the
red for a million

boxes into the house commented on their
weight but had no suspicion of what they
contained in line with his determination
to keep down to the limit the number of
participants in this his greatest effort sallin
let the trucking be done by a regular con-
cern aside from the fact that it cut down
the possibility of capture-the fewer who
had knowledge of what was toward the less
the risk-the name of the company em-
blazoned on the truck was in itself a dis-
arming sign of legitimacy
  the heavy boxes moreover were of dif-
ferent sizes uniformity might have drawn
an inquisitive eye
  the various pieces of furniture in the
load were distributed in their proper places
through the house the boxes were left in
the lower hall
  immediately the truckmen had departed
taylor and odell proceeded to open the
boxes sallin who during the unloading
had remained on the veranda removed his
bandages and superintended this was
equipment that he had had ready for long
in readiness for the chance when it should
come into play and he wanted to see that it
was correct
   the hose is in these five he pointed
them out  that one has the fans and
drills this has the tanks once we get
the hose hooked up the labor will be done
   but until then grumbled taylor  all
we have to do is work how about getting
a couple of wops to do that and bumping
them on the skull when its done
   you have an idea sometimes favored
odell  im for that
   and ideas often are disastrously expen-
sive voiced sallin  get it into your
heads now that this job has to be kept
tight among ourselves pry these boxes
apart and ill help you get the stuff down-
stairs
  viola came in as taylor slid a chisel
beneath the metal binding strap on the first
of the boxes
   how long will it take to make the con-
nection floyd she asked  how far to
dig
  sallin produced a map of the street copied
from that on file in the department of pub-
lic works
   we have twenty-four feet to go he
said  we can make it in four days we
wont rush
  viola studied the map
   what if theres a cave-in
   then the whole works goes blooey an-
swered sallin grimly  and we travel fast
his eyes glinted on her  youre not turn-
ing pessimist vi he added half irritably
 let heusler do the moaning there wont
be any cave-in well take our time to
avoid that
   thats what i meant said viola
 that it would be better to lose a day
than to take a chance of the ground giving
way
  taylor and odell ripped away the boards
in the box were six lengths of stout hose
such as a fire engine uses for emergency
pumping each was four feet long and was
fitted with union clamps so that all could be
quickly joined together
  four more of the boxes produced similar
freight a powerful valve was installed in
one piece of hose
  the sixth box uncovered two electric
drills with an abundance of points a couple
of picks and shovels and crowbars and a
nozzle for the hose the latter also was
equipped with a controlling valve
  from the other case came four cylindri-
cal tanks
   theres more of the gas to come ex-
plained sallin
  odells eyes livened he ran his hands
caressingly over the tanks
   theyre the boys he gloated  if
only we didnt have to go mining before we
can use them
   aw heres the babies contented tay-
lor fingering the drills  we got to have
these in action before your blamed torch is
any use
   and without the torch your diamond
points wouldnt be worth a dime jeered
odell he was of the oxy-acetylene school
while taylor pinned his faith to the ability
of a tempered steel bit to go through any
plate that ever was built  your drillsd
flatten like cheese on what were going up
against duke
   might take longer with them admitted
taylor grudgingly  but if i have to i

argosy-allstory weekly
can go through the whole job you can
only go halfway-and the second half at
that
   ill show you snorted odell he
touched the weighty cylinders again with
loving hands-the two larger that held the
hydrogen and the pair half the size that
contained the oxygen  wait till we get
going-
   meantime well get going into the cel-
lar interrupted sallin  were working-
not debating theres a matter of digging
leads the program
  they fell to work and soon the myste-
rious and burglarious assortment was down-
stairs beside the pile of lumber that had
been flooring and walls in the upper part of
the house
  guided by the map sallin marked off a
place on the cellar wall at the front of the
dwelling the bank was forty feet from the
rear wall they were heading in the oppo-
site direction from that
   drive straight in said sallin  and
emphatically  dont forget to shore up
every inch as you go if there isnt enough
lumber here now well take the rest of the
house apart
   remember we have to go under the
sidewalk safety first if we dont make
it solid all the way were done
  odell picked daintily at the mortar in the
wall with a crowbar
   id let you go at it with that tooth-
pick hooted taylor  if i wasnt in a
hurry myself to get to hell out of here
come give us a help with this wire and see
how the drills eat that up
  they made the connection and fifteen
minutes later taylor was squatting over a
drill thrust against the wall and biting
through it
  after the removal of one stone the task
moved more briskly the hole permitted
leverage with the crowbar to be exerted on
the other masonry soon the aperture ap-
proximated a yard square
  while his men started to run a shaft
toward the street sallin resumed his
bandages on face and hands and with
viola sat out again on the veranda it
was violas duty to look out for possible
callers and to listen with sharp ears for
any sound of the work going on under-
ground it was not likely that they would
but the bur rowers might prove too ambi-
tious and so sacrifice silence to progress
vii
  one cog in the sallin machine slipped
and for the moment threatened to strip all
the gears it was that which sallin had
come to look upon as weak-the cog in
which sam heusler was the king-pin
  the slip-up was sams fault in his in-
creasing nervousness at being in what he
considered too much of the limelight he
imparted information to fiorella de real
and kolinsky which he should have saved
he was premature in relaying instructions
to them
  the upshot was that on the fifth day
of sallins sojourn in the town of nor-
ford the presence of the three alleged radical
organizers became noticeable worst of all
their endeavors won the interest of the bank
most involved that was because heusler
gave his agents too great latitude in their
agitation against the moneyed institutions
  from what could be gathered in a hasty
investigation the banks appeared to be the
principal target and on account of the
ground on which the seed of discontent
was being sown the bank of norford
found itself especially concerned this
was because of the large number of foreign-
born mill workers on its books
  withdrawals of their balances by several
score of that class of depositors first caused
frank denton to wonder he had a par-
ticular interest in these depositors for he
had been instrumental in obtaining their
patronage on his suggestion the bank had
sent representatives among them when they
were piling up high war wages and had
convinced them of the benefits of opening
accounts and the greater security at the
mills on pay days it had conducted a branch
and won over many who distrusted banks
but were becoming fearful about the ever
fattening stocking in the bottom of a trunk
at home or the growing bulge in the mat-
tress
  thus the bank of norford had stolen a
march on its competitors and had brought
red for a million

into its keeping many thousands of dollars
which were being hoarded against the time
when their owners should return to their
native lands once having made friends
among these people its patronage from
them had grown until at the period of sal-
lins advent it carried on its books nearly
fifteen hundred of this class with deposits
aggregating two million and a quarter
  the abrupt closing out of a number of
these accounts puzzled denton he had a
nodding acquaintance with the workers be-
cause he had cultivated them and he had
the bankers memory for names and faces
when a dozen arrived in a group to with-
draw their funds therefore he talked with
them
  his assumption was that they were about
to leave for the country which they still
regarded as home and he inquired when
they were to sail they shrugged said
 no goin or something like that and
evaded further questioning
  when others followed rapidly on their
heels to close out their accounts he sat
up and took wide eyed notice they gave
him just as little information as the earlier
comers-they were not leaving norford
but they wanted their money
  denton put the situation up to the presi-
dent having explained that almost three-
score accounts had been closed within two
days he proposed that steps be taken to
learn the reason
   we ought to send a couple of scouts
among them he suggested  theres
something underhand going on i- he
paused on the thought and his face clouded
  his resignation was on the desk of the
president effective in thirty days he had
accepted the vice presidency of the phoenix
bank and he paused on the thought be-
cause of a sudden suspicion that the phoenix
might have a hand in the affair
  denton was aware that much of the con-
fidence these foreigners had in the bank
of norford was due to confidence in himself
who had won them over in the beginning
was it not possible that the phcenix was
spreading the w-ord that he was going over
to it and capitalizing his popularity to wean
depositors from the norford
  h h trainor the president looked
 at him quizzically he read dentons
thought
   youre going away from us frank he
said quietly
  denton flushed angrily
   but that can have nothing to do with
it he declared  i dont believe-i cant
believe-that the phcenix would play a trick
like this i dont believe they could get
away with it if they did we-the norford
always have treated these people right we
have helped them in every way possible-
transferred money to their native countries
at the most advantageous rates of exchange
protected their relatives and friends coming
to this country by putting them into the
hands of reputable agents during the jour-
ney no it cant be the phoenix and
yet-
  he stopped again doubtfully what
other explanation could there be
  trainor refused to be perturbed
   youre fidgety frank he smiled
 youve been imagining things since the
phoenix started to take you away from us
now you think youve discovered something
to hang your fidgets on a few withdraw-
als cant make any impression that they
occurred in a group is only coincidence
   that may be so argued denton
 but lets see if we can locate a reason
call in jenkins to hunt out the source i
know these people mr trainor and they
know me but i could get nothing definite
from them-only that they wanted their
cash
   well call jenkins if you want to
granted trainor good naturedly  he has
our retainer and we might as well use him
once in a while have him come over
frank to look for your mares nest he
laughed
  so jenkins head of an agency that op-
erated for banks in the metropolitan dis-
trict was summoned to norford he came
next day and by then the president of the
bank of norford was beginning to sit up
too another dozen of the mill workers had
withdrawn their accounts
  sitting in trainors office the detective
heard denton out the cashier now did not
hesitate to voice his suspicion that the
phcenix bank was at the bottom of it

argosy-allstory weekly
   still he added to be fair  i cant
find that the cash being taken from us is
going to the phoenix it seems to be going
to the ancient and easily pilfered stocking
bank
   any sign of con artists in town asked
jenkins a mild mannered little man of
cheerful mien  with a good line of gold
mine or oil stock
   not that we have heard replied
trainor  though that would offer a fair-
ly reasonable explanation
   it isnt it negatived denton  these
people dont buy stock now and then one
falls for a con game but they dont fall in
bunches no theres some sort of propa-
ganda going on and were feeling the brunt
of it because we have more of the foreign-
ers money than the other banks
  jenkinss expression was bland but his
mild eyes focused on trainor he put an
indirect question
   i cant figure where any one would
gain by knocking your bank he remarked
 youre sound enough-yes it could not
affect your stability even though there
were wholesale withdrawals
   good lord no-certainly not puffed
trainor not if every nickel was taken
out if we liquidated to-morrow wed show
a tidy surplus for distribution nobody
could be crazy enough to attempt to injure
our credit by pulling out a few thousands
 have the examiners been in lately
trainor laughed at that because he knew
jenkins had the query come from any
one else on top of what he had just said
he might have resented it he understood
that jenkins did not dispute his statement
but was simply completing a thought jen-
kins always completed his thoughts
   they were here a month ago-less than
that said trainor  if you find theres
a conspiracy against us he went on
thoughtfully  well have them in again to
demonstrate that were o k
   if theres a conspiracy said jenkins
shrewdly  you would only hurt yourself
by having the examiners back so soon
those on the outside would read it as con-
firmation that something was wrong
   umph thats so trainor showed
a trace of worry he began to see that
  there might be something serious going on
 go ahead then jenkins youll have to
go after it in your own way for im blessed
if i can offer any suggestion of what to
look for it seems like an idiotic proposi-
tion to be wasting time on
   if we can turn up anything it will be
time well spent said denton  if there
is nothing to turn up-well we played on
the safe side
  sallins judgment in scraping acquaint-
ance with frank denton was justified that
night
  bessie wentworth was over chatting with
viola as she had fallen into the habit of
doing when denton arrived he joined
them
  bessie again proved an unconscious ally
she remarked on dentons preoccupation
   you look worried frank she said
 you dont want to leave the bank she
challenged
   it isnt that denton tried to shake
off his perplexity
   then what is it she insisted den-
ton couldnt be allowed to have any se-
crets
  he saw no objection to mentioning the
puzzling circumstance before the sallins
   it isnt anything serious he said
 only-we cant make out why so many
of the mill workers are closing out their
accounts nearly a hundred have done so
in the last two days
   is that all  bessie could not see the
matter as of much moment  that cant
ruin the bank
  viola bit her lip and her arm tightened
warningly on sallins shoulder she hoped
that he could hear the bandages had been
reduced to a bare covering over his ears
she pinched him to pay heed
   no-but- denton pursed his lips
and gestured  no he repeated  but it
strikes us as so queer that weve put de-
tectives to work to discover the reason
   viola felt sallin start
   it would make a big cut in the banks
business explained denton to viola  if
all these foreigners drew out they have
over two millions on deposit
  viola smothered a quickening of her
                          	a
red for a million

breath she knew that this was not on the
schedule
   oh she said rather inanely vaguely
to intimate that she in a distant manner
appreciated the situation  but what if
the detectives learn anything what can
you do can you make these people leave
their money in the bank
   not if they dont want to laughed
denton  if we could show a conspiracy
however and that is what it seems like
we could prosecute and restore the confi-
dence in us that evidently is being under-
mined
   i see said viola slowly
  sallin stirred lifting a shrouded hand
she bent her ear to his lips and he mut-
tered through the bandaging
  she smiled apologetically on bessie and
denton
   im going to send you folks home she
said with a laugh  mr sallin is tired and
wants to go indoors you dont mind and
please -she was sweetly pleading- do
not let my sending you away keep you from
coming again you wont promise
  they promised and retired to the greater
intimacy of the swing at bessies house
denton was not displeased over that
neither was bessie really although she
did not begrudge the time she spent in
violas company viola had been through
such a trial and had borne it so coura-
geously
  in the privacy of the house with his
mock dressings removed sallin swore
whole-heartedly his fists clenched and his
face was hard
   damn that fool heusler he wound
up  hes let these rats get away from
him but by heaven hes got to hold
them-repair the damage theyve done
or -his lips pulled coldly thin- or sam
heusler  wonder whats happened to him
-if hes able to wonder in the here-
after
  viola let him alone as he raged she felt
as he did but wisely she maintained si-
lence all that could be done to rectify
this premature development was as sallin
had said to make heusler put a check-rein
on de real fiorella and kolinsky
  heusler would come in the morning she
      a
pictured the lashing sallin would give him
she could not conceive that that lashing
of heusler was to cause the cog that already
had slipped to go farther out of mesh
viii
  heusler sulked when sallin lit into him
at the end of the tirade he attempted to
defend himself to criticize and shift the
fault to sallin himself
   you cant blame me for what these guys
do he asserted with fair vehemence for
he was sore  its a crazy stunt having
them there anyhow how dyou expect
them to do anvthing but mess things up
what-
   i expect you to make them unmess
things interjected sallin icily  youll
get in touch with them-quick-now i
dont care what chances you run get to
them and hold them down its up to you
sam
  under his gaze heusler squirmed he
moistened his fat lips and opened them to
speak
   sallins voice incisive threatening in its
quiet checked him
   there are no two ways about it sam
you handle your end of the job right or
you quit and -he smiled sourly-if
you quit it will cost you a hundred thou-
sand dollars i let you in on this because
it was one of your prospects ill let you
out-fast without a nickel divvy
   what can i do mumbled heusler
he didnt take to the notion of being
ditched now that the big job was well
under way  you told me not to be seen
in town here by de real or the others
how can i get to them now ill have to
wait till they can come to me in new
york and-
   youll chase them up as soon as you
leave here ordered sallin  tell them to
soft pedal these hunkies that are with-
drawing their cash if that isnt done at
once everything  be shot to pieces his
narrowing eyes increased heuslers discom-
fort  that sam he purred in addi-
tion  would be unfortunate for you
  heusler squeezed his cigar flat between
his fingers and glowered at the remnant

argosy-allstory weekly
   and youd better hustle advised sal-
lin  get to your men and set them right
before the detectives working for the bank
get a line on them if they beat you to it
the cops will make you sam and -his
face froze again- that also would mean
that wed be through
   all right said heusler there was
nothingelse to say there was nothing to
be gained by arguing with sallin sallin
had the whip hand inasmuch as he could
discard heusler and have some one else
carry on the outside work he switched
the subject to safer channels
   how are you making out down below
he jerked a thumb toward the cellar
   were making out all right sallin
spoke crisply  if you dont ball us up
again i want the truck to come through
here to-morrow at one oclock jake will
drive it himself he knows what he has
to do and have him bring his owners
license so that he can put the truck up as
bail if he gets pinched understand
   yes
   make sure that jake does
  heusler acknowledged with a grunt  ill
go now and bawl out de real and the
other birds he said without enthusiasm
 they got to lay off huh
   dont go at them too strong revised
sallin  theyre hard guys sam and
he gave them credit  we have to admit
that theyre good workers trouble is that
theyve got the hunkies going too soon you
neednt tell them that the fly cops are on
the job might scare them but tell them
to show their control is right by holding the
mob in check for a few days
  for the second time however sam heus-
ler neglected to carry out instructions to the
letter as he had overstepped in giving too
much material to the three man sent among
the mill workers as agitators he erred again
by being too liberal-with abuse
  he did not meet the disturbers in nor-
ford but he did get into communication
with them before leaving for new york
that was as far as he was willing to go
despite sallins threat he refused to be seen
with them he got de real on the phone
finally and had him come on to the city
   and before you start he snapped
 tell fiorella and kolinsky to lay off until
they see you again i want them to crawl
into a hole and stay there
  his talk face to face with de real was
all to the point the spaniards eyes glint-
ed several times as he listened and his sal-
low face wrinkled but he held his tongue
he wanted to understand this deal more
before he quarreled with the man who ap-
peared to be running it-with heusler he
did not believe heusler was the head he
wanted to know exactly who was
   so he took his call-down suavely
although it had been rough enough in spots
to make his fingers itch toward a knife
sheathed lengthwise along his belt  they
are taking their money from the bank too
soon he spoke with quiet precision of
language  we are to make them stop
i comprehend
   then see that fiorella and kolinsky
comprehend said heusler meanly it was
a new experience browbeating a man of this
type a dangerous man and sam enjoyed it
he remembered some of the things sallin
had said to him and adapted them
  de reals teeth showed in a smile  i
shall remember he said smoothly and he
meant it-two ways
  on the way back to norford he smiled
often over the situation some day he
might have the pleasure of inserting his
knife capably between sam heuslers ribs
for the words that had been spoken mean-
while he could shrug-and wait also he
could assuage his injured feelings to some
extent by pouring upon fiorella and kolin-
sky the flood of heuslers vituperation with
embellishments
  fiorella exploded when he heard it
   lets stick him up for the rest of our
dough an quit the big bum he advo-
cated  we can-
  de real quietly negatived that
   its fanny business he said meaning-
fully his slim fingers strayed along his
belt  heusler does not serve himself he
works for-you know-the big chief when
it is done -his eyes shone craftily- we
might make heusler-pay more yes
   we can cut in now began fiorella
but de real shook his head
red for a million

   it is not well to cut in on him unless
he invites by  him  he referred to sal-
lin and knowing of sallin fiorella took
back his proposal
  kolinsky backed de reals course his
wide mouth gaped twistedly
   heusler  be easy he contributed
 what they doing real
  de real answered with his leisurely ex-
pressive shrug
   after a while we shall know but
this i learned from heusler he comes to
this town we shall discover where he
goes
ix
  sallin crept from the tunnel back into
the cellar of the house that much was
done-and well done he looked upon it
with complete satisfaction taylor and
odell had been careful their job would
stand
  roughly the shaft was three feet square
above it was a good four feet of solid
ground there would be no severe strain
upon that not even at the outermost end
where the shaft projected for a yard or so
beyond the curbing even there no appreci-
able load would pass nothing heavier than
an automobile which was not sufficient to
break into the underground excavation
foot by foot it had been shored up with the
lumber taken from the upper floors and
already most of the earth had been disposed
of through the drain in the cellar the grat-
ing of which had been removed
  although an eighteen-inch electric fan
drove a current into the tunnel sallin came
out sweating
   good work he said approvingly  a
couple of hours and youll be through boil-
ing in there
   wish it was headed the other way
regretted odell with a glance in the direc-
tion of the bank  look at those hands 
-he held them out raw and callousing
from the plying of pick and shovel-
 damned good thing theres no fine work
to do
   it  be well paid labor returned sal-
lin  well run the hose in now
  they fell to and linked up the hose a
task made simple by the adjusted and close
fitting junctions the section containing
the valve was taken into the tunnel sepa-
rately the hooked-up length was pushed
in so that it extended from the cellar to
the small chamber with which the tunnel
terminated
  through the chamber ran the water main
but for its presence on this side of the street
sallin never could have attempted to exe-
cute in norford what was to be his great-
est triumph here was one of the details
for which he had been compelled to look
before he could build it represented an-
other of the essentials to success exact
knowledge of which always had character-
ized his operations he never took a step
without knowing just what was in front
  the rust scales on the water main were
broken by a circle that cut into the pipe
itself but not too deep for safety this
was a delicate part should the pipe give
way before they were ready their plan
would be frustrated they never could
manage to plug the break not only would
they be washed out but the break must
soon be discovered when the flow of water
loosened at houses farther along the main
  this was a stage at which they had to
go slowly until conditions were created to
their advantage then they would have
to work with greatest speed for they could
not know how long a time would be given
them
  sallin crowded into the tunnel taylor
and odell were in the chamber cramped
but with room enough to work there was
not space enough for sallin
   you have everything handy he asked
tensely
  taylor and odell swung the portable
electric lamps with which they lighted the
place odell looked to the connections of
the torch with the oxy-acetylene tanks
that was his chief concern and would come
into service first taylor saw to it that a
pipe threader cans of packing and red lead
and strips of thick canvas to be used as
binding on the joint were within reach
    all set chief they reported
  sallin looked at his watch  its twelve
thirty he said  if we run on schedule
youll begin to tie that hose up to the main
a few minutes after one oclock you dont

argosy-allstory weekly
have to stay in here until then get out
where theres some air ill come down and
pass the word when to stand by-when
jake appears viola will let us know when
he pulls his stunt it  be go after that
upstairs sallin sat beside viola who
watched from a window commanding the
street she bent her head against his
   what happens floyd if theres a flood
we cant control
  there was recklessness in sallins laugh
but also confidence
   we get up and run vi he answered
fliply  the farther away we are when
they locate it the better for our health
   youll have time to cover up your
face concern clouded violas counte-
nance
   i wont take time said sallin  ill
want to see where im going his tone
harshened  heusler should be here with
the car to get you away sam has a yellow
streak hes waiting till the show is over
before he comes along hes looking after
his own fat hide
  violas head rubbed back and forth on
his
   i wouldnt go anyhow without you
well simply walk out quietly if things
break bad you go first-ill catch up on
you round the corner the duke and mint
will take their chances
   yes theyre game otherwise they
wouldnt be in that hole down below
good girl vi he squeezed her  we
wont have to go though weve waited
too long for this look out now -he
shoved her gently to the window- so we
wont miss jake hell give us a bray of his
siren but-
  the shrill cry of a motor horn sounded
violas teeth bit into her lips she pressed
close to the window but was careful to re-
main out of sight behind the curtain
sallin jumped up
   the truck
   yes  whispered viola  coming 
  sallin bolted downstairs
    in he called
  taylor and odell scrambled into the tun-
nel at the cellar end of it sallin squatted
watching the stairs for viola to bring the
word that jake had done his work
  breathlessly viola saw the truck pass the
house it was moving about ten miles
an hour not fast enough to demand more
than a passing glance but still fast enough
to accomplish its object after that one
blast the siren had remained silent hav-
ing signaled his arrival jake knew that
more and unnecessary noise on that quiet
street probably would attract onlookers to
what he was about to do although it
would appear to be an accident he did not
desire witnesses
  approaching the corner past the sallin
house jake glanced sharply about him
back of him along the street two women
were walking in the same direction as he
was going ahead of him were a few other
pedestrians but they were not facing him
  making to round the corner he stepped
on the gas the truck picked up as he
threw over the steering wheel he took the
corner short lumbered over the sidewalk
and struck a fire hydrant
  under the impact of the t-beam guard on
the front of the truck the cast iron hydrant
shattered as the truck lurched back into
the street a geyser shot into the air
  stopping the truck jake jumped down
and stared with dismay at the damage he
had done then like a good citizen he de-
cided to call for help he made his siren
blare
  people tumbled from their homes to stare
helplessly at the torrent of water spouting
from the wrecked hydrant
  hell said jake at large letting up
on the siren  what you know about
that
  women and children gathered and men
home to lunch but no one did anything
until a policeman appeared in response to
the shrilling horn he took one look and
ran on into the nearest house to phone for
the water bureaus emergency wagon
  jake was quick to grasp his opportunity
while all were absorbed in the shooting
water while the policeman was absent jake
went under his truck which was lying at
right angles across the street with a
wrench taken from his pocket he loosened a
bolt in the steering gear he was out from
under the car before the policeman reap-
peared
red for a million

  jake was looking ruefully at the machine
and scrubbing his chin when the policeman
came over and demanded what was the
trouble
   she just ran crazy replied jake
 steering gear out of business i guess
  he reached up and jiggled the wheel it
moved with wide play that did not affect the
wheels
  the policeman nodded understandingly
 how fast were you going
   bout six-eight miles you see how
quick i stopped he had had his brakes
specially lined to insure stopping in a short
distance
  the policeman did not question the ex-
planation but told jake to stick around
because hed have to go to the station house
to make a statement
   ill get the truck moved out into the
street said jake and had another driver
who had come up tow the truck to the curb
  meanwhile the emergency wagon arrived
its crew paused only to glimpse the flood
then ran through it up past sallins house
  from the sidewalk viola observed them
pull up two blocks away that was where
the pipe serving this street and others
branched from the principal water main
as the repair crew raised the manhole cover
she turned to watch the spouting hydrant
the instant the flow dwindled there indi-
cating that the water had been shut off she
hurried into the house
  from the cellar steps she called to sallin
he relayed the information into the tunnel
  in odells hands the oxy-acetylene torch
flared the searing flame ate through the
water pipe following the circle already
marked out
  a minute and the bit of iron was cut
away water poured through the hole but
it was only the dregs and did not interfere
with the threading of the tap and the in-
sertion of the hose
  the packing and lead were slammed into
place the strips of canvas bound fast about
the joint a strong clamp was set about
the brass end of the hose and screwed to
the main
  an hour before the hydrant could be re-
placed sallin had the water pressure with
which he purposed driving silently and with
a minimum of labor into the bank from
which he was to take a million-a million
that he first had to cause to be placed there
x
  to viola fell the duty of prying from
bessie wentworth and frank denton in-
formation about the progress of jenkinss
investigation into the withdrawals from the
bank of norford she did that cleverly
without arousing suspicion
  bessie was ready clay it was from her
that viola learned the name of the detec-
tive a point gained in an inconsequential
way the day after denton mentioned jen-
kinss presence viola knew when not to
appear to be seeking information
  denton was but slightly less communica-
tive when the situation began to show im-
provement he had no reason in the world
for supposing that viola had an ulterior
motive she never manifested any great
interest but she fashioned her questions
adroitly when the subject came up hav-
ing told her along with bessie when the
affair developed denton saw no harm in
letting her know what was being unearthed
   the day after jenkins took up the thread
a few more accounts were closed on the
succeeding day however the movement vir-
tually ceased
  trainor the president then smiled an
 i told you so and his own misgiving
allayed rallied denton as being scary
jenkins so far had been unable to pin the
sudden shyness of the depositors on any
fixed cause the return to normal was
ascribable only to the promptings of de
real fiorella and kolinsky who persuad-
ed their dupes that the time to smash this
group of capitalists had not arrived
  on the fourth day of jenkinss inquiry
viola joined bessie and denton soon after
the latters appearance at the wentworth
house she had to keep in close contact to
find out whether the activities of the three
agitators continued to escape detection
   it was apparent to her at once that den-
ton was divided between pleasure and
doubt bessie also noticed his mingled
feelings and it was she who broached the
subject

argosy-allstory weekly
   you look as though some one had
stroked you the right way frank she com-
mented  and then some one had stroked
you the wrong way your depositors arent
running away from you again
   no denton half frowned half smiled
 we have the same number that we had
this morning-two more in fact
   youve started then to make up the
loss that alarmed you a few days ago
interposed viola conversationally
   well yes but- denton hesitated
   but what commanded bessie
   my alarm was justified to-day it was
my turn to  told you so 
   why bessie advanced the query while
viola held her breath
   jenkins turned up something said
denton
   jenkins viola cocked her red head
and looked interrogatively seemingly un-
able to place the name
   the detective explained bessie
 what was it frank was the phoenix
bank the instigator
   im glad to say it was not and sorry
too he laughed  because if it were we
would have something tangible on which to
base a prosecution as it is he gestured
 well have to let things run along-un-
less we can get something on these men
and put them in jail or drive them out of
town
  viola turned her face into the shadows
she quivered waiting for bessie to seek fur-
ther enlightenment
  bessie did  what men youre talk-
ing in riddles frank if youve found the
men who were scaring off the depositors
why cant you prosecute them
   because there is no evidence of con-
spiracy they are simply radical agitators
who are trying to stir up the mill workers
with soviet talk and down-with-capital
stuff we felt the effects of their spell-
binding because we have practically all the
savings accounts from among the foreign
element
  viola spoke tentatively as one groping
for understanding
   if they have been trying to destroy
your business why cant you have them
arrested
   thats the difficulty repiied denton
 they have not been trying directly to de-
stroy our business all they have done is
to indulge the right of free speech there
is no law forbidding verbal attack on what
they call capitalism if as a result of their
talk some persons are influenced to think
they can injure capital by such measures as
withdrawing their cash from a bank the
agitator cannot be held responsible in law
you see what i mean
   partly-i think so smiled viola den-
ton was an obliging and helpful chap since
he had expounded for her benefit there was
no danger in asking him to go on  then
you can only watch them until they some-
how break the law
   theres where were rather helpless
admitted denton  theyre careful usual-
ly to stay within the law that breed
knows its game
   you can watch them though per-
sisted viola  and knowing what they are
about forestall them do they know that
you have discovered them
   not if jenkins could help it they
dont grinned denton  there are only
two of them so far as he has learned he
has them shadowed day and night an
italian and a spaniard he says they are
hes looking up their records
  viola caught at the fact that kolinsky
had been overlooked the most dangerous
of the trio because of his slavic origin which
was similar to that of the bulk of the people
he was working among and because of his
recent visit to russia and claimed comrade-
ship with the bolshevik chieftain there
   it isnt fair that you cant do anything
to stop them protested bessie  theyll
persuade more of the workers-
   i dont think so said denton  the
little flurry of withdrawals that brought the
affair to our notice probably weeded out
both the more timorous and the more radi-
cal as a general rule these people are sat-
isfied he declared in his ignorance
 theyve been well treated in this town-
in this country-and so far as the bank
is concerned their relations with it have in-
creased their confidence in it that is dem-
onstrated by the many who have become
depositors since we got the first of them
red for a million

   the mystery is all cleared up in that
case said bessie  now as mrs sallin
just said all you have to do is keep an eye
on the-the bolsheviks and checkmate
them
   uh-huh denton was on the whole
pleased with the way matters had turned
out he had been cleared of the imputation
that he was an alarmist his perspicacity
had given the bank a weapon with which
to combat further possible inroads by re-
vealing the agitators and the point at which
counterpropaganda should be aimed but
-he spoke the thought aloud
   no he repeated  we dont expect any
more to quit because of this agitation
   that does seem unlikely remarked
viola sympathetically  considering that
they know your bank so well she maneu-
vered the conversation into other channels
and was departing when denton recalled
that he had not asked how sallin was pro-
gressing
   oh so splendidly said viola jubilant-
ly and she laughed inwardly over her real
meaning  he does better and better every
clay why just think of it hell soon have
the bandages off his eyes 
   thats great enthused denton i
hope your best expectations are realized
  bessie echoed his expression and so did
viola as the good nights said she laughed
softly and skipped over the lawn
  sallin was doing better every day-with
the help of taylor and odell and the citys
water pressure the news she brought him
to-night would be far from depressing
hadnt the damage momentarily done by
heusler been repaired and this jenkins
person wasnt so much as a detective
xi
  throughout the summer afternoons and
evenings sallin maintained his mummvlike
pose on the veranda constantly beside
him was viola the personification of loving
devotion sitting close to him her head fre-
quently cuddling his the picture came to
be an accepted one among the neighbors
who could not but applaud the way in
which viola clung to the man who after all
might be horribly disfigured
  such was the face the household pre-
sented on the outside to mask what was go-
ing on within
  from the other side of the cellar toward
the bank another tunnel was being run
though more than twice as long as that
which had been cut to the water main this
bigger work was being done with a mini-
mum of labor and with greater speed it
went on more quickly because there was
no need of being cautious about pick ax
blows lest their thudding might be heard
above ground for this drift that was to
reach the bank was being made by hydrau-
lic power with a stream at sixty pounds
pressure from the tapped main
  the sandy soil was ideal under the one-
inch stream from the six-inch hose it crum-
bled fast and was swept back into the cellar
to swirl down the drain in the flood
  it was soggy working but easy always
they were close up to the head of the drift
lengthening the hose as they advanced and
getting the full force of the water and the
only sound from their operations was the
steady swish-svrish as the powerful stream
carried them ever nearer to the million dol-
lars that was to repay their effort
  occasionally they had to stop to do some
shoveling but on the whole they were called
upon for little exertion other than steadying
the bucking nozzle and shoring up the shaft
for the latter need they kept on ripping out
lumber from the interior of the house the
upper floor and the attic were completely
wrecked more than the two thousand dol-
lars that had been paid on the house would
be required to repair it
  on the fourth day they reached the foun-
dation wall at the rear of the bank they
had gone forty-five feet
   their line was straight their calculations
correct they were within five feet of the
goal but before they attained that there
was the greatest difficulty to be overcome-
a solid mass of concrete to be gone through
and hardened steel
  here again violas friendship with bessie
and denton proved invaluable availing
herself of the invitation to visit the bank
and be shown how well the money was
protected she had learned something of
the construction of this particular vault

argosy-allstory weekly
  the bank stood by itself a square stone
building high ceilinged two stories high
the vault was to the rear projecting onto
the floor with three sides and the top ex-
posed its back to the wall steel incased in
concrete it seemed impregnable and viola
with many exclamatory  ohs as denton
showed her the massive walls and the huge
door with its complicated mechanism re-
marked on the tremendous strength of the
place also as she stood inside it her heel
rapped the armor plate floor and she spoke
of the impressive solidity of that too
   it is pretty solid denton had smiled
 there is plate and concrete and more
plate-and then two feet more of concrete
underneath
  viola had nodded brightly at that
 thats so no one can break in from the
cellar she had remarked knowingly
  and bessie again had shown how much
she knew about the bank by smiling and
shaking her head
   no fear of any one breaking in from
the cellar she said  because there is no
cellar not back here only in front
  whereat viola voiced another vague
 oh she had been aware that the cellar
did not extend beneath the vault what
she had sought to learn and had found out
was the thickness of the base of the vault
denton had told her had she asked him
at any other time about the construction of
the vault she might have awakened sus-
picion by coming to the bank to be awed
by the weightiness of the strong room she
had obtained this detail in a natural way
during his exposition
  odell and taylor reached the foundation
wall in the afternoon they rested there
and called sallin
  sallins face was eager as he made his
way through the muddy tunnel the con-
summation of his dream was near the
patience with which he had waited for this
moment was close to being rewarded
   well wait till night before we go on
he said softly his fingers lingering over the
bared masonry as though he would brush
it away  there are clerks up there-in
the niches on each side of the vault they
are close to the wall they might hear the
drill or notice the vibration a wall is a
good conductor
   we can scrape away the mortar with
a chisel objected odell  were getting
close to it now no use losing time
   thats the way i feel about it put in
taylor  this damned burrowing like a
rabbit is getting on my nerves-and usually
i havent any lets stick to it well hit
that concrete to-night
   all right sallin was not averse to
haste provided it did not jeopardise the un-
dertaking  how long will it take you
duke to bite through the concrete its
two feet thick
  taylor considered  i doubt whether it
can be done in a night he announced
 its a tough job well have to cut a hole
about eighteen inches in diameter-and
well have to do it piecemeal drilling at an
angle and breaking it out in scraps
  sallin was figuring on a definite date
   can we count upon getting in friday
this is tuesday that allows until thurs-
day three nights to get through the con-
crete after that mint you wont want
much time to put the finishing touches
ill say i wont promised odell
 once we hit into the plate well step into
that vault any time you like
   right said sallin  well wind up
friday if all goes well saturday anyhow
theres no use waiting for saturday-we
wouldnt have the advantage of sunday
for the get-away not with the way the
cards lie he turned to crawl from the
tunnel  ill start things moving outside
to make it friday
xii
  while the underground members of the
gang were clearing a working space under
the bank vault sallin speeded up his plan
to put into it the million dollars which he
was to take out rather he gave release
to the plan already well in motion that
was on wednesday
   kolinsky will have to do most of the
talking he told heusler who was making
his call as  dr perthwaite  de real
and fiorella remember are known and like-
ly are being tailed they can circulate
some but warn them to be careful
red for a million

  viola had managed to keep advised on
the success of the detective employed by the
bank they had not yet made an excuse
on which to jail de real or fiorella or to
run them out of town neither had they
identified kolinsky as one of the agitators
  sam heusler heaved his big bulk rest-
lessly
   when do i quit coming here he
queried  im getting well known-i mean
the folks round here  be able to give a
good line on me ill have a hell of a job
getting away
  sallin eyed him coldly and his tone was
chill  youll quit coming saturday night
when you carry us away
   you said id get a couple of days
start-
  with a motion sallin halted the protest
   well all start even he said grimly
if you cant take the chances with the rest
of us- he turned away the sentence
uncompleted
  heusler gathered his nerve to express
something that had been growing in his
mind
   there ought to be a better cut he be-
gan
  sallin wheeled on him his lips drawing
over his teeth
   its late in the day to talk about that
he rasped  youre down for ten per cent
and -he stopped close and his finger on
heuslers chest emphasized the words-
 and you get ten per cent see
 heusler backed up  well- he
stopped his glance wavering his hands
twitching  well-
  the word was snatched from his mouth
by sallin
   it is well he said with a flickering
menacing smile  its advisable too for
you to see it that way now listen he
ended the argument by taking up his in-
structions  these birds will have to get
in their big work on thursday night fri-
day morning they can go to the mills and
set off the fireworks some more i want the
rush to start friday morning
  heusler did not feel very companionable
toward sallin sallin acted too high-hand-
edly-let others take too much of the risk
   and for the love of heaven went on
sallin fervently  dont let them go off half
cocked this time
   ill tell them heusler defended him-
self in advance  if they ball it up it
wont be my fault
    see they dont ball it up then it can be
nobodys fault and the night we get
through-friday as things now stand-
youll come here in the evening about nine
oclock some time during the night vi and
i will leave with you
   i could leave you the car and go ear-
lier- heusler had no ambition to be in a
party on the flight there would be more
danger in numbers violas red hair would
be a flaming marker
   as you like sallin smiled and squint-
ed at him  how about your divvy how
do we get that to you
  heusler crumpled a cigar  yeh-thats
so i guess-ill have to stick where you
going to make for
  sallin held up his hands in negation
 well drop you anywhere you say or take
you into new york but when we finish
here sam i dont aim ever to see you again
im going- he waved the round of the
compass
   you have it all straight sallin be-
came brisk  friday morning the big show
is to begin that  make it right for us
if everything pans out have you told de
real and fiorella that the cops are onto
them
   no you said-
   they dont know it havent wised up
themselves
   theyd have spoken of it
   then you can slip them a hint to watch
their steps theres another thousand apiece
if they make good that will hold them
beat it now sam and get them tuned up
  that night after he had summoned ko-
linsky through de real and delivered the
final instructions heusler gave himself up
to disgruntled and surly thoughts
  first among these was his distaste for the
public part he had been given to play he
had a hunch that somebody was going to
bump into trouble sam was a good spy
and prospect hunter but he was not so good
as a field man he sincerely wished that

argosy-allstory weekly
he had not been tempted into active partici-
pation he could just as well have re-
mained on the outside and still collected a
substantial rake-off from sallin it wouldnt
have amounted to ten per cent but he might
have got half that
  second he was sore because he was get-
ting no more than ten per cent sallin was
a hog on the big end-sixty per cent for him
and viola sam couldnt dope out why
taylor and odell should get fifteen per cent
apiece--more than he was getting hadnt
they been under cover throughout while he
was in the open
  sam would have had more than that to
disturb him had he been within hearing
distance of de real fiorella and kolinsky
fiorella had trailed him a few days previ-
ously to sallins house they could not
make sure that it was sallin who occupied
it but they could guess shrewdly none
of them knew sallin personally but they
knew of his existence as a criminal director
of large caliber specializing in banks the
proximity to the bank of the house at which
heusler called therefore was significant
they were biding their time-to declare
themselves in with heusler if anything was
pulled off
   we start a riot in this town friday
was the way kolinsky communicated the
orders received from heusler
   what is doing asked de real
   dont know but -kolinsky winked
and his mouth widened- its something
good sure thing we have to keep tab on
heusler
   its funny business opined fiorella
 what we stirrin up these guys for
   i just said i dont know responded
kolinsky  but theres a thousand more in
it for us thats regular we get it by
mail saturday if the riot comes off
  de real smiled leanly  we shall have
to watch heusler very closely when he
comes here is that all he told you
 kolinsky pondered uh-huh he
thought it better not to pass on the warning
that heusler had given about detectives
his companions might be perturbed enough
to drop out he wanted help in handling
heusler and he did not desire to introduce
any new faces
  furthermore heusler would have started
a rapid fade-out right then had he but
known that jenkins the detective was on
the verge of establishing the connection
between the agitators and their immediate
chief he was checking up on the phone
call to de real made by heusler when
he summoned kolinsky that led jenkins
to a cigar store in new york city and ap-
parently into a blind alley but jenkins
was persistent he had landed in blind
alleys ere this-and gone beyond them
xiii
  friday morning the external waves of
sallins contriving burst into full motion
the  riot  began on schedule
  frank denton saw the initial evidence of
it through the windows of the bank before
the opening hour at ten oclock
  more than a score of the foreign born
mill workers were standing there and
they were visibly excited
  denton pointed them out to trainor the
president his face became troubled
   more accounts closing he said
 whats the latest word from jenkins mr
trainor
   he phoned a few minutes ago that these
agitators did a lot of circulating last night
and this morning replied trainor  he
talked with some of the people they talked
to and learned that word is being dis-
seminated that the bank is unsound sup-
pose we let those fellows in frank and you
talk to them
  several more depositors joined the cluster
at the door they were jabbering in their
native tongues and gesticulating
  denton glanced at the clock a quarter
to ten
   theres one there that i know well he
said  he was among the first to come to
us when i directed the missionary work for
the bank at the mills ill call him in
  a chorus went up from the little crowd
as denton approached the door they
pressed forward when they saw that he was
going to open it some reaching through
the outer grilled door pounded on the plate
glass with their fists their clamor grew as
denton opened the inner door
red for a million

  through the hubbub he called to the man
he wanted the cries partly ceased and he
asked the man to enter the others let
their fellow come to the front but when
denton slid back the grille to let him come
in they also tried to force a way another
besides the favored one crushed by before
denton could again bar the entrance
  denton gave them a friendly smile they
answered with sullen looks
   what do you want
  the man who had intruded replied with a
torrent of words mostly in his own language
from the scattered english phrases in it
denton gathered that the bank was  no
good the man brandished his bank book
he wanted his money
  trainor come forward to listen stared
in amazement his brows drew together
as he saw that the crowd outside was in-
creasing
  denton was questioning the man he
knew
   what craziness is this joe he asked
with a carefree assumption that was in di-
rect contrast with his feelings he also
noticed the growing numbers at the door
 whats he talking about when he says the
bank is no good you know how good it
is-
   me no know vociferated joe excited-
ly  you been give our money to them
capitalists to beat us till its gone you
been- in his agitation he wandered off
into a flood of polish
  denton looked at trainor the presi-
dent was very grave his eyes traveled to
the clock five minutes to ten
   well have to make ready for that
crowd frank theres a hundred there
now
  denton continued to smile on the twain
who apparently were speaking the belief
of the throng  who says the bank is no
good he used the unfortunate expression
because they understood it best its repeti-
tion served only to impress it more strongly
on their minds
  everybody we know fellas tells
us such was the meat of their voluble
and butchered answer
  the futility of argument was plain they
were in a panic they saw their savings be-
ing swept away-and that into the hands of
the capitalist the slave driver
  denton stepped aside with the president
from the street came a renewed murmuring
   we cant stall them he asserted the
obvious  all we can do is pay them and
while were doing so try to restore their con-
fidence well stack up all the currency we
have in plain sight it will look like mil-
lions to them and may cool them off
  the president sputtered  my god
frank its a run thats what it is good
lord a run on the bank of norford it
was sacrilegious he glared angrily but
nervously at the chattering scores who
blocked the sidewalk scrutiny of the mot-
ley crew aroused his caution
   we cant let that mob in until we have
protection he decided  hey you he
called to a clerk with a lack of dignity that
under less distressing circumstances would
have been impossible  phone the police
to send a squad here at once tell them to
hurry we cant open until they arrive
my god frank he ran a hand over his
brow and it came away wet this was the
most amazing event he had ever witnessed
a run on his bank
   the police- denton doubted the
advisability of having them  their pres-
ence may only stir these folks up more he
counseled  i dont believe theyll start
anything-get out of hand-if we let them
see that there is plenty of cash
   well have the police said trainor
stubbornly  look at them
  the crowd was milling more compactly
about the door they knew that ten oclock
had struck the opening hour-and the bank
bad not opened
  for ten long minutes they watched the
shuffling throng whose mutterings swelled
louder and more sustained once denton
attempted to reason with them through the
grilled door but they howled them down
and clawed through the bars at him
  an automobile with six policemen was
pulling up when jenkins telephoned
  trainor spoke with him
   ive just had three of the agitators
thrown out of the mills reported the de-
tective  they were going round advising
the workers to get their money before its

argosy-allstory weekly
too late they say your bank is busted
and that you are preferring the moneyed
people in making settlements
  trainor swore between gasps he heard
jenkins continue
   you can prepare for a rush bunches
of them are quitting work to go get their
money from you anything doing down
your way yet
  anything doing trainors voice
creaked excitedly  theyre besieging the
place thats all why the devil dont
you do something to protect us jenkins
thats what we pay you for get busy
do something lock these men up make
a charge against them get them-
   its past time for doing that mr trai-
nor interrupted the detective  you
should have let me do it days ago
but you wouldnt stand for framing them
trainor bobbed up and down with rage
 what in the name of god are we to
do he shouted  weve got a mob here
-and you say calmly that theres more
coming theres somebody back of this
jenkins find who it is
   im trying to do that said jenkins
patiently  and meantime all you can do
is-pay
   i know that-and we can do it
snapped trainor  but we cant handle
them all we havent that much money in
the place we need time we have to get
currency from new york
   make time retorted jenkins  count
out their cash in one dollar bills-in quar-
ters and halves dont pay at more than
one window you can make time if you
need it im going back on the job ill
phone you later how about protection
have you got the police
   theyre here said trainor  were
waiting till they get the mob lined up before
we open
   im bringing half a dozen of my men
over from new york right away theyre
huskies and will help keep order ill be in
later ill hold the three birds who made
the trouble
  herded by the policemen the depos-
itors were in a long cue on the sidewalk
as denton had predicted the coming of the
police did not improve their temper they
were quieter in the presence of the officers
but their looks were blacker in the call-
ing of the police they read confirmation of
the fear that their money was lost
  at ten thirty the bank opened but the
grilled gate was drawn only wide enough
to admit one person at a time at each side
of it was a policeman inside were two oth-
ers patrolling the cue were four more
  frank denton was in the only tellers
cage that was to serve the stampeders
other depositors were to be handled at an-
other wicket
  beside denton were great stacks of cur-
rency behind his cage clerks were piling
up more it was a desperate but impressive
display of strength made in the hope that
those who departed with their demands met
would tell their fellows that there was lots
of money and so stay the panic
  at ten thirty-one denton smiled on the
first of the line to be admitted he scanned
the withdrawal slip which called for four-
teen hundred and sixty dollars he sent
the pass book back to have the balance
verified 
  two minutes later he started to count out
fourteen hundred and sixty dollars in one
dollar bills
  the bank had to have time if it should
pay out with customary speed the cash in
the vaults totaling less than two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars must be ex-
hausted before noon time was necessary
to rush in funds from the reserve bank to
meet the emergency
xiv
  as the day wore on the run increased in
volume it was felt elsewhere in the town
and so became a sensation the bank of
norford called loans its borrowers could
make good with money obtained from other
banks the stacks of currency back of
frank denton had to be replenished but
no matter how slowly he paid out they
diminished alarmingly
  by early afternoon the panic among the
foreign element communicated to some of
the more stable citizens the calling of
loans had much to do with that they did
not understand that this measure was taken
red for a million

as a means of stalling along pending the
arrival of currency from the reserve bank
in new york city securities and time
paper was being realized on there while the
bank of norfords physical reserve was
being brought in
  crowds packed the street outside the
bank the line of those who wanted to
close their accounts constantly lengthened
by two oclock the last of the fifteen hun-
dred mill workers joined it
  up to that hour denton handled about a
hundred depositors he went about his task
with a semblance of confident cheerfulness
he was unflurried and methodical as ever
and he made his painstaking slowness seem
like speed approximately he had paid out
two hundred thousand dollars
  under normal conditions he could have
disposed of four times as many people
these were not normal conditions he was
still paying in small bills obtained from the
other banks in town because the cash had
not yet come from new york
  at the meeting of the board of directors
which sat throughout the day the proposal
was made to exert the banks prerogative of
thirty days notice on withdrawals that
was voted down when the ill effect of refusal
to pay was accented
   we can dally as we have been doing
said denton  but we mustnt stop paying
the minute we do that there will be a
riot if we keep on passing out currency
that crowd wont get rough they may
growl but they wont begin to smash things
stop paying and theyll go wild
   denton is right said trainor whose
head had steadied after the first shock he
was all business now protecting his bank
 we have to keep on making motions
the bigger depositors know well that were
solvent and they are standing off some
of them have come forward with cash to
help us out well weather it without a
battle out there in the street as long as we
continue to pay
  the directors listened to that argument
and were convinced
  i you can speed up a little now frank
said trainor  a million and a half is on
the way from new york it may get here
before closing time if not soon after
  the other banks when appealed to came
to the assistance of the norford with up-
ward of a hundred thousand in liberty
bonds and other fast collateral dentons
fingers riffled faster over the bills but he
did not make real haste the stacks of
currency surrounding him dwindled too fast
for safety already they were stuffed-cash
was being piled on top of ledgers and de-
posit boxes to make it look like something
substantial he was playing more than ever
against time for it appeared that the million
and a half could not reach norford from
new york before the closing hour until
then appearances must be maintained in
the morning all comers would get their
money as quickly as it could be counted
meantime-
  at three oclock the bank closed it had
twelve thousand and some odd dollars left
two score of policemen were on the scene
for the closing there was the moment
fraught with danger
  the precaution was well taken when
they found that no more was to be paid
that day the throng that had stood in line
for hours broke into a wailing that soon
rose into a vicious angry shouting they
scattered from the cue which the police
had kept intact and jammed the street in
front of the bank
  the policemen bore the demonstration
with tolerance they contented themselves
with keeping the walk clear the crowd
weaved back and forth but abstained from
violence it lacked a leader lacked the
provocation of a violent act
  about three thirty the police opened a
way for the heavily guarded machine which
finally arrived with the currency it was
that however which fired the mob
  the machine which by its very stanch-
ness reflected money pulled up on the side-
walk to the bank door a silence fell then
as the door wras opened and the autos
freight was unloaded as strong boxes were
passed into the bank those nearest began
to shout there was money in these boxes
they wanted money-their money the
bank was no good if that money got into
a no-good bank it would be gone
  so they yelled and the thousand others
behind them who were as vitally interested

argosy-allstory weekly
took up the cry and the several thousands
back of them women and children mostly
reechoed it
  they pushed forward the police aided
by jenkinss huskies pushed them back
they pressed on they surged and fought
a policeman hard put to it used his stick
on a head a rock was thrown
  another policeman being borne back by
weight of numbers felt a knife rip his
shoulder he struck down a man one of
the plate glass windows of the bank was
smashed by a stone the clamor became
the deep toned baying of a mob become fu-
rious and out of hand
   hustle that stuff the police captain
in charge called to the men unloading the
money  we can hold them about one
more minute then-
   all out said denton from the door-
way he slammed the iron grille
  the crowd roared the money had
passed into the bank that was no good
   get your machine moving the cap-
tain ordered the chauffeur  im going to
use it to break up these hoots
  his men still held a clear space on the
walk but they had to fight for it gun in
hand he swung aboard the automobile
  from the midst of the mob a revolver
shot rang out others followed
  the captain called upon the crowd to dis-
perse they howled in their several tongues
more furiously he spoke to his men
   no shooting unless you have to but
-use your sticks if they buck you go to
em
  the police went the auto helped back-
ing into the mob again and again
  one policeman was shot a dozen of the
besiegers were laid out with broken skulls
the police were being overcome when an-
other force attacked the rear of the mob
and the half hour battle was ended
  for an hour thereafter the chief of police
and substantial citizens including the mill
managers and superintendents harangued
the several crowds which collected they
told of the money that had been brought
from new york hadnt the mob with
their own eyes seen it unloaded in the
morning it would be distributed more was
coming they talked earnestly these men
singling out among the crowds those they
could best thump some sense of the situa-
tion into at length they drove home the
futility of further trouble many were per-
suaded to leave many remained to see
that the precious boxes were not removed
but quiet had been restored
  the police threw lines about the building
the affair simmered down for the night
inside the bank the million and a half of
currency was checked and stowed in the
vault the weary clerks went home under
police escort
  trainor and denton remained in the
bank as did the treasurer there was al-
ways the chance that the mob might re-
gather and attempt to storm the building
but for that possibility the vault might not
have been locked that night
  sallin had bet that it would be locked-
that just such a condition would prevail
he won
  viola sat late with bessie wentworth that
evening she had to learn how matters
stood in the bank
  bessie was worried about denton she
feared he might be attacked on the way
home
  viola spoke reassuringly across the lots
they could see that the bank remained
lighted
  they may stay there all night said
viola  what did he say when you talked
to him a while back
   that they might stay said bessie
 wh-what if that crowd breaks in 
   im sure there is no danger dear
viola soothed her  phone him again and
have him if he can run over to see you
hell tell you that he is perfectly safe that
the trouble is past
  she patted bessies hand encouragingly
   ye-es conceded bessie tremulously
 i suppose it is she took violas sugges-
tion  i-ill phone him
    it is said that they got millions in this
afternoon added viola this was what
she wanted to know  in the morning
they will be able to pay every one the
crowd knows that ask frank if it isnt so
dear she was craftily insinuating  these
people saw the money go in they realize
red for a million

that they cant get it before morning ask
frank hell tell you thats so
  in her anxiety bessie failed to observe
the trace of eagerness which viola could not
altogether suppress she asked denton
about the shipment of currency
   were all set bessie he said cheerful-
ly over the phone  its a case of waiting
for morning    no there wontbe any
more trouble
   why are you staying in the bank
then frank
   im staying -he gave a womans rea-
son which she being a woman could not
understand- oh because
  thought came to her of the procedure the
bank had had to pursue that day the
panic-stricken depositors would not stand
for that again
   youre sure you wont have to pay so
slowly to-morrow she demanded suspi-
ciously if you do- how much money
have you
   we wont replied denton happily
 well pay at all four windows as fast as
we can shovel it out were all fixed now
although ill tell you sweetheart we were
down to twelve thousand when we closed
we couldnt have lasted ten more min-
utes
   how much have you now she in-
sisted
   a million and a half he answered
truthfully and viola started as the girl
repeated the amount  that is locked in
the vault now continued denton  and
as much more will be here in the morning
they talked longer of more intimate
things and more material when she pressed
for assurance that he had had something to
eat
    the police brought food in to us he
told her -  were o k except that we
havent anything more comfortable than
chairs to sleep on
  whereupon bessie lamented over his dis-
comfort and promised to obey his injunc-
tion to forget it and go to sleep herself
  from bessie thus viola learned the
amount of cash available and that the
vault was locked although three of the bank
officials remained on the premises
  gleefully she went home to sallin
  his lithe figure tensed and the pulses
throbbed at his temples
   into the hole boys he said to taylor
and odell  ill be right after you the
big clean-up is on
  he turned to sam heusler
   get out sam and shoot the five hun-
dred bonus to de real fiorella and kolin-
sky no-make it a thousand each theyve
earned it he gave heusler six five hun-
dred dollar bills heusler was addressing
three envelopes in which to mail the money
when the doorbell rang viola answered it
her face was troubled when she returned
 its a man for you sam de real
an oath sizzled from sallin  how did
he get here he snarled at heusler
   how the hell do i know heusler
snarled back his nerves were crackling
 i didnt tell him
  sallin stifled his fury this was not the
moment for a clash de real could know
nothing
   go see him sallin smiled poisonous-
ly on heusler he was glad sam had
agreed to be on hand at the finish he
would want to see sam-very much-if the
robbery fell down at its consummation
  in trepidation heusler went downstairs
to meet his visitor de real also smiled
upon him-anticipatorily
   we are arrested-my friends and my-
self he related  one thousand dollars
bail is required for each we made up
enough to get me out two thousand dol-
lars is required to release my friends
heusler breathed more freely
   what is the charge
   conspiracy they say de real
shrugged  we shall not come back to
hear the rest of it you will give us the
money you promised-and the three thou-
sand dollars for our bonds yes
   how did you know to come here
scowled heusler
  de reals shoulders moved again  i
just-came
  heusler did not parley his cue was to
get rid of de real
   wait a minute he went upstairs to
sallin who with few words gave him the
additional money

argosy-allstory weekly
   get him out he said  and advise
him to leave town v
while heusler was seeing de real on
his way sallin drew viola to him
   do you want to leave now vi be-
fore we make the break they may open
the vault while were in it you can take
heuslers car-
   ill stay she said quietly  well go
together floyd
  his eyes kindled on her  a million
vi thats what we went after and we
take a million and a half for the rest of
our lives vi-
  silently they contemplated the alluring
future the red-head rubbed back and
forth it was the last caress sallin would
have from that red-head as he went to
direct his cracksmen viola went to soak
her gorgeously flaring crown in a bath of
indigo

  while the three bank officials slumbered
restlessly and the watchman kept his usual
vigil beside the eighteen-inch steel and con-
crete walls of the vault the oxy-acetylene
torch burned a way through the floor of it
for sallin odell and taylor
  once during their labor trainor the
president sat bolt upright from his sleep
that was while the drill in taylors hand
was nibbling out the layer of concrete im-
mediately beneath the floor of the vault
   do you hear anything trainor spoke
sharply to the watchman
  no sir what the watchman
looked out the front windows at the police-
men patrolling they were the only per-
sons in sight
  trainor was peeved over his sleep having
been broken it had been none too good at
best curled up as he was in a chair
  he listened and he heard nothing be-
cause his senses were tricking him he had
not heard the drilling he had felt it un-
consciously he had registered the vibration
which in his full consciousness he could not
define
   nothing he said  i was dreaming
i guess it was reasonable to believe that
he had been dreaming after his stressful
day
  the watchman noted the time he
punched his clock
  trainor squirmed into his chair
   what time is it
   one oclock sir
  ugh said trainor he glowered at
denton who was smiling in his sleep and
at the treasurer who slouched wide-mouthed
and snoring
  as the flame of the torch licked a hole
through the floor of the vault and began
to turn out a circle big enough to admit a
man the president of the bank of norford
composed himself again to sleep
  at two thirty sallin odell and taylor
made their last trip through the tunnel they
had bored to strike into the bank from be-
low they were muddy and perspiring
their muscles were cramped from stooping
but they had in their possession three-quar-
ters of a million dollars in hundred-dollar-
bills a quarter of a million in fifties an-
other quarter million in tens and a third
quarter in fives and ones fifty feet away
policemen circled the bank from which it
had been taken they saw the lights in
the house through the block did these same
policemen but lights in a private dwelling
meant nothing though the hour was late
sallin was avoiding any evidence of stealth
on the get-away
  in the living room of the house that had
served so well as a base of operations they
divided the cash-two hundred and twenty-
five thousand each for odell and taylor
one hundred and fifty thousand for heus-
ler nine hundred thousand for floyd sal-
lin and viola
  his face alight sallin looked over his
accomplices he had cashed in at last on
his dream
   were through boys he said softly
 from now on its every man for him-
self
  taylor looked up from stuffing his stack
of hundreds and fifties into a hand bag
   mint and i are going to hang together
he announced  eh mint they had
been working partners for many years
they could take their chances together to
the end
   thats what said odell  chuck
                         	a
red for a million

that into your bag duke he tossed over
his fortune like so much dross
  sam heusler alone in the company
showed fear his face was pallid he turned
over with shaking hands the paper package
into which he had wrapped his share
   you-youre going to take me with
you chief he begged  you arent go-
ing to quit me here
  sallin regarded him contemptuously he
raised his eyebrows as he glanced at viola
she stood keyed up but nerveful arrayed
for the street in a plain tailored suit she
seemed now to be of slighter build her
clear complexion had become olive the
 birthmark  was gone from the left cheek
and her hair that had been so entrancingly
ruddy was a glistening black
   you ride into new york with us said
sallin to heusler  then you shift for
yourself you boys -he smiled on the
two cracksmen -  can climb aboard the
machine down street if you please or
you can jump the blind on a train that goes
through at three twenty we dont want
to leave here in a bunch with the cops look-
ing on we can make it look like a party
breaking up what say
  taylor and odell glanced at each other
and nodded
   the rattler they agreed they knew
the ways of the jungles and in this instance
they preferred these to the highroad
  sallin picked up the two suit cases that
held his and violas loot he had changed
to clean clothes from those he had worn on
the wealth-laden trips through the tunnel
so had taylor and odell all was ready
for the get-away
  you two duke and mint go first
said sallin he was cold as ice except for
the glow of victory in his eyes the smile
that radiated in little waves from the cor-
ners of his mouth  you turn to the left
along the street its a dark night step
along as though you belonged away from
here youll be all right a lot of those bo-
hunks are loafing around i guess waiting
for first crack in the morning at the cash
they wont get
  he led the way to the door in the ves-
tibule he laid down the grips and gave a
hand to taylor and odell
    	a
 the door was opened they stood in the
 faint light from the hall
  good night said sallin in an ordinary
 tone
  good night
  good night
 it was naturally done there might be
 some one within hearing
  good luck boys whispered odell as
 they turned awav
  luck chief
 they were gone turning down the street
 to ihe left
  theyre game vi they  make out
 it was a hint to heusler to take a brace
  well all make out said viola in sharp
 undertone  if we play half as well as they
 do
 sam heuslers teeth clattered
  lets go he whispered huskily  lets
 get-
  after you sam said sallin  well
 pick you up two blocks west that was
 in the opposite direction from main street
  you go to the right from here then two
 blocks west
 heusler clutched at him
  youre quitting me he whimpered
 sallins fingers bit into his arms
  were not quitting you two blocks
 over is where well meet you
 heusler was afraid-but he knew that
 sallins word was good sallin never had
 thrown a pal
  youre wasting time sam said sallin
  get going we want no jam getting out
 of here ready vi going sam
  ready answered viola she took up
 one of the grips sallin took the other
  so help your god you wont quit me
 wheezed sam
  so help me sallin opened the door
  youre yellow sam he added dispas-
 sionately
 precipitately sam went into the darkness
 he did not hear sallins  good luck if
 he did he gave no response
 they allowed him three minutes
 with magnificent effrontery sallin and
 viola wished good night to nobody
 they shut the door leaving the lights in
 the house burning and walked without
 haste to the car

argosy-allstory weekly
  starting it there was still no attempt at
concealment sallin raced the engine
throttled it down and moved away at not
over eight miles an hour he threw on the
headlights making the turn into the street
on which they were to meet sam a block
down he dimmed them and slowed
  at the designated corner they stopped
   hells damnation
  sallins curse was the first speech since
leaving the house
  heusler was not there
  viola gripped sallins arm  the fool
she breathed  he came this way-the
yellow pup we cant wait floyd hes
had time-
   well give him his chance said sallin
 wait he got out of the machine and
stooped as though examining a shoe
  sixty dragging seconds they waited sal-
lin returned to his seat the car was mov-
ing when viola gripped his arm
  there she pointed is that-
no there are two men there-three
men
  the machine gathered speed
xvi
  discovery of the body of sam heusler
opened the second day of sensations in the
town of norford a milkman crossing a
vacant lot stumbled upon it just round the
corner from where sallin had lived there
was the mark of a weighty blow on the
face-and a knife wound between the ribs
the knife had penetrated the heart
  the body was found soon after six
oclock instantly it vied in interest with
the crowd already assembling to withdraw
their funds from the bank of norford
  on account of the latter situation the
town generally was early astir in this
neighborhood were few who had been
drawn into the run on the bank many
there were depositors however and they
were up betimes to watch developments
from the side lines with a more peculiar
concern than the ordinary spectator
  among these early risers was bessie
wentworth her waking action was to
telephone frank denton he reported a
wearisome night with  all well
   theres a crowd out front already he
informed bessie  but they seem to have
lost their pep if they had as rotten a
night as i had i dont wonder
   poor dear boy murmured bessie
 im going to send you something nice for
breakfast what do you want frank
   well now- denton considered  i
know he asserted suddenly you get
em for me bess and ill love you twice as
much
   then you admit that you dont love me
all you might she challenged
   of course i do but this-
   never mind your excuses she pouted
 you cant explain tell me what you
want
   ill explain this afternoon when i get
you-- he interrupted himself as trainor
awoke and turned heavy eyes on him he
reverted to his breakfast hankering  i
want creamed shrimp on toast and a pair of
coddled eggs bessie sweetheart do i get
them
  the easiest thing it would be fun
making breakfast for frank like the days
that were to come  ill go right out and
get the shrimp in the first store that opens
it  be canned of course frank but-
  denton laughed deprecatingly  of
course you will not go out i didnt think
of that make it four coddled and forget
the-
   i wont forget it stated bessie indig-
nantly  youll get what you want and
a melon and cream and coffee and hot rolls
and cruellers and-and-and a shark steak
if you say so
   that  be great he accepted buoyant-
ly  bring what you said and forget the
shr-
   i wont forget it she repealed  and
you wont see or hear from me until i bring
it over so there
  and bessie hung up to dress hurriedly for
the street her frank could not be denied
what he most desired for breakfast after
having had to sleep in that horrid bank all
night
  consequently bessie was outdoors before
seven oclock
  in her quest for shrimp she went along
the street in the direction sam heusler had
red for a million

taken from the sallin house at the first
intersection she noticed a crowd a few lots
distant policemen were there with ex-
cusable curiosity she stepped aside
  as she came up another policeman made
his way through the knot of people she
caught a glimpse of the man lying dead on
the grass
  bessie screamed through horrified sobs
she identified heusler as  dr perthwaite
who attended mr sallin
   that helps said detective blakeley
of the police department  where does
this guy sallin live
  bessie led them to the house there
there was an immediate evidence of some-
thing out of gear though it was daylight
the house was still illuminatd
  when no one answered the repeated rings
the police broke in the absence of occu-
pants coupled with the ruin made by the
tearing out of the floors inspired more com-
plete investigation the twin tunnels were
found and the ruck of hose and other para-
phernalia in the cellar
  in this way through the murder of sam
heusler the robbery of the bank of nor-
ford was discovered backward
  when a policeman entered the bank and
notified trainor the president another po-
liceman was standing in the vault when
trainor opened it
  that was at seven forty-five oclock
  the vault was clear of cash excepting the
twelve hundred odd dollars that had been
on hand at the previous close of business
nothing else had been tampered with no
effort made to break open the strong boxes
which contained securities the money had
been easy to take because it had literally
just been dumped inside to be handy when
the bank reopened to meet the run
  jenkins arrived while trainor denton
the treasurer and the police were gawping
at the looted vault the hole in the floor and
the tunnel told the whole story but they
were having difficulty grasping it so enor-
mous was the job
  the little detective whistled like a flash
he saw through the scheme largely that
was because he had been wearily perplexed
by the campaign against the bank
  a genius-a genius in robbery he
spoke his thoughts aloud  pulling off a
run to get a bunch of cash here
  his tone was not without admiration it
riled trainor
   if we had a genius in the shape of a de-
tective he exploded  we might get a start
on capturing the genius robber
  jenkins received that with customary
mildness  mebbe you dont need a genius
where does the hole lead to
  to where there is nobody now of
course where did you think trainor
lost his dignity again this was the finish
two hours hence the mob would be back
clamoring for the money that was gone
already it was gathering and there was
twelve hundred dollars to face it with
  trainor suddenly aged ten years he
slumped into a chair
   to where theres nobody he iterated
less venomously  and i suppose no trace
of who was there except a dead man
   a dead man jenkins jumped at that
he had been doing something himself de-
spite trainors unkind remarks the three
agitators he had locked up had given him a
little to work on  how was he killed-
where
    in a lot round the corner said a police-
man  must have been a quarrel on the
get-away he has been known as a doctor
tending a man in the house the tunnel
comes from
  the twinkling eyes of jenkins twinkled
more brightly as he assembled the known
facts he put trainor aside and gave his
ear to denton when the latter told what he
knew of the sallin household
  blakely the local sleuth also pricked up
at that he went after denton cross-ex-
amining
   youre quitting the bank aint you to
go to another he fired belligerently at last
 you knew the whole gang you visited
them-they visited you what dyou
know his gaze transfixed the flabber-
gasted denton  well want you young
feller you and your girl wheres she
say- dont you stir out of here well
want you
  with a burst of energy he plumped into
the tunnel and went blundering through it
to tear apart what sallin and his crew had

argosy-allstory weekly
left of the house blakely was looking for
a clew
  the accusation left denton gasping
jenkins drew him aside
   dont you bother about him he said
 he doesnt know there are four angles to
this case and on one of them  bet i
know who killed this doctor guy who ill
bet again was named sam heusler and trav-
eled in funny company
   eh what trainor thrust himself
forward  whats this youre saying jen-
kins for gods sake -he lapsed into
pathos- if you can see anything like day-
light go after it man go after it we -
his voice broke- this old bank is out of
business
  jenkins refused to be hurried
   well get nowhere by flying off mr
trainor he said gently  will you let
me be and if that sleuth who thinks he
wants to pinch denton asks where denton
has gone say hes over at his girls house
were going there tell him jenkins
chortled  he can get them both at one time
over there come on denton i want your
girl to tell me more about the red head
xvii
  by nine oclock while almost the entire
police force was forming a cordon for a
block around the bank and excluding all
who were not on official business jenkins
had an alarm sent out for de real fiorella
and kolinsky his men had failed to find
them at their lodgings or any trace of
them in town he swore heartily because
the police had not photographed and bertil-
loned them because they had been granted
bail but he had a fair description of them
to put on the wires also he offered a thou-
sand dollars reward for the capture of any
of them dead or alive he charged them
with murder
  the local police followed his lead they
threw their net for the three agitators plus
one red-headed woman these four with
heusler they concluded made up the rob-
ber band
  jenkins let them think so he encour-
aged them to think so by informing them
that he had established direct relationship
between the agitators and heusler by fol-
lowing up the phone call from the cigar store
in new york to de real a few days previ-
ously in addition he told them that de
real had visited the sallin house the night
before just prior to bailing his companions
the bitterness in jenkinss cup was that his
operative who had shadowed de real had
lost the trio immediately afterward
  but it was on the red head that jenkins
concentrated the wrash basin in the sal-
lin house he found was stained a rich deep
blue that apparently was fresh among
the fund of information catalogued in his
head he recalled that the women of north-
ern africa arabia persia and the east in-
dies use indigo in conjunction with henna
on their hair the indigo applied on top of
henna makes a glossy black
  jenkins advised the police to look for a
black-haired woman
  conversation with bessie had raised
doubt in his mind about the genuineness of
the red head yet bessie would not say
that it had been manufactured
   i looked to see whether there was any
darkening at the roots of her hair bessie
confessed  but i never saw any it was
such wonderful hair if it hadnt been natu-
ral i dont believe it could have remained
so consistently brilliant
   she could have treated it every night
said jenkins  now about sallin did
you ever hear her say where the explosion
took place that mussed him there was no
explosion of course-there is no record of
any dr perthwaite and he anyhow has
been identified as heusler-but we might as
well prove there was none
   it occurred in new york city said
bessie
   well find out jenkins dispatched a
telegram
   tell me everything you can remember
about them he went on  was there any
little characteristic that she showed-or
sallin your description of her isnt worth
much it might fit a hundred women out
of a thousand with her hair a different
color and dressed differently her complex-
ion changed and all that it probably
wouldnt begin to fit her did she have any
noticeable gesture or trick of expression
red for a million

  viola loomed as a rather indistinct figure
her hair was what had impressed every one
who had seen her to the eclipse of her
other features
   i cant think of anything said bessie
slowly  only that she was terribly devoted
to him-or appeared to be
   devoted how so wifely devotion
wasnt a great deal to go on but jenkins
was overlooking nothing
   oh - just bessies mind wandered
she was thinking of denton back there in
the bank to reach which the angry de-
positors already were fighting the police
   just what jenkins sharpened his
tone to bring her back to the question
   oh she was always - always loving
him replied bessie none too definitely
 petting him and-and leaning her cheek
against his bandaged face that-thats
all i meant
 umph jenkins couldnt see any
progress here  you never heard sallins
voice he asked again
  bessie had not nothing more than a
murmur of it through the bandaging
neither had any one else
   see if you can think of anything that
would help identify the woman he urged
as he left bessie  im going to follow up
the machine they got away in if i can but
if you remember anything tell it to the op-
erative im leaving here ill be in touch
with him
  passing out of town in a fast automo-
bile jenkins looked grimly on the crowds
storming the police lines surrounding the
bank from their point of view the rob-
bery was a fake and they refused to be-
lieve that more currency was on the way
from new york
   he is one bird the guy who worked
this quoth jenkins  and since nobody
round here ever saw his face it looks like
hell get away with it heusler got jabbed
when he was lighting out with his divvy-
thats a safe bet the three bolsheviks
werent in on the big deal but they horned
the red-head is the bunk-doesnt mean
anything a red-head and a bandaged-
iaced man theres a hell of a combina-
tion the only other definite item we have
about her is that shes a loving wife yah 
  abruptly he leaned forward in his seat
in the speeding car he stared with widen-
ing eyes
   by-by-by- he searched for an
adequate expression he leaned back
   let her pop till she busts bill he
said softly to the chauffeur referring to the
car
  well said jenkins well we-ell
xviii
  the most direct way from norford
brought jenkins into new york over broad-
way from yonkers he telephoned his
office to inquire whether any one police-
man or motorist had been found who re-
membered seeing the sallin machine come
in the cars number was not available
but a good description of it had been given
   theyre fishing it out of the harlem
river his office recounted  at least it
seems to be the same car weve got a man
up there
  in the river jenkins tingled he
would have liked to run the case out but
if it was to wind up this way it was well
enough  whatd they do run through
an open draw
   no it isnt at the bridge its in a
slip where theres a dead-end street up at
two hundred and seventh
  jenkinss hopes fell
   any bodies
   havent heard yet we just got the
tip fifteen minutes ago somebody saw the
car as the tide went down
   im going there
  when he reached the place a derrick-
scow was running tackle about the partly
submerged machine the car was upside
down
  a police launch was casting grappling
irons it was believed there were bodies
because a watchman at a power station on
the river edge recollected having heard a
splash he had looked out but hearing
nothing further no cries for help decided
that it had signified nothing
  but though they dragged the slip they
brought up no bodies
  talking over the phone with norford
jenkins received more encouraging news

argosy-allstory weekly
than he had to present the run on the
bank had been checked by the arrival of
more currency about noon the morning
had been filled with clashes between the
panicky depositors and the police but the
results were no worse than a few minor in-
juries quiet again prevailed with the
bank paying off as fast as its tellers could
count
  about three oclock in the afternoon it
developed that a motor boat was missing
from a boathouse on the slip into which the
automobile had hurdled the boat had
been moored outside the house and seem-
ingly had slipped its painter about the
same hour the harbor police reported the
boat picked up adrift in the upper bay
below bedloes island
  because of the fact that if the idea he
had was to be made good sallin must be
captured quickly jenkins took up the in-
cident of the motor boat he noted where
it had been found-and that the tide was
coming in had it gone down the harlem
river on the ebbing tide which makes an
appreciable current into the east river it
would not have got into the bay it could
not have drifted that fast failure to dis-
cover any victims of the motor car in the
river was a suggestive factor there was
no doubt about the car being that which
heusler had used as  dr perthwaite and
in which sallin and viola had escaped
  the machine in the river at the point
from which a boat had disappeared the
same night offered at least a coincidence
worth investigating the watchman who
had heard the car plunge into the water had
not noticed the departure of any motor
boat it could have been poled out into the
river stream and so got away noiselessly
  jenkins sent a wireless broadcast over
the sea asking all ships that sailed that day
whether they had picked up any one from
a boat he set inquiries going along the
water front among the tugs and barges and
pilot boats and ships that had come into
port
  and with several operatives he went over
to staten island the point at which the
boat had been found drifting judging by
the set of the tide indicated that it might
have been cast loose from the island
   well comb staten island with fine
teeth he instructed his men  i doubt
whether the woman is there she probably
crossed back to manhattan on the ferry
but the man-theres a chance
  during the night jenkins and his men
rested it was useless to search in the dark
for a man whose face they would not recog-
nize about whom they knew positively
nothing other than that he was of slight
build and assumably clean shaven
  with daylight some of them went abroad
on the island jenkins and an assistant set
out in a fast launch down the inner shore
from port richmond another launch took
the outer shore
   stop everywhere was jenkinss final
order  look at everybody-every man
who in any way slightly resembles in build
the guy were after there is ten thousand
in it for the man who gets him i dont
believe hes camping in manhattan or
brooklyn the heart of the big city is a
good place to hide but not always this
bird probably has an alibi cooked up re-
gardless of his expectation that he can stay
clear he can prove an alibi better out
here on staten island where he can be in
an isolated spot than he could in the city
when as in this case it has to cover weeks
get me lets go
  late sunday afternoon jenkinss launch
chugged alongside a houseboat moored close
inshore at a dreary spot three miles below
port richmond
  there were five men on the houseboat
lounging about in the nondescript garb of
men having a good time two were in
bathing suits sitting with their feet dan-
gling in the water
  jenkins stopped alongside these two
from the upper deck the three others
looked down disinterestedly
  no word was spoken as jenkins stood
up fending off his launch his eyes jumped
from the three who in form bore no resem-
blance to the fugitive he gazed with benev-
olent smile but keenly at the two bathers
  both were lithely built and about the
height and weight he understood sallin to
be one was young in his twenties and
had fair hair the other about thirty-five
had hair shot with gray
red for a million

 the silence became strange the young-
 er man drew up his feet
  hello he said
 hello replied jenkins but he was
 looking at the other man
  sight-seeing said one of those aloft
 frivolously
 jenkins did not look up he glanced at
 his assistant who was sitting negligently
 jiggling a finger between the spokes of the
 steering wheel
  thats the guy said jenkins sudden-
 ly and he covered the graying haired man
 with a gun
 his aid pointed a gun at those on the
 upper deck
the man whom jenkins menaced
laughed
  if this is a hold-up he said  youll
 get damned little a couple of bottles of
 rum-the end of our perfect vacation-are
 the most valuable things aboard
 piracy the word came satirically
 from above  wheres your black flag old
 man
 all five laughed
 jenkins gazed on his man benignly he
 was unruffled by the hilarious reception ac-
 corded his gunplay
  im an officer he explained  i want
 you
 sure the wanted one was more
amused  what have i been doing he
flipped his toes in the water
  not much said jenkins  will you
 all come over to new york or do you
 have to be taken
  aw go to hell grinned another of the
 party good-naturedly  you dont want
 our hooch youve had enough
 jenkins ignored that  coming
 the man with the grayed hair bent to-
 ward him he frowned
  do you mean this foolishness he
 asked earnestly
  i do nodded jenkins
 but-
  well listen to the  buts  later on
 jenkinss voice crisped for a small man
 he looked uncommonly businesslike
  heusler is dead he added
 the information failed to get a rise the
 man he shot it at stared blankly
   do you mean that you accuse me of
murdering this-what did you sav his name
is
   no jenkins shook his head
   then what-
   if you cant figure it out said jenkins
drolly  the charge is bank robbery
  there was renewed laughter
   where when they chorused
  jenkins sighed  town of norford-
yesterday he explained patiently
   ive been here a month protested the
accused while his companions roared
 ive been on this boat-here-a month
youre crazy
   well let you prove that retorted jen-
kins  the sooner we get going the quick-
er you can prove it
  they went with him finally laughing
and kidding him their attitude was that
of humoring a nut they told him so
frankly and the least troubled of the
party was floyd sallin he had four wit-
nesses to make good his alibi
xix
  jenkins returned to norford with his
prisoner at midnight sunday at new
york police headquarters he had had sallin
finger printed and measured the records
were being searched there for a previous
arrest
  sallins four witnesses went with him
they had identified themselves satisfactori-
ly to the new york police jenkins had to
admit that there was nothing on them
they were reputable enough witnesses
whose word would go in court unless it
could be indubitably discredited they
insisted that sallin had been with them
during the three weeks on the houseboat
  sallin gave an address which was verified
he had lived there for two years the land-
lord affirmed and sallin had maintained
the small apartment that time he had
closed it to go on vacation a month back
neighbors confirmed that his occupation
-he had none he had some money and
helped out his income by gambling a little
  upon reaching norford jenkins learned
of others in the case taylor and odell
were prisoners they had been arrested by

argosy-allstory weekly
railroad detectives while riding the blind
the bag containing their share of the loot
they had cast away but the action had
been observed by the officers and it had
been recovered
  blakely the norford sleuth who was be-
ing restrained from arresting frank denton
and bessie wentworth only on the pleading
of trainor and others of the bank officials
was highly elated he claimed the credit
for the capture of taylor and odell-hadnt
he got out a fast alarm-and he scoffed at
jenkins when sallins alibi appeared to be
so well founded
   wheres the black-haired woman he
jeered  youll get her on a submarine
eh
  he couldnt see where jenkins had any-
thing to back up his contention that sallin
was among the robbers jenkins smiled at
him and said nothing he was awaiting the
coming of two men he had requested to fol-
low him from new york they had not
accompanied him because they were not at
home when he passed through the city
  sallin listened stolidly to the recital of
heuslers death he was taken to the
morgue and looked on the body without a
sign of recognition he looked stonily at
taylor and odell when they were brought
before him without warning
  bessie wentworth and frank denton
identified taylor and odell as having been
in the sallin household they looked
blankly at sallin and he looked as blankly
at them
  on jenkinss suggestion the muddy suits
of clothes found in the house were tried on
sallin taylor and odell they fitted
but that was inconsequential the tailors
labels had been removed a man could not
be convicted because a suit fitted him
  all this sallin submitted to without ob-
jection toward daybreak he yawned
   isnt that enough for one night he
smiled wanly he looked from jenkins to
the chief of police and the district attorney
 all my cards are on the table gentlemen
i was never in this town before i did not
rob the bank i have been with four friends
on the houseboat off staten island for the
last month you say the man you want
was here during the last three weeks i
cant be that man i can say no more than
that - offer no more proof than i have
given ive been decent with you because
you are trying to solve a big crime but
now  - he tapped the chiefs desk - i
want you to reciprocate i want a lawyer
and i want to be taken into court and dis-
charged
  the chief and the district attorney con-
ferred with jenkins he telephoned new
york
   the men im waiting for are on the
way he told the chief and the prosecutor
 they are chemists	
  the chief was worried sallin might
make trouble they were holding him
without evidence
  what dyou want chemists for he
questioned tartly
   havent you any idea
   none the chief disliked being kept
in the dark  what is it
   talk to bessie wentworth said jen-
kins dryly  ask her about the woman
  the chief snorted he had a profession-
al dislike for private detectives which was
not fully overcome by jenkinss unassum-
ing traits
   and oh jenkins imparted a piece of
information he had just received from his
office  weve got de real he has a
wad of fifty thousand dollars-and a knife
with fresh blood on it we got him pulling
out on a train for philadelphia and-
jenkins swapped grins with the now beam-
ing chief- did you happen to notice that
big clumsy ring on heuslers finger yes
we-ell-theres a ragged cut over de reals
eye that might have been made by that
ring theyre bringing him out here sal-
lin may know him
  jenkins was wrong there for sallin did
not know de real but that turned out to
be immaterial the chemists arrived be-
fore de real jenkins conferred with them
in private they were smiling broadly as
they came into the chiefs office and turned
their eyes on sallin
  he confronted these newcomers boldly
with the calmness that had marked him all
along yet he was obviously puzzled by
the introduction of the aged white-haired
man and the other stoop-shouldered and
red for a million

wearing horned glasses to sallin they ap-
peared as a new breed in police business
  they stood behind him they looked
at each other and chuckled jenkins had
put an original proposition up to them it
worked out
  together they nodded to jenkins
  from his pocket while his cheery eyes
sparkled he took a pair of hair-clippers
   if youll have somebody hold him
chief he invited  well cut his hair on
the left side and mark it as an exhibit
   his hair the chief rose out of his
chair in surprise he thought jenkins had
gone mad
  so did the others all except sallin
whose face wore a dawning wonder his
hands gripped together slowly as though
he would prevent their slightest expression
of his feelings but had not the power
   his hair-on the left side repeated
jenkins  and these gentlemen  - he
waved at the chemists- will find in it
traces of henna cant you see that its
reddish-when the woman weve yet to get
constantly leaned her head when he was
playing injured i told you chief said
jenkins with a note almost of apology  to
ask bessie wentworth about the woman
  while they crowded round with many
amazed ejaculations to gape at his hair
sallin relaxed his eyes narrowed and he
smiled with tight lips he nodded to jen-
kins
   youre a wonder little man he said
without too much bravado but with rare
nerve  but-you make me laugh
   mebbe so said jenkins  mebbe-
the
   the phone rang the chief took it up
 new york police headquarters was calling
 his head wagged as to a rhythm while he
 listened and his brief replies were alive with
 joy he set down the phone with a semi-
 flourish
    theyve made you sallin in the gal-
 lery in new york your picture and your
 fingers from the time you were in on sus-
 picion for the bank job in michigan
 member and-
   sallins face became drawn and he
 straightened for the blow
    and they have violas picture from the
 same time weve got you by the hair
 he laughed at his own joke  and when
 we get her well identify her with witnesses
 and you with her wheres the cash sal-
 lin
    checked at the ferryhouse at st
 george said jenkins softly  i was sav-
 ing that until his red hair was tagged that
 was a mistake sallin added the little de-
 tective with something like regret  a job
 like you pulled spoiled by a red-head
 there wasnt a thing to take you on if that
 dope didnt work and if we hadnt got
 you to headquarters we wouldnt know who
 the ex-red-head is would we shes black
 as a raven now isnt she sallin that
 indigo in the wash-basin-
   floyd sallin laughed
    little man he said  you have too
 many brains for your size
   he had achieved his dream-a million
 dollars in one haul-had excelled it by half
 a million and he had lost in the winning
 through the red-head that he had made

 meets prince nicholas the prince finds her charming and makes love to her jenny loses her
 heart to him her visit to argar castle is cut short by the return of the real archduchess
chapter viii
           at the meet
nicholas almer frederick
 charles honors hereditary
 prince of galmatia prince of gan-
 dolo overlord of the transmontine
 marshes and duke of the lerinnean is-
 lands-to give him only a few of his names
 -awoke on that saturday morning in the
 state bedchamber at argar castle very much
 pleased with himself and the world in gen-
 eral
 as he stood and shaved his handsome
 chin and upper lip before an imperial look-
 ing glass brought from the capital of rose-
 mark by special permission of the republic
              thit itory began in the argosy-allttory weekly for november 

 long established in that country he looked
 forward to an engrossing day
   he was as we have seen most pleasur-
 ably surprised by the personality of the
 bride he had found in this ancient kentish
 castle
  the young man was something of an
enigma whether he was really as frivolous
and casual as he seemed to be even his
mother would have found it hard to tell
his serious moments were too rare to chron-
icle suffice it to say that he had a charm
of manner that won all hearts that he had
been personally indulged from childhood
but at the same time trained to perform his
public duties to the very best of his ability
   this marriage had been a case in point
another womans life

he must marry he had been told in vain
he pointed out that other princes belonging
to far more important countries had delayed
their marriages until they were many years
older than he things were different he
was told he was the only son there were
elements in the country and its administra-
tion that made his early marriage impera-
tive the next heir was highly unpopular
with the people and so on his cousin
hortense of mangora luckily for him had
died he was little more than a boy when
that alliance had been proposed then
came the choice of the princess caroline of
hisperia-she of the cod fish eyes he had
put his foot down in vain his mother had
argued with him in her jolly sporting way
it simply wasnt to be done
  then after an interval of three years
during which his country was at war and he
and his father were at the front and every
moment meant danger to the succession the
archduchess stephanie of rosemark was
brought to his notice negotiations had
been undertaken the ex-empress was
agreeable england  gave her unqualified
approval the archduchess was not of a
reigning family but the bluest blood in the
world ran in her veins including that of the
plantagenets of the bourbons and of mary
stuart
  nicholas had learned things during the
war he was more amenable the arch-
duchesss photograph was shown to him
he sighed shrugged his shoulders and
gave in
  and really there was no hardship about
it that was the delightful surprise short
of choosing ones own wife nothing could
be better there was the little sting she
had been chosen for him his mind played
queer tricks as he deliberately set himself
to picture what would have happened if he
had not been himself and she had not been
herself and they had met-just like any
other ordinary pair
  to-day was going to crown the pleasant
week he was an ardent horseman himself
and the thought of that sweet and surpris-
ingly lovely girl in the saddle was a rarely
stimulating one
  the archduchess did not appear at break-
fast
  he found that a dozen or more of the
household were in hunting kit he did not
wear the english pink himself but the bot-
tle green and buff facings of his own home
hunt
  stephanie was already mounted when he
first saw her surrounded by members of
the household and by certain neighbors in-
vited to start from the castle to the picker-
ing cross where the meet was to be held
  she sat her sixteen hand bay mare with
the white blaze like a feather riding side
saddle wearing a plain dark habit and a
hard felt hat a glance at her hands satis-
fied him a more workmanlike figure he
had never seen
  but-by st melchior why was she more
made up than ever and for the hunting
field and was it the hard hat that made
her lovely face look harder
  he rode to her side saluting her
   good morning stephanie
   good morning stephanie replied
 were in for a grand day
  just then a move was made stephanie
leading and he falling in beside her what
was it about a horse that made a woman
look  horsey  he could have sworn that
she was a little changed her voice even
had sounded harsher and she didnt seem
to want to be alone with him she kept
in the middle of a bunch of people all the
way to the place of the meet
  there was a crowd of country people at
the first covert side there was some de-
lay and then the covert was drawn the
hounds went away everything was forgot-
ten in the business of the day
  nicholas and stephanie were in the first
flight of a gloriously long run his admira-
tion grew no fence was too big for her
she wanted no one to give her a lead she
fled the much swollen pickering brook as if
a puff of wind wafted her over it she was
unheated unruffled when after a grand kill
they halted to eat sandwiches and give their
horses a breathing space before going on to
the next covert
  dismounted she made a perfect picture
and nicholas felt his heart give a great
bound as he walked up to her
  stephanie youre truly a marvel
whod think you could ride like that

argosy-allstory weekly
   why not she asked
   of course ive always heard about
you he said quickly  but what ive seen
of you hardly made me expect it
   why there was an unmistakably
mocking note in her voice
  he gave her a swift look what was the
change in her she was just the same to
look at except that her beautiful hair was
hidden by the hard hat only a few burnt-
golden tendrils escaped in the nape of her
neck the rouge and lip salve added to
the sharp wind made her face less tenderly
soft her brown eyes seemed to have lost
some of their fascinating questions
   i dont know he said  you seemed
different before- he looked around him
the field was discreetly dispersed their
suites were at a respectful distance he
and stephanie were practically alone
  out of some inner unexplained perplexity
came his next words
   stephanie this morning you dont seem
a bit the girl who kissed me last night
   dont i she laughed softly enough
but again with a hint of mockery  my
dear nicholas are we ever the same in the
morning as we were-last night
  he had spoken with rare sincerity her
tone stung him he offered her a sandwich
and said with an infinitely cool smile
   ive heard people say that the hunting
field spoils the most charming woman i
think they must be right
chapter ix
the other stephanie
as the day wore on prince nicholas was
destined to receive several disagree-
able little shocks in connection with
his future bride
  they had another kill after a short run
and then a long point of more than seven
miles over the springy turf of the high
downs and through the gorse where hounds
were checked and scent gave out another
neighboring covert was drawn without re-
sult and then there was the long trot
home after an essentially satisfactory day
as to the weather it was a day to raise the
spirits sky high and make the heart sing
  after the second kill nicholas had an-
other short conversation with stephanie
who this time remained mounted the way
she sat her horse entranced him it was the
very essence of grace of youth of fearless-
ness she was indeed a dazzling horse-
woman but there was still that change in
her demeanor that something less simple
less tender less girlish more provocative
he was moved to answer her little mocking
sallies on the occasion when he said that
he believed the hunting field spoiled many
women he was all but rude he was an-
gry with himself for that but could not
help it
  what a double-faced girl she must be
last night all surrender all sweetness this
morning offhand and cool with a hint of
gay mockery in those velvet brown eyes
also it might almost be said that she
spurned his company and deliberately kept
in the midst of her suite
  but toward the end of the day as they
jogged down the lane that led into the main
road and the entrance gates of argar castle
nicholas managed to attach himself to her
side and the other riders fell discreetly
away
   we must make an opportunity for a
little chat again this evening he said
 its my last evening stephanie i have
to leave before dinner to-morrow
   isnt there a dance or something on
she asked carelessly  i saw an army of
workmen unloading millions of roses and
carnations this morning
   oh yes of course well we shall get
a chance of being alone do you love
dancing stephanie but of course you
do
   of course i do but its frightfully
stiff and formal here you know nicholas
if you and i want to dance a waltz it will
have to be the old-fashioned viennese kind
mostly its all quadrilles and things of that
kind they bore me to death
  he could not stop wondering about the
change in her where was the girl he had
held in his arms the girl whose eyes had
been wet with the deep wild emotions that
had stirred him too where was the girl
who had tremblingly asked him if it was
only a piece of luck to him they had been
another womans life

brought together by reasons of state had
he offended her no he knew he had not
done that at least he had given her no
reasonable cause of offense
   stephanie he asked again  why are
you so different to-day have i done any-
thing to hurt you i cant understand how
you can change so youre hardly nice
to me-hardly polite and last night you
cried in my arms
  she gave a little impatient laugh
   good gracious nicholas we all make
fools of ourselves sometimes dont rub
last night in so heavily we shall get on all
right
  so she was just a cold-hearted capricious
flirt there was no other explanation his
hostility was roused no young man likes
being made a fool of but nicholas of gal-
matia less than most
  he laughed too
   oh ive no doubt we shall get on all
right i hope youll be good enough to give
me one of those decorous viennese waltzes
stephanie as ive told you before were
not nearly so stiff or meticulously formal
in my country youll have a much livelier
time
  thank goodness for that she ex-
claimed and touched her horse with her
crop cfnd bounded through the wide open
castle gates and up the great avenue
nicholas piqued and ruffled did not follow
  if this was to be her attitude-well two
could play at any game
  her pale eyes screwed up with anxiety
and her thin lips quivering with suspense
the baroness dora luini awaited her young
mistress in the orange and gold sitting room
of the archduchesss apartments
   your imperial highness - does the
prince guess she asked hardly able to
frame the words for anxiousness
   i dont believe he does stephanie re-
plied with a rather wicked little smile
 but my dear old luini he must it can
only be a matter of time unless hes half
witted this was no test its when were
alone your little substitute seems to
have made the running with him he talks
of kisses and tears and doesnt understand
why i dont gaze at him in adoration
thats obvious i must say hes wickedly
good looking too
   but-your imperial highness i told
you how simple and quiet she was 
   i know i didnt let you down luini
dear really i was quite nice to him but
i couldnt fall into his arms i must avoid
a tete-a-tete after all he goes to-morrow
and when we meet again hell have forgot-
ten the impression she made on him im
not coming down to tea excuse me to the
all highest will you luini im dog tired
but before the baroness left the room
stephanie flung a question at her
   i say is she really so awfully like me
its rather quaint i dont believe the
prince has the slightest suspicion
  the baroness gave the royal lady the
same intent scrutiny she had often given
jenny devon during her brief stay at the
castle
   it would really be almost impossible to
tell you apart your imperial highness i
am amazed myself its only a little some-
thing in the expression and in the voice
   ive talked like a peal of muffled bells
all day said stephanie with a laugh
then her voice took on a carelessly good
natured tone  i say luini i am a nui-
sance to you arent i
   nothing matters now that your imperial
highness has come back retorted the loyal
lady with a deep sigh
  prince nicholas found at dinner that the
archduchess was keeping up her new pose
whereas before she had been modest and
quiet and self-effacing in company with her
family and relatives and the exalted guests
to-night she was simply wooden and unin-
terested he noticed it particularly in the
ex-empresss little sitting room where they
spent half an hour after dinner the arch-
duchess sat stiff and bored there was
something almost sullen about her her
deep curtsy seemed purely formal and im-
plied no real respect she moved like an
automaton during the stately dances at the
beginning of the ball
  but she looked-she looked like a rose
herself among the thousands of exquisite
blooms that lined the ballroom she wore
cloudy rose color and the splendid string of

argosy-allstory weekly
pearls and a strange arrangement of rose
gold-dusted feathers that made her little
proud head look as though it had wings
  and she danced-she danced like a god-
dess she danced like she rode-as if air
were her element and not earth
  nicholas found that out when he waltzed
with her it was a disconcerting job in that
eitquette ridden ballroom a glittering
company stood around never surely were
there so many gorgeous jewels displayed
on so many women who wore them to the
manner born a ridiculously small space at
the upper end of the room was available
and one danced with officers of the house-
hold guarding the four corners as if one were
a pair of professionals at a night club the
cynosure of all eyes but even then with
such a partner the poise of her body the
sway of her hips the gossamer lightness of
her footing-it was the most rapturously
enjoyable exercise in the world
  later there was general dancing the
older members of the imperial family had
withdrawn nicholas found stephanie in
conversation with one of his gentlemen
and having had a word with the band-
master and finding a waltz in progress for
the general company he got hold of her
and masterfully without a word bore her
off and through one of the rose arched door-
ways perilously intoxicatingly dancing
down a flight of steps into one of the great
corridors
  it was a breathless performance and at
the end of it with light fingers he touched
her cheek
   still all this powder and paint little
girl he said he was a trifle carried away
by her nearness by her overwhelming beau-
ty  after what i said
  good lord stephanie cried mr
puritan what on earth is the matter you
should see what a sight i look without it
  this instead of the confused modesty of
a night ago then she had murmured that
everybody did it and she had said that
he had not offended her
  she roused something fierce and auto-
cratic in him he suddenly felt that he
wanted to crush this impudent new spirit
after all she was the same girl
  they were right at the end of the corri-
dor nobody was near the distant music
was like some half remembered love song
her beauty fired him he took her in his
arms perhaps a little roughly
   stephanie little girl you cant keep
this up youre playing with me youre
trying to you little idiot but you cant
you cant
  he covered her face with kisses the
subtle perfume of her powder-the baroness
had not forgotten that touch-stole over
him his head was high and proud he
would make her be the little girl of last
night she couldnt help herself
  she could help herself it seemed she
pushed him away her little hands were
hard she was breathing fast furiously
  a little sound of rage was in her throat
she ran from him fleet as a deer she
fled him just in the same way as she had
fled the pickering brook on her glorious
bay mare as if a puff of wind were bearing
her away
  he saw her no more that night he
stayed with the general company for a little
while dancing enthusiastically when he
left the ballroom many a bright slightly
wistful feminine glance followed him
  the next day being sunday there were
two elaborate services in the chapel
  there were guests to luncheon afterward
and prince nicholas had no opportunity
of seeing stephanie alone during the meal
she complained of a headache soon after-
ward she disappeared and at tea time the
baroness dora luini brought a message to
the prince to the effect that her imperial
highness was feeling so indisposed that she
was obliged to retire and greatly regretted
being unable to take leave of his royal high-
ness in person
  at six oclock nicholas left for the
coast by motor car
  when the castle had settled down again
the baroness dora luini went to the arch-
duchesss apartments and asked to be re-
ceived
  stephanie lounged on the settee in her
sitting room clad in a wonderful wrapper of
flame satin and sable reading a letter she
flashed her wicked little smile at her lady
in waiting
another womans life

  this is delicious she exclaimed
 your little substitute has caught the
young gentlemans fancy and no mistake
my good luini he doesnt like me
read
  she tossed the letter over it fell on the
floor and the baroness picked it up
   you kind and unkind girl she read in
a small rather cramped but very pretty
handwriting- good-by please wear my
ring and be your sweet self and not your
prickly one when i come back devoted-
ly nicholas
   how did your imperial highness be-
have to him asked the baroness anxious-
ly  are you perfectly sure he suspects
nothing
   not as far as i know luini stephanie
replied she frowned slightly  it was
rather difficult for me i wasnt prepared
i shall know the next time that girl didnt
lose any time did she she laughed with
lightly contemptuous amusement
   your imperial highness knows-the be-
trothal is to be announced at once said
the lady in waiting as she returned the
princes note
   is it well heres the ring she held
out an ivory case lined with crushed white
velvet
   oh gasped the baroness her breath
taken away by the magnificent gem-a
pigeons blood ruby of oval shape and un-
usual size set in a rim of seven other
rubies of equal splendor and fire  isnt
it wonderful what a ring your impe-
rial highness must wear it at once
   i suppose i must said stephanie
slipping it onto her finger  luini when
is the prince coming back
   not for another month so i understand
from her majesty
   thank goodness for that
   then the contracts and settlements will
be ready to be signed there will be the
court ball in london and a banquet in your
highnesss and the princes honor and a
luncheon in the city when the prince will
receive the freedom and other public ar-
rangements the prince is expected to stay
a fortnight i believe and then he will not
come back again until the wedding
  the archduchess said nothing in reply
she held up her hand with the ring on it
and examined its rose colored fire with
an unreadable light in her lovely eyes
chapter x
heartache
with the instinct of a wounded ani-
mal jenny devon had slipped back
into her old fourth floor back room
in bloomsbury she saw no reason why she
should seek new lodging
  her landlady like mine lacour thought
she had taken a job in rome she had
actually had time to get to the italian
capital spend a few days there and re-
turn
  she announced that she had not liked
the work or the people her landlady wel-
comed her back a nice quiet lodger who
gave no trouble she gave her baked beans
for supper on the first night because she
knew she liked them and jenny ate them
with relish and wondered if the gold plate
and the thousand candlelights and the won-
derfully seasoned dishes and the delicate
wines and the hothouse fruit of argar castle
had been nothing but a dream
  she was a sensible girl and she knew
that she must take up her life again she
must think of those days as if they were
a dream she must not think of the prince
at all he had now met his real bride
either he would be deceived and think her
the same girl or if he wasnt the thing
would be explained and he would under-
stand and forget all about it
  jenny realized that royalties might have
two lives very widely differing one from
the other anyhow as the real archduchess
denied that she had gone away with an-
other man but simply out of caprice it
would probably not be long before she fell
in love with prince nicholas and he was
already on the road to being in love with
her
  jenny fought with her tears that first
night she felt so insignificant so unwant-
ed a lone peri cast out of paradise she
awoke in the middle of the night and cried
softly to herself for an hour
on the sunday she went to see bertie

argosy-allstory weekly
bearing her usual gifts she had a few
pounds-enough to live on for about a cou-
ple of weeks she must begin to look for
work at once
  bertie grumbled because she had not
come last sunday she told him she had
been away he said everybody else had
had visitors he had been ill she looked
at his drawn fretful face with loving com-
passion
  but she could do nothing it seemed
impossible to help bertie to-day she had
brought chocolates and he was pining for
acid drops she had brought his favorite
comic papers and his eyes hurt him so
that he could not even look at the pictures
it was a dreary day gray with every now
and then a drizzle of rain jennys spirit
was steeped in gloom the omnibus put
her down in the heart of the west end
she had nothing to do the thought of
her back room was most uninviting she
could not look up anybody she knew she
had not collected herself sufficiently to be
able to answer questions
  she saw a cue in front of a cinema me-
chanically she fell in with it a famous star
was appearing in a film of circus life it
would distract her mind she felt utterly
disheartened her thoughts went round and
round in a circle and always they came
back to this that she would never see
prince nicholas again
  a short film was just ending as she took
her seat in the crowded auditorium the
lights went up for a moment then down
again as the screen announced that the
topical news pictures would be shown
there was a rally of boy scouts the arrival
of an african chief at liverpool and then
some words appeared that made jennys
heart beat with fearful excitement
meet of the argar vale royal
followers
  and then to the tune of  john peel
the meet that had been her last rendezvous
with prince nicholas was shown and a
young man and a young woman on horse-
back amid a crowd of others
 his royal highness prince nicholas of
galmatia  was flashed on the screen  and
her imperial highness the archduchess
stephanie of rosemark whose engagement
it is understood will shortly be announced
there was another picture of the two iso-
lated at a covert side the orchestra played
a sentimental air the prince a handsome
and gallant figure was seen to dismount
and approach the archduchess looking up
at her all smiles and offering her a sand-
wich
  a woman next to jenny exclaimed  no
doubt about their being in love do you
think
  and her companion another woman an-
swered fervently  i should think not
and no wonder arent they a handsome
pair
  and then yet another picture as they
hacked backed to the castle quite alone
their horses very close together and from
the audience a burst of sympathetic ap-
plause
  jenny gulped down something in her
throat that threatened to choke her he
was already falling in love with stephanie
she could hardly bear it how that girl
sat her horse to jenny she looked a
scornful insolent figure
  the princes words to her spoken only
two nights ago rang in her ears  stepha-
nie just think it wont be long before i
shall take you to my own country-as my
wife
  and now he was saying this same thing
to another girl
  she crouched in her seat of the circus
film she saw nothing at all she could not
keep back her tears and the kindly dark-
ness hid them
  monday morning she received a small
registered parcel on opening it two jewel
cases were displayed one held a beautiful
string of pearls not large or magnificent
but such as a girl might wear and have
them supposed to be imitation by the world
they had been chosen with thought the
other gift was more difficult to place it
was a flexible bracelet of the very finest
workmanship made of diamonds inter-
spersed with brilliant brownish yellow to-
pazes the stones were large the diamonds
obviously of the very first water it was
a dazzling ornament and quite unsuited to
                         a
another womans life

a girl in jennys position she knew it must
be exceedingly valuable
  there was a plain card in the package
and on it some one had written  with
much gratitude
  she would not take money so they had
sent her jewels they were proud and
would not accept her services for nothing
they must pay her for those hours that
now she looked back on them filled her
with a sense of incalculable loss not the
gold plate the roses and the white and
silver bed but that presence with the
laughing eyes and the tender voice that
brilliant personality that had just stretched
out a careless hand and robbed her of her
heart they thought they could pay her
for those days
  her first impulse was to return the jew-
els but thinking it over she decided to
keep them she would wear the pearls
and lock the diamond bracelet away
they had been given in kindness she was
sure every one at argar castle had been
most kind to her she bore them no
grudge it was only that they could not
understand
  she went out and bought a newspaper
and began to look through the advertise-
ment columns for work she would not go
back to mme lacours for all sorts of rea-
sons she must try other establishments
it seemed that very few manikins were
wanted she tried bluesprays and the very
exclusive establishment known as  la
maison rouge she had no luck neither
had any vacancy although the managers of
both houses looked at her with more than
common interest as soon as a vacancy oc-
curred they would communicate with miss
devon if she were still at liberty would
she leave her address seeing a sign up
in a small shop in bond street she present-
ed herself there the proprietress a smart
society lady offered her three pounds a
week and it appeared that she would have
to do practically the whole work of the
showroom as well as perform her manikins
duties
  she was disheartened as she went out
having refused the place she was more dis-
heartened still after an afternoon and an-
other morning spent in seeking work sev-
   a
eral big shops offered her a post at a ridicu-
lously low wage she did not want to give
mme lacour as reference she dreaded
inquiries into her supposed journey to
rome she was strictly loyal to the people
to whom she had rendered her fantastic ser-
vice
  but she had to live there were ber-
ties expenses he needed clothes the
matron had said a wage of three pounds
would mean that she would have to leave
her present lodging she had learned none
of the technical branches of dressmaking
in her spare time at mme lacours she had
helped the girls sometimes to make bead
embroideries and such things but she had
no real skill or gift for such work she
could do nothing but what she had been
doing
  panic began to seize her berties ex-
penses had to be paid week by week she
could sell the diamond bracelet but she was
terrified lest she should have to explain how
it came into her possession
  five days passed in her search for work
she would not be able to live much longer
she had had to send some things to the
home for bertie she went back to the
bond street shop to take the post at three
pounds a week but of course it was filled
she understood by now that none of the
first class establishments were taking on
fresh manikins until they began to see how
the season was going to turn out there
was nothing for it but to take on a job in
one of the big shops-an irreparable loss of
caste
  on the day of this decision she happened
upon mr phare in bond street he greet-
ed her in his quiet voice while his eager
steely blue eyes showed concern as well as
admiration
   you are not looking well miss devon
i hope there is nothing wrong
   i am quite well thank you mr phare
jenny replied in a stiff little voice
   i was afraid something had happened
to you-after you left lacours
   how do you know ive left lacours
she asked in astonishment
   i heard it from lady grace i was
inquiring after you you must know that
i take a great interest in you miss devon

argosy-allstory weekly
   you are very kind mr phare but
there is nothing the matter with me i as-
sure you
  she was not so much on the defensive as
usual and when he asked her to lunch
with him she found herself accepting she
was very tired and hungry she had very
little money in her purse and she was
thoroughly depressed there was some-
thing soothing in the mans obvious sym-
pathy tendered as it was with simple friend-
liness she did not stop to think what had
happened the time before
  at the very beginning of the meal an
untoward incident happened a waiter
knocked jennys hand bag off the table
it was an old one and the insecure fas-
tening gave way emptying its contents on
the carpet
  marcus phare stooped to pick it up as
it happened jenny had brought the dia-
mond and topaz bracelet with her not in
its case but wrapped in tissue paper she
had been trying to make up her mind to sell
it or perhaps pawn it this was saturday
and on the next day she had to take berties
money to the home
  the paper became unwrapped and mar-
cus phare lifted the glittering thing from
the floor with the other humble contents of
jennys bag her powder puff some keys
and her almost empty purse he looked
at her very hard as he said carelessly
   how very pretty he examined the
bracelet  and what perfect stones old
brazilian ive never seen finer and i
know something about diamonds
  jenny felt herself growing red to the
roots of her hair his tone might have
meant nothing at all but she read into it
a meaning that outraged her feelings
  she took the jewels from his hand with-
out a word and thrust it back into the
bag
   it does not belong to me she said
coldly not caring a pin about the lie in
fact in that moment she felt that it did
not belong to her-that it never could
    was wondering said phare  who
was the lucky person privileged to give you
such a pretty thing i think you know i
covet the honor
  she faced him with angry eyes and his
kindled into flame as they rested on her
lovely face
   something has happened to you he
murmured and then he changed his tone
and played the agreeable host
  jenny ate so that she need not talk
marcus phare was most entertaining he
knew everybody and he had that slightly
detached slightly cynical manner of the
rich bachelor courted by society
   i would like you to see my house he
said toward the end of the meal  wont
you let me take you there now its only
round the corner-in charles street i have
some nice pictures
   thank you very much she answered
 but i cant i have an appointment
   then another day wont you come
to tea-to-morrow
   im afraid i cant
   youre rather unkind arent you
why did you come to lunch with me you
cant hate me altogether you must know
my feelings i am very much interested in
you you and i might be great friends i
should love to show you the world-the real
world i would love to show you monte
carlo and rome and the desert why
dont you let me for a girl with your
face to show off other womens dresses is
monstrous its a crime wouldnt you
like to have lots of things like that pretty
bangle that you say doesnt belong to you
i suppose its a clients and youre going
to pawn it for her i hear that you girls
are asked to do all sorts of funny things
 please mr phare i would rather you
didnt talk like this jenny said she put
down her half smoked cigarette and quickly
gulped down her coffee  i must be going
now she began to pull on her gloves
   dont be absurd he said  theres
heaps of time i dont want to frighten
you little girl but i cant bear to see you
throwing your life away like this-your
wonderful youth why dont you trust me
i know what life ought to be like to a girl
like you i might-even marry you
she went white to the lips and sprang
to her feet she saw only the odious impli-
cation in his generous proposal no doubt
the man thought it a magnificent promise
to hold out to a girl of her class
another womans life

   im going she said under her breath
 please dont follow me i never want to
see you again as long as i live

once more
the next day jenny took all the money
she had but a few shillings to the
home bertie was weak he had had
a slight fever the last few nights as
soon as it was warmer the doctor wanted
him to go for a few weeks to an affiliated
institution by the sea that would cost
more money
  jenny was in despair
  on monday morning she ran into mme
lacour in oxford street the dressmaker
stopped dead and gazed at her furiously
and was about to move on when she
changed her mind
   you did not stay long in rome miss
devon she said coldly
   no madame i did not like it the girl
answered
   oh it was not such an improvement
as you thought it would be on my humble
establishment the frenchwoman cried
 are you working now
   no
  madame had a high temper she gave
jenny the benefit of it she was ungrate-
ful stupid just like the english and all
the rest of it then she offered to take her
back
   it is entirely because of the arch-
duchess we are getting on with the trous-
seau she will probably be displeased if
you are not there when next she comes i
have written to ask for a visit next week
she noticed you and you certainly do look
something like her you dont deserve it
but you can come back if you like
  jenny played for time to think she
wanted to go back but she darent decide
at once it was just that-the archduchess
could she bear to stand before her pos-
turing in the clothes made for the royal
lady could she meet the baronesss eyes
could she carry it off she wanted to go
back it would be like going home if only
it werent for that
  she said she would let madame know to-
morrow she had almost arranged to take
on another post oh these lies-how she
hated them
  madame went off grumbling at her in-
gratitude but very much pleased all the
same
  at her lodging jenny found the baroness
dora luini
  her face was a picture of anxiety
   i have come to fetch you she said
 you must come back with me at once
thank heaven i have found you here
the archduchess has gone again
   gone again echoed jenny
   yes oh the wicked girl the cruel
girl can you imagine such behavior her
majesty is beside herself i have never seen
her so agitated last time was nothing to
this and she is ninety-two i am terrified
for her we thought it was all right the
archduchess was brought back she swore
count saxt had nothing to do with it we
know that she lied she has hoodwinked
us she came back to gain time prince
nicholas suspected nothing he did not see
much of her
   we were grateful to you our minds
were quite at rest and now she has gone
again she went on saturday-slipped out
of the castle without any one knowing
and we had a wire this morning that she
and count saxt passed through paris on
sunday its from the best informed source
that young man is as wicked as she is
it seems that he got permission to go to
the bedside of a sick relative in the con-
fusion of the archduchesss first flight the
empress was not told about it the person
died and he did not come back immediate-
ly and the empress who is very strict about
etiquette sent word to him that he must not
return there was no truth in that report
that he was with the archduchess in venice
but they must have planned it all and
now theres no doubt about it-theyve gone
away together
   i-oh i am sorry exclaimed jenny
   you will come back with me
  i cant i really cant
   you must it wont be for long again
-i assure you this person who saw them
has gone in pursuit by this time and the

argosy-allstory weekly
other person who brought her back before
started yesterday that person can influ-
ence her when no one else can i told you
before you saw that she came back she
will come back again you wont fail us my
dear you cant be so cruel so heartless
 you dont understand jenny mur-
mured  it is too difficult-too impossi-
ble
   i know no one knows better but
you have done it once
  jenny looked at the nervously working
face in a dazed wounded way
   but just now it cant matter give me
a little time the prince has gone back
he wasnt to be here again for some time-
you told me
   i know said the baroness faintly
 but that is just it he is coming back-
at once a letter came for stephanie this
morning he has put off all sorts of en-
gagements and is coming back to the castle
he has invited himself he will be here
to-morrow night
chapter xii
with the prince
once more within the walls of argar
castle jenny stood by the window
of the archduchesss orange and gold
sitting room and wondered why she had
consented to come back now that prince
nicholass arrival was only a matter of two
or three hours she felt more anxious even
than she had done the first time she knew
the pitfalls that awaited her ignorance had
really been a safeguard it had made her
natural
  she asked herself why she had come
back was it because the baroness had
pleaded so passionately perhaps partly
was it because she had been so savagely
wounded in her womans soul and in her
self-esteem by what marcus phare had
dared to say to her perhaps partly but
really she knew why because she had
to come back because the prince was
coming back-coming back to her be-
cause he wanted to see her so badly that
he had put off all his engagements and was
returning at once it was not stephanie of
rosemark he wanted so badly to see again
no no-the letters proved that it was not
stephanie it was jenny devon the hum-
ble manikin
  the baroness had given her the princes
letters jenny knew them all by heart
the one that he had written in farewell
when he sent his ring-the glorious ruby
that now glowed rosily on jennys own
hand he had asked her to be her sweet self
when he returned and not her prickly one
evidently stephanie had not been nice to
him and the second written from gal-
matia after his return in answer to hers
thanking him for the ring
  he had called hers a prim little note
but he was glad she liked the ring evi-
dently stephanie had written formally he
had told her that the big ruby was his-
torical supposed to have been taken from
the crown of charlemagne he signed
himself hers sincerely  nicholas p but
the third letter she had kissed over and over
again when she was left alone at night in
that the prince wrote  i am coming back
you unkind girl i cant forget your un-
kindness you see im giving you an op-
portunity of being nice again please let me
find the little girl of the little room with
the china cabinets and not the cross prin-
cess of the ballroom and the hunting field
  it was to her to jenny devon that he
was coming back those words proved it
and jenny felt as guilty at her own return
as if she were not doing the imperial family
the greatest service in the world
  they had returned yesterday afternoon
the first thing had been to give a sitting
to a photographer who had come to take
portraits of the archduchess in the tem-
porary studio with its brilliant lighting
jenny posed for more than half an hour to
the satisfaction of the artist who it ap-
peared had never had the honor of making
pictures of her imperial highness before
  she had seen the empress for a few min-
utes the old lady had given her her won-
derful unfaded smile and thanked her for
coming back she looked tired and dined
in her own apartments so did jenny with
the baroness in attendance she spent the
whole morning with the baroness
  the lady in waiting discoursed on the em-
another womans life

presss wonderful character her body was
as frail as a wild rose leaf but her spirit
was indomitable until her husbands death
she had only been known as a peerless beau-
ty and a somewhat frivolous one at that
according to contemporary gossip but she
had developed into a wonderful woman of
business she managed everything in her
enormous household down to the smallest
details she knew every head of stock on
her farms she knew how much sugar was
used every day in the castle her estates
were model ones her farms were hugely
prosperous she ruled as an autocrat but
she had never done any one an injustice
and she tended her servants with her own
hands when they were sick
  jenny learned other interesting and curi-
ous things that the ex-empress possessed
the most valuable jewels in the world and
that they were all kept in the castle and
she wore them constantly that she always
slept with a loaded revolver by her side
that all the laundry of the castle was sent
over to boulogne to be washed and to paris
to be ironed and that certain of her ma-
jestys more personal articles of linen trav-
eled as far as a village in the south of
france where lived a woman almost as old
as she was who had been her personal
laundress when she sat on her throne con-
sequently she possessed enough household
linen to stock a town and all the elaborate
cyphers and the imperial crowns on the
sheets and towels and pillow cases were em-
broidered in irish convents also that every
single day of her life she descended to the
crypt under the chapel and laid fresh flow-
ers on her husbands and sons tombs
  the empress was devoted to animals and
there were some rare specimens in the wilder
parts of the grounds she especially loved
dogs and they were to be met on every side
and were allowed everywhere but there
was not a cat in the castle instant dis-
missal would be the penalty for any one
who introduced a member of the feline
tribe
  it was after five oclock in the afternoon
from the window jenny looked straight
across the great grass drives of the park
stretching as far as her eyes could see be-
tween the clumps of enormous old chestnut
trees and giant elms where the deer browsed
in the warm red rays of the sun about to
set
  the baroness came into the room jenny
turned
   good heavens how white you look
the elder woman exclaimed
   i feel sick with fright the girl said
 i cant see how the prince can take me
for the archduchess i simply dread his
first sight of me what will happen if he
knows i am a fraud
   you mustnt think of such a thing my
dear it only upsets you
   but if he does know
   we shall have to explain said the
baroness evidently anxious to soothe her
 but its not at all likely he had no sus-
picion about the archduchess i have told
you he saw very little of her you must
put some color on your cheeks
   the prince told me he hated it jenny
said
   i daresay he told the archduchess
too but she wouldnt take any notice of
that
   therefore i mustnt
   exactly you must remember that-
that- she hesitated
   that i am only a substitute there
was more bitterness in jennys voice than
she knew
   my dear i am thinking of you as much
as of any one else the baroness said
hastily  perhaps it would be as well not
to make yourself too attractive i hardly
know how to put it-
  you mean that i might fall in love with
the prince the girl exclaimed
   he certainly might very easily fall in
love with you was the retort  you see
the archduchess is rather offhand in her
manner he evidently noticed a difference
-you can see that in his letters he
thought her capricious i am inclined to
think it would be better to take that line
for-for both your sakes she concluded
rather lamely
  jenny understood the hint the prince
must have referred to something that had
passed between them to the archduchess
who had repeated it to her lady in waiting
no doubt in mockery jenny was beginning

argosy-allstory weekly
to hate the archduchess why was she so
foolish as to do this for her it wasnt
fair to ask her to she mustnt forget that
she was the humble little manikin oh no
she mustnt presume to imagine that the
prince could fall in love with her or that
she might allow herself to care for him
everything he said to her was meant for
his future wife
  it was in a mood of miserable revolt
that she was arrayed for dinner in a won-
derful golden gown with a wreath of small
golden roses in her hair that a pope had
once given to one of the archduchesss an-
cestresses in the days when popes went
about in society and entertained sumptuous-
ly in the vatican not even scorning hunt-
ing parties and masquerades
   it isnt fair she repeated to herself
it isnt fair
  she was in the empresss sitting room with
the other members of the family when
prince nicholas came in his eyes sought
hers at once laughing bright with excite-
ment she found herself flushing painfully
she could have sunk through the floor in
the agonized suspense of that first moment
  he bent over her hand murmuring his
conventional greetings she bowed and re-
plied mechanically
  the ex-empress annexed him talking
much more familiarly than usual per-
haps beneath that exquisite manner there
was a hint of anxiety too it was a game
of incredible boldness that they were all
playing her majesty rallied him playfully
on his prompt return inquired after his
family and made him describe the beauties
of the early spring in his southern land
  at dinner the places were differently ar-
ranged the prince sat on the empresss
right and jenny on the archduke gabriels
left with one of the princes gentlemen on
her other side he was young and very
ready to talk the table was of a flattened
horseshoe shape so that jenny could not see
much of the prince but once or twice he
leaned forward to catch her eye and to toast
her with the smile that had stolen her heart
away
  she found him more irresistible than ever
it was perfectly obvious that he still had
no suspicions it was marvelous to her
almost incredible she could hardly see at
that time so confused and distressed was
she that the mere possibility of there being
two girls so much alike had not presented
itself to him and still less would he or
any other young man in his place have
credited the empress with the bold simplici-
ty of such a deception the very success
of the undertaking lay in its impossibility
  but for jenny devon these thoughts were
too subtle she only knew that she felt
like a criminal
  the archduke was a very silent person
he only addressed her twice throughout the
elaborate and seemingly endless meal both
times it was to ask her opinion of a dish
he was very fond of jenny did not know
what his vacant air meant but she had an
idea that he was not exactly  all there
she believed for instance that after she
had been explained to him his mind slipped
back and he really took her to be his niece
he only seemed to live in his mimic battles
on the great maps with the toy soldiers and
the little flags
  all through the subdued but lively con-
versation of prince nicholass young
equerry captain florimar one thought em-
bedded itself in jennys brain
  the prince was too dear to her though
she was not close to him his spell was
stronger than ever she couldnt resist it
unless she used all her self-control she
must play a part-for her own sake if
he still wooed her she must keep him at
arms length it was her only salvation
if she allowed her heart to sway her she
would lose herself forever it was an in-
stinctive resolve he meant too much to
her he could mean nothing in the end
she could not bear it
  there was some wonderful orchestral
music after dinner the empress withdrew
very early the music went on after she
left prince nicholas bent over jenny
   come to the china room-i want to
talk to you he whispered
  she had to go with him it was clear
from the empresss manner that they were
to be allowed all the amenities of engaged
couples the girl thrilled all over as her
hand touched his coat sleeve but she was
stern with herself on with the mask
another womans life

  in the little cedar paneled room were
masses of forced white and purple lilac
the subtle rapturous scent met them like
a southern night breeze
   now youre going to make friends with
me stephanie nicholas said
   arent we friends jenny asked rather
awkwardly
   we werent when i left little girl why
did you hide yourself and write me that
freezing little note to make me come
back i suppose well youve done it
he bent to take her in his arms
  she drew back
  his eyes darkened
   so its like that you think you can
make a fool of me by putting out your
prickles i ought to have known from the
first that you were nothing but a flirt
thats what ones heard about you
  in her devastating nervousness jenny
used exactly the same words as the real
stephanie had spoken
   we-we shall get along all right
you said that before he retorted
 but why in heavens name were you
so different at first why did you let me
kiss you why did you cry why did you
lie in my arms as if you liked to be there
why did you look at me with those wonder-
ful eyes of love
  on with the mask
  jenny braced herself she made her voice
gay it sounded awful in her own ears
   i-i thought id try to fall in love with
you
   and you didnt succeed he laughed
angrily  many thanks its a pity it
was a pretty mood of yours you must be
a wonderful actress i quite thought we
might-have been happy together
   i did too she laughed-on the verge
of hysteria
   its just as well to know where we
are he said savagely and looked like a
beautiful young thunderstorm  you
neednt think that i shall worry you in any
way i was an idiot to come back
   why did you she asked the farce
had to be kept up
   because you were so nasty to me he
answered bluntly  the dear little girl of
the first days i should have thought of and
dreamed about and gone on with my life as
usual but after the days hunting and
your horrid ways at the ball- he broke
off furiously  why you kissed me will-
ingly enough before but i might have
been poison that night and not a sight of
you afterward except in chapel looking like
a wooden image thats why i came back
and im sorry i ever did
   so am i echoed jenny from her heart
indeed although her voice made the state-
ment sound unkind and shrill
   well it doesnt matter nicholas said
 i suppose we can at least be friends its
about the utmost we could expect anyway-
people like us its a darned shame were
positive slaves well i wont keep you
here any longer stephanie ive made an
idiotic mistake shake hands we may
as well be friends as weve got to marry
   yes said jenny with feverish light-
ness in her voice  we may as well be
friends as weve got to marry
  they shook hands and jenny fled to her
rooms while from below the maddening
stupefying strains of the  love death of
 tristan and isolde followed her

 tv it me lacour writes that she is
i y i held up the baroness said to
jenny with anxiously knitted
brows  she has the material for the wed-
ding gown she has more than a dozen
dresses ready she urges an immediate
visit
   how can i go there the girl asked
 they all know me so well they would
be sure to recognize me
   it is most risky i admit the place
is comparatively small
   cant you put madame off asked
jenny  the archduchess must be back
one day this week you said they had
traced her to naples
  i know but what excuse can we
make the clothes are so important

court gowns not yet fitted

argosy-allstory weekly
  in the end the baroness found a solution
mme lacour was commanded to argar
castle with her young ladies one of the
big paneled rooms was rigged up with a
stage at one end
  jenny and the baroness sat in the dark-
ened room while the manikins paraded on
the brilliantly lit platform showing off the
exquisite creations madame who curt-
sied to the ground before her ex-manikin
explained the gowns and begged for a fit-
ting for some of them she had previously
explained to the baroness that the manikin
of whom the archduchess had generously
approved had left her establishment in the
most sudden manner and with shameful in-
gratitude she had met her in the street
not many days ago and actually offered to
take her back but she had only received
a telegram from her saying that she had
accepted another post
  jenny saw little linette gurney with her
hunched shoulders and her plain pathetic
little face she badly wanted to talk to
her it was hard work not to when after-
ward she stood up and the gorgeous silver
cloth of the manteau de cour was draped
on her and the shoulder knots of real pearls
were brought from the jewel case and fas-
tened in their places and madame stood
back in delight pointing out the del bleu
velvet roses nestling in the glittering em-
broidery that lined the side of the train
   your imperial highness it is ravishing 
she cried  its a dream-a poem
  and little linette her mouth full of pins
looked up with adoration at the slender
girlish figure with the radiant hair the
perfect princess of her dreams standing
there proud and unsmiling as if the sight
of all these beautiful clothes could arouse
no emotion in her royal breast that was
how a princess should be in the little cock-
neys eyes unmoved completely wrapped
up in her own greatness and her own
beauty
  jenny gave her a quick smile before she
left the room and linette gurney walked
on air for a week
  it was a very severe test a triumphant
one nobody recognized her but then
of course they never dreamed of such a
thing
   there is a deputation for you to receive
this morning the baroness informed jenny
two days later when she came into her
room to announce and discuss the plans for
the day
   some gentlemen who are the trustees
of the hospital and convalescent home for
children of the east end of london that
you laid the foundation stone of the other
day are bringing the plans and an illumi-
nated address and a wedding present
   what do i do asked jenny in
alarm
   you look at the plans and accept the
address and the present and say a few words
of thanks it wont take long you will
receive them in the blue drawing room
prince nicholas will be with you you
neednt be in the least nervous they are
city men and not one of them has ever seen
you before
   is there no news asked jenny anx-
iously
   not yet nothing definite unfortu-
nately they had left naples but they are
positively located it can only be a mat-
ter of days the empress has sent tele-
grams to the king of italy and to the pope
the utmost pressure is being brought to
bear
   i dont think i can keep it up much
longer said jenny half crying with the
strain  its having to play a part-all the
time
   you are doing wonderfully well my
dear comforted the baroness  its amaz-
ing youre much more like the arch-
duchess now so gay and a little more
careless than you were
   more desperate you mean put in the
girl with a touch of passion
   and the prince is it going all right
are you remembering
   i am remembering jenny answered
 that as far as i can make out the arch-
duchess will treat him like dirt oh yes it
is quite all right we have agreed to be
friends
  she had learned her lesson she was be-
having to the prince as she imagined the
archduchess had done she was apparent-
ly doing it very well he was jolly and in
the highest spirits on the surface but she
another womans life

believed he was profoundly disappointed in
her
  what could that matter she had taken
this game on her feelings didnt count
if she broke her heart that was nothing as
long as the match between nicholas of gal-
matia and stephanie of rosemark became
an accomplished fact royalties didnt ex-
pect domestic happiness nicholas con-
stantly said so he said things in a care-
less way that cut her to the very quick
he assumed that she was just a girl who
would bury her feelings deep out of sight
for the sake of those horrid  reasons of
state who was quite willing to make a po-
litical marriage and eventually become a
queen and so heartless was she that she
had even pretended to fall in love with him
until his too ready response offended her
  he despised her jenny felt that and
she was more desperately and hopelessly in
love with him than ever
  the hour came to receive the deputation
  they assembled in the blue drawing-
room a vast chamber with the usual fur-
nishings of state apartments in royal pal-
aces much gilding enormous glittering
crystal chandeliers chairs and couches up-
holstered in sky blue velvet curtains em-
broidered in gold a hideous carpet like a
pale blue sea with the imperial coat of
arms in the center and a border of golden
eagles
  prince nicholas was attended by three
gentlemen the archduchess by the baron-
ess another lady and general mortis
they stood by a huge marble-topped table
with gilded feet
  the deputation came in and was pre-
sented by one of the household
  jenny had learned to look at people with-
out seeing them particularly a group of
people she smiled and held out her hand
and each gentleman in turn bent low over
it
  then suddenly her heart seemed to stand
still
   mr marcus phare announced the
resonant voice  mr phare is one of the
two trustees your imperial highness and
has most generously increased the endow-
ment of the hospital by fifty thousand
pounds
  jenny stood like a statue she could not
bring herself to look at the man but she
knew from something magnetic in the at-
mosphere that it was he
  the little ceremony went on she ex-
amined the plans praised them she re-
ceived the address and a beautiful golden
casket she thanked the deputation in the
few words she had learned by heart in a
very low voice shaking with nervousness
  then prince nicholas moved about
among the gentlemen and she supposed she
ought to do the same
  she nerved herself looked up and im-
mediately met the concentrated gaze of
marcus phares steely blue eyes they
flashed an unmistakable message to her in
that moment she knew that he knew who
she was
  she did not know what to do she felt
like a rat in a trap she knew that he
would not speak to her unless she spoke to
him first she longed frantically to test
her fears yet she was trembling so that
she could hardly move
  she caught the baronesss eyes with fear
in them the lady in waiting thought she
was going to break down she mustnt do
that she forced herself to move she
spoke to one member of the deputation
then to another she came up to marcus
phare it seemed as if it took her a year
her head was swimming
   its-a lovely day she managed to
say
  he bowed with the easy grace of a man
accustomed to mix with all classes of peo-
ple in all countries
   as your imperial highness says he
replied  it is a lovely day
  she heard the subtle accent on the title
and she knew as well as possible that he was
giving it to her knowing it to be a lie
  the moment had come the game had
failed she was found out
  the deputation withdrew the last thing
jenny was aware of was the uncompromis-
ing gaze of those blue eyes that revealed
nothing that promised nothing that
threatened everything
  she did not dare tell the baroness the
rest of the day passed like a dream she
tried to persuade herself that she was

argosy-allstory weekly
wrong she would wait for a sign from
him
several days passed and none came
chapter xiv
the end of the game
it came to the day on which prince nich-
olas was leaving england again not to
return before the wedding
  to jenny this whole period had been a
whirl so confusing that she could hardly
tell one day from the other deputations
bringing presents addresses of congratula-
tion court ceremonies three nights in
london a glittering pageant of public
gatherings balls banquets a gala night
at the opera drives through thronged
streets a sea of faces around her that she
had never seen before and would never see
again
  people raved about the bride and said
that she looked very tired but more lovely
than words could describe her behavior
was perfect she seemed to touch every-
bodys heart the gay mouth and the sad
questioning eyes and the weariness from
the incessant strain made a combination
that seemed to lift her into another sphere
  every day she asked the baroness for
news each day there was none the run-
away pair had escaped to greece the
pursuers were hot on their trail it could
only be a matter of days perhaps hours
   but said jenny again and again in
despair  it cant go on
  the baroness admitted that it couldnt
go on but there was no doubt the
archduchess must be brought back within
a day or two after the princes departure
ennv must hold out she had done so
much never never could they repay her
  they were back at argar castle there
was a lull there had been a walk in the
park in the morning to inspect the deer
prince nicholas was making his prepara-
tions for departure he was to leave about
six
  at five oclock a message from him was
brought to jenny in her rooms-would she
honor his royal highness by meeting him in
the library
  she could think of no excuse her heart
failed her as she slipped into a gown of
white cashmere with dull silver embroid-
eries and a hem of white fur
  she went downstairs alone and found
nicholas standing by the great open fire-
place looking rather awkward and self-
conscious as she came in he took a large
flat case from a table beside him
   these have just come stephanie i
wanted to give them to you they are my
presents a messenger brought them to-
day
  he opened the case she fell back daz-
zled by the splendor of the jewels more
rubies-a long chain a large square pen-
dant big earrings bangles and a gorgeous
stomacher
  oh she said below her breath
 they are much too grand for me
  she spoke out of her heart laying the
case on a large table on which were silver
baskets full of red roses and she looked
at him speechless with sorrow and fear
  stephanie his voice was low and
hoarse and thrilling  why you speak
like the little girl of the china room and
you look- oh stephanie
  before she could move she was in his
arms and he was raining kisses on her face
and hair and she was sobbing as if her
heart would break
   stephanie stephanie you do care
my little love my little love you were
playing and pretending all the time-trying
to pretend but you do care i can see
it in your lovely eyes i can feel your lit-
tle heart beating against mine
  she went on crying she could not help
herself she did not give back the kisses
but she lay passive in his strong young
arms in a hazy dream of bliss lulled by
the beloved voice showering on her its pas-
sionate words of love
   stephanie you have given yourself
away you little witch oh my sweet-
heart how i love you how i love you
and i know you love me i shall be away
such a short time and then ill come back
and well never be parted again
  the magic moments passed she hardly
knew what she said-just broken sentences
things that a lover knows but always wants
another womans life

to hear all her defences were broken
down
 they stood there lost to everything but
 themselves not heeding the rubies and the
 roses but only their love
 then nicholas had to tear himself away
 and his last words were a gay command
  think of me every second sweetheart
 until i come back
 a week to the wedding five days to
 the wedding three days to the wedding
 jenny asked the baroness her daily ques-
 tion
  where is the archduchess
 and the answer was one of despair
  i dont know they have escapea
 they have disappeared
 there seemed nothing to say the sit-
 uation was monstrous a royal wedding-
 and no royal bride
 the day came on which the prince was
 returning he was to arrive in the eve-
 ning it was against imperial usage for
 him to stay at the castle so the house of
 a neighboring landowner had been placed
 at his disposal and that of his suite
 but he was coming to dine en famille at
 the castle
  the empress had been laid up with in-
fluenza the baroness was terrified of the
effect on her frail health
  jenny and the baroness were summoned
to her majestys sitting room about a quar-
ter of an hour before the prince was due
  the little old lady was more richly
dressed than ever and her jewels were more
splendid
  she smiled at jenny
   there is no news of stephanie she
said  she has entirely disappeared you
have done all you can the prince will be
here directly i will tell him the truth
there is nothing else to be done as soon
as he comes i will tell him
  some one came to say that his royal
highnesss motor car had entered the castle
gates
  the empress smiled at jenny again
   go to your rooms my child it is not
fair for you to be here it has been my
doing the prince shall know that you are
perfectly blameless luini you can stay
until the prince comes then you can
withdraw too i would rather speak to
his royal highness alone
  jenny trembling in every limb made
her deep curtsy and left the room
  to be continued next week
   the out trail
a little moons the new moon low in green skies
    yet who can see the new moon but something in him sighs
to start for secret places beyond the edge of things
a new hope in his bosom and a heart that sings
wondrously the rounded moon wheels overhead
and floods the world with loveliness till desire is dead
and beauty drowns the breathless world but better had desire
not perished in this loveliness of still white fire
a wistful moons the old moon fading with day
and weary the returning feet of one long astray
who sought the secret places-but something in his eyes
reveals the strange happiness of a heart that sighs

by jim tully
they called him the gatlin gun he
could hit from any angle with the
speed of machine gun fire
  he continually wore the expression of a
lost sheep in the ring and always when
hit hard he would look at his antagonist
as if to say  now that wasnt fair in
the flash of an eye he would then turn tiger
and send terrific five-ounce mallets of pain
in all directions some were jabs of six
inches in length and some were swings that
swished swiftly through the air humming
like bullets and some were straight arm
jabs that carried a long sleep in their wake
  indeed a mighty man was the gatlin
gun and mighty men he had whipped
and to the credit of the ring there was
always a new man to trade blows with him
for fear is a plant of weak growth in the
prize ring the gatlin guns rivals asked
no odds they gave none and when whipped
they tried to rise with oblivion creeping
over their brains
  the gatlin gun feinted with his black
eyes so great a master was he that he
could look at one point in his antagonists
defense and aim his blows there then sud-
denly shift his aim to the unprotected por-
tion of the other fighters body they
would land with the impact of iron weights
hitting a wall
  the gatlin gun was a handsome fellow
his brown hair waved back from a high
white forehead his features were strong
well proportioned and well chiseled he
weighed one hundred and seventy pounds
  he seldom talked long at a time
  neither had he ever been known to have
a sense of fear or pity he was as merci-
less as a gatling gun prepared for action
  he leaned his elbows on the table in the
dining car and looked out of the window
with a bored expression while his manager
chatted  were guaranteed ten thousand
gatlin and even if we do say well give
two thousand to iron jaw bolan for lasting

the glass jaw

ten rounds-well he just wont last them
this guys got a glass jaw an youll stick
your mitt through it before the fight goes
very long
   yes ill crack him early said the
gatlin gun  i want to get the ten thirty
train back to cleveland
   thats the ticket was teddys com-
ment  i hate to lay over all night in
these tank towns
  the gatlin gun rubbed his knuckles
and said  all right but im tired of fight-
ing boobs first thing you know well do
a jolt for murder this guys been in the
war and had a bullet rip through his jaw
this is the first time out since then and
before that every fighter he met used to
pull the curtain down over the glass win-
dow in his jaw
    yep said the manager a swarthy lit-
tle fellow with a black needle-pointed mus-
tache  they call him iron jaw bolan now
an he thinks hes good they were kiddin
him when i was down there gettin the
match an he says  well you kin tell the
gatlin gun for me hell have to shoot em
hardern a gatlin cause im goin to lick
im
  the gatlin gun smiled and rubbed his
well chiseled jaw with his left hand he
then put his silk cuff in place and still
smiling said  i hear iron jaw can hit
teddy is that so
   yep answered teddy  they tell me
he throws a mean mitt but he cant hit
a clever man he goes to pieces when they
crack im on the jaw and he has to get a
new pane o glass in it hes been battered
on the head so much hes goofy poor
fish
   yep poor fish repeated the gatlin
gun  ill drain the water out of the pond
to-night
  the train swerved the engine whistle
shrieked and soon the long limited slowed
up and stopped at findlay
  a committee wearing badges met the
gatlin gun and his manager teddy ray
at the station  great night said the
chairman to teddy  the crowds crazy to
see the gatlin gun wte got your guar-
antee in advance already and still theyre
cornin teddy ray was loquacious while
the gatlin gun smoothed the well tailored
lapel of his coat and upstaged the crowd
leaders of uneventful lives counters of
money employers of labor lawyers and
doctors who were they anyhow they
didnt even know how to block a left jab
  a taxi drew up and manager and fighter
were whisked away to the leading hotel the
lobby of which was crowded to obtain a
view of the famous gatlin gun but he
like a bored preacher at a bartenders pic-
nic ignored them all
   i wish iron jawd knock his block off
exclaimed a man in the crowd
  if wishes were horses wed ah have
fords was the comeback of another
 iron jaw cant hit that bird with a load
of buckshot
  iron jaw bolan was one of those men
who would have been a great fighter but-
he had a glass jaw a knockout on the
jaw is the most painless of all knockouts
a quick curtain drops on the brain and the
pugilist sinks forgetful of battles and
blows and sleeps for a short while the
next day or week the jaw might ache and
sometimes nothing but soft nourishment
can be taken but that is all
  a glass jaw is one in which the nerves
leading up to the brain are more easily con-
nected with in all other ways it may be
even an iron muscled jaw but this weak-
ness has kept more pugilists from reaping
the great reward than all others combined
at least seventy-five out of every hundred
knockouts are bludgeoned on the jaw
iron jaw bolan had been given his name
ironically on account of the dreaded glass
jaw
  he was silent and stolid life to him
was a drab meadow and he was an ox that
roamed within he had always been a
drawing card in findlay in spite of the
weak jaw for he battled like a fiend
and not all hitters even the heaviest of
them connected with the jaw when they
connected squarely the fight was generally
over he would not have a manager he
trained always with a larger and even more
stolid brother
  his legs were of iron and he could run
ten miles over the pretty roads that
stretched through the countryside

a rgosy-allstory weekly
  then the war came and he went away
with his brother he was going over the
top one morning when a bullet popped into
his mouth it carried away part of his
lower jawbone
  he was taken to a base hospital and
later removed to paris the surgeons there
took one of his ribs and fashioned a new
jawbone for him
  when the war ended it found iron jaw
bolan full of dumb agony over his blasted
future
  knowing the weak nature of his jaw he
had given up the ring completely to-
gether the two brothers tilled their farm
and put stolid dreams of ring careers be-
hind them seemingly forever
  always a diligent reader of boxing news
iron jaw bolan allowed nothing to escape
him by a peculiar twist of the mind he
had learned the leading events in ring his-
tory from the very beginning of it tom
figg jem mace heenan and sayers cor-
bett jeffries and fitzsimmons were all fa-
miliar to him he knew their famous blows
and all their fighting eccentricities
  after reading the offer of two thousand
made by the gatlin guns manager to any
man who would stay ten rounds with him
iron jaw turned to his brother jack and
said  i wonder if i kin keep my jaw outa
the gatlins way for ten rounds it ud
mean a lot to me an you both well never
git on our feet this way janes been wait-
ing a long time now an we owe everybody
an his brother i jist gotta take a chance
on gittin my jaw cracked or somethin
  jack rubbed a stubby chin and looked
across at his brother
  iron jaws parents had named him pearl
but no one but jack and jane ever called
him that it was too much like saying
 kitty  to a lion  well pearl you
know till they started crackin your jaw
they werent no better man in the world
i	never see no one could fight like you
then course they all played for your jaw
an you was so busy blockin it you couldnt
give your tention to the fight then when
you did zowie theyd gloom you
  the conversation always ended the same
when the days work was over stolid men
the bolans were but they had one thing in
keeping with the men who eventually win
they had the tenacity of bulldogs fighting
to the death over the bone that was their
ambition
   ill tell you pearl ill git john ames
to match you with the gatlin gun you
kin draw a crowd here if youll fight again
are you willin
   yes answered iron jaw slowly  ill
fight him
   thats good as slowly answered jack
 you kin keep your jaw down an ill prac-
tice hittin it a little harder each day while
youre trainin
  in a few days the gatlin guns manager
appeared and the match was made
  the brothers trained alone and faith-
fully
  many a night in a large attic room by
the feeble glare of two kerosene lamps they
boxed and wrestled about always did
jack play carefully for the jaw of his
brother and always would he lurch for-
ward to hold him when he was apparently
beaten after a furious exchange between
the two iron jaw once said  now listen
jack talk to the referee good tell him
not to stop the fight till he counts ten may-
be ill jist stagger an look bad an not be
out maybe that little somethin jerks over
my brain an goes right away again
   ill member that replied jack  the
referees a good guy you know that
   yeah i know but watch he dont for-
get
  as the hour of the fight drew near the
two brothers walked slowly in the direc-
tion of the place in which it was to be
held
  breasts pounding with drama they still
remained as quiet as one of their own mules
at midnight not able to give utterance to
their feelings they looked at the indistinct
shadows along the road but said no word
   wonder what jane  think of the
fight remarked iron jaw presently
   she told me she might come jack
replied and then as if in an afterthought
 i wish it was over
   it wont be long now said iron jaw
 it  be over soon
  they hurried past the crowd in front of
the building and entered the rear door all
the glass jaw

was excitement within the elite of the
findlay sporting world had gathered there
jack called the referee aside and said so
all could hear  we dont ask for nothin
only dont rule pearl out before you count
ten we got a hunch he might stagger an
act goofy but if hes on is feet let im stay
will yer
  the referee and promoter a smare bil-
liard room owner looked at the intense
face of jack and then at iron jaw  ill
do that for its cornin to you both he
answered
  iron jaw stepped up and said  thanks
john and stood back silent
   think youll win iron asked the
referee
   i know it replied iron jaw as he
walked toward the dressing room with jack
   lordy said an overhearer as the
brothers walked away  if nerve was money
them guys would be peerpoint morgan
   well you gotta admire them for that
rejoined another  and besides we all know
iron jaw can fight
  in a short time gatlin gun appeared on
the scene the place became a-whirr with
the murmur of voices but the napoleon
of the ring looked neither to the right or
to the left his manager walked ahead
as much as to say  make way for the
king and men fell back a bell boy fol-
lowed carrying the gatlin guns fighting
paraphernalia
  the gatlin gun was soon alone in the
dressing room save for the boy who re-
mained near him like a trained monkey
the boy would jump at the slightest nod of
the gatlin gun
  teddy ray left and soon returned to the
gatlin guns dressing room  the first
prelims over he said an theres a six
round semi between two hams they cant
stand up six rounds so well sure make
that train i got all our dough but the two
thousand we got to give up if iron jaw
stays the limit ill grab that right away
an well beat it for the depot in a taxi
  that suits me fine these hick towns
give me the shivers answered the gatlin
gun
  the semiwind-up ended in the third
round the crowd yelled for the main event
  the gatlin gun was the first to climb
through the ropes proud was his bearing
as became a man who in a hundred battles
had never been knocked down by a blow
from a glove immediately his face took
on the lamblike expression it was part of
his repertoire he tested the ropes and
then walked casually about the ring the
crowd cheered lustily but he paid no atten-
tion his body was as well formed and
powerful as the granite dream of a sculptor
his feet no sooner touched the canvas than
they seemed to spring his form forward as
though on new rubber narrow in the hips
his body widened until it was immense at
the shoulders a mountain of graceful mus-
cle he was whom the leather rage of battle
had never dented his eyes darted quickly
hither and thither not the slightest move-
ment escaping him they were eyes that
could see more than those of many people
  when he returned to his corner he spoke
tersely to his manager and as he did so his
thin lips curled into a half sneer then
the tiger crept into his eyes and puckered
lines of cruelty formed around them
  he seated himself and looked up in an
unconcerned manner while loud cheering
shook the building
  iron jaw bolan was climbing through the
ropes his brother followed him he had
no other seconds or trainers
  he contrasted greatly with the gatlin
gun the scar on his jaw could be distinct-
ly seen under the strong lights of the ring
while the crowd still cheered he threw his
bathrobe over the chair in his corner and
stood with his left hand leaning on the top
rope of the ring
  the crowd gasped at the muscular build
of the man  lord if he didnt have a
glass jaw commented one man
   cant tell maybe some doctor in france
lined it with iron laughed another  hes
game though you gotta say that for him
added a third the gloves were adjusted
and the men were called quickly to the
center of the ring
  around them grouped several men jack
bolan stood back of iron jaw a heavy
towel thrown over his arm the customary
instructions were given and the fighters
nodded their heads with half bored looks

argosy-allstory weekly
as men will who have heard the same words
many times in another minute they
touched gloved hands in what was meant as
a quick handshake
  they returned to their corners and pres-
ently the announcer shouted pointing to the
gatlin guns corner  la-dies a-n-d gen-
tle-men jack carrol in this corner cham-
peen of the wo-r-ld then he snapped like
the crack of a whip  the gatlin gun
the crowd cheered and the great bruiser
condescended to nod at them with a bored
expression
  and then-in the same singsong voice
 la-dies a-n-d gen-tle-men - iron jaw
bolan-the pride of findlay more cheer-
ing  the men will fight ten rounds to a
decision the champeen forfeits two thou-
sand dollars if he fails to knock out iron
jaw bolan he clapped kis hands to-
gether
  a tense quiet spread over the crowd
the gong rang the gatlin gun and iron
jaw went forth to battle
  they made a picture of animal motion
that thrilled the crowd iron jaws right
arm was bent and the glove formed a bul-
wark of protection against his left jaw
through which the bullet had gone the
gatlin gun his hands moving gracefully
his face mild was feinting with his eyes
iron jaw fell into the trap for a second and
his right glove dropped from his left jaw
the gatlin guns great shoulders moved
quicker than a flash and his right glove
zipped through the air and caught poor
iron jaw in the very place the bullet had
he staggered backward his eyes popping
his gloves sinking to his sides his body
falling to the floor the gatlin gun
stepped back the gleam of execution in his
eyes jack bolan yelled  come on
pearl you aint licked yet he wasnt
he was up at the count of three and rush-
ing like a madman the expression of a
lamb left the gatlin guns face he was
a tiger driven into a comer
  one body swayed against the ropes then
another they fought to the center of the
ring amid a thudding clatter of gloves the
gatlin gun had no time to measure his
man though he did throw sledgelike leather
blows at the glass jaw of his antagonist
they worked in close and the great science
of the gatlin gun came into play blows
rained from every angle on iron jaw he
lifted one foot at a time and stamped it
on the canvas floor to relieve the pain he
then stood rigid the muscles in his legs as
taut as the strings of a violin
   ill break your jaw damn you hissed
the gatlin gun in a clinch iron jaw kept
on fighting and grunted  huh  then the
gong rang
  jack bolan gave iron jaw a piece of
lemon to suck he poured cold water down
his back and said slowly  watch his right
its the one to zip you
  no word was ever said to the gatlin
gun in his corner during a fight he would
not allow it as well interrupt a napoleon
poring over the plan of a battle the gong
rang for the second round
  iron jaw rushed from his corner swinging
a wild haymaker that missed the gatlin
guns gloves played a rat-a-tat-tat on his
face before he gained his balance he tied
iron jaw into knots with his marvelous
feinting he then rattled blows in rapid
succession against his opponent
  iron jaw bent his head low like a man
caught in a hailstorm who does not wish his
face cut to pieces he wisely decided not
to look at the gatlin guns eyes danger
lay there curled like a rattler iron jaw
suddenly worked in close and ripped his
right hand downward on the muscle cov-
ered kidneys of the gatlin gun the
round had been a fierce encounter from the
start with always iron jaw keeping his head
down when the gong rang the fighters
dropped soggy gloves to their sides and
went to their corners
  a stamping and cheering started it did
not completely die down until die gong
sounded for the third round
  with the suddenness of a bullet shot out
of a gun iron jaws antagonist rushed from
his comer the crowd stood up as he
planted six vicious triphammer blows on
iron jaws scar he went down like an ox
felled with an ax terrific screaming fol-
lowed and a hush followed as quickly after
iron jaw was on his feet without taking a
count the astonished gatlin gun stared
at him as he rushed forward
                         	a
the glass jaw

  as iron jaw whipped four blows to the
gatlin guns face teddy ray looked seri-
ous his face relaxed as his man drove
iron jaw halfway across the ring with a
left to the heart he was after him like a
flash iron jaw bolan stood instinctively
knowing that a storm was headed his way
it came in gales of whirling blows he
pinned his left jaw to his breast and fought
back on even terms until he stepped into a
short left jolt to the chin and he folded
over toward the gatlin gun with his head
down the back of his neck exposed the
gatlin gun whipped a murderous right
downward and it crashed solidly on iron
jaws neck the latters face went livid
with rage the crowd hooted iron jaw
became a madman while pain jabbed
needles in his brain
   ouh he screamed his brother held
the rope as though he would squeeze it in
two iron jaw bellowed again as another
blow followed the first then he wrenched
his body away and balanced himself for
the briefest of seconds and rushed at the
gatlin gun no living man could have
stopped him few could have stood before
him one hundred and seventy pounds of
hurtling bone and muscle he was driven
with the fury and pain of a titanic passion
  he rushed against the ropes as the gatlin
gun sidestepped with bleeding face he
turned quickly and rushed again at the
gatlin gun relentless he tore after him
now crouching now with a terrible swaying
motion of his body his arms throwing so
many blows that the gatlin gui was
forced to block and quit fighting for a mo-
ment
  the gatlin gun measured him after a
lime and stepped in close he ripped a
catapault left to iron jaws chin his head
went backward in time to expose his left
jaw completely to a horrible right that
followed his knees shook like posts struck
by lightning then he crashed to the floor
and rolled over and over the referee
followed counting the while
  blood dripping from his macerated lips
the back of his neck raw his sides oozing
red fluid-the undaunted owner of the glass
jaw rose at the count of seven  ill kill
you damn you he groaned
   	a
  the good looking master of boxing and
brawn said tersely  shut up and fight
   i am-damn you screamed iron jaw
bolan just then the gatlin gun stepped
in and delivered blows with masterful pre-
cision the fourth round ended
  when the gatlin gun went to his cor-
ner teddy ray said  finish him quick
the train leaves in a little while
   ill sure get him this round was the
retort
  jack bolan mumbled into the ears of his
younger brother  he caint lick you
pearl he aint man enough he flops
you down but you bounce up like rubber
  the noise lulled into silence when the
fifth round started quickly the men toed
the scratch arms flying like iron weights
fastened to a revolving wheel iron jaw
stepped in and looked up
   dont look at im shouted jack and
his head dropped in time to get away from
an uppercut aimed at his chin the gat-
lin guns jaw was set his lamblike ex-
pression gone his teeth grated he boxed
with the art and speed of the master that
he was with the accuracy of perfectly
aimed gunfire he shot lefts and rights to all
points of iron jaws face and body as
the latter went to his knees the fur of the
gatlin guns rush made him hurtle over
him
  iron jaw rose and whirled into the storm
of battle the pace of which was set by a
worlds champion he went down and rose
he went down again
   hes done murmured a man in the
first row  the gatlin gun wins
  but the gatlin gun was not the winner
not yet iron jaw rose and steadied him-
self
   make him rush pearl shouted jack
bolan
  the gatlin gun sneered-and rushed
suddenly iron jaw shot a left that trav-
eled with lightning speed the distance of
six inches the power of a mules kick
was behind it the gatlin gun staggered
backward the fierce iron jaw after him
a swishing right and left sizzled over the
masters guard and he sank in a corner
there was never such a screaming before
the gatlin gun had been knocked down

argosy-allstory weekly
the referee counted  one-two-three-
four -silence sank like lead in water-
 five-six -the champion rolled over a
tired tiger- seven-eight -he rose to
his elbow- nine -he stood erect the
gong ended the round
  an engine whistle shrieked neither
manager nor gatlin gun heard it their
minds were on other and more important
things
  jack bolan hugged his glass jawed
brother cheers rolled over the audience
interspersed with handclapping
  a voice in a tone of admirable derision
yelled  pearl-pearl-little pearl iron
jaw did not hear he stretched back on his
chair his big breast heaving mightily while
jack rubbed caustic over his bleeding
wounds the last round had thrilled the
stolid brothers
   i wish ma and pa could see you now
pearl said jack choking back the nearest
he had ever come to a sob in his life
  the gatlin gun leaned back in his chair
an egglike lump on his handsome jaw two
towels were swung in front of him in zigzag
fashion while teddy ray rubbed his hand-
some body no word was said teddy
ray like a man who had witnessed an exe-
cution was nervous the gatlin guns
face was set and the lines ran from the
corners of his eyes like little skin ditches
dug with a razor blade
   youll cop him this round gatlin
an well breeze outta here on that train
like the wind just then a whistle shrieked
 we got twenty minutes yet resumed
teddy
  all noise had subsided the gong boomed
like the echo of a bell in a tomb the
lighters rose with muscles taut for a sec-
ond each man surveyed the other they
then walked slowly forward in the manner
of men who carry bombs in each hand
every fighting cell in their brains was alert
the gatlin gun walked close and feinted
with his eyes manipulating his gloves with
dazzling speed the while iron jaw was
confused and jerked his head upward
the gatlin guns left crashed through but
iron jaws chin was down before it landed
it caught him on the bleeding forehead
the right followed after and whizzed across
the top of his left ear it stung like electric
needles
  maddened to desperation iron jaw
whaled in close and kept his glove pounding
furiously but he was not alone at the
pounding flashing blow after flashing
blow followed and then the gatlin gun
fell into a clinch falling out of it he
rammed a right and left to iron jews
face the latter worked in and clinched
his huge bearlike arm worked around and
pounded the gatlin guns back as with
a heavy bludgeon in fierce retaliation the
gatlin gun sledged the top of iron jaws
neck with rabbit blows called thus for the
reason that it is the way rabbits are killed
  through battered lips iron jaw hissed
 i aint a rabbit the words were no
sooner spoken than a look of madness came
over the gatlin gun the rough unshaven
face of iron jaw leered at him he forgot
that he was the mental master of the man
who held him as a bear does a victim
he tore himself loose with magnificent fury
his arms began to work like tremendous
white and red flails under control of the
lightning his gloves were heavy with
blood and water the squishy impact of
them could be heard a dozen rows from the
ringside
  iron jaw bolan stood up under the with-
ering attack and leered his brother jack
yelled  he caint lick you pearl the
words taunted the gatlin gun he rushed
madly at iron jaw who fell backward
against the ropes
  they struggled fiercely and it was now
the gatlin gun who leaned against the
ropes fighting madly the long whistle of
an engine could be heard above the whir of
battle
  the men worked out of one clinch and
rushed madly into another four rights
followed in thudding impact on iron jaws
scar science and ringcraft were blotted
out
   come on an fight snapped the gat-
lin gun
   come on yourself was the rejoinder
  hands low heads together they slugged
their knees sagged and became stiff again
they backed away and iron jaw missed
two smashes that unbalanced him the
the glass jaw

gatlin gun stepped in iron jaw slugged
him away the gatlin gun shot a left
that knocked iron jaw reeling against the
back curtain he sank quickly to the floor
iron jaw rose swinging his arms wildly
 he wants to watch now said a man
near the ring  or the gatlin  knock him
coldern a snowball
  a wild right swing-a miss-a counter
by the gatlin gun-and iron jaws head
hit the floor with a thud he rose again
suddenly they fought to the center of the
ring the gatlin gun shifted to long range
boxing once more and iron jaw danced
about him as if anxious for an opening at
infighting
   i wish it was over well miss the darn
train sure thought teddy ray then as
a terrific blow landed  hes got him
but not yet iron jaw ripped both
gloves to the body they lifted his antago-
nist from the floor in a quick come-
back he was himself staggered by a jolt
to the scarred jaw four gloved hands
crossed each other in the fury of the fight-
ing that followed darkness came a dyna-
mo was changed at the electric plant and
the lights suddenly went out for a few sec-
onds they no sooner went on again than
the men were at each other with renewed
fury heads rocked with punches as one
after the other held the upper hand
  punch after punch was delivered amid
wild cheering then a silence fell next
a cheering iron jaw was down he rose
then gatlin gun was down he rose
shaking his head
  they clinched until their bodies seemed
chained together suddenly a right jolt
shot upward a body sagged downward
and fell face foremost on the floor and
rolled over three times the referee count-
ed the gatlin gun was out excitement
ruled
  jack bolan hugged his brother their
eyes glistened the ring was full of
people
  the gatlin gun sat in his corner for
many minutes a doctor was called
   you see said the man of medicine
 the german bullet must have torn away
the nerve in bolans jaw that connected
with the brain its not how hard you hit
a mans jaw you must hit it in a vital
spot that was a lucky bullet for him
   well said teddy ray as if anxious
to get the gatlin guns mind off serious
things  the trains gone
   sos the two thousand was the gatlin
guns rejoinder  and the championship
on the heights
 this is no day for tears
     the glorious mountains sane and high
 rest in unbroken calm upon the crest of earth
 impregnable serene
 the sun stoops down to kiss their fringe of pine trees
 green and sweet perfumed with gods own nectar
 unmoved by earthly cares and unperturbed by grief
 why then should we despair
 are we not worthy to be part
 of gods great scheme of beauty
 or must we grieving ever contemplate
 the everlasting failure to perfect
 the pattern given us to weave
 with threads all tangled by our ignorance

dered man is alfred hughes valet to henry orbit one of the wealthy residents of a block

hughes were enemies and also that there had been a slight fire in orbits bedroom it develops
that the valet was a bully drunkard and trifler with women and therefore had other enemies

denny while they are interviewing orbit to inquire whether horace has been seen later it
develops that horace has disappeared
chapter ix
in thin air
ylad you could come at once mc-
j carty eustace goddards round
ruddy face was sagging and pale
and the humorous quirk beneath the ends
of the small sandy mustache had given
place to a tremulous droop  your in-
spector thought i had some information
for you about that valets death when i
telephoned headquarters to ask for your
address and i didnt undeceive him dont
want any notoriety about this while a shad-
 story began in the argosy -
ow of doubt remains but god-i-im
afraid
     youll recall special deputy riordan
  from that first talk we had at orbits
  mccarty indicated his colleague who stood
  speechless with tense interest in the door-
  way  you told me over the phone that
  your boy had been kidnaped hes pretty
  big for that aint he-and in broad day
   what else can we think goddard
  threw out his short pudgy arms in a help-
  less gesture  horry vanished in thin air
  this afternoon he hadnt any idea of going
  out in fact he complained of a headache

annihilation

after iunch-he has never been very strong
-and his mother left him curled up on the
couch in the library here with his sketch
book when she went shopping she re-
turned late to dress for orbits musicale
and i didnt inquire for him supposing him
to be with trafford his tutor i reached
home from the club about half past five
and found trafford very much disturbed
but here he is hell tell you himself
mr trafford these are the men for whom
i sent will you tell them when you first
missed horry
  the thin anxious looking bespectacled
young man whom they had seen in conver-
sation with the watchman that afternoon
came slowly forward
   i went to the library at three to tell
him it was time for his latin lesson he
began his voice dazed and shaken  he
wasnt there and i searched the house for
him surprised that he should have gone out
without mentioning it then it occurred
to me that he might have slipped over to
mr orbits house next door where there is
an exceptionally fine collection of paintings
which fascinate him his ruling ambition
is to become an artist and mr orbit has
encouraged him but i digress i went
there to inquire for him but no one had
seen him and then really anxious i ques-
tioned the watchman who assured me that
he had not gone out either gate
   h-m remarked mccarty as dennis
shuffled his feet uneasily  and what did
you do after that mr trafford
   i concluded that horace had gone to
see the artist who has been instructing him
in drawing and of whom he is very fond
i could think of nothing else that would
account for his disappearance but it seemed
probable some neighbor with a key to the
mall had entered just as he left so that
the watchman need not have been called
upon to open the gate for him
  the young mans hands were clenching
and unclenching nervously and beads of
moisture stood out upon his forehead  i
therefore didnt mention it to mrs goddard
before she went to the musicale but waited
believing horace would return at any mo-
ment when the afternoon grew late i
searched the house again questioned the
servants even went across the street to
inquire at the sloane house for him young
mr sloane has taken an interest also in
his artistic efforts and it is the only other
house on the block he is privileged to visit
by himself since the burminsters are still
away i-i met with no success if i had
only given the alarm earlier
  he was turning away with a groan when
mccarty asked
   why didnt you think to phone blais-
dell and ask if the lad had been there traf-
ford
  the wretched tutor stared and goddard
who had been standing with his elbows on
the mantel and his head in his hands sud-
denly wheeled
   how did you know blaisdell is the art-
ist who has been giving him lessons he
demanded
  mccarty smiled
   i heard him say himself that blaisdell
was going on a sketching tour next month
and would take him only you wouldnt hear
of it he explained  the boy was wild to
go along-
   mr blaisdell started yesterday the
tutor interrupted  i learned this when i
telephoned to his studio this afternoon as
i did as soon as the idea occurred to me
that horace might have gone there i for-
got to mention it but my anxiety- i feel
criminally negligent in having taken the sit-
uation so easily
   dont the boy ever get a chance to play
with other lads dennis spoke for the first
time his tone filled with pitying contempt
 couldnt he have gone to the park and
then home to supper with one or another of
them
   my son does not play in the park
goddard responded with dignity  he
rides there with a select class from the
academy on two mornings of the week
but the season does not reopen until next
month horace is delicate as i told you
and has never cared for rough physical ex-
ercise although he is far from being a
mollycoddle he has a few friends of his
own age but they are all still at their
country homes mr trafford and i have
telephoned to every one we can think of
mrs goddard is prostrated and under the

argosy-allstory weekly
care of her physician when she returned
from orbits musicale and learned of hor-
aces disappearance she was almost beside
herself for he is our only child if any-
thing has happened to him-
  he ran his hand violently through his
scanty fringe of hair and mccarty ob-
served
    tis queer the lad didnt tell you him-
self that blaisdell was going away yester-
day
   he hasnt talked of him very much
lately goddard hesitated and then went
on  horace is an unusual boy-very sen-
sitive and reserved i dont pretend to un-
derstand him its what his mother calls the
artistic temperament i suppose he took
it very much to heart when we declined to
allow him to go on this sketching tour but
of course it was out of the question no
one but an artist would have suggested such
an impractical thing for a boy of his age
and with his frail constitution damn that
dog hell drive me out of my mind
  a doleful long drawn howl subdued but
eloquent reached their ears from below
stairs and mccarty remembered his brief
talk with the boy in that very room three
days before
   is that max the police dog your son
was telling me about when i called here
 yes he wandered around whining
until i couldnt stand it any longer and had
him shut up devilish clever animal and
devoted to horace-knows theres some-
thing wrong by god hear that mid-
night what can have happened to my
boy
   he dropped into a chair burying his face
in his hands as the clock struck and once
more dennis spoke
   have you any notion how much pocket
money the lad had this day
 it was trafford who replied to him
   six dollars and seventy-five cents i
am teaching him to keep a budget and he
carefully puts down whatever he spends
each day
    little and red headed wasnt he with
a narrow chest and spindling legs-
   riordan means is he small for his age
and kind of delicate looking mccarty
amended hastily glaring at the tactless in-
terrogator  how was he dressed when
you last saw him and whats missing from
his things
   he wore a brown pedestrian suit and
brown shoes and golf stockings the tutor
answered  he had a plain platinum wrist
watch on a leather strap and a gold seal
ring with the family coat of arms but noth-
ing else is missing except a brown cloth cap
with the manufacturers name  knowles
inside before communicating with you
mr goddard and i telephoned to every
hospital in the city fearing that some street
accident might have occurred but no child
whose appearance tallied in the least de-
gree with his had been brought in the
only remaining possibility is that he is being
detained somewhere for a ransom
   have you any other reason for think-
ing the lad may have been kidnaped
mccarty turned to goddard  know of
anybody with a grudge against you or your
family had any threatening letters
   great heavens no the bereaved fa-
ther raised his head  horry is a little
chap for fourteen looks nearer twelve in
fact and mr trafford usually accompanies
him when he leaves the mall but he begged
so hard to go to blaisdells studio by him-
self that i allowed it though it was against
his mothers wishes i wanted him to be
manly and self-reliant-and the madison
avenue cars pass blaisdells door near fif-
tieth i thought it was perfectly safe but
he may have been watched and marked by
some member of the criminal class as a vic-
tim for kidnaping
   that dont explain how or why he
passed out of one gate or the other with
not one on the whole block seeing him
mccarty shook his head  you say youre
wishful to avoid notoriety or id advise
you to report the lads disappearance to the
bureau of missing persons and let the in-
vestigation take its regular course but there
is a chance still that hes not been kid-
naped nor yet met with an accident twas
for riordan and me to try to locate him
and get him back without having the news-
papers getting out extras that you sent for
me to-night
  dennis caught his breath audibly at this
irregular supposition but goddard nodded
annihilation

   thats it exactly it would kill mrs
goddard to have the press make a sensa-
tional case of this while there is the slight-
est hope that horace may be restored to us
without publicity youll do what you can
ill pay anything a fortune to have my son
again safe
   well do our best mr goddard mc-
carty rose  if weve no news for you
by morning can we have a word with mrs
goddard then
   of course id take you to her now
but the doctor has given her something to
quiet her the servants dont know any-
thing ive questioned them till im hoarse
and been in touch with every one to whom
horry might have gone for gods sake
find my boy
  young trafford showed them out and
mccarty glanced keenly into his pale
troubled face as he held the door open he
seemed on the point of speech but glanced
back over his shoulder and then resolutely
closed his lips
  mccarty paused
   before we come in the morning youd
do well to tell the lads father to come
clean with us he admonished in a low-
ered tone  tis not by keeping anything
back that hell help
  trafford started
   do you think he is he countered
quickly  ive told you all i know at any
rate but let me hear if theres anything
more i can do ill sit up all night by the
telephone
   where are we going now dennis
asked as his companion turned toward the
east gate  twas to find who killed
hughes that the inspector made deputies
of us not to be chasing runaway kids but
im trailing right with you
   runaway is it i thought that was
your hunch when you asked what pocket
money the lad had and then described him
with more truth than politeness mc-
carty chuckled  you think hes gone to
join this artist fellow blaisdell twill be
easy to settle that when we find out where
that tour was to commence for horace
could not have gone far on six seventy-
five
   and we know how he got out all right
dennis supplemented  twas by that east
gate ahead when bill left it open so con-
venient look at orbits house do you
suppose his afternoon party is lasting on
through the night
  the awning and carpet were still
stretched from entrance door to curb
and seemingly borne upon the subdued
radiance of the glow which filtered through
the curtained windows of the conservatory
there came to them faintly the strains of
the organ it was no majestic harmony
this time however but a simple insistently
repetitive measure and mccarty paused to
listen shaking his head
   orbits by himself and just kind of
thinking through the organ cant you tell
the way hes just wandering along amusing
himself thats an easy little tune too
that would stick in your head come on
ive a notion to see a part of this mall weve
not thought to examine yet
   if theres a foot of it weve never been
over barring the insides of the other
houses- began dennis in obvious disap-
pointment  i thought wed be getting
after whoever takes care of blaisdells place
to find where hes gone-
   at this time of night snorted mc-
carty  has it come to you that god-
dard may not be so far wrong at that
especially if hes got some reason he hasnt
told for thinking the lad was stolen im
beginning to see the practical workings of
those books of mine you turn your nose up
at and i ask you did horace look to have
nerve enough to run away if he went out-
side these gates it was of his own free
will of course and during the time bill
left the one of them open but what if hed
been paid to do it what if the lad had
been decoyed outside how do we know
theres not others on the block concerned
in it
   others on the block repeated dennis
stopping short as they passed the dark bel-
lamy house  mac youre not thinking
there could be any connection between what
happened to hughes four days ago and the
goddard kids disappearance youre not
looking to have him found dead somewhere
poisoned glory be whats come to this
street all of a sudden

argosy-allstory weekly
   im asking myself that returned the
other grimly  im going no further in
my mind though just saying it looks fun-
ny-thats all heres a handful of rich
families living behind their gates in peace
and seclusion for generations with nothing
ever happening except maybe a funeral now
and then for they could not shut out death
then a murder takes place right in their
midst even if the victim did go far before
he dropped in his tracks and while theres
still no answer to it somebody in the next
house disappears
   so thats why you hinted at notoriety
if goddard took the case to headquarters
instead of leaving it to us were still on
the hughes affair after all exclaimed
dennis adding  whats down here
  mccarty had turned down the black pas-
sage or court between mrs bellamys and
the closed falkingham house next door on
the east and he vouchsafed no response
to the companion who followed curiously
at his heels until they had reached the
rear of the boarded-up residence then he
whispered cautiously
   got your flash light
  for answer dennis produced the pocket
electric torch without which he seldom
went on a nocturnal adventure with mc-
carty pressing the button mccarty
darted a minute but piercing ray of
light along the rear of the houses whose
front sidewalks they had just traversed
   see that denny he whispered  an
open court as clear as the palm of your
hand straight past the bellamys and orbits
to goddards on the corner if the kid had
wanted to get out without being seen he
might have left the back of his house and
come along this court to any of the pas-
sageways that lead out to the sidewalk
nearer the gate
   true for you dennis assented  turn
the light along the back wall till we see
how high it is and whether there are any
little doors in it or not
  but the wall not of brick but of ancient
brownstone was as high as the citys regu-
lations permitted blank and bare save in
the rear of orbits miniature palace where
it was covered by a thick impenetrable
curtain of ivy sable and glossylike black
satin in the moving finger of light
  all at once heavy footsteps pounded
along the sidewalk to the mouth of the pas-
sageway they had just left and a brighter
beam was trained suddenly upon them
dennis dodged instinctively but mccarty
turned and faced it calling cautiously
   is it you dave hollis weve not
gone yet just taking a look around
they had encountered the night watch-
man when they let themselves in at the west
gate earlier in response to eustace god-
dards summons and now he merely grunted
in acknowledgment and passed on
    theres nothing more to be seen here
dennis remarked  no one could cross
that wall without a ladder and though they
might climb that ivy it could not be done
carrying a boy the size of horace
   to say nothing of it being broad day
and the back windows of all the houses in
this row looking out at the performance
mccarty interjected  all the same well
stroll along to the goddards kitchen door
and back denny
  the rear of mrs bellamys mansion was
as dark as the front and in orbits also the
lights had by now been extinguished in
the dead stillness their stealthy footsteps
seemed to ring unnaturally loud to their
own ears only in the goddard house did
the dull glow from roof to cellar gleam forth
through shrouded windows like sleepless
anxious eyes
    tis almost unhealthy the cleanness of
everything dennis looked about him as
the flashlight circled over the spacious im-
maculate court  not an ash can nor so
much as a garbage pail that a cat could
hide behind were wasting our time here
mac
  but mccarty did not answer he had
gone halfway down the tradesmens passage
leading to the sidewalk and paused before a
door in the side wall of the goddard house
dennis saw the light play in narrowing
arcs over the paved ground before it and
then settle to a mere pinpoint as mccarty
stooped after a moment he straightened
and came swiftly back cat-footed despite
his bulk he was holding out some small
object in his extended hand and as he
annihilation

reached his companions side he played the
light upon it a small plain platinum watch
crushed beyond repair on a pathetically
short leather wristband
chapter x
the man in the shadows
the cold early light of a clouded morn-
ing found mccarty and dennis seated
over pancakes and coffee in an all
night restaurant on sixth avenue not far
from fiftieth street the intervening hours
since they left the new queens mall had
been fruitlessly spent in a weary round of
the ferries and railroad terminals in search
of news of a small solitary traveler now
they had just come from an interview with
the superintendent of the palatial studio
apartment building in which the artist
blaisdell resided
   i always thought those painter guys
lived in garrets with never a square meal
nor a second shirt dennis spoke in a
slightly dazed tone  i mind that day
watchman bill said young horace told him
blaisdell was one of the greatest in the
country but he must have some regular
business to be able to live in a place like
that theres one thing sure no matter
how much of a fancy hed took to the kid
he could afford to get into no trouble by
taking him on a tour without his father and
mother being willing and if the boy showed
up hed bring him back where is it again
that hes gone sketching
   up in the she-wan-gunk mountains
mccarty pronounced the name with pains-
taking care  ellenville is his headquar-
ters the superintendent said if you remem-
ber the detweiler house granting there
was a train and the lad had more money
with him than that four-eyed tutor suspect-
ed he could have got there by early eve-
ning but no word of any kind had come
when i phoned the goddard house an hour
ago
   i know dennis drained his cup and
held it out to the sleepy waiter to be re-
filled  tis too bad you did not tell traf-
ford about finding the watch
 and send him into hysterics hes as
bad as a woman now  mccarty shrugged
 the doctor d give orders mrs goddard
wasnt to be woke up till eight but well
chance it by seven how do you feel
denny
  dennis eyed the questioner with swift
suspicion
   theres nothing the matter with me that
i know of
   tis a pity mccarty commented cal-
lously  i was thinking if you called up
the lieutenant at the engine house and told
him how sick you were hed maybe let you
off duty the day theres a phone over
on the cigar counter
   and whats ailing me denniss eyes
sparkled but his tone was flat for his in-
ventive faculties were at low ebb in the early
morning
   from what ive learned lately denny
about mental defectives-
  but dennis had risen and stalking to the
counter he took up the phone presently
mccarty heard his voice raised in a harrow-
ing description of pain but it was abruptly
cut short and after listening for a moment
with a dazed look on his face he silently
replaced the receiver and returned to his
chair
  well demanded mccarty expect-
antly
    mikes out of the hospital and hell take
my nine to six shift
   but just what did the lieutenant say
to you
   he told me dennis replied very slowly
and distinctly  to get the hell off the
phone for id be no good at a false alarm
while my crook chasing side kick mccarty
was on the job again i gathered from a
few more remarks before he hung up on
me that your friend jimmie ballard of the
bulletin has been nosing around the engine
house to get dope from me about what
youre pulling off and by that same token
running the lieutenant ragged tis what i
get for associating with you
  it was mccartys turn to eye his com-
panion suspiciously but denniss stolid
countenance was quite devoid of humor
and he retorted
   is that so well wed better be as-
sociating ourselves with the goddards again

argosy-allstory weekly
now or therell be no news for jimmie or
the inspector either which is worse come
on
   unless the boy is found as hughes
was dennis suggested optimistically  it
would let the lindholms out but who ex-
cept a lunatic would be poisoning children
and servants promiscuouslike
  mccartys reply wras a stare and a grunt
which the other construed as derisive and
he lapsed into aggrieved silence as they
made their way once more to the gates be-
hind which so much of mystery and menace
brooded
  trafford opened the door almost before
the bell had ceased to echo through the
house and his haggard face was mute evi-
dence that the suspense had not been lifted
   have you- he could not voice the
rest of the question but mccarty replied
briskly
   weve several possibilities trafford
and were following every last one of them
up no news is good news just now is
mrs goddard awake yet do you know
   her maid told me when i inquired a
few minutes ago that she was stirring ill
go and see the young tutor turned dis-
piritedly away  youll find mr goddard
in the smoking room at the rear on the
avenue side
  in dimensions and ponderous style of fur-
nishing the smoking room resembled a club
lounge rather than a private apartment and
it was a full minute before they decried
eustace goddards rotund figure relaxed in
the depths of a huge leather armchair he
was apparently asleep but on their ap-
proach he opened widely staring eyes upon
them and sprang up with an inarticulate
cry
   weve not located your son yet mr
goddard mccarty spoke quickly before
the father could frame words  we know
what even minute means to you and tis
for that were going to bring the inspector
and some of his other men into it i can
promise you therell be no publicity through
us
   by god mccarty they can blazon it
in every paper in the land if it will bring our
boy back to us goddard cried brokenly
 the living horror of this night has made
everything else fade into insignificance
you mean you-youve failed
   not exactly sir but there are only the
two of us now and twill save time if others
take up some of the clews weve got mc-
carty explained
   theres the telephone goddard
waved a shaking hand toward a stand half
concealed behind a lacquered screen  get
the whole department if you need it ill
offer any reward you suggest-fifty thou-
sand a hundred
   weell settle that when the inspector
comes mccarty moved to the screen and
took up the receiver and dennis cleared
his throat
   how many doors are there to this
house
   four goddard replied in a surprised
tone  the one at the front two at the
rear-kitchen and tradesmens entrances-
and a smaller door at the side opening on
the court that runs between this house and
orbits but why do you ask what are
the clews youve found
  dennis coughed discreetly and from be-
hind the screen came mccartys voice
   is it yourself inspector yes me mc-
carty no at goddards and youre need-
ed wait a bit can you lay hands on
both martin and yost cant talk now
sir get me all right bring martin
along but send yost over to-to bill 
thats it maybe and maybe not sure
ive been in touch with bill and he knows
the party im looking for tell yost to
phone if anything turns up of course not
inspector till you take it in hand by
the last had been straight blarney but
dennis shivered as the receiver clicked on
its hook well he knew that telephone
number and the grim little house far over
toward the river where for a brief interval
the bluff kindly bill harbored the citys
unknown dead had the sickly little god-
dard heir after all gone the way of hughes
   why did you ask about the doors
the conversation had evidently held only
its obvious meaning for the man before
them  horace must have been induced
in some way to leave the house for no one
could have entered with trafford and all
the servants about
annihilation

   he did leave and by the side door
mccarty held out the shattered little wrist
watch  does this belong to the lad
   good god yes he wore it yester-
day   goddard seized it and then sank into
his chair its-smashed he must have
been handled brutally perhaps even-
   that dont follow sir mccarty inter-
rupted  the strap slips out of the buckle
easy for i tried it and the lad might have
dropped it without noticing anybody go-
ing to one of the back doors could have
come along and trod on it after for twas
in the alley right in front of the door that
i found it and now-
   mrs goddard is awake and ready to see
you now traffords voice sounded from
the threshold and goddard started up once
more
   she knows there is no news he asked
and at the tutors nod added  come then
but dont tax her beyond her strength and
dont mind any-any wild statements which
she may make my poor wife is almost out
of her mind
  of course we understand mccarty
darted a quick glance at dennis and then
turned to the tutor  trafford inspector
druet and another man are on their way up
from headquarters and youll be helping
matters if you tell the both of them whats
happened and all about them you phoned to
for trace of the lad
  in silence they followed goddard to the
tiny jewel box of an elevator whose velvet
and gold and glittering crystal mirrors made
dennis gasp he gasped again when their
guide pressed a button and they shot
abruptly upward and his weather-beaten
face turned a delicate green as they stopped
with a smooth but sickening swoop at the
second floor
  he was the first out with the opening of
the door but there was no time for the
aside which trembled on his lips for god-
dard led the way down the wide hall to the
doorway in which the gaunt gray-haired
figure of an elderly maid was silhouetted
against the dim light of the room within
   eustace a womans trembling voice
sounded from behind her  it cant be
that nothing is known nothing did you
tell them about that-
   everything is being done clara god-
dard motioned the maid aside and mccarty
and dennis followed him into the dressing
room they received only a confused im-
pression of mahogany and old rose and tall
mirrors of a faint aromatic perfume and
the sound of deep drawn convulsive breath-
ing
  the next moment their eyes were caught
and held by the long figure outstretched
upon a chaise longue imposing even in the
disheveled abandonment of grief mrs
goddard was a woman well over forty but
her distraught face still bore traces of the
beauty which must normally have been hers
there was no touch of gray in the masses
of luxuriant dark hair which the maid had
arranged with evident haste but that night
had etched lines about the fine eyes and
firm though sensitive mouth that would
never be erased
  as her husband went on speaking her
glance swept past him to the two who wait-
ed at his elbow
   everything that is humanly possible is
being done my dear goddard repeated
more emphatically  these are the police
officers i called in and they want to ask
you a few questions do you think you can
collect yourself enough to stick to facts and
not foolish morbid fancies
   i am quite collected eustace there
was a note almost of defiance in mrs god-
dards tones and she sat up among her pil-
lows with an unconscious dignity in spite
of the emotion which she held in check with
such obvious effort  ask me anything you
please i-i only want my baby safe once
more
   of course maam mccarty responded
soothingly  you went out and left the
lad on the couch in the library and when
you came back to get ready for the musicale
next door you thought he was with his
teacher now what was the first you knew
of his disappearance
   when i returned from the musicale it
was late after six and my husband met me
in the hall with the news he and mr
trafford had been telephoning everywhere
they thought horace might have gone to
some of our friends but he had never done
such a thing as to leave the mall without

argosy-allstory weekly
our knowledge and i knew that something
terrible had happened i could feel it-
here
  her slender very white hands flew to her
breast  i cannot blame mr trafford for
not starting the search for horace in the
early afternoon he supposed he had slipped
away to the studio of an artist who has
taken a great fancy to our little boy but
mr blaisdell is not in town
  the forced composure still held her and
only her fluttering hands and quick drawn
breath gave evidence of her supreme agita-
tion
   you dont think the lad has gone to
join him do you mccarty asked
   run away you mean mrs goddard
shook her head slowly  oh no horace
would never dream of such a thing mr
blaisdell wanted to take him but we would
not hear of it and horace had no idea of
disobeying our wishes he has never been
away from us before-before yesterday
   then you think he has been kidnaped
  at the question goddard who had moved
around to the other side of the couch took
a step forward the sagging muscles of his
round face tightening as his jaw tensed but
his wife did not take her eyes from those of
mccarty
  he isnt here her trembling voice
broke  he wouldnt run away the
earth didnt open and-and an avalanche
descend upon him it must have been that
man
 what man mccarty and dennis
spoke in chorus and then goddard placed
his hand on his wifes shoulder
  now clara he admonished you
promised-
    to give us facts mr goddard inter-
rupted mccarty sternly  if mrs god-
dard can tell us whatever it was you were
holding back last night so much the better
you phoned to me that the lad had been
kidnaped but you couldnt give me any rea-
son for thinking so except that he was gone
and you didnt breathe a word about any
 man  will you tell us maam
  theres nothing to tell goddard in-
sisted obstinately  my wife is nervous
imaginative and so is horace he was
badly frightened by a strange man here in
the mall a short time ago and his mother
was quite frantic about it it was some
days before she would allow him to go out
alone again but personally i think he exag-
gerated-
   our boy would not tell a falsehood
mrs goddard interrupted  it was just
at dusk one afternoon about a fortnight
ago or perhaps less when horace had re-
turned alone from mr blaisdells studio
he entered the mall by the east gate as
usual but stopped to play with a little
white persian kitten the pet of mrs bel-
lamys baby mrs bellamy lives just two
doors away next to mr orbits the
watchman had passed him and gone on to-
ward the west gate when all at once the
kitten darted across the street and horace
followed afraid that it might become lost
it ran into the open court between the
parsons house and the closed one next door
belonging to the quentin estate and horace
was stooping to coax it to him when he was
seized from behind by a strange man and
searched 
   searched echoed mccarty
   yes the man pressed horace back
against him with one hand over his mouth
and felt in all his pockets with the other
but he took nothing and never uttered a
word my little son was too startled to
struggle at first and all at once the man re-
leased him-and disappeared
   did the boy have any money with
him inquired dennis
   three or four dollars i believe but
the man left it untouched mrs god-
dards eyes shifted to those of the ques-
tioner  it was quite dark there in that
narrow space between the two houses but
horace saw the face which bent down over
his distinctly he said the man was an
utter stranger who he had never seen in the
mall before rough unshaven and desperate
looking
   which way did he go mccarty took
up the interrogation once more  was it
down the alley to the street or up in the
open court behind the houses
   how could the child tell goddard
interjected before his wife could speak  it
was almost dark and he was terror-
stricken  
annihilation

   horace told us that the man ran to-
ward the rear and disappeared in the shad-
ows of a doorway at-at the left mrs
goddard replied as though her husband had
not spoken
    at the left facing the rear of the houses
on the north side of the way mccarty
was thinking rapidly aloud  that  be
parsonss house then why didnt you
want us to know this mr goddard
   because it can have no possible bear-
ing on the disappearance of our son yester-
day goddard retorted hotly he ran
home immediately and told us and i insti-
tuted a thorough search without delay but
the watchman could find no trace of the
fellow and insisted he had admitted no
one that day through either gate who re-
sembled horaces description the par-
sonss servants had seen nothing of him
and he has not reappeared since although
a strict watch was kept it is madness to
suppose that horace left this house of his
own accord to meet the fellow when he
stood in mortal terror of him-
   not unless he met him accidental like
and got waylaid a second time dennis
broke in irrepressibly  theres no telling
what he was after if twas not money but
if he was crazy and the boy put up a bit
of a struggle-
   a-a-ah mrs goddards taut nerve
gave way and she broke into a low wrailing
cry  that is my fear no sane person
would harm him but all night long in hor-
rible dreams i have seen him- my baby
he is hidden somewhere helpless suffering
and i cannot reach him i shall go mad
mad
chapter xi
the closed house
a fine mess you made of that mc-
carty remarked disgustedly when
the door of mrs goddards dressing
room had closed behind them shutting in
her husband and the maid  just when
we were on the point of getting at the truth
too
   truth is it dennis retorted  i
suppose you mean youd have been finding
out what the crazy guy expected to find in
the boys pockets
  no i know that already mccarty
emitted a grim chuckle  twill keep
though for weve got quick work ahead of
us now and the inspector must have been
waiting this long while
   you can shoot yourself down in that
gilt birdcage if youve a mind to but my
own legs will carry me dennis eyed the
elevator door cunningly concealed in the
high oak paneling of the hall with a hos-
tile glare then he added sarcastically
 ive no doubt but that by the new book
learning youve got lately you know who
the guy was too and where he came from
and how he got out through solid walls and
barred gates education is a grand thing
but where is horace answer me that
 if were not able to answer that soon
denny im thinking it would be best left
unanswered forever for the sake of that
woman back there mccarty spoke with
deep earnestness  theres a feeling in
me that weve something working against us
more than human-something worse than
lightning or the plague even if we could
onlv see our way clear to the black heart
of it
  they went down the stairs together to
find the inspector and martin awaiting
them with trafford who appeared crushed
from the gruelling half hour through which
he had passed
  mccarty addressed him first with a mere
nod to his superior
   trafford why didnt you tel me about
the man who grabbed the lad in the alley
not two weeks ago
  mr goddard forbade me the
wretched young man stammered then drew
himself up with a vain assumption of dig-
nity  since it has nothing to do with the
case-
  were the best judge of that mc-
carty w-aved him away peremptorily
 tell goddard well see him later now
inspector before we talk if youll follow
a suggestion of mine just once more theres
a train martin will be after catching and
hell have to hustle to do it
  the inspector eyed him keenly for a mo-
ment and then nodded

argosy-allstory weekly
   go to it he said briefly  get the
instructions martin
  mccarty drew the young operative aside
and after a brief interchange of words the
latter took his departure then the in-
spector motioned the other two into the li-
brary and closed the door
   now i want an explanation of this
he announced in a tone which took mc-
carty swiftly back to the old days  why
didnt you report to me at once when you
learned what had happened what have
you two been doing since i made you
deputies but by the lord i didnt appoint
you chiefs
  mccarty told him in detail of their ac-
tivities during the previous night and add-
ed frankly
   i didnt report inspector because i
wanted a few hours the start of you and
thats the truth so far ive only done
what i think you would have yourself
but im working from an angle of my own
that youd not have taken ive sent mar-
tin just now to ellenville to find out if this
blaisdell has heard anything of the lad but
thats only routine the real job is here in
the mall even if horace turns up dead or
alive somewhere else
   whats this angle of yours on the
case the inspector demanded curtly
 what did goddard forbid that tutor men-
tioning and why
  mccarty described the interview with
mrs goddard and the inspector listened
attentively asking when he had finished
   what do you propose to do put the
screws on goddard to find out why he kept
that back he cant be a party to the
kidnaping of his own son
   no but he thinks he knows who the
fellow was and that hell hear from him
or them back of him soon with a view to
ransom hes ready to offer fifty or a hun-
dred thousand reward whenever you give
the word until he does hear from him
though he cant be sure what happened
to the lad and thats why hes anxious his
wife dont know anything about this pri-
vate opinion of his of course and natural-
ly shes half crazed
  mccarty summed up as though his proc-
ess of deduction was equally clear to his
two companions  well leave him worry
awhile for tis my opinion hes mistaken
entirely i want a look now inside that
empty house next to the parsonses across
the street and theres no time to wait for
red tape to get permission
   the quentin house thats been closed
all these years the inspector looked fix-
edly at him and dennis gaped  you
think the fellow might have hidden there
after letting the little boy go come on
well take a chance
  a huge dark blue limousine of impres-
sive aspect was just drawing up before
no  as they emerged from the goddard
house and crossed the street and at sight
of the distinguished gray-bearded man
who alighted and went up the steps the in-
spector halted with an exclamation
   do you know who that is mac the
ambassador that the mayor gave the keys
of the city to only yesterday down at city
hall if he comes himself to call on the
parsons theyre of more importance even
than i thought
   and tis small wonder they dont
bother to associate with the rest on the
block millionaires or no mccarty com-
mented eying the equipage with vast re-
spect as they passed  you said the old
gentleman was-
  he paused suddenly and denniss eyes
followed his to the great entrance doors
which were closing slowly behind the aris-
tocratic back of the ambassador there
was just a glimpse of a thin sallow-faced
manservant in black who appeared to sweep
the trio with a curiously penetrating gaze
and then the scene was shut out
  mccarty seemed to have lost interest in
the question he was about to ask and they
went on in silence to the narrow paved
court between the parsons residence and
the vast rambling pile of brownstone next
door
   lets go up here and see if the rear is
open for the length of the block the way
it is on the other side of the street mc-
carty suggested  theres parsonss side
door the one horace said the man disap-
peared into its pretty deep you see deep
enough for him to have stepped into the
embrasure and been hid in the shadows of
annihilation

late afternoon without actually going
through the door itself though i dont say
he didnt at that
   tis likely a nut thatd go around grab-
bing children and searching their pockets
would be let into the parsonses dennis
exclaimed in fine scorn  unless the boy
made the whole thing up for a sensation
the way some kids do howd the man get
in and out of the block the house on
this side looks to be boarded up as tight
as a drum
  they reached the rear and found the
open court extending along behind the
houses to be even wider than that on the
south side of the street the back wall high-
er and devoid of a single vine the silent
quentin house presented as blank an as-
pect as from the front its sealed windows
and barred doors staring like blind eyes in
the sunlight and the inspector shook his
head
   no one has entered here in months
years maybe he remarked  the pad-
locks are so rusted on those board doors
that they would have to be broken and
the boards themselves are weatherbeaten
and rotting im surprised theyd let the
place get into such a condition even though
it is in litigation what are you doing
riordan
  the house being the corner one was
built around in an ell on the madison ave-
nue side and in the right angle formed by
its two walls a leader descended from the
roof dennis was examining and testing it
speculatively and at the inspectors ques-
tion he turned
   do you mind sir twas a wide shiny
mark burnished on a pipe running across the
top of an air shaft that showed mac and
me how a murderer had swung himself
down on a rope and in at a window in the
first case ever he butted in on after he left
the force he asked  this rain pipe
looks to be too frail to bear the weight of a
cat but tis not a cat rubbed the rust off
here and here so it shines like a new tin
i put on a clean shirt yesterday mores the
pity but hold my coat and hat mac
   mind or youll break your neck mc-
carty warned forgetful of his friends call-
ing as he complied dennis scorned to re-
ply but swarmed up the straining creak-
ing ieader to the second floor swinging out
to land as lightly and sure-footedly as the
cat he had metaphorically mentioned on
the broad sill of a window two feet away
the leader released suddenly from his
weight tore loose from its fastening and
canted crazily against the angle of the wall
shaking and clattering and mccarty ex-
claimed
   youll not be coming down the way you
went up
  true for you dennis sang out with
a note of rising excitement  ill be com-
ing down the way the last guy did who lit
here and thats by the inside wait you
there for me
  he had been examining the sill upon
which he stood and the boards which cov-
ered the window pressing experimentally
upon the latter and all at once one of
them gave way forced inward with an ac-
companying crash of glass
  now youve done it mccarty ob-
served superfluously  look out there is
not more than us waiting for you inside
 ive my flash light thanks be and my
two fists dennis responded  that
board wasnt tight the nails had just been
stuck back in the holes here goes an-
other
  with the rending of wood the second fol-
lowed the first and with a third which he
wrenched loose dennis smashed in the
fragments of glass which still clung to the
sash and then wriggled lithely through the
aperture and disappeared mccarty drew
a long breath and turned to his former su-
perior
   id like to be following him he said
wistfully  if so be some guy is hiding in
there-the same one that grabbed the lad
-hell be desperate enough to kill and
dennys too slow-thinking and slow-mov-
ing to take care of himself im heftier
than him and tis long since i did any
shinnying but maybe that pipe would hold
me after all
   a man with four medals from the fire
department for meritorious conduct and
conspicuous bravery doesnt need a nurse-
maid mac the inspector responded with
a laugh  personally i dont believe any

argosy-allstory weekly
ones been in there for months before him
but-whats that
   that  was a sudden subdued commo-
tion within a long-sustained clatter fol-
lowed by a reverberating thud and then a
silence ominous in its intensity
  i knew it mccarty dropped the
hat and coat and made for the wooden bar-
rier that sealed the main back door  im
going in if i break the whole damn place
down denny denny im coming
  his reassuring roar was lost in the mighty
smash of his fist on the rotting boards but
after the first blow the inspector reached
him and dragged him back
   have you taken leave of your senses
the latter demanded  youll have the
whole block aroused to find us breaking
and entering riordans all right there
 hear somebody moving about inside
listen 
  mccarty waited panting and tense and
faintly there came to his ears the sound as
of stumbling footsteps within and a
scratching noise from a window at the left
of the door which being protected by an
iron grillework had been left unboarded
a heavy green shade hung close against
the inner side of the dirty window pane
furrowed by many past rain storms and
the stout bars seemed at a glance to be
firmly imbedded in the broad stone sill but
mccarty strode to them and began trying
them one by one while behind him the in-
spector drew his revolver and stood ex-
pectant
  look here sir mccarty whispered
 tis fine burglar protection theyve got
in these houses see how this bar slides
up into its groove in the top of the case-
ment till you can pull it out below and
down over the sill entirely ill bet the
next will work the same it does if wed
taken the trouble to find this out at first-
glory be heres denny himself
  the green shade had flown up and the
face of dennis appeared in a sickly yellow
aura cast by his flash light but he prompt-
ly extinguished it and set to w-ork on the
catch of the window as mccarty removed
the fourth bar the sash opened upward
and the two who had meanwhile been ex-
changing grimaces pregnant with meaning
gazed silently at each other for a full min-
ute then mccarty found his voice
   where is he he demanded  what
did you do with him wte heard the row
out here-
   there wasnt any  him  dennis in-
terrupted sheepishly  it was me by my-
self i came on the stairs unexpected like
and took the whole flight of them without
even breaking my flash light but come
in the both of you and see what i found
mccarty scrambled over the sill and in-
spector druet despite his added years fol-
lowed with the effortless ease of a boy
they found themselves in a large room
bare of furniture but in the dust which
lay like a heavy carpet upon the floor a
meandering trail of footsteps many times
traversed ran from the window by which
they had entered to a connecting door open-
ing into a laundry dusty finger-marks
with here and there the imprint of a whole
hand were plainly outlined on the white
woodwork of the inner sill and below it
greasy pieces of wrapping paper were scat-
tered while in a comer tw pitchers and
several small tin cans were heaped
   some one has been camping out here
thats evident the inspector remarked
 getting his food handed in to him through
that window too
   and it wasnt any ordinary bought
stuff the kind that comes ready fixed in
stores mccarty was poking about in
the papers  heres the carcass of a whole
chicken pieces of fancy rolls and pastry
and other stuff but its all stale its been
here for four or five days at least
   and theres traces of coffee in those
pitchers and cans to say nothing of the
wine bottles on that shelf dennis point-
ed impatiently  hes been living on the
fat of the land from one of the houses in
this row and the nearer the likelier even
if it does happen to be occupied by them
high-and-mighty parsons come upstairs
till i show you more
  the larger adjoining room must have
been the laundry for rows of enameled
tubs and washing machines were ranged
against the wall and driers stood about
but all were covered with a thick blanket
of dust dennis led the way through a se
                         	a
annihilation

ries of kitchens and pantries far more elabo-
rate than those they had encountered in
orbits house to the back stairs and up
to the second floor rear into the room with
the broken window all the way they had
followed that zigzag trail of overlapping
footsteps and here the floor was crossed
and recrossed by a network of them this
apartment had evidently been one of the
master bedrooms for a well-appointed
marble-lined bath opened from it and
heavy old-fashioned furniture of richly
carved mahogany inlaid with tarnished gilt
marquetry was ranged with stiff precision
about the room a half-burned candle
shielded from the window by an old card-
board box cover stood on a side table to-
gether with a handful of matches and some
cigarette stubs and mccarty pointed to it
   he couldnt live without a light but he
hid it from the window and he didnt dare
carry it when he went down to get his
food thats why those footprints rambled
so he was feeling his way in the dark
that bed looks as if it had been slept in
with all those old draperies piled on it
and whats in that big pitcher on the bu-
reau
   water dennis replied  theres still
a little left though you can see from the
marks on the inside where it has dried
down
   evaporated the inspector nodded
 that would show too that whoever the
fellow was he hadnt used any of it for a
few days at least hello whats this
  he had turned to the bathroom and
after a moment he emerged from it holding
a bright new razor a piece of soap and
a very dirty turkish towel
   the water has been turned off in the
pipes of course but there is an empty
bucket in there in which some must have
been brought to him and he seems to have
had some regard to his personal appearance
at least the goddard boy said the man
who had tackled him was rough looking
and unshaved didnt he
 when he tackled him yes mccarty
replied  he had chance enough to clean
up after as soon as whoever was helping
him to hide here brought him the things
he did more than that dennis de
 	a
clared there was an unwonted flush on
his leathery cheeks and his gray eyes were
alight with excitement  why do you sup-
pose he was hiding here anyway why
does anybody hide if tis not to do some-
thing unlawful couldnt he have broken
the law already and be hiding from it
denny mccarty breathed what
are you getting at youve found out
something who is the man
   whos wanted now inspector den-
nis asked  somebody thats gentleman
enough to keep shaved and clean in spite
of everything whod appreciate good food
and wine and the best in life and yet was
a convicted criminal for all that
    convicted-  mccarty started for-
ward  an ex-crook do you mean how
did you guess-
    ex-crook nothing  retorted his con-
feree  im not up in the latest of prison
styles but if this aint a penitentiary get-
up im an orangeman
  he flung open a closet door behind him
dived in and dragged forth in triumph a
telltale suit of stained and ragged gray
   sing sing exclaimed inspector druet
 good lord riordan youve made a find
do you remember mac that three men
escaped last month one was killed mak-
ing his get-away and another caught and
transferred to dannemora but the third of
those that crushed out then is still at large
and theres a big reward out heaven
knows how he managed to get into the
mall and why he should have come here
of all places but ill stake my life that the
man who has been hiding in this house is
george radley
chapter xii
the breath of death
 who is he asked dennis wide
 eyed  who is this george rad-
 ley
   you remember dont you mac the
inspector turned to the ex-roundsman
 radley was a young chemist-
 a chemist caroled mccarty and
dennis in unison then their mouths shut
like traps and they stared at each other

argosy-allstory weekly
   whats got into you two inspector
druet demanded  this radley was ac-
cused together with an accomplice of send-
ing poison to a mutual enemy concealed in
candy an innocent member of the mans
household ate it and died but the actual
evidence against the accused was so weak
that they could only be convicted of man-
slaughter after two disagreements and then
the accomplice only got two or three years
and radley ten hell have several more
to serve yet however even allowing for
good behavior and then too a guard was
seriously injured in trying to prevent that
crush-out so hes wanted bad he could
never have got as far as the city in those
clothes
   he had others outside of em either
stole or slipped to him dennis returned
to the closet and produced a pair of de-
lapidated shoes gray trousers and a long
mackinaw together with a soft panama
hat  only the shoes are ragged you see
the rest is in pretty good condition and
theres an umbrella in a corner of the
closet he could have got past the watch-
man easy on a rainy night especially if he
said he was coming to see a maid maybe
in one of the houses still that dont ac-
count for his grabbing the goddard kid if
twas him and going through his pockets 
   his clothes may be a find but weve
not got himself yet what if hes hid
under this roof now mccarthy exclaimed
 hed have no call to harm the goddard
lad unless horace found out he was here
and was going to give him away but harm
or no if so be hes had no chance to es-
cape 
  youre right mac the inspector
dropped the clothes he had been examining
and started for the door  well smoke
him out
  but a painstaking search of the great
house from attic to cellar failed to reveal
any further trace of the refugee and they
departed at last through the open window
in the basement to round the corner into the
court and come face to face with bill jen-
nings
   mr parsonss butler next door sent
me the watchman explained  he said
somebodys heard a noise in there and id
better see about it nothing wrong i hope
inspector
  open curiosity rang in his tones but
the official replied brusquely
   nothing well go over the other
empty houses on the block later its all
right
   whats this weve been hearing about
a strange man who scared the goddard lad
in this very court not two weeks ago mc-
carty asked as they approached the side-
walk once more
  bill jennings looked uncomfortable
   there was no strange man got between
these gates while i was on he averred
defensively  it must have been some
butler or houseman that works on the block
trying to play a joke on the little feller it
was a week ago saturday that he raised
the rumpus about it but there wasnt any
sign of the rough-looking kind of guy he
described when trafford and i looked and
we went over every foot of the courts
theres mr orbit motioning
  it was to the inspector and his deputies
however that orbit beckoned and when
they had crossed to him he asked with
grave concern
   is it true that horace goddard cannot
be found one of the maids from next
door told jean and that you had been no-
tified but i couldnt believe it trafford
came to my house yesterday afternoon
though inquiring for him-but i forgot
mccarty and riordan were present is it
possible that the little boy hasnt been seen
since
   not so far as weve been able to dis-
cover the inspector responded  its a
pretty bad business if he was a normal
healthy mischievous kid wed be apt to
think he ran away but from all accounts
he was sickly and timid not the kind to
strike out for himself
   horace is very nervous and highly
strung with remarkable artistic possibili-
ties orbit observed thoughtfully  im
immensely interested in him and my friend
blaisdell is of the opinion that hell become
a great painter some day if his people dont
kill his aspirations by lack of sympathy
like a sensitive plant he needs encourage-
ment nurturing but what can have hap-
annihilation

pened to him if he isnt with friends or
relatives the child must have met with an
accident has an alarm been sent out
   were trying every way to locate him
he used to run in and out of your house a
lot didnt he did you ever hear him
speak of any one he might have gone to
now the inspector asked  we know
of course how disappointed he was when
his father and mother wouldnt let him go
on a sketching tour with this mr blaisdell
you mention but he seems to have got
over it do you know if he had any boy
friends his own age
  orbit shook his head
   none he is a solitary little chap
self-contained and retiring and i dont
think he cares very much for the society
of other boys he would not have gone
away and remained like this without a word
if he was able to communicate with his
family it seems inexplicable goddard
must be dreafully cut up about it to say
nothing of the boys mother and i feel
badly myself i should hate to think of
any accident happening to him im going
in to see goddard and ask if there is any-
thing i can do meanwhile youve no news
for me about hughess strange death have
you it is odd that two such mysterious
unrelated incidents should have occurred in
less than a week even though hughes must
have taken the poison either accidentally or
through some ones murderous intent after
he left the mall that night havent you
come upon the slightest indication
   were working on several promising
ones the time-worn formula was repeated
a trifle wearily  let you know when there
is anything to give out mr orbit come
on mac-its nearly noon
  orbit turned toward the goddard house
but the others had scarcely gone a half
dozen steps in the opposite direction when
again they were halted this time it was
by the pretty little french nurse and she
drew the bellamy baby closer gazing at
mccarty with wide affrighted eyes as she
voiced her question
   pardon monsieur but is it of a truth
that which i have heard must it be that
the little garqon of that house there is
lost
   thats about the size of it maam
mccarty removed his reblocked derby with
a flourish  i dont suppose you saw him
playing around anywheres yesterday after-
noon
   but no she caught her breath with
a slight gasp  all the night he has been
depart alorsl it is terrible that he is so
gentle so good the little horace he
would not run away is it that he have
been stole me i have fear for the little
maude-
  she hugged her small charge tighter and
the baby stared at them solemnly
  there aint much danger of that
mccarty laughed reassuringly  i guess
the lad will turn up all right when did
you see him last
   yesterday morning when he have
passed with m trafford oh if he has
been keednap wre do not go beyond these
gates 
  she nodded and led the child away slow-
ly while dennis remarked
   pretty and a lady but did you ever
hear the like of such lingo no wonder
them french have a fit when they talk tis
from trying to understand each other
mccarty darted a quick glance at the
harassed frown on the inspectors face and
then replied to his companion
   she had it straight though horace
has been depart all right and if we dont
get him back soon therell be a bigger howl
than ever from the chief isnt that what
youre thinking sir
  the inspector nodded gloomily
   im going to the agents in charge of
these houses and get the keys he indi-
cated the two closed residences east of mrs
bellamys  try to get a line meanwhile
on who slipped food to the man hiding over
there and what became of him and meet
me here in an hour
   its not much hes wanting dennis
remarked as the inspector left them abrupt-
ly and strode toward the gate  still if
we could trace what cellar them wine bot-
tles came from that was stacked up on the
shelf in that empty house- look the
ambassadors limousine is going away
  the impressive dark blue car was indeed
moving slowly away from the curb in front

argosy-allstory weekly
of the parsons house and the great front
door closing they caught another fleeting
glimpse of the sallow faced manservant and
then mccarty exclaimed
   come on i want a few words with the
butler over there anyway and maybe the
old gentleman himself and dont be putting
in your oar denny and rocking the boat
i know what im after
  dennis followed in injured silence and
they mounted the steps of the stately house
iand rang the bell a lengthy pause en-
sued mccarty was about to ring again
when the door opened suddenly and the
manservant whom they had seen a moment
before stood confronting them he paid
no heed to dennis but his dull sunken eyes
fastened themselves on mccarty and as
he stared his sallow cheeks seemed to
whiten
   hello porter you remember me i
see the latter said brusquely  me and
my friend here want to have a little talk
with you
   my names not porter its roberts
the man replied stiffly with an evident effort
 youve made a mistake
  not me my lad mccarty spoke
with easy assurance  inspector druet got
you too the other day but he didnt bother
you then because we didnt know as much
as we do now
   by god youll never frame me again
the man shrank back and a harsh grating
note came into his low tones  you
havent got anything on me
   havent hey how about the neigh-
bor youve had next door for the past week
or so mccarty inquired while dennis
held his breath  look here porter i sup-
pose you have been pretty well hounded
and i dont want to be hard on you but im
going to get the truth
  neighbor the pseudo roberts
moistened his dry lips  i dont know what
youre talking about
   maybe mr parsons does then well
see him mccarty made as though to push
his way past the cowering figure and the
man threw out his hands
   for gods sake dont just when hes
giving me the only square chance ive had 
it was more an agonized whisper than
speech  im porter all right but he
knows that he knows i got railroaded
and you bulls wouldnt let me go straight
afterward thats why he took me in i
dont know what youre trying to hang on
me now but youre not going to drag him
into it what do you want of me
  mccarty glanced down the long hall
which seemed almost bare in its lofty aus-
terity in spite of the richness of the carved
paneling and quaint old furniture
   take us some place where we can talk
without anybody butting in mccarty sug-
gested  its for your own sake man if
youll come clean-
  ive heard that before porter
shrugged with a shadow of a dreary smile
 come along back to my pantry if you
want to but why dont you take me right
down town now and be done with it if
youre out to frame me cut all the bluff
 did i ever demanded mccarty
 did i ever try to send you or any other
guy up unless i had the straight goods on
them
   i guess not mac i havent got any-
thing against you but ive had a rough
deal whats come now is just the luck of
the game i suppose
  he closed the pantry door carefully be-
hind them and motioning to chairs he
leaned back against the table gripping its
edge with his thin hands
   what do you want to know ill come
clean all right-about myself
  mccarty noted the almost imperceptible
pause and asked quickly
   how long have you been out this
time
   a year and a half my lungs went
back on me and i would have been a goner
if i hadnt got pardoned but what good
did it do me every time i got a job
clerking in a drug store one of the narcotic
squad came along with my record and i
was kicked out my record god and
i wasnt guilty i never knew my boss was
crooked and in with the dope ring making
me the scapegoat
  his voice had roughened again with a
sort of savage earnestness  i was about
at the end of my rope but the-the man
whod had me pardoned was keeping his eye
annihilation

on me all the time and saw how hard id
tried and-and so mr parsons took me on
here to give me a breathing spell any-
thing else-about me-you want to know
 yes mccarty replied on a sudden in-
spiration  you were tried with radley
werent you and convicted of sending that
poisoned candy-
  he paused and porter shrugged again
   whats the comedy for you got that
from headquarters and nobodys making a
secret of it it was that old charge the
record of that first case that convicted me
again and it helped convict radley too
for we were both of us innocent but what
is the use of telling that to you now
   therell be a lot of use in telling us
for your own sake what you had to do with
the crush-out last month
   nothing i havent been outside these
gates since i came in june
   then you didnt know anything about
it till radley showed up here a couple of
weeks ago
   i dont know anything about it now
except what i read in the papers porter
faced him squarely  what do you mean
about radley showing up
   you didnt hide him in that empty
house next door and smuggle food and
drinks and a razor and clothes in to him
did you mccarty paused for a moment
again but porter maintained a dogged si-
lence and he went on  does benjamin
parsons know of it twill be news to him
to hear that after him taking you in and
all youve been making him accessory after
a crush-out-
   hes accessory to nothing porter in-
terrupted  i know the law for i have
bitter reason to hes a fine old man and
believes in giving everybody a fair chance
especially if theyve been framed but hed
do nothing against the law even if he thinks
its in the wrong youve no proof that
radley was here or that any one helped
him to hide but im glad he made his get-
away-glad i hope to god hes never
caught to go back to that hell
   even though you go now mccarty
demanded  youve one chance to keep
clear of it porter and youll not be giving
radley away either were wise already
that twas you helped him to hide and then
make his get-away but tis not radley we
are after now except as the alarm has gone
out to the whole force were on another
lay entirely but we just want to find out
when he beat it away from the mall and
how he got out i never gave my word
yet that i broke it and im giving it now
that twill not be from me nor riordan
either a hint will get out about your part in
all this
   you mean youre not here to frame me
nor kid me into snitching on radley a
faint tremor of hope ran through his tones
as he gazed searchingly into the honest
square jawed face before him  youve
got a name for fair play mac and youre
on to enough already to put me away again
if you want to so what i tell you cant
matter it wont hurt george radley either
as it happens
  dennis started violently and mccarty
asked
   why cant it you dont mean hes
croaked
   i mean i dont know any more than
you do when he beat it or how he passed
the gates and thats the gods truth
porter responded slowly his gaunt sallow
face twitching  i read about his escape
in the papers as i told you and when the
days passed and he wasnt caught i was
happy thinking he had got clean away but
i never dreamed of him turning up here
   late one afternoon though-never
mind how long ago-i opened the side door
to find him all but leaning against it weak
from hunger and thirst and fairly desper-
ate hed got past the watchman during
a rainstorm a night or two before to try to
reach me his old pal and hed been hiding
in that empty house next door without food
or water not daring to come openly and ask
for me when i didnt show myself he made
up his mind to beat it but he found he
couldnt get out as easy as hed got in and
he was near crazy
   that  be a week ago last saturday
mccarty nodded  when you came on him
he was just after grabbing a kid that lives
on the block here and searching his pockets
to see could he find if the lad had a key to
the gates

argosy-allstory weekly
   glory be dennis ejaculated beneath
his breath
   yes he was half off his head but he
didnt hurt the boy any-only scared him
i made him go back next door and lay low
till the search was over and after nightfall
i took him some bread and meat and a bot-
tle of rare old port from the cellar it was
stealing and poor return for all the old
gentleman has done for me but george
needed it bad and i figured i owed most
to him he needed clothes too but mine
fitted him and i didnt have to steal money
for him either because the old gentleman
pays me good
   the trouble was how to get him
through the gates for after the scare hed
given the boy both watchmen were leery of
strangers and if he was held up and ques-
tioned i knew hed go to pieces from the
long strain hed been under and it would be
all up with him
  porter reached for a silver jug of ice
water which stood on the table beside him
and drank deeply then replaced it with a
sigh of relief  no one has keys except
the families themselves and id no chance
to borrow miss parsonss of course nor
her niece-miss hesters the old gentle-
man carries his on a ring and sleeps with
it under his pillow and though i tried twice
to get it he woke up both times i had a
job of it to explain what i was doing in his
room and i didnt dare risk it again
george was getting wild with the waiting
and worry and took to prowling out at
night in spite of all i could say i was get-
ting pretty desperate myself when all at
once hed gone and thats all i know
  mccarty rose
   when did you see him last
   sunday night late when i went to
take him some food i handed it in through
the window and we talked for a minute
but i didnt dare stay longer george was
almost ready to give himself up for his
nerve was gone and it was all i could do
to persuade him to wait wed arranged
that i was to go to him every other night-
i couldnt risk it oftener-so i didnt miss
him monday last evening i got some
rolls a cold pheasant and a half bottle of
burgundy and waited under the window
as long as i dared but he didnt come and
finally i took down the loose iron bars and
let myself in there wasnt the least sign
of a light from his candle and he didnt
answer when i took a chance and called
so i left the food and came away but i
was awake all night worrying and toward
morning i went back and got the stuff
which hadnt been touched i was afraid
cook would miss the pheasant and it might
be found and traced i never thought about
the wine bottles
   so he might have got away any time
from sunday night on
   thats right im giving it to you
straight mac and i knew when i saw you
an hour ago that youd be after me sooner
or later especially when miss parsons-the
old gentlemans sister miss priscilla-heard
a noise next door and told me to notify the
watchman i was afraid it was all up with
us last week when inspector druet came
but it was about that valet from across
the street who was poisoned and the in-
spector didnt even let on he recognized
me
   do you know the kid that radley tried
to get a key off of mccarty ignored the
observation
   only by sight red haired isnt he
and lives next door to where that valet
worked i see him now and then going
by on the other side of the street
   have you seen him since he got that
scare
   oh yes porter smiled faintly in sur-
prise  only a day or so ago george did
not mean to scare him-he wouldnt harm a
fly
   youve been here since june you say
porter did you know that valet who
died
   no i think ive seen him with the
butler from the next house but i dont
want to know any of them i was glad
enough to stay here and do a servants work
myself till i could get my nerve back to go
out and hunt up my own kind of a position
again where the bulls wouldnt keep moving
me on
  he smiled again but bitterly  i guess
there isnt a chance of that now with you
on im not sorry though id do it again
annihilation

for george he was innocent the same as
me and look what was done to him
   if i find youve come clean ill keep
my word porter mccarty reiterated as
he moved toward the door with dennis in
tow  you may not know it but im not
on the force any longer nor connected with
headquarters except to mix in now and
then for old times sake and the inspector
didnt recognize you the other day he kind
of knew your face but he couldnt place
you riordan and me will just forget you
laid eyes on radley unless it comes to a
showdown and then well do what we can
cutting short the ex-convicts broken
thanks they took their departure to find
inspector druet pacing impatiently back
and forth before the two closed houses op-
posite
   did you get any dope from parsons
the inspector asked
   we didnt even see him mccarty par-
ried  i was getting a line on the ser-
vants do you recall saying youd seen
one or two of them before have you
thought where
   lord no ive had enough else on my
mind i had an idea one of the housemaids
and the page boy who runs errands looked
familiar but there wasnt anything out of
the ordinary about them
  dennis coughed and mccarty remarked
hastily
   i guess none of them knows whats be-
come of the man who has been hiding next
door nor anything about the goddard lad
and thats all that matters right now isnt
it sir did you get the keys to these
houses
   yes and explained again to that fool
of a watchman jennings i had time to
look around pretty thoroughly outside them
while i waited for you and i couldnt find
a window or door that had been tampered
with but well see whats inside
  one oclock had come and gone and
another hour passed before they emerged
from the second of the two houses after a
fruitless search dust and mold were all
they had encountered in the huge echoing
partially dismantled rooms and the foot-
prints they themselves left behind them
were the only recent signs of human pres-
ence
  dennis blinked and drew in the fresh air
deeply when they stood once more in the
sunlight
   tis like coming out of a tomb he
said  whats it to be now inspector
   im going to goddard and make him
talk that official responded with a certain
grimness which was eloquent  until he
comes across with his suspicions as to who
kidnaped the boy our hands are tied and
every hour counts you two had better
get a bite to eat and meet me at his house
later
  nothing loth they accepted the hint and
it was mid-afternoon before they ap-
proached the east gate of the mall again
to find jennings energetically engaged in
driving away a swarthy vendor of toy bal-
loons whose basket freighted with globes
of bright crude color bobbing on slender
sticks resembled an uprooted garden patch
   theyre a pest those peddlers he de-
clared as he admitted them  theyre not
as bad though as the reporters that have
been trying to get in since you left say
did you know horace goddard is lost
   sure we know it mccarty interrupt-
ed  didnt trafford tell you so himself
yesterday afternoon hurry denny
leaving the watchman staring speechless-
ly they quickened their pace toward the
goddard house and were passing the en-
trance door of orbits when it was flung
open and ching lee appeared
  for once the chinamans wooden impas-
sivity had deserted him his slant eyes
were rolling wildly his yellow face distort-
ed as he plunged down the steps and seized
mccarty with an iron grip
   the nurse-baby he babbled his sing-
song voice high and shrill  the flench
maid of next door baby come quick
   lucette do you mean the bellamy
childs nurse mccarty halted  stop
chattering like a monkey and tell me where
she is and whats the matter
   lucette ching lee nodded vigorous-
ly and pointed in at the -open windows of
the conservatory  she is the next she
has breathed the breath of death
to be continued next week
by george m johnson
tom willoughby started to step
on the gas but changed his mind
and stepped on the brake instead as
the car he was on the point of passing
swerved abruptly to the left
   whats that crazy fool think hes try-
ing to do he growled angrily
  a moment later with a clear road ahead
tom sent out an ear-piercing blast from his
horn and swept on by the offending car
shooting a side glance over at the driver
as he did so
   might have known it all the time he
muttered  its a woman driving
  his wife alicia in the seat beside him
pressed her lips firmly together in resent-
ment at the contempt in his tone
   you make me awfully mad when you
talk that way tom said she  just as
many men do boobish things on the road
as women and you know it anyway that
woman was perfectly right she turned over
to dodge a deep hole in the road she didnt
know you were going to pass because you
hadnt yet sounded your horn
  my word and tom glanced toward
alicia with an amused grin  at-a-
girl rally round to the defense of your
maligned sex
   but it makes me sick the way you men
persist in crabbing women who drive cars
i think they do mighty well especially when
so few of them can have a chance at a
car oftener than now and then-when
hubby doesnt happen to want it women
are just as good drivers as men lots of
them are better
   thats what you say her husband re-
torted and for the time being the discus-
sion died a natural death as their car swung
up to the willoughby home but alicia
was not through by any means
  after dinner that evening when the chil-
dren-ages two and four-were safely in
bed and tom had relaxed to the comfort
of a fragrant havana alicia opened up
on him again
   tom she began  i think its about
time i learned to run the car
   id rather you wouldnt he returned
shortly
   but tom dear please be reasonable
alicia learns to drive

all women drive nowadays you know
yourself that whenever theres an afternoon
bridge at the country club dozens of cars
are lined up and every one of them was
driven out by a woman
   women rarely become good drivers
he answered impatiently  and the few ex-
ceptions you are all ready to throw in my
face only prove the general rule they are
lacking in the mechanical instinct driving
an automobile involves a great deal more
than the simple matter of steering it an
intimate knowledge of the machine itself is
essential no person who fails to under-
stand for example the principle underlying
the shifting of gears on a hill can ever make
a crack driver
   i dont believe the majority of men
know that to most of them what goes
on beneath the hood of the car they drive
is a sealed book you happen to be an
exception and yet you seem to assume that
all men know as much about the automo-
biles vitals as you do
  tom willoughbys reply was a non-com-
mittal grunt
   listen tom and alicia perched her-
self on the arm of his chair  havent i
got brains
   of course tom admitted readily
   thank you so much well then this
is a sort of showdown if silly little flappers
like estelle simmons and dot fenton can
sport around in big cars and get away with
it  can whats more i intend to
   its not necessary at all tom argued
 i can usually find time to take you wher-
ever you want to go if not you can easily
order a taxi you know that
   you miss the point entirely i must
do it merely to show that i can if no other
reasons came into the argument plenty
others do for that matter its terribly
humiliating not to why ill soon be a
sort of laughing stock-the only woman in
my wide circle of acquaintance who is
forced to admit that she doesnt know how
to drive an automobile most of my friends
learned to drive practically as soon as their
husbands did some before
   women were never intended or designed
to drive cars tom insisted realizing as
he sooke the weakness of his assertion
   why tom willoughby youre al-
most mid-victorian in your ideas i never
thought it of you you belong back in the
dark ages when women were mere parlor
ornaments clinging vines and all that sort
of thing when no woman had any just
claim to beauty unless her waist was laced
in till it threatened to snap in two if she
had to bend over suddenly no golf ten-
nis swimming or driving cars for them
poor dears croquet was their limit in
physical exertion
   i never did admire fat waisted women
tom grinned provokingly
   i suppose you mean by that remark
that youd like me to begin pulling my
waist in no thank you women dont
do it now and they never will again
   no i dont mean that at all and tom
glanced approvingly at his wife-as slender
and youthful in appearance as the day they
were married  youre far from requiring
any such harsh measures but dont climb
up on any high horse regarding what women
will or will not do youll all do exactly
what your imperial goddess dame fashion
demands of her loyal subjects now the
streamline effect is in vogue but when in
the course of events the cycle swings round
again and small waists are called for youll
find the poor helpless women obediently
pulling in on the strings until their fingers
are blistered
   tom willoughby youre positively dis-
gusting alicia flared but tom only
chuckled in exasperating good nature
  his wife deserted him and withdrew to a
chair in another part of the room with an
air of injured dignity presently she spoke
up again
   im going to learn to drive the car just
the same
  all right all right tom exclaimed
resignedly  if you say you will you will
so we may as well consider it settled im
not crazy about the business but ill give
you a lesson in the morning
   but i dont want you to teach me tom
have a man sent up from the service sta-
tion
   whats the matter with me cant i
drive well enough
  youre too good tom-so skilled a

argosy-allstory weekly
driver yourself that youd have no patience
with my shortcomings all the women say
that you must never never let your hus-
band teach you to drive while youre en-
gaged to him or about the time he wants
you to become engaged to him is the best
time after marriage never husbands jaw
you and bawl you out unmercifully so one
must get a stranger he has to be polite
and gentle with his pupil no matter what
she does
   by jove alicia if you havent got it
all doped out and tom laughed in spite
of himself  but heres where your gears
dont mesh im willing to make a conces-
sion and let you learn to drive the car but
im not going to have any half baked young
salesman from the agency sit back and
smile serenely while you in your blessed ig-
norance ruin the sweetest running motor in
the city ill promise to try to behave like
a gentleman and not yell at you unduly
but if you take lessons in driving its got
to be with your husband as teacher im
sorry hon but thats the best i can do for
you
  alicia hesitated an instant then grace-
fully yielded to what she instinctively real-
ized was the inevitable
   all right she agreed  but lets make
a game out of it lets pretend that youre
not teaching your wife at all just imagine
that your pupil is that snappy looking little
mrs armstrong of whom you spoke so
warmly the other day
   whats the big idea tom demanded
eying alicia a bit uneasily
   why if you were teaching mrs arm-
strong to drive your car stupid and she
pulled back on a lever instead of pushing
forward or made that mysterious thingum-
bob under the floor boards chatter like a
mowing machine youd say  never mind
thats really nothing at all youre doing
splendidly thats what youd say tom
and down in your precious old heart you
know it on the other hand if your poor
wife made a frightful mess of things im
very much afraid youd swear-not at her
of course but swear in a general sort of
way and im pretty sure youd inquire
loud enough to frighten some horses a quar-
ter of a mile away  what in the world are
you trying to do-wreck the boat and
so thats why id like to impersonate mrs
armstrong during the lesson if you dont
mind
  tom sat back and laughed till the tears
came
    you win the flat tire alicia he cried
 dont worry ill be good
   you better had tom willoughby
alicia declared then she added darkly
 remember that if you yell at me im
going to be awfully mad
   fair enough old girl tom laughed
 since youve warned me now if youre
going to drive we might as well go about this
right youve got to get at least a general
knowledge of the principles involved i
think i can make it reasonably clear
alicia listened dutifully at first that is
but she skidded rather badly on the second
curve and then her brain a confused jum-
ble of meaningless terms-carburetor pis-
ton compression stroke cam shaft and so
on-she wisely reflected that none of the
girls who drove cars knew anything about
that formidable list and managed to get by
on the road in spite of such ignorance so
why worry instead she began dreaming
about how much fun it was going to be
when she was free to use the car without
having to call on tom to drive her around
suddenly the instructor ceased his lecture
with a brisk
   understand so far whereupon alicia
dimpled sweetly at him and confessed with
praiseworthy candor
   not all im afraid
  to her relief tom took it as a good joke
 im crazy to think of jamming all this
into your head at once hon what you
need you can pick up as you go along to-
morrow morning well have the first lesson
tom was really very gentle and patient
with alicia she admitted that herself in-
deed he was quite puffed up with pride over
his forbearance with her slips as a mat-
ter of fact however she managed quite
well-for the initial attempt
   did i do so terribly bad tommy
she inquired when they returned home
   no-o tom answered judicially  but
when you stop the car remember not to
let in the clutch until the gears are in neu-
alicia learns to drive

tral you stalled the engine that way sev-
eral times even after id cautioned you
   neutrals when the levers in the middle
of the h isnt it she asked and when
tom nodded alicia began repeating to her-
self over and over  dont let in clutch un-
less gears are in neutral though not having
the slightest idea as to the whys and where-
fores
  a few days later tom gave her practice
in gear shifting on a hill and poor alicia
didnt do quite so well actually the en-
gine came in for quite a bit of abuse
though its driver was blissfully unconscious
of this finally she plugged up a long
hill barely crawling around a dangerous
curve in high gear alicia had dreaded that
place and getting by it at all was to her
very much of a victory
  there she breathed in triumphant
elation  wasnt that fine
   no groaned tom who had held him-
self in so far only by herculean efforts  it
was rotten
  quickly she pulled off to one side of the
road and stopped in her hurt bewilderment
at this wholly unexpected condemnation in-
stead of the hearty praise she had hoped
for alicia let the clutch pedal back while
the engine was still running the gears in
high the car gave a little jump forward
and then the engine stalled
    im sorry faltered alicia realizing the
mistake too late to remedy it  but when
you get that dying-duck-in-a-thunderstorm
look on your face im gone thats all
now what in the world did i do wrong com-
ing up that hill
   everything said tom shortly  you
were moving too slowly for high and the
poor old engine was knocking its head off
you should have dropped into second or
cured the knock by pulling down the spark
lever i explained that to you very care-
fully yesterday
   but there are so many things to remem-
ber tommy alicia cried miserably  you
ought not to expect me to get them all at
once desperately she struggled against
giving way to the tears which were perilous-
ly near the surface  i got up the old
hill didnt i what difference does it
make how i got up
    gad alicia but that s a terrible line of
argument tom fumed beginning to lose
his temper  what would you think of a
surgeon who bungled in an important opera-
tion and then excused it with the careless
remark  well what difference does it make
as long as the patient refused to die of
course you got up the hill but a few more
successes like that and our car will be ready
for the junkman i dont believe youll ever
learn to drive
  alicia her lips quivering slipped out
from behind the wheel
   go ahead and drive yourself she de-
clared  im through all the girls said
it was always this way when your husband
taught you and thats the f-first t-time
you ever jawed at me
   but i didnt really jaw you dear tom
said gently already ashamed of his mo-
mentary temper  i didnt say anything so
very rough did i
   you said my driving was r-rotten when
i thought id done so well and you couldnt
have looked any blacker if id run the old
car through a stone wall
   im sorry dear but you ought to know
by this time that any unnecessary abuse of
a fine motor makes me actually sick to
me an automobile is like a living thing
   that sounds very well alicia rejoined
in stony dignity  but your wife surely is
entitled to as much consideration as any
automobile you shouldnt think more of a
collection of senseless steel parts than of
her feelings since you do i suppose id
better give up my idea of driving i can
see what it will lead to
   come now alicia please be reasonable
i was rude and i apologize start the motor
and try it again
   do you really want me to you
havent been displaying any alarming symp-
toms of enthusiasm
   well as long as your heart is set on
driving i want you to keep at it please
alicia
  so alicia tried it again but she was ner-
vous and tom was also nervous though h
made a manful effort to conceal his condi-
tion which was so pitiable that alicia was
actually sorry for him she managed to get
them home without wrecking the car

argosy-allstory weekly
  in the lessons which followed she made
less rapid progress than at the beginning for
tom was very exacting as to the finer points
of driving alicia was more than once close
to utter discouragement
   i must say youre hard to suit she ex-
claimed one day  honestly i dont be-
lieve its humanly possible to please you
no matter what i might do youd find
something to criticize
   im trying my darnedest in what looks
like the hopeless job of making a good driv-
er of you he snapped back  theres
one thing you certainly are good at thats
forgetting instructions if youd only do
as youve been told thered be no criticisms
forthcoming what i cant seem to get you
away from is the footless and silly notion
that any old way is good enough provided
it gets you there
  tom and alicia were really an ideal cou-
ple held up as the perfect model of wedded
happiness by all their friends the only
times they ever even approached a quarrel
was over the car and those occasions left
both of them miserable
  alicia was slow in gaining that self-confi-
dence which is so essential to the full mas-
tery of a heavy automobile this w-as main-
ly toms fault for perhaps unconsciously
his very attitude served to destroy her con-
fidence to unnerve her the best drivers
do not always make the best instructors
  came a saturday when they had been in-
vited for dinner and an evening of bridge
with friends-a young married couple living
about twenty miles away the weather was
threatening when they started and as a
measure of precaution tom fitted the tour-
ing car with its side curtains the sky
grew blacker but no rain materialized dur-
ing the trip and the storm did not finally
break until just as dinner was served then
it more than made up for the delay-an
electrical disturbance of unusual severity
accompanied by a veritable cloudburst
which continued fully two hours without
intermission
  the storm put an effective damper on
the social pleasures of the evening as both
alicia and her hostess were terrified by the
vivid lightning and tom himself was secret-
ly concerned as to road conditions for the
homeward drive the rain finally slack-
ened and tom announced that he thought
they ought to start back
   dont think of going home to-night old
man cried the host  weve a spare bed-
room that isnt earning its keep better stay
over with us
   indeed yes his wife urged hospitably
 it would be foolish to go home now
   but mothers staying with the chil-
dren alicia protested  and if we dont
appear at all shell be frantic
   ill phone your mother not to expect
you till to-morrow but her attempt to get
the central operator was fruitless the
line was dead
   storms put the wires out of commis-
sion tom willoughby remarked
 what  we do alicia go or stay
its up to you
   well have to go alicia declared
without an instants hesitation and no urg-
ing on the part of their friends could change
her decision
  it was about ten when they set out the
rain decreased to a fine steady drizzle
though the thunderstorm had passed by
two miles from the starting point the road
crossed a small river where their machine
was halted by a red lantern in the hands
of a guard
   cant cross this bridge he warned
them  its liable to go plumb to kingdom
come any minute
  tom got out to look the situation over
the ordinarily modest little river was now
a foaming roaring torrent showing brown
with its load of sediment in the glare of the
head lamps even as he watched one of
the bridge supports yielded to the relent-
less thrust of the flood
   that bridge is scheduled to take a long
ride i reckon was the guards cool com-
ment
   right you are tom agreed grimly
 but how can i get across
   the iron bridge three miles down the
river at haskinss mills was o k the last
report i got but you better shake a leg
for the way the waters still rising even that
one wont last
  the low mutter of thunder sounded while
he was speaking
alicia learns to drive

   another storm like the last one and
well not have a live bridge left in the
county the guard continued  those
birds travel in pairs sometimes mebby
its twin brother is coming along now if
it is-good night you familiar with the
detour down to haskinss mills
   never drove it tom told him
  the guard gave detailed instructions as
to the road to the bridge then added
   when you once get across the river
youre all right keep straight ahead for
four-five miles through the woods and it 
bring you back to the state road here again
youll find the traveling not too easy but
it can be done some bad hills watch
your step on em
   much obliged said tom  have a
cigar
  thanks returned the guard appre-
ciatively good luck
  tom briefly explained the situation to
alicia
   nothing to be worried over he re-
marked as he turned around-a difficult
operation because of the ditches full of
water on either side of the hard roadbed
  she snuggled comfortably up against him
as they headed back for the detour
   im glad im not driving now arent
you tommy she whispered then star-
tled  what was that as a brilliant flash
illumined the sky
   more lightning looks like another
storm coming
   what ever shall we do you know
how deathly afraid of thunderstorms i
am
   do he echoed  why nothing but
hit that bridge at the mills and then
straight ahead through the woods till were
on the state road again next stop home
dont let yourself get worked up hon
really theres no occasion to be frightened
 but suppose its a storm like that first
one
   dont worry we wont get another
like that for ten years
   i hope not and alicia shivered slight-
ly nestling closer against her husband
  the second thunderstorm developed far
more rapidly than its predecessor but tom
drove fast-almost dangerously fast for the
muddy road they traveled-and pulled up
at the iron bridge just as the first big drops
were falling lightning was almost con-
tinuous though still some little distance
away there was a guard on duty at this
bridge as at the other
   is it safe tom inquired anxiously
   shes safe enough now mister he was
informed  but i aint predictin what shell
be before morning listen to that barrage
old lady natures laying down back there
  tom didnt wait to discuss the matter
he shot across the bridge and on up into
the woods where he immediately found
any sort of speed wholly out of the ques-
tion then storm number two broke upon
them in earnest proving tom a poor
weather prophet as regarded his ten years
remark alicia clutched his arm in terror
at the continuous crackle of thunder and
the dazzle of lightning
  suddenly a huge dead chestnut just
ahead loomed up for the fraction of a sec-
ond clear-cut in the blinding unnatural
glare with a roar like that of a thousand
cannon it actually exploded heavy frag-
ments of the trunk and branches flying in
all directions alicia screamed frantically
as another lightning flash disclosed a por-
tion of the shattered tree toppling toward
them to avoid it in its fall was out of
the question dimly she realized that tom
had thrust her down from the seat his own
body bent over hers as protection a crash-
ing splintering blow-and silence
  not many minutes later a trickle of
water flowing through the ruined top of the
car on alicias face brought her back to
consciousness she had not been hurt at
all had fainted from sheer fright more
than anything else a crushing weight
pinned her down and a sickening realiza-
tion of what had happened swept into her
brain the weight was tom possibly
killed at the best badly hurt by a piece of
the old chestnut when the lightning bolt hit
it and his last conscious thought and act
had been of her-an attempt to save her
from the very danger which struck him
down
  desperately hot tears flooding her eyes
alicia struggled to free herself toms poor
helpless body pressed down so heavily-

argosy-allstory weekly
panic gripped her at its apparent utter life-
lessness she managed to reach up and
turn the latch of the door which opened
an inch and then stuck bracing her feet
as best she could in such cramped quarters
alicia pushed backward against the jammed
door abruptly it yielded and she
sprawled out into the mud and pelting rain
quickly she regained her feet intent only
on learning the extent of toms injuries
  the car lights were still burning but
they gave her no help however there was
a flash light in the side pocket of the door
and alicia had it out in a second
  the scene it disclosed was startling
enough a long splinter of the chestnut
like a giant rail had fallen directly across
the top of the car crushing tom down be-
neath but how badly was he hurt that
was the vital question now
  in feverish haste she tugged at his limp
body and after an effort succeeded in get-
ting it free from the jumble of torn mohair
and crumpled bows of the top fortunately
the section of chestnut tree cause of all
their trouble had broken in half across the
car as a result of its fall and now played
no part in holding toms body prisoner
 tom dear speak to me alicia
moaned her fingers smoothing back the
hair on his forehead
  there was no response and in a sudden
spasm of shuddering horror alicia felt sure
that he was dead she tore open his coat
and shirt placing her ear directly above
the heart the steady throb characteristic
of a healthy athletic man like tom wil-
loughby was not there but straining her
ear to catch the faintest sound above the
rattle of raindrops on the ruined top alicia
did get something a flicker perhaps even
more than that not much yet enough at
least to assure her that tom was still liv-
ing
  tom darling dont leave me she
whispered softly  you mustnt leave me
now then turning her face upward into
the stinging rain she sobbed  oh god
dont let him die he just cant die
  a thin stream of blood trickled down
out of toms rain-sodden hair and alicia
seeking its source found an ugly bruise on
the top of his skull tenderly she fingered
the wound immediately realizing that it
was serious she feared a fracture perhaps
concussion of the brain prompt and ex-
pert medical attention might save him
otherwise - alicia shuddered at the
thought but to mention doctors-at such
a time and place-marooned there in the
depths of that desolate wood on a lonely
road a dreadful storm raging it all seemed
a hopeless mockery
  a sharp flash of forked lightning with
its nerve - shattering accompaniment
brought no more than a slight start from
alicia suddenly she seemed to have lost
her former fear of lightning in the har-
rowing crisis which she now faced all other
things seemed indeed trivial what could
she do
   im going to drive tom home in this
car she abruptly announced aloud ad-
dressing the raging elements  stop me
if you can
  with a degrefe of forced calm alicia sur-
veyed the machine by aid of occasional
lightning flashes and her small electric
lamp the tangled mohair and splintered
bows formed a blockade behind the steer-
ing wheel but she found a knife in toms
pocket and succeeded in cutting away the
worst of the mess the section of chestnut
worried her but owing to the lucky fact
that it had broken alicia shrewdly reasoned
that if she once got the car started it would
clear itself of that encumbrance
  she settled tom in the seat next the
drivers the posture was far from a com-
fortable one but with a tender little smile
which reflected no pleasure and a world of
pain she remembered that tom was past
caring about bodily comforts or discom-
forts then climbing awkwardly around
the obstructions that still blocked the
wheel alicia pressed the starter
  slowly engine racing and wheels churn-
ing mud the car moved ahead with a sharp
cracking from the shattered chestnut for
an instant progress ceased and despair en-
gulfed alicia at the thought that she was
trapped then the spinning wheels found
traction and the car leaped forward free
from the dragging fragments of the splin-
tered tree
  the rain increased to a deluge fairly
alicia learns to drive

blotting out the gleam from the head lamps
the windshield supports were badly bent
though by some strange freak of chance
neither of the plate glass sections had been
broken the blur of water made the glass
opaque she could see nothing through it
alicia struggled with the windshield final-
ly succeeded in opening it she had been
wet before but now in an instant she was
soaked the filmy evening gown worn in
honor of the little dinner party molded to
her like so much adhesive plaster she
could see a little better however which
was the only important consideration
  that backwoods road was none too good
under the most favorable circumstances
now it was a nightmare-mud rocks and
water-filled holes into which the rear wheels
dropped to the hubs with a sickening lurch
of the car there to spin furiously with the
racing engine until at last they gripped
the slimy roadbed and again drove the ma-
chine forward rapid progress was im-
possible even had alicia dared attempt it
most of the time she was forced to keep in
second on that unspeakable road the big
car bucked and bounced like a flivver
holding it down taxed alicias strength to
the utmost
  a stretch of hard gravel roused false
hopes that the worst was over and for the
first time alicia ventured to make fair
speed conscious only of the fact that toms
life might hang on a few seconds the
gravel ended as unexpectedly as it had be-
gun and at a sharp curve in the road
when her wheels hit the soft mud alicia
skidded and before she realized what had
happened the left rear wheel was bedded
deep in the ooze off to one side the car
headed diagonally across the road
  alicia made one fruitless attempt to go
forward then tried with no more success
to back she had ridden enough with tom
to learn the danger of letting the wheel
churn deeper and deeper in such a situa-
tion desperately struggling against an in-
clination to give way to panic she got out
of the car to investigate the wheel was
mired less deeply than she had feared
though it was bad enough
  the headlights disclosed a pile of tan-
gled tree tops and branches left where
some one had been cutting firewood to-
ward this alicia stumbled sinking nearly
to her knees in mud and water a clump
of blackberry briers tearing viciously at her
legs to which the gauzy dress she wore af-
forded no protection whatever
  several trips she made thrusting the
dead branches down in front and back of
the tire half dead alicia crawled back
into the car not till then realizing that one
of her slippers was gone the dash light
showed a long tear in one of her black silk
stockings the skin beneath white in con-
trast the white rapidly changing to red
yet alicia had felt no pain there was a
growing numbness over her whole body
it seemed that utter collapse could not be
far away she grimly set her teeth deter-
mined not to yield
  she remembered that tom had told her
the clutch must be eased in very gently
when a wheel was mired she tried this
the gear shift lever in reverse to her de-
light the car responded backing perhaps a
foot again she left her seat to thrust more
of the dead branches deep into the mud
where the wheel had been back in the
car she slipped the lever into low hardly
daring to breathe as she gently nursed the
clutch feeding only a little gas to the en-
gine striving to the best of her ability to
avoid that fatal spinning of the trapped
wheel
  she felt the motor slow down as the
clutch took hold alicia gave a trifle more
gas and she wanted to shout in relief as
the car moved slowly forward she cut the
wheel sharply then straightened out and
was again on her way
  the slow progress made that lonely road
through the woods seem endless suddenly
alicia woke up to the alarming fact that
the engine was no longer responding prop-
erly to the throttle was losing its snap and
power it even knocked distressfully when
she tried to push up a slight grade in sec-
ond she shut off the ignition and could
hear the water boiling furiously in the cool-
ing jackets
  sick and dizzy hardly knowing what she
was about alicia got the folding bucket
from under the rear seat dipping it full
from a roadside puddle there was certain-

argosy-allstory weekly
ly no lack of water available but when
she heedlessly proceeded to unscrew the
radiator cap a spurt of steam shot out into
the air scalding her hand and fingers she
didnt feel the pain till later
  it took four pails of water to replenish
the exhausted supply in the cooling system
and again alicia crawled weakly in behind
the steering wheel she felt that to get out
of the machine once more would be utterly
beyond her failing strength
  the second thunder storm had passed on
after the first and now a cold rain fell with
steady relentlessness a long winding hill
loomed up before her half delirious she
babbled to the engine
   please oh please take us up this hill
dont desert me now  and almost reckless-
ly alicias slipperless toes pushed down on
the accelerator for a good start up she
raced in second but the grade and mud
were too much for the overheated motor
it faltered knocking alicia attempted to
get into low a change she had never yet
had occasion to mrke on a hill the gears
clashed horribly and before she could start
up again the car came to a stop-started
backing down in desperation she opened
the throttle wide slamming home the
clutch the entire transmission groaned a
bitter protest at such unfair treatment but
everything held and the machine with a
violent jerk resumed progress up the hill
at last it gained the summit far below
lights were visible in the falling rain they
marked the state road
  alicia was too far gone to appreciate the
dangers and difficulties which beset her on
all sides as the car had slid down that
grade under other circumstances in day-
light she would no more have undertaken
the task than attempt to drive an airplane
  on the state road at last alicias brain
refused to work clearly dimly she remem-
bered that tom must be taken to a doctor
but like a wounded pigeon her thoughts
centered only on home and toward home
she sped
  in the meantime her mother was nearly
dead from worry a phone message had
finally come through telling her that tom
and alicia had started at ten an hour
usually sufficed for the trip and when one
oclock arrived with no other news from
the wanderers the poor woman was con-
vinced that her fears of some disaster could
not be groundless she sat up waiting un-
able to go to bed dreading the worst
  it was after two when she heard the
sound of a motor at the driveway she
rushed to the door but there was no an-
swer to her relieved cry of welcome the
porch light shone on a forlorn looking car
at first she could not recognize it as toms
machine it looked like a wrecked ship
the top crumpled in nothing visible but
mud and two unconscious figures in the
front seat alicia slumping forward across
the steering wheel the last half of that
frightful journey she had driven on sheer
nerve but there is a limit even to that she
lasted just long enough to swing the car into
the driveway at home
  in a couple of days alicia was herself
again save for a few minor aches and pains
that still persisted but tom got by much
less easily in fact he pulled through by
a very narrow margin finally they let her
see him
   that was a wonderful thing you did
alicia he said huskily as she dropped on
her knees beside the bed her fingers ten-
derly stroking his bandaged head  do
you know what the surgeon told me
  alicia said nothing her head pillowed on
toms broad chest
   he said tom continued fussing with
alicias hair  that if you hadnt got me
home when you did it would have been the
end of the trail for me youre a wonder-
ful girl alicia not one woman in a thou-
sand could have brought the car in over
that awful road youre a driver now
alicia ill never criticize you again
   but i didnt do at all well tom dear
alicia humbly confessed her voice muffled
by the bedclothes  i got the poor old
engine terribly hot and it knocked and i
nearly stripped the gears and everything
really i gave a miserable exhibition of
driving
   what of it hon tom demanded
 your getting through at all proved that
youre a real driver the accomplishment
was the important thing how you did it
doesnt make a particle of difference

a strange turn
there are some who are stunned by
danger there are others who strike
back hard an action of swift and un-
reasoned reflexes
  and though olivetta bad led a most shel-
tered life yet now she reverted to the type
of what she might have been in the wild
and the rough she was backed against
the wall the loss of the pearls being dis-
covered she could expect to be quickly
found and dragged from her hiding place
and she estimated her strength and the
distances to be covered and all the things
to be done if she bolted for the window
or what seemed now a far better chance
if she struck straight for the doorway and
strove to speed down the hall beyond and
down the stairs to the bottom of the house
with a prayer of hope that once she was
at the bottom she would find a door open
and thence gain access to the street
  yet al this was a hopeless planning in
two bounds no matter how by surprise she
took him john hodge would be up with
her or if he could not overtake her by
running or if he wished to cut short the
thrilling screams which she would begin
the instant she started in her break for
safet- he would knock her down with a
bullet
  she knew him well enough to know that
she felt
  all those hopes doubts fears plans had
been condensed and crammed into the space
of a meager second while the girl leaned
over the table drawer her face working
then she turned upon john hodge
   after all she said in a low voice  it
was only a glorious bluff 
 a
thit tory began in the argosy - allstory weekly for november 


argosy-allstory weekly
   eh said hodge evidently at sea
 ive bluffed now and then i suppose and
here and there but what are you referring
to now
  she gestured disdainfully to the drawer
and stepped away john hodge came to
the place in one long stride and stared down
olivetta pushing to the side the clothes
which were hanging about her prepared for
her desperate bolt drew in her breath to
be in readiness for the first shriek on which
she must depend to draw vengeance upon
the heads of her enemies and crouched a
little lower but john hodge had neither
exclaimed nor moved he merely looked
down to the drawer in silence for a mo-
ment and then lifted a face which was only
a trifle paler perhaps
   oh he said  you mean the pearls
 what else said the girl  it really
excited me your willingness to leave them
in my care but i see that it was only
for effect john hodge-simply because you
thought that that would be a good way to
blind me ah youre a very clever fellow
john but youve given me just one too
many opportunities to see through you
olivetta amazed studied him and for
once he had no ready answer what could
possess him thought olivetta
   wasnt that a natural thing for me to
do he said  particularly in the light
of what you said about your father good
gad jacqueline you couldnt expect me to
leave that large fortune around loose after
you had warned me about him could you
 there is no reason why you should
hunt for explanations john she said
 they are your pearls you can do what
you wish with them
   nonsense jack he pleaded  good
gad dont be silly about this
   im not she said  im perfectly seri-
ous perfectly calm
  she laughed to prove it her laughter
was crystal hard it was plain that she
was angered to the core of her heart
   jack he said  id give you one of
the pearls if it would buy this anger
  he had made a miscue
  bah she cried at him do you
think it makes any difference to me whether
or no you trust me only-let us be frank
with one another for gods sake let us
be frank my dear john you think i am
a thief the daughter of a thief i think
as much of you you think i am-amus-
ing and i think that you are-only a little
too thick with your acting john-only a
little too thick
  the last words were spoken through
clenched teeth she was under the govern-
ance of the wildest passion
   jacqueline-
  she was in such a rage that his yielding
manner threw oil on her fire
   will you leave me to be quiet in my
room she said  and stop annoying me
 if only- he began
   i dont want to talk cried jacqueline
   you have to listen to me jack 
   not a word if you will not leave me
in peace then i shall leave you do you
understand
   jacqueline when you are quieter-
   why if you insist upon keeping the
room i shall go to another place and-
she changed her mind about completing
the sentence which she had started and
flew out of the room crashing the door close
behind her and before the rapid tattoo of
her feet had died away down the hall john
hodge turned and walked straight to the
closet of olivetta
  she was prepared only the closing of
the door into the hall had cut down to the
point of zero her chances of escape yet
when he opened the closet jerking wide
the door she sprang out like a little tigress
her lips parted for the scream
  but the sound was stillborn if there
had lingered in her any doubt about his pos-
sible gentility it was now banished an
iron-hard right hand darted out and the
palm was clapped across her mouth with
such force that she was half stunned
  she found herself jerked back into his
arms and half crushed by the force with
which he held her
  you infernal spoil sport gasped john
hodge at her ear  you confounded nui-
sance if you so much as whisper do you
know what will happen youll have your
throat cut from ear to ear you hear
and theyll cut mine too
  he threw her away from him she stag-
the stranger at the gate

gered back against the wall gaping and
staring at him her mind was refusing to
work toward the meaning of his words
   give me the pearls
  she could not resist she was hypnotized
with terror and the nearness of him she
poured into his long extended hand the
stream of great pearls and he dumped
them without a glance into his pocket
   now can you come with me
  she did not answer there were no words
which she could find to answer with
   it means very simply he said  that
if they find you in this house theyll mur-
der you my dear and think no more about
it is that perfectly clear
  she managed to nod
   get that frozen look off your face he
said  youve got to think faster now
than you ever did before and youve got
to keep yourself under control as you never
did before the reason is that two lives
hang on what you do if youre caught here
theyll blame your coming on me and
theyll get rid of the two of us
   if theres only her father here- be-
gan the girl
   they have a half dozen cutthroats in
hand my dear and theyd think nothing
of sending them to get us and whittle the
two of us into small bits to be sown on the
river waters is that plain
   then lock the door and start making
a noise that will bring help
   do you think i want help brought
do you think that fm mad
  she shrank from him and he actually
smiled at her so perfect was his self-control
so deadly cold was his courage in the crisis
   follow me he said  step as i step
they mustnt hear two people walking
  she nodded and he turned his back on
her and led the way our of the room walk-
ing with short quick steps to which she
kept time softly behind him he led down
a dark hall which smelled of the dust of
long vacancy long lack of human care
and opening another door he showed her
into a room where he switched on the light
and revealed a great bare apartment with
only a cot in one corner a bureau in an-
other and nothing upon floor or walls ex-
cept a single cracked mirror there were
one or two ancient chairs and there were
two closets whose open doors revealed in-
teriors where only half a dozen garments
hung a suit case had been dropped in a
corner and the dust was already whitening
on top of it
   here we are said john hodge clos-
ing the door behind them
  she turned about and faced him again
it was strange above all strange things that
she should be trusting to him for guidance
or protection and now that she was closet-
ed with him in this room it seemed to her
that she would faint from sheer dread
   sit down he commanded
  she obeyed
   now get that look out of your eyes
ill promise you one thing that fm not go-
ing to dispose of you immediately if thats
whats on your mind i havent brought you
in here to murder you my dear
  in spite of the peril which it seemed
threatened him also he was daring to laugh
in his grim way she gaped at him
   thats better he said  anything is
better than that frozen face turn your
head a little
  she obeyed it seemed that she had no
volition saving what he poured into her from
his overpowering strength
   by jove he murmured  i hurt you
when i crashed my hand over your mouth
i was too rough but i hadnt the time to be
polite one yell from you would have sent
us both to hell excuse the word wont
you wipe that bit of blood away
  without a word studying his face as
though the strength to raise her hand came
from his scowl she lifted the handkerchief
and under the touch found that her lip was
a trifle sore and wiped away a fleck of
blood john hodge had leaned his wide
shoulders against the wall and was scowling
down at the floor thoughtfully
chapter xxiii
lvetta changes sides
at length he shrugged his shoulders and
w looked suddenly up as one who aban-
dons thought finding it useless for
the moment  we may talk freely enough

argosy-allstory weekly
for a moment or two he said  shes
downstairs telling her father about the
pearls-just to get it out of her system and
to put me in as much danger as possible
after that shell probably be a bit sorry
for a moment or two and shell come back
to tell me what shes done and how sorry
she is some girls are that way theyre
full of impulse they act on impulse enough
to damn every one around them and then
theyre as sorry as can be
  he grinned at her entirely without mirth
 in the first place he said  you
recognized me when you saw me on the
train
  she nodded then shook her head
   no he insisted
   i-i-i only thought there was-some-
thing-
   i tell you upon my word of honor
said john hodge  that if there is any
possibility of harm coming to you in this
house it will not come from me will that
help you to talk more freely
  she could not help but believe liar and
murderer and thief though she knew him
to be yet she found herself incredible
though it seemed honoring and trusting him
as a harbor of refuge
 in the first place he went on smiling
on her again  you must admit that i have
made you famous you wont deny that
she was beginning to find it possible to
think her blood again circulated
   i put forward that claim to make you
a bit more at ease he said  does it
 john hodge she breathed suddenly
 whatever you may have been in the past
i know that you are now the only thing i
can look toward for help in this crisis i
believe that you have told me the truth
and that there is a mortal peril for me
and-lets not talk about things that have
gone before-lets only plan how we can
best fight our way out
  he nodded to her stroking his long hard
chin in his thoughtful way
   you are certainly a trojan he said
in the same mild and self-possessed fashion
 but at the present moment there is not
an earthly thing we can do we might go
back to the fire escape upon which i take
it you came to the room of jacqueline but
wed never reach the bottom of the stairs
never so we might as well rest here and
wait for developments can you stand the
suspense
  she swallowed hard and nodded  ill
try she said faintly
   and now go back to what happened
on the train you followed your idea-that
ghost of a thought that you knew me you
got off the subway in the same crowd with
me at one hundred and twenty-eighth
street and trailed me into a taxicab
  she nodded again to her amazement
instead of betraying vexation he merely
rubbed his long bony hands together and
chuckled down at her so great was his
apparent enjoyment that he started to walk
up and down the room still nodding and
chuckling and as he strode to and fro
turning swiftly at the ends of his walk he
seemed to her more like a panther than
ever
   and by the eternal he went on stop-
ping suddenly and facing her with his legs
spread far apart- by the eternal you
noted the house i went into and came
around to try the back entrance good
gad-its almost more than i can believe
though i have the evidence of my own eyes
with nerve like that for a girl if you were
a man thered be no stopping you there
would be absolutely no stopping you but
tell me were you much frightened
  he had drawrn a chair close to hers and
facing her now he sank into it and leaned
forward bringing his face very near she
could see that he was as excited as he was
delighted and more and more he amazed
her until at last it seemed to her that he
must have given the right explanation after
all when he confessed to jacqueline that he
lived for the joy of danger
   yes she admitted  i was nearly
dead with fear
   but you kept on
   yes
   what nerved you what kept you
going
  she managed to meet his eye but she
could not help flushing
   oh he said  you can talk right from
the shoulder i know that you understand
all of my vices and crimes and it was
the stranger at the gate

the thought of all that i had done that
spurred you on eh i had done murder
robbery in your house where you took me in
as a guest and i had wound up the deal
by attacking your father with mysterious
intent
  he broke into a soundless chuckling once
more but stopped this to continue  it
was that which kept you going when you
were about to sink with fear by the lord
i admire you with all my soul
  he stopped short
   did you hear much of our talk-jac-
quelines and mine
   from the time vou came into the room
yes
   you were there that long
  he snapped his fingers in his vexation
 but let it go it cant be helped as a
matter of fact the one thing thats kept
my skin whole in this house has been the
interest that jacqueline takes in me do you
understand
    yes said olivetta faintly
  his embarrassment grew he cleared his
throat he looked down to the floor
   let me try to explain more in detail
he went on  you know that recently it
has been necessary for me to lead a rather
secluded life to put it mildly
    yes said olivetta
  and through her mind swept some im-
ages from the crowded mass of headlines
and advertisements which had to do with
the chase of john hodge and the rewards
offered for his apprehension yes there
were certainly reasons why he must keep
in seclusion
   so that as a matter of fact said john
hodge  if i should cut loose from this
one last harbor which remains to me i
should be running my head into the noose
the chances would be about five to one
against me i might fool the people for a
time with disguises of one sort or another
but in the end some one would be very apt
to run me to the earth just as you have
done though by heaven i think that
there are fewer brains in the list of men
ive known than there are in the detective
brain of miss dascom but you follow my
drift-it is life for me in this house or
death outside of it
   yes yes but-
    you are going to tell me he smiled at
her  that youre sorry you ran me to the
ground tut tut im a sufficiently good
sportsman to give you all the credit due for
the excellent game you have played and
the way you have played it but to come
around to the main thing im trying to ex-
plain jacqueline is a charming girl-in
ways but her father is an abysmal brute
the one thing that has kept his cudgel from
my sconce has been jacqueline and the
instant that jacqueline loses interest in me
im a goner and she will lose interest i
fear the instant she discovers that there is a
girl in this room does it begin to clear up
the situation for you
   yes i begin to see but surely she
knows-
   that you have been trailing me in the
name of the law it will be hard for her
to understand that if she finds that i am
protecting you-you see in short jac-
queline has to think that im prodigiously
fond of her-
   he paused quite red in the face
    i think said olivetta  that that is
a part you can quite easily play
   ah yes answered john hodge in an
oddly submissive way  i suppose you feel
that you have a right to say that some
time-but let it go again i cant hope to
explain its all too much of a confounded
muddle just now it bewilders even me at
times only-if the pinch should come and
i should have to talk to jacqueline as
though i were devilishly fond of her-
    i shall understand said olivetta and
she flushed in turn
   there is one thing more i am going to
tell you though i cant expect that you
will either understand or believe and it is
this i did not kill sam logan i did not
attack your father to do him any physical
injury no matter what he may say and
thirdly the sheik i can be said to have
stolen for a sufficient reason-that it be-
longs to me 
  so saying he turned his back squarely
upon her and walked to the window
there was an interval during which she
stared at his wide shoulders tapering down
to the lean narrow hips

argosy-allstory weekly
  he whirled upon her
   it seems impossible to you he de-
manded
  she did not answer
   very well but just keep a shadow of
doubt in your mind until the time comes
when i can try to explain as for nearly
everything i have told you i freely admit
that they were lies all that stuff about the
red captain and old hallyt being the same
was of course just bunk but these three
things are true ill try to prove em later
on just now i think ill have my hands
full with quite another problem
  he raised a bony forefinger as he spoke
a heavy footfall was creaking up the
stairs and now it beat out squeaks and
groans from the flooring of the upper hall
   thats her father said john hodge
and it seemed to olivetta that he lost color
a little as he spoke  its not an easy job
to persuade him of anything except what he
wants to believe im going to ask you to
go into that closet and wait there quietly
no matter what he does dont be too fright-
ened- sometimes his words are a bit worse
than his actions-though often his thunder
and lightning go together
  as he spoke he had opened a door to the
closet and was waving her toward it she
paused an instant as she was stepping in
   not for my sake only but for your
sake too she said  oh john hodge i
wish you another victory
  and so she stepped on into the solid
blackness of the closet and the last that
she saw of his face was a look of blank
wonder shot through with joy
chapter xxiv
before the storm
a ponderous blow crashed against
the door of the room olivetta
huddled into the black corner of the
closet craned her head into the white wedge
of light that struck in-for the door was
left a trifle ajar but she could only see
john hodge turn toward the sound
  hello hodge called a thick deep
voice from the interior of the hall
   hello said hodge  come in tom
  the door was thrown open with a bang
and closed with equal violence a wheezing
man whose immense bulk she could sense
by the quiver of the floor beneath his tread
made a step or two into the interior of the
room
   this said tom  is a hell of a hole
come down below hodge and get into a
comfortable chair i got a few things to
say to you
   why not here said hodge  be-
sides im about to turn in fire away
governor and you can shoot as straight
here as you can below
  tom grunted in response grumbled
words which were lost in a thick blending
together and then advanced across the
apartment and finally sat down in a chair
well within the rectangle of olivettas vi-
sion she glimpsed his profile as he went
by-and there was nothing about it to in-
dicate that this was the father of pretty
jacqueline his features were small and
apparently they had been further reduced
by heavy battering so that the profile was
little more than a straight line slightly dim-
pled the bulge of the scowling brows was
well nigh as large as the nose or the great
out-thrusting lower jaw he was plainly
a man made for conflict
  the lean and active muscles of youth
had been clothed to be sure with outer
layers of fat but fat in turn must have
been converted into flesh and from flesh
to muscle for wide and round as he was
he seemed as hard as iron even the flesh
of his face was hard the drink-reddened
cheeks seemed covered with a colored leath-
er when he sat down his back was to-
ward olivetta but the back was hardly less
imposing than the side view
  he was poised gingerly upon the chair
with his feet drawn well back to the side
so that he could support his bulk upon
them if need were and he overflowed the
chair in all directions just as his great neck
overflowed the white shining collar with
which he was so absurdly throttled he
looked as though he must be between forty-
five and fifty strong as hercules and a
fighter for the love of pure battle
  opposite him and facing the closet
where she watched was john hodge a lithe
the stranger
at the gate

and ineffectually slender figure in compari-
son but there was that in his lounging
carelessness which was hardly less formid-
able than the downright bulk of tom when
one regarded the pair in contrast for a
time
   my girls been down talking said
tom by way of introduction
   yes queried john hodge politely
   sure said tom  when a girl gets
mad she tells everything she knows and
jack has been down chattering a lot about
your pearls
   she seemed to admire them said john
hodge  was that what brought you up
here tom
   fact is said tom rolling his bulk a
little in the chair  fact is that youre a
fool to keep them pearls rolling around
loose the way you do hodge
   i havent kept them rolling around so
loose said hodge  matter of fact
theres only one person in the house thats
seen them-jacqueline
   what sort of puzzles me said tom
and his great voice here rolled out into a
great volume under it choked the room
with his thunder what sort of puzzles
me is that youd trust a girl before youd
trust a man like me aint all women fools
hodge
   in part i suppose said hodge smil-
ing
   but look here hodge aint i been a
friend to you aint i acted the part of a
man that can be trusted
 youve given me a place to live said
hodge  but i think ive paid you for it
 paid cried tom  can a man be
paid for keeping the neck of another man
from stretching
   ah said hodge  is that it is that
in your head tom
   and why not im not a fool hodge
i know what im doing for you
   when i dragged you out of the river
like a half dead rat a few years back said
john hodge  i knew what i was doing
also
  olivetta gasping at his cool imperti-
nence wondered if this were the proper way
to conciliate the big man
   thats old stuff said tom  thats
damned old stuff i pretty near forgot
about it
   but at the end of three years said
hodge  do you expect that i shall have
forgotten about what youre doing for me
now tom
   the point is said tom  that you
aint treated jacqueline right you sure
been talking rough to her or she never
would of come down to me like she done
 nonsense said john hodge setting
his teeth  do you think that im a fool
tom do you think that id dare to of-
fend her in this house if i could help it
why man i know what you could do i
know the fellows you have at your beck
and call i know that id be helpless if
you saw fit to close your hand over me 
this speech seemed to greatly pacify the
big man he leaned back in his chair
which creaked as though it were on the
very verge of crashing to the floor under
its burden
   you got a lot of sense in you hodge
he said  thats why it looks so damn
queer to me that you aint got the sense to
let me shove those pearls of yours into the
safe theyd ride there as safe as daisies
wouldnt they
  he broke off this proposal to fall into a
violent fit of coughing which was no doubt
assumed to save his expression john
hodge looked squarely at his host nodding
as though he seriously considered the offer
   couldnt think of letting you do that
tom he said  its bad enough for you
to be taking me on here as a roomer but
if they should grab me here you could say
that you never saw me except on the day
when i hired the room and that was a
dark day of a thunderstorm
  he shook his head in an increased vio-
lence
   but if they found the pearls in the
safe-why it would be all up with you
theyd give you a sentence at your time
of life which would mean prison the rest
of your days
  tom showed no determination to follow
up this tack he merely sighed and began
to stir restlessly in his chair
   i might as well be going down he
said  if you aint going to see reason

argosy-allstory weekly
   about the pearls
   them and jack and-why hodge
shes terrible fond of you i never seen her
take to anybody the way shes taken to
you most of the boys why she simply
passes em the icy mitt and cant see em
inside of a mile you know that youre
making a bum play to kid her like you been
doing hodge arid if i believed the half
of what shes been telling me-why you
and me couldnt come to no agreement by
just talk after that itd take a pile
moren talk
   you wait till theres a real reason
said hodge  shes talking through her
hat just now
   ill be going down below said tom
and heaved his bulk out of the squeaking
chair
  he strode out of the line of olivettas
sight then he paused again
   but you might give me a look at them
pearls he said  after jacks been telling
me about them there aint no harm in a
look i guess am i right hodge
  for the least fraction of a second john
hodge hesitated then he scooped out the
jewels from his pocket
   no harm at all he said
  he held them up so that the electric light
glimmered over them and tom came sud-
denly back and bowed his misshapen head
over the treasure
  my god breathed tom stepping
back at last  my god hodge youre
rich-youre rich as hell
  he came closer again
   fyou mind me just taking them in my
hand he said with something childlike in
his whispering voice
  they were poured into his great cupped
hands and he began shifting them so that
different lights might fall upon them
   theyd be breaking the heart of one
of these millionaires wives i guess he
said  i can see her putting them around
her throat hodge god how theyd look
against the throat and the breast of one of
them beauties
   theyre turning you into a poet said
hodge smiling and slapping the other on
the shoulder
  at the blow his landlord started violently
and glared at hodge as though roughly
awakened from delightful dreams to brutal
commonplace
  take em he gasped take em
back hodge
  he fairly thrust them into the hands of
john hodge and then turned his back and
lurched out of the room with his peculiar
and clumsy gait the door banged behind
him and his noisy tread went off down the
hall
  john hodge opened the closet door
   youre saved then breathed olivetta
 but oh how could you face that terrible
man
   you really think were through the
pinch he asked curiously
  she looked more closely at him he was
worn and gray
   arent you
   were lost he said  theres not a
ghost of a hope for us now unless the girl-
no shes out of it now even jack couldnt
save us i knew it the minute he asked
to see the pearls there was no way to
refuse him and yet once he had seen them
the wolf came up in him and looked out
at his eyes hell never sleep till he has
those pearls and-listen
  he glided to the door and turned the key
softly in the lock an instant later the knob
of the door was wrenched violently over and
the whole door shook under a sudden pres-
sure
chapter xxv
the trap
john hodge turned to olivetta with a
pointing finger and a half rueful half
sardonic smile as though to say that the
danger he had prophesied had already come
   hello hodge called a voice from the
hall a voice which was carefully smoothed
but in which the snarl of disappointment
could not be quite kept down  let me
in will you whats the idea of locking
the door
   whos with you countered hodge
there was an instant of silence then
the answer in tones still more sullen  no-
bodys here but me
the stranger at the gate	
  hodge laughed
   youve some sort of a joke up your
sleeve billy he said  i heard two of
you coming up the hall
  another one of those ominous little si-
lences followed then with a frank savag-
ery you got the ears of a cat hodge
and if you got the claws of a cat maybe you
can scratch your way out of this hole eh
it was the declaration of war and im-
mediately upon its heels a heavy weight
crashed against the door and made it sag
in yet it held and the sudden echo struck
through the distant rooms of the house
   if you do that again said john hodge
 ill drive a pair of bullets through the
door billy i hate to be bothered like
this and if you keep nagging me ill send
a couple of you to hell 
   listen to the damn dude said one of
those in the hall  well tear your hide
off for that you swine
  another voice boomed suddenly down
the hall
   here here what in hell is all this
get out of my way what you trying to
do to hodge aint he my friend ill
be learning a couple of you boys some les-
sons in good manners if you bother him
  it was tom again and his heavy lurch-
ing step could be traced in its progress to-
ward the door while the men greeted him
with sullen grumblings
   hello john called tom  open up
the door ill find out whats been in the
minds of these blockheads and skin a couple
of em for it
 show me their skins when youre
through with them said hodge  and ill
open the door to you thats a bargain
 what are you after hodge roared
the giant
   its no good tom said hodge  no
good at all i wont open the door and if
you try to break it down ill stick a chunk
of lead through the wood i mean it too
a wild burst of cursing roared from the
throat of tom he threw away the last
pretense with an open threat
   youre going to try a hard hand with
me kid why ill bust you in two ill
get you hodge and get everything you
have do you hear
  but john hodge turned from the door
with a shrug of his shoulders in vain
tom bellowed in the hall his reproaches for
the  ingratitude  of hodge he got no
answer and with a final declaration that
hodge would be starved until he was a sick
dog and gave in the big man and his fol-
lowers departed all save one who was told
to stay behind and was noisily instructed to
blow the head off any one who attempted
to leave the room
  john hodge came back and stood before
olivetta
   when i was at your house he whis-
pered  i heard some one talked about
the way you could handle a revolver was
that true are you a good shot
   fairly good
   then take this
  he pushed a long thirty-eight into her
hands
   what does that leave you
   nothing but my hands he held them
up grimly and moved the fingers a little
in a way that made her blood run cold
 but theyre better than a gun to me
he said  i cant hit the side of a wall
with powder and lead you can do better
than that i hope
  she nodded it was so unnatural for this
big fellow to whisper that the sibilant sound
of it put her nerves on edge with a greater
fear than ever
   you really mean it she murmured
  he nodded
   and you want me to use it-when-
when-
   whenever you please he said  the
gang of men in this house are a hardy crew
if you can get rid of a few of them youll
be doing a service to society ive heard
them talk ive heard of the things theyve
done theres not a one of them that
doesnt deserve hanging and that probably
wont get it sooner or later thats why
i say to shoot and shoot to kill when you
get the chance and keep in mind that if
they have the chance theyll shoot just as
straight at you as though you were a man
i know their kind
  she turned in her hands the cold steel
mechanism then she balanced it and took
the butt in a firm grip it was heavier than

argosy-allstory weekly
the weapons to which she was accustomed
but the balance was good and by maintain-
ing a strong hold on it she should be able
to shoot well
   ill do exactly as you want said oli-
vetta  ill shoot to kill
  something about her expression made him
wince and she heard him murmur to him-
self  poor child she wondered at that
but there were so many sudden changes so
many unexplained phases to john hodge
that she no longer tried to understand every-
thing he did
   let me tell you this he said still in
the cautious whisper which they were forced
to use  that even if i had done all the
things you think i have done the thing
which would most damn me would be be-
cause my affair has dragged you into this
hole
  but olivetta shook her head
   no she said thoughtfully  that isnt
fair i started out to trail you john hodge
and if i could i would have turned you
over to the police but instead i was drawn
into the trap and you saved me after
id compromised you if i had not come
to-night youd be in no danger youd
be-smoking cigarettes with jacqueline
right now
  she managed the faintest of smiles john
hodge seemed greatly moved
   good god he breathed  what a great
hearted girl you are but ill talk no more
about regrets well look only one way
and thats toward the possibilities of getting
away
   from the window- she suggested
   theres no way down from that oh
when they gave me this room i took stock
of it you may be sure theres a narrow
ledge running past the window but only a
circus performer could walk on it thats
the only possible exit and theres no
chance of getting in help if we start a
clamor theres no one in this block of
houses to hear and there are empty lots
behind the house
   but even if we should be heard it
would be too late if it were the last thing
that tom lanier were capable of he would
knock in the door to finish the man who
betrayed his hiding place for this house
is almost as precious as life to tom hes
been condemned to death three times and
three times hes broken away only to be
caught tried under another name in an-
other country and held again but this
time hes hidden himself safely away for
months in this house and be believes that
his luck is tied up with it if we raised a
racket that would bring the police here
theyd find empty rooms except for the
one that held our bodies i know honest
tom
   then-what can we do gasped oli-
vetta
   i dont know-i honestly dont know
i see no hope
  panic rushed through her brain
   there must be some way out whis-
pered olivetta
  he stepped close to her with a look of the
greatest anxiety
   you understand he said  that im
not holding out on account of the pearls
if they would buy us freedom id give them
in an instant but they wouldnt count if
tom lanier takes the pearls he takes my
life with them-he would be a fool not to
now that he has the opportunity and if
he finishes me he finishes off the only other
witness no matter whether its a man or a
woman ive heard that great beast of a
man talk before now ive heard him
say that the trouble with most criminals
is that they stop halfway in their crimes
as for his own methods they are the height
of thoroughness
  she made a little gesture of resignation
then she leaned back against the wall with
her arms folded for it seemed that her
heart would thunder its way out of her
body
  at last  is there water in the room
she asked
  here he said hastily and stepped
to a wash basin in the corner but when
he turned the tap the water did not flow
   theyve cut us off from the water line
he said  thats tom lanier again he
loses no time he knows food is nothing-
water is the quick finisher he came back
to her  god knows how sorry i am  he
said
  she was sick at heart her knees were
the stranger at the gate

shaking under her weight she wanted to
drop to the floor and pray and weep and
cry out to the brutal guard beyond the
door for mercy but the watching eye of
this man who leaned above her held her
together she could not weaken while he
was there looking on
   listen to me she said and the effort
to control her emotion made her voice
hard and dry  we havent time to accuse
each other of whats past please believe
that im thinking only of this moment and
none other and - and - but theres
something at the window
  for there had come a light scratching
sound just outside the window and it un-
nerved olivetta and sent her cowering back
in the comer of the room there with
staring eyes and with the revolver leveled
she waited for the first stir of the lowered
pane ready to shoot john hodge stepped
to the side of the room he paused with
lowered head by the window listening and
at that moment there was a light furtive
tapping at the pane
  for an instant he hesitated seeming to
doubt whether he should signal to the girl
to shoot or else wait for a more definite
proof tliat there was some one just outside
the window but finally he did neither he
gripped the lower sash of the window and
thtew it up it revealed a glimmering bit of
white paper hanging at the end of a cord
which was weighted down with a pencil
chapter xxvi
 only one chance
john hodge caught at the paper and
brought it in instantly the upper end
of the string was loosed and came flut-
tering in to the room he lowered the sash
again and unfolding the paper eagerly
read the contents and then passed it without
a word to olivetta
  the paper was thin the writing had been
done with an indelible pencil the impression
being very faint on the smooth surface and
the writing was crowded together closely
it was by no means the sort of hand she
would have expected to come from jacque-
line lanier and yet it was from her
   dear john ran the letter  i dont
know what strange devil came into my
head and made me do the terrible thing
but i have done it and now i am sitting
in my room above yours and wondering
how i can undo the harm i have done
  here she looked up from the writing and
watched john hodge standing patiently on
the farther side of the room studying a
problem which seemed difficult of solution
the letter went on
   it was the thought that you had only
been playing with me that drove me mad
it seemed to me that you had been jesting
from the first-and i had taken your friend-
ship seriously but now i know that i must
have been wrong
   at least i want to try to make up for
what i have done and i think i can first
ill tell you exactly what ive done i must
do that before you will trust me and if
you dont trust me there is no way in
which  can now be of help to you
   i went down to father in the first rage
i found him in the dumps his arras folded
on a table his head on his arms i should
have known better than to tell him any
exciting news when he was in such a mood
but before i knew it i had told the whole
story of what i had seen
   and from the expression on his face i
knew that i had said too much he lis-
tened like a starved man he began to
moisten his lips and smile in a peculiar
starved way he went up to see you at
once what he said to you i dont know
but when he came back i knew by the
first glance at his face that he had seen the
pearls
   he went to work at once he called
up the boys from below he told them
that they were to get at you and that if
they did  finish  you there would be a
richer haul than all the hauls they had ever
made before rolled into one then he told
them what to do and they started for your
room
   i had had a chance to cool off by that
time i tried to change his mind but it
was too late nothing that i could do would
save you if i had to rely on persuasion i
waited in a cold terror until i heard that
they had failed to get into your room i

argosy-allstory weekly
suppose that something father said made
you suspect and you were on your guard
when they came for you
   by that time i had thought of the only
way in which you could escape even that
way is dangerous but ive come to offer
it john if you will trust me to help you
simply wave your hand out of the window
and i shall lower a rope to you you will
find it knotted so that you can easily climb
up and from this room youll have an
even chance of slipping out of the house
without being seen
   john  know that i have thrown you
into this danger but trust me to take you
out of it again
                             jack
  she lowered the letter and looked across
the room to john hodge
    there is a hope then  she breathed
   i wonder mused john hodge  the
chances i think are about two in ten
but shall we take them even so
   yes yes anything to make a start
without water-why wed die in three
days if they cared to keep us here as long
as that once in that room-
   ah if we could reach that room
but-
   but with a knotted rope-surely you
can climb it and i know that i can manage
some way to get up it
   if the rope holds yes
    if it holds
   aye dont you see that thats the only
dubious point but of course you dont
see you cannot conceive what goes on in-
side the brain of that girl she looks dif-
ferent enough but theres very little of her
father that isnt in her clever and shrewd
suspicious and cunning revengeful as the
very devil cruel as a witch when shes an-
gered-thats what jacqueline is ive had
a rare opportunity to study her and though
ive only had a few days ive found those
things in her
   she likes me fairly well simply be-
cause she thinks that i have been com-
pletely blinded by her little tricks if she
thought i knew her for what she is the dear
girl would slip a knife into roe and kiss her
hand to me as i went out to sea that very
much in brief is my lady jacqueline
  but do you actually think- gasped
olivetta
   that she would wait until i was nearly
to the top and then cut the rope and drop
me a few stories down to the hard pave-
ment below i dont know in fact i may
as well tell you what i tried to hint at a
while ago i have tried to make jacqueline
think that i was about to become her en-
tirely blinded admirer if she believes that
i am sincere she may attempt the rescue in
good faith but if she really believes that
i have not been truthful shell cut the rope
and let me go
  he made a gesture to indicate the drop
 it would smash a man a fall like that
a gunshot through the head couldnt be
more fatal and after im up even sup-
posing that i get there it might not be so
extremely simple to handle her and keep
her silent while you climb the rope after
me you begin to see the difficulties
olivetta appalled reviewed them in her
mind but she was very young she was
very strong she had within her a wealth
of unspent adventure moreover in john
hodge she saw the very spirit of invincible
strength and courage thief and murderer
he might be-yes she had reason to feel
confident that he was-but he was also
capable of being a matchless gentleman
thinking only of the woman who was with
him even if it were she who had drawn
all this peril on his head in these last
few moments his ugly hawklike face had
become almost handsome in her eyes
   it only seems to me she said  that
there is really nothing else to do am i
wrong
   unless the police should come on the
trail of tom lanier or of john hodge-
and so liberate us
   and so bring you to prison	
   thats a danger of the future and the
future is a very dim thing our present
danger is a concrete fact but i truly be-
lieve that the odds are against the police
finding me here or finding tom lanier
he has stayed here several months why
should he be trailed here now it would
be entirely too improbable
   then you think we should go
   if we try to climb that rope he said
the stranger at the gate	
slowly  i know that we shall risk our lives
and yet if we stay here-
    its just the same risk isnt it
suddenly he struck the back of his hand
across his eyes
   i see you swinging up there in the
middle of sick thin space and it takes the
heart out of me gad it makes me weak 
she stared at him and it seemed to
her that if ever she had seen sincerity
stamped deep in the features of a man she
could see it now stamped on the face of
this tall john hodge that lean and ugly
face as he bent above her
  then  but youre right he said
 youre entirely right theres only one
chance and we must take it if it were
any other place if they were any other
men i should take the chance alone and
leave you here knowing that a woman
would be safe but in this house-no no
you must come with me if anything
should happen to you-but nothing shall
happen nothing shall happen god help-
ing
  and again a quiver of wonder ran
through all of her nerves indeed he
seemed sincere he must be sincere unless
some devil kept him acting with a consum-
mate skill up to the very last moment
   you see she said gently  i take the
risk of my own free will
   i know i knowr-well well forget the
rest
  he took her hand and crushed it between
both of his and both his strong hands were
trembling
   if only i had not come  she said  if
only i had let you go
   but do you really wish that well
i dont all the danger that comes to a
man-thats fate but the happiness is
another matter and ive found some hap-
piness out of your coming when you first
came you looked on me as a sort of cold-
blooded devil isnt that true but if we
come through this safe and sound i think
youll have a slightly different feeling about
me is that true a feeling that i am at
least not so bad as some men eh a feel-
ing let me say that i can admire grit and
pay homage to a girl with courage
  she found herself listening after he had
stopped speaking as she might have lis-
tened to music too delightful to have end-
ed and she roused herself with an effort
it was the old story  the moment she came
near this man she was drawn mightily to-
ward him her reason could not keep her
at arms distance
  john hodge had gone to the window and
raised the sash softly she saw him lean
out and looking up wave his hand in a
broad gesture into the night and as he
did so a twining length of rope dropped
past him and was swept into the room as
he straightened again
  his gesture brought olivetta on hasty
tiptoe
   its strong enough he said and he
tested the rope with a great tug of his
hands  it will carry our weight unless
she does something to it above-or unless
her father is in the room with her in
that case well get quickly what otherwise
would have been delayed and prefixed with
a long agony are you sure that you can
climb
   when i was a youngster i used to
climb i still can manage it
   i could draw you up but i shall prob-
ably have my hands too full with her try-
ing to keep her quiet while you climb
wait for a moment or two after you see me
disappear into the window above if i can
reach it at all and then start yourself
  so saying he stood up on the sill of the
window reached up as high on the rope as
he could and with his first effort swung a
yard or more clear of the wall of the house
chapter xxvii
the alarm
she saw him swing hand over hand up
the rope with an incredible display of
strength and agility while the rope
swung wildly back and forth below was
a great black pit with an unseen bottom
  then out of the blackness above ap-
peared the dim pallor of a voice she heard
a whisper of encouragement pale hands
went out toward the climber and seemed
to help him in his last upward effort and
so he was brought to the sill of the win-

argosy-allstory weekly
clow above ana an instant later disappeared
into the interior
  that was not all the rope swung trem-
bling back and forth once its knotted end
actually struck against her cheek but
then it was whisked away and withdrawn
completely from her reach
  olivetta leaned recklessly out and
watched that last hope swept away and
with a sick falling of the heart ail of her
former doubts of john hodge poured back
over her there was some magic in the
actual presence of the man that kept her
from distrusting him after the first mo-
ments but now her last frail hope of es-
cape was gone he had caught it up with
a consummate selfishness and left her to
whatever might come
  he had made only one mistake he had
left her his revolver and if they rushed
the room they would meet with a grim re-
ception she looked desperately around
the room how blank and empty it was
how utterly devoid of hope since he had
gone then glancing back to the win-
dow she saw the dark and serpentine length
of the rope dangling and twining back on
itself there
  it was a glorious good sight to olivetta
she reached the window in one flurry of
haste and caught at the rope she gripped
it so hard that the harsh fibers bit into her
palm and now leaning out and looking
up again she saw the rope quiver in a
solid straight line while from the window
above it seemed to her that she heard a
light scuffling sound
  that was all she waited for she climbed
hastily onto the sill of the window just as
john hodge had done but she crouched
there and hesitated below her the void of
blackness began to stir as it were and open
enough to show her the dizzy distance to
the ground and the trembling rope was
fragile indeed as a support
  more than that it was many a year since
she had climbed a rope there had been
a time in that wild girlhood of hers when
she would have thought no more than a
sailor going up this rope as handily as john
hodge well nigh those were times when
she had been able to swing like a veritable
monkey through the trees from branch to
branch the delight and the admiration of
the boys with whom she played they
had been stronger but none had been so
daring
  even now when she remembered there
came again a faint pang like an echo of
that great pain with which she had come
to know that she must be only a woman
with all of a womans limitations with a
sigh of fear and of grief and of amusement
she reached up but when her hands set-
tled on the rope each clutching a knot all
was banished except her fear would
there be sufficient strength in her arms to
sustain her
  she closed her eyes and let her weight
fall forward blindly she swung out on the
rope it seemed that she would never
cease swaying out and she began to spin
on the rope the fear was turning her
muscles to water her wrists shook the
fingers grew numb and weak and she felt
her hold slipping
  then she opened her eyes and saw far
above the glittering of the stars and in-
stantly she began to fight her way up the
rope
  a danger met and struggled against she
discovered became less paralyzing than one
in the presence of which she had been trem-
bling the rough rope burned her hands
but in her arms made strong by swinging
a golf club and swimming drew her up
with difficulty but steadily enough and
when she wearied a little below reaching
distance of the window sill above her she
twisted her slim ankles into the rope and
let her weight rest in that fashion
  then she resumed the work until she
could swing a hand in and grasp the sill
then the other arm followed she was drawn
up to the level of the sill and then swung
through and stood at last panting on the
floor safe for that moment at least
  in a farther corner of the room she saw
john hodge busily at work bandaging the
arms of a woman behind her back a woman
already gagged at that instant he ended
his task and lowered the helpless form to
the floor he leaned a moment over it
   i dont like to do it jack he was
whispering  by the lord it goes against
the grain but i knew that the moment
the stranger at the gate	
you saw another person coming up that
rope particularly if it were a woman youd
raise the roof and have that light-handed
father of yours upon us in a twinkling
thats why ive had to do this but be-
sides this will be a lot better for you if
they find you bound and gagged theyll
never dream that youve actually helped
me to escape and as for the girl-theyll
never know i trust that she was in the
house
  the wild bright eyes of the captive
blazed up at him but she made no struggle
   good-by jack said john hodge
stepping back and waving to her  good-
by and better luck next time
  he motioned to olivetta they stole to
the door which opened upon the hall
   there are two- ways out now he whis-
pered softly  but first wait here until
youve stopped breathing so hard it was a
stiff pull to get up the rope
  she nodded drawing in great breaths
   theres time enough well let you
quiet down and then well start but
as i was saying there are two ways out
one is down the fire escape the way you
came up but i think the chances are
that old fox tom lanier is probably keep-
ing a guard on that just in case things
should come to the present pass i say i
think that the odds are ten to one that hes
having the fire escape watched and if he
is were both hopelessly trapped if we try
to go down it
   theres another way and thats to go
straight down the stairs and out of the
house by the front door nobody will be
watching that way out im sure at least
theres a chance thats worth gambling on
i think once we get past the hall below
where the guard is waiting wed have clear
sailing will you have the nerve to go down
that way you wont break down
  she shook her head her heart was thun-
dering but she would not admit her fear
it was better to go on in his guidance doing
blindly what he told her to do he had
already brought her to the threshold of es-
cape she felt
  he waited watching her a moment at
length he nodded
   i think we may make the attempt now
and so-well make a prayer for good luck
and go ahead
  so saying he opened the door and
stepped boldly out into the hall olivetta
following felt her breath taken as though
she had plunged into icy water but she
went on behind him and now she remem-
bered that when she started to climb the
rope she had left behind her the unneces-
sary weight of the revolver-unnecessary
then but how vital now
  even in her anxiety she could find time
to wonder at the stealthy silence of the
movements of john hodge the big man
stalked down the hall before her fairly dis-
solving into the darkness of the passageway
without leaving a trace of noise behind him
she herself with all her advantage of a
lighter weight could not avoid slight whis-
pering sounds slight creakings
  and the difficulties of proceeding noise-
lessly were redoubled when they reached the
stairway for here even john hodge made
some noise and she herself stopped time
and again crouching in horror at the
squeaking of the boards under foot but
never once did he turn to her with a cau-
tioning gesture
  and so they reached the bottom of that
flight and here he held up a hand to keep
her back she stopped and looking back
she wondered at the shortness of the de-
scent for there had been a year of dread
in it
   listen murmured john hodge
  she threw her whole heart into the effort
and above them she heard an irregular and
rapid beating a sort of heavy flutter of
sound
   its jacqueline fighting to get free
whispered hodge  little tigress-shell
probably succeed before long i hadnt the
heart to sink the cords into her as far as
they should have gone shell work out of
them but the guard has heard already
and hes coming to investigate whats caus-
ing the racket 
  in fact up the hall came the thud of the
guards foot felt in the vibration of the
floor rather than heard and to the horror
of olivetta john hodge stepped squarely
out from behind the wall and into the view
of the approaching man

rgosy-allstory weekly
 the latter halted
  what in hell- he gasped
  hello hello grumbled john hodge
 in a roughened and deepened voice  you
 aint asleep yet eh
  who is it said the other approach-
 ing nearer in their direction  i dunno that
 i remember-
  tom sent me up to jacks room you
 must of been asleep when i come by going
 up
  you lie i aint closed an eye what
 you been doing
 the answer was only one of those inde-
 scribable intakes of breath when a man
 leaps into action there was a startled snarl
 half formed from the throat of the guard
and then a quick thud as of a fist striking
home followed by a jarring fall
  olivetta ran out into the hall she saw
a form in the dim light prone on the floor
john hodge was already turning toward
her
  now run for it he said eagerly
 dont mind the noise now weve got to
get out before he comes to and that  be
just a matter of seconds
  they turned side by side for the next
flight of stairs but each halted and shrank
before beginning the descent for a door
was suddenly cast open on the floor above
and the voice of jacqueline rang through
the house sharp with fear and rage  hes
loose-john hodge-
 to be concluded next week

for gossip why theyll have a
regular feast phyllis soliloquized
bitterly as she packed her trunk going
about it with an anxious-to-shake-the-dirt-
of-this-place-off-my-fee sort of air silk
stockings and silk  other things  were
piled in a rebellious heap
  she heard graham go into the hall and
take his hat off the rack heard him walk
toward the bedroom and then abruptly turn
away a moment later the outer door
slammed he had left the house
   brute she muttered flinging a bottle
of french toilet water viciously into her
gold-mounted black morocco suit case
  just a year ago phyllis the spoiled
motherless daughter of a millionaire had
eloped with a man who had nothing to
offer her but love and prospects she had
met john graham while visiting a college
chum and with both it had been a case
of love at first sight graham who during
his thirty odd years had been a student
in the school of hard knocks had suggest-
ed waiting until he was better established

but she had declared that she would
 adore housework and being deeply in
love he had closed his ears to prudence
and opened them wide to inclination
  experience proved her wrong she did
not adore housework washing dishes and
cooking even with the assistance of a by-
the-hour colored maid was sadly different
from her romantic expectations at first
the young wife was delighted with the nov-
elty of the four room bungalow but re-
sponsibility was new and soon became irk-
some gradually she drifted back to her
old frivolous life demanding luxuries quite
beyond the reach of the wife of john gra-
ham her husband who idolized her
plunged harder than ever into his work
trying to give phyllis some of the things
which she was continually reminding him
she had always had
  the climax had come that morning gra-
ham was making toast at the kitchen stove
when his wife appeared in the doorway
looking like a fluffy chicken masking as a
bird of paradise with her disheveled yellow
hair and gorgeous pastel-shaded negligee

argosy-allstory weekly
his surprise-as it was long before her cus-
tomary rising hour-had been largely mixed
with apprehension which was well founded
for she immediately plunged into the unset-
tled argument of the night before
   well john are you more sensible this
morning she demanded perching herself
on the edge of one of the blue enameled
chairs and rubbing her sleepy pansy eyes
   if you mean have i changed my mind
-no phyllis
   how can you be so unkind pouting
down at her blue satin slippers she looked
as strangely out of place in the miniature
kitchen as did the tall dignified man in his
shirt sleeves bending over the coffee pot
 taxi bills run up frightfully really i
could almost own a car for what i spend
on them im only asking for a little run-
about although you know that at home-
   but i explained all that last night
phyllis graham broke in the lines deep-
ening on his careworn face  its abso-
lutely out of the question until business
improves even the taxis will have to stop
   oh will they mockingly  what
do you expect me to do ride in street
cars well i wont ill go back to fa-
ther first you dont love me or you would
not make me a laughing stock for my
friends and i was a fool to marry you-a
fool a fool a jool she had risen and was
brandishing her closed fists spoiled child
fashion the last  fool  being fairly
screamed at her husband who had stopped
his preparations of a hurried breakfast
  although not the type of man one could
suitably call a worm graham certainly
did turn if he could have explained the
serious problems facing him at the factory
-which he couldnt as greek was more
intelligible to phyllis than assets and lia-
bilities-his gentle tolerance might not have
deserted him but the strain of many sleep-
less nights and harried days together with
her incessant complaining broke down the
wall of his patience
   stop it he commanded although the
stern set of his lip was belied by the pain
in his gray eyes  ive tried to make you
understand but either you cant or wont
god knows im doing the best i can but
instead of giving you more money ill have
to cut down expenses if you think youll
be happier at your fathers phyllis maybe
youd better go back
  phyllis stared at him in angry astonish-
ment it was the first time he had not
petted and coaxed her out of her tantrums
   i will go she cried her blue eyes turn-
ing black with rage  youre a beast
john graham and a miser and ill never
come back never never
   i wont ask you to wearily  for im
afraid our marriage was a mistake
   beast she cried again and with her
silken robe flying she flung herself into the
bedroom and locked the door then she
began packing
ii
  that evening she walked in upon her
father who having promptly disowned her
upon her marriage had not seen her for a
year mr smyth who was a stock yards
magnate and looked it puffed thoughtfully
at his havana as she told her hysterical
story in the library he seemed far from
displeased at the return of the prodigal
daughter
   im not surprised he told her  i
didnt think youd go through with it no
dont interrupt me phyllis its my fault
as much as yours a poor mans wife must
be a good honest piece of crockery able
to stand hard bumps without breaking or
even nicking i made a dainty dresden
china doll out of you and with my money
and your schooling i figured on getting
some blue blood into the family ill let
you come back home on condition that your
separation from that man is permanent
well go down and see about the divorce
to-morrow
   to-morrow phyllis choked down a
sob  theres no hurry is there dad
   no-o-o i suppose not with carefully
simulated indifference  just go ahead
and enjoy yourself
  as phyllis predicted her return was a
feast for the gossips and she sensed it in
spite of the acclaim with which she was
welcomed
  ray kensington alexer was among the
first to call accompanied by his mother a
stoutish white haired lady who wore real
a daughter of midas

beads with an air the alexers had been
among the pilgrim fathers-so had the
kensingtons mrs alexer found it rather
inconvenient however to keep up the fam-
ily splendor on the family income
  while ray and phyllis exchanged merry
badinage mamma alexer and papa smyth
exchanged significant glances
   its simply great to see you phyl
drawled ray  your husband - didnt
come eh
   john no with a vigorous shake of
her fluffy blond head  hes too busy
johns a regular human adding machine
 im doing some adding myself right
now ray laughingly asserted  trying to
put two and two together freedom of an
old friend you know
   i always thought two and two made
four phyllis smiled impishly up at him
from the velvety depths of the tall mahog-
any chair after her jaunt into poormans
land she was pleasantly conscious of the
gorgeousness of the oriental rugs the
creamy softness of the satin wall hang-
ings and the luxury of the silently moving
footman serving tea in eggshell china cups
her companion too-slim distinguished
looking faultlessly groomed fitted into the
general luxuriousness ah this was her
world she thought contentedly
   two and two do make four agreed
ray  but one and one- now in our
case leaning confidentially toward her  i
had expected-
   expectation never hurts its realiza-
tion thats tragic
   right-o but with an aggrieved air
 it was a scurvy trick you played on me
nobody would ever dream as you sit there
looking like a yellow angel-
   yellow this dress is peach color
   is it well you certainly look lus-
cious in it and if you dont stop smiling at
me in that  come hither  way-
   be careful ray demurely  dont
forget that im a married woman
   are you too much married to play
eighteen holes to-morrow
   absolutely unless relenting  we
get up a foursome
  which they did this was the first of
many days spent at the country club and
it was remarkable how quickly phyllis
slipped back into her old niche of popular-
ity loaded down with gold from her fa-
thers coffers-which like hawthornes
 miraculous pitcher were ahvays full and
running over-she indulged in unrestrained
shopping orgies and plunged with feverish
gayety into a round of teas and dances and
dinners
  at an exclusive affair one evening mr
smyth-a fat pudgy figure in spite of his
gentlemanly attire-stood watching her
with exultant satisfaction her eyes spar-
kling like twin sapphires her hair burnished
gold against the cobwebby midnight blue of
a gown upon which sparsely scattered iri-
descents glistened like drops of dew she was
the center of an admiring group the most
worshipful of whom was ray
  smyth-who had been  smith  before
the war had made him a multimillionaire-
was obsessed with one idea having no
pedigree of his own he wanted to buy one
and it was through his pretty daughter that
he had planned on getting it to this end
he had had her carefully trained hothouse
fashion and her elopement had been a
bitter blow he had shrewdly foreseen
however that if he disowned her-luxury
being woven into the very fiber of her being
-back she would come when the lash of
poverty scourged her flesh he smiled com-
placently as he realized the correctness of
his prediction true she had thus far
evaded his suggestions as to a divorce but
that would come 
  he knew that john graham was strug-
gling along on a shoestring he knew also
that his largest debt was to the shannon
company in which smyth himself hap-
pened to be a director and a large stock-
holder he had but to say the word--
unconsciously he closed his large rather
puffy hand as though in the act of crushing
a small helpless fly
  phyllis passing him wtith ray in her
wake stopped at that moment
   ray is going to drive me home dad
she said turning her flushed pretty face to
his  you dont mind do you
   wouldnt do me much good if i did
with pretended displeasure  you be care-
ful you two and dont go over sixty miles

argosy-allstory weekly
an hour i dont want to be getting you
out of jail at daybreak
   no danger sir laughed ray  im
more liable to make it a mile an hour
  in the machine phyllis leaning back
noticed how the white moonbeams gave a
spectral appearance to the shrubs and trees
which waved their arms fantastically who
can control the mind in scenes like this
balmy moonlight nights in the little road-
ster which john had afterward sold to make
a  down payment  on their bungalow-
nights when the swaying trees and whisper-
ing wind had played an exquisite symphony
to accompany the melody which love was
playing on their heartstrings it was on
such nights that against her will john came
into her thoughts intuitively she knew that
her companion was feeling the intoxicating
influence of their surroundings now as for
herself-
   why the sigh
   i hardly know with a reckless sigh
letting the hand he had taken remain in
his  guess i hate to think of such a glo-
rious moonlight night ever coming to an
end
  abruptly ray stopped the car in the
leafy whispering road  an echo of my
own thoughts he whispered she felt his
hot breath on her cheek as he went on un-
steadily  wonderful girl have you any
idea how much i love you
   do you-really
   you know i do why wont you get
your divorce phyllis and marry me
promise me now to-night that you will
she allowed herself to be swept into his
arms she even let him kiss her assuring
herself that she was supremely happy yet
she did not find the experience particularly
exhilarating
  pushing him away she drew her ermine
wrap about her  i suppose i should
she answered  and i will some time
with this ray had to be contented he
scowled at the wheel as they proceeded on
their way his lips set to repress words
which would not have been at all in keeping
with the wondrous scene and his wondrous
companion
  phyllis thought the conversation over as
her maid helped her prepare for bed ray
was right a divorce was the only thing
she could not go back to that beggarly
existence as for john-she never wanted
to see him again and evidently he felt the
same way she told herself bitterly for she
had never had so much as a word from him
in all the months of their separation well
he would hear from her soon she deter-
mined through an attorney
  the very next morning she was spurred
on to act it was her birthday and her
father on leaving the house asked her to
go out with him to the drive under the
massive archway built on one side of the
gray stone mansion stood a long tawny
roadster luxuriously upholstered in choco-
late brown-a car so powerfully made and
yet so symmetrically beautiful that phyllis
gave a gasp of delight
   is it for me she asked excitedly
    yes a little birthday gift
   why dad you dear youre always
doing things for me
   am i kitten well suppose you do
something for me to-day well christen
this car together not with a bottle of cham-
pagne but with a trip to lloyds office
   your attorney
   yes youve never heard from gra-
ham youve told me and it seems to me
that your pride if nothing else-
   youre right dad well go to-day
  smyth suppressed a triumphant smile
   sensible girl he commended
  after the case was started phyllis was
conscious of a feeling of expectancy but
no word came from john and his apparent
indifference enraged her  i hate him
she fumed inwardly  i only wish hed
come to court so i could show him how-
little i care
  she expressed her desire to  have it over
with to ray who frequently accompanied
her on long rides in the new roadster
   i can hardly wait for the time when
i can claim you he told her ardently he
did not tell her that her fathers millions
had something to do with his impatience
nor that he considered it quite something
to give people of no lineage the exalted
name of kensington-alexer he really felt
quite magnanimous about it
   still she was a prize family or no family
a daughter of midas

he admitted as he watched her run the car
with dexterous skill refusing to let any
one else have the wheel she would throw
off her hat and with hair flying and eyes
sparkling would whizz down the long
smooth roads looking like a picture of
poetry in motion
  twice she was arrested for speeding and
twice she listened demurely to her fathers
warning reprimand as he paid her fines and
allowed her to drive him home at the rate of
ten miles an hour
   that cars put the devil into you he
grumbled
  she laughed  every time i get my foot
on the accelerator and my hand on the
wheel it seems to dare me
   cant understand it you used to be
such a sane driver
  phyllis herself could not understand it
she seemed to be trying to run away from
her own thoughts-from fits of restlessness
she did not attempt to analyze these moods
-she simply tried to escape from them
  in spite of the lawyers precautions the
paper printed a sensational story of the im-
pending divorce under the blazing caption
society belle who eloped seeks
divorce
phyllis hoped john would see the account
the charges of  cruelty and neglect  stood
out like a close-up on a movie screen he
couldnt deny them didnt he spend most
of his time at his old factory and didnt he
cruelly deny her the decencies of life
   i dont see how it got into the papers
she remarked to ray
   neither do i im not sorry though
it kind of casts the die and brings you that
much nearer to me
   does it
   doesnt it look out phyl as she
turned a curve with dangerous abruptness
  she was in one of her reckless moods
ray vowed that after she was married to
him this foolish speeding would stop hed
see to that at present-
   i cant understand though why he
never made an effort to see you
   he realized it would be useless heav-
ens-he doesnt know what real living
means a little two by four house on main
street a garden some chickens a kitchen
cabinet type of wife in a kitchen cabinet
type of housedress-those things are reali-
ties to him
   and theres always the possibility
suggested ray slyly  of his having met
some one who entertains the same foolish
notions
  phyllis started and gave him a strange
look
   why-why-yes of course but it
was a thought which had never occurred to
her john alone and punished was like a
sop to her vanity but john-and another
woman
  after letting ray out at his club she
drove like mad the idea of john and an-
other woman which ray had hoped would
set her more firmly against her husband
stung her like a mental wasp soon she
was speeding through the poverty section of
the big city pushcarts lined the curbs
men women children and dogs in varying
stages of unwashed squalor cluttered up
the streets it was a section where care-
ful driving was requisite and it always
acted as a brake on phyllis but to-day she
was scarcely aware of her locality the
idea of john kissing another woman loving
another woman getting sympathy from an-
other woman as she was getting it from
ray possessed her why it was unthink-
able
  there was a cry echoed by many voices
in the narrow street a grinding of wheels
as she hastily applied the brake and in a
moment an excited mob was crowding
around the car shouting in many languages
and gesticulating angrily phyllis white as
the imported frock she wore got out as a
policeman pushed back the crowd she
stared at the small unconscious figure that
had been ground beneath the wheels at the
frantic mother moaning in an unintelligible
language as she clasped the child to her
bosom
  but for the policeman things would have
gone hard with phyllis like one in a
dream she found herself starting the car
with mechanical precision and taking the
officer and the wailing mother with her
burden to the hospital after first aid had
been administered in the corner drug store

argosy-allstory weekly
she was calm but her hand on the wheel
was like ice the druggists face the look
in his eyes haunted her if the child should
die she phyllis graham would be- she
dared not finish the thought but her teeth
cut deeply into her lower lip as she smoth-
ered a scream
  in the hospital the little inert form was
carried down the hall and phyllis was left
in the waiting room with the policeman
who sat at a respectful distance-but who
still sat
  presently a tall gaunt nurse came in
her unfriendly eyes like the druggists
spelled disaster phyllis understood that
she was being permitted to leave-with the
policeman
  her lips formed an almost inaudible ques-
tion
   we dont know yet replied the nurse
her cold businesslike manner was madden-
ing
   spare no expense i will pay faltered
phyllis
  l we shall do all we can of course but
money is sometimes quite powerless the
womans voice was contemptuous
  unlike the usual dynamic phyllis was the
white faced girl who told her story in a
sort of numbly horrified way to ray and
her father in the latters study mr smyth
being a man of quick action left at once
to set the powerful wheels of his influence
in motion the girl staring off into space
with a vacant horror in her eyes seemed
scarcely aware of rays presence
   dont be afraid dear he said cheer-
fully  your father is a very influential
man he can fix anything even if the
child should die-
   die she muttered it was the word
which during those long terrible hours she
had kept warding off-pushing out of her
mind slowly she fixed her gaze on him
evidently he thought she was afraid for
herself her eyes filled but she said noth-
ing
  how could she blame him would she
not have felt the same but for the soft body
which had scrunched beneath the wheels a
few hours ago was it a few hours or was
it a year
  the words of the nurse came back to her
 sometimes money is quite powerless all
the money in the world could not efface
the memory of that afternoons experience
  ray rambled on as if the affair were a
mere incident-rather unpleasant of course
but then-a ghetto child too many of
them anyway but although she tried to
smile at his effort to cheer her she was in-
wardly conscious of a growing horror as she
realized that his reasoning would have been
her reasoning had the experience not been
a personal one
iii
  in the days that followed smyth succeed-
ed in obtaining his daughters discharge on
the ground that her negligence was not the
proximate cause of the accident phyllis
asked no questions showed no interest in
the proceedings daily she visited the hos-
pital and daily was met by the brusque
nurse who did not soften her concise bulle-
tins the child was near death phyllis
always left with the vision of the curling lip
and condemnatory eye of the nurse searing
into her soul formerly a complacent ad-
mirer of herself she shrank from the intro-
spective thoughts which were continually
crowding in upon her
   the child fighting for life in the hospital
the divorce case looming up before her
obtruded themselves into every act of her
daily life she wondered dully how other
people could go on thinking the same
thoughts and doing the same things when
such a drastic change had taken place in
her own existence
  at a dinner given one evening in their
magnificent dining room phyllis looked cu-
riously down the long dazzling overloaded
table with its mammoth centerpiece of rare
flowers its sleek well-fed occupants fairly
glittering with prosperity and twittering
with small talk involuntarily her mind
flittered back to a small living room she
saw its modest talking machine its cushion
filled divan its simple bookcase of much
bethumbed well chosen books-for johns
literary taste was of the best-and as she
listened to the frothy conversation buzzing
around her she experienced a sensation
somewhat like a small boy who has eaten
too much pie
a daughter of midas

  after the guests had gone smyth went
into the library to glance over the evening
paper whither phyllis soon followed she
dreaded to go to her room-to be alone
with her thoughts
  at last her father looked up from his
paper  for heavens sake sit down
phyllis he growled  whats the matter
with you
   nothing
   h-m probably some gewgaw you saw
to-day and opening a drawer in the pol-
ished mahogany table he drew out a check
book
  but phyllis springing forward pushed it
from him  dont dad i cant stand the
sight of money to-night--not even a check
her nervous little laugh caused mr smyth
to shoot a glance at her from his steely
blue eyes  im tired i guess good
night and she abruptly left him
  looking after her frowningly he shook
his head if that confounded divorce case
were only over hed make sure the next
day that the girl should not change her
mind
  troubles like twins seem to come in
pairs it was the day before the divorce
hearing that the physician more communi-
cative than the dour faced nurse informed
phyllis that the night would bring a crisis-
the child would either pass out or turn life-
ward in the scale
  in a voice she could hardly control phyl-
lis repeated the doctors words to ray
who was waiting for her in the car and add-
ed that she would return after dinner
   but phil you cant come back ray
reminded her  dont you know that this
is the opening night of the opera and that
you and your father are going in our
party
   i cant go
   you dont mean that youre going to
miss the first night of the opera
   opera she jerked out god the
words came from between her set teeth of its
own volition
  and in spite of the combined persuasion
of ray and her father she did not go to the
opera that night a tense solitary figure
she sat huddled up just outside the room
where the child lay-waiting waiting the
eyes which had always overflowed at the
slightest provocation were now dry and
burning they were viewing mental pic-
tures she saw the little girls russian
father a tailor in one of the down town
sweat shops the thin overworked mother
and the other four poorly clad children who
occasionally accompanied their parents
she had made overtures at first but the
family had one and all scorned them in
their evident opinion she saw her reflection
it was not a pretty reflection
  a smothered sob escaped her no won-
der john had not stooped to bring her back
scene after scene of her married life un-
rolled before her her unreasonable de-
mands johns endless patience his efforts
to make up for the luxuries which he could
not supply at that moment she fairly
ached for the comforting pressure of his em-
brace for his quiet dependability
  ray at the opera ranged himself beside
john in her thoughts ray in full evening
regalia it struck her suddenly that wearing
the right clothes in the right manner seemed
to be his main object in life again a sob
escaped her and the words  what a
contrast 
  she was aroused by the opening of a
door in an agony of terror she raised be-
seeching eyes to the unfriendly face of the
tired nurse who said curtly  its all right
the little girl will get well
   thank-thank you stammered phyl-
lish and then she did something old-fash-
ioned she fainted
  she had to be helped into a taxi half an
hour later but by the time she reached
home her natural resiliency and the knowl-
edge of the childs certain recovery had
brought the color back to her face the
strength to her body
  approaching her fathers study she heard
voices evidently ray had returned with
him she would go in and tell them the
good news she stopped short however
as the name graham came from her fathers
lips
   you see my boy grahams failure is
really due to an action taken by me he
was saying  the shannon company was
his biggest creditor im an important
stockholder besides being a director at

argosy-allstory weekly
my request they close in on him refuse him
any more time the other creditors fall
into line get it
   i suppose it was the only way ap-
proved ray
  phyllis closing her eyes leaned against
the avail outside the door what was this
new calamity what was it they were plot-
ting against john
   her fathers voice came to her harsh de-
cisive  it was he snapped  dont
know whats got into phyllis lately but one
things sure when she sees this newspaper
shell realize that the divorce is the only
way out
  pulling herself together with an effort
phyllis walked into the room and noted
that her unexpected appearance disconcert-
ed both men
   i thought you were in bed hours ago
mumbled smyth
   no i just came from the hospital
what paper are you talking about and why
should i see it
  she picked up the evening paper and
found a small item marked with blue pencil
but outside of john grahams name it con-
veyed little to her
   what does it mean she asked
   it means answered her father chew-
ing at the inevitable cigar  that hes bank-
rupt-broke-bills and no money to pay
although he says hell make good every
dollar
   of course phyllis mechanically
averred  john would do that
  she sat down quietly at the foot of the
long table facing the two men on either
side of it
   its all my fault she stated simply
 i kept nagging him for money and be-
cause he couldnt give it to me i reviled
him and now in some way youve tried
to finish what i started but you cant
she raised her head proudly and looked
straight at her father  john will keep on
fighting hell rise above it all thats
the kind of a man he is
  then her calmness deserted her her
breast heaved convulsively her breath com-
ing sharply from between her quivering lips
 why when i think of the way i treated
him i could die of shame she moaned
   here here railed her father impa-
tiently  this cant affect you to-morrow
youll be a free woman
   free what does that mean im be-
ginning to think it means a clear con-
science
  without waiting for a reply she fled up
to her room and threw herself face down-
ward on the bed conflicting emotions
caused her slender body to shake with sobs
but when the gale had subsided one thought
was dominant in her mind-she must see
john and at once
  on consulting her time-table she found
that she had just an hour to catch the train
and as she hastily packed her suit case
smiles and tears chased each other across
her face at the landing she was con-
fronted by her father furiously chewing at
his cigar
   are you crazy he demanded
 youve got to be here to-morrow to ap-
pear in court
   im afraid the court will have to get
along without me with a tremulous smile
  if you couldnt stand it before how
are you going to now he glared at her
angrily  why he hasnt a dollar to his
name 
   im going to help him
   you-help him
  her fathers derisive laugh stung her to
the quick  help him hes down as far
as he can get-youre going to help him stay
down i suppose
   no im going to be a wife this time-
not a parasite ive been running around
with an apparently solid gold brain but im
cured i think and im going back to
my husband that is humbly  if hell
have me i must hurry or ill miss that
train i wish youd say good-by to me
dad
  but he turned from her without another
word
iv
  the sky was painted with the salmons
and grays of dawn as she alighted from the
train the first thing she did was not to take
a taxi
  going around the back of the house she
let herself in quietly through the kitchen
a daughter of midas

tiptoeing on through the dining room
dreary desolateness and deplorable neglect
pervaded the atmosphere and as she
paused on the threshold of the living room
a little gasp escaped her
  graham his back toward her was poring
over a litter of papers on the library table
and the unutterable weariness in the bent
head would have melted a heart of stone
there was a chill dampness in the air and
ashes were strewn about the dead hearth-
ashes which spoke of many cigars smoked
and an all night session as the sense of
another presence caused him to turn phil-
lis was shocked at the extreme pallor of his
face its emaciation bringing his cheek
bones into startling prominence
   hello phyllis he evinced no sur-
prise but he sat up very straight and his
hand closed spasmodically over the pencil
he was holding then with a smile so ob-
viously forced that it brought tears to her
eyes he continued  rather an early call
youre paying me youve heard and of
course youve come for the rest of your
things
  the simple statement brought a hot flush
of shame to her cheeks  oh no john
she protested  i-
   dont bother explaining i got that
divorce notice and knowing you wished to
be free i didnt file an answer so there
wont be any obstacles in your way you
see how lucky you are to get rid of me
with forced lightness  this cottage must
                                xj
  go and even the despised street cars may
  become a luxury
     he did not look at her but kept his eyes
  glued to a brass bulldog ferociously hold-
  ing down some of the papers on the littered
  table  but to-day at least i can still offer
  you some breakfast ill wash up a little
  and make some coffee
    but phyllis sprang forward blocking his
  way into the dining room  no you
  wont she said with tremulous emphasis
   thats my job and after this im going to
  get the breakfasts
    what graham read in her eyes changed
  his bewildered look to one of radiant hap-
  piness but even while he strained her to
  him he murmured over and over  i
  shouldnt let you do it
     stop me if you can she challenged
  with something of her spoiled child manner
  then after a moment
     and youre not sorry i came back
     sorry if you knew how ive hungered
  for a sight of you
     and you dont think our marriage a
  mistake
     no no but i have so little to offer
  you now dearest
     you have everything that counts and
  im going to try giving as well as taking
  then after a blissfully silent moment
      but theres one thing i wont do john
  she whispered from the shelter of his close
  embrace  i wont ride in street cars-im
  going to walk

   some ancient god overturned it
   after he had taken his fill
   and centuries later we found it-
   our high little round little hill

the three chums
morgan stooped to go through the
low door he found himself in a
small sitting room bedroom and
kitchen from which the soldier vine could
tend his shop aflmost any hour of the day
or night by wheeling himself through the
door and out into his store a low fire
burned in a stove and the teakettle
hummed
  two windows looked out upon a green
little yard with rosebushes in bloom along
a graveled path scarcely a foot in width
which led to a gate in the garden wall
this in turn gave upon an alleyway along
which morgan could see the torsos of people
passing the gate cut off any view of their
lower limbs and the softness of the soil
upon which they walked drowned their foot-
steps so that they seemed like figures float-
ing across a dark screen
  the white curtains at the windows the
green window boxes the high polish of the
stove and the sailorlike cleanness of every-
thing warmed morgans heart it was a
comfortable bunk just the place for an old
soldier to stow himself and even though
crippled spend the rest of his life in a
mellow quiet
  the tobacconist himself was by the stove
washing his dishes they were a cheery
white and blue and he placed them in a
rack as he drew them out of the steaming
water he sat in a wheel chair a rug
thrown across his lap reached to the floor
and concealed his lower limbs
  as he looked up morgan felt a shock he
was chalk faced small eyed and his move-
this story began in the argosy-allstory weekly for november 

the fourth chum

merits were furtive and jerky he dropped
a cup and both he and morgan stooped to
pick it up
  their shoulders touched and in the mo-
ment that they looked into each others
eyes morgan saw cunning fright and a
curious lust in them he stood up and
stepped back a pace those eyes were as
much out of place in this pleasant cozy
room as a tropical spider would have been
the man in the chair began to speak
   wot cheer mate blime if it aint a
gunner from the oss thats my old regi-
ment manys the time ive polished that
round button and fought with a field ar-
tilleryman over it theyre ot because they
wear the flat ones and were ot because
they ave the grenade and we avent wot
can i do for you
   i came down from woolwich said
morgan slowly  to see you
   to see me said the cripple wheeling
himself about in his chair  tyke a chair
and well ave a chat about the old times
wot battery are you from
   p battery
   i was in p once but ive been a sig-
naler so long i feel like i belonged to all
the batteries first youre working with
one and then another when youre a sig-
naler the bloody times ive spread wire
over that practice ground in woolwich
they told me once to cover a gyte with
wire and i covered it that was my first
time in the field problem test and i made
a bloomin ash of it the book said to
cover every gyte with wire meaning to run
a little along the top and leave a little more
for slack but im damned if i didnt run
wire up and down it from top to bottom
and crossways until you couldnt see a bit of
timber ha ha
  all this tumbled out in a rushed mechan-
ical sort of recital punctuated with bursts
of nervous laughter the stuff was good and
true and in it morgan recognized the tone
of the signal school where pearsley had
spent much of his time but pearsley what-
ever his morals might have been in regard
to lost and found property was a big stur-
dy english tommy of victorian mold and
from what little he had heard of him crill
must have been somewhat the same sort
  in his mind morgan had built up a pic-
ture of three men all of this kind and
somehow ennobled by their love for one
another the man before him was of
another sort but after the first shock had
abated morgan remembered that vine had
been terribly wounded and that he had
spent years in hospitals most of which must
have been in pain that would alter any
man although he told himself in the next
moment that he had seen ex-soldiers going
about london as badly crippled as this man
but still cheery healthy and honest in
look
   sit down will yer said the cripple
and pointed to a chair  just knock all
that stuff off on the floor i aint ad time
to clean up proper its a cozy little bunk
when it is done up-it always makes me
think of sergeant russells at the signal
school e was a terror and no mistake
  the voice trailed off for in clearing the
chair morgan had come upon a small
modish black hat he picked it up and
his heart leaped for there was something
about it that reminded him irresistibly of
virginie eloise st alary it was just the
sort of smart expensive looking little tur-
ban she would wear he looked at the
cripple and saw that his face was set in a
leer
   that belongs to my ousekeepers
daughter shes a smart little thing and she
as her eye on being a movie actress that
at ought to get er a job-she looks as
fetching in it as any filly i ever saw wot 
you ave to drink i can give yer whisky or
tea but not much else
   nothing thanks said morgan and
for the sake of the memory laid the hat
carefully on a painted wooden chest  i
have had lunch he added and sat down
in the chair
   its a blawsted good job you ave
when a chap keeps bachelor all the way i
do e dont live very igh i dont see a
femyle fyce or ear a femyle voice from
one years end to the other if its all the
syme to you ill ave a spot of whisky
what cheer
  he brought a bottle up from beside his
chair and poured himself a stiff drink and
downed it when that was done he seemed

argosy-allstory weekly
to relax-he settled himself back in his
chair and the smile on his face became
warmer and more human
  morgan sat pondering the strangeness of
the man and the inconsistency of him for
in one breath he spoke of his housekeepers
daughter and in the second of not seeing a
female face from one years end to the other
still a man caught in an amour would be
more or less bound to make some sort of
excuse
  it was a disappointment not to find vine
of the same mold as pearsley and crill he
cast about in his mind for some proper
means of approaching his mission but the
man in the wheel chair seemed to be crazy
to talk and he went on in his high voice
   is todd still at woolwich
   yes
   e will be until the last trump is
sounded ell be there to devil the last
recruit that joins up manys the time ive
seen im pull a driver off is orse in the
square and bring im flat on the ground
field kit and all e dont coddle em
none
  morgan nodded and smiled he had seen
todd in action and the words fitted the
brigade sergeant-majors methods there
was a step in the outer shop and the faint
click of a latch the man in the chair
stiffened and the face became a shade
whiter
  morgan made as if to rise but the man
shot out a hand and pushed him down into
his chair
  its a customer i think said mor-
gan  i heard a step and the latch of
the door ill go out and see what the man
wants
   no sit where you are ive shut shop
for to-day and its going to stay shut
the man answered in a fierce whisper his
hand clutched the tall soldiers forearm and
both sat in a silence which bad become
suddenly tense there was no repetition of
the footstep however and after a time the
cripple relaxed and fell back into his chair
   i was blown igh as eaven he said
wiping his face with a shaking hand  a
shell blew me thirty feet in the air and
ive never been the syme-inside or out
i ave to ave plenty rest even ere and i
shut up at noon and dont open till four
its the only way i can keep from going
barmy there aint any proper lock on the
door and sometimes people will get in but
i sit ere and let em stand until they get
weary they can clean out the plyce for
all of me i wont move to wait on em
  a twitching movement made the rug
sway that covered his lap and morgan saw
that from the knees down the man was
legless his history was clear and with it
the little creeping doubt in morgans mind
vanished
  vine had been so terribly injured and
shell shocked that it was a wonder he was
alive at all he was but a shell of his former
self and even the impression he gave of
cunning must be excused on the ground of
his terrible injuries the man seemed to
divine his thoughts and began to speak of
his hurts of the many months he had spent
in this hospital and the years in that
when he had finished morgan said  you
heard about pearsley of course
   aye that i did answered the cripple
and dropped his forehead on his hand
 poor old dick e was always planning
that e would pass his last days with crill
and me-the three of us in some little shop
like this wouldnt this ave been the
proper place for three old sods like us
not alf
   with pearsley and crill to run the shop
and me to keep the ouse wed ave been
as appy as clams i was always the and
for cookin when we was on maneuvers
in india they would get the goat or the
jungle cock or whatever else was andy and
i would do the cookin both of em was
good ands at foraging i tell you mate we
ad a system
   and they always thought id be the
first to go west but i didnt i was unlucky
like and it seemed as if when we went out
to france id be the first to get it i was
but wots left of me is alive and both of
them are underground its a bloomin
queer gyme
   you must have been great chums
   we was ever since we was kids to-
gether in the home for soldiers orphans
then we was trumpeters together and arter
that gunners and we fought for each other
the fourth chum

from the time we first began smuggling fags
into our rooms at the ome and blowing the
smoke out of the window arter lights was
out
   we ruled the trumpeters too-the
three of us against any other three or the
ole lot it didnt myke any difference-
they couldnt bust us up its a wonder wot
three kids can cook up and make stick
and if one was punished the other two
would get into some blawsted ole and tyke
the confinement or the stopped pay along
with im dick was always in trouble with
the schoolmaster you mind the school
over by the magazines
   yes
   we went there three days a week for
god knows ow many years crill was al-
ways a lad for is book and i was quick
enough at catching onto the pot ooks but
dick could never tell one letter from an-
other and the sergeant-major that was
schoolteacher was always whaling poor
dick for his dumbness but he never whaled
im that e didnt whale us for sticking pins
into the other lads
   arter wed been gunners for a time
the major told us we could go to signal
school if we could pawss the tests you
ad to figure a bit and write somethink
that the corporal read to you out of a book
and explain somethink in writing-ow to
get to beresford square it was the time we
three took it
   we all three wanted to get into the
school for the reason that the life was
cushy-no guards no stables and two alf
olidays a week everybody wanted to get
into the flags
   but dick couldnt tell ow to get to
beresford square ed been there three
times a week say for ten years and e could
tell a bloke ow to do it or e could draw a
picture but to put it in words was more
than e could get around blime e ate
up is pencil trying to think but he couldnt
do it the figures didnt bother im so
much
   arter the test was over the sergeant
told crill and me that we was all o k
but dick was to go back to the battery
so we told im it was all three or none and
since we was three likely looking soldiers e
let dick tell im ow to get to beresford
square struth i laughed until i was
near crying
  there were tears in the mans eyes when
he finished he dropped his forehead on
his hand and sat still again for a time
   the things us three bloomin tommies
went through he said i mind the
time we first went out to india when we
got aboard we ad to go up a gangplank
that was igh and thin and rickety and it
broke with the three of us on it crill ad
is leg broken and i ad my ankle twisted
but dick wasnt urt they put us to bed
in our proper bunks because the hospital
was full of worse urt than us i mind the
time when dick came in to open the venti-
lator e ad to stand on a little ladder
not two foot off the floor but crill and i
laid there and sweated blood for fear e
would fall
  these scenes moved morgan deeply for
they had a significance in his own life he
forgot the chalky faced ferret eyed man
opposite him and saw only the three young
soldiers chums from babyhood almost
together they had gone through the home
through the rigors of the trumpeters life
through the molding and chipping and
fining that had made the old time british
soldier
  there was no more sacred relation in life
than that of chum to chum and there was
no side of life in which the relation
flourished as it did in the old time british
army this much he knew from observa-
tion and experience low pay and harsh
treatment threw men on each other and all
the pleasure of the old tommys life must
come from the courtesy wit and generosity
of his pal
  the tall young soldier seemed to shrink
and sag as though he had taken on fifty
years his face was white and drawn as he
looked out of the window into the quiet
garden plot and beads of sweat stood out
on his face he wiped them away
   you three had better luck than i did
he said in a voice which became loud and
harsh as he tried to control it  i had a
chum who was as much to me as you and
crill and pearsley were to each other 
killed my pal-boxing

argosy-allstory weekly
   garn  said the man in the chair star-
tled
   yes that is why ive taken so much
interest in you and pearsley pearsley died
in my arms and his last thought was of
you he asked me to bring six diamonds
to you id have gone through hell to put
them in your hands
   no said a low clear voice
  morgans heart leaped then seemed to
pause in his breast and wait for a second
word he knew that low voice with the
thrushlike break in it a slow tremor went
over him and his big hands closed convul-
sively
   wots the trouble mate said the man
in the chair in a ghastly attempt at gayety
  you look like youd seen a ghost
  morgan stared into the cunning wolfish
face it was paper white with dirty
shadings about the eyes and the mouth
  the tall soldier arose and tiptoeing to
the shop door threw it open there was
no one there and he went next to the gar-
den door and threw that open but the little
plot was empty and for the time there was
no one passing beyond the gate he turned
back toward the cripple who was gripping
his chair and raising himself on rigid arms
   sit down chum he said hoarsely
 sit down theres nobody ere but you
and me
  in answer the voice began to sing
          petit mouton ou vas-tu
          je vais-
  the voice stopped suddenly and mor-
gan heard a quick step over his head then
it began again with a note of terror in it
      petit mouton quandre viendras-lu
    jamais jamais jamais
  good lord said morgan youre
not vine
  for answer the cripples arm shot out and
seized a caseknife from the table he
raised himself by his arms and as the rug
fell away morgan saw that his legs were
doubled up under him
  the man put one foot to the floor then
the other and crouched
   and em over he said in a fierce
whisper  and em over
  morgan fell back and put up his hands
the blood was boiling in his breast and his
great muscles twitched but the dread of a
fight was like a lead weight on his spirit
   no he said  no dont make me
strike you 
   and em over
  from above came the clear voice say-
ing no again it ended in a soft
choked scream the ceiling creaked under
the weight of a falling body and at the
sound he straightened his big hands went
out and he took a long step toward the
cripple
   where is she he demanded  tell
me or ill break every bone in you
  one hand fell in a long sweep and caught
the wrist of the knife hand the bones
cracked and the mans lips curled in ag-
ony but he made no sound
   tell me the man went to his knees
biting and scratching at the inexorable grip
then he fell to the floor he had fainted
from the agony of the crushed bones
  morgan left him and whirling ran into
the garden it had appeared to him that
the voice had come from above but there
was no door in the room except the one
which led into the shop and the one which
opened on the garden
  he looked up at the narrow back of the
house and saw a womans handkerchief
fluttering at the sill of a partly opened
window
  he could hear the movement of a body
there and a savage doglike whimper by
standing on a bench he got his finger tips
on the window sill and by setting his foot
on the frame of the garden door he was able
to swing himself up and look in
  she lay near the window face down and
the hair instead of being gray was black
but he knew her for the woman of black-
heath beside her knelt the batman her
warning song had roused the lust in him
as had the opposition of the old soldier of
the coal yard and his answer was the same
so intense was his fury that the smashing
of the window frame did not pierce the
crimson fog that clouded his senses
  morgan knew him and as he raised his
malletlike fist there was no pity none of
the leaden apprehension of hurting a man
the fourth chum

in him the cheek bone cracked as the
fist fell and the batman shot through a
half arc only to meet the other descending
fist he put up his hands uncertainly to
ward off the thunderous blows the soldier
hauled him to his feet and let him stand
for a moment while he gathered his
strength
  under the impact of the blow that struck
against his dark suffused face the batman
rose and sailed like a heavy bird through
the air until he struck the wall there
he fell but morgan would not let him rest
once twice he hauled him to his feet and
struck again then raised him bodily above
his head and hurled him against the wall
the man fell in a confused broken mass
  morgan bent over him fighting for the
control of his runaway muscles they were
crying out to break the batman as a man
is broken on the rack slowly the fever in
him abated and as he saw the curiously
malformed face and the pinpoints of blood
standing out on great patches of bruised
flesh he was suddenly wreak he stood up
blindly then making his way toward the
girl swept her up in his arms and held her
close
  a clock struck a quarter and then the
hour the wild beating of his own heart
had abated and he felt cold and tired but
she still fought her terror tremor after
tremor swept the slim body and the arm
that encircled his neck clung desperately
her other hand was at her bruised throat
the clock struck again and again before
she was calm she slipped out of his arms
to the floor and looked up at him with a
wavering smile
   ah she said in a broken whisper lay-
ing one of her hands on his  i have known
that big han would be of service to me
  morgan got stiffly to his feet and stamped
to set the blood flowing again in his knees
the truth dawned on him that it was all a
plant and that she had been the brains of
it and as a corrollary to all this came the
certainty that she was a soldier of fortune
woman of charm though she might be she
was a criminal but she had warned him
  she seemed to read his frowning scrutiny
and spread out her hands a slow flush
crept into her cheek and her eves left his
   it has been very badly manage she
said in a stronger voice  when he drop
the cup i know it cannot go sir you will
have no respec for me you will laugh at
me as long as you live
   he shook his head
    no mademoiselle i can never laugh at
you
    and my hat she said ruefully  which
you foun on the chair never before have
i made such a blunder i have call myself
many hard names as i sit here and listen
to you talking below such a willing sheep
and such a clumsy shearer it is a sad
waste
   but you warned me said morgan
 why
   how do i know- perhaps i have los
my nerve perhaps i do not like it because
it is so easy an actor sir does not value
an audience that is too easily move and
perhaps you have so touch me with your
story that i cannot bear to see you hood-
wink perhaps but no it is leaving
the hat on the chair that has disgus me
with it all things so badly begun cannot
turn out well sooner or later i should have
trouble-
  a stertorous breath from the batman cut
her short her eyes closed and her hands
flew to her throat morgan stooped and
touched her after a moment she opened
her eyes and looked up at him with the
wavering smile
    you will forgive me she said  it is
not customary that people try to-kill me
ah such a bad dream
  morgan went to the batman he was
breathing thickly through puffed lips
  morgan straightened him out suddenly
happy that the man was not dead and in
looking about for something with which
to bind him got his first glimpse of the
room it was a small dowdy chamber with
bed dresser chairs and washstand at the
foot of the bed was an automobile trunk
and he took the straps off it to bind his
prisoner it was initialed on the end-
v e st a
    i have live here said the woman who
was watching his movements until they took
him so close to the batman that she must
see him  since yesterday at noon it is

argosy-allstory weekly
a furnish lodging here i have made my
plan and here i have listen for hours to
tales of the army then when i hear one
that is about chums that brings the tear
to my own eye i say boh use that
he will like that it was a good plan still
it could not succeed
   vine is travel to london and will not
be back until we have the stones and are
well away but that man below i have
not like his face from the first and sir
i think you did not either he is a beggar
who sits with his legs doubled up-a white-
chapel beggar
  i have been in favor of a soldier a real
soldier who is out of work and who will
do it for ten pounds but no i am
overrule and we mus have a crafty man
one who will know how to whine an not to
fall into traps
   we said morgan when she had fin-
ished  mademoiselle what are you
  she laughed her delicious low chuckle
but the delicate color flushed her face
   years ago she answered  i have
hear a man in a music hall ask  why is a
cow the people have shriek with laugh-
ter answer me that sir and i will answer
you
  he looked down at her soberly for she
had touched him as no other woman had
ever done indeed she had touched him
as no other person outside his chum had
ever done
  his life had changed when he walked
with her on blackheath the melancholy
which had sapped him had lifted to a de-
gree and he had felt within himself the
low stirrings of his old self the ghostly
hands of a life which he had thought dead
were plucking at him he saw in a flashlike
vision the tall elms of his college campus
heard voices singing even now that was
where he belonged
  the woman got to her feet and he put
out a hand to steady her she held up a
finger solemnly and the haunting smile
curved her lips
   you will remember this of me she said
in a voice in which the mocking quality
did not hide a strain of earnestness  that
there are good souls doing bad things and
bad souls doing good things i mean there
are people who have live inside the law
all their life inside every law yet they are
not good souls and there are people who
have broken all the law yet they are good
souls
   whenever you think of virginie st
alary you will think that too and now
sir i hear people in the garden will you
please to look and tell me who it is
there were two men in the garden both
looking up at the back of the house and
at the gate was a blue uniformed and
helmeted member of the constabulary
   quickly said the girl with a stamp of
her foot
   one is tall said morgan  he has
big brown eyes and he wears a gray bowler
hat and a checked overcoat
   and the other
   same height said morgan  he has
a pale blue eye and a red face and a thin
sandy mustache he wears a gray tweed
suit and there is one thing i can tell you
about him mademoiselle he loves cricket
 how do you know
   he was in the same compartment with
me coming down on the train he got out
a few miles from winchester and rode off
in a trap with a policeman
   ah  she said morgan turned and saw
that she was pale and that she pressed one
hand against her lips he went to her
and putting his hands on her shoulders
spoke earnestly
   who is he mademoiselle tell me it
may be that i can help you
   he is cartiers man she said
   cartier the great jeweler
   yes it is his man crissey i will tell
you he is the one most fear by all for he
has the police of every country at his finger
tips until now i have never met him face
to face but often we have brush shoulders
in the dark as it were he will be very glad
to see me 
  morgan could feel her trembling under
his hands
   whys he here he asked  on ac-
count of pearsleys diamonds
   yes-he is here for the same reason
that we are all here but he will try to do
other business perhaps he will arrest us
and i am sure he will make me trv to tell
                         	a
the fourth chum

he is a very cunning man and in his work
he has no pity sir it is for me very des-
perate
  third degree stuff he said backing
away from her the blood boiled in him
whatever virginie st alary might be she
was by far the most lovely woman he had
ever seen and the thought of a heavy
handed policeman catching her and pinning
her as if she were a moth angered him un-
controllably he forgot vine he forgot
his promise to pearsley for the time he was
a crook fighting for the head of his gang
   mademoiselle he said  i am with
you-body and soul
  she stared at him out of heavy eyes
   you mean you will fight for me
   yes and i hold the trump
   ah she breathed as a flash of light
went across her face  the stones of which
we are all so weary you mean you will not
give them to him
  no a thousand times no
  the change in her was galvanic in its
suddenness she straightened and was sud-
denly full of vibrant life the gray eyes
glowed and the color flooded richly into her
face
   twice she said  you have save my
life-and now you have done a greater
thing sir for you have savemy self-respec
it would be a sad thing for me to fail as a
workman and a woman too but now that
i have succeed as woman i have a hope
that i shall succeed as workman
   we must go below for i have learn
that to defen ones self against danger it
is best to go to meet danger you mus
put those stones from you if you have them
on you you will be search i am sure
you must say no more than is necessary
    i have no idea what it is i shall do but
i think pauline laboulaye is not done yet 
chapter xi
hampstead wins
morgan was the last to enter the
room crissey sat on the edge of the
table swinging his leg wales was in
a chair by the stove and the girl stood in
the window she had put on the small
 a
black hat and a coat lay over her arm it
was an admirable effect she seemed to be
just on the point of leaving in a motor
after calling on a dependent on some sweet
errand of mercy her eyes were lowered
and her face almost completely in the
shadow
  on closer examination morgan could
scarcely feel that crissey was the formidable
man the girl had thought him to be he
turned out to be thinner and more nervous
looking with his top coat off his shoulders
sloped so sharply that his coat sagged a
half inch away from his collar and his
favorite gesture was a hitch which tried to
remedy the defect a pair of gold rimmed
spectacles the hooks of which did not quite
fit his ears gave him an old womanish look
  when they were all before him he ap-
peared at a loss for an opening morgan
seated himself on a chest linked his hands
across his knees and waited crissey stared
as he entered and nodded he spoke al-
most apologetically and addressed himself
to morgan
   here we all are pauline laboulaye
jimmy wales alias frank morton alias
jerry hoke alias howard dicey-
   you havent forgotten some have
you asked wales in a nettled tone and
the detective answered almost humbly i
havent mentioned three-but they were
names you worked under in america you
soldier i met on the train but i didnt have
the pleasure of hearing your name
   morgan gunner patrick morgan
r h a regimental number two hundred
and eighty-two thousand six hundred and
sixty-six here is my pass if you care to
see it and my number is stamped on my
boot tops on my cap band on my-
   thats enough answered crissey
 quite you didnt go on to southampton
 no
   i remember now you spoke of stopping
off at winchester to see a crippled old sol-
dier who ran a tobacco shop you must
have been a trifle surprised at the people
who were keeping your shop what
morgan maintained a stony silence the
batman was a lesser trump-he was a mur-
derer one intensely wanted by the army
and it must redound greatly to this mans

benefit to get him morgan was planning
to turn him over at the proper moment and
it was on the tip of his tongue to speak
then but he thought it best to wait in-
stead he kept a non-committal silence and
nodded
   winchester is a lovely place went on
crissey  where else would you get pop-
lars and old gray walls and a little garden
like this one you ought to see the ca-
thedral too repairing it and restoring it
was one of the great engineering tasks
for the first time he said impressively
 in the history of ecclesiastical architecture
a diver was employed in repairing the foun-
dation
   im a bit interested in brasses too and
there must have been some fine ones on
the floor there-you can see the outline
where they were sunk into the stone gone
gone in the time of the reformation with
most of the worlds best glass pauline
where did you get that bruise
   ah sir she answered startled out of
the abstraction into which his soft monoto-
nous voice had thrown her  i have-
her tongue faltered and a red flush of
shame climbed into her cheek she glanced
at morgan and at wales and then looked
down morgan was shocked-she seemed
so faltering and nonplused
   is he upstairs asked crissey and the
girl nodded
   oh tom called crissey into the gar-
den  take two men upstairs and get that
soldier chap whos wanted at woolwich
will you i fancy hell need first aid yes
he finished turning back  winchester is
a lovely place jolly historical too they
have a leather jack in the college which
holds about two gallons for eight cen-
turies-eight centures mind you-that jack
has been brought into the dining hall full
of ale for the young men eight centuries
   i suppose canterbury is a bit older still
thirteen centuries i think is the age of
canterbury school thirteen continuous
centuries of education my word it speaks
for the solidity of england
   for gods sake what do you want
asked wales in a hoarse voice crissey
whirled on him surprised apparently by
the tension in his voice
   im just a plain con man said wales
 one step up from a yegg and not a very
tall step either i always did hate these
private dicks you never know where to
find em and you never know what theyre
going to do once they find you give me a
copper every time who has a locust in his
hand and the black maria around the cor-
ner they dont kill you with suspense
anyhow
   you will see that my frien is a very
very nervous man said the woman  it
is not kindness so to treat him soon i
expect he shall need to go to a rest cure and
sit in a chair and have a nurse
  it was a rebuke morgan saw to wales
and it worked the cool voice seemed to
bring back his self-control he stirred in his
chair reddened and muttered an inarticu-
late answer crissey turned to her when she
spoke as a somewhat deaf person turns to
people taking part in a general conversation
  morgan found that his hands were cold
one trump was gone and there was some-
thing in the personality of crissey that
seemed to take away ones powers of falsi-
fying he knew the time would come when
he himself should be questioned and he
went cold at the thought of it
   speaking of rest cures said crissey
 i saw a friend of yours a few weeks
ago pauline louette anisterre i know
she was not exactly a friend-you saw her
only three times to my knowledge but you
know how it is-you always think that girls
of the same age are friends
   lets see he said closing his eyes and
putting his forefinger on his lips  you are
about the same age i think yes but shes
the older by three months she was bom
in january-and you were born in april
its a beastly custom the french have of
cutting off a womans hair when she enters
prison its bad enough for a convent-
shed been washing something in lye water
too and her hands were swollen and knotted
and red-i keep track of my patients-and
she wanted to see me asked me to do a
kindness for her
   she has a boy with some friends a
little chap of two or so and she was look-
ing ahead to the time when he should go
into the army she earns a few sous a week
the fourth chum

in the prison and she wants them put away
at interest at the time when the boy is of
military age he will have a little money for
comforts it was a jolly unpleasant task
i can tell you talking to her-
  crissey wiped his glasses morgans knee
slipped from his hands and his foot struck
the floor with a thump that made them all
jump his heart was like ice and when
he looked at wales he could see that that
man had his eyes on the girl and was trem-
bling like a wet dog
  crissey had drawn a picture of louette
anisterre but in his mind and in the minds
of his listeners was the picture of virginie
st alary in the same prison with her hair
cut off and her hands swollen with iye
water of them all she was the one most
quiet her face had gone white but her
voice was cool and steady as she said  you
cannot frighten me sir i am no child to
be scared by bogy men
   i suppose we all began at the same
point went on crissey more cheerfully
 and with about the same amount of in-
formation i suppose you found that vine
was pearsleys old chum and would try
to get the stones down here some way or
other by the way i have seen the mar-
quise de perthuis in her old chateau she
showed me the tile under which the stones
had been hidden and from under which
pearsley evidently took them like all
frenchwomen she is brave
   i take it that you rigged a plant for the
messenger-or it may be that the stones
are here when you get here then you fall
out somehow or other with the little swine
that wales picked up at the red lion and
he tries to murder pauline wales youre
a rotten judge of men-rotten then this
big soldier blunders in here on his leave and
saves pauline
   am i right no probably not i
am usually wrong when i let my imagina-
tion get the better of me but let me tell
you this he said shaking his finger like a
schoolmistress  i know that clure wasnt
in on this if clure had had it under his
direction-good god you ought to think
of clure once every day wales and then
walk to jerusalem on your knees if i could
lay my finger on that man-ah
  he took a long breath and sank back to
his seat on the table wales moved for-
ward in his chair and wet his lips
   look here chief he said im a
yegg as i told you this stuff about honor
among thieves dont go very far with me
im out to save my own bacon-and hers
if i put you onto clure if i tell you now
where you can lay your hands on him if
i give you the low-down on some jobs that
he pulled that are still puzzling the dicks
will you let us go will you
  crissey pushed his glasses farther up on
his nose and stared at wales morgan
caught a curious glance that wales flashed
toward the girl a pleading apologetic agon-
ized ook
   why i dont know said crissey un-
certainly  this is extraordinary very un-
usual it would make a difference-natu-
rally i have to have information to work
on and  have to get it where i can and
unfortunately how i can what can you
tell me about clure i give you my word
that if it is of value-
   he can give you nothing of value said
the girl in a low clear voice  sir my hus-
band is dead
  she trembled and pressed the back of her
hand against her lips morgan hanging on
every word as if it were the most thrilling
play he had ever seen felt a dull shock
run through him first of surprise then of
pity for there was no pretense in the tre-
mendous grief which she was fighting cris-
sey watched her for a moment then again
wiped his glasses
   that was cricket pauline he said
huskily  dead what a pity he was a
god in looks and in his abilities he was
too great for this life-he could live to his
height only in some great crisis such as war
furnished and when there was no war he
turned to crime and you will forgive me
if i ask how he died
   he was kill in an accident she an-
swered her voice sunk to its lowest and
most thrilling depth  a street accident
ah sir it is one of the puzzles of this life
why a man who have live through the air
as he have live should die from a cab
   it is it is getting up he walked
across the room and back briskly

   i mustnt forget what im here for i
always make it a rule to be rather severe
just after something has moved me of
course that puts a different face on things
with clure gone you are both about as
harmful as bees with their stings drawn
you can buzz but tell me honestly has
either of you had any luck with him gone
 my god no said wales
   and you pauline
  alas no
   you wont have youre like napo-
leons marshal after he went wales my
boy drive a taxi pauline go back to your
ivory carving-you will do something with
it if you work and remember all women
need a manager and the more clever and
more beautiful they are the more need they
have of one you french girls come along
too fast when you came out of the con-
vent at fifteen you knew more than my
grandmother did at ninety
   yes she said with a flash of spirit
 and you who are the all seeing eye of the
bon dieu i have a commission for you
every month some one have sent me twenty
guineas yet never have i been able to fin
out who it is that does it
   as i listen to you i say to myself
 ah pauline it is the oracle he can tell
what makes the rivers run and the moon
to turn and why this year dresses are long
and the next they are short perhaps you
can tell me who it is that sends me twenty
guineas every month
   twenty guineas said crissey  no
i dont know and i take it very unkind of
you to rag me this way god knows ive
worked hard enough-ive had every man i
could lay my hands on laboring like beav-
ers on this business from the old general at
woolwich down and now soldier i think
i will take the stones if you are ready
morgan got to his feet and looked at the
girl it should have been a carefully guard-
ed significant glance a communication con-
fined to the two of them instead it was an
open-mouthed blundering question which
any one could read who cared to she nod-
ded and spread out her hands in an eloquent
gesture and he strode back into the shop
crissey followed him and closed the door
the
  on the counter was a small mountain of
black shag tobacco and into it as he passed
it on his way into the back room morgan
had plunged the perthuis diamonds he
retrieved them now and gave them to cris-
sey who put them into a vest pocket and
buttoned his coat over it
   youre a queer chap he said in a
friendly voice  to be in the army-our
army its a lark isnt it
   yes said morgan and heaved a sigh
a big sigh that relieved not only the op-
pression of the moment but of the last two
years  im going home within the year
my time will be out
   i used to think i wanted to go to your
country and be a cowboy said crissey in
the same friendly voice  and i suppose
you feel the same-especially after kipling
i understand hes even more popular in the
states than here i say youll be about
london for a year then wont you
   yes
   keep your eye on that girl as a favor
to me shes-shes a rainbow if you know
what i mean shell do something some day
if she works she fell across clures path
just as she came out of the convent and
she thinks now shes a great crook she
isnt-and if she has some one to-to boss
her a bit if you get what i mean shell go
straight
   just between you and me he finished
sinking his voice to a whisper  clure
wasnt the great man she thinks him he
wasnt killed by a cab-thats a story some-
body told her to cover up his death he
killed himself because he was cornered-
by me and ive been sending her that
twenty guineas a month
  he looked at morgan and nodded slowly
to drive his points home a policeman
tapped at the door and crissey opened it
to receive the newspaper which the man
thrust within
   going back to america he said in a
louder voice as he turned the pages to
the sporting sheet  its a good thing-
a man does best in his own country-what
i mean is he does his best work his
face brightened as he read
 i say hampsteads won again

an assorted variety of liquor sodden
beach combers decorated the unin-
k viting portals of the hawse pipe
they lent a vast amount of local color by
their varying attitudes and altitudes of
drunkenness and sprawling positions a
rickety covering of boards protected them
from the white hot rays of the sun a row
of empty whisky kegs held a promise to
thirst parched throats
  leaning against the rough boards that
formed the wall were two men mike
and john slagin proprietors of the dive and
den the hawse pipe they were by far the
most uninviting objects in sight mike was
dozing in a chair his legs drawn up like a
grasshopper poised for a record breaking
leap his face was long and thin his nose
had been set aside deftly by a flying whisky
bottle and had since followed the new di-
rection with astonishing faithfulness his
eyes were set close together necessarily be-
cause of the hatchet-thin head his ears
were large hanging downward by their
sheer weight his brother and twin-john
slagin-was a second edition of mike both
in character and bodily resemblance ex-
cept for the nose which john had managed
to protect he was mike slagin in another
body both however retained their twinly
qualities as to reputation
  the hawse pipe itself squatted like a
huge toad on the water front of port reso-
lution in the new hebrides its mission
in life governed by the twins was to dis-
pense evil tasting drinks to careless sailor-
men sailormen-those who were sailormen
-did not hesitate to leave the pest hole be-
hind those who were unfortunate enough
to linger were promptly shanghaied by the
slagins on the first ship requiring their ser-
vices collecting in return a fee hence real
sailors were scarce the beach combers and
wine legs enjoyed a peaceful amnesty-a
perpetual armistice with the slagins no
skipper would take them and even that
pair of vultures mike and john slagin tired
of foisting them off for seamen
  at present port resolute was suffering a
scarcity of sailors

argosy-allstory weekly
  the skipper of the schooner paddy boy
had just placed an order for two deck hands
at fifty dollars apiece as soon as they were
placed aboard his vessel
   an remember he said warningly-
 remember none o yer shenanigans i
know every bamboo white man in this cor-
ner o hell so dont try an send me none
o this ballast-none o these human whisky
bottles if you do-ill break yer necks
with that he stalked out
  mike smiled-a smile he meant to be
symbolical of his inherent honesty his nose
distorted it into a grin that suggested the
snarl of a hyena
  mike cast a calculating eye over the as-
sembled beach combers each specimen of
manhood was a living example-a living
threat of a broken neck as a reward instead
of fifty dollars hardly had the brothers
assimilated the order than jack mullen and
his partner percy arrived
   wheres that pair o half witted con-
victs mullen roared glaring around
out of the group of lounging men mike and
john slagin came forward sullenly
   i want two new men the last two
disappeared two days ago he glared sus-
piciously at the brothers
  jack mullen was of medium size tough
stringy and ornery he habitually glared
ferociously at every one his neck was
knobbed with an enormous adams apple
that worked rapidly when he grew angry
his jowls were hung with folds of tough
hairy skin and his nose was long and pro-
nounced his speech was fiery his temper
worse and his fists faster and more deadly
than both combined in direct contrast was
his partner percy half owner of the trim
schooner burweed he was small wizen
and runty his thin stooped shoulders were
topped by an enormous head superimposed
on his shiny bald pate was a cap many sizes
too small for him beneath the thin sparse
eyebrows were two watery orbs faded a
pale azure
  he hopped from foot to foot gnawed at
his fingers and generally exhibited the
symptoms of advanced insanity his small
body seemed driven by some enormous
dynamo of energy that found an outlet
only in his nervous pacings and gestures
  clearly distinct from the odors of the
dive was the scent of costly french per-
fume it stained percys shirt front in large
concentric circles his remaining character-
istic was his tremendous sense of vanity
  his speech was halting stuttering he
stumbled and fumbled when any one ad-
dressed him if the anomaly can be more
complete he was born on the north side
of san francisco the north side of frisco
is to frisco as the gas house district is to
new york
   now looka here mullen said shak-
ing his finger at the slagin twins- we
want two sailors we dont care how ye get
em nor who ye get-only get em an
none o yer didoes either if ye send any
o this dunnage out yell do well to slip
yer cable an drift away he indicated
the group of loafers as the unwanted dun-
nage
   sure mike rejoined placatingly
 sure capn mullen ye know us bettern
that
  aye answered mullen with convic-
tion  that i do an a more unprinci-
pled pair o blaguards never lived 
  frankness was one of mullens outstand-
ing points a spade was a spade and a
slagin a crook the slagins were not in the
least offended by mullens truthfulness it
was first rate advertising
  mullen went inside out of the sun and
sat down at a table percy followed meek-
ly and sat at his left when mullen ordered
 smoke percy meekly asked for soda
water
  mullen coming ashore with the avowed
intention of getting drunk was fast ap-
proaching the state wherein missing sailor -
men had no call and was doing his best to
sponge percy of his sin of teetotalism
ii
  the slagin twins were as nearly frantic
as flea brained human beings can be here
was a perfect demand and no visible sup-
ply mike by a superhuman mental effort
had managed to make a sum total of the
receipts for the day providing the orders
were filled the sight of the lounging beach
combers tempted him they had been
shanghaied furies

shanghaied so often and mauled so much in
the process of shuttling back and forth be-
tween the ships and the hawse pipe that he
had lost heart of ever disposing of them
  john had visited every nook and corner
in the town where he might reasonably or
unreasonably be expected to find a seaman
the only available members of the frater-
nity were two distressed mariners nursing
a perfect collection of solomon island sores
commonly called yaws he had cherished a
thought that perhaps they might be reno-
vated when withdrawn from the thatched
hut into which they had crept and into the
broad light of day they disgusted even that
hardened wretch and his sense of gain the
two sailors resembled nothing so much as
a pair of moth-eaten feather dusters age old
and useless
  he returned to the hawse pipe and
found his brother mike in the act of rolling
a drunk for the change which mike had
found impossible to annex before the man
lost consciousness it jarred johns ethics-
this slot machine thievery
   mike knock that off heres some real
money come here john pulled him aside
and in a back room delivered his message
not a sailor had he been able to find he
suggested shanghaiing a couple of native
women and putting pants on them mike
however was more cautious better give
mullen a couple of beach combers than
that it would be infinitely more healthy
were they ever caught mikes hide and
its condition of health was the only thing
mike cared for he took excellent care that
it didnt decorate any ones bam door-
johns included mike played in johns
back yard simply because there was no one
else who would trust him and because john
was the only one who had the foresight and
hindsight necessary to keep a check on his
brother
  no matter how quickly mike moved nor
how fast the toboggan of their morals
dropped john was there on deck
   john mike said suddenly almost
knocked full length by the thought that
struck him  spose-spose- mike was
not given to thinking consequently when
his mind did not function it left him in a
sort of a temporary daze it was a kind of
mental flipflop  john spose we fix the
skipper o the paddy boy up theres that
that old duck of a mullen in there and his
sissy partner give em a knockout drop
an a sleigh ride then put em aboard the
paddy boy shell sail an well be a
hundred dollars ahead listen-i got an
idee
  he bent forward and whispered into
johns ear john shook his head mike
repeated the whisper with verbal garnish-
ment john heretofore cold smiled
grinned and then laughed he waxed
warm with the idea clapping mike on the
back they chuckled at this clever piece
of close business oh they were clever
yes they were
   edication bah mike said we
dont need it we wtuz born clever heres
where were so dumb were smart
  when the plan was as complete as their
minds could make it they shook hands
the heavenly twins were thumbing their
much battered noses at providence
iii
  in due time mike had mixed the drinks
-one for each of them-and turned his
back on the tray holding the whisky john
took the drink mike had prepared for him-
self and gave mike his own johns hind-
sight was working smoothly
  later mullen was under the table and
the frame of his partner percy was draped
carelessly over his chair like a rag doll
with a caution that marked him as a lesser
napoleon john before the knockout drops
had taken effect had reminded percy that
they the twins would see them to their
ship should the necessity arise that was
to be one of the main threads of the de-
fense should the half witted brain child
of mikes ever turn on them as it was apt
to do soon the two conspirators could be
seen carrying the inert forms of mullen
and his partner percy toward the water
front
  they explained to inquisitive passers-by
that the partners had partaken of whisky
in  large doses and that they-the slagin
twins in the full bloom of civic pride-
could hardly be expected to see the much

argosy-allstory weekly
splattered escutcheon of port resolute fur-
ther defiled
   dont fergit john mike warned
 that big idee o mine taint every day
a chanst comes like this
  john wasnt likely to that  idee 
represented a bulwark all that stood be-
tween him and the fiery furnace-a sort of
reprieve from his specially allotted reserved
corner of hell
   i aint gonna john said  our edi-
cation might a been neglected but boy
we aint showin it none
  then the twins wandered from the path
of safety instead of taking the recumbent
forms to their own schooner the burweed
but a little way down the dock they hired
a boatman and pulled out to the paddy
boy anchored in the stream
  when they dumped their unconscious
burdens on the deck they held out their
palms to the mate
   wait a minute he said cautiously
 i aint buying a pig in a poke whats
this-a coupla noahs deck hands
   better take what ye kin get mike
said  theys the only sailors in the
town
   from our own garden john added
with a grin
   whats wrong with em the mate
queried  are ye sure theyre alive
  the mate had in mind a specific incident
wherein the slagins had disposed of a dead
chinaman under similar conditions collect-
ing in return good legal tender
   wait  they wakes up mike grinned
  the mate paid over the hundred dollars
and escorted the pair back to the gangway
a wary eye peeled for possible straying fin-
gers the twins left much satisfied al-
though the market remained still unsatis-
fied they were content to rest on their
laurels
iv
  for the first time in percys life he ex-
perienced the rocky awakening so closely
associated with scotch whisky in large
quantities the mate of the paddy boy
had dumped them into the forecastle mul-
len was snoring contentedly a few feet
away percy sat erect clutching his head
a mystified gaze about him awakened no
familiarity with surroundings he staggered
to his feet shook mullen violently and
getting no response made his way to the
deck
  out of the corner of his eye he saw the
aggressive mate start toward him
   well whatta you think youre gonna
do he demanded truculently  get back
in that focsle
   but-but- stammered percy  this
isnt my ship somethings wrong here
have we been shanghaied he questioned
 im mullens partner were owners of
the schooner burweed how-how did we
-we get here
   you were carried here me bucko
down ye go if ye cant remember signing
articles ye shouldnt drink bad liquor
   but-but-we didnt sign articles
percy quavered  we were shanghaied
thats jack mullen down there and im-
im his partner there -he pointed to
the burweed a hundred yards distant-
 there is our vessel
   dye know any more funny jokes
the mate asked sarcastically  if ye do
ye better tell em to yer pal down there
shut up  he roared when percy interrupted
him  stow yer jawin tackle i just paid
a hundred good american bucks fer you
two birds
   but- percy edged toward the side
 no ye dont the mate snapped and
dived for percys legs percy leaped clear
the mate rose and swung an enormous fist
at him percy chattered for peace he
avoided the insane rushes he led the mate
a race around the decks pleading for es-
cape when he found that talking was
useless he whirled about and leaped into
the air one foot flashed out-and patted
the mate on the nose before he could leap
again the mate had punished the little man
with a bony fist in a blow that shook percy
to his heels he staggered clear waiting
for the daze to work itself off and circled
again around the deck then when his
brain had partially recovered he turned
on his tormentor and fought
  the mate disappeared beneath the ava-
lanche of flashing feet percy was over him
beneath him on both sides of him behind
shanghaied furies

him and always those feet were prodding
the mate into insensibility when he
stopped it was solely to pant for breath
  then percy went forward seized the still
insensible form of mullen and began drag-
ging him aft to the gangway he hailed a
boat that was passing and dumped the in-
ert form of mullen into it cast off and
headed for the burweed
  arriving at the schooner he had his
crew hoist the unconscious mullen aboard
they did it in a matter-of-fact way hoist-
ing mullen aboard was a matter of routine
sometimes they did it in a bosun chair
sometimes in a cargo net
  percy hesitated only long enough to erase
the signs of the struggle then went ashore
he headed straight toward the hawse pipe
ignoring the gibes sailortown flung at him
their shanghaiing had already become
common gossip
  when percy arrived he found two incred-
ulous crimps awaiting him
   i think we was shanghaied percy be-
gan  we woke up on the paddy boy
you said you would take us-to the bur-
weed the mate-tried to make us stay
aboard every one is laughing-at us
he gulped down the remaining words as a
small boy might on the verge of tears  i
got-to have an explanation
   sho  mike gasped  do tell well
whadda ye know about that we must a
picked the wrong ship we cant read
   but-but- the little man gasped-
 couldnt you see the name paddy boy
had two words in it-and-the burweed-
only one
   naw mike snarled  i tell ye we
cant read then his injured pride gained
the upper hand  we takes ye out an then
ye says ye was shanghaied
   but the mate says he gave you a hun-
dred dollars percy went on pulling on his
fingers nervously  i-think youre-
telling an untruth it was unfair-of you
john shook with mirth  aw gwan
little boy didnt me brudder just say we
cant read if ye dont believe it ask any
one how dye expect us to make out the
name on the ship we got all we can do to
sign our names didja expect us to refuse
the money we thought it was a gift
  for the first time in johns fantastic ex-
istence he had uttered the truth they
could not read but a missionary had pa-
tiently taught them to write their names
that was the extent of their education
  percy could appeal to the commissioner
if he chose but he knew that the twins
ruse would carry them through they could
swear they thought they were taking them
to the burweed and were innocent of any
wrong as he stumbled his way back to
the paddy boy he could hear the gibes
flung at him all sailortown knew that
jack mullen and his partner had been
shanghaied all sailortown laughed and
wheezed with mirth
  babes in the wood they howled at
percy  go get yer mamma 
  percy found mullen on deck his adams
apple was performing spasmodically his
eyes flashed and he choked with suppressed
wrath percy explained that the slagins
couldnt read
  mullen cried bah percy suggested
that they think it over mullen snarled
 i did i thought it all over in one sec-
ond ill wring his neck ill nail his car-
cass on my fore truck for the crows to pick
that dirty pair of blackbirds
  when he landed on the dock he heard the
gibes directed at them it was like a quick
match to a powder magazine the disgrace
was more than mullen could bear his soul
was struggling for vindication and nothing
but blood would wipe out the stain he
jack mullen twenty years in the south
seas to be shanghaied like a cabin boy
he would wreck the joint shanghai him
would they well they had a buzzsaw by
the tail
  mullen was almost running with percy
hopping along pleading with his partner
to stop he prayed ordered commanded
and still mullen strode on he had grasped
his pistol by the muzzle intent on braining
the twins
  percy was frantic  please jack heave
to wait-wait i got a plan stop
he was scared
  the angry mullen would have nothing
short of their scalps  go way percy
he snarled  this is my turn go way
an stop botherin me-or ill scuttle you

argosy-allstory weekly
   wait-jack-the bible says  the
meek - meek shall-inherit-inherit-the
earth stop
   who the hell wants the earth mullen
threw over his shoulder  with a coupla
coyotes like that on it
  percy continued to plead pullingon mul-
lens coat tails his voice was threatening
to break his shirt tail stuck out of his
trousers-he had lost his hat and his mind
was in chaos he must stop this madman
he would murder those two ruffians he
was about to give up when he saw port
resolutions sole keeper of the law and
the jail
  deliberately he waited until they came
abreast of the officer-deliberately he an-
gered mullen the more-deliberately he
hurled the last back-breaking soul-shaking
barb
   you big cheese you cant handle yer
liquor you big drunken bum mike 
beat yer head off percy shrieked and he
danced up and down in defiance
  this insult referred to mullens lack of
capacity for alcoholic drink was deep and
deadly
   what mullen roared stopping
 you little runt you little sawed-off hunk
o nothin you mean to say that that
skunk  lick me dye mean to insinuate
that  cant carry my liquor
   yes percy shrieked again shaking his
puny fist yes you big irish mick
  then mullen hit him for the first time
in all their career they quarreled the
officer advanced on mullen percy grabbed
the gun and yelled hysterically  he hit
me he hit me arrest him officer lock
him up over and over tumbled the irate
mullen percy clutched the pistol and
after a short battle mullen was led away
by the constable the tussle had drawn a
crowd
  ill git that little runt too mullen
roared back at them some of the specta-
tors warned percy to disappear  hell
git you little feller better make knots out
o here
  percy stood aghast at his own audacity
   do you-you think-think so he
quavered reaction robbing him of his
strength
  the news that mullen and his partner
had quarreled spread all over town they
were known as fast friends by every one
and the split came as a thunderbolt sev-
eral minutes after it had happened mike
and john slagin were breathing easier
they grew solicitous for percys aid the
little chap had wandered about forlorn
saddened-greeted everywhere by the warn-
ing to  drift at last seeking companion-
ship of any sort he had gone to the hawse
pipe
  john asked him sarcastically  wheres
yer knittin ole lady i hears yer got a
bust in the jaw from yer pal didnt crip-
ple im did ye
  percy dropped into a chair tired as if
from long running he pulled at his nose
moved his feet nervously and at last an-
swered  jack says hell kill me and he
will im-im afraid i gotta go soon-
before he gets out he finished helplessly
   yep mike said judicially  hell prob-
ably kill you like a worm now theres
the paddy boy goin to fiji to-night
   but-but-my schooner share-what 
i do with that percy trembled with fear
 i cant give im that what  i-i-
do he was wringing his hands  its
worth-five-five thousand dollars its all
i-i-got the little old man was gulp-
ing back the tears wholl buy my half
from me he demanded chokingly
  mike looked at his brother another
brain child that showed all the humanity
of a snake and all the appearance of a
hyena they drew apart leaving percy
with his wreck of friendship to suffer alone
  they talked and whispered and argued
at last reached a decision and came forward
again
   ye know yere in trouble mike began
 an moneys scarce he seemed to con-
descend in his bargaining  but men me
brudder  take yer share o the schooner
offen yer hands the best we kin do is five
hundred dollars he finished with a wave
of his hand that was meant to impress
percy with his munificence
   but-its worth five thousand-not-
not counting the-cargo percy chattered
 i oughta have-more than that
  mullens partner was fidgetting casting
shanghaied furies

quick glances at the jail behind him john
shook his head in a negative to mike and
whispered in his ear  put the screws on
im well freeze mullen out in a week
   dont fergit mike paused impres-
sively  they might let mullen out to-
night you gotta be out o this place
afore then five hundred dollars is all ill
pay mike still had the sledge hammer
up his sleeve when percy wavered he
brought it out
   i guess i better go down an bail mul-
len out come on john mullen  give
us a hundred fer interest anyhow
  he started away followed by john
slagin
  wait-wait percy almost shrieked
 ill take-take it when the two came
back percy was almost groveling on his
knees
   ive got a little-stake stowed away-
from some pearls-maybe that  be enough
to get away with he rambled on  dont
bail mullen out till i get away please
he was scraping his feet nervously together
   all right but yer better be good or
well git him out then yed better say yer
prayers come on well look at yer damn
ship unerstand were doin it as a favor
fer you well probably lose money on it
  percy incoherently agreed they left the
saloon and started toward the burweed
the slagin twins complimenting themselves
on their cleverness
  arrived at the schooners berth her well-
kept rigging teakwood decks and clean
paint made mikes mouth water with gain
  they went below and into the cabin
the slagins casting appraising eyes about
them at the well-kept room and found it
impossible to hide the grin that comes of
success in close bargaining with the cargo
their share was worth about ten thousand
dollars
  percy had gone into his room and re-
turned with a large official looking piece
of paper and a pen he scribbled a mo-
ment surveyed what he had written then
passed the paper to mike
   sign here-its all straight and proper
give-give me the five hundred dollars
  mike drew the paper toward him and
with much physical labor scrawled his sig-
nature gazing at it as if it was suddenly
imbued with supernatural powers all he
had to do was to sign his name and the
schooner was his mike passed the paper to
john who signed it in turn with an equal
amount of physical effort then percy hand-
ed them a copy and put the original in his
pocket he had gathered his portable be-
longings together and stood ready to leave
  followed by the slagin brothers he went
on deck and headed forward toward the
focsle at the entrance to the latter was
a sand locker he lifted the heavy hatch
and was preparing to enter when mike in-
terrupted here was additional meat for
the hammer for the moment he had for-
gotten the stake of which the little man had
spoken
   hey wherere you goin to he
questioned john seconded the demand
belligerently
   i gotta get something-something i-
got-here percy mumbled  it-it isnt
in the agreement-you-you didnt buy
nothing but my share of the schooner he
said fumbling at the latch
   no you dont little boy john snarled
 the schooners ours we got the paper
here ye dont take nuthin out o the ship
now see cupidity blazed in their nar-
row piggish eyes this was the summit
and culmination of their days luck
   if we bails mullen out ye wont need
any money where yell be agoin mike re-
minded him calmly  dont fergit we got
the paper all signed an bindin we got
our signatures on it anything that had
mikes name on it was possessed of a mys-
terious power-the power in direct ratio
to the effect it required him to scrawl it
   but- percy was flustered  you-
you bought the schooner-not my savings
the little man was writhing biting his
nails his eyes were filled with tears his
feet shuffled and twisted  please-please
-i gotta get it i-i gotta he dived
for the narrow opening and wedged his
shoulders in
   no yer dont mike growled jerking
him out beat it he advanced on
percy menacingly  gwan make
knots fer im goin ter bail mullen out in
an hour

argosy-alt-story weekly
  they shoved and shouldered the protest-
ing percy aside and on to the wharf
  as soon as percy was on the dock mike
and john piled hastily for the sand locker
and wedged themselves through the narrow
opening
   ho mike me boy aint this luck
john chuckled  aint this a fine piece o
business a crackin fine vessel she is an
all ours too we got the papers all signed
an theyre bindin
   an a stake all stowed away too mike
added  a nice little nest egg lets go an
dig in the sand
  conversation languished in the heat of
the search they dropped to their knees
and pawed the clean sand over digging in
the comers in the center everywhere per-
spiration began to dot their faces they
dug harder and faster the sand fell in
cascades from their backs where their eager
hands had flung it john found a piece of
coral rock mike snatched it thinking it
the fruit of their search they had half
buried themselves in the sand when john
suddenly stopped over his head had
sounded a stealthy footfall
  suspicion began to dawn slowly like the
head of a turtle breaking through a scum
of slime on a pool of stagnant water the
suspicion materialized into a hatch top that
rattled and jammed into place the bolt
shooting home
   hey i on deck there were down
here mike shouted at the top of his lungs
 open up
  they heard a voice answer a voice that
was mild gentle and reassuring
   im-im sorry-cant let things go on
like this-terrible-regrettable
  it was percy his voice quavered
   im going down-and bail mullen out
they heard his footsteps grow fainter and
fainter then mike began to shout fran-
tically
   let us out we own half o this
schooner we order ye to  then to john
he gasped  hes tryin to git out o his bar-
gain hes craw-fishin there aint no
stake down here-he was lyin-its a
trick
  another voice harsh forbidding sounded
through the hatch
   youse guys pipe down i gotta hand-
ful o marline-spikes here well get yer
hair parted in a minute
   but this is our ship were the own-
ers mike yelled  we got the papers to
prove it
  the ominous rattle of a marline-spike
sounded on the hatch  gwan back to
sleep
  john gazed once at mike-mike gazed
once at john and with that they hurled
themselves forward the sand locker rever-
berated with the sounds of combat groans
shrieks curses and thumps came forth
accusations denunciations denials and
over it all was one of percys sailors sitting
on the hatch marline-spike in hand
v
  the schooner burweed was at sea the
early morning sun bathed the-clean limbed
little vessel in a flow of molten brass two
figures were on the afterdeck percy was
explaining to mullen
   you see jack i hadda make the fight
look real i hadda do everything up all
ship-shape and bristol fashion
  two angry wild-eyed men interrupted
him
  yer crooks we got yer where we want
yer yer shanghaied us yer aint got
our names on yer articles we own half o
this schooner heres our bill o sale
mike waved it over his head  we signed
it an its bindin
  the bosun led them away forward hand-
ed them a deck scrubber and commanded
 none o yer slack savvy massage
that deck a while
  mullen had percy by the collar  ye
little runt what did ye do
   its-its like this jack percy chat-
tered  they cant read they-they said
so themselves-they shanghaied you an
me-cause they couldnt read the ships
name
  mullen cut him off  but they have a
bill o sale all signed by themselves you
saw it
   taint a bill of sale percy answered
 they signed articles as deck hands for a
six months voyage
by harry varley
words are queer creatures they
have in them more possibilities
for good or evil than men and
women they are not as you may think
self-contained colored blocks of wood
which arranged in certain sequence have a
definite meaning no sometimes they
live and breathe with the accumulated
power of a volcano which has stored up
cussedness for a thousand years and with
no heraldic grumblings erupts and vomits
fire and brimstone on an innocent world
  one word sent howard jackson halfway
around the earth it was not a womans
 no  or  yes goodness knows those
two words have enough to answer for
  jackson was strolling through a native
bazaar in bombay doing nothing for once
in his busy career two women-ameri-
cans he judged from their dress-were look-
ing at some ivory chessmen as jackson
passed them the tail end of a speech fell
on his ear  -reminds me of millers shop
on fifty-seventh between fifth and madi-
son
  that  madison  stopped jackson in his
tracks it is possible for a drowning man
to see his entire life in the moment before
he loses consciousness for this one word
madison flooded jacksons ears and literally
swamped his mind a slice of his life passed
before his eyes a million times faster than
the speeded-up movies could show it
  he was seven years younger and back in
new york city in a little front room in
the brownstone house at  madison ave-
nue-he and jane overton were talking
it was two hours before steamer time
   you will be true to me jane even
though we have agreed not to bind each
other with a formal engagement
   yes howard
   and you will wait for me i know
that ill make good with the standard rub-


argosy-allstory weekly
ber company and when i do-it  only
take a year or two-ill come back for you
will you wait
   i will i love you howard and i
dont care if you stay away ten years
youll find me waiting here by the window
when you come back -which was a silly
promise to make particularly in new york
  they kissed and parted on the ship
howard wrote several letters when he ar-
rived in bombay he immediately became
altogether entangled in the business of
 making good so that he neglected his
correspondence finally he stopped an-
swering janes letters until she in her pride
could write no more
  for a time conscience gnawed howards
internals but he opposed his conscience by
all the tricks men use and then one night
he figuratively seized his conscience by the
scruff of its neck and kicked it out of his
existence
  and he made good money came to him
easily work even under the scorching sun
of india was second nature to him whisky
and soda and women-the terrible trio of
temptations for the american in india
could not touch his life his mind was a
vase full of the pea soup of business-too
full for one drop of the perfume of romance
to be added
  it was too full until after the long seven
years he heard that one word madison
the word haunted him it had no definite
form it was fluid-alive neither had it
a settled color it was opalescent but in
every shape and every light it fastened
itself upon his imagination he would wake
up at night hearing again the woman in
the bazaar say madison
  and soon he realized that this thing had
become a part of him-that he could never
rest or be happy again unless he made his
pilgrimage to his special mecca which was
 madison avenue new york city
there to confess his sins of omission to the
lovely jane overton and receive her for-
giveness
  he made up his mind and packed his
trunk simultaneously as he put in layers
of shirts he thought of the great desira-
bility of jane that her lovely personage
would be one to possess how she would
grace his household and make his exile
sweet by the time he clamped down the
lid he was already married little jane and
howard aged three and five approximately
were playing in the garden and the ayah
was calling them to tiffin
  all the way across the ocean howard
dreamed his dreams of married happiness-
to the great annoyance of some of the wom-
en passengers who would have been glad to
flirt with him could they have broken down
the barrier of visionary stuff more real than
concrete that surrounded or enveloped him
  that jane may not be waiting never oc-
curred to him not once did the faintest
suspicion cross his innocent heart that she
might not have kept her promise-that she
would have been a foolish maiden if she
had and that however much she loved
howard he had been away seven years and
she lived in new york
  new york and jane was a lovely crea-
ture who would be exceptionally fascinating
to the jaded bored men of manhattan
through a habit formed because of an
invalid mother who needed her care she had
always kept herself away from the turmoil
of broadway and had a minimum of seven
hours sleep at night therefore she was
radiant as a fresh may morning in killar-
ney
  jackson was spared from even the imag-
ining of knowledge that might have proved
his mission a wild-goose chase
  when he saw the skyline of new york
it gave him a thrill it meant jane to
him a white gull sweeping over the ship
as it steamed through the narrows sang
jane to him-but a prophetic fog came
up and shut out the gull and new york
and slowed down the boat until it was late
before they finally docked and had passed
the customs
  jackson taxied directly to the biltmore
across the street from  madison he
tried to get a room on the madison avenue
side of the hotel so that he could look across
at her house and think of her sleeping
there not knowing how near he was there
was none he had to take a room on the
forty-third street side of the hotel he
consoled himself by thinking of the good
nights sleep he would get the careful toilet
one word

he would make in the morning and of the
fact he would look so much better after
sleeping again in a bed that kept still
  he undressed put on his white silk
pyjamas stood in front of the mirror in his
room he looked at his face and imagined
he had not changed much in seven years
true he was tanned and had grown a small
mustache in imitation of the british officers
he knew in bombay then he rehearsed
his meeting with jane trying to put an
agony of appeal into his voice he talked
aloud seeking to get just the right note in
it and with the note the barrymore gesture
of supplication
   jane my jane i have come back
to you will you forgive me he even
debated whether it would be better to say
 come back to you  or for you
  he dropped into sleep still murmuring
 jane my jane
ii
  now while he was sleeping we could go
back and find out what happened to jane
but we may as well dispose of howard
jackson
  he arose in the morning he bathed
he shaved trimmed his mustache and
dressed carefully in a light suit then he
went out to meet his jane he came to
the corner of forty-third and madison and
his eyes leaped across to find the brown-
stone dwelling at  instead he saw cut
in the side of a big commercial office struc-
ture  canadian pacific building
  bewildered stunned literally over-
whelmed by the shock that jane had gone
that life had played a cruel trick on him
he stood stock still for fully five minutes
the absurd asininity of his behavior in
dashing across the earth when a cable would
have saved him the trip smashed him be-
tween his minds eyes turning he dashed
into the hotel talked hurriedly with the
man at the  travel  desk picked his ship
for india and checked out of the biltmore
to go to the astor hotel until his boat
sailed he simply could not stay near
the scene of his tragedy
  three days later he boarded the boat and
went back to bombay where confidential-
ly whisky and soda and women the trio of
temptations that beset americans in india
found that competition against them had
vanished which is what jackson richly
deserved he had no right to treat the
lovely jane as he had
  now that he is disposed of-what of
jane
hi
  janes mother died soon after jacksons
letters stopped that was coincidence-not
cause and effect she left jane the two
brownstone houses at  and  madison
but they were both so heavily encumbered
with mortgages and other obligations that
she had to give up one of the houses to
save the other
  fate flipped a coin her lawyer found
a weakness in the deed to  not visible in
the deed which held  the result made
it unwise for her to keep the corner house at
 so she moved into  she could wait
for howard there just as well
  a few months elapsed along came the
canadian pacific company and bought up
the entire block except the house and lot
at  they argued with jane they
used every method they knew to persuade
her they made out a deed of sale and left
the purchase price open for jane to fill in-
but she refused her own lawyer wept
copiously thinking tears would melt her ada-
mant will he discovered that water takes
a long time to wear away stone he quit
finally as they all had to quit
  around the brownstone house at 
madison they built a big white building
it overshadowed the house it does to this
very day but it could cast no shadows on
the soul of jane within her all was sun-
shine and the birds were singing  he will
came back for me he said he would
  she had wooers several tried in the early
days of the canadian pacific controversy
to win her hand and make her sell out she
was obdurate only one succeeded in es-
tablishing himself more or less permanently
in janes life
  he was rodney stewart a young bank
clerk who had pushed jane from the path
of an automobile one wet day and rescued
her beaded bag from a puddle he used

argosy-allstory weekly
a silk handkerchief to wipe the bag and
start a conversation
  so rodney stewart had called on jane
three times a week for years regularly he
drove up to the house on sunday morning
took jane for a drive on long island and
always he proposed to her three or four
times before she kissed  her dear brother 
good night
  jane had told rodney about the lover
who had sailed away a hundred times
rodney tried to show jane the absurdity of
waiting for one who had forgotten her or
who was dead he told her of the deadly
cobra the man eating tigers the cholera
the fever the whisky and soda and women
-all the dire possibilities of india but
jane put her rosy fingers on his mouth and
would not let him talk
  but the years began to have their effect
time was on rodneys side a woman who
wants love husband babies will not forever
be denied nature waits in ambush and
sometimes though it be in the most inop-
portune inappropriate and unromantic
time nature will have her way and the bar-
rier will be downed
  and so it was with jane one sunday
morning she was standing in the window
looking across the avenue at the biltmore
rodney was glancing at the morning herald
picture section when suddenly he looked
up to ask jane to come and see a new
picture of mrs castle but the words died
on his lips the sunlight softened as it
filtered through the courtains fell on janes
face and he saw such a loveliness that
poets vainly try to describe
  it was a new jane the same yellow
hair the same blue eyes and small delicate-
ly chiseled aristocratic nose and the full
beautifully lined lips but there was some-
thing different not just expression it
was a feeling that was the word a feeling in
her face he had never seen before
  love swept through him inspired with
                               xj
 a masterful courage strangely new he
 called
   jane come here
    without wonder smilingly and with ut-
 ter surrender she went at his outstretched
 arms and lifted her lips
     no more of this  brother  stuff jane
    no dear
     you will marry me
    it was a declaration-not a question
     any time you say rodney
    and so for a time they talked the inti-
  mate and glorious nonsense which would
  have to be set down if this were a love
  story but the only part of their conversa-
  tion which we care about is this
    tell me jane why have you refused
 me for so many years no never mind
 that tell why on this sunday morning
 of all mornings you finally gave in and
 promised to marry me
   she waited a moment rodney saw the
 same feeling come over her face that he saw
 when she stood in the window
    for seven years i waited for howard
 jackson you know that i used to dream
 about him at night when i curled my
 hair i would look in the glass and see his
 face instead of mine it grew worse lately
 i began to be afraid i was losing my mind
 so to-day this morning something hap-
 pened while i was at the window i-i-
 she stopped he squeezed her hand
     yes jane tell me
     i actually thought i saw howard jack-
  son himself standing on the corner looking
  up at the house but of course it was my
  imagination this man had a mustache
  besides howard never wore a light suit
  and this man did i dont want to keep
  on seeing ghosts so i decided to forget
  him you will help me dear wont you
  they kissed each other
   at that precise moment howard jackson
 was paying his bill at the biltmore across
 the street

there is one thing so many people overlook-
something that at once brands them as either
fastidious or careless-the teeth

tube you buy will prove this to you
 you will notice the improvement even in the
first few days and moreover just as llsterine
is tho safe antiseptic so listerino tooth paste

injure tho enamel
