 markably easy for any man of average intelligence
 to become a first class salesman and then your
 future can be as big as you want to make it

salesmanship

does

the majority of men are shackled down to poorly
paid positions because they are either afraid to
strike out for better things-or they condemn
themselves to a life of drudgery because of precon-
ceived notions about what they can do

  take salesmanship for instance to the vast ma-
jority a salesman has to be born to his task
nothing could be farther from the truth possibly
you think that selling is a gift

 you cannot be blamed for what you think-but
you are utterly to blame if you do not investigate
as to the soundness of your thoughts for what you
may think may be the thing that is tying you down
to deadly routine and poor pay

 proof that you can be a master salesman

  during the past eighteen years the national sales-
mens training association has taken men from all
walks of life and made them into producing sales-
men theres a statement you should investigate-
but look at a few typical examples of the thousands

month within one year after he completed his train-
ing today he is an executive of postls chicago
j h cash atlanta ga increased his earnings from
 to  a month p m harris a telegraph
operator increased his earnings to  a year-
and is now a sales manager

why you can be taught to sell

  you may think it remarkable that this association
can teach men at home during spare time to sell so
quickly and easily but there is nothing remarkable
about it-for salesmanship is governed by funda-
mental rules and principles there are certain ways
to attract attention arouse interest and make pros-
pects act-certain ways to overcome objections bat-
ter down prejudices outwit competition and get
results once you know these secrets of master
salesmanship you can duplicate any of the successes

the great samarkand

                the swiftly moving story of the quest for the
                greatest ruby in the world by a man who knows
                every foot of the countries covered in this novel

           roy norton

                        illustrated by william molt

when i meditate over the history
and vicissitudes of the samar-
kand it always seems strange
incongruous and extraordinary that i john
roberts should have been one of those be-
ings involved in its fate and that my own
life was thereby changed molded decided
when i think of the influence it has exerted
for hundreds of years i speculate why it
is that the evils it has wrought have been
passed down in tradition and history while
the happiness of which it has perhaps been
the agent is all forgotten for whatever
it may have done for others to me it
brought ultimate and enduring content so
i do it the justice of record

  and adequately to prove the influence of
the samarkand upon my life it is neces-
sary to show that before its intrusion there-
in i could scarcely be considered a success
indeed quite the reverse for i was born
of people with ample means my father
was a distinguished and successful archi-
tect in new york city who endeavored
throughout my youth to mold me to follow
in his footsteps i was given an opportu-

nity for education and made but little of it
barely scraping through never interested in
mathematics engineering or structural
beauties i was sent to the atelier of a
master in paris and-frivoled away my
time in the quartier latin i learned noth-
ing save languages and these i accom-
plished through no merit of hard work but
because i wras born with a gift for tongues
and their acquisition was an absorption
rather than a directed effort i always had
this gift if such it may be called i could
read write and speak four languages be-
fore i had reached my twentieth year in
paris a weird fellow-student from the east
was amazed at the ease with which i ac-
quired arabic one of the most difficult of
languages and a greek girl art student
of whom i was temporarily enamored in-
sisted that there must be grecian blood in
my veins from the speed with which i at-
tained proficiency in her tongue

  i was no good as a real student and par-
ticularly of architecture i was a loafer
my one great love of beauty was not for
sticks and bricks but for the blaze of


the great samarkand



the blue

jewels their infinite shadings of colors the
taste of their mountings the cunning of
their cuttings the perfection of their polish

the news of my fathers death brought
me hurrying homeward and there i
learned that through his unfortunate specu-
lations and misplaced confidence in an as-
sociate i had inherited nothing absolute-
ly nothing that i was penniless that my
days of leisurely dawdling were ended that
to subsist i must work and that regrets for
wasted opportunities were futile i who
knew nothing practical tried many occu-
pations failed in all and finally got a situ-
ation in a little private academy teaching
languages nothing could have proved
more distasteful more humdrum or more
exasperating because i could not under-
stand what to me were the densities of my
pupils i couldnt see why they made such
a fuss over what to me had been so sim-
ple and-i was fired for continually telling
them so

  later i drifted into a clerkship in a
great jewel-house receiving a wage that
merely kept me alive until by chance i at-
tracted the notice of their gem expert an
aged and kindly man with whom i had the
audacity to dispute the matching of a stone
thus i blundered into his attention and
that fortunate blunder eventually advanced
me to the position of his chief assistant
he betrayed an inordinate and almost
senile pride in me boasting of me as his
discovery declaring that i had the perfect
eye and the retentive memory for size
shape quality and color of stones i had
his affection he had mine and when he
died and i was promoted to his place i
grieved because of the means of promo-
tion but for the samarkand i might have
remained in that comfortable position to
the end of my life for my salary was ad-
equate to my needs and desires my work
congenial and absorbing my superiors just
and amiable my occasional yearnings
for travel were amply gratified by those
excursions abroad in the interests of the
firm to purchase stones and having no
soaring ambitions socially or financially
i was contentedly appproaching my thirty-
fifth year when the samarkand came into
my life

it was on a clear midwinter day when

  the sun sparkled from the facets of a
new-fallen snow and the light in my private
office came brilliantly through the big win-

dows that the head of the firm quietly en-
tered he was followed by a man with
whose likeness  was familiar through pic-
tures in the press he is dead now and
there is no restriction upon me but inas-
much as he lives in memory i shall use
other than his real name suffice it that
he was one of americas wealthiest men
whose beginnings as a millionaire originated
in successful mining-ventures in the far
west and who had what the average man
would call an insane hobby for gems
but what i should style a great- love for
worthy beauty he bought great gems
because he loved them his private col-
lection was reported among the trade
to be the finest in america i had passed
upon some of its units for him i had sought
matches for others and his purchases
through our firm alone had been munif-
icent but until that day i had never met
him personally

  mr wakefield said my employer
this is our gem expert mr john rob-
erts

  i felt secretly pleased when our visitor
promptly extended his hand held mine a
moment eyed me with a sharp searching
scrutiny through eyes that were habituated
to measuring men and said so you are
john roberts eh why-you are a much
younger man than i had conceived you
to be i thought you must be old

  its a fact that until that moment i had
not thought it possible that anyone out-
side the traffic of jewels could ever have
heard of me and i was flattered i was
scarcely aware that the head of our firm
had turned to my assistant and said you
may leave us for a while and we are not
to be disturbed it was when he shut my
office door and locked it that curiosity
became my dominant emotion we seated
ourselves and mr wakefield with a strange
look on his firm resolute and kindly face
took from the inside pocket of his coai a
battered worn jewel-case from whose cor-
ners the leather had long been frayed and
whose wooden backing was here and there
exposed he snapped it open and said
ive come to ask you if it is possible that
this is a ruby

  he put before me on my desk a livid
glowing fascinating pool of flame that ap-
peared to snap and scintillate with joy of
the sunlight which streamed upon it
flooded it gave it fresh life he seemed to
appreciate the swift reach of my hands my
stifled exclamation of astonishment my
book magazine

temporary bewilderment and then my eye
seized upon a peculiarity of the cutting up-
on a very tiny break in an edge at one end
and i cried good heavens its the sam-
arkand

lie had been leaning forward in his seat
a  with his hands on the edge of the table
and nowr with an abrupt relaxation drew
a deep breath and settled back into his
chair

  there can be no doubt of it you
think he asked as if for confirmation as
i carried that marvelous gem to the window
where a still stronger light crept to its very
heart and studied it studied it im not
certain that it wasnt a caress none but a
man of my calling can understand the emo-
tions evoked by such a rare jewel such a
historical and distinguished gem a veritable
emperor of stones in my time i have
seen some great rubies in the collections
of indian princes but never before and

i hate jewelry
pearls and bar-
baric ornaments
she declared

never again shall my eyes behold such
concentrated beauty and perfection as were
embodied in the samarkand

  my employer examined it and from his
commercial soul muttered three millions
easily worth three millions maybe more
eh roberts eh

  i didnt answer him but glanced at mr
wakefield whose eyes caught mine and in
them i read something akin to contempt
for one who could see such beauty and
consider only its monetary value i think
i must have indulged in a smile for i saw
a fleeting twitch around mr wakefields
mouth and then he turned to my employer
as if answering his words and said quietly
no-not three millions nor ten nor
any sum it is not nor ever shall be while
i live on the market it would be like-
the great samarkand



like peddling a queen in a native bazaar

  with a gesture that was like a reverent
caress shielding protective he took the
gem gently closed the case and replaced
it in his pocket he stood up buttoning
his coat as if to add to its security and then
said of course you understand there
are reasons many reasons why i wish you
to say nothing of this or that the sam-
arkand is in my possession

  yes said my employer we under-
stand it might be-ummh-even dan-
gerous

  quite so mr wakefield agreed in-
deed i am wondering just what i should
do about it he stared absently at the
floor frowning a little as if concerned with
his own thoughts and finally said well
anyhow i have it

tviy employer followed him out through
the door and i fell back to my cus
tomary tasks which had become strangely
dull and prosaic six rare diamonds had
to be appraised an antique taken down
and weighed and yet all these had been
dwarfed to rubbish rendered insignificant
under the influence of that brief visit of
the samarkand

  i hadnt got it out of my mind when on
the next day i found in my mail a letter
in a plain envelope which i read with some
slight astonishment

  dear mr roberts it read in a small
neat handwriting i would be much grati-
fied if you can provided you have no other
appointment come to my home on river-
side drive this evening at nine oclock or
thereabouts if this is acceptable please
telephone my secretary so that i can keep
my evening for the purpose of our meet-
ing yours truly henry wakefield

  alive with curiosity hoping that i should
have an opportunity of again seeing the
samarkand and also some of his famed col-
lection of jewels i lost no time in making
the appointment and i rang the bell of
that huge pretentious mansion of his just
as the distant clocks struck the hour i
was immediately ushered inward and to a
small room that seemed from its nature
to be the private lounging-place of the
millionaire all the pretense of the house
its surroundings its interior furnishings
and decorations were lacking here the
leather chairs were deep worn comfortable
and almost shabby a miners battered
old gold-pan hung on the wall and close
by a pair of worn snowshoes and an old

the blue

prospectors pick a dozen homely keep-
sakes shouted aloud that they were sou-
venirs of this mans past and his beginnings
of fortune

  at my entrance a girl who had been
lounging on the arm of a huge chair arose
and i at once surmised that she must be
none other than liis niece his sole surviv-
ing relative who rumor and gossip de-
clared was the prospective heiress to his
enormous wealth his first words con-
firmed my supposition

  you can stay if you wish mercy he
volunteered and then when she hesitated
said this is miss wakefield my niece
mr roberts she is a daughter in all
things but one-she does not share my
enthusiasm in gems

   she smiled exposing perfect white teeth
in a face that was habitually too calm in-
tellectual self-possessed and her eyes
softened with a flash of amusement she
was somewhat distinguished as a beauty
but i thought to myself that i had seen
many others her superior

  probably you who my uncle says are
a great jewel-expert will dislike me when
i admit that i hate stones jewelry pearls
and barbaric ornaments she declared

  dislike no i have few dislikes and
much recognition of the fact that each of
us differs from the rest i said i for
instance do not care for music and per-
haps envy those who do

dut i regarded it as remarkable that this
handsome girl for she was little more
than that in years was not attracted by
jewels which seldom fail to fascinate her
sex wakefield sat and listened as we
talked for a few minutes his eyes indi-
cated amusement as i defended my obses-
sion and she thrust again and again at
what she asserted was merely an unsur-
pressed instinct of the primitive but when
she was called from the room he became
immediately serious he somewhat star-
tled me with his first words

  roberts he said im in a quandary
i dont know what to do ive approxi-
mately stolen the samarkand

  my look of astonishment was caught
yes he said in his serious even
voice to all actualities im a thief and
i want your advice i can trust you ive
made inquiries moreover you and i alike
understand the love of stones-not for what
they cost but for themselves i was fur-
ther convinced of this yesterday from the
book magazine



very way in which you handled the samar-
kand i made up my mind that you with
your knowledge of the difficulties of my
position your general knowledge of how
jewels are marketed dealt with handled
could perhaps tell me better than anyone
else what to do

  commercially i objected i am a sim-
pleton a failure had you asked the head
of our firm mr-

  the very man i shouldnt ask he ex-
claimed all he knows of stones is what
they cost and for what profit they should
sell pfaugh to him they mean nothing
of beauty of imagination no he couldnt
understand and therefore his advice would
foe worthless i know that you must be
repressing a profound curiosity as to how
the samarkand came to my hands and
what its adventures since it was last in
the public knowledge so ill tell you all
i know it goes back to the question that
has become commonplace has been so
much written and talked of-namely what
became of the crown treasures of russia
that were in the kremlin when the bolshe-
viki burst loose as you know many of
those jewels found their way to america
through bolshevist emissaries but have
you heard of the trainload of valuables that
was hurried eastward that it disappeared
when the japanese demanded that it should
be guarded by their own selected men when
it crossed manchuria en route for vladivos-
tok to which it was destined and that no
man of that russian guard was ever heard
from again nor that treasufe-train do
you know that strange jewels have since
been sold by japanese and that there is a
possibility that the gold derived from those
sales is at this moment in the japanese
treasury

i told him that i had heard of such
rumors but was without definite or
credible knowledge of any kind

   well he said thoughtfully that great
ruby came to me through the hands of a
russian on whom i took pity and have
made a sort of man-of-all-work around my
house he is an extreme rarity for as far
as i know he is the sole survivor of the
russian guard that was to protect that
treasure-train to vladivostok the exter-
mination was effected one night outside of
harbin this man due to the fact that
the few crude sleeping berths were all oc-
cupied had crawled beneath one and to
that exigency owes his life recognizing

by roy norton

his helplessness when the deliberate slaugh-
ter took place he remained in hiding the
japanese had to transfer the treasure to
other cars because as you may remember
the russian railways do not use a standard
gauge whereas the japanese do hence the
rolling-stock could not be switchedoff at
that tragic junction but was emptied and
afterward burned

  in the confusion the sole survivor of
the massacre succeeded in escaping to a
place close at hand which offered conceal-
ment from there he witnessed the trans-
fer and subsequent destruction of the rus-
sian rolling-stock which was used as a
funeral pyre a crematory for his murdered
comrades and then the new treasure-train
rolled off into the night toward japan and
he was left alone

  he says that he saw a case drop and
burst open while the transfer was being
made and that after a long time he went
to that spot hoping to find anything of
value that would help him on his way for
he had but little money he found a heavy
gold goblet battered and bent which he
seized with great delight and then the case
containing the samarkand he was dis-
appointed in the latter he thought it
nothing more than a pretty and probably
valueless stone or a specimen of finely
colored glass he knew nothing of rubies
he was going to throw it away and kept it
solely because it took up little room in his
overcoat once in his flight across man-
churia he tried to trade it for a loaf of
bread and was laughed at but he was
lucky enough to get through to vladivostok
and there to get a job as stoker on a tramp
bound for vancouver and his superstition
led him to attribute some of his good
fortune to his piece of cut glass so he
clung to it as a good-luck piece and for
years he has kept it

  i found him one night when he was be-
ing driven from a park bench by a police-
man took pity on him because i could see
that he was not an ordinary tramp gave
him some change and told him to come to
my gardener the next day if he wanted to
work he came punctually and nothing
but his insistence got him a place because
i had forgotten to speak to the gardener
he proved himself so willing so kindly and
such a handy man that the gardener has
conceived a great liking for him also this
strange exile is fond of children and formed
a great attachment for the gardeners child
a little girl
the great samarkand



the blue

  well one day recently i went into my
garden at an early hour and out to the hot-
house the little girl was in there playing
in an unused corner had a house laid
out with pieces of sticks bricks and stones
and there among the lot in a place of honor
in what she called her parlor was the
samarkand you may imagine my surprise
my excitement and the investigation i im-
mediately instituted

  when i traced it down to that poor
devil of a russian and took him to this den
to question him he was frightened and im-
ploring he thought he was to be accused
of theft of some sort and in his broken
english begged me to have mercy and not
discharge him he had no hesitancy what-
ever in telling me how he came into pos-
session of what he thought to be nothing
but a bauble it wasnt that which terri-
fied him but the fact that he had found
that gold goblet and disposed of it piece-
meal he feared that he was to be sent
back to russia or perhaps to japan for
that what an absurd fear-what igno-
rance but to this poor devil his jeopardy
was real-his life at stake his content-
ment in occupation ended im convinced
he told me the truth of how he came into
possession of that priceless gem and
whatever happens i shall see that he is pro-
vided for in some adequate way as long
as he lives so now i come to my own
predicament

lie paused as if to assert a collection of
difficulties put them in order and se-
quence before laying them in front of me
for the moment he was aloof motionless
and absorbed in this mental occupation
and then he smiled and shook his head
like a schoolboy caught in dereliction

  im-im a mighty poor lawbreaker
he said and then qualified it with -in my
later years i uphold it for two reasons
one that its right and the other that it
pays first i cant return the samarkand
to its real owners for they are gone-
wiped out-brutally murdered second
it would be criminal to surrender it to the
gang that now rules the state from which
the ruby was stolen because it would mere-
ly add to a treasury whose avowed pur-
pose is the debauchment of the world of
law order and peace as we deem these con-
ditions best served third i am not going
to betray that poor devil of a russian exile
to anybody or any law he has suffered
enough to give a score of men their full

share of tribulations has escaped with his
life is happy here and trusts me fourth
if i dont declare the gem to the customs
authorities im virtually a thief an abettor
of smuggling a receiver of stolen goods
fifth if i do go quietly and make my dec-
laration ive got to tell how such a gem
came into my hands admit that im not its
lawful owner and-i dont know what hap-
pens then and lastly id probably have
to part with it and you who know i dont
give a damn for money and who can under-
stand a mans actual affection for some-
thing of such superlative beauty can there-
fore sympathize with what i called my
great predicament and possibly advise me
you know at least what happens to gems
brought forward in similar circumstances

  i dont i hastily disclaimed simi-
lar circumstances i never heard of such a
case nor anything approaching it  know
of ordinary confiscations and subsequent
governmental disposals  know of the pun-
ishments for smuggling for jewel-thieving
of restitutions and so forth but nothing
within my experience is applicable to this
situation furthermore have you consid-
ered the possibilities of danger involved in
the possession of this stone

  how he asked as if for the first time
such thought had been put before him

  think of the great newspaper story
which means publicity to an exceptional ex-
tent not confined to our country alone but
actually international in its breadth sup-
pose you told the entire candid truth-
dont you see that you lay yourself open
to the avaricious greed of the greatest
thieves in the world as well as the deter-
mination of those from whose clutches the
samarkand slipped to recover it by any
means at their command do you think a
gang of bolshevist emissaries would hesi-
tate to murder you for it why that
stone is worth more than the cullinan
diamond which is the largest in existence
and is the prized piece of the crown-jewel
collections of the world you would give
five million dollars for the samarkand and
you are one of americas very wealthy men
to whom five millions doesnt mean so
much think therefore how much that
sum or a fifth of it means to those whose
attention you would attract

  lets carry it further if you would
pay five million i havent a doubt that
there are rajahs in india where rubies are
almost sacred gems and coveted above
all others who would pay double or treble
book magazine

that sum for it heres another point that
you have overlooked-japan if your
mans story is true the japanese committed
wholesale murder for treasure and if this
leaked the japanese gangsters-i dont
say it was the government mind you-will
consider themselves robbed of some mil-

when the delib-
erate slaughter
took place he re-
mained in hiding

lions some of them might try to recover
in that event your life wouldnt stand in
the way and your russian protege would
have his throat cut merely through vindic-
tiveness or to silence a witness forever

  mr wakefield listened judicially to all
i had to say and then with a perplexed
frown seemed waiting for me to continue

  well what then he asked leaning
forward toward me

  as far as i can see theres only one
answer silence-absolute id never tell
another human being what you have told
me if my conscience hurt me id remit
somehow to the government for that so-
called conscience fund concerning which
stories now and then appear what would

be a fair payment of duties and that
would end it for my lifetime at least

i sat and watched him as he meditated
over my advice i wondered if that keen
mind of his so used to the stratagems of
high finance would find any way out of
his predicament other than the one i had
suggested and then when he did speak
his words were a surprise

  if you cared to assume some of the
dangers attendant on such an undertaking
i think i see one course open he said
and furthermore you are the only man i
know whom i could trust for such a task
why couldnt i give you the samarkand
and-

  give me the samarkand i blurted in
astonishment

  yes it was smuggled into this country
so it shouldnt be difficult to smuggle it into
another you would then returnwith it
openly declare it pay the customs duty
on it and afterward sell it to me his
eyes twinkled as he leaned back in his seat
and awaited my reply


the great samarkand

  it was such an amazing proposition that
my mind raced over the possibilities pre-
sented how could i account for its pos-
session what reasonable story could i tell
for its acquisition what might follow
thereafter if either bolshevist stratagems
or japanese cunning evolved plots to prove
me a thief and recover the coveted prop-
erty was there danger in merely carrying
it across the ocean to holland or some
place in the near east and then returning
with it the latter seemed improbable if
its secrets were known thus far to but three
men one a poor devil of a russian whose
vital interests necessitated secrecy the other
this distinguished millionaire who was fas-
cinated by sheer beauty and myself who
was too inconspicuous to be a suspect

  my thoughts were interrupted by mr
wakefield who said see here i dont
wish you to take snap judgment on this
consider it for a few days before you give
me an answer you may think of some ob-
stacle that ive not foreseen you may-

  he hadnt time to conclude the door
opened and his niece came in with a po-
lite sentence that she hoped she didnt in-
trude personally i thought she did but
i was relieved to have a legitimate excuse
in the lateness of the hour for making my
departure and remember that i walked
homeward in something like a maze of
thought wondering whither and how far an
acceptance of this mission might lead me

chapter ii

ft impresses me as extraordinary in ret-
rospect that during the following night
and day i found so many objections to the
proposed undertaking my sole excuse for
hesitancy is that i was contented with my
life in its placid occupations and its pleas-
ant certainties i was loath to leave a
position that was in itself a pleasure
travel had lost its charms the assump-
tion of such responsibility was great and
there was always the chance of my being
involved in a somewhat embarrassing posi-
tion if i were called upon to justify my
title to the incomparable jewel could i
have gone openly to my employers revealed
my mission and asked for a few weeks
leave ofabsence the situation would have
been simplified but from this recourse i
was debarred by the very circumstances
and conditions in which mr wakefield
found himself

the blue



  and all these cogitations i voiced when
on the third night i revisited him my
mind was nearly fixed upon refusal he
swept away my objections as chaff is blown
by a gale my position with the firm
nonsense he would give me five hundred
thousand dollars for carrying his business
through to successful termination work
there would be no further need for me to
work gems did i wish to keep in con-
tact with gems i could thereafter be his
special commissioner money no ex-
pense-account i might run would be of im-
portance to him possibilities of danger
there could be none

  i went from his house that night com-
mitted to the undertaking and regarding
myself as one who had accidentally rubbed
the lamp of fortune i was astounded by
the generosity of his offer not stopping
to consider that after all payments he
would still have come into undisputed title
and possession of the samarkand for com-
paratively nothing he intended to set
aside a quarter of a million for the russian
which-heaven knows-that individual
couldnt spend and wouldnt know what to
do with add to this a half-million for me
my outlay his payments to the customs
and he would still be an enormous gainer
by his transaction but to be fair to his
memory i am convinced that this side of
the situation never crossed his mind it
was the gem he wanted

  my employers were astonished and quite
frankly despondent when i tendered them
my resignation it had never been in my
mind that they so highly regarded me or
that they esteemed my services irreplace-
able i tried to convince them that my
chief assistant was competent but theyin-
sisted that he had not my genius for re-
membering colors i had no legitimate ex-
cuse to offer for my desertion save that
there were certain private reasons why i
must go abroad

  they offered me a vacation but i hav-
ing in view an easily earned fee of half a
million dollars didnt consider it fair to
promise to resume work they then in-
sisted that my separation from the firm
should not be irrevocable until after my re-
turn and i fearing that this connection
might involve them in a scandal if things
went wrong had to decline but i finally
consented to make certain purchases for
them which were in the order-books and
that would necessitate my going to am-
sterdam that jewel mart of europe i

did this because it would serve as an excuse
for my presence abroad in case anyone be-
came inquisitive furthermore an open
visit to amsterdam might assist me to ac-
count for my possession of the jewel in
the possible event of my being brought be-
fore a court of inquiry yet i suffered the
pangs of reluctance and doubt on the day
when for the last time i closed the desk
that had so long and so happily been mine
and turned the keys over to my successor

  there are a lot of misconceptions regard-
ing the jeopardies of the gem experts it
is a current fiction that they customarily
travel loaded down with jewels over which
they pass sleepless hours of care and
watchfulness that they are in constant
fear of thieves or in peril of their lives that
their calling is hazardous and dangerous
but as a matter of fact the usual method
is to make purchases carefully list and seal
them entrust them to the care of the great
express or shipping companies and ade-
quately insure them and their delivery
there isnt a reputable jewel-house in
america that makes the slightest attempt to
evade the customs there is not to my
personal knowledge a gem-buyer for any of
the great and dignified firms in america
who ever crossed the atlantic with other
than his personal intimate articles of
jewelry on his person a thief who robbed
any of the great gem-experts in transit as
a rule couldnt pay from the proceeds the
price of his passage so ordinarily i
should have shipped the samarkand to
amsterdam the necessity for secrecy
once it had been entrusted to my care was
the cause of my first distress i couldnt
follow the routine i couldnt neglect its
protection i couldnt evade a responsibil-
ity which was magnified because mr wake-
field had so implicitly so confidently en-
trusted me i was the confidant of his per-
plexities his desires and his objectives as
well as the guardian of the worlds great-
est gem hence that worn leather case
sewed inside my underwear felt mon-
strous and malignant on the day when
land vanished from the westerly view and
the screws of the steamer that bore me took
on the persistent busy speed that they
would maintain for the voyage

to the veteran voyageur all trips across
a the atlantic are monotonous and dull
particularly in the season when tourists
and pleasure-seekers are few the first
class was not by any means fully booked

and the second appeared scarcely more oc-
cupied at my table there were but five
other passengers two of them commercial
agents two of hebraic origin and the fifth
a japanese student making his first trip
abroad the jews were en route for the
new mecca of their race telaviv in pales-
tine where they proposed to go into the
clothing business and the japanese was
frankly going abroad to study european
trade-conditions hoping to profit thereby
to me he was the most interesting of my
fellow-passengers on the second day out
he gravely distributed his card badly
printed takiyamo fungeri tokyo stu-
dant

  he seemed to be untraveled and ingen-
uous but observant and having learned
from the ships doctor that i crossed nearly
every year shyly attached himself to me in
the role of questioner he spoke fairly good
english but much better french having
as he explained methodically studied the
latter language for three years for the pur-
poses of this visit he seemed to accept
me as a living travelers guide and made
innumerable inquiries as to hotels that
might suit his purse trains railways and
routes he amused me particularly with
his american impressions chiefly gained as
he admitted from a stay-his longest in
one city by the way-of seven days in
new york it was astonishing however
what a complete superficial knowledge he
had of the latter city and i eould but ad-
mire his thoroughness i was also secretly
amused at the naivete with which he told
me he was going first to amsterdam to
observe the diamond-cutting industry learn
how it was done and compare it with the
methods in his own country and that he
thought two days would suffice two days
for a subject in which an apprentice learns
but the rudiments in two years

  on my previous trips to amsterdam i
had always patronized the ristoria hotel
but this time i hesitated for to its staff
i was known as a somewhat prominent
jewel-expert at first i questioned whether
it might not be best to avoid places where
i was known then cjtme the thought that
if i were eventually driven to account for
my movements the more openly i moved
the better hence after wavering i went
to the ristoria

  this hotel has a most peculiar feature
in its interior decorations of the upper
floors the hallways are or at least then
were wainscoated uniformly in plain jap-
the great samarkand

anese mattlflg and paneled with a uniform
imitation of bamboo the numbers above
the doors are small and on a gloomy day
almost indistinguishable making it difficult
to identify ones own passage the door of
each suite when opened enters a tiny hall-
way in which there is a hand basin on the
left a door to the right leading into a
bathroom while directly in front is the
door into the main chamber a peculiarity
is again disclosed in that the door for the
bathroom revolves so cunningly and eco-
nomically that it serves for both the cham-
ber and the bathroom hence when the
bathroom door opens it becomes the door
for the chamber shutting it off entirely
or vice versa the bathroom door is
therefore naturally closed when one leaves
his bedchamber it was to this peculiar
arrangement that i owed an accidental dis-
covery on the third day after my arrival in
the picturesque old city

  i had been visiting various places filling
the commissions given me by the firm from
which i had resigned and in the gloom of
a wintry day walked through the unlighted
hall of the hotel to my suite in a some-
what abstracted mood for the difficulties
of my mission were always in my mind i
went one door too far down the corridor
opened it and stepped in the single door
that served both bathroom and bedcham-
ber was closed on the latter thinking that
this must be due to the carelessness of a
servant i switched on the light and
opened the door in front of me i heard a
startled exclamation the movement of
chairs scraped back across the carpet and
found myself staring at twro men who had
evidently been seated on opposite sides of
a small writing-table and had been dis-
turbed by my unexpected entrance

instantly i realized that i was in the

	wrong suite but that was not all one of
the men was my ingenuous young japanese
acquaintance takiyamo of tokyo and
the other man was one whom i had never
seen before but was such a contrast to his
companion as to make him instantly nota-
ble he was dark of skin heavy-featured
with black hair a well-shaped mustache
and finely shaped eyebrows-and built like
a hercules his stature could have been
scarcely less than six feet and four inches
and he appeared to tower above the lithe
little japanese like a veritable colossus
they had the advantage of position with
their backs to the window on the farther

side of the room but even so i could
discern the big mans frown of annoyance
his quick side-glance at takiyamo as if
questioning the latter for the meaning of
this intrusion the japanese instantly re-
covered his composure and advanced upon
me with quick steps paused and made the
characteristic deep bow of his country

  ah-meester rubberts me give you
pleaser to again see so- and then
abandoning his painful english for his quite
fluent french he hastily went on strange
that we should again meet so soon after
my arrival i came but this afternoon
from rotterdam to pursue my studies of
the diamond industry i remembered that
you said this hotel was expensive but i
lost the names of the others more moderate
you recommended

  i smiled at the recollection of that mem-
oranda book of his in which he invariably
constantly and somewhat annoyingly jotted
down perpetual notes and observations and
wondered how he could get along with it
even as i voiced my apologies and explana-
tions for my intrusion his companion in
the meantime had deliberately turned his
back and stood with hands in pockets ap-
parently staring out of the window over
the array of quaint red-tiled roofs and
forest of chimney-pots that stretched away
toward the spire of a great old church
takiyamo lost no time in getting me from
the room his hands when he finally de-
cided to follow the european custom
caught mine and gently but unmistakably
impelled me toward the door

  i have some business to transact with
the gentleman inside he said apologeti-
cally and will hasten to conclude it and
call upon you he is from my countrys
embassy and-that is he is-but i have
not asked the number of your suite it
is what i shall honor myself by calling
upon you within a few minutes but now
i must-you understand monsieur

  most certainly i answered and told
him my number as he closed the outer
door upon me i had a glimpse of the man
by the window who was holding his head
sidewise as if to catch the last words of
our conversation it seemed strange that
such a man although unquestionably of
some eastern race should be connected
with the japanese embassy it is the
custom of that nation quite wisely and
considerably different from the american
to employ none but pure-bred subjects in
her embassies and legations
 alibi i excused myself from waiting and
 passed out into the street where in a con-
 venient doorway i watched for the two
 men when they came i immediately in-
 tercepted them

   pardon me i said but a short time
 ago i saw you in the office of mynherr
 rechkampf i too am a purchaser of
 jewels provided you have what i seek
 and took from my pocket one of my old
 business cards

instantly i
realized i was
in the wrong
suite

an the following day while in a brokers
v office i met with what seemed to me
at the time good fortune the broker who
was an old business acquaintance slyly
called to my notice two men who were
occupying his attention when i arrived and
whispered unquestionably bolsheviki
who have some confiscated jewels to sell
now ordinarily men of this stamp
aroused in me no other emotion than keen
dislike not untinged with curiosity for a
vivid imagination is not required to sur-
round anything of which they dispose with
the grim hue of red tragedy or sordid
misery but now here at hand was a
suggestion for my private plot my possible

for gentlemen who advocated and pre-
sumably practiced the universal brother-
hood of mankind they were decidedly
stand-offish they didnt seem to trust me
but they promised if they found time to
let me hear from them on the following
day feeling that i had taken the wrong
method of approach i left them but hap-
pening to glance back as i made the first
turning in those crooked delightful old
streets i saw them reentering the shop of
the broker and smiled to myself i sus-
pected that they were going to make in-
quiries regarding me and my bona-fides
it proved true for while i was dining in
lonely leisure in my hotel two of them
called and this time i made no mistake
for i began my overtures by inviting them
to coffeend cigarettes in the lounge they
had no objections to vodka despite the pro-
hibition sentiments supposed to prevail in
their country and showed some inexperi-
ence in the sale of jewels by telling me that
they had a case of their most valued stones
with them for my inspection

that for me would be useless i said
declining their proffer i must have day-


the great samarkand



the blue

light to make the purchases i seek and
then glancing over my shoulder i saw that
another party had entered while we had
been sitting there and was not entirely
out of earshot had its members been dis-
posed to eavesdrop an habitual caution
impelled me to give the russians advice
and i motioned them to join me in another
seat farther removed and behind a huge
four-leaved ground-glass screen that formed
a sort of invalids corner away from
possible draughts looking teir surprise
they followed me and the waiter brought
our refreshments to the nook

   i brought you in here i said be-
cause it was unwise of you to talk so
loudly even as it was unwise to bring with
you the parcel of gems of which you spoke
furthermore i think it might be best
rather than carry such property on your
persons through the night in a strange city
that you let me have your case locked up in
the hotel safe tonight i suppose your in-
quiries have convinced you of my honesty
and offer this merely as a friendly sug-
gestion

they had the good sense to agree with
me and after making certain that we
were unwatched the case was transferred
to my pocket it was not too soon for
one of my visitors suddenly felt his vodka
it is one of the curses of that insidious
rye brandy that up to the moment it takes
effect its victim is blissfully unconscious of
the kick to come but then he certainly
knows-usually too late

   yes yes monsieur it is time we left
the soberer of my visitors exclaimed with
an apprehensive look at his companion and
turned to the latter to insist upon immedi-
ate departure i was just pushing my
chair back from the table when discern-
ing a shadow through the screen glass i
looked upward a man so tall that his
black eyebrows large dark eyes and blue-
black hair were visible above the top of
that six-foot screen was taking a hasty
glance into our seclusion there was
nothing in that to alarm me in a country
where one comes constantly into contact
with foreigners who are not devoid of al-
most childlike and sometimes impertinent
curiosity but i thought hastily of what
that interlopers stature must have been
and somehow my mind swished to the pic-
ture of that huge man i had seen in taki-
yamos room i looked for the sight of a
man that tall when we passed from behind

the screen but the room and the lobby were
both empty and the intruder whoever he
was had disappeared

  nor did i see anyone when having made
an appointment with the russians for the
following forenoon i returned from the
door and made my way to the managers
office where i obtained a large envelope
some sealing-wax and sealed and deposited
the packet of jewels in the hotel safe
even as i did so i smiled inwardly think-
ing how much greater value was even at
that moment securely resting in a chamois
bag against my breast beneath my under-
wear-the samarkand in the privacy of
my room a short time later i took it from
its case and gloated over its beauty before
retiring to rest no gloating isnt quite
the word to express my emotions for it was
not mine although it was the key to my
fortunes and the object of my solicitude
i think that in some inexplicable way there
had been formed between the samarkand
and me a bond of companionship or friend-
ship-i am not certain which in my
dream that night it came to life and told
me long tales of past centuries of dead
loves and hates of many a lost enterprise
many an intrigue

  i was awakened by my russian visitors
who came a full hour earlier than that
appointed and after making a hasty toilet
i had them sent up to my room sent up
with the continental breakfast of coffee and
rolls as it were for they arrived together
and their arrival provoked astonishment

  the man who had left me in compar-
atively sober guardianship of his comrade
came in with a bandage wrapped compactly
around his head and his fellow who should
by all rules of compensation have been the
sufferer was grave but clear-eyed

  our jewels-you have them safe the
clear-eyed man asked without preliminaries

  i presume so i replied i will ask
the office to send the sealed parcel up and
we can see and i immediately tele-
phoned to the managers office

  what has happened-an accident i
asked of the bandaged man

  wait until we get our parcel again
its-its a story incredible cannot
understand it he mumbled and i being
hungry poured my coffee

  the manager appeared in person handed
me the packet and asked for the receipt
he had given me which after examining
the seals i returned i gave the package
to the clear-eyed man who hastily tore off

the cover opened the case looked for a
moment then snapped the catch shut and
with a great exhalation of relief said in his
native tongue thank god

  placidly i continued with my breakfast
but he turned to me and said in his thick
french that created liaisons where there
were none and omitted them where they
should have been monsieur we owe it
to your experience wisdom and advice that
these were not stolen last night i myself
was in somewhat of a daze and was easily
overpowered when we were fallen upon in
a dark narrow street by three men my
comrade fought until struck over the head

nothing of course we did not know this
until we reached a pharmacy near by
where the dispenser aroused from sleep
attended to my comrades wound and we

a man was
taking a hasty
glance into our
seclusion

with some implement that rendered him
unconscious after that they knelt upon
us and searched us with the most absurd
the most ridiculous the most meticulous
care they even took off our shoes broke
off the heels-in fact practically stripped
us and the part that convinces me that
they were after the jewels we brought to
you is that they took nothing from us
they despised our watches our money
our personal things like rings and scarf-
pins and they took-nothing positively

had leisure to examine our pockets but
for you monsieur we should have lost a
very valuable collection of jewels and-we
cannot sufficiently thank you

i found myself speculating under this
glib recital as to its truth the mans
recountal sounded sincere but-

there seemed no use in wasting time

i had my breakfast cleared away locked
the door to make certain that we should
be unmolested and examined the contents
of their case they were good enough
indeed there were four rather exceptional
stones that i decided to buy for the
firm evidently the bolshevists had al-
ready had them to a sufficient number of
places to determine their value for they
named a price that while not a bargain
was not excessive and i took them there
was one rather fine ruby in the lot to which
the man with a bandaged head called my
attention in a rather unusual way

  are you not interested in rubies he
asked of course this is not so great as
the lost samarkand but perhaps-

  i lifted my eyes to his and found him
staring at me with a level fixed stare i
have the reputation of being a pretty good
poker-player and impassive but i some-
times wonder if i started then if my look
carried anything unusual if in any way i
betrayed my custodianship i do know that
the great samarkand

i was aware of the possibilities of danger

  the samarkand ruby no this isnt
the samarkand monsieur but if it were
i should try to buy it have you it for
sale where is it

  i stared at him as fixedly as he had been
staring at me and he burst into a throaty
laugh

  that he said is one of our great-
est mysteries no we dont know where
it is or precisely how it disappeared but
we surmise that it is either in america or
japan hence i thought that you know-
ing the trade of america might inform
me

  it was my turn to cover myself with a
laugh and i sat carelessly expectant and
watchful resolved that no word look or
action of mine would give them any re-
sponse to whatever suspicions they might
have cherished for a time they both
studied me and then the man with the
bandage looked at his companion and shook
his head he said something in russian
and of that tongue i knew a smattering
enough to decide that what he said was
no this man knows nothing of it he
can tell us nothing

  immediately thereafter they made ready
to depart and i accompanied them to a
bank where i paid them took their receipts
and my purchases we parted in outward
friendliness as men who had merely ac-
complished a business transaction but i
walked from there direct to a steamship
agency resolved to leave for america by
the first boat and yet i was not done
with them for on that night they again
visited my hotel informing me that they
had just learned that another consignment
of gems was coming and asking if i would
care to have the first look at them

comething prompted me to tell them
 i would see them and was content to
remain over for a week or ten days for
such an opportunity and they as if
greatly pleased insisted upon proffering
hospitality which i found it difficult to re-
fuse i drank but little for i am habitually
abstemious nor did they drink as heavily
as on the preceding night they were dis-
tinctly sober when i bade them good night
at the hotel entrance as they crossed the
street at the end of the great bridge i
hesitated and then stepped outside the door
and into the darkness for it seemed to me
that as they turned the corner and dis-
appeared a dim shape shadowy in the

night of an exceptionally large man moved
from a doorway and slipped after them

  still thinking of this i went to my room
undressed thoughtfully took the samar-
kand from its case again to make sure that
it was still safe drank a small bottle of
that excellent dutch beer which i appre-
ciated as a sleeping draught and went to
sleep with contentment of a decision made
i had resolved to be off for america on
the following morning after leaving a note
breaking my engagement with my bolshe-
vist friends whom i suspected likewise
i recalled just as i went to sleep i must
leave a polite note telling mr takiyamo
studant that i had left in such haste i
had been unable to bid him good-by

chapter iii

i boarded a small steamer on the fol-
lowing morning and applied to the
purser for a stateroom which the agent had
assured me i could obtain without diffi-
culty much to my annoyance i learned
that i could consider myself fortunate in
having one upper berth in a stateroom for
four that being the last available a party
of french and dutch business men going
to america to participate in an interna-
tional trade congress had taken almost the
entire first-class quarters and the ship was
of a character which made the second class
anything but desirable had i not carried
on my person that fabulous gem i should
have accepted the situation placidly for
i was too seasoned a traveler not to endure
patiently surplus companionship for such a
brief time but the samarkand in its case
rubbing my skin at each inspiration of my
chest made me vastly dissatisfied because
i could not have a stateroom to myself i
wished that i had known of my predica-
ment sooner in which case i could have
broken my plans and either sought another
ship or taken the risks of shipping the
jewel with those others which i had pur-
chased and forwarded to my firm yet
on consideration i knew that the latter
method would not at all have suited the
circumstances and so resigned myself to
my discomforts when we put to sea and
there were discomforts enough heaven
knows it wasnt possible to have a bath
in private it wasnt possible to shave in
private in fact there was no such thing
as privacy for passengers on a ship crowded
to its capacity and built so many years
mac ive been robbed- dont know when or where

before that privacy hadnt been considered
a necessity i was compelled to solace my-
self in the thought of the leisures and as-
pirations that would reward me for the
final delivery of the samarkand

  when the great beacon came into view
as our ship lumbered into port i antici-
pated the surprise that would overwhelm
one man my very good friend mac
masters chief expert jewel-appraiser for the
customs department we had on many
occasions wrangled over the value of gems
derided each other for mistakes had small
bets on weights or the matching of colors
frequently we had asked each others
judgment and i still insist that mac-now
dead-was one of the greatest jewel-ex-
perts who ever handled a gem

the men of the trade are well known
to the customs department those who
are engaged by the very prominent firms
are given special treatment inasmuch as
it is known that if they have business to
transact it will be on such a scale that it
will save time to get them immediately
through to the customs official with whom
they will declare hence the boat had
scarcely docked before i was off and by
special request put through to mac masters
himself i wanted to pass him personally
because i hoped to keep the entry of the
samarkand into new york an absolute
secret

  mac greeted me facetiously his bushy
eyebrows working up and down as he
asked what junk have you got to declare
now rubbish as usual i suppose

  think so you old bluffer ill show
you in a few minutes i boasted

  what is it a medicine-bag or some
east indian ancestral charm he asked
when he saw that i was compelled partly
to disrobe to get access to the bag and case
suspended beneath my undershirt

  i said nothing but took the worn leather
case from its covering and handed it to
him unopened i watched his face for the
first gasp of open-mouthed astonishment
for his glow of admiration when he saw
the greatest and most flawless gem of its
kind in existence i anticipated his out-
burst of questions as to how i had found
it bought it from whom and where
somewhat to my impatience he stood with
it in his hand inclined to gossip

  havent seen you for weeks and weeks
he said didnt know youd been over to
the other side say is there anything in
this whisper thats been passed around that
you arent working any longer for the big
fellows

  well ive not entirely broken con-
nection with them i replied i bought
some stuff for them in amsterdam which
will come along through the express com-
pany pretty soon but-what do you think
of that thing youve got in your paws

  he looked at the case then snapped the
lid open i watched him expectantly he
moved over to the light took another look
snapped the case shut faced me and with
a grin tossed the case back to me

  come on with the real stuff he said
im too old to be kidded

  are you huh strikes me youre so
confounded wise that you cant believe
your own eyes any more i bantered
you think that anything that large
couldnt be real eh well old son that
the great samarkand

thing youve been looking at is the samar-
kand

  samarkand the only ruby of its class
in the world the lost samarkand as the
writing-boys call it when they want to fill
space in the trade journals thats not the
samarkand its a piece of nicely painted
glass

  take another look i insisted proffer-
ing him the case

  whats the use look at it yourself if
you want to he retorted

with a sense of proud exultation i
 snapped the lid open intending to
force its contents upon his inspection and
then my eyes fell upon it its dullness as-
tounded me and i caught my breath here
was no flash of pinkish-red like the flow of
blood in the rays of a full moon no danc-
ing glitter of warmth no leap of liberated
flame-but instead a dull inanimate thing
that pulsed no reflected light as i took it
from its velvet bed with fingers that
trembled and brought it closer to my un-
believing eyes

  a medical friend once told me that it
was probably impossible for a healthy heart
completely to miss a beat i am convinced
he was in error for i am equally certain
that then and there mine did not one
beat but several for mac had announced
the truth and that which i held in my
hand was nothing but a duplicate of the
king of rubies cut from glass in a tumul-
tuous wave the consequences of my loss in-
undated me and the thing fell from my
relaxed fingers and rolled outward over the
floor made a broad revolution a smaller
one then another and fell dead but mock-
ing in a bar of wintry sunlight i stood
transfixed with what to me was an over-
whelming tragedy bent forward gasping
and staring at it i felt the cold sweat
break through the pores of my forehead
and then a great numbness an unfathom-
able despair i stepped blindly backward
until the hollows behind my knees came in
contact with a chair and into it i fell like
a man unexpectedly tripped

  good lord whats the matter with
you mac demanded instantly recogniz-
ing the depths of my distress

  mac i mumbled ive been robbed
i dont know when or where but i had the
samarkand-there in that case-carried
it always inside my shirt night and day-
never let it get away from me even when
i slept and-now its gone

the blue



  he was all solicitude for he was not only
my personal friend but a man of infinite
sympathy and profound understanding he
put his hand on my shoulder seeming to
tower above me as i sat collapsed in his
office chair

  man-man pull yourself together i
understand what you feel its rotten
luck here wait and ill get you a jolt
to pull you up

  he went to his desk and brought from
a drawer a flask of brandy poured the
metal cup full and i gulped it hot and
raw was half-strangled and momentarily
forgot a mental anguish in the throes of
physical struggling for breath he picked
the imitation gem from the floor examined
it curiously and slowly put it back in the
case looking at me thereafter as if ques-
tioning my sanity soberness or capacity
for blundering then he shook his head
and said as if answering a question ad-
dressed to himself no its not like you
ever to have been mistaken as to what was
in that case or to have lost it through
carelessness or to have been fooled by a
trick you had it and-

  its gone i finished the sentence for
him and somehow of a sudden became
conscious of outer sounds of the feet of
men in the corridor walking across con-
crete floors of the dull rumble of the city
outside of the clanging of car bells and
the honking of automobiles impatiently
threading their way through the downtown
traffic

  got any idea how or where his voice
pulled me back to sensibility

  not an idea not one dont see how
it could have happened i blurted

  he handed me the imitation and the case
i took them dully and thrust them into my
pocket

  dont say anything about this mac
i requested and as he nodded his head
sympathetically i explained ive got to
have time to think this over and as you
can understand the fewer that know any-
thing about it the better i cant right
now remember a single precaution i didnt
take but just the same it looks to me as
if im worse than down and out

  he grasped my shoulder again

  no youre not johnny get that bee
out of your bonnet youre just taking
part of the count youve got to get up
and make a fight of some sort you must
and if theres anything in the world i can
do to help you-well you know me you

beat it quietly to some place where you can
sit down and think it all over carefully
before you see anyone this is no time for
you to make mistakes if you want me
any time out of office-hours call up my
house phone its in the book and day
or night dont hesitate

   i was but little encouraged by his kind-
liness yet recognized the wisdom of his
advice and so i went straight to my apart-
ment where in seclusion and surrounded
by homely familiar objects i could think
undisturbed and all that afternoon i sat
or paced the floor more or less helplessly
and hopelessly

  of one feature i was certain-and this
was that the last time that i had opened
the case there in my room in the amster-
dam hotel on the night preceding my de-
parture it held the real samarkand i had
neither opportunity nor temptation to
look at it on the voyage across and so im-
pressed with my responsibilities had i been
in that crowded cabin that i had actually
slept with it clutched in my hand and as
an additional precaution had not doffed
my underwear all my thought narrowed
down to the possibilities of its having been
stolen during the last night i had spent
in amsterdam

  i couldnt conceive how the theft had
been effected but i couldnt imagine how
it could have been stolen at any other
time

  the appalling part of my meditations
revolved about the loss to mr wake-
field that kindly liberal man who had so
fully trusted me and who stood ready and
waiting so magnificently to reward me for
my participation in an enterprise that
would seem shady and questionable to any
others than we two who knew all the cir-
cumstances i felt as if i had not only
been instrumental in a great loss to him
through some delinquency of which i wasnt
aware but was suddenly fearful that he
might suspect me of having betrayed his
confidence-been careless or worse yet
yielded to temptation and become a thief

  i never dreaded an interview in my life
so much as the one that i went to have
with him that evening after telephoning for
an appointment and asking him to make
certain that he could be alone i felt
beaten humiliated despairing and hesitant
as i forced myself finally to ring his door-
bell

   i entered with dragging steps like a man
in acute illness he arose to meet me with

his hand outstretched and a warm smile of
greeting he must have read the loss in
my attitude his face suddenly betrayed
perplexity then alarm

  what is it what has happened
something is wrong he said quickly as
the door closed and we were left alone

  the very worst i said i have been
robbed of the samarkand i who in all
the years in all the trips after buying and
caring for millions of dollars worth of
jewels for others have never lost a single
one have lost the rarest of all and-i cant
for the life of me tell when how or where
it happened i never even knew it was
gone until today if you think i have been
negligent or am a thief-

  nonsense he said youre unstrung
youre all shot to pieces i know men
and i know you and all about you get
those things out of your mind at once
now sit down and tell me the whole story

there was such complete trust such
kindliness such readiness to listen and
forgive in his words and attitude that i felt
my lips tremble with emotion and relief
and for a minute i couldnt utter a sound
with that splendid understanding of hu-
manity that had made him great he merely
reached over and patted my knee and
waited for me to regain self-control in
that gentle reassurance i was instantly
brought back to words and felt that i could
talk freely that i should be believed-
could talk as to a very old and trusted
friend rather than to one for whom i had
lost something that to him was beyond
price i told him every detail within my
knowledge even to my meeting with the
russians and he sat listening now and
then but seldom asking a question and
calmly and thoughtfully considering all i
had to offer and then for some moments
we sat quietly he with his eyes fixed ab-
stractedly in vacancy and i waiting for
him to speak

   i cant see where you neglected any pre-
caution for the protection of the stone he
said at last and like you i cant but
believe that it must have been taken in
the hotel for it seems incredible from what
you say that it could or would have been
taken by any of the men who occupied the
same cabin in the ship you are positive
they were all prominent business men

  certain of it the president of the
american chamber of commerce in hol-
land who came across with the party knew
the great samarkand

them all personally and told me of their
wealth influence and prominence

   that narrows it still further to the hotel
and your last nights stay there he agreed
with my own deductions now those
russians-ummh by the way were there
any japanese prospecting around there in
amsterdam

  i met but one japanese since i left
new york i said he made the voyage
across on the same ship and stopped at the
same hotel but he was merely a stu-
dent

  he turned as i spoke his eyes slowly
widened and he leaned forward slightly
and waited until i had finished

  what name did he use did he speak
both english and french what did he
look like he demanded in sequence with-
out giving me time to reply to any sepa-
rate question

  he listened in that same tense attitude
while i told him of takiyamo and also
of what i had regarded as the trivial in-
cident in the hotel and then suddenly stood
up and walked backward and forward
across the room frowning and considering
he stopped in front of me and suddenly
began rapping out instructions

  you may have a long and useless chase
ahead of you he said but i shall pay
all and any expense if you are gone one or
five years you must take the first possi-
ble boat back to amsterdam and if you
think it advisable call in the aid of de-
tectives make them move fast and run
down that japanese as well as those bol-
shevists

  but remember its the jap you are to
go after first of all and quickest the chap
you know as takiyamo was undoubted-
ly a man who had been a servant here in
my house a man who on several occasions
i thought addicted to eavesdropping who
moved about too quietly to suit me who i
thought was very much too inquisitive and
who saved me the annoyance of discharg-
ing him by quitting without a moments
leave on the morning after i bade you
good-by hes the only man i know of
who might be deft enough and clever
enough to rob you of the samarkand on
the night before you sailed its up to you
to get him and to get that ruby you can
do it if anyone can and if you cant-
well its bad luck for both of us but in
the meantime im backing you

 it would be a pious idee said tahoe
 i tim my old sourdough friend as we

   	settled in our big wicker rockers on
 his lake tahoe cabin porch for our after-
 supper smoke to come an confide your
 ambitions to me once that there bohemian
 club thirst o yours starts on another ram-
 page this here simple an child-like trust
 which you reposes in me might lead you to
 go samplin my new batch o moonshine
 which the same i hasnt had time to finish
 yet i has to run her through the machine
 once more and take the dynamite out o
 her some because if you contemplate
 suicide like that i sure prefers you to elect
 some other executioner for yourself an
 not go wastin my new stuff none an if
 i aint here when your insides starts to git
 all arid thataway jess you holler for fat
 loo an tell him you craves to meet up
 with my last bottle of the old stuff thats
 on the top shelf in his kitchen cupboard
 an even with them precautions brother
 you does well to play your hand careful
 like fat loo bein only a chink con-
 siders this here suicide enterprise as bein
 plumb personal an private an not to be
 restrained by no descendant of the great
 confucius an at that i reckon my fin-
 ished product is a darn sight safern some
 o the stuff your bootlegger friend unloads
 on you down in the city

   i was content to ignore the old sour-
 doughs little gibe at my pet delinquency
 and to take his words as a friendly bit of
 caution after four years of occasional

tahoe tim and of
wild days and wild
ways in distant
alaska - by the
talented author
of the hiram
inkweller stories

  its a hunch says
red a hunch jrom
heavenl 

acquaintance with mountain dew as fab-
ricated by these careful veterans of the
sierras i still retained the sight of both
eyes and packed a good digestion be-
sides on this particular evening as we sat
on tahoes cabin porch i was altogether
too contented and comfortable to sustain
my side of any verbal rumpus

defore us lake tahoe nestled in her
mountain cradle softly mirroring one of
her most gorgeous sunsets a sunset hung
high on the nevada hills across the lake
eastward from us-eastward in fact not
merely in my fancy for at that moment
we were sitting on the california side of the
lake on a promontory which forms the
southern border of meeks bay aild with
our backs to the sierras behind which to
the west the sun was just descending
i chose to ignore tahoe tims suggestion
of caution and to invoke his attention to
contemplation i accordingly waved my
hand at the lake

  where in this world tahoe said i
will you find a more gorgeous lake than
that and what other lake in the world
furnishes two sunsets at each and every
performance a little curtain raiser in the
west to be in accordance with tradition and
geography and then the main performance
on the hills to the east where you can look
at it without having old sol bat you in the
optic nerve some lake ill say

  yeah agreed tahoe tim twisting his
chair around until we were two faces east
and both contemplating that chromatic ec-
stasy ive been thinking about her all
day-this here lake tahoe i mean shes
so crazy thataway im plumb fond of her
fact is in more waysn one shes jess like

  me contrary plumb disgraceful thata-
  way in bein peculiar like a chinaman she
  does everything backwards hands you
  a sunset in the east and a sunrise in the
  west a cowboy would call her locoed
  us carekeepers what lives here for keeps
  all year roun from hell to christmas knows
  shes just plain crazy and us we knows
  she dont mean no harm by them upside-
  down didoes shes all right for a friendly
  lake till some squall hits her or till you
  goes and falls into the drink then its good-
  by susanna dont sit up none fer me
  must be some secret shes hidin down in
  that big hole for she never lets a man come
  back up to tell whatever does he find on
  that long wet trail take fer instance
  that dude fisherman what falls out of his
  boat down yonder by rubicon point this
  is ten years ago now an he dont send
  back his new address yet

    if i hadnt known from my many visits
  to tahoe tims retreat that this placid
  lake lying yonder in its evening bath of
  opal was a part of his very life i might
  have thought of him as becoming restive
  and about to break for the bright lights of
  moss-grown barbary coast but i knew
  better and only wondered what had started
  the old sourdough off on a facetious physio-
  graphical trek maybe i ventured try-
  ing to match whimsicalities the lady of
  the lake liked him so well she kept him
  down there and married him

    maybe so answered my host locks
  him up in a nice cozy cave so he cant go
  out nights none maybe you can write her
  up this big brother fellow that comes
  on the air every evenin can sure use
  her for a bedtime fable

    the old mans pretended disdain for

scribes in general and for the present scrib-
bler in particular was not new to me i
could afford to let this additional gibe pass
for right now i could scent a new rem-
iniscence on the fire and tims reminis-
cences were an unfailing gold mine to me
so i hid behind his reference to his highly
prized radio by the way tahoe i
brought up some new dry-cells for that tin
can you call a receiving-set said i

   bout time he growled bunch of
kids from meeks bay is trampin over here
every night this week an they plumb wears
her out aint been able to get a squawk
out of her all day

  then im glad i brought them but
for myself i get all the radio i can stand
at the bo club i answered when the
boys cant get a drink they come up in my
den and try to get distance what i want
to hear right now is more about this lake
for myself i dont think shes at all crazy
shes very pretty and very well-behaved
and as for sunsets in the east anybody
with any sense can see the reason meeks
bay is in a pocket and the hills to the
west are higher than those over east on the
nevada side it follows naturally that-
shes so plumb crazy shes captivatin
interrupted tahoe tim waving aside my
attempted explanation shes so cold in
the summer she freezes the propeller blades
offm them speed launches an shes so
warm in the winter all us carekeepers goes
in every saturday night to save heatin up
our open-air bathrooms worsen that the
fool thing is so high up in these moun-
tains it takes two pailfuls of water out of
her to soak down one dirty sock

  sure i agreed falling in step with his
exaggerations its a prohibition lake
its so high up in the world that even the
water is dry

  you said it brother an on hot days
when i wants to sit here in the shade an
be amused by them broadcastin outfits
there aint a set on tahoe will work but
take it on moonlit nights when loupo and
me wants to go out an commune with our
ancient memories the darn things work so
good we can hear em doin murder in
chicago tantalizin actin up thataway
the wonder is to me i ventured
that anybody ever found it-this lake i
mean tucked away off up here in the
mountains

   easy enough young fellow shes
hitched on to the top end of truckee
river has been ever since she was first

made some sourdough prospectin up-
stream runs bang into her an bein he
wants more river and less puddle he cus-
ses right out ta-hoe with this thing
says he shes went an bit off my river
whatinell will i do with her now ive
found her 

  well what did he do with her tim
i asked keenly relishing the old miners
inventions

  lets her lay right where he finds her
you bloomin chechahco that there is
long about forty-nine or fifty when
every gulch in this region has a bunch of
prospectors fussin around in it after
while he builds himself a raft and floats
himself over to the nevada side its him
that smells out the comstock lode

  same chap

  same starvin sourdough an thats
what i started to talk about this here hole
in the top of the sierras right in front of
us that quartz over in them hills on the
nevada side all them placer diggins back
yonder in the forty-nine country an also
why this lake tahoe is so plumb contrary
i gets her all figgered out jess lately

  so my story was fast approaching i
hid my smiles of anticipation behind a
freshly-lit cigarette

  old bill was over from mckinneys
continued the old klondiker we has a
argument maybe bill he knows some-
thin about the sea him bein a old whaler
like that but when it comes to gold-minin
he aint so much

with much pretended disdain was this
said i wanted to agree with my
host just by way of encouragement but
diplomacy bade me keep silent old bill
winter carekeeper at mckinneys and blood
brother to every trout in the lake was also
a flowing fountain to my thirsty pen so
i merely observed tactfully that an old
salt was likely to get into deep water when
he climbed a mountain

  old bill he opines continued the vet-
eran of the yukon gulches that this here
hole in the rocks which the same now holds
this crazy lake in her hands is made by a
earthquake way back in the centuries
sometime he holds plumb stubborn that-
away that a nice little shake comes along
and rips these mountains wide open like
a big storm might open up the planks of a
old windjammer earthquake nothin i
hears me some geology talks broadcasted
by general electric and the university
book magazine



of california berkeley and then i sits
me out here in the shade and puts my
wisdom to work that there hole out there
all full o lake aint made by no failin
apart of whats now these great states of
california and nevada no secession stuff
up here in these ancient hills no brother
not so this here piece of high-line dredg-
in is sure done by a crazy-headed volcano
what works overtime one evenin till she
gets plumb overheated then she blows
herself up dog-sled and dugout an she
dont leave nothin but a hole full o smoke
an then all them little mountain streams
that is flowin an ripplin an plungin
north an south an east and west they has
to turn right around and flow back till this
here hole is filled plumb up an is spillin
out into whats now that truckee river
we talks about why wouldnt a lake go
crazy in the head when she all of a sudden
finds herself poured into a big lot of noth-
ing way up here where a volcano once
was

   clear enough i replied trying to pic-
ture for myself that ancient seismic suicide
but where old top does the placer gold
of forty-nine come in

   she dont come in you scribblin idiot
she comes out shes smelted in that there
volcanos fiery furnace thousands of bil-
lions of tons of gold quartz is burned up
jess like that and the pure flakes o gold is
scattered in these hills to be washed down
the gulches by the rains of hell-an-gone
years

   and remained right there to be discov-
ered by the hell-an-gone argonauts of
forty-nine i finished glad of an oppor-
tunity to encourage him well you ought
to know tahoe you were born in a bret
harte gold-camp you grew up in these
hills and you made your pile in the klon-
dike im surprised that old bill ever dared
debate the thing with you

   im sure glad he goes an does it that-
away the darned old liar boy and man
im livin around this here lake tahoe
most of my life even on the yukon as
you knows about i am called tahoe tim
by all the boys but it aint till bill gets
me riled a couple o months ago like im
tellin you that i tunes in on this univer-
sity extension stuff and gets me my dope

   and it proves something else i added
something ive often wondered about
now i know why none of you old califor-
nia prospectors ever found the mother lode
your friend the volcano just naturally

by joseph blethen

rose up and blasted that lode to smith-
ereens

  yeah most of it brother howsomever
some little offshoots of the mother is left
over like the comstock right over yon-
der and gold hill an some more of them
quartz propositions scattered about these
here gulches just enough is left to show
a thinkin man what might be if the world
dont go an blow up like that and its
the same way in life which maybe some
day you young fellows goes an discovers
for yourselves you sees something jess
ahead yonder that you wants somethin
you is lookin for for a long long time
an you gets all set to take it when
whang-the world blows up again blows
the thing right out o your hand an you
sets around and watches while another par-
ty walks off with it yeah volcanoes an
wimmen-jess alike blow up while youre
lookin right at em-an some other pros-
pector hits the pay yeah-same thing

  the old sourdough became silent and i
too sank into such a stillness that i could
hear the whispering hiss of my own ciga-
rette many tales he had told me of his
klondike days-tales told to me only be-
cause of the friendship that had started
away up there in the yukon country when
i a clumsy wanderer had stumbled into
his cabin to nurse back to life a badly frost-
bitten foot in general i knew the con-
tinuity of his life his childhood in a min-
ing town his boyhood in the lumber camps
of these mountans his futile years of pros-
pecting in these very hills his later heart-
breaking ventures in alaska his final gor-
geous strike in the klondike and his ulti-
mate retirement to this cabin-his fortune
locked in the safekeeping of a trust com-
pany-with loupo his old husky team-
leader as his only companion but in
none of those tales of his wanderings had
he ever linked a womans name with his
own

th rough my mind as i sat on his
cabin porch that night there flashed
the line alone we sprawl with mem-
orys bulging noons-and i thrilled with
the hope that at last i should be trusted
with the story of the lost honeymoon
and as i waited hopefully loupo came
slowly out of the gathering shadows
mounted to the porch and sprawled sulk-
ily at his masters feet here they were
man and dog trail-broke and true fellow-
mushers of an hundred wildernesses now
seven on the red



the blue

holed-up to idle lonesomely through the
tempered winter of their last years the

picture was complete i waited

there would be a new story out of his
crowded past

t gets me a letter today he resumed
finally an it sure sends me back over
a old trail its from red an this time he
aint got a squeal left in him its in there
you kin read it tomorrer

  this was news and i sat up a bit
straighter red gleason had been tahoes
partner in the alaskan days the two had
fought together through many disappoint-
ments and then had finally located num-
ber eighteen above discovery on one of
the klondike creeks worked it and re-
turned outside with the fortune divided
equally between them but with their
parting red had lost something which his
easy good nature much needed tahoe
tims calm balancing philosophy reds
business ventures soon drained his fortune
and there had followed many times through
the years when tahoes voluntarily di-
vided income was all that stood between
red and helpless poverty and red had
always blamed the partner for locking the
principal beyond reach

  seems like continued the old one
nothin i gver does in them days pleases
red leastwise nothin that he knows
about at the time me i am always holdin
him down headin him off and trompin
on him you remembers that first winter
o the klondike rush when your news-
paper sends you up there and you comes
in on us with your frozen foot well we is
just prospectin then-hangin around the
main klondike strike an borin into them
benches hopin to find that the pay-dirt
aint all down in the creek bed well after
you left us an went on down river to pur-
sue them investigations of yours we jess
starves out so we quits our bench one
day an goes to work for wages right smack
on number one below on the klondike
proper well sir we sees so much gold
dust that spring we gets plumb played out
loadin it into dawson soons we git
money enough for grub we hits out for
ourselves again goin this time over in the
tanana country where we hits a pocket
or two in a creek near fairbanks

  but them pockets aint so plentiful--an
pretty soon were over on another creek
near by an workin again for wages an
one day here comes a chechahco doggin

it out from fairbanks an offers us a thou-
sand cold for our claim which we has jess
left red is for grabbin it quick but i
says no i smells a mice in the way that
sport stampedes it way out from town just
to buy our location right why dont he
go jump it we bein gone like that some-
thin doin over there sez i an he knows
that to jump that claim sure spells war-
fare then when he offers red five hun-
dred for his half an then me i is plumb
sure there is a whole bunch of rats ram-
pagin around the cupboard red is for
grabbin the five hundred an i has one
hell of a time sittin on him till i gets me
the dope straight red always is believin
in hunches you remember an because this
hurry-up bird from town has red hair red
says the hunch is for him to take his red
brothers tip and sell finally i gets red
to agree that we all three turns his red
brothers dog team around an all hands
goes mushin back over them hills to see
whats what

  well im the only real dog driver in
the outfit so i takes me them huskies in
hand an this is where i first meets up
with this loupo dog him bein jess a pup
then an bein hitched back next the sled
first day out i studies him an i see me
hes a born leader while this big dog what
is hitched ahead is an old sulk which that
same malemute is plumb wearin out my
whip so next mornin i hitches the old
party back next to the plow an i puts
loupo up in station number one right
then the whole team lays down on me an
to make it worse red and his town friend
starts to pull the merry ha-ha on my dog
wisdom the whole team did i say
well not exactly this pup loupo gimme
a look that said somethin so i jess slipped
off his harness an confided to him that
here an now is the chance for him to win
a grubstake for life

  and he did i affirmed heartily not
a bit ashamed that i was looking down at
the old musher with more than a slight
mist in my eyes

  somewhat agreed the old sourdough
loupo he takes them loafers in hand one
by one one dog at a time but oh
brother

  the town fellow starts yellin that i am
murderin his pets an hes goin to shoot
the pup-when i winds my whip around his
dude wrist a lot an gives him somethin
real to think about well sir by the time
this pup loupo is ready to call on that
book magazine

there old sulk back next the sled the re-
turns has become a landslide for the new
candidate the lazy cur jess rolls over an
put all four feet up in token he craves a
armistice in these hostilities but this pup
he sure knows his job he has some pri-
vate matters to settle with the deposed
sq he jess grabs that old skunk by the
throat and shakes all them diplomatic no-
tions clean out of him shakes him an
pinches him an gnaws at his fat tummy
till the old loafer is plumb ready to pull



by joseph blethen

gone and the two were back again in the
klondike country prospecting in the upper
gulches of bonanza that i have often
thought should have been red gleasons
lesson but i have come slowly to realize
that a lesson had never meant anything to
that erratic pilgrim unable to profit by

the whole load all by himself then its
all over an i shakes hands with the pup
hitches him in front again an gives the
word well sir i dont know who is the
most respectful reds new town friend or
his lazy pets or red himself in ten min-
utes loupo has turned a bunch of loafin
huskies into a dog-team that can yank the
bottom out from under mount mckinley
an like it arid i has showed certain parties
that i am in no frame of mind to hear any
back talk an we gets home next day an
finds that the boys has hit pay on the next
claim to ours an that chances are our claim
is worth more diggin around in

  and you bought loupo right then
right on the spot-the fellow on the
next claim lendin me the money loupos
been with me ever since yeah an
four weeks later we sold that claim for a
hundred thousand cash

  the wanderings of their trail from this
their first strike was well known to me
red gleason had romped into fairbanks
and had rioted there till the bright lights
and the roulette tables had taken his all
then tahoe tim had gone to him and
again divided the money remaining in the
partnership purse not once but again
and again until ihe whole fortune was

this pup sure
knows his job
-he has some
private matters
to settle with
the deposed

his mistakes he was through life as much
a pensioner on tahoes calm strength as
was the dog at the old sourdoughs feet

  red never thanks me for that little
piece of high financin continued my host
gettin him fifty thousand instead of five
hundred only goes to his head like an
after it is all gone he blames me for not
lockin it up in bonds an things an hold-
in him down to the income

  yes i agreed and when later on
you did just that very thing after your
big strike what did he do i was a bit
sarcastic but i couldnt help it

  sells his bonds from day to day an
bites off everything them get-rich-quick
fellows can think up answered tahoe
tim an then turns around an jumps
on me because i has this time locked my
stuff up tight an thro wed away the key
pretends hes mad all these years writes
me hot letters cussin me from hell to
breakfast for ever makin out that trust
deed but just whered we all be if i
hadnt a done it

  very wise thing i agreed and odd
seven on the red

too-odd that a rich klondiker should turn
his back on the lure of more and lock
himself into the protection of the safest
men in the financial world

  well i dunno not so odd just my
one big hunch that it is up to me to look
out for all of us-an that there trust com-
pany down on market street is sure the
safe way there is loupo an me an
red an-an reds wife

  wife red gleasons wife during
the months in which i had been a frequent
visitor to tahoe tim in this retreat on
the mountain lake and in the previous
chance crossings of our trails in other
places he had never before mentioned the
woman i was hearing of her for the first
time

  i knew that the old sourdough had di-
vided his income through the years with
his good-natured and irresponsible partner
but i had pictured that partner as nesting
alone somewhere on the edge of the ari-
zona desert answering the call of that
wonderland as naturally as old tahoe had
crawled back to his beloved hills but i
had not known that another had shared
reds improvident life

  well now that its all over thata-
way went on the old man musingly i
has this to comfort me i know my hunch
that time is right if i ever meets up with
her two daughters i can look em right in
the eye it is my trust company hunch
saves the money to help bring em up an
when red an me has passed over they
gets the interest money for life

  all over i repeated eagerly whats
all over tahoe

  im tellin you he answered evasively
for once red has to say somethin decent
in his letter about what i goes and does
one time tomorrer as i says jess now
you reads it for yourself but now i wises
you up sos you kin have the dope

as if i wasnt burning to be wised up
but i knew it was my cue to play a
silent part and so i waited wondering
what new trail of reminiscence we were
now to follow

  this here little blow-up im tellin you
about he began after refilling the old
pipe happens when red and me is sittin
pretty on eighteen you knows all about
that claim how we works her for a while
an then we leaves her as a false alarm
and how kate rendo the dance-hall wom-
an from barbary-mrs ben carter she

by joseph blethen

is when she quits dancin-keeps pourin
her money down a prospect hole in nine-
teen jess next claim above us an finally
hits pay way down so deep its the won-
der of the whole country yeah sure you
do ive sure told you about her a lot
an when she hits it thataway ol kate
jess lets out the glad yell an brings all
us upper creek sourdoughs stampedin back
to our extravagant riches jess as i tells
you often

  well when this particular rumpus im
tellin you about finally cuts loose its now
two winters after that glad time an red
an loupo an me were so rich were
plumb worried about it kate rendos
lost kid has showed up him bein that
minin engineer chap an hes runnin old
nine teen for his mother an showin all
us up-creek sourdoughs some inside dope
on how the big fellows gets the most out
of a claim once they busts the lid off an
sees her pannin out pretty an hes so all-
fired human all the time we up-creek own-
ers pulls a party for him at the forks
which the same mighty near stops up the
main klondike river with our dead sol-
diers not that kates kid takes too much
thataway hes a quiet cuss that can take
a drink or two an stop before he loses the
balance of his shootin hand but there
is a lot of the boys that is pent up a whole
lot till they has to rip the roof offm some-
thin an the forks does well enough for
one night bein as how that particular
night is twenty-three hours less one minute
in length and duration

  well along about midnight when the
sun is way round by the south pole an
not worryin none about the yukon coun-
try the kid an me figures we has enough
an seein as how no one will miss us out
of the general mee-lee we slips out to
take a nice long walk home in the moon-
light-yukon moonlight you know shin-
in on what that scribblin fellow friend o
yours calls the white silence but that
she aint so silent jess now we finds out
right pronto for heres red outside lean-
in up against the side of the roadhouse
an talkin to himself

   its a hunch says red when he sees
us a hunch from heaven an me i
goes to dawson right now an plays her
pretty 

   dawson is fifteen miles from here old
top says laurie the kid kinder playful
better you takes a bottle along in your
pocket or maybe your hunch runs out
   this here is no alcoholic hunch says
red an he hugs the kid out of his pure
excess of joy this here hunch comes to
me straight from this aurora borealis you-
all can see still shinin in the sky she sure
shoots me the inside dope

   an what asks laurie carter holdin
red out o the snow might it be which
our midnight friend miss aurora has con-
fided to you thataway only you under-
stand the kid uses the same kind o col-
lege talk i gets over this here radio an
not the flavor us sourdoughs is used to
when free and untrammeled

  i understand said i young carter
was a university man tell me the rest
yeah but you aint heard nothin yet
as your fellow what writes them mammy
songs says in his talkin machine records
the kid an me we both has to go to work
on red somethin drastic to get the straight
of it-but here she is this here aurora
party it bein a clear night an cold enough
to freeze hell out o the deal forever is
sure shootin pretty for seven times she
shoots a fan in the air the said wide
spread-out fans o light havin seven long
red points an then for fear red hasnt
got it straight she shoots her midnight

seven sets of seven flares of this seven-
ribbed red fan whereby red absorbs the
hunch that hes to mush to dawson pronto
stampede into the biggest gamblin house
an burst her wide open by stackin the
u s mint seven times on the red

  at this point i indulged in a quiet laugh
for be it known my sympathies were for
the moment entirely with one red gleason
i have seen the aurora borealis dance in
those yukon skies when i was so cold that
at every breath my lungs pricked with an
hundred jabbing needles but all i ever
made out of it was a sense of awe at one
of gods wonders to read a telegraphic
secret out of that message from the un-
known appealed to me and did he go
play it i demanded

  he does with half o dawson watchin
him an the other half plumb bogged down
seein as they cant get in the place shes
so jammed

  and he broke the bank

  not sos to hurt it brother this here
roulette layout somehow has lightnin rods
up against them clairvoyant hunches no
red dont break no bank but he bumps
into a bad shootin scrape is seven weeks
gettin out o jail an then comes down
bang with seven kinds of pneumonia also
an thereby he runs plumb into matri-
mony which is whereof im relatin


seven on the red

  i see said i she was his nurse
very pretty yukon romance

  not a nurse regular but she sure stands
by red in that fracas an this is right
where i gets into the party yeah it
is like this this girl has jess come in
from outside with her father her mother
bein already in the next world they is
nice farmer people an they aims to start
a greenhouse an all alone by their tw
selves prove that the yukon country can
raise its own garden truck well the old
party is lookin on from the crowd while
red is playin his hunch an when red
an the house-man gets to arguin with
their guns-an before anyone can stop em
the old party is plugged by a flyin bullet
that is meant for red hes sure plugged
sufficient is this old chechahco an right
then he mushes up yonder where they has
flowers bloomin perpetual an dont need
no greenhouses an so red bein locked
up in jail till the mounted gets the whole
thing straight i hustles into town sees to
the plantin of the deceased an gets kate
rendo-mrs carter i mean-to take the
girl home to her nice dawson bungalow
an mother her till we all can get our heads
in one place an think it over old kate
does a good job of it only she lets me
see the girl about twice too often first
thing i knows im in love for fair an
walkin around on my ear

clumping down in my chair i tried
to keep my thoughts from running
away from the slowly unfolding drama
and i could very well realize that old ta-
hoe tim had once been young and that
there might have been-

  this here youngster turns out to be
some sport continued the old miner
ruth is her name-an shes gentle and
shy jess like that sounds shes a blonde
with a lot of gold hair racin down over
her shoulders like the waters in old white
horse rapids an warm blue eyes like them
yukon wild flowers in the gorges below
circle no wonder us forlorn sourdoughs
gets all choked up when we stands aroun

lookin at herwell what does she

do bein left a orphan like that why
she ups an drags old kate right down to
the headquarters of the northwest mounted
police an tells red she dont hold it
against him none that her father gets
plugged thataway at his aurora borealis
party an red lookin at the poor kid
standin there tryin to comfort him he

the blue

jess naturally bogs down an weeps an
then the little blonde beauty she weeps
an old kate she weeps an the red-coated
mounted whats on guard he gets power-
ful busy studyin the yukon scenery out
the window an right there i reckon
is where it all starts only me i dont wise
up to it till later

  well she sure is a busy session for me
that time me jumpin around like i am
like a hungry malemute after a fat rabbit
me im jumpin out to eighteen to watch
the dumps an jumpin back to this here
dawson lawyer to keep him on the job
helpin red then jumpin over to kates
cabin an framin with her for the little
blondes comfort an all the time the win-
ter shes coldern a section from a petrified
iceberg everythings against me even to
my fool tongue for every time i gets me
alone with ruth i freezes up an cant
speak a word an while im helpless like
that she goes every day to cheer red up a
lot and he the lucky dog can talk a blue
streak all day long till the mounted calls
time on em

  well after seven weeks of this kind of
insanity we gets some sunshine the
colonel in command is back on the job and
takes up the case hes a wise old bird
and he figures that shes a private shootin
party with everybody present takin their
own chances so he deports the marble
spinner back to the barbary coast an
sentences red to stay out of dawson for
six months fair enough only this last
red fails to do through no fault of his
own cause he no moren hits our shack
when he comes down with pneumonia
pleurisy the influenza an the doctor says
somethin else that sure moves him to call
her a case of lung trouble well you
know brother lung trouble in a sixteen-
by-twenty-four yukon shack in midwinter
aint no tea-party so kate rendo romps
out with her big sled-horses mind you-
an bundles him down to the hospital in
dawson you know the one them sisters
is runnin up on the hill by the big land-
slip then kate goes to the colonel an
explains things an the colonel man he
hands red over to her on parole an she
an ruth chases over to the hospital an
starts dividin time as nurses between
the two of em old kate richern hell an
little ruth prettiern a angels pet photo-
graph they sure makes that far away hos-
pital famous an when red gets well an
goes over to kates big wickiup in dawson
book magazine



proper to recover his strength a lot us
up-creek owners we passes the hat an we
sure dents that mother superiors desk
with a bunch o nuggets but meantime
theres somethin else bustin loose

   it falls like this red is at old kates
dawson bungalow about two weeks now

hotel in town well old kate orders red

ries wife that is to be all mushes down

im left alone by the open fire with this
ruth party seems like shes prettiern
ever an all this trouble has turned the
girl more into a woman well right then
i takes my nerve in my hands an i makes
out to propose to her an i no sooner does
it than i sees that im shootin our quiet
little fireside party all full o holes she
acts kind o startled when i makes my
put-in jess like as if shed pulled a big
gamblin debt down on her sudden-like an
she dont know how in hell she can pay
out an me im sittin there feelin like
i am killin her old father all over again
oh tim says she i didnt know oh
tim im so sorry yeah jess like that
she says it sorry about me

i oupo let out a human-sounding whim-
per of sympathy and getting up he
laid his old grizzled head in tims lap i
managed to sit up straight but in the dark
i swallowed hard

   its jess like i says earlier to you
brother continued the old man im
lookin right at a mountain of gold and
whang she blows up on me i sees my
finish an i asks ruth not to think of me
but to come clean an tell me whats on
her mind why its red she says an
me i could see by the light in her blue
eyes that i am lookin at some other fel-
lows location papers its red hes
so helpless tim he needs me an youre
so strong-we both need you but youve
done so much tim that i feel dreadfully
guilty oh tim wont you tell me what
i ought to do

   an me i says its all right for the two
 of em to git married leastways i tries
 to say it i aint ever been quite sure
 what i does say that night anyhow i
 lies my heart black in the face an then i
 sees the smile come back in her blue eyes
 an i wishes em well an gets myself out

by joseph blethen

in the air an then down by the river

ice i thinks it all outit sure looks

like a hard trail ahead but me i has
loupo an sez i tahoe well mush it
to the furthest end o nowhere    
right there i figures she says something
this ruth woman red needs me she
says an we both need you jess a couple
o helpless kids-an i sees my duty plenty
plain but i admits when i gets me to
my hotel room that night i am a old
man

  an thats why i locks up my dough

fix it so we all can eat an red sez in
this letter in there that he now savvys it
for the first time an that aint all you

husband for the first time that she turns
me down for him thataway an red says

cussedness cause now hes plumb lonesome
too yeah-asks me to stick thataway
jess as if he had to dont know me yet
that red boy does he loupo never
will will he old dog just a kid whats
never grown up eh

  and old loupo whined again and nuzzled
in closer as i silently picked up a blanket
and departed to the seclusion of the hillside
shadows these lines running again through
my mind

  -yet one thing have we missed you dog
      and i

  no children paw your back nor seek my

        knee

  alone we wandered through those tndless

       worlds

  and lost youths right to claim youths
      fruitful mate

  alone we sprawl with memorys bulging
      noons-

  while fancy leads us through lost honey-
      moons--

  my husky

   crazy was he this old sourdough do-
ing things upside down and contrary to
tradition yes clear out of his mind with
his intent to do for others such a story
of hard sense and gentle sacrifice to come
out of that passionate caldron that was the
klondike-as crazy and at once as beau-
tiful as this mountain lake that staged her

royal sunsets in the eastlong i

sat blanket-wrapped and alone by the
shimmering waters the moon-tipped moun-
tains standing sentinel over my musings
and dreamed my own dream of that lost
honeymoon

         the men of st andrews were up against the
         battle oftheir lives in this stirring story by the
         author of landlocked wings you will great-
         ly enjoy the tale of how it was fought and won

  by homer king gordon

                    illustrated by frank hoban

although the college of st an-
drews was only a six-hour journey
lfrom his chicago home rodney
stephens had stayed away from it his alma
mater for twenty-five years he was go-
ing back now not because he wanted to
but because his son had left him no other
alternative

  jack stephens had telegraphed

  dad

    this is my last football game kathleen
  is coming i have told her you would take
  her to the game you who taught me foot-
  ball have never seen me play i want you
  here more than i have ever wanted any-
  thing else please forget business and come
  wire me when you will arrive

                                     jack

  business-as he reread the telegram on
the train bearing him toward st andrews
rodney stephens wondered if his son had
ever suspected the business excuses given
in the past were only manufactured alibis

  he wondered if jack suspected the truth
that he rodney stephens had been
stretched on memorys torture-rack for the
past twenty-five years painfully living over
and over again a football game played on
the st andrews gridiron

    scattered throughout the world are liv-
  ing monuments whose lives are dedicated
  to decades of self-imposed penance over
  something that everyone else has forgotten
  -or never knew rodney stephens was
  such a man

    his associates knew him as a lion-hearted
  business wizard by nerve and bulldog
  courage he had built a chain of grain ele-
  vators and through years of lean crops
  and cyclones he had fought off ruin and
  made a fortune for himself and for the
  men who had pledged their faith with him

    in appearance he was a fighter there
  was no surplus fat on his tall powerful
  body at forty-five his eyes were as keen
  as they had been at twenty and he moved
  with the same easy athletic grace for hard
  work and careful training had kept him
  in condition

  or several years after his graduation

  	from st andrews rodney stephens
  had kept physically fit for a purpose he
  had meant to go back take one more
  years work on some pretext and play one
  more season of football or at least one
  more game in it he planned to wipe out
  the stigma of that incident in his football

career which had haunted his memory ever
since it happened

  when this cherished plan had become
impossible he stayed away entirely now
it was hard to go back but to make it
easier he had chosen a train that would
arrive in st andrews well after dark on
the evening before the big game in an-
swer to his sons telegram he had wired
not to bother about meeting him as his
plans were indefinite but that he was com-
ing to further avoid old classmates who
might possibly be on the same train he
took a drawing-room and went into it as
soon as the train gates were opened

  as soon as he arrived in st andrews
he intended taking a taxi to the nearest
hotel where he could stay in seclusion until
the next morning then he would telephone
jack and have him bring kathleen over
to the hotel where they could visit and
possibly have luncheon kathleen would
some day be his daughter-in-law he re-
membered her only as one of jacks sand-
pile playmates

  when the train arrived in st andrews
rodney stephens tried to be the last pas-
senger off the coach the station platform
was seething with people but as he stepped
down the vestibule steps he heard jacks
voice

  there he is

  a lithe young giant plowed through the
crowd and grabbed him around the shoul-
ders hullo there you old war-horse
this is kathleen dad-where in sam hill
are you kath

  a radiant girl slipped out from behind
his sons back and excitedly hugged rod-
ney stephens

  what are you trying to do kath
jack demanded

  kiss him of course

  did you

  rodney stephens felt himself pulled
along through the jam the girl dragging
at one arm and his son at the other

  i kissed some one kathleen chuckled
triumphantly

  wheres my bag rodney struggled
feebly to free himself

  its all right jack assured him i
had a couple of scrubs waiting ready to
carry a trunk if you brought one

  where are we going

  the crowd seemed to be falling back as
though they had all been waiting for his
arrival

  here he is he heard jack sing out

  r-r-r-rah r-r-r-rah r-r-r-rah old
rod stephens r-r-r-r-r-rah-some
three hundred voices gave him welcome
then back of them a band began to play
the school anthem and the crowd stood
hushed with bared heads

  as the music ceased a smiling elderly
man stepped from an open-topped car hung
with the st andrews colors rodney ste-
phens class pennant draped the engine
hood

  dad meet doctor campbell president
of st andrews

  i wasnt here in your time the elder-
ly man smiled and offered his hand but
now i am a part of st andrews and for
the college i bid you welcome after a long
absence mr stephens we are proud of
our old traditions and of our old heroes
i think we are now supposed to get into
the car he finished with a cordiality too
sincere to be feigned

  but i dont understand rodney ste-
phens protested bewilderedly

  get in dad jack pushed him up
to the flag-draped car and shoved him
through the door you ought to realize
by this time that youre the homecoming
hero

vvhen rodney was seated by the school
presidents side jack jumped in beside
the driver and the car slipped in line be-
hind the band

  where is kathleen rodney asked
helplessly

  oh shes back there in the mob some-
where his son waved at the cheering
singing students who marched behind the
car shell get a chance at you all to-
morrow afternoon but tonight you belong
to the football team we cant be both-
ered with a girl tonight kath under-
stands

  its remarkable how things have
changed since you and i were youngsters
isnt it president campbell observed
dryly

  doctor is he what you expected jack
asked from the front seat

  in appearance yes the elderly pro-
fessor acknowledged but from what
jack and others have told me he added
to rodney i rather expected you to rush
off the train steps and charge through the
crowd breathing fire and brimstone and
emitting war-whoops

  jacks happy laugh rang out over the
blare of the band
a pledge redeemed

  weve knocked the wind out of him
he explained joyously dad thought he
was slipping in unexpected and unan-
nounced he hasnt recovered from his
reception yet just wait-the fire and war-
whoops are in him all right

  im still wondering how you knew when
id arrive rodney stephens said soberly

  why do you think i keep buying candy
for your secretary jack laughed when
she got through buying your railroad tick-
ets she went to the nearest telegraph office
and wired me your train number when
it would arrive what car you would be
on and the letter of your drawing-room
i got her telegram before i got yours
its a reception i dont deserve
nonsense president campbell object-
ed gruffly my dear mr stephens you
are one of the traditional heroes of our
college you were as famous in your day
as jack is today it is a privilege to pay
homage to real men the homecoming of
you old st andrews men is an inspiration
to our undergraduates and to our faculty
id even venture to say that many a stu-
dent who came to meet your train tonight
will remember your coming when the foot-
ball game of tomorrow will be a thing of
forgotten history and the memory of
your coming will probably mean much more
to them than the memory of anything that
might happen on the football field tomor-
row

  no rodney stephens breath came
sharply football means too much if
i thought for an instant you were right
id crawl off somewhere and hide

  football is no greater than the men
who play it the school president asserted
briefly and anyway mr stephens you
can rest assured jack and i arent going
to let you escape us now

  i should say not jack agreed look
at that pile of logs waiting to be touched
off thats only one of your jobs dad
the gray stone towers of st andrews
rose before them surrounding the vine-
clad buildings were the same giant oaks
rodney stephens had known in his college
days off to one corner of the campus
were the dormitories far down the white
graveled road past the school chapel loomed
the banked rim of the football bowl to
the right was the old gymnasium and fol-
lowing a custom that had originated even
before the time of rodney stephens there
in its boulder-lined urn lay the sacred pyre
of st andrews

the blue

xnt the grass-covered slopes of the nat-
ural amphitheater surrounding the fire
urn were hundreds of students waiting
silently for the beginning of the ceremony
there was no demonstration as jack and
the elderly school president escorted rod-
ney stephens to the edge of the gigantic
urn the cheering mob that had followed
his car from the railroad station now melt-
ed away in silence quietly the band took
its appointed place

  almost apologetically a cornet sounded
the pitch note then the sacred fire song
of st andrews swelled from the throats of
the assembled hundreds solemn and beau-
tiful its majestic rhythm echoed through
the giant oaks when the last note died
away president campbell stepped forward
his voice rang out clear and strong

  men and women of st andrews we
have built a bonfire this pile of dead-
wood is a pledge each one of you has
placed your offering upon it-it is our oath
of good sportsmanship win or lose by
the fagots you have cast upon this pyre
you have sworn to uphold the honor and
the tradition of st andrews it is our
offering to the memory of the men and
women who have made good the name of
our college our heritage

  according to our traditions i give this
taper to john stephens our football cap-
tain that he may have the sacred pyre of
st andrews fired on this the eve of our
last football game of the season

tthe son of rodney stephens took from
president campbell the proffered silver
lamp with its flaming oil wick and faced
the assemblage his voice trembling with
pride as he spoke

  we are honored tonight with the pres-
ence of rodney stephens a famous captain
of a famous st andrews team that will
never be forgotten i cant tell my dad
what i think of him before so many wit-
nesses but i guess he knows that were
all proud of him if the pledges we have
put on this bonfire mean as much to us
as the pledge he burned years ago then
maybe st andrews will some day be
equally proud of us

  he gulped and stopped suddenly his
voice husky

  here-turning to his father he held
out the flickering lamp-light it im
talked out

  in the hush that followed rodney ste-
phens took a pair of gloves from his pocket
book magazine



by homer king gordon

and cast them high up on the pile of logs
then after a moment of hesitation he held
the silver lamp to the sacred pyre with
a roar the flames caught in the dry tinder
and leaped heavenward

   instantly the crowd on the slopes rushed
down to the edge of the bonfire starting
a revel that would be continued until late
into the night in the confusion that fol-
lowed rodney stephens was dragged away
jack hustled him through a hand-shaking
back-slapping mob blocking their path to
a little roadster parked on a side drive

  just as they were about to climb into
the car they were overtaken by a lumber-
ing thick-set figure that had chased them
from the fire urn

  hey there you old outlaw the new-
comer puffed i want to shake hands
with you

  its tim hawkins jack explained un-
der his breath

  rodney whirled with outstretched hands
i would never have know you tim 
fat an forty-seven tim gasped an
when i run i sound like my valvesd blown
out but i come back every year an try
to tell em how to play football the way
we used to play it

hows the leg rodney laughed
sound as a dollar and biggern a bar-
rel tim chuckled hows your ribs
oh i wasnt hurt much in the dark-
ness rodney stephens felt himself flush-
ing and a hard lump rose in his throat

  you cant tell me that tim declared
heatedly i did all the hollering and he
did all the suffering dont let him kid
you jack-he was knocked so flat he
couldnt yell

   he isnt fooling me any replied jack
as he came around the car and shook hands

  where are you started for tim asked
hopefully the clubhouse

  jack nodded im afraid well have to
beat it too

thats all right tim rejoined i
just wanted to shake hands with the old
boy before he got out of running distance
cant we take tim with us rodney
proposed

   no tim protested hastily im going
back to the bonfire ill see you tomor-
row

  tim broke his leg in our last game
rodney explained as they drove off

   we have all heard about it was jacks
dry answer

  what do you mean

  tim never misses an opportunity to tell
the story he is a considerably advertised
football martyr as a matter of fact didnt
he just make his football letter

  yes rodney admitted but he
played for four years on the scrubs jack
we all give him credit for gameness
dad jack apologized quickly but to-
night our football team wants to listen to
a man who played four years on the var-
sity

  rodney did not answer but as they
speeded through the darkness the resolu-
tion he had made as he touched off the
football pyre began slipping away

in order to escape the noise and excitement
which attended the bonfire celebration
on the campus the st andrews football
team always spent the night before their
last big game of the season at a near-by
country club

  during the fire-lighting ceremonies the
football squad had looked on from the crest
of the amphitheater ready to leave as soon
as the fire began to blaze and they were
already at the country club when rodney
and jack drove up

  chad weinert veteran coach and train-
er was waiting on the veranda steps

  well rod he said affectionately ex-
ploring the former st andrews star with
an experienced finger i believe you could
still play football youre a living exam-
ple of my lectures on what football ought
to make out of a man come in and be
exhibited

  the test rodney stephens dreaded came
later in the evening after the introductions
were over and the entire football squad
had assembled in the big living-room

  men the coach said seriously make
yourselves comfortable old rod stephens
is going to make you a little talk but
before he begins i want to tell you some-
thing about him rod stephens came to
st andrews a natural-born football player
he was ahvays in condition look at him
now-not an ounce of surplus fat play-
ing football came to him as naturally as
eating and putting on fat comes to some
of you fellows rod was a quarterback
as you all know with him on the field
running the team i could sit back on the
bench and rest easy instinctively he
knew more football than i did when-
ever i had a hard football problem or job
i called in rod he took care of it rod
only failed me once
a pledge redeemed

  cold beads of perspiration broke out on
rodney stephens brow-he had always
suspected that the old coach had known

  that was in the last game of his st
andrews career weinert continued we
were playing baden university the same
team we play tomorrow their entire team
was instructed to get rod stephens well
when the game was about half over they
got him-and we lost the game the old
coach chuckled

  i dont know why i was disappointed
for it took their whole team to finally put
him out he was the greatest football
player i ever had on one of my teams
though maybe he can inspire jack or some
others of you tonight so that ill have to
revise my opinion thats why i want him
to talk to you come on rod-tell us
how its done

  for a moment rodney stephens sat in
a daze of astonishment the denounce-
ment he had expected had not come in-
stead the old coach was holding him up
as a super-player his lips were dry and
stiff as he tried to speak

  men he began i- coach weinert
overestimates me football has changed in
the last twenty-five years it isnt the
same game i once played there isnt any
thing i can tell you except- he faltered
for an instant groping for a way to begin
just as jack and i started out here we
met tim hawkins

  the mention of tim hawkins brought a
frank guffaw from his listeners for an
instant a sharp rebuke hung on rodney
stephens lips but the eager expectant
faces of his audience choked it back un-
uttered instead he threw back his head
and chuckled with them

  im afraid he said slowly that tim
has spoiled his otherwise fine football rec-
ord by talking too much and id hate to
ruin mine that way

  the football squad roared its apprecia-
tion he was telling them what they want-
ed to hear rodney stephens realized this
and deliberately he continued to give them
what they wanted and expected

  i dont know how it happened he
went on but in my time we could al-
ways expect baden university to have a
team which would outweigh us at least
five pounds to the man baden u went
in for choice bottle-fed beef of course
that is their own affair personally im
a firm believer in the old adage the
bigger they are the harder they fall 

the blue



  for five or ten minutes he artfully played
to the vanity and confidence of his audi-
ence there wasnt a single serious over-
tone in his talk he flattered and coaxed
the men before him into a howl of ap-
proval then coach weinert ordered them
all to bed

  in the long hours of the night that fol-
lowed rodney stephens realized that for
the second time in his career he had failed
and when sleep finally came to him it
brought with it the specter of an exulting
dervish whirling and dancing on a pile of
burning logs and shrieking in triumph as
it held aloft a pair of gloves that would
not bum

vwhen the starting-time of the big game
approached on the following day
rodney stephens had had no opportunity
to redeem himself kathleen had motored
out to the country club after breakfast and
taken him in charge under her deter-
mined guidance he had visited classroom
after classroom meeting old teachers and
alumni and keeping himself on exhibit gen-
erally although he had tried to -suggest
to her that these were just the things he
wanted to escape kathleen had instantly
suspected him of not wanting to bore her
with his old friends and had redoubled her
efforts to find more of them

  after their luncheon was over in sheer
self-defense rodney proposed that they go
early to the football stadium and watch the
big crowd assemble

  if you are sure there isnt anyone else
you want to see she agreed reluctantly
im positive rodney sighed

  they arrived at the football bowl just
as the gates were opened kathleen hand-
ed the tickets to the gatekeeper who whis-
tled shrilly for an usher

presidents box rodney heard the
usher instructed -just follow him sir
they were led down a long concrete
ramp to a box on the level of the sod and
directly behind the st andrews bench

  is there anything else sir the under-
graduate usher asked deferentially

  rodney shook his head and thanked him
but as the usher went back to his post he
stopped long enough to whisper to one of
the program boys who rushed over with
two programs outstretched rodney me-
chanically reached in his pocket for change
but the boy would not accept his money

  theyre complimentary to the presi-
dents guests sir he explained shyly
book magazine



 but rodney protested dont you
 have to pay for all the copies you dont
 turn in

 that makes it all the more of an honor
 to give them to you mr stephens the
 boy declared earnestly

when he had gone rodney turned to
kathleen whose eyes were sparkling with
pride and mischief

 young lady he said sternly why in

by homer king gordon

 berly im the one who talks too much
 im afraid

  tims laughing answer was drowned in
some noisy newcomers yells from the top
of the stands the baden university band
came on the field and the crowd rose to
give it welcome during the confusion tim
ambled away

  the st andrews band came on the field
next marching with stiff precise steps

the devil didnt you tell me that we were
going to sit stuck out in the middle of the
field in president campbells box
perhaps i rather wanted to have every-
one see me sitting out here with you she
confessed

  if i could think of a single excuse id
leave you sitting here by yourself he
grumbled no wonder jack didnt let me
have the tickets

  with her face buried in the great arm-
ful of chrysanthemums jack had thought-
fully provided kathleen managed to look
properly contrite and adorable

  tell me about your speech last night
to the football team she requested jack
said it was the best one he had ever heard
the boys all thought it was wonderful
he managed to divert her attention to
something else but he could not check the
bitter memories that her request had
brought surging through his mind a little
later as the crowds jammed in tim haw-
kins came shouting along the aisle and
stopped for a moment

  i heard last night you accused me of
talking too much rod tim said with a
good-natured laugh there was no malice
in the big fellows voice-he took it as a
good joke

  im sorry tim rodney answered so-

until it was abreast of the box where rod-
ney and kathleen sat at a flourish of the
bandmasters baton it swung in toward
the box and came to an abrupt halt two
cheer-leaders sprang up and called for si-
lence

  first came the st andrews football song
followed by nine cheers for the team

  again the yell-leaders called for silence

  heres old rod stephens one of them
shouted lets give him the old-timers
song

  led by the band the rooting section sang
after it was over rodney was forced to
his feet for a bow and then the rooters
gave him nine to acknowledge his bow

  president campbell and his wife entered
the box which was again made the center
of attention but suddenly the stands were
hushed at the end of the stadium two
uniformed attendants were opening the
players gate

  through this entrance a few seconds la-
ter came the st andrews team led by
jack stephens after the team came the
long line of substitutes streaming to the
bench to huddle like so many indians un-
der the blue-and-gold blankets marked with
a golden a while the first team went
through a brief signal practice on the play-
ing field
a pledge redeemed

  the roar and tumult which greeted the
blue-and-gold jerseys of st andrews had
hardly died down when the big team of
baden university charged out from under
the concrete stands

  st andrews kicked off baden received

  as rodney stephens had been in his
day jack stephens was now the offensive
threat of st andrews in addition to the
kicking and running of rodneys time jack
could hurl a forward pass with deadly ac-
curacy as his team waited poised for
the dash down field he dropped back to
kick a second later the ball went spin-
ning toward the far comer of the field
a perfect kick it was high enough to let
his men get down on the baden end who
had received the ball before the inter-
ference could be formed

  look rodney sprang to his feet and
pointed at his son two baden players
had pinned him to the ground and with
a crash a third one flung himself on the
prostrate player as they watched after
his kick jack had been the last st an-
drews man to go down the field the at-
tack on him had been unnecessary made
after the referees whistle had blown it
meant but one thing to rodney stephens
football-trained mind

  theyre trying to take him out he
muttered his fists clenched theyre try-
ing to get him

  jack shook himself free of the three
baden men and trotted backto his de-
fensive position

  he wasnt hurt kathleen laughed re-
lievedly

  twice the big baden team tried to pierce
the st andrews line and twice it was
thrown back for a loss with the ball on
their own fifteen-yard line on the third
down baden elected to kick jack received
the punt and ran the ball back ten yards
before he was downed under a pile of
striped jerseys

  again jack got up sturdily barking sig-
nals as he scrambled to his feet from an
open formation he took the ball himself
on a direct pass from the center and head
down charged through the baden line off
tackle the headlinesman marked up an
eight-yard gain

  he fooled them that time rodney
boasted they thought they had him
scared

  jacks something like his father when
it comes to being scared isnt he miss
kathleen president campbell remarked

the blue

with a smile kathleen nodded proudly

  on the next play the st andrews full-
back made more than the two yards neces-
sary for a first down again jack was
buried under a pile of baden players

  theyre keeping at him kathleen
rodney explained his voice tense theyll
try to hammer him to pieces

  they cant make him quit trying she
declared confidently they would kill
him first

  rodney did not answer he was think-
ing of another baden team it had been
twenty-five years but he could still remem-
ber the way it had pounded him down
after down into final defeat

the first quarter ended with little ad-
vantage to either team after pene-
trating the enemy territory at the start
of the game st andrews had gradually
lost the ground it had gained what ad-
vantage the baden team had in weight was
offset by the greater speed of the st an-
drews warriors as the second quarter
continued it became apparent to the spec-
tators that the fight would be mainly a
question of endurance and stamina or a
lucky break

  such a break came quicker than anyone
expected and with disastrous results to the
hopes of st andrews baden kicked
jack under the shadow of his own goal
might have signaled for a fair catch it
was a long high punt with a twist which
made it dangerous to handle it might
have rolled on out of bounds but the
baden ends were down on him and he
was afraid to let them have a chance to
touch the ball before it rolled over the
line or perhaps have it bounce off at right
angles and be grounded with no gain

  instead he tried to catch the ball and
run it back it was a perfect catch but
his arms had hardly cradled the ball when
a baden end hit him from the right side
driving him against another enemy tackier
from the left a third baden man crashed
into him head on and high the ball flew
from his grasp and rolled across the goal
line into the arms of another baden player

  a touchdown had been made

  jack lay where he had fallen time out
was called finally he staggered to his feet
and called his men into formation but as
the visitors rooting section roared baden
completed the kick that gave them the
additional point

  twice in the few minutes that remained

of the second quarter time had to be called
out for jack stephens each time he got
up a little weaker reeling more and af-
ter each time he went down the big
team made additional gains they were

by homer king gordon

  i hoped you would come the veter-
an coach turned to his team men keep
on with what you are doing but listen

  shoot dad jack invited with a pain-
ful attempt at a grin

men of st andrews rodney said
slowly i have something to teu you

the baden warrior
fled while the st
andrews stands
howled with delight

within ten yards of the st andrews goal
line when the half ended

  there was a marked difference in the
way the two teams left the field baden
trotted off jauntily and confidently st
andrews wearily with heads bowed

  i wonder if hes hurt badly kath-
leens voice trembled

  with his hands clenched in his pockets
rodney stephens stared hard at the field

  the cowards kathleen half sobbed

  wait here kathleen rodrcey com-
manded grimly im going to their dress-
ing-room

  he vaulted from the box and strode off
toward the players gate his ehin thrown
out and his shoulders back totally unmind-
ful of the buzz of comments that followed
his progress across the field

  looks as though history was repeating
itself rod chad weinert said greeting
him with a rueful smile

  scattered about the dressing-room with
its reeking odors of perspiration liniment
and sodden leather were the st andrews
players some resting some in the hands
of rubbers two men were working over
jack who lay stripped on a rubbing-table

  i want to talk to your men chad
rodneys voice was strained and sharp

twenty-five years ago i played my last
game for our old college in that game
eleven men of baden university set out to
get me coach weinert told you last night
that finally they did that isnt true
with his eyes averted and turned away
from his son rodney continued they
didnt get me men i-i quit

  only jacks sharp gasp was audible in
the instants awkward pause that followed

  men rodney confessed simply last
night when i lighted the sacred st andrews
bonfire i made a pledge that id tell you
this before the night was over when i
faced you last night it was with that in-
tention-but i couldnt go through with
it i couldnt bear to humiliate my boy
and his pride in my football fame

  coach weinert made a quick motion to
interrupt but rodney waved him back

  can you realize how the memory of my
yellowness has haunted me for the past
a pledge redeemed



twenty-five years he asked that is
the reason i have never come back i
couldnt bear to face the towers of st
andrews ive lied to jack to keep from
coming-for i was ashamed to come

  with almost a sob of disappointment
jack buried his face in his arms

  when i mentioned tim hawkins last
night i meant to tell you-but you all
laughed and my nerve left me men i
was a bom football player-it came easy
to me tim hawkins was the most awk-
ward man who ever put on a football suit
for four years he endured gibes and jeers
and ridicule but he would not give up
finally he made the st andrews line in my
last big game and men he held his ground
until they carried him off the field with a
broken leg and then he fought to get
back in

  he paused and walked over to the table
where jack lay with heaving shoulders
with one hand on his sons quivering back
he went on

  gentlemen he said quietly it isnt
the loss of a game that matters some one
must lose it is the loss of your self-respect
that counts many a time in the years that
have followed my football days i have been
tempted to lay down i would not have
been blamed men didnt blame me for
quitting the football field when i did even
coach weinert thought i could go no
farther but in my heart i knew better
and ive fought for the men who had faith
in me even after they themselves quit
fighting-and ive come through

  he waited for the significance of his
words to sink into the minds of his lis-
teners

  gentlemen he concluded each one
of you has made a pledge to st andrews
whether you win this game today or
whether you lose it will not affect the honor
of st andrews but men if you go off
the football field this afternoon without
giving everything that it is in you to give
you will have disgraced the sacred name
of your college and in your hearts you will
have left a scar that time cannot heal
will you be able to come back in future
years as tim hawkins comes joyously
happy that he gave all that was in him
for the cause he was pledged to uphold-
or will you come back as i have come
miserably unhappy and ashamed to show
yourselves in the presence of the gray
towers you have failed

  with bowed head rodney turned toward

by homer king gordon

the door his confession done-but jack
blocked his way

  dad-the tears were streaming down
his sons face but his chin was proudly
up-i dont know what happened twen-
ty-five years ago and furthermore i dont
care but i do know that it takes more
nerve than i ever dreamed a man could
have to stand up and say what you have
just told us im prouder of you now
than i have ever been

  with one arm around his fathers shoul-
ders he turned to his team

  men he said grimly dad has put
his finger on- what is wrong with us we
have been trying to lay down ive tried
harder than any of the rest of you ive
just been waiting to be knocked out but
god help the baden man who tries to put
me out when i go back on the field

  the inarticulate growl of men incapable
of speech answered for the team

  now dad jack finished affectionate-
ly go out and tell the whole cockeyed
world to watch us come back

  a warning whistle blew outside the door
and some one announced that the rest
period was up the two teams were lining
up for the third-quarter kick-off when rod-
ney got back to the box

  if you think jacks hurt just watch
him he reassured kathleen

a gain the ball sailed away from jacks
 toe toward the far corner of the field
and as before two baden players came at
the kicker but the results this time were
different head down jack charged at the
larger of the two his impact threw the
astonished baden player clear of the turf
and left him lying senseless on his back
whirling jack flung himself on the second
man who originally rushed down at him
seeking instinctive self-preservation the
baden wariaor turned and fled while the
st andrews stands howled with delight

  that was the way the third quarter
started when the game ended the score
stood twenty-six to seven in favor of st
andrews

  as tim hawkins dragged him on the
field to lead the victorious snake-dance
rodney stephens realized that at last the
chalk-mark against his name had been
erased from the big book of life by
his confession he had found his conscience-
freed soul and his exultant war-whoop was
more than a cry of victory-it was a prayer
of thanksgiving

                      illustrated by l r gustavson

martin ross skipper of the brig-
antine jerjalcon stopped in his pac-
ing of the deck and removed his
pipe from his mouth straining his eyes
into the darkness to starboard he listened
intently

  a mile distant from the jerfalcons an-
chorage twinkled a small cluster of lights
on the crescented shoreline of the lagoon
the night before when the brigantine had
swept through the reef-bound entrance
there had been no lights there but with a
pearler in the roadstead old tsi hung had
removed his shutters and garnished his old
rookery of a dance-hall now across the
still lagoon bursts of revelry came faintly
to captain ross ears he shrugged his
shoulders the boys were entitled to their
blowout after the seven weeks of arduous
toil on the pearling grounds of the gulf

  the night was oppressively hot-little or
no improvement on the stifling day that
had died in tropical haste two hours earlier
the captains eyes traced the dark shore-
line sunk in ragged pitchblack shadows
adamantine in their opaqueness the air
was heavy with the odor of leathery foliage
a sea-blown firefly hummed through the
rigging above his head a slow-moving point
of light whose progress seemed impeded by
the heavy humid atmosphere

  again he listened between the bursts
of revelry his alert ears caught a soft click-
ing sound as of oarlocks moving in their
sockets with stealth he thought then dis-
missed the notion some belated fisherman
returning from the reef with snapper he
decided knocking the ashes from his pipe
he took a turn about the deck to see that
everything wtas snug and tight the crew
on the midnight tide



the blue

would probably not return until daylight
so it was no use staying up for them
ryan the mate would see to it that they
kept reasonably sober steady youngster
ryan hed make a good skipper some
day-no nonsense about him if it hadnt
been for him ross would never have let
them take the surfboat the other boat
had been smashed in a sea off cape york
he hoped the boys would keep their mouths
shut

  it had been a profitable season he re-
flected below hatches there were a hun-
dred and eight-odd tons of shell good
grade heavy and pink-edged worth in the
neighborhood of two hundred dollars a ton
on the wharf at san francisco the small
safe in the chartroom contained some eight-
een thousand dollars worth of pearls that
might attract some of the renegades who
attach themselves like leeches to the cheap
dance-halls of western oceania yes he
certainly hoped the boys would keep their
mouths shut

oing forward he examined the cable
and noted by its tautness that the tide
was running out fast when he craned his
neck over the side he saw two black scimi-
tar-shaped points cleaving the two-knot
current less than ten feet from the bow
of the vessel he shivered the lagoon
of tangu was one of the most notoriously
shark-infested sheets of water under the
southern cross

  he looked to the riding-light trimmed
its wick and adjusted it until it burned
a steady white flame then crossed to the
forehatch where a small canvas-covered
one-man canoe lay bottom up he had
given it its last coat of waterproof paint
during the day touching it with the tips
of his fingers he noted with satisfaction
that the paint was dry

  he smiled softly as he thought of the
cries of delight that would issue from little
marts lips when he saw that canoe ross
had promised him one for his twelfth birth-
day a month hence he had built it him-
self between watches modeling it from a
memory-picture of an eskimo kayak like
the kayak its waterproof compartments
made it unsinkable little mart could
paddle safely and to his hearts content
from one end of san francisco bay to the
other as it would hold only one person
thered be no danger of complications with
the lads other playmates

  ross sighed as he remembered his wifes

words of protest every time the subject of
a canoe came up

  i know what youre trying to do skip-
per-skipper was her term of endear-
ment for him-youre trying to make a
sailor of him and take him away from me
its bad enough to be sitting on telegraph
hill waiting for a husband to stick his head
through the door twice a year have a
heart skipper-he was born web-footed
as it is

  ross didnt blame ellen he supposed
it got pretty lonesome for her at times
she was a good scout and a fine manager
it was her saving and her managing that
had kept him from dry-rotting in a mates
berth and that had enabled him to buy
the jerfalcon three years ago-one-third
cash and a mortgage for the balance this
trip would make it easier though the
pearls in the safe were all velvet with the
proceeds of their sale hed be able to clear
off the balance due on the brigantine which
was mighty lucky the bank had been
fussing about carrying him any longer and
shipping securities were not attractive to
individual investors since the post-war
slump

  but hed be able to take care of the
whole sum now and have enough left over
to pay down on a cottage on euclid heights
in berkeley where ellen could see the fog
roll through the golden gate without hav-
ing to live in it

  there were mighty few women like ellen
he reflected he was lucky all right

  well he would show her how greatly he
appreciated her ross resolved her life
should soon be easier five years more-
if things went well-and hed have another
vessel a sister to the jerfalcon handy rig
the brigantine for these latitudes where
you run before the trade-winds for days
at a time hed hire skippers to run them
and rent himself an office downtown
the ross navigation company would
look fine on a frosted pane and ellen
rolling down at four-thirty in the afternoon
in a closed car with plate-glass windows
and a shasta daisy in a cut-glass vase

  with these pleasant visions in his mind
he went below lighting the cuddy lamp
in his cabin he went into the chartroom
adjoining and gave the handle of the
small safe which hed had built into the
wall and which contained the pearls in
chamois-skin bags a tug or two to assure
himself that it was locked securely then
he went back into his cabin the burn-

ing cuddy lamp raised the already stifling
temperature of the small compartment per-
ceptibly so he undressed quickly

  when he hooked back the door of the
cabin for ventilation he caught sight of
his face in the mirror on the wall and he
grinned at the image he saw reflected
therein-on the pearling grounds there had

water eddying under the brigantines stem
the stealthy tread of bare feet along the
deck did not reach his consciousness at all
so at the words lie still or get this knife
between your ribs he merely opened his
eyes and blinked dazedly at the dark figure
bending over him his eyes traveled to the
knife whose point was pressed against a

been no time for the little niceties of life
his gray eyes twinkled as he wondered
what ellen would say if she could see him
with that seven-weeks growth of reddish-
brown beard

  turning out the cuddy lamp he rolled
into his bunk it was too hot for covers
for a few minutes he lay listening in the
darkness to the southing of the tide under
the open porthole near his head then
overcome by drowsiness and heat he
dropped off to sleep

  sometimes a subtle warning of danger
is transmitted to the sleeping mind bi-
ologists have tried to explain this with
solemn monographs on reflex action traced
back to arboreal ancestry to captain
ross this warning came as he tossed in his
bunk on the borderland between sleeping
and waking the warning was however
not insistent enough to awaken him fully
the sound of muffled oars dipping in the
tide was synchronous with the swish of the

spot on his pajama suit immediately above
his heart then to a second dark figure in
the act of holding a spluttering match to
the wick of the cuddy lamp

  he made an ineffectual grab for the re-
volver under his pillow but the man with
the knife anticipated the move the pistol
fell clattering to the floor

  another move like that and youll be
feeding the sharks the intruder said as
his companion picked the gun up

  ross regarded the two through half-
closed lids the fellow bending over him
with the knife was a white man-at least
his skin was white the rest of his racial
characteristics were blurred by the dregs
of life his small pointed ears hugged the
close-cropped bullet head a pair of black
porcine eyes set much too wide apart
glared at ross from beneath a brow fur-
rowed as if by habitual scowling nouhala
the penal settlement of oceania was only
fifty miles to the west ross knew
on the midnight tide



  the other whose flat nose high cheek-
bones and muddy complexion proclaimed
him a half-caste malay was loose-lipped
vacuous of eye and slight of build he was
also armed with a knife he seemed to be
taking orders from his companion and his
speech was the monosyllabic pidgin-eng-
lish of his breed

  without removing his eyes from ross
face or the knife point from the skippers
breast the white man said to his com-
panion holding out his left hand

  give me the gun

  the half-caste complied and the other
shifted the weapon to his right hand and
stepped back with the muzzle pointed at
ross head replacing the knife in his
belt he reached for the pair of handcuffs
which hung on a nail at the foot of the
bunk they were rusty from disuse for
ross did not believe in strong-arm methods
he had never found it necessary to resort
to handcuffs he had come upon them in
the chartroom locker among a lot of other
odds and ends when he had taken posses-
sion of the vessel three years earlier and
had kept them as a curiosity he wished
now that he had acted upon his first im-
pulse and had thrown them overboard

rthe man slipped one of the steel bands
about ross right wrist and jerked the
skipper to a sitting position

  get up he ordered and if you
know whats good for you you wont try
anything funny he added

  ross slid out of the bunk had the man
been alone hed have taken a chance on
knocking the gun out of his hand and grap-
pling with him but with the two such a
course would be suicide the malays
knife would be buried between his shoulder-
blades in a moment because there was
nothing else to do the skipper suffered
himself to be handcuffed to one of the iron
stanchions by which the bunk was sus-
pended from the ceiling

  the man pocketed the gun and jerked his
thumb in the direction of the chartroom

  the combination of the safe he said
-and be quick about it

  ross stalled for time

  ive forgotten it he lied ryan my
mate has it written down on a piece of
paper hes ashore

  a hairy knobbed fist shot out and
caught him a staggering blow on the
temple

  praps thatll remind you the man

by carl clausen

said kick through or be drilled
through his hand moved toward his
hip pocket from which the handle of the
pistol protruded 

  ross head swam from the force of the
blow a trickle of blood ran down his
cheek and into the comer of his mouth

  im telling you the truth he pro-
tested thickly

  the knotted fist drove through the air
again ross knees sagged at the impact
through vision blurred by purple and scar-
let flashes the lights of tsi hungs dance-
hall mocked him beyond the open porthole

  do i get the combination or do i have
to shoot it out of you the man growled
thrusting his face within a foot of ross
his evil wide-set eyes glittering in the
smoky flare of the cuddy lamp

d oss said nothing his throbbing head
slumped forward against the cool iron
stanchion the loss of the pearls meant
disaster final and absolute five years of
work for nothing and all his savings gone
the cottage on euclid heights an unrealized
dream and worst of all no college for
little mart at a forced sale the jerfalcon
would fetch little above her incumbrance
with freight rates as they were at present
many better bottoms being idle for lack
of charter

  he stared smokily through the porthole
at the mocking lights of tsi hungs also
at something else a rope that moved up
and down within a foot or two of the
aperture to his tortured vision it ap-
peared like a hair laid across the lens of a
telescope it dropped out of sight only
to reappear and pass between him and the
twinkling lights he tried to think what
it could be then it came to him in a
flash

  he heard the voice of his inquisitor as
from a long distance

  praps thisll make you talk

  he glanced down at the knife-point
touching his chest which his assailant had
bared with the wrench of an arm as the
point gashed his skin he merely gritted his
teeth a plan was forming in his mind
but he must not give in too quickly lest
they become suspicious

it became a battle between fortitude and
 avarice between the cunning of the
trapper and the greater cunning of the
trapped whose wits had been sharpened
by desperation again and again the
the knotted fist drove through the air
again ross knees sagged at the impact

needle-like point of the knife seared his
breast bleeding now from half a dozen
shallow gashes the malay half-breed
stood by blinking his long arms dangling
at his loins and his lower lip drooping
askew

  the other drew the knife in a final slash
across ross chest then stepped over to
the cuddy lamp removing the chimney
he thrust the point of the knife into the
flame and held it there until it glowed
red

  thisll make you talk you - he said
between his teeth and he brought the glow-
ing point within an inch of ross cheek

  ill tell cried ross shrinking from the
red-hot metal in feigned terror

  i thought that would make you listen
to reason the other said triumphantly
do your little sum and dont make any
mistake in addition-or youll get well
scorched

  ross called off the numbers

  got a pencil said the other

  theres one in the pocket of my vest
ross told him

  were getting accommodating the
other sneered as he searched the vest
pocket with grimy fingers all right-
read em off again

  ross repeated the five numbers

  im not sure whether the middle one is



six or seven try seven first if it doesnt
work itll be the six

  itd better be one or the other the
man scowled as he jotted the two numbers
down on a slip of paper which he tore from
a calendar on the wall

  it will be said ross we changed
the combination last week ryan put it
down in his daybook hes got it with
him

  the man lifted the cuddy lamp out of
its gimbals and after replacing the chimney
carried it into the chartroom followed by
the malay

i eft alone in the dark captain ross
ll worked fast to carry out his plan hoist-
ing himself to the edge of the bunk he
thrust his right leg through the open port-
hole for what seemed like an age he
groped with his bare foot for the rope
straining to the effort of reaching it twice
his foot touched it it eluded him time
and again but at last he caught it over
his ankle and drew his foot through the
porthole it took careful manipulation to
pull the bight of the rope through the
aperture and keep it from slipping off his
ankle it also took every ounce of his
waning strength to draw his leg up so that
he could get his fingers on the rope

  he accomplished it at last raised it in
on the midnight tide



the blue

his manacled hands and sank his teeth into
it he blessed the fortuitous circumstance
that the three-strand half-inch rope was
old and soft

  he had gnawed one strand through when
he heard a muttered curse from the chart-
room as the man discovered the first com-
bination to be wrong and started on the
second

  the ruse had worked

  as his teeth tore at the second manila
strand he heard the click of the tumblers
and an exclamation from the two as they
ravaged the safe of its precious store he
gnawed through the second strand while
they snarled at each other over the divi-
sion of the spoils

  one minute more and the last strand
parted between his teeth

tie straightened up and let both ends go

   they dropped swiftly out of sight
through the open porthole

  presently the two men returned with the
cuddy lamp each carried in his hand a
small chamois-skin bag half-full of pearls
the white man replaced the lamp in its
gimbals

  you could have saved yourself a lot of
trouble and carving if you hadnt been bull-
headed he told ross you might have
known we meant business good night and
pleasant dreams captain

  he raised his hand in a mock salute
turned on his heel and left with the half-
caste at his heels

  ross heard them mount the companion-
way steps and the clatter of their feet as
they descended the poop ladder to the
deck then silence followed immediately
by exclamations of profanity and excited
pidgin-english ross smiled grimly

  they were back in a moment the big
burly figure of the white man filled the
doorway behind him stood the malay
his muddy face a sickly green in the light
of the swinging cuddy lamp

  our boats gone adrift said the spokes-
man the painter parted wheres your
dinghy

  we lost it in a squall off cape york
ross informed him

  the other drew in his breath sharply
he glowered at ross as if divining that
he had been tricked

  where dyou keep your life-rafts he
demanded

  luggers with a crew of twelve dont
carry life-rafts ross reminded him gently

he was smiling but his gray eyes were
daggers of triumph the man glared at
him balefully and fingered the butt of the
pistol in the back pocket ive a good
mind to plug you for that grin he said

  no doubt said ross only youd
swing from the foreyard when the boys get
back

  the other made a noise in his throat

  any spare sticks we could make a raft
of he demanded

  you might send down the royal and
topgallant yards and ride them ashore
ross suggested only youd have to keep
your feet inboard or youd be wearing
wooden legs for the rest of your lives

  you think youre funny dont you
the other snarled

  im getting a little amusement out of a
unique situation ross admitted modestly
ever hear the story of the lady and the
tiger no well here you are within
a mile of the densest jungle in the western
pacific with eighteen thousand dollars
worth of first-class pearls if you try to
swim the sharksll get you if you stay my
crew will heads i win-tails you lose

  the white mans eyes narrowed to slits
and his fingers closed about the butt of the
pistol ross slowly shook his head

  i wouldnt shoot if i were you kill-
ing me would merely hasten your own de-
mise he remarked youd be dangling
from my yardarms-instead of decorating
the gibbet at the nouhala some nice sunny
morning

  the two men exchanged glances the
chance shot had hit its mark

  too bad the tides going out ross
went on or you might have unshipped
the cable and let us drift as it is wed
be pounded to pieces in the surf in fifteen
minutes he sighed things sure look
black for you boys-at least for one of
you he mused as if by an afterthought

  what dyou mean-one of us the
other demanded coming up close the
malay glided across the threshold with a
soft cat-like tread his black eyes flitted
distrustfully from one to the other of the
two caucasians

  i mean what i said ross retorted
tantalizingly he noted with satisfaction
the stealthy movement of the half-castes
brown hand for the knife in his belt

  one of you can get away with the
pearls the other will have to stay and
face the music-and itll be some dance
tune i can tell you that

  the white man shot his dark-skinned
companion a quick veiled glance out of the
tail of his eye at which the half-castes
hand dropped from the handle of the belted
dagger

  this exchange of looks was not lost
on ross he chose his next words care-
fully seems to me theres nothing left
for you two to do except toss up for it
he said

  suppose you explain the other snarled
im no good at conundrums

  this is no conundrum if two men are
about to be hung and one escapes-well
do your little sum and dont make any
mistake in subtraction he mocked the
yardarm of the jerjalcon swings wide and
free

  stow that necktie talk said the man
with a grimace ive shot myself out of
worse holes than this spill the glad news
-and be quick about it

  for a consideration said ross un-
seeming haste or eagerness would arouse
their suspicion he was playing not for
time but upon their individual cupidity
and upon the strongest of all human in-
stincts self-preservation nevertheless it
was a delicate situation one misstep and
his plan would come to naught the in-
truder regarded him in black silence his
malignant eyes flashing suspicion

  whats your proposition he growled
one eye on his companion who leaned for-
ward as if better to hear

  unshackle me from the stanchion said
ross thats my consideration then
as the other made a wry face he added
you can leave the handcuffs on me if
thatll make you feel any easier

  i see the white man took the hand-
cuff key from his pocket and motioned to
the half-caste

  undo him he ordered curtly tossing
over the key

  stepping back he trained the pistol on
ross his bullet head was thrust forward
and his cruel black eyes glinted along the
barrel

  the malay quickly unfastened ross then
manacled his hands behind at the others
instruction the white man took the key

from the half-caste and tossed it through
the porthole safety first he leered

  instead of answering ross led the way
up the companionway and forard to where
the canvas canoe was lying bottom up on
the fore-hatch the pistol never left the
small of his back for a moment

   help yourself gentlemen he said in-
dicating the skiff

  the two groped for it in the darkness
and turned it over

   as youll note itll hold but one
thats easy said the white man to his
companion ill go ashore and come back
with a boat for you hassan

  but will he come back hassan rqss
said methinks not old socks

  you keep your face out of this before
i change my mind and plug you the
plug-ugly growled at the skipper as he
caught hold of one end of the canoe
come on nigger lend a hand

rjhe half-caste picked up his end of the
canoe and the two carried it to the bul-
warks as the white man bent over to tie
a rope in the painter ring the malay leaped
upon his back like a panther and sank his
knife to the hilt under the left armpit of
the stooping man

  straightening up with a bellow of rage
and pain the white man twisted himself
about and shook his assailant off the
native regained his feet in a moment and
leaped at him again a stab of flame
belched from the right hand of the mor-
tally wounded man it caught the half-
caste square in the chest while he was in
midair the two went down together and
rolled into the scuppers and the gun went
clattering along the deck

   captain ross poked the two still figures
with the toe of his boot manacled though
he was he managed to extract the two
small chamois-skin bags containing the
pearls from the dead mens pockets as
he did so he noted that the malays knife
had ripped a great slit in the canvas bottom
of the canoe

   just a little job for the sailmaker he
remarked philosophically mart old man
you came pretty near losing your kayak

ead sure shes on this evenings
train are you wayne

  stephen wayne boss of the
arnold lode mine turned from watching
the distant blue notch in the canadian
rockies

  dead sure jim he answered young
dorval his loyal tunnel-master she
wired me from winnipeg then from ed-
monton

  he looked again at the blue notch for
the transcontinental was due in the glass
of the station window he glanced once at
his reflection and straightened his soft gray
hat

  the reflection showed a man thirty years
old tall gray-eyed strong of feature
there were tell-tale crowfeet of worry and
overwork beneath his eyes his hands were
acid-stained and his white collar showed
up his dark bronze plainly

  his new tweeds he noted looked all
right but they felt strange he wanted to
be out of them and into his workaday cor-
duroys again he smiled as he recollected
what dorval had said an hour ago at their
cabin

  youve plumb lost the knack of being
leisurely wayne hell who wouldnt-
doing what youve done youll be the
better for a long vacation especially since
itll be your honeymoon you and her are
hyaking into the mountains neppy son
dorval beside him now was smaller of
build and three years younger french
blood showed in his black hair and eyes
and his impulsive ardent nature a col-
lege man from a maritime province he was
waynes subordinate but his partner none
the less

  blee me youre lucky wayne he
mused only the lord knows when ill
be down on this platform waiting for my
train to come in

  you can bring eleanor out this sum-
mer jim the old mine wont stand much
increase in expenses but ill swing you a
decent salary somehow the four of us
will have a hiyu good time together

a round them at the station a little
group had gathered for the event of
the transcontinentals arrival here and
there on the platform one heard the soft

         this splendid novelette by the gifted author of
         the loon lake patrol and red heritage
         deals with a high adventure in the mining
         country of the northwest this is a real story

guttural of the chinook jargon the com-
mon language which french and english
and a dozen indian nations used with one
another

  there were several bewhiskered rag-
gedy old sourdoughs in from the color
creeks for grub and human company a
knot of norski timbermen from the
lumber-camps in the mountains a mounted
policeman talking to a fire ranger a
big powerful indian attistah from the
lost beaver tribe two blackfeet metis
idling in the evening sun-lazy cultus half-
breeds who guided the occasional tourist
and loafed between times a sportsman
with duffle-bags and varnished fishheads
stood waiting for the transcontinental to
whirl him on across the mountains to the
salmon streams of the pacific

  a mere jump-down in the heart of
giant ranges valleria was linked to civi-
lization only by the slender ribbon of steel
no auto-road or wagon-trail could get in
to it canons lakes and tumultuous rivers
barred the way to say nothing of the
mountains

  back of the station was the arnold mine
-a shaft entering a slope a stamp-mill
the houses of the workers and the gaunt
frame residence which old p k arnold had
built on a knoll above the mine towered
the great pine tree lightning-seared but
still stanch where the mine-owner had been
killed four years ago

  hthe story of those four years was a
  story of self-sacrifice and loyalty on
  the part of stephen wayne-loyalty not
  to old arnold but to the person for whom
  he held the property in trust

     at its best the mine was only a poor ex-
  cuse under less able managing it would
  have been closed down and valleria de-
  serted the shaft had tapped only a nig-
  gardly pocket of the rich mother lode the
  parent vein that gave color to the creeks
  and had baffled a generation of prospectors
  lay elsewhere hidden in the wilderness of
  mountains

     though he knew little himself about min-
  ing old arnold was shrewd enough to know
  a good engineer when he saw one recog-
  nizing waynes genius he had given over
  the reins even before his death and speci-
  fied in his will that wayne was to be man-
  ager of the mine

     when he might have been using his abili-
  ties elsewhere at a salary of his own nam-
  ing wayne had taken the burden on his
  shoulders and sacrificed the most precious
  years of his life in keeping the mine alive
  for if it closed down nancy arnold would
  be penniless and he was the only man
  capable and willing to take the job

    the memory of those two sunlit years
  between his coming to valleria and nancys
  going east to school just before her fathers
  death had made that sacrifice a cheerful
  one for wayne he had lived largely in
  
the arnold legacy

the expectation of her return of the mo-
ment just ahead of him now

  there was nothing of the father in the
girls make-up sweet-souled candid and
laughter-hearted-wayne often had thought
that her mother must have been like her
and had been crushed by the dour nature
and hard-handed rule of arnold

  from the first a friendship was struck up
between the girl of seventeen and the young
engineer as she grew into young woman-
hood the comradeship deepened into some-
thing more powerful and fundamental
they never mentioned it to each other
never gave the old roman excuse to
thunder his disapproval at them though
he must have seen their intimacy

  even when she leftj their engagement
was unspoken she was very young
wayne was the first man to make a pro-
found impression on her he considered it
unfair to bind her with a promise before
she had been able to compare him with the
other men she would meet

  only jim dorval and hyacinthe the of-
fice manager knew how wayne had la-
bored those four long years to keep nancys
property for her he had taken no wages
for himself the mine simply would not
stand it there had been times when the
ghost had not walked for the workers and
they stuck only out of loyalty to their boss
till he could pay them again the fear
that the vein would run out haunted him
constantly he was handicapped by a poor
mill and poor shaft-equipment tied down
by lack of money and by the strict in-
junctions of the arnold will

  massive and dominating in his lifetime
old arnold had tried to rule on after his
death his will minutely regulated the
policies of the mine and dictated this and
that to its superintendent for all his
punctiliousness about it the legacy that he
left was destined to work evil debts
sullen tempers among the workmen a mine
struggling to keep up and a superhuman
task for the man who took up the burden

  what other things of evil there were in
old arnolds legacy wayne could not even
guess he had spen only that portion of
the will which related to himself and the
property

mancy knew nothing about the situation
  at the mine her father had known
little enough about the true nature of the
lode preferring his own opinion to waynes
report he had kept his daughter in com-

the blue

plete ignorance about the mining opera-
tions for his philosophy of womans place
was summed up in the word household

  wayne himself had not written her the
truth he did not want to cast a shadow-
over her care-free years at school to her
a gold-mine meant something tremendously
rich she did not understand why the
checks she received were often meager

  several times in her letters to wayne
she had wondered about it and once had
written rather sharply asking the reason
one of her summer trips to europe had
almost foundered the mine and turned
valleria into a ghost camp

  but that was all past now the ore-
bearing vein had taken a notion to widen
suddenly into a respectable size the as-
say-sheet was looking up the workmen
were getting good wages the last debt
had been lifted in may and nancy was
coming back that evening

in the blue notch ten miles eastward a

  black smoke-streamer rose up above the
forest and faded against the sky wayne
watched it intently unconscious of jims
words or the stir upon the platform

  in a few minutes the transcontinental
came in sight down the tracks the rails
began to sing at the platform-edge the
old station-master wigwagged the signal
that he had a passenger going west the
long train thundered into valleria and
stopped the sportsman got on

  waynes heart stopped pounding-till he
caught sight of a girlish figure tripping
down the steps a coach away he hurried
to meet her dorval following discreetly

  he had told himself that the four years
since the day they bade each other klah-
owya had necessarily changed her but he
was hardly prepared for so utter an altera-
tion as he saw in that moment of their
meeting she seemed so like a stranger that
he hardly knew how to greet her

  she was a woman now she had grown
more beautiful more alluring than the
nancy he had known she had learned
how to make the most of her lithe grace-
ful form of her light brown hair and blue
eyes and features exquisitely molded her
mere traveling clothes trim and jaunty
were a dozen times prettier than any she
had ever worn before she had gone east
her very manner was different the frank
open-heartedness of the girl who had left
f iur years ago was changed to a calm
poise and reserve
book magazine

  she smiled when she saw him and gave
him her gloved hand her word of greet-
ing seemed studied her smile artificial and
cold but in another moment when he
clasped her hand the feeling of estrange-
ment vanished for him four years and all
the change they possibly could bring about
meant nothing against his affection

  in waynes oblivion to everything but



 by william byron mowery

men looked into each others eyes at leveled
gaze a faint shadow of a smile played
on tregors lips he had seen waynes
emotion he knew the reason there was
a hint of triumph in his smile

 they shook hands and greeted each
other courteously but the glance they ex-
changed was a declaration of war

  jim stepped up and was introduced he

nancy he did not notice that a second
person had come down the steps behind
her he was aware of it only when she
withdrew her hand and turned half facing
each of the two men

  mr wayne i would like you to meet
mr tregor

  for some reason the words jarred wayne
as if he had been struck a blow he looked
at the man standing beside her a stranger
of his own age and build a handsomely
dressed man with quick intelligent eyes
and an air of polished politeness

  he turned bewilderedly to nancy his
glance a question about the stranger she
understood

  mr tregor is a friend of mine mr
wayne

  a friend he caught the inflection be-
hind the word the stress of her voice
meant something more than friendship be-
tween her and the stranger who had come
with her to valleria

  it dazed him not a hint had she
dropped in her letters he was no man
of granite to take so unexpected a blow
without flinching he looked from one to
the other of them aware that he was be-
traying his surprise but utterly unable to
hide it

  id like to shake hands tregor said
politely with the man whom nancy has
mentioned so many times

  mechanically wayne took the hand ex-
tended to him as they shook the two

i would like
you to meet mr
tregor the
words jarred
wayne as it he
had been struck

too saw how the land lay his acknowl-
edgment of tregors greeting was so brief
and terse that nancy looked at him
sharply frowning

the transcontinental pulled out leaving
the four of them standing together the
little group of onlookers a few paces aside
wayne felt he had to say something

  i had the house put in shape for you
nancy i hired a couple of servants too
youll probably want to go up right now
she nodded

  i suppose theres something that passes
for a hotel here tregor asked

  yes but its not much if you want to
you can stay with dorval and me we
have a cabin at the edge of the lake

  oh that would put you to bother
tregor refused ill tackle the hotel
here you smoky-

  at the gesture the beaver indian
stepped forward tregor extended a dollar
bill and pointed to the grips

  take them to the hotel

  the indian drew himself up and haugh-
tily wrapped his narkin around his shoul-
ders he looked at the money scorn-
fully insulted by the epithet and the offer
alike on the portage path in the wilder-
the arnold legacy

ness he would carry a heavy load a mile
for half of that dollar in the white mans
town he was too proud to stir a finger

  jim grinned at tregors sad mistake

  ill take a couple you a couple he
suggested picking up the two heaviest
none of these men have to let signs up

  wayne knew it was jims adroit move to
leave him alone with nancy in courtesy
tregor could not refuse he picked up his
other grips nodded and caught up with
jim wayne ordered the two breeds to
take her baggage to the arnold house he
and nancy followed

pespite the four years nancy seemed
to have little to say they left the
station passed the fur-trading store the
land-office a timber-yard the dozen houses
that valleria comprised started up the
path to the arnold house before she spoke
and then it was a comment on the weather

  june is a beautiful season here mr
wayne always at this time ive been
homesick for valleria-the lake and the
ranges

  mr wayne he had just called her
nancy it was a plain hint she did not
wish him to use the intimate name he
looked away out over shimmering lac
valleria and wondered if he were not
dreaming it all

  nancy was speaking again she must
have known what he expected at her re-
turn she must have seen his painful be-
wilderment at the station and realized
what tragic irony her homecoming had been
for him as if reading the questions in his
mind she began telling him something
about tregor subtly explaining her rela-
tions with him wayne listened

  he gathered that tregor was a mining
engineer like himself member of a college
faculty but with practical field experience
too she had met him two years ago when
he was lecturing at an eastern university
he had been acquainted with her father
he wanted to look over the mine-and
visit there awhile-and-

  wayne waited for her to say frankly that
she was engaged to tregor the question
throbbed in his mind but nancy had
learned how to dissemble she veiled her
thoughts and emotions from him

  another strange thing in her attitude
he felt as they walked up the path that
she was deliberately steeling herself against
him she would not speak about their
two years of comradeship she would not

the blue

assume or let him assume that the pre-
vious intimacy had ever existed

  when he tried to remind her of it or to
call up that intimacy out of the past she
quietly interrupted with some remark not
fraught with danger

  her coldness might be due partly to
tregors influence but that would not ex-
plain it all surely she was too just to
listen to malicious whisperings perhaps
she was trying to show him from the start
that she loved tregor now but why did
she not openly say so and why was she
on her guard

  at the stone gateway she stopped

  mr tregor wants to look over the mine
tomorrow morning mr wayne ill see
you again then

  after all those years she would not in-
vite him in and talk a few moments at
least

  im rather tired she explained seeing
his dismay

  standing against the gateway lilacs that
were a frame to her girlish body and love-
liness of feature she brought back in vivid
incarnate form the yesteryear when their
affection had been mutual though he
stood watching her as she went up the
steps and entered her old home she did
not look back

chapter ii

at the cabin jim was sitting head in
hands on his bunk in a brown mood
in the boarded-off kitchen the chinese
cookee was shuffling about getting supper

  one corner of the cabin was fitted up
with stone chemical table electric furnace
and other apparatus in their spare time
wayne and jim worked out the weekly as-
say-sheets for the mine lacking money to
keep a professional man they had been
forced to do it

  jim looked up when wayne entered for
several minutes neither man spoke

  say something wayne for heavens
sake jim burst out

  what is there to say

i guess theres nothing-nothing that
would do any good did she tell you any-
thing about their plans to get married
married good god was she really en-
gaged to tregor

  he wet his dry lips she told me
nothing jim

  well tregor dropped a remark to me
book magazine

by william byron mowery

meant hed be staying at the bush ritz
till he and nancy go to victoria in july
its going to be

  wayne caught desperately at a slender
hope

  he might have said that for my benefit
jim

  hows that

  to make me believe im frozen out al-
ready im fighting-till i see theres no
use

  jim ground a cigarette under his heel

  i wonder if old polonius could have
had anything to do with this affair
how so he was always friendly to
me liked me he never said anything
when he saw nancy and i were going to-
gether a lot he left the whole works here
in my hands even to attorney power over
the money you cant put the blame on
him its her choice

  ive seen raw deals jim said angrily
but nothing to compare with this one
there was no promise between us jim
i left her free

  but good lord look at these four
years three different times you could
have gone out on a whopper of a salary
or you and i could have free-lanced and
made a killing somewhere instead of that
you stuck here slaved like ten men didnt
even take mill-hand wages kept that
damned old rock-quarry running for her
sake

  then she comes back and says meet
my friend mr tregor if she doesnt
know what youve done for her she ought
to be told and im willing to tell her
youll tell her nothing jim i want
you to promise that here and now

  why not

  it would put her under obligation to
me if she knew the truth shed feel she
had to marry me as part of a bargain i
made the sacrifice on my own hook with-
out her asking me to ive got no lien on
her jim shes free to make her choice
shes got to remain free

  jim thought it over scowling

  i guess youre right he said slowly
i cant see any way around your argu-
ment itd be forcing her hand and you
wouldnt want her that way ill promise

wfhen nancy and tregor came up to
the mine the next morning at ten
oclock wayne was busy with a knotty
problem at the mercury-distil retort he
quit the job at once

  nancys hand lay lightly on tregors
arm as if she meant him to be her escort
but wayne meant otherwise his fighting
blood was up in her estrangement toward
him in the coldness of her blue eyes he
realized that he was faced with a more
bitter fight than ever the mine had given
him

  well begin at the beginning he sug-
gested taking her by the arm and leading
her toward the tunnel mouth

  they went back into the shaft to its
three-pronged head and watched the stone-
hogs drilling they came out again fol-
lowing three ore-carts and watched the
rock-breakers grind and crunch the lumps
of hard rock to fragments the size of a
walnut following the overhead traveler
that took away the crushed ore they passed
next into the stamp-room

  one battery of five seven-hundred-pound
hammers at twenty strokes each minute
was beating out its monotonous heavy
rhythm crushing the rock-fragments to
powder beneath the mighty blows the
overhead traveler delivered a constant
stream of rock to the stamp-head a high-
pressure spray of water played upon it
between strokes every half-minute a rock-
er-arm tripped up and a tiny batch of mer-
cury fell under the hammer to amalgamate
with the free gold of the powdered rock
from the inclined plane of each stamp-
head a trough with deep copper riffles led
away in these sluices the heavy amalgam
was caught to be removed at intervals

  at the other five-unit battery dorval
with a gang of men was hard at work fitting
new iron shoes beneath the heavy ham-
mers he did not stop his work or look up
though the men nodded respectfully to their
boss

  he led them lastly to the mercury-distil
retort and explained to nancy the final
step in extracting the pure gold he had
found out already that tregor was no tyro
at the business he was quick and shrewd
to size up the mine he smiled at some of
the queer contraptions which wayne and
dorval had rigged up in lieu of costly
machinery he made several sensible sug-
gestions here and there for minor changes

  if his manner had been a little less con-
fident and masterly or if he had uttered a
word of praise for the mines efficiency
wayne would have respected him more

  well go to the office now he bade
wayne i want to see the assay-sheets
and the statements
the arnold legacy



  he demanded it as coolly as if he were
owner of the mine asking a subordinate
for an accounting

  in the office wayne met something which
angered him all through his office man-
ager frank hyacinthe had always seemed
to him loyal enough-inclined to snoop a
bit in other peoples affairs but efficient
with his work and a valuable man this
morning however he gave his superintend-
ent a cool nod but bowed and scraped to
tregor

  it was easy enough to see through hya-
cinthe he was looking out for his own in-
terests he had seen how the land lay and
who probably would be his future boss

   at tregors request he bustled about like
the sycophant he was bringing the assay-
sheets the quarterly balance and the wage
ledger

while tregor was glancing through
 them wayne drew nancy aside
they stood at a window looking out over
lac valleria to the snow-capped range ris-
ing from its western shore from the
window one could count thirty snowy peaks
along the western range and four glaciers
reaching their ice fingers down toward
timberline leagues of primitive forest-
fir and cedar and hardwoods-stretched to
the horizon in every direction

  a shaft of sunlight streaming through
the skylight glowed on nancys brown hair
the softened silhouette of her forehead
lips and throat was maddening poignantly
wayne remembered the time just before
she left when he and she darted across the
lake in a birch canoe and climbed the high-
est peak coming back in the twilight of
the long june day

  he reminded her of that day and
watched her intently she would not look
at him as she answered

  i dont remember it mr wajme

  nor the ring i cut from a birch marl
and put on your finger

  no

  she did remember no girl would have
forgotten that day it had been his most
precious memory during those four lonely
years she was deliberately ignoring that
past intimacy out of existence

  she led the talk to her father-a safe
enough subject her attitude there was a
thing to marvel at a wider acquaintance
with men should have opened her eyes to
her fathers real nature but instead his
tragic death and the perspective of years

the blue

had built up an ideal more powerful than
she had held for him alive

   it was like her notion of the mine itself
she thought it a thing of gold when it
was little better than a hard-rock quarry

  in a way wayne understood why she
cherished the ideal she had been mother-
less for more than eighteen years she
had been under the dominance of her
father where a son would have rebelled
against his overlordship the daughter had
accepted it he had been the most power-
ful influence of her life in the light of
that her reverence and idealization were
understandable

  that ideal must be shattered some day
just as her ideal of the mine was certain
to be

   tregor stepped across to them finally
you probably dont want to listen to
tiresome business details miss arnold
when you can be looking at a scene like
that if you dont mind mr wayne and
i will talk for a few minutes

  she nodded wayne went with her to
the desk

  if your assay-sheets are anywhere near
correct wayne youve been ietting a lot
of valuable by-products go to waste around
here

  how about the equipment to save them
it costs money that the mine hasnt got
you could have borrowed it the prod-
ucts would have repaid it twice over
borrow on what i couldnt raise a
nickel on that vein besides being poor
stuff it might be exhausted any day you
know the truth about this gold-mine now
as well as i do

   tregor tossed the assay-sheets aside and
picked up the wage ledger his intentions
were plain enough he was trying to find
some issue where they deadlocked he
wanted to show who was boss now of the
arnold mine

  at the top of the wage ledger was
stephen wayne superintendenta row
of zeros streamed across the page broken
at rare intervals by entries of twenty or
thirty dollars tregor paused a moment
his pencil on that line

   i suppose that posting is fact wayne
you might ask hyacinthe he handles
all the money

  but why tregor queried his pencil
pointing to the zeros

  wayne looked up and met his searching
stare tregor knew that the mine had been
quivering on the brink of bankruptcy and
book magazine

that a decent salary for its superintendent
might have shoved it over he knew also
why that salary had been turned back dur-
ing the four years

instead of showing a man-to-man esteem
for the sacrifice tregor was grinning about

 

by william byron mowery

flatly while im superintendent here
wages stay where they are

  the deadlock had come

  tregor got up stepped over to nancy
and brought her to the desk wayne rose
to face the crisis

im sorry to bother you miss arnold
tregor said politely but mr wayne and
i have had a little disagreement you own
this mine i believe the decision lies with
you wayne you can state your case
that wont take long wayne answered
bluntly ive been here six years i know

that wage-sheet has to be clipped it means
a thousand dollars more profit a month

it his flaunt his air of triumph destroyed
the last vestige of waynes respect for him
but why he repeated

  you might ask nancy arnold wayne
whipped back unless youre afraid to
let her know the truth im not ashamed
of that page

  tregor went quickly to his next point
youre paying your workmen at least
ten per cent higher wages than the average
mine

  and theyre doing me ten per cent more
work than the average crew

  you cant prove that-

  besides its only decent treatment after
the way they stuck by me take a look
at last decembers posting they didnt
get paid for six weeks

  the point is-tregor tapped the desk
-most of them are married and live here
theyll have to take the cut if any man
doesnt keep up to his present standard he
can be fired off the job that wage-sheet
has to be clipped it means a thousand
dollars more profit a month

  i dont agree to that wayne said

all my men personally i think theyre
getting no more than they earn i could
argue an hour and not say more than just
that its a matter of opinion it boils
down he added pointedly to nancy to
a question of whose opinion is the more
valuable in your estimation

  nancy would not meet his eyes she
looked away from him out of the window
shrinking probably he thought from an
unpleasant thing-from a stark face-to-
face decision

  she was saved the pain of deciding then
and there the office door flung open
dorval hurried in

  theres a hung charge in the tunnel
head wayne the men are afraid to
tackle it cant any ore come out till we
fire the cussed thing

  wayne waited a moment for nancy to
make her decision but she did not speak
unmistakably she felt a glad relief

  i know you want time nancy he re-
marked picking up his hat shall i
come to your house this evening and hear
what youve decided
the arnold legacy

j

  she shook her head tregor grinned
covertly at him as he turned to follow jim
out

  all that afternoon the scene in the office
and the question of nancys choice
throbbed in waynes mind he wanted to
tear himself away from work and find out
what she had decided but he was needed
at the mill whatever his own personal
troubles it had to hammer on

  while the drillers sat back at a safe dis-
tance and smoked superintendent and tun-
nel-master labored for five hours at the
ticklish job of firing an unexploded nitro
blast a single slip or the unexpected
would have meant the death of both when
they succeeded near quitting-time that
evening wayne sent jim to the cabin he
himself started for the mercury-distil to
finish that job so the retort could be heated
the next day

  at the stamp-room door he ran into a
group of men spelling out a bulletin tacked
up that afternoon their faces were long
they had no friendly greeting for him he
stepped up and read the typewritten sheet

  above nancy arnolds signature was a
notice that after the fifteenth of june wages
would be reduced ten per cent

t ate that evening when the twilight was
 changing into deep darkness wayne
found his way up the slope to the lightning-
seared pine on the knoll he sat down at
its massive foot and leaned against its
shaggy deep-seamed bark

  a thought flashed across his mind he
was like that tree-sorely stricken in its
prime of life desperately struggling to keep
its vigor and raise its arms aloft in defiance
of the elements

  the stars were dancing on the bosom of
lac valleria there was a light in nancy
arnolds room the room that he himself
had made ready for her the stamps had
quieted down the mine slept from the
flags at the lake edge came a chorus of
better-go-rounds and shrill knee-deeps
farther out a red-throated loon gibbered
its weird night cajl

  on the lone pine knoll he seemed to be
lifted up out of the tumult of emotions that
had surged through him down below he
had found what he came seeking-the balm
of a cool and quiet and lonely spot he
could think again and see things clearly

  the last twelve years went past in solemn
file only in two of them the years of
comradeship with nancy arnold had he

the blue

been happy there were the bleak memo-
ries of his childhood back in the little
kootny mining town-of his father drink-
ing himself to death after his mother had
run away with another man though he
did not excuse his fathers weakness wayne
could understand now what his grief must
have been

  there were the rough years in the mine
and timber cruise before he climbed out
of the dark and caught the vision of a
brighter higher life then restless ambi-
tion the three brief years of sailing through
the mining course at eugene his early
work at the stamps around juneau the
growing admiration of his brother-en-
gineers the brilliant prophecies they made
about him

  his inspection trip to valleria his meet-
ing nancy his fateful decision to stay
there

  at juneau he would have been a part-
owner by now and consulting expert for
a dozen mines there was no self-esteem
in that thought it was sober fact he was
poorer by several thousand dollars than
when he came money meant nothing it
was the precious wasted years that hurt
he had laid them as a sacrifice at a girls
feet she seemed to him now like a beauti-
ful melody that suddenly has taken on a
tragic motif

  toward midnight he heard some one
coming up the slope he knew it was
dorval before a voice called through the
darkness his partner sat down beside
him

  i thought id find you up here jim
said after a few moments ive come here
myself when things were blue

  why jim wayne remarked sardoni-
cally things arent blue now the mine
is looking right up these days well be
able to finance their honeymoon in grand
style

  i didnt mind working for nancys sake
partner jim went on i often thought
what a time we four would have together
when nancy got back and i could bring
eleanor out what hurts me worst is
tregorll get the benefit of all weve done
it must be that old polonius ghost is
stalking around here ordering things so
that nobodyll be guilty of being happy
i cant see how else this could happen

  but its happened wayne he added
ive been thinking about it for two hours
and i can look it in the eye tregor has
got nancy and i cant bring eleanor out

this summer the only thing left is our
partnership and the future

  were free now to tackle the job weve
been talking about for three years sup-
pose we do fail at that then well hit
across to juneau or up the cassiar weve
got the whole footstool to roam over you
cant stay here-after that notice on the
mill door the quicker you get away and
begin to forget the better itll be for you
youll find yourself quicker out in the
woods shall i go down and pack the
canoe

  wayne took his eyes from the solitary
light in the arnold house down below

  i want a few minutes longer here alone
partner he said slowly

  jim vanished down the dark path
wayne sat silent there a little longer into
his mind flitted an expressive phrase from
the chinook-kopet kumtux-to cease to
know to blot a thing out of memory as if
it had never been in one hour he could
not forget her his love was the strong
mature passion of six long years the
most he could do was to realize that he had
lost her and resolve to forget

  he got up presently his eyes on the light
down below but his mind back in a dark-
ened cabin in the kootny years ago

  if you were here dad he said husk-
ily you would tell me to put her out of
my life and go ahead with a mans work
it is good advice anything else would
lead-lead where your path took you if
i have strength i will forget her

  at the cabin jim met him

  everything is ready for us to start
wayne i knew what youd decide

  they went down to the landing below the
cabin the canoe slipped out of the moon
shadow of the shore hemlocks and pointed
up the lake toward the mountains

chapter iii

hphirty-seven miles north they glided
a ashore the next morning just after
daybreak and made camp at the mouth of
a little canon

  they set up their mosquito-proof tent
built a small stone furnace at the flap-front
lopped off a few spruce limbs to spread
blankets on and dug a basin where a
trickle of water came out at the foot of
the ledge

  while jim was fitting a rod together to
whip some bass out of the shore flags

wayne glanced through the pack and found
his bird-glasses of the hundred things
which his partner might have brought in-
stead the glasses were what wayne wanted
the most always thoughtful jim had
guessed his sore need of being alone and
quiet in the mossy woods

  thereafter jim quietly took care of camp
and cooked the meals very wisely he
tried no hollow comforting he spoke
little and did not once mention the pur-
pose that had brought them there wayne
was thankful for his silence

  he set himself grimly to the battle he
must put his love for nancy completely be-
hind him he must deliberately extinguish
every spark of affection for her

  there were black hours when he thought
he could never shuffle off his love for
nancy there were times when he had to
meet and conquer the weakness that his
father had fallen to times when the temp-
tation to go back to valleria to be near
and see her was almost more than he
could bear

  each morning while the chitter squirrels
were still on their den trees and a smoke
curled up from the lake water he stalked
away from camp like a ghost in the gray
light and headed back into the lonely
mountains through the long twenty-hour
day sometimes through day and night to-
gether he wore out his powerful body by
merciless roaming so that rest would be
welcome

  some days found him threading the stair-
step mountain streams where the water -
ouzel fed in the depths of boiling cascade
pools other times found him above
timberline in snow-fields where the gray-
crowned leucosticte nested and the golden
eagle had his eyrie

  siam-siam the grizzly lumbered past
him in the mossy forest crashing off when
it caught his scent deer flushed in front
of him and glanced into cover of the near-
est buckbrush above timberline he saw
the big horn pasturing his seraglio on the
heather terraces while hyas piisspuss the
panther licked his chops on a ledge above
them

  wayne watched himself as if he were
some impersonal thing analyzing the sub-
tle powerful influence which the wilderness
had on him in strange bird and flower
there was a moments distraction a certain
cheerfulness in the warblers song but the
big influence lay deeper than that

  with his own life at a standstill and his
the arnold legacy

world turned upside down it came home
to him how steadfast nature was-one
certain inexorable thing in a universe of
uncertainties day after day taking storm
and sunshine alike she marched along with
mighty tread in the face of that stead-
fastness his own grief seemed small and
inconsequential he should go on with a
mans work fulfill his destiny turned
aside by neither sorrow nor gladness

  gradually his restless energy began to
awaken his body toughened again the
signs of overwork and worry left him six
years seemed to roll off his shoulders now
that he was free from the arnold mine he
no longer sat out the brief nights at the
lake edge alone he went hunting and
fishing with his partner and laughed again

chapter iv

a fter three weeks of camping at the
canon mouth dorval judged that the
time had come one morning at break-
fast he broached the purpose which had
brought them to that particular spot

  they were setting themselves to a quest
which had baffled a score of engineers and
roving prospectors both of them were
well equipped for the job bringing a work-
ing knowledge of geology and chemistry
and other sciences to the task they were
by easy odds the best pair of men who ever
had tackled the problem and they were
true prospectors in believing they would
win where others had lost

  suppose we sail into it today wayne
  im ready

  ive scouted around a bit this last week
the canon walls are nice to work on and
i located a couple of bad landslips that
read like a book

  did you find the formation were look-
ing for

  thats the trouble i found it every-
where it comes right up the east range
if it occurred only in a couple of places we
could try em out but theres a fourteen-
foot stratum of hard rock covering that
formation we cant dig many holes
through that

  did you find any iron jim

  not a trace anywhere whats the
idea of iron

  well iron lies just under the gold vein
at the arnold mine and at a few other

the blue

old ones that are deserted im guessing
it does up here too

  that doesnt do us any good jim
commented if the iron lies under the
gold wed have to find the gold first any-
way

  the point is jim we cant go digging
into these rocks every few jumps theres
fifty square miles of country here
wed locate that lode only by a cliechahco
miracle and miracles are poor things to
bank on weve got to locate that vein by
sinking three or four holes at most the
iron will help us do that

  if you wont laugh before we give it a
fair trial ill tell you an idea ive been
thinking over an old sourdough across
at treadwell told me about it i thought
it was a plumb pelton idea at the time but
since then ive seen several instances where
it seemed to hold water

  shoot

  wayne explained

  it surelee sounds crazy jim com-
mented but if you say so well give it
a good solid crack

  they buckled on their light tump-packs
took blankets and a few cooking things
and set out up the canon

  in the next week they returned only once
to camp for eighteen hours each day
they kept hard at work stopping to fish
and cook when they got hungry and sleep-
ing wherever darkness found them

  their first step was to chart a strip of
country five miles wide and ten miles long
lying along the eastern shore of the lake
they marked in the canons hills streams
and formations with these twenty sheets
to work on they started up at the north
end of the strip and began jotting down
on the maps the signs which wayne had
said to look for each sign was repre-
sented by a dot

  when they had finished that job and
came back to camp wayne spread the
sheets on the moss and pinned them to-
gether in the right order

  on the five-by-twenty strip of paper he
had a birds-eye view of the whole territory

  the map all over was thickly sprinkled
with the sign dots but half a mile back
from the lake and paralleling its shore
ran a narrow path where the black dots
were markedly heavier the strip was too
clear-cut and decisive to be the work of
chance

  jim lighted a cigarette and eyed the
path of the black dots meditatively
book magazine

  gosh wayne looks like there might be
something to that pelt on idea of yours

  wayne pointed his rifle-barrel to a spot
four miles below their camp the black
dots there were heaviest of all nearly fifty
to the square inch and another path of
them crossed the main one there at right
angles

back to the new camp with a hand drill
a box of dynamite and some news

  theres something wrong down at the
old mine wayne only one batterys been
running for the last five days the drillers
are working only the left tunnel

  maybe the crew is sore about the wage
cut

he clambered out and studied the specimen
coldi dorvul spluttered excitedly

  well cooley down and have a look-see
at that place jim it got me interested
while i was mapping it

  they slept a couple of hours gathered
their digging tools and canoed down the
lake the spot which wayne had in mind
was seven hundred yards inland up a
gentle heavily wooded slope

  within a bowshot a dozen englemann
spruces were blasted by lightning a giant
pine standing just above the spot had been
completely shattered by the bolts

  that tree proves lightning does strike
twice in the same place jim observed
and if we find iron down below here ill
believe the theory that other things being
equal a lightning path follows an iron-
vein

  they sunk a hole through a foot of
woods humus three feet of glacial loess and
a foot of soft shale down to the hard rock
beneath they knocked out a sample of
this to determine what formation it be-
longed to then they trooped a few hun-
dred yards south to a canon along whose
walls they could read the story of what
lay under that first rock stratum

  they found the stratum to be twelve
feet thick the formation they sought
which sometimes carried the precious vein
of gold-ore lay just beneath it

  all the signs were right all pointing at
that one innocent-looking spot but wayne
snubbed his soaring hopes and tried to
keep jims excitement within bounds

  well move the camp down here he
directed ill do that while you hyak
down to valleria and fetch up the dyna-
mite and drill

  the next morning at daybreak jim came

  no most of em are tied there as
tregor said theyll have to take what
he gives em its something else

  its none of our concern whatever the
trouble is wayne rejoined

  and another thing jim added a
canoe followed me up the lake-stayed
about three miles behind i thought sev-
eral times that it was dodging in and out of
the bays keeping out of my sight

  you must be needing sleep son be-
fore anyone steals our gold-mine well have
to find it better tie into this breakfast
and sleep a cord or two so you can lean
heavy on the drill while youre doing
that ill go up and clean off some top
soil

  at noon he went down awakened jim
and they took the dynamite and drill up
to the digging the light rotary shamm
sank very slowly in the hard diabase by
night they had put down seven holes
spooned them out and were ready to plant
the charges
the arnold legacy



the blue

  the first blast the next morning took
them down eight feet their second late
that afternoon took them down to the for-
mation they sought

  before the dirt and powdered rock had
fallen they were in the hole digging away
the debris wayne suddenly picked up a
reddish fragment broken loose from the
bottom he clambered out of the pit to
a ray of sunlight and studied the specimen

  gold dorval spluttered excitedly

  maybe maybe silver too it looks
like the ore down at the old rock quarry
but how rich thats the question be-
fore we cut any claim-stakes well find out
if this vein has any size to it and then
assay the stuff

at different places along the slope they
sank four other holes to determine the
extent and thickness of the vein

  jim summed up the results in his im-
pulsive way

  blee me if she assays worth a whoop
wayne shell be one of the richest finds
between the cariboo and the porcupine

  wayne laid his plans as they walked back
to camp with a tump-pack of specimens

  you go down jim and bring up the
assay outfit ill stay here and keep an
eye on things weve got no juice up here
so youll have to sneak an ox torch out of
the mine to heat the crucible nils an-
dersen will let you have it and wont spread
any word go in and out as quietly as
you can if you leave right now you can
get there and away during the dark
theres some stray characters hanging
around valleria that i dont cotton to
watch your step

  when jims canoe had disappeared down
the lake wayne fished for a short while
then sauntered up to the diggings he
had warned jim not because he really
suspected anything was wrong but merely
to guard against the one possibility in a
thousand but at the pit below the blasted
pine he ran across a token that made him
throw his rifle into his hand and glance
around sharply in the shadowy woods

  in the fresh loam at the pit edge there
was a mans track-a narrow pointed-toe
dress shoe

  he and jim were wearing blunt heavy
brogans

  it might have been that somebody mere-
ly happened by and looked into the freshly
dug hole out of curiosity but any well-
intentioned stranger would certainly have

come on down to the camp and passed a
word the top of the tent was plainly visi-
ble a dress-shoe in that solitude thirty
miles from a cinder walk was enough in
itself to arouse suspicion

  his thought flashed to tregor he put
his own foot beside the track and measured
the track was much too small

  one thing was dead sure somebody
was hanging around there in the woods spy-
ing upon the diggings-some bush sneak
with no friendly purpose watching to see
if they had struck something rich per-
haps one of the pencil-and-hatchet artists
idling around valleria had wondered where
the superintendent and his tunnel-master
had vanished to and had followed jim up
the lake at his first trip

  it was a queer feeling-to know that out
in the bush eyes were upon him and that
a rifle could cut him down at any moment

  strolling away casually as if he had seen
nothing he went down to camp while he
waited that afternoon he wrote out claim-
notices and signed them for james dorval
and himself the afternoon wore away
at dark he slipped out through the back
of the tent crawled over the moss to a
windfall log and lay behind it listening
for prowlers he heard nothing but the
better-go-rounds the loons out on the lake
a big cat screaming up the gorge and a
porcupine gnawing his nocturnal meal from
a near-by ash at gray dawn he fell asleep
for a couple of hours

  jim was back the next mid-afternoon his
canoe drawing heavy under the weight of
the assaying apparatus wayne met him
as he pushed through the flags

  ive got some bad news son he said
in a cautious voice

  so have i jim countered

defore they unloaded the canoe they
sat down on the bank and lighted their
pipes

  i got down there a little after dark
jim began the chink fixed me a bite to
eat and i went over to andersens house
nobody else saw me nils said hell
yaas when i asked him about borrowing
the torch we went up to the tool-house
and got the thing while we were up
there he says to me

   yimmy deys someting wrong about
dis mine we air workin only de left
tunnel ant only half-time on dat i went
down to de office de other evenin to ask
for a new set of drill-bits an i hearit
book magazine

tregor cussin to himself like a mule-
whacker i tink deys someting rotten
in dat shaft we rock-hogs dont know
wot

  i took a lamp wayne and went into
the shaft for a look-see in the center and
right tunnels the last two blasts hadnt
been removed it was plain old diabase

i crawled over it and looked at the walls
you could see the fault line where she
pushed up as plain as your nose hell
knows where the lode is on the other
side of that diabase thrust it might be
five hundred feet lower or a mile back in
the hills

  i figured that the thrust was what made
the vein get thicker these last couple
months it sort of doubled the vein back
and widened it like you blunt the end of
an iron bar theres maybe a few hundred
tens of ore yet in that left tunnel and
a little clean-up back along the shaft when
thats done old polonius gold-mine wont
be anything but a hole in the ground
when jim finished wayne sat thinking
he was out of the mine now the news
made little difference with him he felt
sorry for nancy arnold but most of his
sympathy went to the men who would be
thrown out qf work many of them hadnt
a penny ahead those who couldnt move
away would be in hard lines that coming
winter

  the thought struck him that he and jim
would need the whole crew at the new
mine if the assay showed rich ore

  he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and
glanced around my news is short and
sweet jim were being watched

  jim sprang to his feet

 what how dyou know

  dont yell sit down and act natural
i found a track up at the pit yesterday
the canoe that followed you up from val-
leria the last time was shadowing you
after all

  whats our next move then

  well go right on with the assaying i
figure theyre not going to get rid of us
till they know for sure weve struck some-
thing rich otherwise theyd have bumped
us off already

  well make our test tonight what-
ever it shows well act like its a dud
then if weve got a gold vein up that
slope well crawl up and stake it tonight
slip away in the canoe and be at the land-
effice tomorrow morning wed better
get to work now

by william byron mowery



  they carried the torch and tank the
scales the box of chemicals the flux ma-
terial the crucible and its muffle housing
up to the tent to eliminate any chance
of a serious mistake wayne decided that
each of them would run a separate test and
compare results jim started his work
first

   he weighed out half an assay ton of
the ore-a mere handful-powdered it
and mixed it in a clay dish with test lead to
alloy the gold and silver-if there were
any over the hot torch the slag flowed
to the sides of the dish the eye formed
in the middle and disappeared when the
muffle was opened he poured the liquid
mass into a mold when it was removed
and hammered the slag broke away like
brittle glass leaving a button of the
alloy

  with the poor equipment he had to
work slowly and carefully it took him
an hour and a half to get the alloy button

vvhen he finished that and before he
 started the final process wayne began
his test for only one of them could work
at once by the time he was hammering
out the alloy from the slag twilight was
settling down

   take it slow partner he warned as
jim began the cupeling process we
want it to be dark when we finish this
work

  in another hour jim straightened up
from the scales with a gesture of disgust
he flung the contents of the pan into the
bush

   hell wayne he called across the fire
a mine of that ore wouldnt pay for the
roofing timber

  wayne looked at him sharply could
jim his excitable impulsive partner be
playing a game as cool as that when the
difference was a fortune or a hole in the
ground if he was he was playing it so
well that his own partner ten feet away
could detect nothing but disgust and disap-
pointment

  you might have made a mistake son
ill see what luck i have

   he ran his test through to the end while
jim sat on a log and smoked long be-
fore he finished he saw what the result
would be despite himself his hands trem-
bled as he lowered the agate beam of the
scales and saw the pointer creep across
the notches

   but he straightened up as jim had done
the arnold legacy



the blue

flung pan and all into the brush and kicked
over the crucible with a disgusted oath

  as he sat down on the log and filled
a pipe he exchanged a side-long glance
with his partner in a sharp whisper jim
was saying

  ive heard of a pot of gold at the end
of a rainbow wayne but thats tame com-
pared to us weve found a pot of gold
and silver at the business end of a thunder-
bolt

chapter v

while they smoked their pipes out a
 mass of clouds reared up from be-
hind the mountain range west of the lake
and hid the half-moon as they came on
across the sky the wind freshened a
few great drops of rain fell

  just what we need tonight jim
wayne remarked in a whisper then
aloud no use to sit here and mope
about it lets go to bed and sleep it off
inside the tent they held a whispered
conference and laid the final plans

  for heavens sake be cautious wayne
warned it means our mine and our
lives to boot when you were bending over
the scales i caught a glint like firelight on
a rifle-barrel out in the bushes i was
ready to kick the fire out if you miscued
waiting a few minutes till the rain came
down in earnest and the wind drowned any
noise they would make they crept out at
the back of the tent rifles in hand and
inched away toward the slope at its foot
they rose and crept on up to the pit

  they dared not risk time or the noise
of cutting stakes these could be seen and
pulled up anyway wayne plucked off
some birch paper from a tree in that they
wrapped the notices lifted up the velvety
carpeting of moss at three different places
and hid the notices where they were safe

  in the woods around them the lightning
struck shivering dose they kept away
from the deadened pine and ducked into
the bushes when the woods were lit up by
the flashes the lightning running in ad-
vance of the storm passed on southeast in
a few moments the bolts no longer ripped
the sky overhead

  they crept down the slope again and
lying behind the windfall log they watched
their camp wayne had no intention of
going back there but up at the pit jim
had hinted that possibly he was manufac-

turing a big scare out of a shoe-track and
a glint in the darkness

  a leafy hardwood towering over the tent
protected the fire from the rain the burn-
ing logs flung a glow into the branches of
the tree and lighted up the nearest bushes
just as he was beginning to think jim
might be right his eyes caught a move-
ment in one of the junipers he touched
jim and pointed

  a mans head and shoulders slowly
emerged from the bush for several long
minutes he crouched there peering through
the flap-front of the tent in the flickering
shadows they could not make out his fea-
tures but they saw his swarthy complexion
and noted his cautious snakelike move-
ments

  an indian or a breed wayne whis-
pered hes not the bird who made that
shoe-track its a two-man outfit at least
the play we staged must not have satisfied
em theyre suspicious or they wouldnt
be spying on us like that theyll find out
shortly that we tricked em if we dont
want to settle this business with rifles wed
better be halfway down the lake by the
time they find out were gone

they backed away and circled to hit
the lake shore three hundred yards be-
low camp wading through the wind-
whipped flags to the landing-place wayne
went up after the canoe he crawled up
the bank lifted the craft down to the
water and carried it back to jim they
stepped in and pushed through the flags
out upon the bosom of lac valleria

  in less than a hundred yards they real-
ized that the storm which had so far been
their friend was now an enemy the wind
whipping down from the mountain range
and across the open water made it un-
navigable for the canoe it was a slim
sharp-pointed craft built for the skookum
chuck or forest-buried river and not for
a white-capped lake

  they were baling oftener than they were
paddling twice in the first ten minutes a
curling wave slapped against the canoe and
came within an ace of foundering it

  a mile below camp a little juniper island
lay five hundred yards offshore by des-
perate work they made the lee of it but
their canoe was half full of water re-
luctantly wayne turned the craft toward
it

  well have to wait for the lake to die
down jim thatll be quicker than going
book magazine



ashore and hitting the trail to the rail-
road if we cant navigate tonight the
gentry back behind us cant either

  they landed and found a little level
glade overhung by limber pine and car-
peted with soft springy moss with the
ranoe over their heads they waited out
the rain

  a little after midnight it stopped
toward morning the wind quieted the
weather faired off and the lake quickly
stilled

  they launched the canoe and lost no
time getting away again wayne turned
it out into the middle of the lake beyond
reach of any rifles that might take a no-
tion to speak from the shore under their
sturdy paddles the canoe skimmed along at
a good clip watching behind and seeing
nothing he felt confident that they had
given their enemies the slip

  the early sun already was  gilding the
western shore of the lake the water had
quieted down to a silvery mirror-placid
sheet broken here and there by leaping
trout canvas-back and cinnamon teal
skittered over the surface fish eagles
on snags along the shore chak-chaked to
one another

  eight miles below the camp a headland

by william byron mowery

stood out into the lake as they danced
down toward it sheering off a little to
keep away from its point wayne saw jim
suddenly stiffen his paddle upraised for a
stroke he looked ahead

  a canoe larger than their own with
three men in it was darting from the point
of land to head them off

jim turned around his face was a trifle
pale but his voice was steady enough
theres our friends wayne blocking
the road theyve got one rifle on us
whats the call

  wayne looked at the enemy canoe for a
moment thinking swiftly

  we could get ashore i guess but id
rather meet an indian or a breed on open
water like this than in the woods well
stay out here and settle the dispute its
been drifting toward a rifle argument for
the last three days

  put down your paddle jim ill do the
maneuvering that  of yours is good
at long range ill keep us back away from
them and give you a chance

  the two craft glided within a long rifle-
shot of each other a gun barked a bullet
whistled over waynes head he crouched
lower steadying the canoe with the paddle
so that his partner could sight

in the prow of the boat jim was kneeling
with his rifle leveled he took a slow de-
liberate aim and pulled

the three men ducked down in their
craft jims bullet must have grazed the
man he aimed at for it struck the water a
scant hundred yards beyond

dont aim at the men wayne bade
him its chance at that distance and
theyve got three chances to your one
weve got to sink their boat at long range
shoot low if you strike the water this
side of em the bullets will glance on
through their canoe

the three men seeing that wayne was
his craft stopped theirs they

o

he ran across a token that made
him throw his rifle into his hand
and glance around sharply
the arnold legacy

fired all three at once one bullet clipped
through the canoe luckily up at the gun-
wale another sang past waynes ear

  jim answered with the four shots in his
magazine as fast as he could work the
bolt two bullets glanced off the water
and tore through the canoe high up a
third was a clean miss the fourth hit the
canoe squarely at the wind-water line

  the man nearest the hole lunged forward
and put his hand over it the man in the
middle slashed off a square of canvas and
passed it to him

  twice more like that one jim and
theyll be swimming like muskrats in these
twelve feet of water wayne encouraged
him give it to em while theyre broad-
side on

   jim clipped in five cartridges and raised
the rifle before he could shoot the three
men fired again the paddle in waynes
hand was knocked out of his grasp a
bullet sprayed jim with water and tore
through the canoe at his feet he emptied
his magazine at the enemy one bullet at
the wind-water line again-ripping a hole
as big as a fist the others were through
the boat but high

vvayne reached forward for the other
 paddle and backed the canoe off as
jim reloaded the three men guessing
where he was aiming whirled their craft
and presented only its narrow prow when
they had mended the boat again it began
creeping forward to force the battle

  small as the prow of the canoe was jim
hit it twice low down with his next five
shots wayne kept backing away his
partner plainly could outshoot them a
few more exchanges like that and they
would be swimming

  they must have realized that they stood
a poor chance at that range in spite of all
that wayne could do they closed up
they were not shooting now they made
no effort to patch their boat they meant
to finish the argument first

  twice jim emptied his magazine at them
as they glided nearer across the water at
the sharp crack of his rifle the three men
ducked low with the boat unsteady be-
neath him his aim was poor his bullets
whizzed over or struck to one side of them
the enemy did not answer steadily their
canoe cut down the intervening space

  wayne dropped his paddle and caught
up his own heavy rifle he steadied the
canoe with a hand on the gunwale and

bade jim hold his fire lying full length in
the bottom of the boat resting rifles on
their palms they waited

  at four hundred yards the men in the
other boat quit paddling their momen-
tum kept them gliding gently closer their
craft swerved slightly touched by a whisper
of breeze an arm over the side attempted
to point it straight again but failed at
three hundred yards it had turned to a
half-broadside wayne cocked his rifle

  now

   at the same instant his gun and dorvals
cracked he saw puffs of smoke from the
other boat his hat was knocked off his
head into the water he was blinded for
a moment with spray that a slug kicked up
he clipped in a fresh magazine and poured
a stream of bullets at the boat shooting as
fast as he could crook trigger-finger

  one way or another in ten seconds the
arbitrament of rifles would be settled

  one of the three men in the other canoe
leaped up and fell limply across the gun-
wale jims rifle was hit as he reloaded
and its bolt action shattered he flung it
down and whipped out his belt-gun-use-
less at that distance against two rifles
wayne was shooting desperately aiming
point-blank at the boat not daring to take
better aim

   as he poured another magazine of bullets
at the enemy canoe he saw its side cave
suddenly in as if the middle rib had been
smashed it rocked a moment he heard
a yell as it filled and capsized throwing its
occupants into the water

  he brushed a hand across his eyes and
watched only one man came up he
trod water for a bewildered moment saw
the canoe and his two foes and started
swimming for the point of the headland

  his strokes were slow and labored he
never would make it

   the hole at jims feet was shooting water
into the canoe it was flooded a couple of
inches deep already and threatening to
sink wrapping a cartridge in his hand-
kerchief jim plugged the hole as best he
could

  with his eyes on the swimmer struggling
desperately wayne caught up his paddle
and whirled the canoe around jim looked
up at him

  whats the idea

  that bird cant make it ashore hell
go down in fifty yards

  well

  well pick him up
book magazine

  we will like hell

  cool down partner you wouldnt like
to remember watching a man drown we
want to find out the who and why of this
affair besides maybe we havent got all
of them

  in spite of jims angry objection he
drove the canoe toward the swimmer

  before they could reach him the man
went down

  with a powerful back-stroke wayne
stopped the canoe and hovered over the
spot peering into the blue water against
the clean sand bottom he made out the
blurred form of the man fighting desper-
ately to rise again his water-soaked clothes
dragging him down

  twice he kicked up within a few feet
of the paddle thrust at him but in his wild
thrashing missed and sank again wayne
could see him pawing frantically at the
sand bottom

  the sight was more than wayne could
endure he kicked off his shoes stripped
off his coat and dived overboard

  when he came up again with a hand
twisted in the coat collar of a limp form
jim was in the stern ready to help he
grasped his partners hand and guided it
to a clutch on the gunwale

  dont try to board he ordered
grabbing up the paddle wed capsize
sure ill tow you both ashore

  a ten-minute battle and the water-
logged canoe touched the point of the head-
land wayne dragged his man out of the
water spread-eagled him and dropped
down to work him back to consciousness

  good lord jim he burst out at sight
of the mans face its frank hya-
cinthe

the office manager was sitting up in a

	few moments but dazed and groggy
still he looked around him at the lake
the tongue of land the upturned canoe
then his eyes fell on wayne wringing the
water from his clothes he realized where
he was and what had happened

  his eyes could not meet waynes the
red flush of shame spread over his pinched
blue face his head bowed he did not
once look up again

  i would you dirty skunk jim rasped
at him

  wayne put on his clothes and sat down
in front of his former office manager
never in all his life had he seen a man so
stricken with shame

by william byron mowery



  well talk now hyacinthe dont try
to lie or be bashful with information who
were your friends out there

  hyacinthe did not take his eyes off the
ground but he answered readily enough
they were two blackfeet breeds that
have been hanging around valleria

  real nice company for you to be loping
the bush with wasnt it your shoe-track
i saw up at our test hole-a small pointed
shoe

  yes

  how did you and your friends happen
to slide out from this headland and cut us
off we thought wed given you the slip
one of the breeds looked in your tent
last night you two were not there i
guessed you outwitted me then we found
your canoe was gone i guessed youd have
to go ashore in that wind we carried our
boat down the trail and waited

   sounds like you were the brains of this
bush-sneak party the breeds did the spy-
ing and you sorta managed them is that
right

  its-true

  did we get all your gang any more
hanging around in the bush up there
no the two breeds was all

  how did you know where we were in
the first place

  id heard you and dorval talking about
that vein maybe cropping out again up the
east range the chink told me youd gone
away in a canoe when dorval came back
for the dynamite and drill i had the
breeds follow him and spot your camp
all right weve got the surface facts
now well dig a little deeper i had my
eyes opened to you down in the office sev-
eral weeks ago when you switched affec-
tions to tregor i can understand your
wanting to own a nice rich discovery claim
that some one else discovered-wanting it
so bad you were willing to shoot two men
youd worked with for several years-
but what i cant understand is this
you never struck me as being a self-starter
hyacinthe you always seemed to drift
with the main breeze all right for office
work handling a pencil but no good where
initiative was needed to find you up here
managing a coup like this handling a rifle
-its got me suspicious open up

  we planned it together i arranged
most of the details because he is a che-
cliahco in the bush we were to go fifty-
fifty-

  we
the arnold legacy



  yes-tregor and me

  jim sprang up from the canoe as if he
had been prodded wayne merely grinned

  sit down son he bade dorval this
is just getting interesting it was worth
diving into the river for tregor was play-
ing pretty heavy stakes wasnt he hya-
cinthe

he had to do something the mine-
we know all about the mine playing
out go right on he was up a stump and
had to rob somebody but why did he pick
on jim and me in particular

  he knew you two are experts he heard
the rumors about this vein up the east
range he knew youd find it if anybody
could he didnt have any particular love
for you and besides-

  besides what

  he was afraid of you

  afraid of me i walked off without
making any trouble and left him have the
arnold mine

  it wasnt that it was miss arnold
what about her where does this
afraid come in there

  he was afraid you might get her after
all

  afraid he might get her after all
heavens and earth didnt tregor have her
already

  you mean he was afraid that if i struck
a discovery that made me rich she might
-might change her mind asked wayne

  i dont think the possibility of a rich
discovery had anything to do with his fear

it was you personally i believe he didnt
like the idea of your being around valleria
to say it straight out i believe he wanted
to get rid of you for good and all

  what makes you think that

  i wouldnt blame you for calling me a
liar but i hung back from-from using
rifles on you and dorval i argued i could
beat you to the land-office and get the
claim i said it would be a lot surer than
a fight with you but he insisted you
should be killed thats why we came out
at you on the water when we had an eight-
mile start

  it turns out you were correct on that
count wayne observed dryly so he in-
sisted on bumping me off i dont under-
stand him there after the proof she gave
him of her choice did he still think i might
beat him

  i guess-he must have

  why

  i dont know what their relations were

by william byron mowery

-i mean how sure he was of her im only
guessing he asked me about those two
years when you and miss arnold were to-
gether i told him i thought she liked you
and was i think i said engaged to you
before her fathers death

  arent ihey planning to get married
  yes it is set for next week

  he should have left well-enough alone
wayne commented he hadnt-and
hasnt-any grounds to be afraid of me
is that all you know now about this whole
transaction

  its all i know

  the question is jim whatre we going
to do with hyacinthe

  turn him over to corporal clark
but see here ten chances to one the
real skunk didnt commit himself in this
affair theres no material evidence against
him you can bank on his seeing to that
weve got the stuff on hyacinthe his tool
but nothing on tregor hed probably
succeed in lying completely out of it
hyacinthe would have to pay for him
he deserves to let him let him get
soaked hard

  wayne thought a moment his partner
usually listened to reason but he was mad
all through now

  jim suppose you had spied on a man
tried to murder him and got licked sup-
pose he pulled you out of the water chewed
the rag a few minutes and then let you go
what would you do

  id go shoot myself

  exactly hyacinthe wont do that he
hasnt got your nerve but hes got a
sense of shame just as you have take a
look at him there what im driving at
if you want to soak him and soak him
hard let him go

  but thats only a side argument its
to our advantage not to turn him over to
the mounted see here we dont want to
get messed up in an affair like this men
would say uh-huh bad blood between
them over the girl that claim-snatching
is just dorvals and waynes version im
not anxious to have my name connected
with a shooting-party better just keep it
quiet we can do that nobody but the
devil will ever miss these two breeds and
hell know right where they are

  jim scowled at hyacinthe a little while
before he answered
wayne dived overboard when he
came up with a limp form jim
was ready to help

  i guess youre right wayne a shoot-
ing affair always reflects on both parties to
it but theres one thing-nancy ought
to be told about tregor you naturally
cant but i will i dont mean she might
swing back to you if she knew about him
for her own sake- he broke off
abruptly hell i cant keep from liking
her wayne in spite of everything id
hate to think of her marrying a carcajou
like him

  wayne tried to think of her imperson-
ally as he would think of any other girl
tregor would probably walk the straight
and narrow after this sharp lesson if she
loved him she would be happy with him
anyway they would go back to the east
together the whole sorry affair would be
smoothed out

  it works both ways jim he said pres-
ently in my case she was a grown
woman making her own choice in this
case she has to be too she had a couple
years to judge me and a couple to judge
tregor she made her choice when she
signed that wage-cut

  but i wont be unjust ill do for her
what id do for any girl weve got to
protect her as much as we can when you
go down go and see tregor jtell him
were hep to his whole trick throw a
scare into him tell him were going to
keep an eye on him and if he doesnt toe
the line from now on well dig up old
bones

  its your concern jim agreed reluc-
tantly if thats how you feel about it
ill tell her nothing

at beginning of twilight that evening
wayne was in camp watching through
a screen of spruce boughs for his partners
return taking hyacinthe along jim had
gone down to register the claim bring up

grub supplies and get surveying instru-
ments

  with two rifles and two paddles no
longer needed wayne had walked back up
the shore trail to keep an eye on the dis-
covery and do some of the preliminary work
before the inevitable rush of prospectors
and speculators

  during the day he had roughly staked
out plots of the level shore terrace for the
mill site and the homes of the workmen
already he had formed plans of dredging
a channel into the lake bank so that a barge
could bring up machinery and other
things from the railroad up the lake half
a mile away from the bustle and noise of
the stamps he had staked a little glade
where he thought jim would want to build
his home and eleanors

  with one exception the whole outlook
was roseate that one exception wayne
would not admit to himself though all
the other things were trivial in comparison
with it

  while he was staking jims home in the
glade he had tried to whistle uncon-
cernedly but could not the challenge to
his energy that lay ahead of him in erecting
the mill the pleasure of having his old crew
back with him again the pride of owning
his own mine the certainty of splitting a
fortune with jim dorval-all of it left him
strangely cold

  down the lake the canoe came in sight
three hundred yards away jim shouted
and waved a paper in token that the claim
was theirs wayne met him and carried
the instruments to the tent


the arnold legacy

  did you see tregor

  i did that i looked him in the eye for
ten minutes he promised everything i
think you sized him up right wayne he
was in a desperate pinch he saw a chance
to get a mine and be rid of you at one
crack its his first misstep he may toe
the line from now on but-theres a canoe
coming up the lake

  more bush-sneaks

  no its-nancy

  wayne dropped the instrument he was
adjusting did you tell her

  i did not i didnt even see her while
i was there

  then whats she coming for

  how do i know

in a few minutes more the second canoe
came slipping up the shore along the
flags attistah the beaver guide was pad-
dling it kneeling indian-fashion in the
stern in the twilight wayne made out a
girlish figure sitting in the middle

  if you dont want to go through with
it partner jim ventured ill stay here
and meet her

  id rather she hadnt come wayne
answered quietly but sometime or other
id meet her and have to go through with
it it had better be now

  jim walked aside as the canoe slipped in
through the flags and touched the bank
attistah stayed in it nancy came up alone
to the tent

  she was dressed in the woods clothes she
had worn that day he cut the birch-marl
ring for her it struck wayne oddlyr at
first in his bitterness he wondered why
a deliberate attempt to bring back the two
sunlit years to appear to him as she had
been then to gain whatever she had come
for

  then he realized that on the long canoe-
trip she had honestly needed them

  she stopped a few feet from him leaning
against the moss-clad trunk of the hard-
wood she was breathing quickly he could
see the tie throbbing up and down on her
breast he steeled himself against a mad-
dening impulse to go up and take her in
his arms he had fought out that battle
weeks ago

  for several moments she did not speak
it seemed to him she was leaning against
the massive trunk for support and strength
they were looking into each others eyes
there was no dissembling no studied poise
in her words or mien now in the swift

the blue

tfnse scene between them all pretense and
evasion dropped

  ive heard about my worthless mine
stephen wayne

  im sorry i expected the end to come
any time

  i know what you did there those four
years i know all the-the sacrifices i
heard about the offers you turned down at
other places when you werent even tak-
ing a salary for yourself i was writing
letters about-about the money you sent
to me i remember one it was criminal
dont be unjust to yourself miss
arnold you didnt know

  why didnt you tell me

  i didnt want to put you under obliga-
tions

  but why did you sacrifice yourself and
waste all those years

  you might guess why

  but will you tell me why-from your
own lips

  why was she wanting to be told some-
thing that she had known for six years

  if you had come back alone he said
frankly i would have been repaid a thou-
sand times thats why

  her cheeks flushed she looked away
from him while she spoke

  i suppose-it is too late-to repay you
-now

  she was offering herself to him that
had been the purpose of her visit she had
led directly to it she had asked his avowal
of love so that she could offer herself with-
out shame

  her part of the bargain she was
carrying it through as he had known she
would he gave bitter thanks that he had
done the honorable thing in leaving her
free to make her choice

  he did not answer her last words she
took a step forward looked up at him for
a moment her eyes clung desperately to his

  she turned away from him as if to
leave but checked herself her voice was
low and spiritless when she spoke again

  i heard about your discovery here
stephen i thanked god for it you went
on with your work and forgot me as you
should have done instead of yielding to
any-any weakness it seemed you came
into your own the moment you broke away
from that mine-and all its influence it
seems my father was your enemy in all he
did wont you take the machinery from
my mine and use it here its a poor pay-
ment but its all ive got
book magazine

  yes its all youve got thats why i
cant take it miss arnold tregor can
dispose of-

  i heard about tregor too you would
have kept me in ignorance about him try-
ing to kill you and jim

  who told you all these things
frank hyacinthe he came to me
down there after jim released him he
told me the story of those four years-
and all about his dealings with tregor
why

  it was from gratitude to you stephen
he said he would give everything he had on
earth to be back working for you he
knew id never let tregor see me again
he thought id come up here to you when
i knew the truth he didnt suspect that
you no longer-wanted-wanted-

  what made tregor so anxious to kill
me miss arnold when you sided with
him in that wage-cut-

  i was led to sign it he knew that
  led you were free-

  she made a gesture of dissent

  ive been led all my life she in-
terrupted bitterly you treated me just
as my father did stephen you kept me
in ignorance and let me go on playing these
four years when i should have been here
with you he kept me in ignorance and
continued to rule my choice of this and
that i hardly had a mind of my own
tregor like you and my father laid a
sheet of paper in front of me and told me
to sign i knew what it meant but i
wasnt free

  i wasnt free-not till i started up here
to see you and ask to pay you that was
the first free thing ive done in all my
life

  the blood was hammering madly
through waynes head the first free
thing-did it mean she came rot from a
sense of duty of her deep obligation to
him but because she loved him

  he went up to her and laid his hand on
her arm

  nancy look at me youll tell me the
gods truth there is only one question
between us now when you came here
with tregor before you found out what
id done these four years were you en-
gaged to him

  he could see the word no fashioning
itself upon her lips she tried to utter it
but could not he knew from her eyes
it would have been a lie his hope died
his hand dropped from her arm

by william byron mowery



che turned away from him and went
 blindly down toward the canoe wayne
did not follow he stood watching silent
he thought that once she stopped and
looked back at him but in the evening
gloom of the junipers he could not be sure
she reached the canoe crouched down in
it the indian skirled it out upon the lake

  in the deepening twilight it faded out of
his sight while he still could hear the swish
of the paddle when that too had gone
he leaned against the mossy hardwood
staring at nothing save the bleak years
ahead

  he knew now the battle with himself the
battle to forget her had never been won
he had been deluding himself he could
not forget could never put her out of his
life the mere sight of her had roused all
the old fierce longing which he thought he
had put down her presence was like a
subtle perfume against it resolve and
steeled will were powerless

  jim stepped back into camp for a si-
lent moment or two he looked at the gray
drawn face of his partner

  i couldnt help hearing part of it
wayne he spoke up i wonder if you
did the right thing

  she came back engaged to tregor
wayne said dully you cant get around
that she admitted it

  but wait a minute i think i see this
whole thing now i didnt see it before she
came or id have spoken up then i want
to remind you of something you told me
several times that her fathers influence was
the most powerful thing in her life thats
what she was driving at a minute ago when
she said shed been led to do this and that
she was telling the truth when she said
that coming up here was the first free thing
shed done in all her life

  but she came back-

forval stopped him i know what
youre going to say she came back
here intending to marry tregor thats
true she deliberately tried to put you out
of her life thats true too but why

  while we were going down the lake
hyacinthe gave me an earful that snoop
knows everything and he was so grateful
to you that he spilled all he knew

  old polonius put one over on you
wayne he slipped you a mean one boy
thats what she was driving at when she
said he was your enemy you think
he liked you he did as far as the mine
the arnold legacy

work went but no farther he was
shrewd enough to be double-faced and you
not know it

  when he saw you and nancy getting
thick he investigated you i hate to say
it wayne but your dad and mother
were against you when old polonius
found that out you know he had a mind
hardern plymouth rock and queer no-
tions about genteel blood friendship or
his debt to you didnt stop him from slip-
ping you a mean one you werent any
husband for his daughter like father
like son-thats what he thundered at nan-
cy and his word was law to her in her
eyes when you didnt give in like your dad
you proved old polonius hereditary taint
was a damned lie dont you realize that
was what she was driving at

  wayne whirled upon him

  youre lying you want to see me
marry her-

  easy wayne-im not through yet
heres some more he practically ar-
ranged her marriage with tregor he gave
her a flat order not to have anything to do
with you that was in his will imagine
what it meant to her just after his death
you can blame her if you want to for
obeying him-for bringing tregor back
with her treating you cold as a sort of
self-protection forcing herself to something
she shuddered at but dyou realize
wayne that when she came up here and
offered herself to you she broke away from
her father and defied him why she
couldnt tell you in three words after youd
refused to-to be paid

vvayne leaned against the tree his
 brain whirled giddily in the tumult
of his emotions one thing stood out very
clearly hyacinthe the snoop had saved
him from a horrible mistake-if it were
not too late now

   i didnt believe it myself wayne jim
idded i thought hyacinthe was string-
ing me i didnt believe the old pater ja-
milias would do you a trick as mean as
that but when i heard what she told you
that proved it what are you going to
do about it

  wayne turned swiftly and made for the
canoe

  he sensed rather than saw that jim
was hurrying after him and getting into
the boat

  we can catch em wayne he said
softly before they pass the island

by william byron mowery

n

  wayne did not answer he was dipping
his paddle blade-deep and peering ahead
into the purple twilight

  within a mile they came in sight of the
indians canoe and overhauled it rapidly

  it may be jim-wayne turned his
head around-it may be that nancy and
i will go down the lake together if we
do you hurry on ahead with the indian
i want you to catch frank hyacinthe
hes had his lesson tell him if he wants
his old job back he can have it

  good heavens dorval gasped and
shall i give tregor your love

  as they drew near they saw nancy
still crouched down in the middle of the
canoe her head bent in her arms as they
came closer still and drew alongside he
saw that she was weeping bitterly at the
camp she had kept her self-control but
her courage had utterly broken as she
started back on the lonely trip to valleria

  wayne took things in his own hands
they had drifted long enough

  get into this boat he ordered the
indian you me change places you go
down lake with dorval

  the indian looked at nancy at the un-
expected sound of waynes voice she
glanced up startled she turned her head
away and tried to dash the tears from her
eyes

  bewildered by his order she did not
know what to say wayne and attistah
changed places

  now paddle jim bade the indian
  their canoe vanished

  wayne headed his craft for the island
shore a hundred yards away when it
touched he stepped out and drew it along-
side a rock

  nancy

  she had buried her face in her arms
again she did not look up or answer for
a moment he leaned over her not daring
to touch her then he stooped swiftly
picked her up in his arms and carried her
ashore to a seat on a mossy rock in the
glade of limber pines

  what weve been looking forward to
for years nancy is ours now-if youll
forgive me

  but you-you refused she sobbed
you didnt want to be paid

wayne brushed the past aside with a
single question are you glad i came
he waited till she turned her face up to
him her arm went around his neck in an-
swer
the
trail of
death

h bedford-jones

with a wild
laugh he thrust
out the pistol
and fired

  over abbeville the second in this remarkable series
  includes one of the most unusual and exciting scenes
  ever described-a fight to the death waged in the
  narrow cabin of a london-to-paris passenger plane

  illustrated by l r gustavson

durant stood at the rail watching
the gleam of the lands end light
twinkle across the night the
tyrania was on the last leg of her voyage
at dawn she would be just off plymouth
and all those who could change at the last
moment would go into the lighter instead
of on to cherbourg for dirty weather lay
ahead of her durant had changed but for
other reasons

  a light step and durant turned to find
the slender figure of baroness glincka at
his side known aboard ship as mrs rob-
inson her unhappy story was hidden with
her name only durant knew how her dead
husbands cousin boris makoff held her
gripped in tentacles of blackmail forcing
her to aid his little schemes making her an
unwilling but helpless member of his paris
coterie of genteel crooks it was for her
sake that durant had wormed his way into
this organization getting the confidence of
makoff-waiting

  you got the message she asked in the
darkness

  yes and changed youll get off at
plymouth too

  yes boris is planning something at
london before going on im not sure
what but the victim is that white-haired

man who keeps to himself larson the
name is boris introduced him to me to-
night using my real name hes a nice old
man

  and a games on eh durant knew
larson by sight-a stiff bronzed man with
white hair and mustache and shrewd kind-
ly old eyes traveling alone

  something boris wants you to come
into the smoking-room and meet larson
i think hes a dane whos made a fortune
in america and is taking a trip to den-
mark-thats my guess i suppose boris
means to wring his neck in london by your
help and mine

  pleasant prospect said durant

  what will lewis say when he learns the
truth

  he wont learn it ive arranged-at a
little expense youll see in the morning
then youre a magician 

  borrowed magic-from your beauty

che laughed a little and was gone into
the darkness durant stared out at the
gleaming light on the horizon and thought
over the past back to those paris days
when he a clerk in an american branch
bank poor half-starved struggling for life
and health had seen the beautiful bar-


the trail of death

oness glincka come in three times a week
to the next window

  and now he knew her was fighting for
her-was a crook for her sake an odd
turn of destiny an almost forgotten rela-
tive dead a legacy of almost forgotten land
in florida a trip home-wealth then he
headed back for paris to take his ease
where he had starved and fought and
sweated so he had thought-but work had
come to him

  that you durant it was the voice
of lewis who came quietly out of the dark-
ness a cigar-tip glowing redly first sight
of england eh im leaving you in the
morning

  but im going up to london too in-
stead of on to cherbourg

  good shall i see you in london
no wiser not-wait for paris
right ill give you my address there
im going right on-taking the afternoon
plane over tomorrow

  lewis fumbled for a card-case he was a
smallish man very alert-a wholesale drug-
gist from the middle west now engaged
in smuggling a suitcase filled with cocaine
into france-a task in which durant pre-
sumably was aiding true durant had
saved him from boris makoff had dumped
the cocaine into the atlantic and substituted
baking soda for it-and for these services
known and unknown lewis was an ally
once in paris he promised to be a most im-
portant ally

  thanks durant took the card thrust
at him youll hear from me as soon as
i get settled-if not before ive a rather
big game to pull off and therell be pick-
ings in it theyll go to your friends who
help me im not in it for money

  he did not say that he was not in it for
crooks money-he had no intention of
injuring the feelings of lewis just yet the
two men separated and durant headed for
the smoking-room filled to bursting with
the usual last-night crowd

  makoff had a table and lounge in one
comer with him was the silent rather off-
ish larson-impeccably dressed as usual
and only a little less lonely helen-or
baroness helena glincka-had rejoined
them and was drawing larson into
almost lively conversation cards lay wait-
ing on the table

rurant approached saw makoff make
a remark saw the eyes of larson sweep
to him with almost eager interest he

the blue

could not understand it but came up to the
table makoff rose

  ah durant let me introduce you to
mr larson of toledo-mr durant what
about a rubber if your packings done
glad durant bowed to the baronne
and shook hands with larson in whose
mild blue eyes rested that same curious
scrutinizing expression then and later his
manner toward durant was almost deferen-
tial though as a rule his air was brusque
enough that he was quite captivated by
the baronne too was soon evident

  there was no opportunity for private
conversation until a few rubbers ended
helen departed under pretense of having
to pack larson also rose and shook hands
with durant

  if youre alone he said we might
go to london together in the morning
ill be glad said durant finding him-
self liking the old man see you at the
pier eh

  so they parted left alone durant met
the gaze of makoff with inquiring eyes
well whats the game

  the bold aggressive regard of the rus-
sian dwelt upon him for an instant and in
those dark depths durant read startling
baffling things

  tell you later said makoff calmly
with a gesture at the room get up to
london with him ask him to visit you for
a day or so-until monday say the
week-end tell him your car will meet the
train

  my car but i havent any

  your mistake said makoff and
smiled your chauffeur giles will meet
the train and this was all he would say

in the drizzling rain of a dark gray dawn
the tyrania disembarked her passengers
into the lighter while the rattling banging
winches sent aboard the nets of hold lug-
gage durant stood in the rain on the up-
per deck of the lighter watching

  ive been looking for you the baronne
emerged from the cabin joined him her
face was pale anxious her sky-blue eyes
wide and filled with alarm ive learned
whats up-

  durant touching his hat turned sud-
denly to the rail look he broke in
there was a swift commotion forward-an-
gry cries orders a medley of voices one
of the nets had just come down

  what is it she demanded frowning
at the rain-wet scene durant laughed
book magazine



  that he said is the pet suitcase of
our friend lewis going over the side its
gone heres the sequel and he opened
his hand to show a twenty-pound note
but you were going to say-

  she came close to him ive found out
about it she said rapidly in french i
think larsons to be murdered-im not
sure hes carrying a large sum-got it
from the purser-in cash

  ill take care of it said durant and
took her hand he smiled into her eyes
out of the rain now alls well that ends
well au revoir

  the last durant saw of lewis the little
rascal was involved in heated argument at
the customs shed with sundry porters
durant laughed and passed on his own
trail was covered the cocaine and substi-
tute alike were gone and the past was
closed the future remained

ploseted in a first-class compartment
 with larson durant arranged about
breakfast took his companion into the res-
taurant car and thawed him out in no
time returning they lighted cigars and
became more or less confidential durant
found himself treated with the same curious
interest he had noticed the previous eve-
ning but could not penetrate to the reason

  larson was shyly eloquent regarding the
baronne a shrewd old man manufacturer
and banker he was yet in some ways diffi-
dent and unsophisticated as a child-and
makoff had obviously found the way
though durant was slow to realize just
where it lay comprehension came slowly

  perhaps youll stay the week-end with
me asked durant im not going on to
paris at once and id be very glad you
see ive been rather alone

  like me said larson yes i noticed
queer wed run together the last day
why about the visit-i dont know
durant i dont know id like to mighty
well but i expect id make a fool of my-
self im not acquainted with the way you
do things over here

  durant was puzzled the more so be-
cause he himself was acting in the dark
not knowing what makoff intended

  and she was a real baroness eh
larson chewed his cigar well well and
to think of you-but i suppose you dont
imagine that i know who you are but i
do thats why im afraid to accept your
invitation id like to because i like you
anyone can see youre straight as a string

by h bedford-jones

in spite of what they say about nobility
now im not so sure about that russian
chap-

  nobility repeated durant larson
broke into a laugh

  oh i know about it that russian
told me you see so long as youre durant
to me its all right we get on fine but
when you become lord northcote-gosh
man id be proud enough to bust to think
id visited you-but think of the breaks
id make i wouldnt know whether to call
you my lord or mister or what
and being all alone with my wife dead
ive no one to steer me around not but
what its tempting-

  durant laughed largely to conceal his
startled amazement for the old mans lone-
liness struck him as pathetic lord north-
cote

  so im a lord am i he said larson
chuckled

  oh he warned me youd perhaps be an
gry-but ill say nothing about it you
just keep on being durant see if you
will ill accept the invitation how about
it ill have three days in london any-
how leaving there monday

  done said durant

lie probed carefully anxious to make no
slip and came upon the amazing truth
larson a continental by birth had pro-
found respect for nobility now old and
wealthy going back to europe the idea of
mixing with titled gentry was fascinating in
the extreme to him-it was his weak spot

  and lurking in the background behind
all this was black murder

  warn larson impossible against his
plans and hopes for rescuing helen glincka
from the blackmail grip of makoff durant
would have let a dozen larsons go to death
being a party to it was another matter al-
together and here he could act as events
gave him clue he was well assured that
makoff would have made careful plans by
wire for the russian had a very able
criminal organization to back him up
warning larson then might only precipi-
tate the disaster

  sooner or later a break must come with
makoff-indeed durant meant to attack
the man mercilessly pitilessly upon reach-
ing paris there he would be on familiar
ground and would have friends among the
dope-ring thanks to lewis he could fight
fire with fire until then he must inform
himself as fully as possible about makoffs
the trail of death	the blue



crowd arm himself with every possible
weapon prepare

  ill have to play my part save larson
if possible keep under cover with makoff
he decided and aloud my car should
meet the train--have you any luggage
just my two suitcases larson pointed
at the rack then he smiled im keeping
close to them too one of em has a big
roll of currency-more than i could carry
for i have my pockets full besides

  eh durant stared wondering at
such recklessness youre not serious
larson chuckled think it queer eh
well it is but in the old country you
know-and all over europe for that mat-
ter-american money is badly wanted
not in gold because its not pure but bills
so im bringing back a small fortune in
hundred-dollar bills youve no idea what
can be bought with hundred-dollar ameri-
can bills in europe im going to make my
whole family comfortable for life i can
tell you it may be foolish to carry them
but thats all bosh im careful

  yes thought durant youre blessed
careful you dont even talk about it
something eluded him here-he could
sense it larson was right enough about
the american money being in keen de-
mand yet there was some subtly felt note
in the whole thing that rang queer

rurant cynical enough about most
things from his years of bitter struggle
with the world believed in luck luck and
no doing of his had brought him his pres-
ent affluence luck had brought him into
contact with helen glincka luck had
shown him her story had given him the
chance to serve her and now as the boat-
train roared on londonward luck suddenly
bobbed up with the most amazing twist of
all

  another three-quarters of an hour
said larson glancing at his watch hm
fifteen years since ive been in england
and it looks the same-the same-

  the mans face changed suddenly his
words died he jerked his hat a little lower
then turned staring from the window
durant blinked at him wondering at his
manner wondering at the odd something
about the man then he glanced up

  outside their compartment door was
standing a man looking in an ordinary
englishman clipped gray mustache lounge-
suit square chin heavy-lidded eyes-only
the eyes were not ordinary for they were

the eyes of one who gives orders a retired
army man perhaps

  he pushed open the door and came in
his gaze swept durant seemed to compre-
hend him at once went on to larson du-
rant moved over to make room-the man
had come in to smoke no doubt as this
was a smoker and the train was fairly full
next instant however durant realized his
mistake upon the little compartment set-
tled an atmosphere tense and terrible

  sitting opposite larson the englishman
produced a cigarette and lighted it indeed
-but his eyes were fastened upon larson
with a grimly humorous expression larson
gazed at him blankly an instant then
looked away yet with an effort

  a bit older old chap arent you said
the englishman suddenly i fancy we
both are what fifteen years-devilish
long time eh

  coming so soon after larsons remark
these words startled durant showed him
something lay under the surface here and
in the eyes of larson he saw it was
tragedy

  im afraid youre mistaken said lar-
son

  the englishman laughed and at the
sound of it durant stiffened

  really now quite a stroke of luck
this-looking for some one else you know
so your memory has gone off a bit eh
most extranary memory now the
moment i saw you i told myself there was
my old friend gunnar hanson and what
may you be doing in blighty gunnar
hadnt you fancied it might be a bit un-
healthy here eh

  i-im going through said larson in
a strangled voice to the continent ive
made my pile in the states-im going
through not stopping at all

  ah but youre mistaken about that
said the other pleasantly badly mistaken
old thing a little matter-what was the
name inspector bagwell wasnt it i re-
member his funeral quite well i promisee
his widow that id bag you some day
smiling cheerfully at his victim the eng-
lishman put his cigarette between his lips
and puffed at it-unfortunately for him-
self for larson though white as a sheet
lashed out a blow as swift and unexpected
as the stroke of a snake

  one short swift blow-no more to it
the englishman crumpled up and sagged
limply to one side larsons fist showed the
gleam of knuckles as he darted up and to
book magazine

the door he drew the blue curtains then
whirled and stared at durant with a face
of desperation

  durant was laughing-the mad humor of
it struck him in a wave here was a mur-
derer a criminal with a record and makoff
had picked on him as an innocent victim

  well what about it snarled the voice
of larson the latter was suddenly trans-
formed-the shrewd gentle unsophisti-
cated old man had become a crouching des-
perate enemy of society what you going
to do huh my only chance was to stop
his mouth you heard him-it was fifteen



by h bedford-jones

 yes by birth im a naturalized ameri-
 can now yes or no

 yes said durant -provided you
 dont murder this chap

 done with you said larson

 he darted to the prostrate man frisked
 him quickly and efficiently snapped the

larson lashed out a how as swift and unexpected
as the stroke of a snake

years ago theyd nab me for that youre
a lord-you can save me or not what
about it

  durants mirth was abruptly banished
and he stared at larson the man actually
believed makoffs story then

  im no policeman he said i suppose
youve been a virtuous angel the past fif-
teen years eh really a manufacturer
hell no snapped larson wide-eyed
you mean it-youll give me a chance i
aint lying im a crook-but you invited
me you liked me now will you stick to
it or not

  shrewd this thinking durant an eng-
lishman a mistake no briton would have
made and really a lord-a mistake only
an american could have made-larson
was appealing to his pride his sporting in-
stinct of fair play and word given

  what the devil are you demanded
durant a dane as you posed

steel bracelets around their owners wrists
emptied the pockets into his own gagged
him with handkerchiefs stretched him out
along one seat after throwing up the arms
to durant it was a revelation-it showed
the man as nothing else could have done
crook eh then larson was no petty
scoundrel he knew how to do things

  once more the humor of it smote durant
hard with added force after larsons state-
ment the man was a professional crook
self-admitted and makoff had selected him
-but wait crook or not he had swal-
lowed the bait and was hooked thus to an
extent justifying makoffs judgment and
durant himself had been completely de-
ceived by the rascal

  just what sort of crook are you asked
durant extending his cigarette-case he
gave no heed to the senseless detective-
durant had little pity for inefficiency
bank-robber confidence-worker or thug
the trail of death

  larson grinned as he flung his overcoat
over the unfortunate englishman and set-
tled down in comfort

  to tell you the truth a little of any-
thing he said frankly his shrewd old
features settled back into their usual kindly
wrinkles ive touched all sides of the
game-but while im with you im
straight that goes i shouldnt have
stopped off in england at all but i thought
it was safe enough-and i was tempted
now if you and i go together say by air
well get out of the country that is if
youll help me so far otherwise im done
for itll be almost impossible for me to
get out of england now unless-

  he made a gesture toward the shape be-
side him durant shook his head

  none of that ill get you out all
right so youve made your pile in the
states eh in what game

  all kinds said larson and laughed
then he sobered look here well have
to make a quick get-away when we get
to the station-waterloo is it or pad-
dington porters will come through to get
luggage and see if anythings left in the
cars

  dont worry said durant calmly
my chauffeur should meet us there and
to you ill be plain ralph durant under-
stand whats more ill keep your secret
is it agreed

  agreed said larson and put out his
hand ill be on the level with you
durant meant his words he had no in-
tention whatever of telling makoff any-
thing and he shook hands gravely with the
murderer and criminal opposite as a mat-
ter of fact he much preferred the man to
makoff

purant had hitherto seen makoff as a
man of culture energy ruthless ability
but in the ensuing hours he began to realize
why this man could hold his cousins widow
in bonds of blackmail and force her to give
not only money but service to his cause

  he knew makoff could have had less
than twenty-four hours to prepare for his
coup against larson he knew too that
makoff was scrupulously anxious to keep
any breath of police suspicion from his ac-
tivities much of his work lay among the
upper strata of society and he could not af-
ford publicity or suspicion therefore even
granted that he was in touch with some
criminal organization in london his
achievement was marvelous

the blue



  having only hand-baggage larson and
durant slipped out of the train and down
the platform in all haste they would have
only a few moments before the plight of the
unfortunate detective was discovered and
swiftness was imperative before they had
gone the length of the train however a
neatly liveried chauffeur appeared and sa-
luted durant as though from old acquaint-
ance

  all ready your lordship

  ah giles how are you exclaimed
durant inspecting the man he found him
to be no englishman certainly-a con-
tinental of some sort here larson turn
over your bags to giles is the house
opened up for me giles

  quite sir and the other guests sir
you cabled one or two others might ar-
rive-

   havent heard yet giles said durant
and could have laughed to see the expres-
sion on larsons face-half admiring half
delighted lord tiverton hasnt shown
up

  no sir but i have a letter-it came
this morning and as it seemed rather im-
portant i took the liberty to bring it along
sir

  give it to me at the car hurry now
lets get out of this crowd

  durant let giles lead the way and fol-
lowed with larson he did not half like
the looks of this tall rangy chauffeur with
a cast in one eye-the man looked alto-
gether too intelligent to be a petty scoun-
drel durant sized him up as a bulgar or
austrian from his perfect english and the
general cut of his jib

  in another two minutes they were out of
the station and climbing into a waiting
daimler saloon that had all the appearance
of a luxurious private car when he had
stowed the bags giles handed in a letter
closed the door mounted to his seat and
they moved off durant found the letter a
registered envelope addressed to lord
northcote at an address in kings road
richmond

   excuse me will you he said and tore
it open in some wonder he found a page
enclosed bearing the following typed mes-
sage unaddressed and unsigned

     glincka comes tomorrow guest also count
   dardent house small others may come
   giles full charge everything

  as durant pocketed the letter it oc-
curred to him that makoff must have
book magazine

chalked up a pretty telegraph bill from
plymouth

  lord how its changed in fifteen years
exclaimed larson staring out at the streets
thin rain was falling the busses-would
you look at em block the streets almost
-bigger than the houses where are we
heading

  richmond said durant ive a small
place there by the way i think baroness
glincka will show up tomorrow for the
week-end and perhaps count dardent
one or two others-hard to say my re-
turn seems to have been advertised you
know richmond

  no but i used to know a man there
larson fingered his white mustache and
flung durant a smile chap named silver
-a scotchman who managed opera tours
and such i trimmed him at a game once
well i expect hes dead long ago damn-
able luck running into that chap on the
train-used to be a scotland yard man
wonder what he is now a baronet
maybe

  you dont seem worried said durant

  the other shrugged

  not a bit ive got two passports-dif-
ferent names different faces inside half
an hour every passport bureau in the coun-
try will be looking out for my face and
larsons name i couldnt get out of eng-
land on that passport if i wanted to but
on the other and with you to help itll
work anything will work with one of the
nobility in it

  as court records prove and durant
chuckled right-ho well see

rfhe big daimler purred along kensing-
ton park fell behind on to hammer-
smith on out past new built-up additions
until the white square tower of rich-
mond church hove into sight past a long
bend of highway durant knew barely
enough of london to follow the road with
understanding and larson did not cease to
exclaim over the changes of fifteen years

  look here larson turned suddenly
you have a safe in your place i suppose

  durant assented trusting to luck

  well id like you to take charge of my
wad while im here went on the other
i have a bit over sixty thousand and-

  jumping jerusalem ejaculated du-
rant in stark amazement sixty thousand
dollars

  in hundred-dollar bills mostly-for
spending on the continent said larson

by h bedford-jones



i want to take care of my family there
buy em land spend all i want and so
forth

 good lord man you must have
cracked a bank 

  larson chuckled no not exactly
theres been big money in liquor you
know i made that sixty thousand and a
bit over in three months just to show
well if youll stow the coin away ill feel
better-i know these english servants and
id hate to trust em while i can keep it
under my eye all right but traveling here
aint safe

  durant nodded this request compli-
cated the situation a bit beyond keeping
larson from being murdered he had previ-
ously had little interest in the matter
finding the mans actual status he had
been cynically delighted at the game in
prospect since makoff was likely to catch
a tartar now it seemed as though larson
would succeed in robbing himself-if du-
rant let the russian know about the re-
quest

  he decided instantly to do no such thing
the outcome of the whole scheme was im-
material to him though his sympathy was
rather with larson besides-why could
not larson be the man to put a bullet into
makoff possibilities here but he would
have to see helen first if makoff were
dead the blackmail might only be trans-
ferred

  he threw over the whole problem as the
car turned sharply out of the highway be-
tween a pub and a brick wall heading up
the long hill of kings road lined on either
side with its walled english houses and
gardens dismal from the outside comfort-
able and rich within each one having that
sense of privacy and ownership which
means so little to the american so much to
his english cousin abruptly the car halted
before a low house of gray brick walled
about and giles held open the door

  welcome home your lordship he
said cheerfully

  the two men left the car entered the
gate walked up to the house the door was
opened by a maid who curtsied durant
saw at a glance that she was french and
nodded to her giles brought up their bags

ttow makoff had managed this at so

  a short notice was a marvel to durant
the house seemed unpretentious but com-
fortable and was excellently furnished
the living-room windows gave glimpses of a
the trail of death



well-kept garden behind with walks and
fountain

  youve a room ready for mr larson
said durant to the maid good

  she led them upstairs to two adjoining
bedrooms giles put larsons grips in one
those of durant in the other then he dis-
appeared the maid spoke to durant
weve kept luncheon waiting sir
right said durant heartily well
have a wash and be right down make
yourself at home here larson-no cere-
mony come down when youre ready
thanks

  larsons door closed durant turned to
the maid who had waited and spoke in
french

  will m makoff be here

  tomorrow msieur she responded
but he will not be seen

  he nodded and she departed so she
was in the outfit too

  in fifteen minutes durant and his guest
were sitting in a long low dining-room that
overlooked the garden while the belated
luncheon was served larson was full of
admiration over the place as well he might
be his first awe had departed and he
threw off restraint under his taciturn ex-
terior he revealed a shrewd personality as
thoroughly american as that of durant
himself he had spent fifteen years in
america ten years previous to that in
england while his education at home in
denmark had been excellent to realize
that he sat opposite a murderer criminal
bootlegger a charming old man who had
made an excellent unmoral living off so-
ciety was continually astonishing to
durant and larson had asked no ques-
tions about his host or the reason for an
incognito-if he was curious he bottled it
up so durant conjured up a history for
himself and it was accepted without a
word

  you know i liked you at the start
said larson when they lighted cigars and
adjourned to the garden for a look around
you know makoff well

  not well said durant i met him
aboard the boat why

  i dont cotton to him said the other
he may be a nobleman and all that and
the cousin of baroness glincka-that the
name-but i know a crook when i see
one id ought to eh yes sir that bird
for all his society airs is a bad one

  i believe you said durant with a
chuckle wary makoff the russian had

the blue

sensed this suspicion in larson and did not
intend to show himself as a guest makoff
wont show up here im glad to say how
do you know im not a crook too

  larson glanced at him and grinned
youve the makings of one and a good
one-but i know a square-shooter when i
see him lets go attend to that money
shall we

  durant nodded and they went upstairs
he brought one of his own bags into lar-
sons room-a bag specially made with
yale lock though durant had nothing in
it except clothes being fully aware by
sharp experience of the fallacious tourist
belief that english-made clothes were better
than american he had loaded up at home
with a large outfit

  larson opened a suitcase and threw out
on the bed half a dozen packages wrapped
in oiled silk and sealed he broke one open
to reveal crisp new hundred-dollar bills

  six of em he said open the others
up if you like why the suitcase

  to hold them until i can get into the
safe said durant better so

  suit yourself

  what sort of receipt do you want
receipt hell ejaculated larson
dont be a fool i dont need any receipt
from you

  durant calmly opened all the packages
found them to be as stated and then
stowed them away in his grip which he
replaced in his room after locking he
chuckled again to think what makoff would
say to this simple acquisition-after so
much pains and expense had been bestowed
to get larson in a murder-trap

  decidedly he said cynically it pays
to be an honest man

if ad larson been anything but what he
was the composition of lord north-
cotes week-end party must have struck him
as very singular to say the least

  the only woman in the party was bar-
oness glincka who arrived for luncheon
on saturday count dardent proved to
be a worn-out waspish little man with
waxed mustaches and dyed hair who spoke
fair english and fluent danish he was
french and durant made a shrewd guess
that he had left paris very much for his
healths sake not to mention his liberty
he noted that helen glincka very obvi-
ously disliked the little count

  after their day together larson and
durant had become almost intimate
book magazine

durant at least found his liking for the
shrewd old rascal increased by acquaint-
ance nothing had appeared in the news-
papers in regard to the finding of a trussed-
up detective aboard the boat-train but this
meant nothing except that an extensive
secret search was being made for gunnar
hanson no further word had come to



by h bedford-jones

agent michael has full instructions ill
give you yours now larson i believe has
fifteen or twenty thousand dollars in cur-
rency-

sixty said durant makoff whistled
sixty thousand whew still better
he winked delightedly rubbed his hands
this house was taken in his name under-

he snapped the steel
bracelets around the
owners wrists and
gagged him with
handkerchiefs

durant via giles or the maid no other
guests arrived and the four sat down to
dinner saturday night with durant very
much in the dark as to plans larson
however was clearly charmed by thus mix-
ing with continental and english nobility
and enjoyed himself hugely

  dinner was nearly over when giles
leaned above durants chair

  theres a gentleman asking for you
sir in the library

  durant rose excused himself without the
fact appearing strange and passed into the
library he found makoff awaiting him

ah exclaimed the russian glad to
find everything smooth no trouble
none with your perfect arrangements
ill have to turn over the job to you
and michael after all said makoff ive
been called to paris in haste-making the
nine oclock southampton train tonight
whos michael

  giles and makoff chuckled good
man eh dardents our regular london

stand the cook and so forth engaged in
his name now-whats the matter
nothing said durant repressing his
consternation at this news i was wonder-
ing what hed say if he knew

  makoff chuckled the cook will be dis-
charged tomorrow night the maid goes
with dardent-shes his wife by the way
the baronne leaves tomorrow night also
via southampton for paris you and
michael will be here monday morning
when larson drinks his early tea hes done
for places are already booked for you and
michael on the noon plane from croydon
for paris itll be another day or two at
least before larsons body is discovered
perhaps much longer you and michael
will bring the stuff your seat in the plane
is booked in your own name michaels
in that of giles hopper-his passport
identity all clear

  quite said durant except the neces-
the trail of death



the blue

sity for murder why not rob him and go
murder in england means that the law will
be at your heels for life

  certainly makoff eyed him with a
grim smile but why talk of murder my
dear man an empty vial of chloral pur-
chased in a new york drug-store a dead
american who has rented a house for
three months and occupied it for three
days a letter stating that speculations in
exchange have wiped out his fortune-who
would call it murder guests servants all
dissipated as a dream

  it is artistic certainly durants tone
was dry i only objected to so much
work why bother to kill him

  because americans have loud voices
makoff chuckled and certainly we do
not want the law after us surely you can
realize this

  durant nodded and banished his frown
right indeed it is magnificent this
michael is an admirable fellow-i con-
gratulate you on having him he handles
details wonderfully 

  he should said makoff hes no
other than michael korin who killed
grand duke vassily last year in tours and
turned over all his papers to me well ive
no time to lose give my regards to the
charming baronne-and this envelope its
her passage to paris

  durant took the envelope shook hands
with makoff and returned to the dinner-
table

 inwardly he was in a ferment of
anxiety and excitement had it been his
own neck in peril he would have lost no
whit of his usual icy coolness-but here
was another matter by this time per-
haps the fact would be known that larson
had rented a house in richmond-and
scotland yard would be down on him full
force had boris makoff only known it
he could have robbed larson with absolute
impunity

  durant looked at giles too with new
eyes appreciating now the frightful danger
from this man he knew of grand duke
vassilys murder-all europe knew of it
the exiled russian noble had been hide-
ously murdered and robbed-a crime so
horribly brutal so well conceived and exe-
cuted that it was supposed to have been
perpetrated by soviet agents indeed the
name of korin had been mentioned as that
of the murderer but the man had never
been found

  things were getting a bit thick thought

durant to himself in other words the
simple situation was becoming extremely
complex and correspondingly threatening
the only relief in sight was that by sun-
day night the group would be scattered
leaving him and larson alone here with
giles-or michael korin yet would it be
safe for larson to remain here another
twenty-four hours there was the rub

  the quartet adjourned to the garden for
coffee while dardent and larson were
deep in floods of danish the baronne was
temporarily left to durant

  its confounded hard to get a word with
you he complained handing her the en-
velope youre booked for southampton-
havre tomorrow night

  her eyes questioned him anxiously
and you

  paris on monday ill show up never
fear but boris has caught a tartar this
time and doesnt know it so im afraid
you wont see our honest giles again
explain

  shant do it im going by results i
intend to show up in paris and open the
fight on boris-

  you wont find him she breathed
he disappears no one knows-

  tell that to the marines said durant
confidently now you suggest a motor-
trip tomorrow-i want to get out of here
for the day anywhere

the others rejoined them and the coffee
finished they went into the house and
settled down to an evening of bridge
durant had no more chance that evening
for a word with her-he had more than a
suspicion indeed that giles was keeping a
sharp eye on the baronne the motor trip
was settled upon for the next morning
with general acclaim

  it was late when the game broke up and
durant saw his supposed guests to their
rooms then turned in dismissing his prob-
lems he did not waken until roused at
seven-thirty by giles who bore his early
tea after the approved english fashion
then he sat up in bed

  shut the door-thats right look
here these americans arent used to the
english custom of early tea and im afraid
your scheme will slip up in the morning
suppose you fix us up some coffee tonight
after we take baroness glincka to her train
-eh that would make the matter more
certain

  good approved the other his high
book magazine



cheek-bones lending his aquiline face a dis-
tinctly tartar look yes a good idea
thank you

  twenty minutes later after a light knock
at the adjoining door durant stepped into
larsons room larson was shaving and
nodded cheerfully to him durant lighted
a cigarette drew up a chair and played
the idea that had come to him

  what do you think of that man of mine
-giles

  larson grimaced if you ask me i
think hes a crook

  he is durant laughed i overheard
an interesting conversation this morning

it seems that tonight after our party
breaks up a nice little game is to be played
on you and me giles will fix us up some
coffee and sandwiches and when we go to
bed well stay a long time-long enough
for the get-away

  larson holding his razor in air turned
and stared at him

  is that straight would they pull that
stuff on a lord

  you ought to know-youve lived in
england

  hm good gosh man-do they know
about my money

  probably suspect you have some while
they know i have some said durant
whats more i gather that our friend
giles is wanted by the police in several
countries rather interesting to think what
might have happened eh ill turn him
over to the police-

  dont do that larson faced him
earnestly not until im safe anyhow
dont you know their ways here all
hands would be gone over with a fine-tooth
comb and thatd mean my finish

  oh said durant but what to do
then

  take him with us said larson
promptly and his blue eyes sparkled
well take the baroness to her train see
but well have our own luggage aboard too
then you spring it on giles that were go-
ing somewhere for the night-we can go to
a hotel-and tell him to meet us tomorrow
and go to paris with us thatll knock him
off his feet believe me i thought that fel-
low had a bad look to his eye all along
all right well drop him in paris then
meantime about your money giles will
drive us today and thats why the place is
safe enough until tonight well go over by
air and theres no customs examination
that way better make the money into a

by h bedford-jones

separate packet and take it with you how-
ever as the luggage is packed in a separate
compartment

  larson nodded and his wrinkled shrewd
old face cracked in a grin fine my
lord fine well have some fun eh
durant rather thought they would-be-
fore it was over

at ten that sunday morning the big
daimler with the lunch packed and
aboard was standing before the gate of the
kings road house and giles had just an-
nounced that all was ready when larson
flung open the door of durants room with
an excited word

   durant come here-quick 

  durant joined him standing well back
from a window which overlooked the
street larson pointed no words were
needed coming up the hill and looking at
the house with evident interest was the
man they had left trussed and gagged
aboard the boat-train

  pinched said larson

  not yet durant turned shut your
door-get packed

  he darted to the stairs giles here-
quick man

  michael korin came up on the jump and
durant pulled him into his bedroom

  look at that man across the street
know him

  one look and the russian drew back a
gray pallor in his face

  sacred name of a dog he exclaimed
yes thats sir john brentwood him-
self-of scotland yard

  durant gripped him by the arm hard
all right brace up now hes looking
the place over-we have time to get away
somethings slipped perhaps theyre after
you perhapsafter me well get our lug-
gage aboard the car drop baronne glincka
downtown drop dardent and his wife get
out to croydon and make the noon plane
understand ill telephone for bookings
warn dardent get rid of the cook in-
stantly clear the place go

  the man slipped away obviously badly
shaken by what he had seen durant
turned into larsons room

  get ready ive got your money in
my bag were off in five minutes

  ill need ten said larson calmly
enough i must get rid of this mustache
clap on some hair-dye fix my face

  take seven-move like hell snapped
durant
the trail of death



by h bedford-jones

  larson was already plunging for his
bag catching up his own grips without
bothering to pack his scattered belongings
durant hurried downstairs to the telephone
in two minutes he had the croydon aer-
drome on the line

  mr durant speaking he said i have
bookings for myself and a friend on the
noon paris bus tomorrow we want to
change and go over today a third may go
with us

  very sorry sir weve just booked the
last seat came the reply hold on just a
moment will you

  durant held on cursing softly to himself
giles appeared breathing hard

  off in five minutes he said durant
nodded then came the voice on the wire
hello i think we can take care of
you sir were sending over a d h special
to bring back a party of officials and we
can put you and the mail-sacks aboard if
you like would there be any trunks
no nothing but hand-luggage said
durant in sharp relief

  can do sir shell take off a bit ahead
of the regular bus though-about eleven-
thirty can you get out here by eleven
weve our own car said durant
yes we can get out by eleven or shortly
after

  right-ho

  durant hung up and glanced at the man
beside him

  special plane going over to paris we
must get to croydon at eleven you i
larson

  good said the russian ill arrange
to have the daimler picked up at the aer-
drome-its a rented car or dardent can
attend to that detail

  wed better all go out at once carry
our luggage pile in and be off said
durant the house is being watched-
youll have to make a dash for it and
throw em off

pvardent appeared waspishly excited
and the maid-in reality his wife-fol-
lowed helen glincka was on the stairs
and durant took her bags and set them
with his own

  itll be touch and go he said perceiv-
ing that the general feeling was that the
police were after them all naturally he
alone knew the actual facts depends on
getting off on the jump not a word of
anything wrong now before larson
helen well drop you at the savoy go on

to paris tonight via havre as arranged
youre in no danger dardent wherell we
drop you

  brompton road said the little french-
man our apartment is there-michael
knows

  good heres larson all together
now-out to the car pile in anyhow

and how michael drove out through
victoria and on to croydon durant
marveled at it no american accustomed
to wide highways and a gradual sweep
around other cars could have tooled a car
at any speed along these narrow english
lanes except with long practice with a
head-on collision apparently imminent each
car would give a jerky twist out and back
-and they would be past there was a pe-
culiar knack to it and the russian had
this knack at his fingers ends

  why the general rush inquired lar-
son when the two of them were alone in the
car everybody seemed in a devil of a
hurry to get gone 

  durant had already prepared for this
and broke into a laugh

  we had to get out quickly-so i told
em the cook had developed smallpox
cleared out the maid and all as you saw
our pleasant chauffeur goes over with us
heres my bag-ill get out your money
wrap it in this newspaper

  they suited action to word durant hav-
ing put his own bags inside the car with
a newspaper-wrapped bundle of sixty thou-
sand dollars in his lap larson relaxed and
lighted a cigarette now for the first time
durant had a good view of him and
whistled

  you certainly have changed yourself
hope you have your extra passport handy
no danger as to the change-thats a
cinch

  it was also a complete success to whicn
larson now added a pair of black-rimmed
spectacles with his mustache gone and
his hair changed from gray to a glossy
black he looked twenty years younger
eyebrows had become black too and sub-
tle changes in the outline of his face due
probably to wads of cotton against his
teeth gave him an entirely new look as
did the goggles-stamping him in london
as an american tourist

  now they had turned past the croydon
arms and the big car thrummed along
wide open until the huge gray hangars
loomed ahead they swung in between the
rows of low buildings and came to rest in
the parking-space beside the office two
planes were already warming up-a huge
silver giant triple-engined and a smaller
de haviland on the concrete take-off an
orange-brown french machine was just cir-
cling to land

  mr durant a crisp energetic
youngster pulled open the car door come
along and ill rush you through-planes
waiting now well have you off the ground
before the bus gets here for the regular
flight into the office please

  the car will be sent for said durant
and the other nodded

  there was no time lost in weighing
in and checking the luggage which was
sent on to the customs shed and put
through perfunctorily as it would be put
through at the other end in three minutes
they were crossing to the passport control
office the russian went through first and
as they waited larson jogged durants el-
bow indicating a man who sat beside the
passport officer

  scotland yard he said under his
breath now watch him

  he followed the russian laid down his
passport waited though it must have
been a tense moment for him with his
neck in the balance larson appeared quite
cool the scotland yard man glanced at
the passport glanced up at him then
leaned back and gazed out across the flying
field without interest stamped and re-
turned larson picked up his passport and



went on durant followed and was put
through without comment

  the three men stepped through the little
door and found their guide awaiting them
but as they followed out to where the ma-
chines were idling the russian fell back
arid joined durant in savage bewilderment

 whats it mean he snapped in
french that one and he jerked his
thumb toward larson then durant recol-
lected that he must have seen the others
altered appearance for the first time

  getting ready for paris i suppose he
said with a laugh

  ar-r-rgh growled michael korin
think im a fool

  the man strode on but in his powerful
features was stormy mingling of anger sus-
picion fear durant shrugged-what mat-
ter now he had already determined on
his course rightly estimating the russian
as one of makoffs chief aides who must be
put out of the way now or later it might
better be now only the fact of larsons
predicament indeed had prevented durant
from putting the london police on the trail
of michael korin

  when they reached the de haviland the
pilot was already in place testing his en-
gine-a youngish man with twinkling blue
the trail of death



eyes and a stubby yellow mustache their
guide turned

  alls loaded he shouted youll be
off at once

  this eight-passenger car was much
smaller than the big machines all but three
of the seats were piled high with luggage
and freight for the balance of the loads
was most carefully arranged durant was
given the empty seat forward larson the
one just behind and michael korin in the
rear larson shoved his newspaper-wrapped
package in the rack got rid of his muf-
flings and gave the staring russian a sar-
donic grin

  that grin durant reflected afterward
must have done the business-for korin
was no fool

  the roar of the engines rose to a cres-
cendo and abruptly the de haviland
moved-glided over the ground bumped
turned swept madly across the field
bumped again took the air a turn and
with the slight bank larson gripped his
chair-arms hard then laughed as he met
the eyes of durant

  new experience for me he shouted
michael korin sat slumped in his chair
frowning savagely eyes ablaze with sullen
fires as he watched the other two men
the altimeter crept around-one-two-
three thousand feet the pilot unreeled his
wireless antennae

  england lay below them

  the de haviland had the wind with
her and was doing her even hundred so
that in less than an hour the yellow sand-
beaches of the french coast showed ahead
the glass window of the cockpit showed
them the pilots head and a notice beside it
advised that it be opened for communica-
tion if necessary

  durant took an old envelope from his
pocket and pencil and began to write
his message was curt and to the point

  passenger hopper is michael korin who
  murdered grand duke vassily last year
  wanted by all police radio paris police at
  once to arrest him on arrival

  this done durant rose and went for-
ward he reached up and tried to open the
little embrasure but to no effect the pilot
turned shrugged and shook his head
shouting something that was lost

  unable to pass the envelope through
durant held it up to the glass the pilot
read it and his eyes widened then he
nodded comprehension and turned around
again craning up durant watched him

the blue

lean forward speaking into the microphone
set before him already the channel was
far behind the brown-green field-patches of
france flitting past underneath

  to durant it seemed to happen all in a
flash for he had been intent on what he
was doing and the roaring of the motor
drowned out all lesser sounds there was
a rush of movement the envelope was torn
from his hand losing balance he staggered
for an instant

  recovering he saw michael korin stand-
ing just behind him glancing at the writing
with inflamed eyes-durant clutched at it
gained it before the russian had read it-
or half of it at least in doing so he lost
balance again to the drop of the plane in
an air-pocket and went sprawling across
the freight as he went down he saw the
figure of larson limply sprawled in his
seat head sagging-dead or senseless

  korin read what was gripped in his hand
it was the top part of the envelope bearing
the first sentence only-but this was quite
enough a scream rang through the cabin
above the thrumming roar of the engine-a
scream of wild rage inarticulate bestial

  traitor shouted out the russian as
durant got to his feet vile dog of a
traitor what sort of trap have you laid
you want to have me pinched and get away
with the money yourself or-

  words evasion all useless here the
man was swept by a passion of insane rage
nostrils dilated lips drawn back in a snarl
eyes aflame he was out of himself for an
instant durant who was unarmed shrank
before the memory of how grand duke
vassily had died his throat torn out by
teeth as by the teeth of a wild beast and
here was the wild beast

  then braced durant leaped and drove
in a terrific blow to the stomach the
blow failed korin swerved snapped
hand to pocket jerked out an automatic
pistol durants fist smashed on his wrist
and the pistol fell then the two men were
reeling grappling striking locked in a
mad embrace hurling themselves about the
narrow cabin ih frenzied desperation of
fight while the earth rolled three thousand
feet below

rurant speedily knew that save for
l luck he was mastered no man could
cope with the insane fury of this wild beast
-for such korin had become though
durants fist hammered him relentlessly
sending crushing blows to face and stom-
book magazine



ach though he himself knew nothing of
fighting korin seemed made of living steel
twice durant got in smashes to the angle
of the jaw with absolutely no effect korin
flung him about as though he were a child
swept him off his feet with the sheer force
of a wild flailing swing picked him up
and hurled him against the cockpit wall

  then leaping on him korin got him
about the throat in a fearful throttling
grapple and reached for a grip with his
teeth frantic durant broke the hold
with the familiar jiu-jitsu break of arms
inside arms brought up his knee in a
deadly blow for an instant thought the
fight won korin staggered and durant
deliberately smashed him under the chin and
knocked him against one window smashing
the glass then even before durant could
follow it up korin was back on the re-
bound in another grapple with a wild
and shrill scream

  durant glimpsed the face of the pilot
staring back through the small glass inset
but the pilot was probably unarmed and
helpless to intervene helpless too to keep
the de haviland on an even keel for with
the wild rushes and swift movements of
the two men she was lurching badly the
newspaper bundle was swept from the rack
and packages of bank-notes lay around

  curtains were tom down windows
smashed the body of larson sprawled on
the floor and tripped them as they fought
then once more korin hurled himself in
and grappled bearing durant backward off
balance the plane lurched wildly both
men went headlong locked together- and
durant underneath was pitched head-first
into the wall this ended the fight for him

  when he woke up realizing that he was
not dead durant found that he lay half
doubled into a seat wrists and ankles
lashed with curtain cords if he had
achieved nothing else his blows had cer-
tainly knocked sanity into the russian who
was terrifically battered some little time
must have passed for as durant looked
he saw korin smashing the little glass win-
dow of the cockpit striking at it with his
pistol

  land his voice rose shrill above the
engine-roar as he shoved his weapon into
the face of the pilot land at once

  the air-man shouted a response which
durant could not catch korin was alto-
gether too sane not to know that his life
depended on that of the pilot-he dared not
shoot the little englishman who defied him

by h bedford-jones

he cursed raved threatened then with a
wild laugh he thrust out the pistol and
fired twice

  as the plane lurched durant caught his
breath thinking korin had shot the pilot
but the crafty russian had done better-
he had smashed the propeller

  the wild roar of the engine was suc-
ceeded by a swift and terrible silence
through which drove the voice of michael
korin in a wild blast there was something
splendid and magnificent about the man in
this instant as he stood watching the pilot
and laughed in exultation awaiting the re-
sult of his mad challenge to destiny

  now land you swine-dog land and
if you try any tricks youll get a bullet

  blast you came the pilots voice but
that was all the air-man was busy

lorin was beyond thought of anything

	now except the money scattered about
his feet and what would happen somewhere
in france three thousand feet below
he stooped caught up the packets of
notes stuffed his pockets with them then
straightened again

  durant realized now that given any half-
decent landing-place they stood in little
actual danger it all depended on the
landing place-but this was a big gamble
sharply banked the de haviland plunged
earthward gathering speed for the final
straightening out stmts and braces
quivered thrummed madly wind whistled
and shrieked through the smashed side win-
dows his eyes going to the altimeter on
the cockpit wall durant saw the needle
shake and turn twenty-five hundred-two
thousand-fifteen hundred-a thousand
feet the whole ship was roaring shiver-
ing shrieking to the wild plunge earth-
ward

  something stirred in durants brain-
wonder at it why would korin do such an
insane thing he must know that he could
not escape that mere landing would not
save him that at each moment the pilot
must have been reporting into the micro-
phone what was going on that on the
earth below must be a scurry of cars and
motorcycles police converging on wherever
the landing-place would be yet there the
russian stood furiously exultant carried
out of himself by the sheer sweeping excite-
ment of the moment pouring forth a stream
of laughing oaths as he held himself braced
and looked out upon the rising earth

  then the explanation swept upon durant
the trail of death



in all its simple truth korin as a matter
of fact knew nothing about the micro-
phone very few people did know that
these planes were so equipped all of them

  the needle was nearly down now korin
was waiting expectant hawklike the ship
came to an even keel floated-the pilot was
cursing frantically as he worked then
silence again a shout from korin a heavy
bump-and a crash no-safe the ship
was bumping rolling over ground slowing
down

  after this the end was sharp swift
dramatic enough even to durant who
could see nothing of what passed outside
the ship korin seized a suitcase and beat
out the glass of the broken window beside
him-needlessly for he might have drawn
the sash-and then crawled out the voice
of the pilot sounded

  here i say you cant do it you
know-

  korin laughed and the sound of a shot
brought silence

  a little after durant was aware of
larson bending over him fumbling at his
wrists shaking excited yet also laughing

  men coming said larson two air-
planes landing too-looks like a landing-
ground for the love of heaven durant
keep your mouth shut about the money
but he got away with it exclaimed
durant freed he sat up saw the high
radio towers and the huts below this is
abbeville just outside town-they can get
him i had the pilot radio his name and-
lay off cried larson frantically i
got to get to paris and drop out of sight
quick-beat it understand our pilot
aint dead-he only got a bullet through his
leg let em all think the fellow was just
trying to make his get-away-

  and let the money go demanded
durant incredulous

  sure let it go said larson with a
wink i got more of it let it go

  durant shrugged

nt ext morning in his little hotel in the
a  rue vignon behind the madeleine
durant caught at the echo de paris
brought with his coffee and rolls on the
front page was the story he sought

    michael korin the assassin of grand duke
  vassily was killed yesterday near abbeville
  by gardes champetres in a running battle

    it was no ordinary sordid slaying it was
  drama this great criminal was crossing
  audaciously from london to paris by avion

by h bedford-jones

  recognized by one of the passengers he
  brought the avion to earth by shooting away
  the propeller the pilot who was wounded
  sent the alarm by radio unhappily for him-
  self korin touched earth at the abbeville
  aerdrome

  durant thrilled laid down his paper
korin was dead then and since the
names of all air passengers were carefully
registered and the names of all hotel ar-
rivals in paris were at once deposited with
the police he would soon be traced here
and interviewed

  what of larson then durant chuckled
--for larson was gone he had slipped out
of the airways bus as it passed the gare
du nord after one hasty grip of farewell
and durant had last seen him darting into
the big station larson was gone some-
where like a rat hunting its hole why
he was safe enough here surely and he
had still some money left but what about
the money korin had taken surely lar-
son would claim it

  his eye fell on the paper again and fol-
lowed down to the final paragraph of the
story he read it with stupefied astonish-
ment the whole thing swept upon him
then with stunning force here he had the
explanation of larsons puzzling conduct-
and the most astounding joke on boris
makoff for makoff at this very moment
must be reading this news-story too he
would not understand larsons share in it
perhaps but he would quite understand for
what he had expended money and brains
prodigally not to mention for what michael
korin had thrown away his life

  bootlegging indeed exclaimed du-
rant mirth struggling against wonder and
admiration the clever scoundrel i bet
a dollar he was never fooled a minute about
lord northcote-i bet he was on to
the whole game and was playing us all for
suckers and this is why he wouldnt claim
the money and why hes probably outside
france by this time passing off his hun-
dred-dollar bills on belgians or danes

  for this final paragraph was curtly
pointed

    in the pockets of the dead assassin were
  found quantities of american bank-notes
  amounting to a very large sum the fact
  that they were in korins possession drew
  suspicion and upon examination they have
  been pronounced forgeries undoubtedly
  korin had intended passing them off upon oui
  good merchants of paris

  durant thought of what boris makoff
must be saying-and laughed again
at hell-gate butte

          the gifted author of captain jack the
          cloud king and the field of amber gold
          here offers another fine tale of wild life

         bigelow neal

winter in the bad lands the
black and gray and crimson of
lignite clay and scoria lay hidden
and cold under a blanket of white over-
head a star-shot dome of blue cold as
the white mantle below northward
stretching from horizon to horizon a gold
and purple banner trembled in the sky
slender lancelike beams of light darted
toward the zenith like tongues of flame
they flickered across the sky to pause to
tremble and to fade again under the
wavering brilliance of the northern lights
grotesque shadows leaped and played
among the turreted peaks

  and then another shadow a great shaggy
thing of gray moving steadily along the
canon floor-sometimes in a long bound-
ing lope sometimes at a slow stealthy
trot but always the other wild things
shrank from its path trembling for this
was the king of all the wolves-not the
well-known lobo but that uncatalogued
monster of the prairies known to the old-
time cattlemen as the buffalo wolf the gray
death of the bad lands

     a weasel tearing dry fibrous shreds from
  the bones of a long-dead deer heard the
  almost soundless footfalls of padded feet
  breaking off in the middle of his meal he
  looked and saw-and was gone a black-
  tailed buck trotting serenely about the
  nights business met the gray one face to
  face with a snort of fear he bounded high
  onto the slopes of a clay butte and disap-
  peared over its crest in a haze of flying
  snow from the depths of a washout came
  a coyote a male and hitherto the lord of
  the bad lands like the others he paused
  in wonder looked with fear and then
  plunged away into the night

     at the foot of hell-gate butte the gray
  shadow paused subterranean noises issued
  from that strange eminence and weird
  lights flickered odors too pungent and
  breath-taking drifted on the night air but
  the gray one was a female and heavy with
  young and though a stranger in the strang-
  est land of all time pressed skirting a
  sinkhole of bubbling mud she followed the
  steep course of a washout toward the sum-
  mit at last she came to a yawning cave
  
at hell-gate butte

and entered-and once more the night was
given over to the northern lights and the
long-drawn howl of a coyote from some-
where among the hills

f all the strange formations of that
geological nightmare known as the bad
lands this hell-gate butte is one of the
most fantastic many years ago presum-
ably a tiny spring bubbled from a vein of
lignite coal at the foot of the butte slight
as it was the flow of water was sufficient
to moisten a small area on the canon floor
grass sprang up and became a patch of
vivid green against the dead blue-white of
alkali and clay one day a tiny piece of
fluffy cotton floated up from the bottom
lands along the missouri river drift-
ing here and there on the freakish air
currents it settled at last on the moist
earth by the spring within the fluff of
cotton lay a seed the seed germinated
and became a tree the tree grew steadily
through the long slow years and in the
end a giant cottonwood flung widespread
branches across the face of the butte
then something happened the spring
ceased to flow and the great tree died
worms tunneled under the bark until it
fell or hung in shreds woodpeckers drilled
holes in the bleaching skeleton and it be-
came a haven of refuge for hornets and
weasels a roosting-place for the crow and
eagle

   one summer following a long dry spell
a storm came but of the west it was a
rainless storm-a dry storm as they say
on the prairie but what it lacked in mois-
ture it made up for in wind and light-
ning came a blinding flash of light and
the echoes of a thousand cannon reverber-
ated among the bad lands the great
cottonwood lay in a smoldering heap of
splintered wood across the vein of lignite

   the fire which the burning cottonwood
kindled never went out slowly but surely
like a malignant growth it spread to the
lignite and thence onward into the heart of
the hill as the coal burned out the
ground above became pockmarked with
caves and pits in some the air was dry
and clean and cool in others it was mixed
with steam and gas from the burning vein

   year after year the butte smoldered
columns of smoke and gas streamed up
along its weathered slopes and united to
form an ever-shifting halo above its sum-
mit at night the ghostly light of sub-
terranean fires played among the hills

the blue



  the name hell-gate butte was a
translation from the language of the red
man one night so the story runs an
indian was passing alone through the bad
lands he was fearful for the sound of
the winds drawing through those halls of
antiquity spoke eloquently of the moaning
souls in the white mans place of eternal
punishment rounding a bend of the
canon he found himself facing the foot of
the great butte and suddenly he stopped
frozen in his tracks for there before his
eyes were the portals of hell itself to his
nostrilscame the pungent fumes of sulphur
he saw the sullen glow of fires and among
them weird fantastic shadows danced and
writhed from somewhere in the bowels of
the earth came a low hiss a deep rumbling
growl and a moan of awful agony he
turned and plunged into the night as the
cowboys say he ran like the milltails ef
hell

lvtonths passed after the coming of
the buffalo wolf to hell-gate butte
and the grip of winter was broken
chinook and sun cut through snow and
ice and covered the buttes with a lace-
work of tiny streams hurrying down to
the missouri even the drifts on the north-
ern slopes holding out until the last like
delicately penciled eyebrows among the
peaks gave way to the warmth of spring
and with their disappearance came days
when the lower grass-clad shoulders and
ridges were gorgeous with the lilac and
blue of the pasque flower and now the
wild plum thickets the thorn-apple and
the choke-cherry bloomed as though at a
preconcerted signal and the air hung heavy
with the perfume of their artificial snow-
banks infrequent areas of sod became rip-
pling banks of green framed in the blue
and white of clay and alkali

  one night the moon swung clear of the
eastern horizon and the bad lands became
a playground of light and shadow warm
air drawing up from the lowlands along
the missouri brought shimmering protests
from the boughs of cottonwood and ash
the atmosphere was charged with the spirit
of adventure with the promise of new life
with the hope that rides on the bosom of
spring

   out on the moonlit alkali the weasel was
again at work on the bones of the deer
as he tugged at the shriveled hide he con-
stantly shifted his position that his beady
little eyes might keep unbroken surveillance
book magazine



by bigelow neal

over the other people of the night a jack-
rabbit hopping along the canon floor
stopped at intervals to thrust his nose and
tongue into the alkali in search of salt
seeing the weasel he jumped to the top of
a petrified stump where he sat up straight
and watchful his ears pointed to the sky
next came an animal in black and white
a small fellow carrying a plumed tail over
his back the weasel gave vent to a harsh
squeaking cry and fell back before the ad-
vance of his deadly relative but the skunk
on business bent ignored the little brown
fighter and passed in somber dignity to the
beginnings of a hole at the base of a
butte the skunk feared none for he
carried the weapon of his kind before which
even the mountain lion recoiled in horror

  then along the floor of the canon and
from the direction of hell-gate butte came
the hero of this story although at that
time there was little about him to imply
the part he was to play in general he
was fashioned like a puppy more slender
perhaps and differing too in the small
pointed ears as well as in the tail which
instead of curling above his back after the
manner of puppies tails hung straight down
until its point scarcely cleared the ground
under the moon his color-scheme appeared
a dingy brown but in daylight he would
prove to be fawn-colored excepting the
nose which was darker and shaded to black
around the nostrils

  evidently the puppy had inherited an
exaggerated sense of caution without hav-
ing had actual experience enough to be
afraid the shadow of a sage-bush caused
the hair on his back and neck to bristle
and stand erect while his lips drew back
to disclose glistening white rows of needle-
like teeth a moment later he was mak-
ing friendly advances to the sinister gray
form of a badger crossing the canon be-
fore him again it was obviously his first
adventure away from the protection of his
mother for at times when shadows
threatened the unknown he paused and
turned in the direction of hell-gate butte
while a whine of doubt and perplexity
formed in his tiny throat

  by the carcass of the deer he came to
a halt for the little brown animal with the
black-tipped tail and beady eyes was of a
kind he had never seen before and he
detected a musky odor something he was
later to learn as inseparable from the pres-
ence of the skunk mink and weasel the
scent stung the puppys nose and he

wrinkled his nostrils in disgust then he
sat down head cocked to one side eyes
fixed in mild curiosity on the activities of
the weasel

come minutes passed and save for the

   rasping of the weasels teeth on bone
and sinew and the soft scratching of the
skunk at the base of the butte no sound
broke the stillness of the night the jack-
rabbit dropped his forepaws to the ground
and crouched his black-tipped ears flat-
tened against his neck the puppy lulled
to drowsiness by the moonlight and warm
air dropped to his belly and lay with nose
extended along his forepaws watching the
weasel one eyelid closed he opened it
again the other one drooped he opened
that one too-but then both closed and he
was asleep

   from somewhere came a note of danger
a pebble dislodged from above rolled
down to the valley floor the rabbit
sprang away to the hills and the weasel
was but a streak of brown as he darted
for the protection of buckbrush and sage
there remained in sight only the skunk
still working undisturbed on his abode at
the foot of the butte and the puppy lying
asleep in the moonlight

   down the face of the butte crouching
low and moving silently a few inches at a
time crept a deadly thing the color of
molten silver at the foot of the butte
but a few feet from the puppy it paused
and made ready to spring a convulsive
tremor ran along its body under the
silvery skin powerful muscles rippled as
they glided into position

  the puppy was dreaming-dreaming of
the time when his mother had first taken
him out to hunt for mice in the valley by
the big butte he was in pursuit of a
mouse and his legs began to jerk spas-
modically he was gaining and the tail
of the mouse was almost within reach of
his nose another second and he would
have his supper with a mighty effort
he stretched his neck to grasp his prey-
but the mouse went down a hole he
jammed his nose in after it he couldnt
stop and his nose wouldnt come out with
a gasp at the memory of pain he awoke
and sprang to his feet-to find himself
staring into a face of horror

   he saw high pointed and tasseled ears
a hideously bearded under jaw a cruel
mouth with rows of saberlike teeth he
tried to run but was rooted to the ground
at hell-gate butte



by the awful fascination of the flickering
glare in the big yellow eyes for the
first time he had met a lynx and for
the first time he knew the terror of death

  disconcerted by the puppys sudden
emergence from sleep the big cat had
hesitated but now he crouched again in
a moment all would be over one blow
from the lancelike claws and the puppy
would lie senseless and bleeding at his feet
but a new actor appeared on the scene a
shaggy bounding gray shape that advanced
swiftly toward the lynx it was the terror
of the night the beast before which the
other wild folk fled in awe

  the big cat stood not on the order of
his going before a mountain lion he might
have shown fight but before this great
beast he turned and fled toward his den
in the sandstone ledges above behind he
heard a sound half-growl half-snarl that
rose and broke on the night air in a long
moan

  instead of retreating before this new-
comer the puppy advanced with whimper-
ings and whinings of welcome and standing
on his hind feet he tried to lick her
nose to the other animals of the bad
lands she might be the incarnation of
death itself but to him she was the source
of food and life of safety and warmth

  for a while the two stood there in the
moonlight the mother found a sandburr
tangled in the hair on the youngsters neck
she pulled it out and began licking his
face and ears

  in return he made playful passes at her
legs and tail after a time they fell to
a semblance of fighting and the noise they
made spoke eloquently of anger and blood
puppy growls and deeper growls that awoke
the echoes in the hills snarls that were but
ludicrous parodies and snarls that carried
fear to the hearts of other wild creatures
a mile away they rolled over and over
sometimes the mother on top and sometimes
the son when his turn came he buried his
tiny teeth in her throat and growled and
shook until he shook himself bottomside
up that was play all the play they
knew

at last the mother set off in the direction
of hell-gate butte and the puppy fol-
lowed but slowly for the night was still
young and he hated to go back to the gap-
ing hole in the clay he had tasted free-
dom and was minded to prolong the enjoy-
ment that was how it happened that he

the blue

fell behind and was still near the foot of
the butte when his mother disappeared in
the hole above finding himself alone
again he sat down to look and listen but
his musings were cut short by a deep
rumble within the butte he felt the earth
quiver and the rumble became a roar
rocks broke loose from the ledges above
and thundered down the slopes the sur-
face of the butte began to slide then
stopped and settled back into immobility
gas broke from a vent with a loud hiss
and a blinding choking cloud of dust en-
veloped him with a wild shriek of ter-
ror he turned and ran even as the indian
had run long years before

  miles away on the crest of another
peak the puppy stopped from exhaustion
back of him the air was still filled with
dust and he could see the dull glow of
newly exposed fires reflected on the clouds
there came to him a feeling of utter lone-
liness somehow he sensed that he had
seen his mother for the last time that the
heart of the fiery butte held all that he
loved and thenceforth he must face his
life alone the mournful notes of a turtle-
dove came from a tree below him and it
too was unutterably sad far away he
heard the staccato cackling of coyotes and
the anguished notes of their chorus in
fear of the night and the shadows and the
eerie noises about him he crouched trem-
bling against the earth

  all through the hours of darkness and
the day that followed and again through
another night the puppy made no move
under a projecting ledge of sandstone
partly hidden by sage and buckbrush the
little fellow huddled in a newfound terror
the world as he knew it had become a
place of horrors during the day he
feared the sunlight and at night the un-
known shadows every sound increased
his fears a thousandfold then as the long
hours passed he realized a new misery a
strange gnawing pain-something he did
not understand for he had never been
hungry the heat too increased his dis-
comfort and a burning thirst filled his
throat his tongue swelled until it was
too large for his mouth and when the hot
sun of the second day touched the already
sweltering sandstone above him he grew
desperate hunger and thirst drowned
even the fear of death he got to his feet
and staggered forth into the light of day

  slowly very cautiously he picked his
way down the face of the hill mostly
book magazine

he kept to the washouts and left them
only for the protection of buckbrush or
sometimes for the tall rank grass which
grew in the low places in this way he
came at last to a spot where dark-colored
water seeping from the clay gathered like
miniature cups of coffee in the tracks of
deer and cattle it was warm and brack-
ish but never again would he taste of any-
thing so good a little later under a
clump of joint-grass he found a shallow
pool scarcely longer than his body here
trying for another drink his feet slipped
and he fell into the water the touch of
the muddy liquid was cool and soothing
he tried going a little deeper and finally
lay down with the water halfway up his
sides

  with the quenching of thirst and under
the cooling influence of the water the
swelling left his tongue but his hunger in-
creased in time he grew restless and
started out again in search of food in
following a rabbit-trail through the under-
brush he crossed the air-lines of a scent
which spoke eloquently of something to
eat he trailed it up inch by inch and
discovered a great bird on a nest driven
beyond the realms of caution by hunger
he rushed in and sank his teeth into the
feathery breast then things began to
happen-there was a fleeting vision of a
yawning mouth-a cruel curved beak-
and a wing that shot out above him like
a burnished cloud a sudden stabbing pain
in the back of his neck another in the
loose skin of his flank and he felt himself
lifted clear of the ground and heard the
whistle of wind through vibrating feathers
he saw the earth falling away below
soon on a level with the highest peaks he
saw them also dropping away until they
became scoria-pointed needles protruding
from the floor of the abyss

  the pain in the puppys neck was un-
endurable and he twisted his head to snap
again and again at the great golden-brown
body above at last he felt something
tangible between his jaws there came the
snap of breaking bone the muscles of
the birds talons relaxed leaving the puppy
swinging from one leg like the pendulum
of a clock again and again as he stabbed
at the form above his tiny teeth were lost
in the mass of feathers on the breast but
at last he found a soft place behind the
ribs and he struck again the eagle
screamed then they were going down
sailing in great spirals the noise of whis-

tling feathers increased to a roar and the
peaks below were reaching up to meet them
like a flock of red-tipped arrows once
more the puppy struck with all his
strength and the steady roar of the wind
changed to a flapping fluttering sound
while a dancing stream of feathers sucked
after them from above peak after peak
shot by and up there came a crash the
splintering of branches then silence and
darkness

vyhen the puppy opened his eyes it
was already twilight and he lay for
a while blinking as though newly aroused
from a deep sleep a slight movement
brought a twinge of pain in his flank and
he turned to lick the wound the taste
of blood even his own drove him frantic
with hunger and it was then he saw the
form of the dead eagle dangling from a
low branch over his head he pulled it
down and ate-ate until his sides stood out
like the ends of a peanut at last when
he could eat no more and the bird was
still too heavy to carry away he set about
digging a hole to bury what remained
with the excavation only half deep enough
for its purpose he rolled in the big bird and
scratched the dirt around it the result
was obviously a failure and he spent an-
other long period carrying sticks and leaves
to cover the protruding feathers

   that night he slept curled up in a brown
ball by the side of the dead eagle in the
morning too thirsty to think of food he
went back to the waterhole returning
later for his breakfast he found the bird
gone nothing remained but a new scent
which puzzled him for it was not alto-
gether different from that of his mother
he followed it a little way through the
underbrush but being yet too full to hold
an interest in any one thing for long he
curled up and went to sleep again

tor a month or more the puppy lived
the life of a wanderer he found the
nest of the eagle he had killed and ate the
eggs that taught him to hunt for hawk-
nests they were plentiful and often acces-
sible to him in this treeless region he
had learned caution however and never
molested the bird but waited biding his
time until the hawk had climbed into the
air for its daily exercise in june he began
to find young cottontails and jackrabbits

   although of food and drink there was
then no lack still something was wrong
at hell-gate butte

nowhere could he find a friend enemies
everywhere but no one to whom he could
show affection lonely and desolate he
climbed one of the peaks and held a long
moaning communion with stars and moon

  that summer the bad lands sweltered
under a coppery sun waterholes shrank
until their bottoms were but barren areas
of sunburned mud buffalo grass which
had begun so bravely in the spring turned
brown and brittle and scattered like chaff
under the footfalls of animals during the
days of intense heat the puppy lay quiet
in the depths of plum or choke-cherry
thickets if it was too hot to go abroad in
the daytime he must perforce find his food
at night and so under the force of neces-
sity he reverted to the habits of his kind
and became a creature of the shadows

  one night he followed the tortuous
course of a canon one of the kind begin-
ning nowhere and ending in oblivion and
came to an open space between the hills
to a garden of geologic monuments giant
mushrooms of rock-capped clay stood
shoulder to shoulder a veritable graveyard
of antiquity a breeze sucking through
the canon drew varying notes of protest
from the grotesque forms of weathered
clay and the ensemble produced a wide
range of tones changing from moans and
groans to prolonged high-pitched shrieks
as the force of the winds dictated

-the eerie shapes and sounds strung the
puppys nerves to a high state of watch-
fulness and when he heard the metallic
scratching of sharp claws on a balancing
rock above his head he was ready and
sprang quickly to one side a long yellow-
ish cat-like shape sailed through the air
and struck on the ground behind him it
was his first meeting with a mountain lion
here was a time when discretion became
by far the better part of valor with all
the speed in his slender legs he leaped for-
ward into the darkness had he known
that a mountain lion depends almost wholly
upon surprise and seldom pursues its prey
the occasion would have called for less
effort but of this he was ignorant and his
imagination told him of pursuing footfalls
and a villainous mouth opened wide and
pressing hard on the end of his tail

  in this moment of extreme fear the
puppy reverted to instinct and all un-
knowingly turned in the direction of the
spot which had once been his haven of
refuge when he stopped at last and

the blue

dropped on his belly to lie panting from
exhaustion after his long run he was high
on the brow of hell-gate butte he had
returned to the home of his mother

with the approach of daylight the
puppy shifted his position and in
doing so ran across something which
seemed to merit investigation an aban-
doned badger-hole under a ledge at the
highest point of the butte for a time he
stood and studied the entrance a spider
web woven across its mouth gave it an air
of desertion and the puppy decided to ex-
plore cautiously stopping at intervals to
sniff and to listen he worked his way down
to a point where the tunnel opened to a
fair-sized chamber certainly the gods
were kind he had found a home where
he could lie secure and cool during the hot
days of summer

  but it seemed there must always be a
fly in the ointment for ahead in the dark-
ness he heard a sound soft and low like
the rustling of velvet and ending in a
sharp explosive hiss without stopping to
change the relative position of head and
tail the puppy retired with a fair show of
speed and took up his original stand out-
side the entrance

  sometime later the puppy had fallen
asleep a flood of warm sunshine played
down into the tunnel there was no sound
but the fitful buzzing of a hornet en-
tangled in the tattered spider web and
then up the slope came the occupant of
the badger-hole a big snake over seven
feet long with a body larger than a strong
mans arm he moved with a slow effort-
less motion and stretched himself beside
the sleeping puppy prepared to enjoy his
share of the sunshine his tail took up a
dreamy side-to-side movement that ended
by tickling the puppys nose

  opening his eyes the puppy rubbed a
paw over his nose and immediately drove
his teeth through the offending tail in
the smallest fraction of a second the scene
of peace and harmony became a battle-
field the tail jerked away and became a
part of hissing yellow coils surmounted by
a waving darting head and beady eyes
that glittered cold and deadly in the sun-
light but when the dust had settled the
soul of the bull-snake had gone to the
place from which a snake never should
have come in the first place and the puppy
remained in possession of the field and a
new home

wtonths passed and the puppy of the
buffalo wolf had nearly reached matur-
ity the fawn color had long since disap-
peared and in its place had come a gray
although his tail was darker and there were
yellow and bronze hairs along his sides and
back

  one night when he was a little more than
a year old he had joined a circle of coyotes
on a snowdrift it was the mating season
and a new sense of loneliness had grown
in his breast he came in peace seeking
naught but friendship but the coyotes were
not of his people and did not understand
one a male and the largest in the circle
snarled a warning but the warning went
unheeded the youngster was not think-
ing of war so he sat down and let his
tongue hang out a sure sign of peaceful
intent among dogs either wild or tame
the coyote thought the youngster was
afraid so he sprang forward and drove his
teeth through the skin of the puppys

throat a few minutes later the

puppy was alone again for the ring of
coyotes had melted into the night while
their vanquished champion had slunk away
dripping blood from a score of wounds it
was a victory for the puppy but an empty
one at that for from that time on even
the coyotes feared him and they were his
nearest of kin

a lmost two years had gone by since
that night when the landslide had
blotted out the den on hell-gate butte
the days and nights when the lonely puppy
had wandered through the bad lands in
search of food had gone forever for the
puppy had ceased to be he had grown a
massive frame and with growth had come
strength the additional speed of his
limbs and the crushing power of his jaws
had been translated into terms of more
food and food in turn had hastened the
process of growing

  in time he became a terror to the other
wild things of the bad lands one by one
he met the enemies of his puppyhood and
one by one they went down before him
the lynx whose attack had so nearly
nipped his puppy life in the bud was only
a thing of memory for he had left her
kicking her life out on the alkali there
was left only the big yellow cat from the
mountains-the lion that had chased him
back to the fiery home of his mother

  the time came when nearly all the game
had been frightened away and he had

found it necessary to go farther afield for
food and so had found a new enemy-
man where the coyotes killed sheep and
calves and turkeys he killed colts and
sometimes half-grown cattle in time he
became a scourge and a reward was placed
upon his head summer and winter he
was hunted he stepped in a trap and
escaped only by chewing the toes from one
foot after it was frozen once a bullet
broke his lower jaw and he was forced to
suck eggs from prairie chickens nests until
the bones had knitted but always his
marvelous recuperative powers carried him
back to health then in the end made
desperate by hunger he attacked and
killed a young stallion the property of the
government and the indians on the cot-
tonwood reservation the indian agent
organized both red men and white against
him and redskin trailers tracked him to
his home on the hill of the many fires at
last they were ready to strike

   the indian agent watched the signs of
the weather and then came a clear day
neither too warm nor too cold when the
moon was full and a light fall of snow made
it easy for the red trailers should their aid
become necessary by sundown the open
space before the agency office was a seeth-
ing mass of excited red men scattered
among the boys and youths of the new
generation was an occasional tuft of eagle
feathers marking the presence of a warrior
of the old regime modern rifles and auto-
matic shotguns were side by side with the
muzzle-loaders of an older time and once
the rays of the setting sun struck fire from
the polished blade-of a lance a relic of the
days when ree met sioux by the bloody
shores of the greasy grass outside the
reservation fence and beyond the hill of fire
other groups were forming white men
those waiting the signal to draw their lines
through the bad lands and connect at
either end with the lines of their painted
allies

   just before the closing down of night
a long column of horsemen moved out from
the agency to break up into groups and
glide in ghostly silence to their allotted
stations in the bad lands the cold twi-
light of night had faded from crimson to
gray and from gray to blue a curtain
hung along the western horizon for a
time the bad lands were illumined only by
the reflection of starlight on vast areas
of wind-carved snow but soon a dull glow
formed in the east pillars of mounting
at hell-gate butte



light radiating from a common center
spread fanwise above the skyline and the
blood-red rim of the moon appeared

  the peaks and fantastic forms of clay
glittered like mountains of jewels moon-
light played on the snow and among
the frost-crystals which shimmered and
sparkled in iridescent splendor while scoria
slides splashed the hillsides with blood

in the artificially heated air that hung
above the crest of the burning butte fleecy
streamers of water vapor floated back and
forth to chill and fall in showers of glit-
tering frost as they wandered into cur-
rents of colder air from the ice-filled valleys
below

  the mouth of the old badger-hole larger
by twice its original diameter and half ob-
scured by clouds of steam looked as aban-
doned and lonely as in the days of the
spider web the vapor thickened and the
mouth of the hole disappeared in a shift-
ing gray cloud then a current of air rent
the curtain of steam and the silhouette of
a great shaggy gray beast stood out against
the star-studded sky on the crest of the
fiery butte stood the king of wolves

as the curtain of steam lifted to show
the great animal at the mouth of his
den a cottontail far down the slope
darted toward his thorn-protected runway
with a squeak of terror a prairie chicken
rose with a flutter of protest and darted
away through the air-lanes of the night
from a clump of thorn-apples a black-
tailed doe sprang into the open to stand
poised a moment in the moonlight an
instant later she was in full flight while
behind her running nearly as fast and with
far more endurance came the great wolf
at the end of a mile the wolf had lost
ground and the deer was still bounding
high wasting her strength in useless effort
another mile and the wolf was holding his
own a third and he was gaining the
doe was running now head low ears back
giving the best she had but the best was
not enough it was late in the season
almost time for spring and the birth of her
young from behind her came a noise
not the shrill yelp of the excited coyote
but the low pitiless moaning bay of a
wolf putting forth all her strength she
darted over a divide and down into the
valley of petrified trees and giant mush-
rooms

  suddenly from the top of a balancing
rock a long yellow streak leaped into the

the blue

moonlight this time the aim of the lion
was good and there came the dull impact
of flesh on flesh for an instant the deer
and lion became a rolling tangled ball of
yellow and tan then the lion came upper-
most and drove her curved teeth at the
throat of the doe but they never reached
their objective for a great gray thing of
wrath and silent fury sprang across the
prostrate bodies and as he passed the wolf
drove his fangs in the side of the big cats
neck

  again and again he crossed and re-
crossed the tumbling pair each time strik-
ing with the precision and speed of light-
ning smarting with pain the lion loosened
her grip on the doe and turned to face her
assailant but this time she had to deal
with something more than a timid puppy
in the deadly glitter of his eyes she be-
held a hatred equal to her own in the
fangs gleaming white in the moonlight
in the high arch of the plumed neck where
the yellow mane bristled defiance she read
the battle-signs of the wild for a moment
she paused spitting and snarling and
scratching at the ground while her long
tail lashed the snow to silvery fog on
either side then her confidence returned
never within her memory had a living
thing defied the awful raking power of her
claws gathering her spring-steel muscles
she launched herself at the shaggy form be-
fore her

  a miscalculation of the smallest frac-
tion of a second on the part of the wolf
would have resulted in his being literally
flayed alive but he made no such error
without waiting for her to strike he
lunged forward and under when the big
cat struck the ground he was beyond
reach while blood spurting from a wound
in the lions side crimsoned the snow be-
neath her once more and still again she
tried but the great wolf was her equal
and more when she struck the ground for
the third time and before she could re-
cover her balance he rushed in and buried
his teeth in her back with a wild scream
of agony she tore loose and fled while the
wolf forgetting in his hour of triumph
the doe that had scurried from sight among
the hills stood in a snow-sodden pool of
blood and sent his song of victory ringing
among the crags and peaks above

  miles away where the bad lands gave
way to prairie a yelping coyote heard
the blood-curdling cry of the wolf and
breaking off in the midst of his song he
book magazine



slunk away into the night a night-
prowling porcupine stopped listened and
curled himself into a needle-covered ball
then as the great beasts cry of defiance
died away a hush settled over the earth
the hush of mortal fear the wild folk knew
that the greatest killer of all was abroad
and death hovered about them suddenly
from around a point in the direction taken
by the lion came a new sound the clear
shattering report of a rifle in an instant
another and then a spattering volley
once more the hairs on the great wolfs
neck bristled and when his ears caught a
far-away scream of mortal agony from the
lion he too turned and bounded away
afraid of nothing else that walked or
crawled among the bad lands he knew the
terrible menace of man and his rifle and
he ran as he had never run since the night
the lion had chased him back among the
fires of hell-gate butte

  mile after mile among the peaks and
buttes he still sped on at a long bound-
ing lope and driven by muscles which
acknowledged no superior he passed
through the scenes of his puppyhood along
the base of the burning butte and so out
toward the prairie beyond and then it
came again-the crackling of rifles the
whine of bullets the high excited yells of
men wheeling back on his tracks he tried
a new direction-but there once more was
the line of men he was running in a
great circle somewhere there must be a
break in this cordon of death somewhere
a place where he could slip through to free-
dom hour after hour he plunged on
desperately searching a chance to escape
the night wore on and paled into the
blush of dawn he was breathing heavily
running with his head hung low and his
swelling tongue impeded his breathing
daylight came and the forenoon passed
always his circle grew smaller and smaller
to the north and the south to the east
and the west it was the same-an endless
line of men and rifles at last when the
valleys were filled with a yelling mob of
red men and white he was forced to the
slopes of hell-gate butte

lie was a fair target against the butte
above and a haze began to form be-
fore and behind-the dust from flying
steel and lead a continuous rattle of
rifles below the monotonous moaning
whine of ricocheting bullets above up
and up he climbed until he gained the

by bigelow neal

highest pinnacle of the butte and crouched
against the ground to escape the flying
particles of steel and gravel

  here then was the end here on the top
of the burning peak which had always
been his home the last of the buffalo
wolves was to be riddled with shot and left
to rot on the slopes of the butte his
crime-the felony of being of living ac-
cording to the instincts of his kind he
heard them coming heard them climbing
the sides of the butte but even so it was
not ordained that mere man should boast
of killing the gray death

   down in the heart of the butte a reser-
voir of water had been forming through the
years without warning it broke through
and emptied its contents into the fiery pit
beneath the heart of hell-gate butte be-
came a vast boiler the pressure rose until
the weight of the peak became as nothing
the earth trembled fissures opened and
steam shot forth in wild hissing columns
the rock-crowned battlements which had
stood the wear and tear of centuries
toppled and fell dense clouds of dust and
smoke and gas poured into the air and
hung like a trembling pall about the crest
and base of the doomed peak the rum-
bling noise of falling rock and rolling
boulders swelled into a mighty chord in
unison with the high-pitched yells of flee-
ing men and then silence-a silence
more terrifying than the tumult of sound
which preceded it a breath of wind out
of the west and the curtain of dust rolled
back instead of the towering peak men
saw only a pile of tumbled rocks and clay
the fire which had eaten the heart from the
great butte had been smothered to ashes
and hell-gate butte was but a name

   the cattle-men tell the story of how the
last of the buffalo wolves lies buried be-
neath the ruins of hell-gate butte theres
another story told around the council fires
of the hidatsa of how a shaggy monster
rode the crest of an avalanche of rock and
clay a fearful gray shadow whose eyes
shot fire as it darted through the lines of
red men

  theres still another story this comes
from a land far to the west where rocks
are piled against the sky like the teeth
of a crosscut saw it tells of a female
buffalo wolf the last of her breed in the
rocky mountains and how for years she
wandered in and out among the crags
calling for a mate one night an answer
came-and she was no longer alone

the impressive story of a man with a hlot upon his
past who had built up a new life and a new name in a
far western community when-the past overtook him

pine valley reaching up into the
snow-rimmed mountains for thirty
miles above a bottle-necked canon
was one of the last comers of the west
to be reclaimed by the home-seeker even
the watery-eyed trapper found it a little
remote and inaccessible but joe som-
mers looking down into the valley from
the western rim over those towering green
pines found in the primitive waste with
its fertile trackless benches a haven of
rest a refuge of safety it held a promise
they will never find you here he car-
ried a rifle in the hollow of his bent arm
and a heavy pack on his tired shoulders

  since escaping prison where he had been
sentenced for life for the murder of john
baird-a man he had never seen-he had
lived in fear going from place to place
his savings of five years had been thought
to be the money of the murdered man and
circumstances were against him he was
left penniless he sought no revenge
against the law or society for the wrong
but he did want his liberty how he
hated that prison the stench the lock-
step everything here liberty beckoned
and he accepted the challenge knowing he
would ever be a hunted man in pine
valley he would be alone safe

  joe squatted on a hundred and sixty

acres of pine valley land as level as a
house floor and here he built a cabin of
logs drawn from the mountain sides the
tumbling water of the stony emptied into
the pine just back of his cabin door and
pungent sage and bunchgrass reached back
to the whispering pines

rfhat winter he set a line of traps up

	toward the summit on the stony going
up the fifteen miles one day and back the
next he always carried his rifle for sev-
eral cougar tracks crossed his trail after
each new fall of snow and occasionally
they followed him for miles while that
first winter did not bring a big catch of
fur-only four hundred dollars worth-
he learned the ways of the marten the
beaver the otter the lynx and the cougar
and best of all he kept busy

  late in the spring he tracked a big
grizzly over into fall creek and came
upon the fresh tracks of a man in the new-
fallen snow so he was not the only
occupant of pine valley this disturbed
him for he knew the relentlessness of the
officers of the law in running down es-
caped convicts he turned from the track
of the bear to that of the man as being
his greater enemy and had followed the
mans track not more than a mile when a
mr x



cougar took up the trail also in advance
of him joe now discovered that the man
was wounded and bleeding-for there was
a red stain in the snow where he had
crossed a gulch evidently the hungry
cougar was tempted by the scent of blood
helpless and wounded the man would be
at the mercy of the beast for though
the cougar normally runs from a human
being he is cunning enough to know he
can attack a wounded man joe hurried
on seeing the man struggling forward a
mile ahead of him plainly ignorant that
the cougar was following only a few rods
behind the injured man sat down to rest
under a projecting rock in the warm sun
the cougar poised above for a final leap
and before joe could bring his powerful
rifle to his shoulder for so long a shot
the beast had made his spring joe has-
tened to that scene of horror but when he
finally killed the cougar the mans flesh
was badly tom and his wounded leg was
crushed by the powerful jaws of the at-
tacking animal for weakened by the loss
of blood and a long walk to reach his cabin
after an accidental bullet-wound the man
had put up but a poor fight one hand
had also fallen between those teeth and
was crushed and tom he was half uncon-
scious as joe packed him three miles to his
own cabin and dressed the wounds

  the doctor brought in haste three days
later over the summit was unable to save
jack landons leg and the mangled hand
was left almost useless

  where you from joe asked jack
idly one day during his slow recovery
you havent always lived here

  oh no back east most everyone
comes from back there said joe fum-
bling the information purposely

  course i know that but what part of
the east persisted jack

  joe wrenched his shoulders as if to free
himself of suspicion it was only natural
that jack should ask but joe was alarmed
nevertheless for he was trying to push the
past into the haze of memory

  i was raised in a shanty among the
sticks of michigan said joe

  jack nodded thoughtfully howd you
happen to pick out pine valley as a place
to come to

  nice valley jack said joe laconi-
cally

  pines like they have back in michigan
maybe dont suppose many people will
ever come in here lonely place

by c francis burton

  as jack was permanently crippled and
would be almost helpless for some time
to come joe moved over to his own cabin
all the things from jacks cabin on fall
creek later on with rude skill he
whittled a wooden leg out of a dry sapling
and fitted it to jacks knee accepting
him finally as a member of the household

when government surveyors came into
pine valley and camped on joes
claim locating section corners and making
the country ready for settlers joes fears
ascended like a flame he didnt like those
little stakes they drove in the trackless
waste with the mysterious numbers on
them nor did he trust the men who put
them there for both portended the ad-
vance of civilization joe considered mov-
ing on as the only safe course where
could he go

  he talked it over seriously with jack
landon but jack welcomed the prospect
of a town on joes ranch

  i wouldnt be much good wandering
with this wooden leg said jack

  it was his friendship for jack landon
that finally decided joe on that evening
when jack said you only got a week
left to make homestead entry on your land
joe

  guess ill give the claim to you jack
and move on into the sticks

  jack thumped restlessly across the room
on his wooden leg what could i do with
land joe i got only one good hand and
one leg if you move on joe i guess ill
be going too

  joe considered the advantages of re-
maining there and taking the chance of
being discovered and betrayed as against
those of wandering into the primitive wil-
derness but as a man considers his family
his children their chance of schooling and
churches so joe considered jack he
could keep him here give him a home to
drag him about would be cruel

cettlers soon came streaming in op
the vanguard of what was destined to
be a land-seekers boom a wagon road
was started up the bottle-necked canon
financed by the forest service in conjunc-
tion with the state for those pines must
be saved from destructive fires before
the summer was over joe could see many
spirals of smoke curling forth in the early
morning before the breeze swished them
away
mr x



  late in the summer a family of five
settled on the hundred and sixty acres ad-
joining joe on the south and set up a tent
close to the river joe saw the smoke from
the evening campfire and sighed heavily
hundreds of people had attended his sen-
sational trial and the courtroom was
packed on the day of his conviction and
sentence to life imprisonment his picture
moreover had appeared in many news-
papers he feared recognition by the new-
comers

the second evening after his neighbors
arrival a girl came up and rapped at his
door i wonder if we could get some
milk for the baby we heard a cowbell
on the bench and thought you must have
a cow

  joes embarrassment and fear gave way
to a feeling of security for she was too
young to remember him had she ever been
back east sure i got plenty of milk
hard trip for a baby over the summit
how old is he

  nine months

  thats pioneering with a vengeance
said joe bringing in a gallon lard-bucket
full of milk it wasnt no easy trick
driving a cow over that trail either came
mighty near not getting here with her
rolled down one bank for fifty feet but
landed in soft ground thats all that
saved her mighty glad i got here with
her all right he said holding out the
milk for her to take

  oh i didnt bring money enough to
pay for all that she said refusing it

  this dont cost you anything said
joe eagerly scanning her face he was
glad young people had moved in close to
him

  oh im afraid mother wont accept it
for nothing joes eyes fell as if she had
struck him a blow

  we want to be steady customers until
we can get a cow of our own she added

  your mother he exclaimed wonder-
ing if by chance any fatal chance she
had come from michigan

  she glanced up quickly at his anxious
face then she laughed you thought
it was my baby did you it pleased
her to disillusion him for joe sommers
was still young and handsome and those
troubled depths in his eyes appealed to
her

  joes face went as red as the sunset on
the western rim jack thumped across

the blue

the room to the door and went toward the
stable oh how did your son get crip-
pled her retort using jack as a butt
for her revenge made the situation almost
ludicrous she laughed tantalizingly for
it was self-evident that jack was ten years
his senior he caught the humor of it and
laughed also before she left joe had
made a mutually satisfactory agreement
wih matie kay-she was to drive the cow
in with her pony each evening in exchange
for milk

  struck by an alarming thought joe
stopped her as she ran toward her pony
to ride back to the campfire by the river
where are you from he called as if
some great issue depended upon her an-
swer

  she stopped abruptly

  we came from the city im afraid
some one will have to teach dad how to
ranch

  ever back east-in michigan he
asked

  no we came from kansas fifteen
years ago and she rode home

  that was the pronouncement of liberty
to joe he was safe enough so far as they
were concerned but matie kay became
another and more insidious danger not
only did she drive the cow from the bench
each night but knowing her fathers in-
efficiency as a man of the soil she came
over to watch joe at work that she might
take home as an investment on their own
place some of his vast store of knowledge
about ranching

  joe began to have worried moments
she could never mean anything more than
a casual friendship could he bring her
under the shadow with him under the
judgment that might crush him any mo-
ment no he was not free but that
puzzled look she gave him sometimes
hurt

  i wish i could go trapping with you
joe and make some money to help out
there are so many things we need
matie said frankly one day

  i wish i could take you along joe
replied and i could if you were a boy

  do you wish i was a boy girls are
a nuisance in a new country like this she
said

  youve helped your dad a lot you
have told him how to do everything he
has done

  well ive told him what you said he
ought to do you seem to know how and
book magazine

when to do everything she said with a
sigh you dont need anyone to help
you

  well see about that said joe impul-
sively he regretted those words as soon
as they were spoken so long as this
prison term was hanging over him it would
bemerciless to ask her to share his life

 need to build a town of two thousand
 people is here that would make my
 fathers ranch worth a whole lot joe
 yes it would matie

 you are going to do it joe

 i dont know

 her eyes were cast down as she walked
 away joe muttered oh lord if i

-knowing that an officer might some day
come and lay the heavy cruel hand of the
law upon his shoulder come with me
he had heard those words a thousand
times come with me like a voice

out of the depths it persistedno

that would never do

lje made a wonderful catch of furs that
winter and the price was high most
anything he needed in this primitive coun-
try was within his grasp he made no
pretensions but people began to whisper
that joe sommers was rich

  when the road reached his place at that
narrow and crucial point on the pine
those who lived near by turned tcf him
with expectation and confidence that he
would start a town at the mouth of the
stony

  youre going to do it arent you joe
said matie joe had been her ideal too
long for her to doubt

  he hesitated people around here ex-
pect it of you she urged see what it
means to them we must have a store
a bank-for we will all have money be-
fore long though we have little now-a
post office and a hotel where travelers can
stop see what it will mean to everyone

  he smiled just your womans dreams
matie we may need a store he could
get no farther than that

  its not a dream joe everything you

the injured man sat down to rest
and-the cougar made his spring

could only do it-for her-and for them
that summer a man with a four-horse
team brought in a stock of goods and joe
gave him a building site on the new road
in the center of his ranch the doors of
the log building were soon opened and a
freight wagon was put on the road a
house was built for the storekeeper also
one for the freighter and a stable for the
horses then a call came for lots and
more lots stonyville grew like a weed
planted in that fertile soil the ten thou-
sand dollars joe had saved from his trap-
line began to grow rapidly

cteven dale a friend of the kays
came to pine valley early in the spring
seeking an opportunity to invest his
mr x



the blue

money he said-but in fact he had fol-
lowed matie kay with a definite object in
view finding her now a woman and a
very attractive one he decided to cast his
lot in stonyville

  he was not long in making his desires
known but when his proposal came with
her refusal matie as horrified she felt
entangled in a web and struggled to break
the meshes that held her tight for she
loved joe with all her loyal heart still
there was something about dale that was
hard to resist

  in desperation she rushed from the
counsel of her parents-who regarded
steven favorably-and hurled herself at
joe for protection she found him chang-
ing the irrigation laterals down in the
meadow

  oh joe i am afraid so afraid-

  susceptible to her every mood he re-
sponded instantly to her fears taking
her trembling hand he led her to the ditch
bank and sat down beside her

  what has happened my dear girl
can i help you

  only in one way joe joe i cant
leave here-and you she implored

  at his heart tugged joes secret that
barrier that must ever keep him silent

  oh joe you can only help me by mar-
rying me tonight it did not seem like
a proposal-but rather an answer to the
prayer on his lips

  sure i will matie ive been wanting
to do that for a long time but-but im
nothing but a trapper a lonely old trap-
per but he was smiling happily he had
not tom down the barrier-it had fallen
to let him pass

  you are not old joe not much older
than i am they dont need my help at
the ranch any more i must help some
one as god intended and i want to help
you

  bless you girl he reached out
drew her to him kissed her on the lips
for the first time he forgot all about his
past-and the shadow on his life

  though maties sudden marriage stung
steven dales vanity to the quick no one
would have known thaf he had received
a crushing blow for he was a perfect
master of self-control the reason for
his coming to stonyville was not known and
so little did joe mix with people that he
hardly knew of stevens presence in the
community until later

  soon after the marriage steven dale

sought joe out and made his acquaintance
matie now tied by the strongest of social
bonds watched this friendship grow with
some slight misgiving steven was destined
to be a power in the growth of stonyville
and knowing that joe needed friends more
than anything else in the world matie did
not warn him against dale but she did
nestle closer into the protecting arms of
her husband

three years time brought a daughter
then a son why not call him steven
matie said joe

  maties protest was just short of defi-
ance to refuse further might cause joe
to wonder why she should object so
vigorously

  you named the girl after your mother
matie i should have the right to name
the boy after my friend said joe and
while matie never openly consented to
that proposal she withdrew in submission
and let joe have his way

  if matie had one complaint to make in
her choice of a husband it was because
of his utter and persistent retirement he
would never go where crowds gathered-
for there were always new faces on the
streets of stonyville whenever he met
strangers on the street or when they came
to him for advice and counsel he was
troubled until reassured that they knew
nothing of his secret

  matie in her effort to push joe upward
to the very heights never missed a chance
at the civic league to make an excuse for
joes absence he works so very hard
he has so many things to do so many
people come to him she would say his
very silence and retirement surrounded him
with an air of wisdom

  mr sommers said dale one day at
the house while matie was rocking the
baby to sleep i have been around a
great deal-a great deal-

  joe started ever been in michigan
the question was forced by joes fears
why no-no stammered dale look-
ing at joe in an odd way for the quick
interrogation came with such intensity that
it aroused his curiosity

  i have been around a great deal he
repeated and stonyville offers the best
opportunities of any town i was ever in
it is not only going to be a thriving little
city but it will attract people by its natural
beauty and there is hunting fishing and
camping up in the shady pines

  joe assented we are surely growing
steven but he listened with misgiving to
the beating of hammers

i am going to bring all my money here

  	continued steven cast my future lot
with pine valley and try to make stony-
ville a town to be proud of and he
threw out his chest

  good exclaimed joe feeling that
steven could take his place as guardian of
the village people would not come to
him so often to borrow money stevens
counsel would be sought instead of his

  joe have you ever considered that the
banking business gives a man a standing
in a community which no other business
affords people in difficulty especially in
financial straits go first to their banker
he always knows everyones money stand-
ing a glimpse into a mans pocketbook
is a mortgage on his success in life stony-
ville needs a bank

  we would welcome you as the founder
of the first financial institution steven
said joe steven would be just the man for
that position he felt

  but i want your support joe financial
support as well as moral i want you to
be one of the first stockholders and a
director explained dale

  the request struck joe a stunning blow
would this bring him into contact with
people strange people

  matie put the sleeping baby on the bed
certainly joe will do this steven she
said coming so she thought to joes as-
sistance

  i know nothing about the banking busi-
ness said joe hesitantly

  ill decorate the wicket joe until we
need assistance im familiar with bank-
ing details so it was settled by steven
and the bank commenced to build at once
with joes name leading the founders
names matie felt very proud of him

  two years later found joe sommers a
wealthy man of affairs he owned the
lumber-mill up among the pines those
loved pines along his old trap-line he loved
the sawmill most of all though it hurt to
see one of those old patriarchs of the forest
prone upon the ground he established
a brickyard on the clay banks that stony-
ville might have better buildings he did
little ranching now leaving the oversee-
ing of it to jack landon with the affairs
of the bank the sawmill the brickyard
and the townsite joe was a busy man

  one of the first things steven did after
the bank was paying handsomely was to
build a church and he occupied the pulpit
delivering messages of hope and faith un-
til a minister could be induced to accept
the charge when one finally came it
was steven to whom he went to be ac-
cepted and steven was made sole trustee
as usual joe sommers refused to attend
where the public met so matie went
alone taking the younger child with her

  steven now established in the commu-
nity reverted to type-going back to
the days when he was courting matie as
a starting point for his revenge know-
ing that a difference of faith may create
a delicate situation in the home which
sometimes leads to -distrust and rupture
steven dale drove an entering wedge be-
tween matie and joe so cleverly that she
did not even suspect his purpose

  steven had created himself usher at the
church stationing himself at the vestibule
door to meet all newcomers and to greet
the older members he met matie at the
door bowing with a smile why doesnt
joe come to our meetings he asked

  oh she hesitated for she did not
know why-she refused to admit that joe
was an unbeliever in the powers or the
grace of god he doesnt care to come
she said simply

  dale wrinkled his brow you dont
mean that joe is an atheist he said

  that word caused matie to shudder and
to brush her eyes as if to tear away an
obscuring veil oh i dont know no
she defended stanchly he isnt but he
refuses to come and she hurried down
the aisle to her seat before he could es-
cort her much troubled she heard little
of that sermon dale was again at the
door when she left he met her with an
ingratiating smile and took her hand
holding it longer than was necessary

  im sorry joe doesnt come he said
with a tone that cut her

  he is taking care of alice she always
falls asleep when i bring her she said

  we need joe he said i cant think
of joe being an unbeliever people follow
joes example it should be one of faith

lwtatie never talked religion with joe
but the time came when she took her
problems of faith to steven dale and dis-
cussed them freely with him

oh steven you and joe are associated
in business ventures-and friends should
mr x



the blue

speak freely with one another wont you
appeal to joe for me he doesnt care to
meet people or mingle with them he
should belong to the civic league and
lodge joe should have been the one to
introduce the governor when he visited
us he should come to church with me
he knows haw to transact business with
people why should he not meet them
socially and publicly

  he should matie he should steven
sighed regretfully but in fact it was a vent
to his own misguided emotions pent up so
long in his soul

  wont you speak to him steven

  yes i will matie at the very first
opportunity he looked up at her i
would do anything for you-anything

  oh thank you steven but he did
not let her go

  i fear jack landon has a bad influence
over joe said dale he had long feared
joes friendship for the cripple he feared
jacks keen penetrating eyes his way of
digging below the surface of things into
mens hearts and souls

  you think steven that we shouldnt
have jack at the house i know he has
strange ideas upon many things she said
troubled

  a friendship that was founded in the
desolation and loneliness of pine valley
before other men came is not good for joe
you should have him send jack away

  but jack has only one leg and one
arm said matie looking upon the humane
side of the problem i dont know what
jack would do if joe should turn him
away

  it has gone beyond that matie what
will become of you and joe if he re-
mains

  matie was frightened by his words and
his tone i will speak to joe about jack
she said

  we were never taught to give our souls
in charity-only our money and things
of the world said steven holding her
hand in both of his own protectingly

  she withdrew it conscious of his pres-
sure upon it oh sighed matie if
joe only understood as you do if he only
liked to meet people as you do steven
her appeal tempted steven dale beyond
his usual discretion

  im afraid you should have married
me he said

  frightened she fairly fled leaving him
to stare after her once he had courted

  her parents-now he was appealing to her
through her faith

  matie spoke to joe about jack landon
but he would not listen and nothing came
of it but several hours of bitterness

  no he said finally jack is almost
as helpless as a child matie had taken
full responsibility for her demands-not
mentioning that steven had advised it
if your god is so merciless mine is not
said joe it ended there for matie real-
ized the danger of trying to make the
deity the author of her own selfish
desires

  the memories of the friendship welded
in the old trappers cabin were almost a
religion with joe

  while she never spoke again of turning
jack out her manner toward him changed
in a way that he was quick to notice she
no longer welcomed but merely tolerated
him

  jack put up a cobblers shop on main
street and moved all his belongings into
the back room it was not only his cubicle
-it was his world

rthen the terrible thing that joe som-
mers always feared happened just as
he had known it some day would the blow
at first shocked and then stunned him with
its intensity through the mail he re-
ceived a letter postmarked from the city
that paralyzed all his senses

  he was in the post office when he re-
ceived it tearing it open with nervous
fingers he read

  mr joe sommers

  you are an escaped convict sent up for
  life for killing john baird back in michi-
  gan i saw you the day you were convicted
  and sentenced i knew you the first time i
  saw you on the streets of stonyville-

  joe went ashen white and trembled like
a frosted aspen leaf in winters chilly wind
his friends noticed that he staggered out
of the post office clutching the letter he
had been reading in his room with the
door securely locked to keep matie out in
case she should come to inquire for the
mail he finished reading that condemning
letter

  im not going to send you back to prison
  if you do as i tell you you are in my
  power and a man that dont use his power
  is a fool i need money a lot of money
  and i need it very badly dont try to find
  out who i am or i will turn you back to
  the law for i wont take no chances leave
  five thousand dollars with steven dale at

  the bank for mr x and your secret will
  be safe

                               mr x

  for an hour he clutched that written
page in his iron grip and sat staring into
space no use to save that letter-every
word burned its way into joe sommers
soul like a brand he was helpless he
couldnt fight back he was tied one
false move and back to prison he would
g-

  he had no defense just a whispered

i have come to take you back to pris-
on frank leroy he said

word and all was lost there was no way
to silence mr x but to do his bidding he
thought of his children alice the older
and steven now aged five years growing to
manhood with the fathers promise of
honor and a respectable name he thought
of matie whom he had basely and cul-
pably deceived by his silence they were
his to guard against evil he must do his
duty to them at any cost better to leave
them penniless than to disgrace their
name surely mr x would go his way
when he had robbed him of all he pos-
sessed without visiting his greed upon his
innocent wife and children he knew he
must obey that summons at once

  he touched a match to that letter and
crushed the ashes in his palm leaving a
black stain he went out of the house
through the living-room passing matie
and almost ran to the bank to see steven
dale

  steven greeted joe through the wick-
et gate with a broad ingratiating smile
something i can do for you joeheasked

  yes steven said joe in a level con-

trolled voice i need a little money more
than i have to my credit i need it at
once his voice carried a peculiar mes-
sage of desperation to steven dale

  sorry to see you in straits joe
sympathized steven

  you have been wanting to buy the saw-
mill for some little time steven i am
ready to sell now on the terms you offered
a month ago it is paying well

  come into the office joe the trans-
fer of those beloved pines was soon made
what are you going to do with all this
money joe asked steven as a friend
naturally would

  i wish to leave five thousand here in
the bank for a mr x gulped joe steven
watched as if fascinated the misery of
that face across the table i believe he
will call for it

  oh yes yes said steven he was
in here to see me a few days ago said
you might leave some money for him in-
telligent-looking man but i had no idea it
would be so much a man of mystery
eh

  its all right steven just take his re-
ceipt for the money signed by mr x
steven smiled a little investment per-
haps that will pay you better than the saw-
mill and you dont wish to let your friends
in on it you foxy old money-grabber
chided steven who is this mysterious
well-dressed man joe

  but joe hurried home as fast as he had
come looking neither to the right nor the
left to greet friends if before he had
feared people he seemed now to hate them
in his distrust he seemed to see their
fingers pointed at him singling him out as
a loathsome thing

i etting business go by default joe no
longer went to the brick kiln or at-
tended bank meetings when people came
to talk of lots in his townsite he let them
rap at his door and go away he went
to and from his office through the alley
and entered by the back door here he
sat in the rear room dazed as one must
who waits to be hanged at dawn

  at the end of two months another let-
ter came from mr x demanding another
five thousand dollars by the time the
year had ended joe sommers had also sold
to steven dale his brick kiln and his bank
stock retiring automatically from the
directorate

  it was evident that mr x intended to
mr x



the blue

make joe a pauper what then would
he send him back to the penitentiary
surely he wouldnt be that despicable joe
thought as he weighed the disadvantages
to matie and the children of being poor as
against those of the disgrace which he felt
sure would result if he defied mr x and
refused to give him more

i ie had reached the point where he could

	 keep his secret from matie no longer
for she must now sign the deeds to the
fend and would ask questions but matie
had implicit faith in joes ability to handle
his own affairs and she signed the deed
to steven of the townsite and the south
forty acres of their valuable meadow-land
without question

  only their home and eighty acres of
land remained at first he had tried to be
cheerful in maties presence but no longer
could he conceal his troubles for deep lines
appeared in his face like those made by
the floodwaters of a river cutting through
the sands

  joe why is it that the men from the
mill never come any more to consult you
about anything she asked one day

  i sold the mill matie he said trying
to evade her gaze

  she started when

  about a year ago

  joe you never said a word to me
about it he saw that she was hurt and
offended

  i thought it best not to he said
simply

  who did you sell to

  steven

  she was thoughtful for a moment
steven is very clever with money mat-
ters i have heard that he is getting very
rich here everyone trusts steven
honesty pays these days

  joe agreed-he had lied to matie with
his silence that hadnt paid him

  and you never go up to the brick kiln
any more she said her words cut
through him

  i sold that to steven too

  she looked at him-just looked joe
he saw a glint of tears in her startled
eyes

  i sold the bank-stock too he said be-
fore she should drag that guilty secret from
him also

  and steven has the townsite and the
south forty

  yes he confessed i had to have the

money steven is about the only one in
stonyville who has money

  what did you need the money for
joe matie was one of those old-fash-
ioned women who believe that a husbands
failure reflects against the wife she too
had somehow failed

  he was face to face with that question
at last ought he to tell her of his disgrace
and brand her and the children i spec-
ulated with the money and lost he finally
said

  she considered a moment did you
give any money to jack landon when he
left two months ago she asked

  i didnt have any to give him

  she dried her eyes bravely well we
havent much left joe but i guess we can
make it yet but he had wounded her
sorely for it was plain that he considered
her a stranger to many of his plans

  for an hour joe sat there staring into
space he thought of flight as a possible
means of cheating mr x out of his final
revenge in the distant land of australia
he would have his liberty and matie and
the children could remain honorable in the
sight of their friends mr x would not
avenge himself against them

hthe next demand from mr x joe met
with bold defiance what little remained
must go to matie and the children he
went direct to steven at the bank and left
a letter for mr x telling him that he
would pay no more steven saw the deci-
sion on joes face his lip tightened

  you havent given this mr x a hold
on you joe inquired steven

  i have no more money to invest with
mr x said joe with disregard of con-
sequences and he went home to wait-

wait

  steven was more agitated even than joe
he went to the rear of the bank after joes
precipitate departure and opened the let-
ter left for mr x he wrinkled his brow
and opening a drawer of his desk he took
three news-items slightly yellowed with age
from a box those news-items had ap-
peared in a weekly newspaper printed in a
small village in illinois two of them in the
same issue

  the first read

  may th-john baird one of our most
  promising and ambitious young men left on
  the morning train for michigan where he
  intends to buy a farm he has long been a
  resident here and we wish him much success
  in his new venture
book magazine



by c francis burton

 at the bottom of the column appeared
another item of the same date in an en-
tirely different tone

    bill snooks left suddenly on the evening
  train but informed none of his few friends
  of his destination bill has been a neer-do-
  well in our midst for several years and has
  doubtless decided to seek his fortune among
  more gullible people we regret to say that
  bill though a likable fellow has been mixed
  up in a number of shady deals and has often
  been accused of too strong a desire to get
  easy money it is doubtful if we shall ever
  hear of bill again in this locality

 the third item appeared the following
week and probably had given the village
a shock

    news has just been received of the murder
  of john baird in a small michigan town
  where he recently went to buy a farm we
  have few details but it seems that john was
  carrying money about with him and was
  sleeping in a barn the night of the tragedy
  the motive was doubtless robbery for after
  the brutal killing the criminal set the bam
  on fire to give the appearance of an accident
  -but the skull found in the ashes bore evi-
  dence of a heavy crushing blow and also
  a bullet-wound just as we go to press news
  arrived that the murderer of john baird has
  been taken into custody and all the money
  recovered the accused man is a young
  farmer named frank leroy he lives not
  far from the barn where john baird had
  gone to spend the night we hope justice is
  speedily meted out to the guilty man

 steven dale smiled cynically	took a

piece of paper and hastily typed	a brief

letter addressed to the warden	of the
michigan penitentiary

    frank leroy who escaped from prison ten
  years ago is now living in stonyville under
  the name of joe sommers

                               mr x

  late that night when no one was on the
street and after the postmaster had left
dale dropped the letter stealthily into the
post office

  steven did not sleep well that night a
faint glimmer of light came into his
room past the comer of the church
where could that light be burning so late
into the night mentally he traced its
course over the harness-shop and down
toward the river and that bunch of cotton-
woods he gave a little start it was
joes window no doubt of it-joes sleep
was disturbed by his defiance of mr x
a hideous smile of triumph distorted
stevens face

  joe expected a threatening demand from
  mr x but none came during the next

few days then another possibility troubled
him he knew that the man who robs you
will ever be a most bitter enemy per-
haps mr x would feel safer with joe out
of the way safely behind prison walls

  joe made a determined resolution and
sought matie matie he said abruptly
i may be compelled to leave you before
long

  she looked up stunned leave me
what do you mean she would have
thought it jokingly said but for the look
on his face

  while she listened rocking the boy
steven harder and harder joe told her his
lifes story and told her of mr x

  i should have told you before we were
married about my escape from prison
matie i did try to but somehow the
words wouldnt come

  she stopped rocking and swept her
hand across her eyes it would have
made no difference joe she said at last
bravely

  i should have defied this mr x at the
very start-but i wanted to save you and
the children he looked down at the
sleeping boy neither could i bring my-
self to confess my guilt in concealing the
truth from you all these years my love
for you held me silent

  im glad you didnt joe but it would
have made no difference she looked up
with a start joe you are not thinking
of running away

  he wrenched himself as if to break
some bond holding him no he said
firmly but now you know why i have
never wished to meet people why i actu-
ally evaded them

  i understand joe forgive me but i
wanted you to go to church most of all
we shall both need god now joe

  after joe went to his room half an
hours meditation convinced matie that
only by divine intervention could joe be
saved to her and the children putting
on her hat and coat she hurried out

a big well-dressed keen-looking man
 about forty years of age boarded the
upriver stage at bend and took his place
in the rear seat evidently he was a
stranger in those parts for as the four
cayuses started out across the bridge and
up the dusty road he watched the passing
scenes with interest the treacherous road
ran alcfng the rocky bluffs of pine river
not more than ten feet above the rushing
mr x

torrent tumbling over huge boulders half-
way up the bottle-necked canon the moun-
tain scenery in the distance was closed out
by the rugged wall of rocks he now
turned to his companion in the rear seat
observing that he had a wooden leg and
that one hand was crippled to the point
of uselessness

  going up pine valley to buy land
asked jack landon casually

  why yes-if i can find anything that
suits me replied the traveler

  jack landon glanced at those soft
smooth hands and knew instantly that
this man did not come to buy land or to
make a home in pine valley

  if youre looking for land you want
to see joe sommers said jack craftily
as a feeler

  hes the very man i am going up pine
valley to see said the stranger

  youll meet a fine man in joe som-
mers you find em no better anywhere
pursued jack

  i have met him

  see that leg-joe extended the stub
of a native pine-and that hand joe
saved a cougar from getting the rest of
me said jack with enthusiasm

  ah you owe him very much said the
stranger

  for that yes and a great deal since
joe has one of the finest women-

  has he a wife thats too bad the
stranger caught himself up and tried to
explain joe sommers isnt the kind of
man who should have married

  you wont say that when you see his
two kids jack looked at the stranger
intently

  but the man only bit his lip thought-
fully children thats bad very bad
joe sommers should have known better
its going to be tough on them when they
grow up he frowned and turned to the
scenery for the bottle-neck was widening
with a distant view of the snow-clad peaks
jagged and rough in their rugged
grandeur

  i guess joe made a mistake all right
commented jack landon but the laws
made bigger mistakes sometimes

rthe right hand of the stranger went to
 his breast and clutched the handle of
something black what do you mean
he demanded authoritatively

  i mean your going up to get joe
thats his house there the white one his

by c francis burton



wife had it painted white see there where
the stony comes down through that gash
in the hills and empties into the pine
thats joes house his kids will be asleep
when we get there

  the officer who had come for joe som-
mers went direct to the white house and
rapped joe opened the door and he
stepped inside i have come to take you
back to prison frank leroy he said
drawing a pair of handcuffs from his
pocket

  joe had expected this moment so long
that he was unmoved by the announce-
ment im all ready i guess he stam-
mered feebly he was almost glad it was
over-that racking suspense it had eaten
into his very being

  id like to see my wife though before
you start back down the river she just
stepped out this is prayer-meeting night
and i expect she has gone shell say
fervent prayers tonight and many nights
said joe looking down

  all right frank its too bad you
married and have children

  ive got a boy and a girl whispered
joe almost as a confession of guilt

  tough on them frank i hope they
have a good mother you are leaving them
a little property

  joe looked up accusingly you got a
letter from mr x

  yes

  he got most of my property

  joe was glad that there were but a few
people on the street that they did not
look up to observe the stranger with him-
but joe had withdrawn into a shell of
poverty and was no longer interesting to
people

  it was a little early for prayer-meeting
when matie left the house but she wanted
to speak with the pastor at his home
she hastened to the parsonage but seeing
a light already in the church thought him
there she went in and turned up the aisle
seeing some one kneeling at the altar rail
it was steven dale who rose to his feet
on hearing her approach

  steven hasnt parson severens come
yet

  he turned when he heard her voice
he wont be here tonight so i came to
lead the meeting said steven observing
the worry in her face you are in
trouble

  yes she was silent a long moment
steven wont you pray for joe i fear
that something terrible is going to happen
to us on account of this mr x

  she saw an eager desire in steven dales
eyes that made her tremble you will be
all right matie he said if anything
ever happens to joe i will protect you
you her eyes flashed no not
you i dont want your protection she
turned and would have left the church had
not steven caught her gently by the arm

i thought you wished me to pray for
joe he said she stood a moment won-
dering if it would do any good for him to
pray for joe then she sank to her knees

  steven had scarcely begun his inter-
vention for joe sommers in a very low
and unsteady tone when they heard the
faint sound of steps approaching from the
vestibule entrance some one had come
early to the meeting and would take a seat
in the rear stevens invocation continued
in still lower tones but the intruder came
on up the aisle one step soft and low the
other a thud of a wooden leg upon the
carpet in the aisle

  steven stopped abruptly and jumping
to his feet turned to see jack landon
standing before him accusingly they
looked at each other a full minute-the
tension increasing when matie also arose



something in jack landons face prevented
her from greeting him after two months
absence

  praying for joe sommers were you
steven dale jack glanced at matie

  get out of here said steven flourish-
ing his arms threateningly you are an
atheist you will bring a curse upon me
a curse upon you steven dale
theres another prayer youd better make
before i leave said jack youd better
pray for john baird who was thought to
have been murdered years ago

  john baird exclaimed steven horror-
struck by this mention of the name he had
borne until he took that of steven dale

  matie wondered confusedly what it all
meant these two men had come into her
life from opposite sides one to draw her
against her will because he confessed her
god the other to repel her because he was
said to be an unbeliever

  i have been back to michigan said
jack i visited the little town where you
were supposed to have been murdered t
also visited the little town in illinois where
you were born ive got three news-items
here in my pocket steven dale would
you like to see them perhaps you could
tell something about the man who followed
mr x

you on the evening train the day you went
up into michigan to buy a farm

  no-who steven clutched at the air
with his fingers as if to tear down a pic-
ture that hung before his eyes-a picture
of struggle of a face distorted in agony

  so engrossed were the three that they
did not hear the people coming in to the
meeting and gathering about that strange
scene instead of taking their seats jack
landon had never before been inside the
church and his command over steven dale
now filled them with amazement steven
dale was crushed humbled-and the
crippled jack landon who had always
kept his own peace seemingly held some
strange influence over him

  the officer now entered with joe som-
mers and approached that little circle
gathered about the altar

  is mrs sommers here he asked

  i am mrs sommers said matie step-
ping forward to meet the stranger

  your husband wishes to see you for a
few moments he informed her

  steven dale trembled even more than
matie for he too understood will you
bring joe sommers here please said
steven shaking violently

  joe stepped forward he looked from
matie to steven and then to his old friend
jack landon but was too shocked by that
scene to speak even the words he wished
to say to his wife

  before the little group whom he had
so often counseled upon worldly and spir-
itual things in the presence of those
who had so long admired and revered him
for what he had done steven dale spoke
the words of self-condemnation that laid
him low in their esteem

  i am john baird joe the man whom
you were convicted of killing fourteen
years ago you had never seen me but i
knew you the first time i came to stony-
ville though i had seen you only once
god forgive me now as i acknowledge my
wrong before you

  he looked at joe

  your mill brick kiln and everything
else i give back to you joe i will leave
with the officer in your place i killed
bill snooks in self-defense he followed
me all the way from my home in illinois
knowing my careless habits with money
those were his bones not mine they found
in the barn i have my defense against the
law-and now i have my defense with god
in my confession

      sents a memorable drama
      wherein the various actors
      clash and connive in a most
      interesting fashion mr

      new is in fine form here

before thomas clobbam was re-
turned to parliament from one of the
east end boroughs he had done all
his letter-writing himself because mem-
bership in labor unions and workingmens
societies had given him far more of it
than the average man of the masses gets
in a lifetime it had materially improved
his diction and ease in expressing himself
like most of the labor leaders he prided
himself upon being a plain man of the
people-kept his bachelor quarters upon
the second floor of an unpretentious house
in stepney where he was close to his con-
stituents if not in the same borough-and
dressed as the average workingman does
upon a bank-holiday even when he spoke
upon the floor of the house during his
first few months as m-p- his correspond-
ence naturally increased to such an extent
that he was forced to get one of his polit-
ical henchmen to help him out with it
but this didnt work out satisfactorily for
either of them-the temporary secretary
finding it too much of a strain upon his
vocabulary and clobbam having to dictate
the wording of too many letters himself
he was therefore in a receptive mood when
the other man suggested his getting some
girl from the board of trade schools who
had been trained for that-sort of work

   itll be easier dye see for a gel like
that to write a lot o these letters when
yere not standin by to correct her be-
cause shell be eddicated for it-possibly

even better at the trick than you felley-me-
lad im thinkin ye should get her at
once

  ive thought of it dugan-but dye
see my people down here may think itll
be puttin-on a bit if i do it-imitatin
the toffs like

  naw-naw-nothink o the sort if
yere a bigger man this day than ye were
awhile back tis thim that made ye so-
theyll be expectin ye to do whatsomever
a bigger man does tis pride theyll take
seein ye livin an actin accordin to your
station-because tis thimselves yell be
represintin among thim toffs in the ouse

  could ye name a girl that would do
dye think

  well sir im thinkin ye might talk
with the schools super an ask im wot e
could ricommind ell be knowin wot es
got-an wot es ad the last year or so

in this way it came about that stella

	tupper was installed as the mps sec-
retary occupying a corner of his living-
room with her typing-machine during the
day and having such meals as she ate in
the house with his elderly quite respect-
able landlady below usually she went
home by five or six when she was busy
later than that the landladys eldest son
was always ready to see her as far as the
tube or all the way home if she permitted
it at first there was some comment in the
borough over their member going outside
for his secretary but when this got to
dugan he promptly gave an explanation
which satisfied everybody and increased
the general respect for their representatives
common sense

  yell be thinkin e should ave taken
mary riordan belike-an her so well ed-
dicated for the job or jane burns-wot
well dye see e says to me e says if
i do that tis pat murphyll be askin
wy didnt i tike is gel-whats eddicated
as good as mary or mayhap fred
thompson or steve grogan would be askin
me the same-they all avin fine gels as is
out o the schools wi fine ricomminds
twas to save ard feelin an give no cause
for complaint that e gits this outsider-
thats specially ricomminded for the job
by er teachers an the super

  so that was that as for the girl her-
self miss tupper was really much more
of a find than clobbam had any reason-
able expectation of getting

  when she had worked for a month with
clobbam giving absolute satisfaction in
her secretarial duties they got down to
a general sizing up of each other one after-
noon when the heat was oppressive and he
suggested knocking off work she began
by asking some rather direct questions

  mr clobbam-what sort of a job was
the first you ever had

  pushing a car in one of the northern
coal-pits

  and then what

  sorter-at the screens an chutes
then pick and shovel on the vein itself
foreman afterward

  and-work for the unions next

  no i wished to see what the big out-
side was like-as most lads do shipped
before the mast in one of the liverpool
sailing packets-better than three years
the master was a tall one for boxin-
could handle any man on the ship-en-

couraged us to get up sparrin-matches-
taught us a good bit of the science dye
see

  and gave you the good sportsmanship
of fair-play-which ive been rather won-
dering where you got

  aye-boxin will teach a man that if
hes straight in other ways came a time
-twas in brisbane i mind-that id
enough of the focstle i went overboard
-dropped off the martingale one night
swam ashore with my clothes an savings
in an oilskin made for a sheep-range up
the queensland peninsula owned by an
uncle of mine hed not have known me
of course but identifying myself was main
easy i worked a few months on his range
nights we talked socialism which the old
chap was rather keen about-theoretically

i told him id been in the miners an sea-
mens unions-meant to have a go at poli-
tics when id worked my way back to lon-
don-said that conditions at the pits were
not what they should be he offered to
pay my way home but i would have none
of that-could have bought passage with
my savings had i been fool enough went
down to sydney an shipped in the stoke-
hold of a p   boat homeward-bound
from tilbury i took a couple of the
greasers up with me for introductions at
one of the locals with what id learned
at the pits an picked up at sea the reading
an studying id done in my watches below

i was able to pass a number of the board
of trade exams could have gone along
up easily an qualified for a third mates
ticket with a couple of months in naviga-
tion but the local was needing men of
my sort they saw id a way with me-
before a crowd so--from that time-ive
been a political  off an on

nd you kept up your reading she
commented in some astonishment

  well dye see-i had to there were
cases every day where i could see it was
giving me advantage in fact with a bit of
practice in watching my tongue i fancy
i might almost-

  go as far as you please yes-i fancy
you could-though theres more to it than
watching your tongue thats what started
me asking all these questions mr clob-
bam

  well-why but-well get to that
later itll be my turn now for a few ques-
tions you come from what we class as
gentlefolk do ye not miss tupper

the blue

  not quite i fancy thats a bit of a
compliment-the way you put it my
father was a draper in a small way-
southampton as a girl of ten i rolled
gauze bandages in dads shop he was
paid for all the government took and did
rather well at importing other war-material
from the states but after the armistice
everybody was too poor to buy new clothes
and the trade went down to almost nothing
until a man bought dad out for more than
it really was worth that paid for our
schooling-his lodge and other insurance
gave us a bit more after his death id
good advice about putting my share in rub-
bers so that ive a bit laid by for a rainy
day aside from what i earn of course
wed women of quality in dads shop every
day while it lasted i was naturally ob-
servant-listened to the way they talked
saw what their manners were like at
school i took on a few studies which usu-
ally are supposed to be a bit above our
class and paid a woman who was compan-
ion to a titled invalid to coach me in a lot
of the little things a well-bred woman is
supposed to know-and do-or not do
she had me visit her for a fortnight at
entlingdean castle and her employer took
a lot of interest in me-said i would easily
pass for a well-bred girl then-this berth
with you appeared to offer experience which
almost certainly would prove valuable later
on-

  as to-how how far do you expect
to climb in what way

  well-if you go as far as i fancy you
can mr clobbam your personal secretary
in time will be quite valuable to you-
worth a very decent salary with a con-
stantly increasing acquaintance among the
bigger type of people if you stop short of
that my experience with you will have
made me valuable to some other member
of parliament or some man in large in-
dustrial development-and i will have the
political acquaintance to recommend me for
such a berth you see i certainly can
be of value to you if you go up-i go
also ive constantly in mind your interests
first-and my own all the time youll
find me loyal if the time comes when i
cant honestly give you that kind of serv-
ice ill say so flatly-and forget all of
your affairs when we part

  you-er-dont expect to marry i
take it what

  oh yes i do every woman does
sometime-though she may get fooled at
book magazine



that but ill not be able to care for
any tuppenny man now-why had he
asked her that was his interest in her
anything but a business one and could
she mold such a man to the really big ac-
complishments you see he must have
at least as much ability as i-preferably a
good bit more i dont know such a man
now-perhaps i never will meanwhile-
im rather keen on serving my employer
and myself

ryye mind saying girl just what was
in your mind when we started this bit
of talk-the thought which made ye ask
about my beginnings clobbam queried

  no youve sense enough to under-
stand without taking offense dugan has
told me you feared your constituents would
fancy you were putting on a bit if you
employed a personal secretary-and what
he said to you about their point of view
well he was quite right was he not
youre their representative theyve already
made you a big man in a small way-
locally theyll be equally pleased to
make you a much bigger man with a wider
sphere of influence-with the full strength
of their backing you may act up to the
part or not as you please-but theyll pre-
fer to have you a good deal less the plain
vorkingman in speech and appearance-a
ood deal more the type who can meet
the toffs on their own ground-join their
clubs hear what they talk and think from
the inside-

  faith-im by no means sure of that
lass i fancy yeve the wrong notion of
their psychology altogether if they see
me talkin an actin like the toffs hobnob-
bin with em itll make them suspicious
of me-make them fancy id sell em out
if twas made worth the doing

  why not put it squarely-hear what
they say tell them its quite possible
that mixing in with the toffs may change
your point of view a bit-but that youll
tell them so man to man if it does-and
why say it will do one of two things-
make you understand the toffs side of the
argument and look for something in the
way of a compromise-or else prove to
your satisfaction that their arguments are
all wrong and give you inside information
which may be used against them in behalf
of the workingmen youll find i fancy
that as long as you believe yourself to be
straight and honorable youll convince the
majority of your constituents that you are

by clarence herbert new

begin to doubt yourself-theyll doubt you
too

  assume that i find youre right what
would you suggest in the way of getting
me to mix in with the toffs on an equal
footing

  first-theres a consideration which
might not occur to you the honorable
jeremy smithers and yourself are in some
quarters admitted to be among the most
influential leaders in the labor party-
the men who have a larger following than
anyone else its difficult to say how this
would prove up but i fancy its not wide
of the mark-there are thirty or forty
miners in the house but theyd rather
make a row than talk sense smithers
copies you in the way he dresses acts
speaks among his constituents he
wouldnt even get a secretary until your
example encouraged him to do it so if
you adopt a course to forge ahead and he
drops behind it will lead to comparisons
between you-make a good many fancy
themselves more certain of his interest in
them than they are of yours if you go
up smithers must travel the same road and
by much the same methods then there will
be less chance for criticism

  i fancy you make your point-the con-
tingency hadnt occurred to me smithers
an i work together very well indeed-
trust each other thoroughly keep side by
side in our attitude on the floor of the
house jolly good team-work-what
very good smithers is in on the proposi-
tion if he sees it your way what next

  there is no good reason why you two
should dress as shabbily as you do its
the accepted workingmens pose to be sure
but theres no real point to it go to a
bond street tailor buy good cloth of a
quiet pattern which hell suggest and
have it cut right when you get a few
suits like that dont make the mistake of
coming down to the east end in the old
ones-come down looking in a way thatll
make them proud of you get used to
riding in a taxi instead of a bus or the
tube when it will save valuable time and
be less tiresome have a good caterer
serve dinner here in this room for you
mr smithers and myself-every day for a
month ill show you how to use the va-
rious sorts of knives forks serviettes-
how to act when you take a lady out to
dine then well graduate to dinners in
some of the swell west end restaurants
for another month-where you will both
free lances in diplomacy



keep your eyes open to what the men and
women at other tables are doing-how they
are acting ill give you hints as to which
are quite the right sort and which are
very far from that aftenvard well dine
with friends of mine who have acquired
much better taste than the class they were
born in-i think they can manage invita-
tions for you to some of the worth-while
houses an mp is after all persona grata
nearly everywhere you know-if hes not
too impossible in his manners all of this
will not run to anything serious in the
way of money mr smithers is said to
be drawing eight hundred a year from
some patents of his which the collieries
are beginning to use and youve some in-
vestments outside of politics when you
could both afford it i would have other
suggestions to make

  such as-well what

  you should have a valet-a man who
knows the proper clothes to wear upon
different occasions who knows what is
good taste and what is simply impossible
not a bossy impertinent sort of man who
would try to make you believe he knew
everything but one who has served with
the right sort of people and really does
know such fellows when one gets a good
specimen are valuable for many services
that wouldnt occur to you

lob bam had followed the girl closely
--getting a mental picture of what such
a course of instruction would do for him

he had formed the habit of intensive study
and wide reading and knew that smithers
did something along the same line-
which explained how they had managed to
increase their following among the la-
borites the proposition tempted him
strongly but he was determined to sound
his constituents before going very far in
that direction it might prove a boomer-
ang stella tupper had discounted this in
her own mind knowing that a man with
his natural ability would go equally far in
other fields if his political following fell
off

  well lass ill think over what youve
said for a day or so it would be
worth the doing-no question as to that

ill sound em a bit on what they look
for in their representative

  oh before i go home mr clobbam
there is a letter that came in the morning
post which perhaps you had best read-
in case it may be something of importance

the blue

its from a firm of solicitors in lincolns
inn-looked rather like a personal matter
so i didnt open it

  he slit open the long envelope with a
paper-cutter and took out a typed letter
which he slowly read through-and then
reread as though he doubted the facts
which it described in a simple formal state-
ment which had no appearance of being a
hoax miss tupper who had been glanc-
ing at his face occasionally asked if it
were anything serious

  why-aye in a way shock to me of
course-i really thought a lot of the old
chap-supposed him good for another
twenty years at least something wrong
with his heart they say my uncle out
queensland way you know died three
months ago executor instructed to sell
out his sheep-range and other property for
the best price he could get an send the
proceeds to me solicitors say this has
been done-the money placed in their
hands they fancy itll run to over a
thousand pounds a year-possibly a good
bit over if well invested

  youll take it of course

  nothing else to do that i can see i
was the nearest heir the poor old chap had
the more remote onesll not contest it
i fancy

  then ill offer one more suggestion
which this money will make quite possible
take chambers in some modern apartment-
building near westminster when you fin-
ish a sitting at the house after midnight
its a long journey down here to stepney
-your sleeping quarters should be within
a short walk of parliament if possible and
you should have a better place than this
to receive the big men of any party when
you wish a conference get down here in
the east end by nine every morning and
stay until one-meeting your constituents
and borough executives keep these rooms
meet them here as usual-stay the night
if there is occasion for it

this was obviously a common-sense sug-
gestion if he were committed to her
plan at all it quite appealed to him-
he saw its possibilities in arranging con-
ferences with various politicals what a
head the lass had on her to be sure
hed been in luck to get her in the
course of two weeks he had determined to
adopt her entire plan starting the course
of table instruction in the new apartment
where there was no risk of interruption

or any leakage concerning what they were
up to at the end of the first month the
results were noticeable and amazing

  much to the surprise of both men they
found that the consciousness of being as
well-dressed as any of the toffs in the
house gave them a sense of personal ease
in debate which they never before had ex-

the noticeable difference in his bearing and
leadership was not associated with his
clothes at all some of the other party no-
ticed that his suit while of much the same
coloring as he had been in the habit of
wearing was of finer material and perfectly
cut by a sartorial artist but this elicited
only passing comment

why-i suggested it my-
self i sometimes carry a
gun-and know how to use
it if necessary

perienced it permitted a full concentra-
tion upon the subject in hand with no sub-
conscious impression that they were in any
particular at a disadvantage although
neither commented upon the fact to the
other they now realized that the implied
inferiority which previously they had re-
sented by extra aggressiveness was probably
an inner conviction that in appearance upon
the floor of a deliberative assembly com-
parisons with the aristocratic class were
against them but now though there
wasnt the least slackening in the demands
they were making for the labor party
they were able by keen innuendo and
clever repartee to hold their own with some
of the ablest spokesmen for the other side
in fact clobbams command of subtle ridi-
cule and marshaling of his statements in
an orderly logical way more than once
gave him the best of it-drawing prolonged
applause from the galleries and even from
the members on the benches

it was a tribute to the excellence of his
tailors and his newly acquired valet that

  this was also noticed by two little groups
in the visitors gallery-stella tupper being
seated near enough one of them to recognize
the earl and countess of dyvnaint with
two of their more intimate friends and
catch occasional bits of their subdued com-
ments they in turn were near enough
two other men beyond to catch occasional
muttered remarks one of these two miss
tupper knew to be lord brilingdean from
his having called upon clobbam several
times in the past month but the man with
him was from his accent a foreigner she
couldnt recall having seen him before
they had been closely following the points
made by the two leaders on the floor and
presently appeared to be considering them
more seriously because of their evident
poise

  even stronger tan a few months ago
my friend yes remarked the foreigner

  not much question as to that i fancy
replied brilingdean but i cant make out

just what theyve in mind-ultimately
there has been a marked change in both
of late i never was more surprised than at
clobbams cheek in asking the marquess of
arlincom if he could recommend a really
first-class valet fancy a former miner-
chap-from stepney mind you-wantin a
valet not some bounder out of a berth
but a gentlemans man we three were
discussin the debate in a corner of the
lobby-i said id give him an address or
two later but there was no shuttin him
off he told arlincorn that his man mid-
dleton had struck him as bein exactly the
right type-hit the old boy in one of his
pet fancies-he thinks middleton quite a
perfect valet so he insisted upon havin
the man look up some one he could recom-
mend an send him along to clobbam

  our friend is really no fool yknow
pursued brilingdean --fancy hed the idea
that anyone i sent might be discussin his
affairs with me at times well-give mid-
dletons selection credit for the taste in
clothes and possibly a few other little hints
-that doesnt explain clobbam an smith-
ers dining with ladies at the carlton an
knowin how to handle the tools by their
plates or the ability to carry on a social
chat without making rather inexcusable
breaks of course theyre stronger than
they were why not-when theyve man-
aged to increase their personal value by
more than half cant be that theyre
lookin for a knighthood among the next
birthday honors-cause there seems to be
no pretext for it an theyd lose a good
bit of their following theres a woman
back of all this somewhere-im convinced
as to that but who is she what her ob-
ject may be whether shell block what we
expect to accomplish through these two or
not-i cant decide

  suppose tey ave discount ze loss
among teir following-look for sometheeng
bigger

  you mean theyd sell out first
place theyre both straight if im arty
judge of men theyre better leaders for
the labor side than they were before-
knowing how to argue against the con-
servatives along their own lines of attack
neither socialists nor laborites have any-
thing to complain of so far-quite the re-
verse but assuming that you may be
right who would buy their ability-for
what purpose

  it would be a eavy blow to ze labor
men if ze conservateeve win tem ovair

ze conservateeve wips would pay mooch
for tat i theenk

   twould be a criminal offense you know
-bribery no i fancy none of them
would risk it but if those two are as am-
bitious as they seem-not too scrupulous
as long as they remain within their own
party-im not so sure you couldnt make
them a proposition drinoviev

  myself i theenk of tat but-i wait
ontil you tell me you ave ascertain ze of-
fer would be keep in strict confidence-an
you are sure tey would consider heem

rthe earl and countess had caught but
occasional fragments of this talk but
were able to guess at what they hadnt
heard and form some idea of the relations
which might exist between the two men
lord brilingdean was one of those throw-
backs from his own order who openly aided
the labor party-an avowed socialist who
had converted all of his real property ex-
cept one small country estate into cash
which he had invested in rising securities
it was known that he had materially in-
creased his fortune and that he had given
large sums to the striking miners but how
much he actually was worth and how much
he had contributed to labor organizations
it had been impossible to find out miss
tupper failed to catch these almost whis-
pered remarks between the earl and count-
ess

  if actual business relations could be
traced out between some moscow financier
and brilingdean-eh george and if
clobbam were known to be handling much
larger sums than his recent legacy would
account for its really rather a tempta-
tion to go into this a bit myself might
turn up a lot the governmnt should know
-what

  what miss tupper did catch however
between countess nan and her two friends
was of sufficient interest to stick in her
memory though it gave her no hint of
what her ladyship had in mind

  youve met our lovely american friend
mary lester have you not helen said
nan lammy has at all events-hell
sing her praises to you half the night if you
let him a star of the cinema you know
-over here for a rest you meet her at
some of the best houses in london-per-
book magazine



fectly charming well here is a situation
she would enjoy immensely-and get a plot
out of it for one of her pictures whether
there actually is one or not suppose she
happens to meet our friends clobbam and
smithers of the laborites down yonder-
and lord brilingdean farther along the
gallery here-a turncoat peer who is
openly against his own class and order
suppose she builds up a supposititious tri-
angle between those three and her lovely
self what do you fancy would be her
reactions toward them more particularly
-what would be their reactions toward
her

  three men-fighting aggressive ones-
and a woman as beautiful as you say she
is replied countess nans friend coffee
and pistols i fancy

 rather intriguing-what do you
know im almost tempted-

  yes to do what

  see that the proper introductions come
about in an apparently casual way-and
watch what happens

  after listening to those two men on the
floor-quite excellent friends ive heard

-i fancy it might prove interesting to have
them introduced and see-how long they
would remain such very good friends if
they have political relations with briling-
dean as you rather imply see how long
those relations continue-eh i fancy
you might be rather keen about throwing
a brick into the radical machinery nan
-they certainly dont play on our lawn

i say could you induce your beautiful
american to come to me with lammy for
tea some afternoon this week youll
not want to appear in the affair of course
ill take her along to one of the houses
where either or all of those men are likely
to turn up she may not see as much
in the proposition as you do-

  but-she will its the sort of a
tangle shes frequntly done on the screen
-and shell enjoy pitting her wits against
theirs to see how hard-headed they may
prove to be ill make a bit of a wager
with her-just to get what she would call
more kick out of the affair

  stella tupper went home that night with
rather mixed feelings she was positive
that neither lord brilingdean nor his mus-
covite friend had caught a word of this
having missed the murmured remarks be-
tween countess nan and the earl she
hadnt the least suspicion of anything po-
litical in what that popular lady was plan-

by clarence herbert new

ning with the baroness the name mary
lester was not familiar to her until she saw
a picture at the cinema in which the lady
appeared it was supposed of course to
be none of stellas affair who the labor
leader met in society or how any particular
woman affected him but for the present
at least clobbams interests were her inter-
ests and she was beginning to feel an
increasing liking for the man as to bril-
ingdean stella would have been well
satisfied to see a break between him and
clobbam his lordship was beginning to
give her an impression of an unscrupulous-
ness which made him a dangerous man to
be associated with-though she had no ac-
tual proof of occurrences she thought might
have been traced to him

plobbams first impression after meet-
 ing the most beautiful woman he ever
had seen at a house in park lane was that
something not in the least understood had
happened to him for an hour he didnt
associate it with her-the introduction had
been too obviously casual for any prear-
rangement then he caught a glimpse of
her going into the conservatory before the
other guests had come back from the sup-
per-room-and followed she was seated
in a niche behind some low palms and
moved her draperies aside to make room for
him-and even at the risk of giving of-
fense he couldnt avoid drinking in the ex-
quisite loveliness of her although he
hadnt connected the undercurrent of gos-
sip with her before he now realized that
she must be the beautiful american whom
all of the guests were talking about in terms
of thorough appreciation-even the women
it seemed like telepathy when she presently
asked with a dimpling smile

   are you really a bit unusual mr clob-
bam-or is my imagination crediting you
with qualities outside of your equipment
why-er-fancy your asking that its
rather like what ive been wondering about
you dye see-ever since we were intro-
duced-though possibly i didnt realize it
until now of course therell be nothing
unusual about me thats pure imagination
very complimentary of your mind to work
that way im sure im just the ordnry
member from a workingmens borough-
with my work cut out ill assure you but
in your case therell be something ive not
noticed in other women not a ladies
man dye see-experience almost altogether
with men of the rougher type so possibly
free lances in diplomacy

im overstepping the conventions by put-
ting it so bluntly that ive had you in
mind the whole evening in some of my
reading on psychology i remember twas
stated that certain types of men always are
attracted by as definite types among
women however-pardon me-i fear im
not intresting you

  youre complimenting me rather plain-
ly mr clobbam but im honest enough
to admit that its not offensive-within rea-
sonable limits suppose i return the ball
if youre just the average mp from the
east end as you say how do you account
for the noticeable change in your manner
your appearance your grasp of debate on
the floor during the past three or four
months ive been in the visitors gallery
several evenings since i came to london a
few months ago

   if there really is any difference i fancy
i must give the credit to my secretary miss
tupper after she had been in my employ
a month or two it must have occurred to
her that i needed overhauling in spots at
all events i saw that things i said and
did appeared to annoy her out of curi-
osity i asked why-and she didnt hesitate
overmuch about telling me i didnt need
to question how she knew she was right
because her manner speech and actions
showed that she knew the difference be-
tween good and bad taste so i said id
take no offense if she went as far as she
pleased-with a deal of plain-speaking
my word i got some of it-no doubt
you must have had exceptional luck
mr clobbam-the girl evidently is a won-
der do you know id like to meet her
some day if it wont inconvenience you
nothing would give me greater pleasure
miss lambton  he exclaimed as he began
to see possibilities of tetes-a-tete with this
lovely woman

  we have luncheon at my chambers ev-
ery day when i return from stepney-
about half after one-sometimes with one
or two of the members dropping in some-
times quite by ourselves when there is
important work to be gone over i fancy
it would be conventional enough with her
as chaperon what

   oh i never consider trifles of that sort
in the states a woman can usually take care
of herself and her reputation-especially
if she is before the public in any way
which reminds me may i ask if you
ever are known by another name miss
lambton

the blue



  what gave you that impression

  well-i saw one of the american pro-
ductions at the cinema the other night in
which the star was miss mary lester-
they claim over there that she is the most
beautiful woman on the screen or stage
and-er-if you are not mary lester you
must be her twin sister really you know
you couldnt convince me that youre not
ive been taken for her by a number of
people if you fancy im mary lester i
shant bother to argue the matter with
you i was christened lucy lambton when
a couple of weeks old-so youre quite safe
on that name at least when am i to
lunch with you and miss tupper
tomorrow if youll be so good ill
put over a couple of members for another
week or meet them somewhere else 

che smiled openly at this as she said
see here mr clobbam have you a
strain of american blood arent you a
bit rapid for an englishman i didnt
know they could think that fast id like
to have the lunch with you as soon as i can
arrange it-but there are a few engage-
ments of my own you know and tomor-
row im motoring down with lord briling-
dean to his estate in bucks

  brilingdean eh it hadnt occurred to
me that you knew him house-party i
suppose

  not unless its a very small one he
said that some of the county people usu-
ally dropped in for the evening when he
was known to be at the place but were
motoring down by ourselves i fancy it
must be a lovely old house from his de-
scription-it was hinted to me that he
might eventually sell it as he has sold all
of his other property might be something
id like to purchase you know

  h-m-m-i rather doubt if it comes up
to your expectations his ancestral castle
in wales was a much more beautiful place
-ive heard an argentinian gave him twice
what it was worth i wonder if you would
humor me a bit miss lambton cheeky
to ask upon so short acquaintance of course
-but theres really an excellent reason for
it

  tell brilingdean youd rather hed take
at least one other couple down with you
americans find it very difficult to under-
stand the difference in viewpoint between
the two countries a woman can motor
half the night with a chap over there and
spend the rest of it in a ranch-house with-

out really serious comment-though one
doesnt quite understand how she does it
without getting into difficulties but over
here-well its done at times but with a
vast deal of personal risk it would be un-
pleasant for example if you found your
invitations to our best houses rather unac-
countably dropping off dye see all this
is no reflection upon brilingdean whom i

movements about the suite-putting the
evening-clothes upon hangers the shoes on
their trees laying out pajamas one ab-
sorbs luxurious habits very quickly and his
mind was full of smoky brown hair dark
eyes the most perfect nose and lips in the
whole world he was tempted to ask his
man what he knewr about her but shrewd
enough vaguely to understand that the sort

there came a
knocking on the
door-the wom-
en barely had a
chance to pick up
their belongings
and disappear

know very well-except that he knows he
shouldnt have suggested such a thing to
you

  why-i suggested it myself i some-
times carry a gun-and know how to use it
if necessary

  well-if you killed a man in the states
and were brought into court looking as you
do this evening probably any jury in the
country would acquit you its a habit of
theirs over there but in england youd
have to prove it self-defense or youd hang
-no argument about it and deliberately
putting yourself into the compromising po-
sition would weigh quite heavily against
you its really much the easier way to
avoid the dangerous situations

  in that case i think ill make some ex-
cuse to his lordship and accept your
luncheon-invitation for tomorrow ive
rented a nice little house in chelsea for the
season-come for me there at one if you
will-i have my own car

  back in his chambers clobbam was
scarcely conscious of his valets noiseless

of man he was trying to be does not discuss
his women friends with even well-trained
servants

  monkton the man came noiselessly
in with his dressing-robe

  yes sir

  one of my friends is having luncheon
with miss tupper and me at half after
one tomorrow i shall have her put over
to some other time the members who were
to be here-and you will see that i have
no other callers until four at the earliest
er-could you think up a not too elaborate
menu which would be exactly right im
rather keen upon having it something be-
yond criticism-flowers in the best taste all
that

  the man bowed

  with your permission sir i will see
the honorable mr smithers man before
breakfast and ascertain what he served for
mr smithers and a lady from the american
cinema on tuesday-so there will be no
free lances in diplomacy	by clarence herbert new



chance of following it too closely if your
lady should happen to know the other
party it was to have been very much the
sort of luncheon you describe sir-not too
elaborate but quite unusual then-if you
permit the suggestion in a maimer of
speaking-it will be most excellent prac-
tice if you block out for me what you your-
self fancy would be about right sir you
are showing very good taste in certain
ways sir-may be ordering for a party of
ladies in one of the smart restaurants al-
most any evening so that a nice discrimina-
tion in this line will come in very handily
if i think you are in error at any point
you will doubtless permit my calling atten-
tion to it icing a vintage burgundy for
example is a mistake one quite too fre-
quently notices in those who are inexperi-
enced

when the man had left him clobbam
felt a vague sense of disillusionment
the lady whom monkton had so discreetly
referred to as having lunched with smithers
could be nobody else but miss lambton
as far as he knew there was no other
american cinema-star receiving invitations
to the very best london houses at the time
-none who would attract smithers notice
to the extent of getting her to lunqh with
him in his chambers-properly chaperoned
of course no denying that her beauty and
fascinating manner would attract any man
lucky enough to interest her-he certainly
couldnt hold that against old jeremy but
he very much wished that he had known
her for some time first

  next morning he was driven down to
stepney an hour earlier than usual and
had returned by ten-finding stella tupper
at work upon the mass of correspondence
and political documents in his study he
asked her if she ever had seen or heard of
an american by the name of lambton
the name was vaguely familiar to her from
the social columns of the gazettes but that
was all he gave her some description of
what had happened during the previous
evening and the luncheon-appointment for
that afternoon-saying the lady had ex-
pressed a desire to meet her after hearing
what she had done for him stella experi-
enced a warm thrill at the mans honest
decency in speaking of this to a stranger-
wondered if she was occasionally in his
thoughts after all then he went on to de-
scribe the ladys beauty his blocking lord
brilingdeans insulting invitation-and sus-

picion came streaking through the secre-
tarys mind

  you say miss lambton is an american
are you quite sure that is her real name
as it happens-yes she is known in
the cinema as mary lester

  oh i saw her in one of the american
pictures last week-no wonder youre
rather batty over her looks i fancy about
a million other men are even worse and
shes really coming here in a couple of
hours my word im very highly com-
plimented knowing what she did stella
was nothing of the sort but she thought
it better sportsmanship not to tell him what
she knew and really-im delighted that
you blocked his lordship so handily i
detest that man hate him worse every
time he comes here hes up to something
dangerous somewhere-though i cant im-
agine what it is

  why do you know anything at all
against his character

  yes it may be to the advantage of the
labor party and playing your game for
him to betray his own class and come over
to extreme socialism give your organization
large contributions-all that but a man
who will do it out of pique against his own
order or for petty personal spite will betray
his country and his government to for-
eigners with just as little hesitation im
told that he has contributed thousands of
pounds-yet i happen to know of one case
where he evicted a tenant who had a bed-
ridden mother and a dying sister-turned
them out upon the road with what little
furniture they had i cant see how any
workingman can take a shilling from a man
like that and hes seen going about with
too many foreigners to please me-one or
two russians particularly

  h-m-m-youre giving pretty good rea-
sons for my instinctive dislike for the chap
stella id not heard of that affair with
his tenants nor of his hobnobbin with the
russians-but ive received from him sums
for our political organizations far in excess
of what it seemed he could have realized
from the sale of his property though tis
said he made a deal by speculation

a little later stella found miss
lambton charming-as much so in her
winning manner as in the artistic beauty
of her face knowing of countess nans
suggestion concerning a wager and that the
girl had deliberately arranged an acquaint-
ance with these three men to see what
ft	self in the

          private door

sort of a dramatic plot their reactions might
suggest to her the secretary was quite sure
that the lady had no serious intentions with
clobbam her admirers were far too nu-
merous wherever american pictures were
shown for that and if clobbam were
singed a bit in the game-well eventually
he would make his admiration platonic with
as good grace as he might all three were
liking each other better with each passing
moment and thoroughly enjoying the mas-
terpiece which the member and monkton
had concocted between them when the
house-telephone rang sharply monkton
answered it-saying that his employer
would be engaged until four and pos-
itively could see nobody until that time
he recognized the voice at the other
end however and finally was forced
to whisper in clobbams ear that lord
brilingdean was in the lobby insisting
upon coming up-a matter of importance
which must be settled before certain men
took the boat-train for dover that after-
noon as they had practically finished
their luncheon stella suggested that she
and miss lambton retire to the study until
clobbam succeeded in getting his lordship

out while they were considering this
there came an insistent knocking upon the
door-and the two women barely had a
chance to pick up their belongings and
disappear before monkton had to open it

  clobbam was very much out of humor
at all this and remained standing when
brilingdean came in

   i trust this wont happen again briling-
dean the house manager has seen you
coming up to my diggings so frequently
that i fancy he supposed it must be quite
all right when you insisted-but hell get
his orders from me pretty straight after
this now tell me wthat you wish-and
then take yourself off for the present im
annoyed i assure you

   really-i cawnt say i relish your tone
clobbam  this with a cold contemptuous
stare particularly when ive put myself
out gettin here to do you a service i say
wheres that girl in yonder have her
out send her away for an hour or two
what i have to say is strictly confidential
-ill take no chance of bein overheard
by anybody an there may be others here
to confer with us later

  this was a proposition which clobbam
didnt relish at all-seeing the obvious posi-
tion in which it would place miss lambton
if she were discovered in the study but
a thought occurred to him the next mo-
ment so amusing that it was difficult to
free lances in diplomacy



keep it from showing in his face calling
stella out c f the study he lockedthe door
and shovedthe key in his pocket-telling
her of brilingdeans request but when he
let her out he stepped into the hall for a
second and slipped another key into her
hand whispering go around to the little
side passage and let yourself in the private
door listen-but dont make a sound

yphen he returned his lordship had
made himself comfortable in a chair by
the window and had lighted a cigar

  clobbam you probably understand
that i am but one of several men in the
upper house who sympathize with the
aims of your party and are willing to help
it as extensively as our means permit-a
good bit more than youve received from us
yet in discussing the present situation we
believe it will not serve your interests or the
political conditions we wish to see brought
about if the miners strike is settled along
any of the lines under discussion we all
thought a blunder was made when you
called off the big strike awhile back-but
admitting for argument that the time
wasnt quite ripe for a show-down we are
certain that another opportunity will very
shortly occur in which you must push the
advantage even with extreme measures
now its said that you received a legacy
a few months ago but it probably wasnt so
large that you would be averse to having
your income increased still more-quite
materially more eh of course not no
man would youre valuable to us as a
leader-youre handling contributions hon-
estly without bond-and youve received
no consideration for these services but
unquestionably youre entitled to it-
smithers also very good in a nutshell
-if we make you both handsome allow-
ances for personal and political expenses
will you be advised by us in pushing ad-
vantage home when you get it will you
distribute for us sufficiently large sums to
keep the strikers and their families in more
or less comfort while they are out of em-
ployment

  how large sums-for example
  millions-if they are needed

  whos giving them where are they
coming from

  thats none of your affair-as long as
you get them

  i differ with you as to that british
money might be permissible-to the ex-
tent of preventing actual want among starv-

the blue

ing families foreign money is something
else again there are no labor organiza-
tions in the world in possession of any such
millions to give us russian money to fo-
ment and maintain chaotic trade disturb-
ance in britain is obviously unacceptable
every penny you give us must have an hon-
est pedigree before we accept it well
know precisely where it comes from
clobbam-youre a fool youre stand-
ing against your own best interests-
and youre in no position to take that tone
with me ten thousand pounds was what
we had in mind for your personal expenses
-more if you thought twas needed and
were asking nothing but what youre
preaching on the floor of the house are
you merely bluffing-up there

  no-were trying adequately to repre-
sent the workingmen of the united king-
dom all of them not-one little group
of soreheads we really arent getting
anywhere brilingdean and youll have to
excuse me now-im busy this afternoon
brilingdean sneered openly

  suppose i refuse to budge until youve
listened to reason from others who are com-
ing were quite in earnest clobbam
well certainly break you if were antago-
nized too far

  ill not listen to anyone else on this
subject-which is out-and-out criminal
bribery and if you dont leave my dig-
gings ill forcibly put you out of the build-
ing

  are you able to do that

  quite

  at the risk of my stating that you were
lunching here alone with a very beautiful
woman who had made a previous engage-
ment with me-that you are neglecting
party interests selling out your constitu-
ents because of an infatuation which makes
you useless for anything else he held
up a dainty glove which he had picked
from the floor under the table clobbams
eyes blazed for a moment-and then he
laughed

  why-aye-you rotter if i must take
that risk  suppose i must-though ill be
sorry for you if anything comes of it
youll not get out of hospital for some
time you see you insisted upon my send-
ing miss tupper out but nothing was said
concerning our guest-who has doubtless
overheard every word of your proposition
to me after your insulting suggestion to
her for this afternoon i rather doubt if
she will feel like shielding you at her own

expense frankly what you have been
talking is out-an-out treason against his
majestys government you know-

just then there came a loud and
nervous rapping upon the door when
clobbam opened it smithers hurried in-
looking rather upset when he saw his lord-
ship there-and then somewhat relieved

  hmph glad i found you together
now well be going into this a bit-confi-
dentially has he made any proposition
to ye clobbam

  merely tried to bribe me with russian
gold-stolen gold at that tried to force
us into using it against our own govern-
ment

  yere sure of that are ye tom how
are ye so

  brilingdean held up the glove-passed
it over to smithers

  perhaps from the lady who dropped
this glove shes a yankee americans
dont care what they say-never bother
about the proof

  its a liar ye are brilindean where
got ye this glove an when

  under that lunch-table-just now she
was lunching with him all by herself when
i came up-hed only time to lock her into
the study yonder lets have her out-
eh

  clobbam took the key from his pocket
and unlocked the door-in which the two
women appeared with disgust plainly show-
ing in their faces as they looked at the rot-
ter by the window who was giving an ex-
cellent representation of a man seeing more
than he bargained for smithers under-
stood at once that no possible impropriety
could be charged against miss lambton or
her host with miss tupper to chaperon
them-but the idea of her lunching with
his confrere in this intimate way upset him
more than anything had for some time

  as for brilingdean he contemptuously
felt that these two meddling clods had
done him out of a piece of goods so fine
and desirable as to be entirely out of their
class-or reach after he and smithers
had left the building miss lambton con-
fessed to her hosts that she had made their
acquaintance at first with the idea of see-
ing what would happen in such a mix-up
when it was evident that each of the men
had been paying her devoted attention-
but she added with a smile

  i think my experiment has done your
government a service mr clobbam even

if you feel that i shouldnt have taken this
liberty with you some of your foreign
office men were telling me last month that
they knew large amounts of russian mon-
ey were being used throughout england
but that they had no way of proving its
use for actual conspiracy against your gov-
ernment from what i heard this after-
noon however-and miss tupper took
down in shorthand-youve got that turn-
coat brilingdean with the goods as we
say in the states those notes with our
sworn affidavits will be in downing street
within the hour theyll probably be sat-
isfied to send the scoundrel out of the
country i suppose-but my friends the
trevors will publish the facts in full
through the news syndicate they control
as for you mr clobbam-let me say that
while i dont agree with your political
views i consider myself honored by the
friendship of one who has made himself a
gentleman of character and integrity
against rather staggering handicaps youll
remain my friend i hope for many years
miss tupper will agree to that i trust
yes-heartily but i fancy it had best
be hands across the sea hell not do
much political work or see anything in
other women as long as youre in england
to a man with a political future before
him youre a catastrophe miss lambton

a fter the two left the foreign office
that afternoon miss lambton dropped
stella tupper at her lodgings and was
then driven to the famous jacobean man-
sion of earl trevor in park lane
where she disappeared in the upper regions
-where miss lambton completely dis-
appeared until there should be some other
occasion for resurrecting her in the big
library after dinner countess nan gave her
husband and their two old friends a de-
tailed account of her impersonation when
they had stopped laughing earl lammer-
ford summed up these results

  youve exposed the channels through
which the russian gold was being distrib-
uted nan-and plugged it up for a while
at least youve sown dissension among
the ablest leaders the laborites have on
the floor of the house-and youve shown
the decentest one of the lot that his own
secretary may prove better wifely material
than even the most beautiful woman in
america-in the long run faith-i fancy
you might consider this the end of a per
feet day what

 a fool will rush in and crash the
 gate while an angel is waiting in
 line at the box-office

    that corrupted proverb explains in a
 measure how i came to start out on a tour
 of the national parks with two such hair-
 brained idiots as the eel and the tub
 christened respectively johnny holt and
 fenwick dallmoreton lurb i was a fool
 -no sane man would have gone a mile
 with them

    the matter first came up the day after
 commencement i was busily packing my
 sheepskin and my knickers anxious to get
 home and hang out my shingle proclaim-
 ing myself a full-fledged attorney when my
 two classmates burst furiously into my
 room

pack your clothes grant the eel or-
dered were leaving in the morning

    i surveyed johnnys lank frame scorn-
 fully for a moment as he draped himself
 snakily over the back of a chair

   no youre wrong im leaving to-
 night i told him

   fenwick dallmoreton lurb thrust his
 fat cherubic countenance in front of mine
 and grinned sagely dont contradict us

about nine oclock miss
carson comes over nothin
would do but i come and eat
a couple of quail

  grant you are leaving in the morning-
  with us

    how interesting i murmured without
  interest and where are we going

    the eel straightened up and told me
  briskly with much waving of his angular
  arms you and me and the tub are
  going to make a tour of the national parks
  together in my car we are going to take
  in yosemite valley grand canon mesa
  verde park yellowstone and crater lake
  we shall be gone three months and shall
  cover approximately five thousand miles
  between you and me it will be quite a
  frolic besides being a liberal education
  and heaven knows the tub and i need
  some kind of an education we didnt
  seem to acquire much here

    and who might i ask will pay our ex-
  penses for this five-thousand-mile trip i
  asked coldly

    the belmont motor company johnny
  holt declared pridefully

    elucidate johnny i ordered
  heres the dope the eel plunged on
  enthusiastically my dad is the proud
  owner of a belmont automobile i have
  just been in conference with the pacific
  coast sales-manager of the belmont com-
  pany he offered to give me one thousand
  dollars in cold hard cash if i would drive
  our belmont over the meyers grade into
  lake tahoe before any other car this sea-
  son the road is closed by snow now of
  
the tub plays sheik	by e whitman chambers



course and ive heard that there are three
or four cars up there near the summit all
ready to dash over as soon as the snow
melts a little

  naturally it means a lot to an auto-
mobile company for their car to be the
first over the summit youve seen the big
page ads that come out in the newspapers
every spring sturdy gazook four is first
car over meyers grade battling snow and
ice and mud this stanch reliable car
reaches lake tahoe on its own power
competitors for honor left stranded in
snow youve seen the ads grant you
know how they run only this year it will
be the sturdy belmont which wins the
ground-glass headache tablets and shell
be driven by john holt

the eel threw out his chest pridefully
  not bad eh kid

  i nodded skeptically

  and what makes you think you can
beat all these other cars

  ah johnny was very mysterious
thats the secret well beat em you
can lay your money on that i have an
idea which is bound to be a winner and
the thousand bucks will carry us on this
tour of the national parks which the tub
and i have worked out at the expense of
much mental effort

  a thousand will never do it

  course it will

  but think of the hotel bills for three
men the meals to say nothing of gas
and oil and tires

  were going to camp out

  and sleep on the ground

  under the stars the tub put in ro-
mantically

  and over a lot of rocks which pierce
holes in the small of your back i added
without enthusiasm

  in gods great out-of-doors the tub
remarked in no way discouraged

  my room at home is much more com-
fortable

  the great virile west where men are
men the tub persisted

  if youd show me some place where
men are tadpoles or ground-hogs i might
be interested in the contrast

  ah but think of it grant fenwick
dallmoreton lurb continued raptly out
in gods great open spaces birds trilling in
the tree-tops the soft murmur of moun-
tain streams the fresh smell of the pines
the low sigh of the night wind the-

  soggy flapjacks after a hard night on a
harder ground i finished

  dont pay any attention to the tub
johnny cautioned hes not responsible
you just listen to me you crave educa-
tion professor youre that kind of a
misguided mortal and what mans edu-
cation can be complete without a knowl-
edge of natures wonders well see em
all grant and well have our expenses
paid in the bargain its an opportunity
of a lifetime you cant afford to pass it
up

  but i dont like camping and poor
cooking and hard beds and long auto trips
and dust and heat and mosquitoes i ob-
jected strenuously now why not be sen-
sible you two boys go ahead i appre-
ciate your invitation to go along im
really very grateful but you dont need
me id only be in the way youd have
a much better time without me i wasnt
made for the strenuous life

  the eel turned decisively toward the
door

  were leaving in the morning grant
he said calmly leave everything to me
in the way of outfit and supplies all you
need to bring is a change of underwear
he threw open the door come on tub
lets breeze grantll come all right e
know him

  now listen johnny i pleaded give
me a few days to think this thing over
but johnny having pushed the tub out
into the hallway answered only by slam-
ming the door

i will admit right here that i must be
weak-minded certainly there is no
other explanation for the fact that i found
myself on the following morning wedged
between eel and the tub in the front seat
of an automobile which was racing swiftly
in the general direction of the sierra ne-
vada mountains

  unused as i was to the wild brand of
driving affected by johnny holt it was
a long time before i dared draw a deep
breath when at last we were compelled
to wait for a freight-train to cross the high-
way i glanced about the car and took
stock of my surroundings escape i saw
at once was impossible with fenwick
dallmoreton lurbs great bulk barring one
door and the eel barring the other i knew
that any attempt to dive from the car to
the comparative safety of the pavement
would be promptly frustrated
the tub plays sheik

  the tonneau i saw was piled high with
a miscellaneous assortment of luggage and
camping equipment heaped in heteroge-
neous disarray strapped on the fenders
next to the driver were four boards quite
heavy and some twelve or fourteen feet
long on one side of each board along
both edges thick strips of wood had been
nailed on the other side a large number
of heavy spikes protruded

  i glanced ahead saw that the road was
still blocked and broached a question
what is the idea of the boards
johnny smiled blandly one hand leav-
ing the wheel and patting the planks

  the boards my dear professor are to
aid the sturdy belmont over the summit
of the meyers grade

  those spikes are apt to be rather tough
on tires i suggested

  for a phi beta kappa man you show
truly remarkable powers of reasoning the
eel returned the spikes professor will
be placed in the snow and will prevent the
planks from slipping when the sturdy bel-
mont runs along them those strips of
two-by-two on the other side form a sort
of a groove and prevent the sturdy bel-
mont from slipping off said planks

  i am beginning to comprehend the
machine is to run over the snow on those
four planks

  exactly professor they will be laid
down end to end the sturdy belmont
will run onto the forward set then you
and the tub working on opposite sides
will carry the rear set and place it up
ahead the maneuver you understand
may be repeated indefinitely

  cheerful prospect-for the tub and
me i commented

  not so bad as you think there wont
be more than ten or twenty miles of snow
to travel in that manner johnny an-
swered encouragingly say forty hours
traveling time two days

  working twenty hours a day the tub
groaned

  itll do you good johnny grinned
easily and think of the thousand bucks
that means three months in gods great
out-of-doors the virile west where men
are men

  aw dry up the tub moaned wearily

at six oclock that evening the sturdy
belmont pulled into the town of plac-
erville johnny drew up to the curb and
stopped

the blue

  we might as well camp for the night
just outside of town he told the tub and
me ill hop out and buy a couple of
steaks for supper

  the tub pointed a pudgy finger across
the street that looks like a pretty good
restaurant he suggested hopefully

  yes yes go on

  i was thinking we might take on a lit-
tle fodder here in town i aint very keen
about your cooking

  and spend four or five dollars when i
can get a perfectly good meal for about
a dollar and a half the eel came back
disgustedly not a hope you two birds
just keep your seats we got to econo-
mize

pinner that night was rather a sorry
affair to all save johnny holt-who
the tub averred had been born with a
cast-iron stomach which had been case-
hardened in maturity by synthetic gin i ad-
mitted without undue urging that the meal
was an atrocity a conglomeration that
would have made even a starving arme-
nian turn up his nose in disgust

  aw gimme a chance the eel growled
finally i have to practice up a little
dont i

  sure practice your head off the fat
youth urged we wont care so long as
you dont practice on us

  then suppose you do the cooking
johnny blazed

  fair enough ill get breakfast and
if it isnt better than this meal youve
handed out ill be willing to call off the
trip and go home now where do we
sleep-if ever

  the eel rose grandly from his camp
stool

  ah heres where i show you a little
woodcraft you boys put up the tent and
ill make you a genuine fir-bough bed and
ill guarantee it will beat any bed you ever
slept on fir boughs as you may or may
not know cannot be beaten as mattress
material

  i gazed about rather dazedly

  but there are no fir trees around here
the eel shugged his shoulders imper-
turbably as he rummaged through the ton-
neau in search of the ax

  oh a little thing like that never bothers
a real woodsman he grinned emerging
with the ax pine boughs are just as
good

  you mean to say we have to sleep on

a bunch of sharp pine needles the tub
gasped

  suit yourself there are plenty of nice
soft rocks around if you care to make your
own bed take your choice

  johnny went to work collecting the pine
boughs while the tub and i strove val-
iantly to solve the puzzle of the auto tent
darkness came over the little glade in

hoping what johnny asked suspi-
ciously

 that some one else wins the honor of
 driving the first car over the summit

 huh the eel grunted and skidded
 the car around a curve

 the snow gradually grew deeper merg-
 ing onto the road in places the car would
 have been in difficulty more than once had

johnny gripped my shoulder
and pointed to a gray car

which we had pitched camp and we were
compelled to finish our task in the glare of
the headlights by the time we rolled in-
to our blankets on a lumpy bed that was
composed primarily of sticks we had
ceased speaking to one another

  breakfast prepared by the tub was
somewhat of an improvement over
johnnys dinner-primarily because there
was less opportunity for our fat friend to
go wrong in the simple frying of three
slices of ham and twelve eggs by two
oclock that afternoon we had reached the
snow-line and the sturdy belmont was
plowing ahead through mud and slush

  looks better than id expected johnny
declared if this keeps up we wont have
more than a few miles to run on the boards
from the looks of this road there are
three or four machines ahead of us i
sure hope nobody has beaten us over the
summit

  that would mean that wed lose the
thousand and would have to turn around
and go home wouldnt it i asked ea-
gerly

  yes thats just about what wed have
to do the eel admitted

  well heres hoping

not the snow been broken and packed
down by the machines ahead we were
climbing fast now the foothills had given
way to a rugged country of jagged peaks
and ridges swept bare of snow by the
wind of swift streams swollen and muddy
roaring down the canon beside the road

  ah the tub sighed happily this is
the real mccoy

  johnny suddenly slowed the car and
pointed to the road ahead a quarter of a
mile farther on we saw three automobiles
parked single file in the road ahead of
the cars was a crew of men burrowing
into a snowbank that looked to be eight
or ten feet deep

  heres where we stop and reconnoiter
the eel decided he brought the car to a
halt in the center of the road the snow
being too deep on either side to pull off
the highway tub suppose you go up
and look around find out what cars
those are and what chance theyve got of
digging their way through were about
three miles from the summit so i dont
think we need to worry much we should
be able to take it easy and get a good
nights sleep before we start over the top

  the tub departed the eel and i never
the tub plays sheik



the blue

knew how long he was gone for we were
sound asleep in the car when he returned
he roused us with a war-whoop which
awoke the echoes

  well how does she look johnny
asked pawing at his eyes

  shes a knockout if you ask me the
fat youth burst out enthusiastically
say you never saw such eyes in your
life and a form thats got the venus de
milo looking like a spavined washer-
woman and lips say id give my
share of the thousand right now-
listen dumb-bell johnny cut in
tersely come down to earth i sent you
ahead to look over those cars and the road
and here you come back raving about
venuses whats got into you has the
light air gone to your head

  but i tell you shes a queen shes
one of the sweetest looking little mammas
i ever put my lamps on red-headed too 
who

  a dame up there in one of those cars

tohnny groaned tub id ought to
j split your block head open with a boul-
der just to see if theres anything inside of
it now get your feet back on the ground
and tell us how the road looks ahead
looks you cant see it its covered
with snow

  how deep does the snow appear to
be

  how deep oh deep enough to keep
those men working for a week before they
break through

  good what are the machines
the first ones a speedwell thats the
one with the girl in it shes with her dad
and her two brothers theyre on their
way to new york and thought the road
was open

  and the other cars

  theyre both factory cars five men
with each one theyre trying to beat
each other over the summit the whole
gang is working like blazes as soon as
they get to the top of the grade theyll
probably try to make a dash for it they
say the snow isnt as deep on the other
side theyre all working together now
though but say that little girl in the
speedwell-

  johnny turned to me with a broad grin
while fenwick dallmoreton lurb resumed
his enumeration of the charms of the young
lady in the speedwell

  it looks pretty sweet for us the eel

commented id say we were a cinch for
that thousand

  i nodded woefully my cherished hope
had gone glimmering faced by three
months of life in the great untrammeled
west i didnt care much whether school
kept or not

  guess we might as well camp for the
night the eel went on heedless alike of
my dejection and the fat youths perora-
tion theres a little spot over there at
the side of the road where the snow has
melted we can pitch camp there cook
up a fine dinner and get a good nights
sleep tomorrow will be a hard day
and tonight will probably be a hard
night i added feeling quite disconsolate
unless youve learned that three-inch pine
branches will never put the mattress manu-
facturers out of business guess ill cook
dinner i cant do any worse than you
did last night

  thank heaven the tub put in com-
ing to life

  thank heaven for what johnny
asked angrily

  that im invited out to dinner tonight
invited out to dinner where how
come

  oh the sweet mamma up the line asked
me to partake of the evening meal with
her and her folks fenwick dallmoreton
lurb answered airily

  fast worker arent you johnny
sneered

  sure am the fat youth admitted with
unbecoming immodesty at least thats
what the girls all tell me

  the eels answer was a derisive grunt
i was telling her about that alleged
meal you wished on us last night the tub
went on she just about laughed her
sides out anyway she asked me to din-
ner took pity on me i guess

  huh i dont blame her for taking
pity on you johnny came back and
i dont mean what you mean either
aw youre just jealous cause you
werent invited

  well i guess ill manage to get along
and one thing more you fat sheik if
you want papa to bruise you just let out
to those people up ahead what were here
for understand

  huh what do you take me for

  a dub of course

  well maybe i am but i had sense
enough to tell them that we were just three
innocent college boys trying to get along
book magazine	by e whitman chambers



they dont even suspect that were up
here to beat them over the summit
well keep that up and well be all
right but if they begin to get suspicious
theyre liable to pitch in and work all night
shoveling snow and you know what that
would mean dont you

  what the tub asked nervously

  it would mean that wed have to work
all night too

  then rest in peace theyll never find
out from me why were here not by no
means

it was just six oclock the following mom-
 ing when camp broken and the duffle
packed the eel unstrapped the planks
from the side of the car and laid them out

  well leave the road and get up on the
snow right here he decided by cut-
ting across the hillside and working over
there to the south we can miss the gang
ahead and save maybe a mile in the bar-
gain

  but theyre sure to hear the motor and
know what were up to i remarked

  let em by that time itll be too late
they cant shovel snow or buck through
it half as fast as we can travel on those
boards once we get under way therell
be no stopping us we ought to make the
summit by noon and three oclock this
afternoon ought to see us down in the val-
ley on the other side lets go

  inclining the planks from the road to the
snow-bank we worked the car off the high-
way and onto the higher ground at one
side from then on it was work unadul-
terated back-breaking toil sloshing back
and forth in the snow the tub and i
labored feverishly carrying the planks for-
ward the progress of the car while far
slower than johnny had anticipated was
ridiculously easy the cleats which ran
along the edges of the upper sides of the
planks kept the car from skidding side-
wise the heavy spikes held the boards
firmly in the snow

  at first we caught occasional glimpses
through the trees of the other machines of
glistening shovels and the flash of snow as
our competitors labored in clearing the
road then the sturdy belmont at the ex-
pense of much cursing and perspiring la-
bor forged ahead of them and out of
sight

  at noon the tub and i collapsed wea-
rily on the snow and demanded lunch
which the eel obligingly called forth out

of several cans and a box of crackers
after an hours rest we were preparing to
return to our task when we observed two
figures striding slowly toward us through
the snow the tub rose hurriedly to his
feet his fat chest expanding

  ah here comes miss carson and her
dad he remarked grandly hiked all
the way over here to see me well i
guess ill take the afternoon off my lit-
tle red-headed mamma-

  your little red-headed mamma will see
you indulging in hard labor if she stays
here five minutes johnny interrupted
and as for taking the afternoon off or
any part of it just you try to make a
sneak and see what happens to you just
try it thats all

  aw pipe down pipe down the tub
urged in a frantic whisper want em to
hear you makin a fool out of yourself
act your age you big ape

  miss carson and her father drew up
to the car the young lady was all
and more than the tub had claimed
she was charming in her trim riding habit
and high boots further she showed im-
mediately that she had no eye for anyone
save fenwick dallmoreton lurb the lat-
ter assuming his most gracious manner
introduced the visitors to the eel and me

  quite an outfit you boys have here
the elder carson smiled gazing at the car
and the string of planks quite ingen-
ious i must say who thought of it may
i ask

  it was my idea the tub answered
modestly

  and a brilliant one too miss carson
put in her great blue eyes never leaving the
flushed eager face of the fat youth johnny
suppressed a scowl

  well i wish wed thought of something
like that carson went on we might
not have to suffer all this delay oh well
were having a good time and enjoying the
outing

  yes indeed were having a perfectly
wonderful time miss carson agreed
isnt the air lovely up here

  great the tub seconded swiftly be-
fore either of us had time to get in a word
and the snow and the green trees
superb

  and all these trilling brooks
  marvelous 

  and these glorious mountains

  the tub hesitated an instant evidently
trying to call forth another adjective
the tub plays sheik



johnny saw his chance and leaped into the
conversation

  well guess its time we were getting
back on the job come on tub grab
the plank on your side

  mr lurb staggered a little his face
growing red

  tub the beautiful miss carson ex-
claimed is that what you call him
sure johnny answered gruffly
thats his nickname doesnt it fit him
what a perfectly terrible nickname
miss carson decreed edging back from the
eel if she had had on skirts she would
have drawn them back slightly i reflected

  come on tub johnny commanded
climbing into the car

t-he fat youth very red now gazed ap-
pealingly at the eel then seeing no
sign of relenting on johnnys grim counte-
nance he shrugged his ponderous shoul-
ders and grinned in rather a sickly fashion

  well i got to humor the lad he re-
marked easily otherwise he might get
mad and lay down on the job he has to
drive the car you know

  yes of course miss carson agreed
casting a scornful glance at johnny we
wont take any more of your time we
just dropped over to ask you to come to
dinner again tonight one of the men with
the dalmon killed some quail this morn-
ing and were going to have quail on
toast for dinner youll come of course
will i the tub beamed then more
grandly i shall be delighted miss car-
son

   sorry we cant ask all of you the girls
father put in but theres not enough to
go around

  perfectly all right johnny returned
his voice was coolly bland but there was
a hard glitter in his brown eyes now
lets get to work tub

  the tub grasped his plank reluctantly
and the sturdy belmont again got under
way the two visitors had disappeared
among the trees before anyone spoke
then johnny remarked casually

  pretty tough on you tub

  why what mr lurb puffed tug-
ging at one of the planks

  you wont be able to get any of that
quail on toast the last words were ut-
tered with unusual venom

  the tub raised up swiftly i smiled to
myself at the consternation in his eyes

  huh why not

the blue

  because you got to stick around camp
i miscalculated the speed were making
at any rate we wont make the valley to-
night well barely get over the summit
well maybe youll be kind enough to
tell me what that has to do with quail on
toast the tub demanded sarcastically

  its got just this to do with it
all three of us have got to stick in camp
and guard the car now that those birds
have a hunch what were up to theres no
telling what theyll try to do theres
liable to be dirty work afoot tonight
get out the fat youth scoffed

no foolin we got to stick together
no runnin off and chasing around with
red-headed mammas besides anybody
that would take a second look at that dumb
dora ought to have his head examined
what whats that the tub blazed
you heard me the dame is a moron
nobody but a moron would rave about
trilling brooks and glorious mountains
she has an appreciation for the beau-
ties of nature the tub declared stanch-

iy-

  she hands out a lot of apple-sauce if
thats what you mean pure mush
gush i put in grinning

  slush johnny added not grinning
aw you birds gimme a pain the tub
growled disgustedly and if you think
youre going to cheat me out of that quail
on toast you got another think coming
have i whatd your father tell me
before we left home answer me that
young feller ashamed to answer huh
well he told me that if you werent a good
boy and didnt mind me i was to put
you on the train and ship you home-via
freight collect johnny paused now
laugh that one off

  but the tub was in no laughing mood at
that particular moment nor as the after-
noon progressed did he show any inclina-
tion toward laughter i didnt feel much
like laughing either that afternoon was
sheer work

  at three oclock the sturdy belmont
reached the summit of the meyers grade
and started down the other side toward
the valley all of us heaved a sigh of
relief now at least we would not be com-
pelled to carry the planks uphill as night
gathered johnny saw that we would never
make the foot of the grade before dark
and he reluctantly called a halt

  and fenwick dallmoreton lurb ate
canned beans and crackers that night as

i had learned long ago often to my sor-
row johnny holts will was very strong

  well have to stand guard over the
car and the planks the eel announced
as we gathered around our camp-fire after
the evening repast as i said before
theres liable to be dirty work afoot to-
night that fellow carson looked suspi-
cious to me ive seen his face somewhere

great bellow johnny and i rolled over
and looked at each other something was
wrong we both knew that for the tub
had failed to waken us to stand our
watches

 hey johnny hey grant come out
here what the devil has happened
this in the tubs anxious tones

  the eel thrust back the blankets and

before cant quite place him but i
know ive seen him maybe it was that
time i went through san quentin i dunno

  anyway we got to stand watches the
tub will take the first one-eight till mid-
night ill go on from midnight to three
and grant can take the rest of the night
and theres to be no monkey business
understand tub if that gang does any-
thing to the car or to those planks were
through thats all so see that you dont
go to sleep on watch tub keep my
rifle in your hand all the time and if
anybody comes around the car pour some
lead into em and then ask what they
want get me

  uh-huh the tub answered disconso-
lately from long acquaintance with the
fat youth i knew that he was heartbroken
over the quail on toast dont worry
about me ill keep awake

  darkness settled down over the camp
and the tub settled down over the camp-
fire johnny and i turned in fully dressed
under a huge pile of blankets and coats
and sweaters we slept soundly worn out
by the days exertions

  daylight was showing through the walls
of the tent when we were awakened by a

the car headed
down the
slope out of
control and
johnny was in
that hurtling
juggernaut i

leaped out of the tent i followed him as
quickly as i could

  a fine kind of a watchman you are
johnny the tub began angrily i
thought you looked mighty sleepy when i
called you to go on watch at midnight
you probably never woke up at all and
now look whats happened the planks
have been stolen

  the eel took one glance at the machine
and then centered his gaze on fenwick
dallmoreton lurb the fat youth made
an excellent pretense of righteous indig-
nation shaking his fist angrily cursing
calling down the wrath of the gods on a
man who couldnt be depended upon to
wake up when he was called to go on
watch but to me watching him steadily
it was all too plainly a pretense
the tub plays sheik



  johnny endured the harangue in silence
for a time then he strode forward and
grasped the tub by the scruff of the neck
shook him lifted him off his feet and threw
him into a snowdrift

  tub your little stall doesnt get over
you never called me last night some-
thing happened now come clean and tell
us the whole story

the tub debated an instant then
seeing johnnys scrawny hand reaching
toward his neck again he burst out

  all right all right ill tell you only
keep those fingers off my neck want to
choke a man to death

  id love to johnny snarled feelingly
now tell us what happened

  well i was standing my watch nice as
you please the tub declared when
along about nine oclock miss carson
comes over she was kind o sore because
i hadnt come to supper and hadnt sent
any word fact is she was all put out
about it well i pacified her as best i
could but nothin would do but that i
come over to their camp and eat a couple
o quail shed saved for me so-mr
lurbs eyes fell-i went

  and while you were gone those bozos
came over here and stole our planks
johnny put in angrily

  the tub nodded yeh i hadnt been
gone ten minutes before i got suspicious

i came running back i found twelve men
in the act of stealing our planks well
you know me johnny i pitched into em
and say what i didnt do to that gang
why i had the whole twelve of em just
about cleaned up then i got hit in the
head with one of the planks and fell down
unconscious on the snow how long i
lay there-

  thats a lot of apple-sauce johnny
interrupted the narrative at this point
before you pitch into twelve men or two
men theyd have to be handcuffed and
leg-ironed i know just about what hap-
pened as soon as we were asleep you
sneaked off to sheik that red-headed moron
when you came back the planks were
gone and you were too scared to wake us
up and tell us about it oh i know you
you fat dub

  incidentally it has just come into my
mind who this bird carson is hes the
chap that drives the speedwell on all these
record-breaking runs holds the los an-
geles-salt lake record and the los an-

the blue

geles-phoenix record ive seen his picture
in the papers a dozen times and now i
suppose ill see it once more the other
two cars havent got a chance against him
once he really gets going and starts buck-
ing through the snow in earnest hes
just playing with em now hell probably
cut loose th morning that old wagon
of his will break through this snow like it
was tissue paper

  but the girl the tub objected
whats she doing on a trip like this
better ask her surely you dont ex-
pect me to analyze the whims of a red-
headed flapper the eel gazed forlornly
at the car now how in the name of
common sense are we going to get out of
here in an hour or two the sun will thaw
out this crust of ice and the old boat will
sink in the snow and if im any judge
its about ten feet deep right here where
shes standing and once she sinks in itll
take us a month to dig her out

  maybe you better try to drive her back
on the road the tub suggested hopefully

  road johnny grunted if you can
see any road around here ill admit i need
glasses its covered with snow the only
thing we can do is to wait till that speed-
well breaks through and opens up the
road then ill try to ease her over onto
the highway and ill be lucky if i dont
slide down the mountain you tub get
the chains out and put em on and one
more yelp out of you and ill brain you
johnny dropped onto the running-board
and buried his head in his hands the
tub set to work to put on the skid chains
i started to get breakfast and pack up

  a thousand bucks the eel moaned
think of it a thousand bucks shot to
the dickens all because of a rattle-brained
girl-struck dub its terrible-terrible
an hour later johnny gripped my shoul-
der fiercely and pointed to a great gray
touring car bucking through the snow
along the road a hundred yards away
the tub hat in hand was evidently seiz-
ing this chance to bid farewell to his little
red-headed mamma

  the big machine was making fair prog-
ress in an hour more two at the most it
would be at the bottom of the grade as
completely dejected as i have ever seen
him johnny watched it grind slowly past
a girl in the tonneau a red-haired girl
waved to him the eel cursed brokenly
got to his feet and climbed into his car
ill try to get back on the road now

he said dispiritedly you boys better
walk i may not make it if the car
starts to slide itll be curtains and
theres no use sacrificing all three of us

wisions of a wrecked car and the eels
broken body came before my eyes
johnny you better not try it i
pleaded you better not take the chance
shut up came hoarsely from the
eel i cant leave the car here until
summer can i he stepped on the
starter the motor hummed after a mo-
ment the tub and i jumped to one side
johnny waved his hand

  well so long boys if i dont-

  at this point the car began to move
not forward as the eel had intended but
sidewise down the mountain johnny
suddenly very white jerked on the emer-
gency-brake the car swung around
slowly its rear wheels locked and then
headed down the slope it gained momen-
tum swiftly in another second it was
quite out of control

  i closed my eyes and groaned it was a
thousand feet to the floor of the valley
there were trees in the way boulders
banks of drifted snow and johnny holt
was in that hurtling juggernaut

  come on i heard the tub shout
fearfully hopelessly we started in pur-
suit of the sliding automobile which like
a great bob-sled was bounding down the
slope it had slid off the crown of the
hill now and was racing down the steep
ravine leaving behind it a cloud of flying
snowt and severed underbrush the ravine
curved slightly the car disappeared only
two deep tracks in the snow showed the
course of its swift flight

  the tub and i ran on down the hill
stumbling sliding gaining our feet falling
sliding again halfway down the moun-
tain we stumbled over the body of johnny
holt half buried in the snow cursing
softly but fluently we found the eel-
tenderly rubbing his left leg

  barked my shin when i jumped over
the door he told us climbing to his feet

  the tub threw his arms about the tall
form of our friend

  johnny we thought you were killed
aw dry up and get away from me
save that lovey-dovey stuff for your red-
haired mammas lets -get down the hill
and pick up the pieces thank the lord
the old man had the car insured other-
wise id be ruined lets go

  the three of us raced on down the hill
johnnys long legs carried him ahead of
the tub and me and he was soon lost to
sight around a turn in the canon when
we next saw him he was on the flat level
floor of the valley leaning weakly against
a tree rubbing trembling hands across his
forehead we ran to him anxiously

  whats the matter johnny i panted
heart go back on you altitude too
high

  no the eel murmured its my
eyes look do you see what i see
i followed his pointing arm and there
leaning nonchalantlyagainst a tree appar-
ently not fatally injured was the sturdy
belmont its top to be sure had been
left somewhere up the mountain two
fenders were hanging by the merest threads
of metal but the wheels the body the
radiator the running gear were still in-
tact and the motor was idling merrily
the eel stumbled forward again

  kept to the canon he murmured
dazedly no trees stayed right side up
all the way rear wheels locked kept
her from broaching sideways and rolling
over whod have thought it sitting
pretty a thousand bucks a thousand
bucks and three months in the wild and
untrammeled west hot damn

  a closer inspection failed to reveal any
further damage to the automobile than the
ruined top and fenders quite recovered
from his wild ride and his wilder leap from
the flying car the eel sat down on the
running-board wiped the perspiration from
his forehead drew out a pencil and a slip
of paper and began to write he glanced
up after a time listening from some-
where up the side of the mountain above
us came the deep roar of the speedwells
exhaust as the heavy car bucked its way
through the snow the eel grinned elat-
edly and handed the slip of paper to me

  telegram to the belmont agency in
san francisco he explained laconically

  i read it slowly with a sinking heart
knowing that it sentenced me to three
months of misery in the great open spaces

    in heroic struggle through snow and ice
   over impassable roads sturdy belmont driven
   by john holt battled its way over meyers
   grade first car of season to reach lake ta-
   hoe valley

  johnny rose grinning broadly

  the nearest town is meyers a mile
or two away likewise the nearest hotel
lets buy ourselves a square meal

for almost three months said bow
sheong i have been a prisoner in this
bed i have talked with no one but that
empty-headed doctor moo so tell me
lu chan what news do you hear from
your son ah toy

i hear nothing bow sheong declared
the woman angrily and let me tell you
before you speak your thoughts that i do
not want your money-i want my boy
it is true that when he was with me i was
starving but it was only hunger of the
stomach now when i have plenty of
rice and flour i cannot eat for now it is
my heart that is starving i do not know
whether the foreign-devil officials will not
let him write to his mother or if he has
been too busy since they took him to pris-


cchan bent over the dying man i
have come bow sheong she said in
quiet cantonese and i am sorry
for about as long as it takes to recite
the last prayer o-f the dying bow
sheong looked up at the womans pale
face and tired eyes

  so his deep voice rumbled brokenly
you-you say you are sorry well when
you hear what i have to tell you then-
then you will be glad that i am dying
lu chan drew back startled aih-
yah how can you say such a wicked
thing

  the old tong killer did not answer from
a teak stool at the head of his couch he
took a bowl of mui kwei lo anti drank
long and deeply of the fiery liquor
lu chan and the tongs

on i am only a woman and i know noth-
ing about such things

  that is true of course but the gossip
-the gossip of the shops-

  haie surely bow sheong you must
know that since my boy confessed to slay-
ing an old man for his money i have
walked my way with eyes that are only
for the shedding of tears with ears that
listen only for his step in the hall and
with lips that move only in prayer so i
have talked only with fong wo chee the
kind-hearted priest at the temple of the
seven gods he tells me that-that it is
all for the best that i must forget for-
get how can i forget when my heart
cries with every breath ah toy ah
toy 

  the old killer stirred uneasily hi low
that is true and that is one reason why
i sent for you i am going to tell you
how you can have ah toy set free i-

wffth a sharp intake of breath lu chan
bent forward her hands pressing
against her leaping heart she started to
speak but bow sheong interrupted angrily
for a moment then there was silence lu
chan trembling sat with closed eyes bow
sheong stared dreamily at the window as
though listening to the early morning
noises in the chinatown alley below

  now be still old woman bow sheong
said presently and let me talk for many
years as you know i have been a gunman
for the hoy sin wah tong i have slain
many men i have been very clever i
was never caught only once did i see
the terrible net of the foreign-devil police
closing about me that was when the
great tong war broke out in new york
city our tong received wire-talk to go
out and kill they sent for me at once
and that night-i killed ng gar lo
ng gar lo breathed the woman in-
credulously but-but they said-
that your son ah toy did it and
he confessed certainly that was how
i escaped our spies warned us that the
foreign-devil police were watching me that
they were asking many questions and that
they were weaving a steel net from which
i could not escape well i did escape
but i did it by having our tong pay your
son to take my place in the net

  lu chans mouth opened-and shut
there was a bewildered look in her eyes

  that night went on bow sheong we
smoked long over th matter at the meet-

by lemuel de bra



ing-rooms of our tong everyone said it
would be a bitter disgrace if i had to go
to prison but everyone said also that there
was only one way to save me the foreign-
devil officials were very angry over the
tong outbreak and there had been much
paper-talk

   so since some one had to go to prison
we decided to hire a man to take my place
i myself suggested your son you know
ah toy has never been worth anything
since he came back from the big war
he-

  was that his fault lu chan broke
in the waters of sorrow springing suddenly
to her eyes he was a bright boy until
they took him away across the sea they
kept him almost two years and they said
i should be very proud of it but what it
was all about i could never understand i
know only that when he came back his
eyes were like the eyes of a dead fish and
he could do nothing but sit and stare out
the window do you-

  hold your tongue growled bow she-
ong i sent for you to tell you some-
thing not to hear your chatter as i was
saying ah toy has been of no use to you
nor to himself since he came back from
the war he could not work and you
were not strong enough for both so i
sent for ah toy

  ah toy was slow to understand what
we wanted but once he understood he was
very sensible he agreed to our plan al-
so he saw the wisdom of not telling you
anything about it

  so your son who is innocent went to
prison that you might have the food and
clothing you need the money that the
tong has paid you every month and which
you thought was charity was earned by
ah toy when he took my place in the net
now do you understand

  lu chans sloe-black eyes were gleaming
with tears she nodded slowly

  i understand bow sheong but how
can i make them free ah toy i am a
woman they will pay no attention to me
i was coming to that yesterday the
doctor told me i have less than a month
to live that terrible disease that so many
of our men get from eating hot rice and
drinking scalding hot tea is gnawing at
my vitals i may live a month i may not
live to see another surv and i bow she-
ong the cleverest killer of all the tongs
who evaded death many times can hire no
one to take my place now
lu chan and the tongs



  so since i must die why should my
tong keep paying that money and why
should ah toy remain in prison let the
foreign-devil officials come and hear the
truth let them free ah toy and take me
to their prison-what does it matter to a
dying man

  lu chan jumped up what shall i
do she cried in a choking voice tell
me quickly

  go at once to the meeting-rooms of the
tong and fetch old moy ong the writer of
letters i shall explain to him exactly what
we wish to do and he can put everything
in writing then some one can fetch the
foreign-devil officials and i will swear to
the writing before themr

  unsteadily lu chan hastened to the
door she turned may the mother of
heaven bless you  she breathed fervently
and fled down the hall

  at the outer door of the rooms of the
hoy sin wah tong a flat-nosed chinese
with sullen eyes stopped lu chan

  what do you want old woman

  i want to speak with moy ong the
writer of letters

  he is not here

lu chans heart sank as she saw the
tong man start to close the door bow
sheong sent me she cried quickly it
is about ah toy and it is very important
but moy ong is not here i told you

it is too early come back in an hour

  i shall wait perhaps-

  you cannot wait here old woman
come back in an hour

  please-

  but the tong man closed the door

  in the street outside the tong headquar-
ters lu chan stood where she could watch
the stairway one hour-in one hour per-
haps sooner she would see moy ong and
they would start at once to set ah toy free
and ah toy knew nothing about it how
happy he would be if he knew

  lu chan looked down the street she
could see beyond portsmouth square the
cold-gray stone front of the hall of justice
that was where they took ah toy that
terrible day-lu chan could never forget
that he was not there now many
months ago they had taken him to the big
prison across the bay but she could never
forget that room where big men with loud
voices and rough hands shouted many ques-
tions in ah toys frightened face

  but there was one man in that room
who had spoken kindly to lu chan and

the blue

had offered her a chair he was a pale
man with white hair and he seemed to be
in charge of all the others perhaps he
could send word to ah toy that he was
soon to be set free

i u chan turned down the street-then
stopped it would take no more than
fifteen minutes to go to the police station
and get back but in that time moy ong
might come and go away again

  the woman was about to go back when
she saw a half-block down the street the
sugar-cane stand of gee hop gee hop
was puttering around the stand arranging
his cane for the days business lu chan
glanced back up the street to make sure
that moy ong was not coming then hur-
ried down the walk

  good morning gee hop will you
trust me for a sack of sugar-cane i have
no money with me

  gee hop stared at her as though he saw
a ghost

  it-it is for ah toy explained lu
chan quickly we are going to set him
free today arent you glad you always
liked ah toy even when he was just a
baby and used to steal your sugar-cane
suddenly gee hop jumped he filled
a sack with his best pieces pressed it into
the womans hand then turned away quick-
ly and pretended to be very busy

  many thanks murmured lu chan
by the way have you seen moy ong the
writer of letters this morning

  gee hop did not look around but he
waved a bony hand

  i saw him talking to nam jon the
dealer in drugs not five minutes ago if
you hurry-

  lu chan did not wait to hear the rest
nam jons place was just around the cor-
ner she hurried on to the druggists

  hoo la ma nam jon cried lu chan
is moy ong the writer of letters here
we are going to get ah toy out of prison
this morning and moy ong must help me
for a time nam jon stared at the wom-
an then he clicked his tongue and put-
ting the cap back on a jar of dried lizards
he set the jar back on the shelf he is
not here nam- jon spoke without look-
ing at the woman but i saw him not
five minutes ago talking with loy jing
the worker in gold and jade

  lu chan started on then hesitated loy
jings store was two blocks distant what
if moy ong should go to the tong head-
book magazine

quarters while she was seeking him on the
streets but perhaps he was doing some
writing that would take him all morning

  lu chan went back to the corner and
looked up and down the street there was
no one in front of the tong rooms moy
ong was nowhere in sight but still lu
chan hesitated and finally when she re-
solved to hasten to loy jings she noticed
that almost half of the hour had passed

  she found loy jing sitting at his desk
scolding his clerks because there were no
customers and polishing his gold-rimmed
glasses

  hoo la ma loy jing cried lu chan
i have good news for you we are going
to get ah toy out of prison this morning
is moy ong the writer of letters here
i must find moy ong quickly

  loy jings slender hand paused the
green silk handkerchief almost slipping from
his fingers in a dead silence he stared
at the woman

  did you hear me demanded lu chan
sharply i asked for-

  yes yes broke in loy jing and put
on his glasses hurriedly moy ong let
me think yes i saw him talking with
lai wo dart the pawnbroker not five
minutes ago if you hurry-

  the store of lai wo dart was in an
alley a block and a half from the head-
quarters of the hoy sin wah tong i
will go there said lu chan and if i do
not find moy ong i will hurry on to the
tong rooms and ask for him again

  lai wo dart was arguing with a round-
headed youth who wanted to borrow ten
dollars on an ivory elephant worth only
five dollars almost ten minutes passed
before lu chan got a chance to speak

  good morning lai wo dart ex-
claimed lu chan you know my boy
ah toy we are going to get him out
of prison today hate he may be home
in time for evening rice but i must find
moy ong the writer of letters is he
here

  through his huge shell-rimmed glasses
the pawnbroker stared at lu chan then
suddenly he snatched up the ivory elephant
and began cleaning it with a piece of jew-
elers cloth he has not been here old
woman lai wo dart said without look-
ing up why dont you ask for him at
the tong rooms

  i will do that said lu chan and hur-
ried away

  the door of the tong rooms was a mas-

by lemuel de bra



sive affair of solid oak when no one came
to answer the bell lu chan pounded on
the door panel and when that brought no
response she ventured to try the knob
the door was locked

  for twenty minutes lu chan waited in
the stairway but no one came

  what shall i do lu chan cried to
herself what shall i do if i go to
seek moy ong he may come if i wait
here he may spend the whole day else-
where and ah toy-

  on sudden impulse lu chan started
down the street as she passed the celes-
tial glory jewelry store she noticed that
she had waited for moy ong much longer
than an hour

  there were quite a few people in the
hall outside the office of the captain of de-
tectives but they paid no attention to the
chinese woman opening the door lu
chan was glad to find the pale-faced man
alone at his desk

  she mustered her best english

  i-you savvy ah toy

  the captain looked at lu chan a mo-
ment then said kindly do you mean the
young chap who went over for murder
that was too much for lu chan at
the look of blank helplessness on her face
the captain reached for his desk-phone
ten seconds later yick fang the dapper
sharp-faced chinese interpreter glided in
find out what this woman wants or-
dered the captain and turned to his desk

oh hello lu chan exclaimed the in-
terpreter as he turned to the woman
what are you doing here this morning
lu chan with a sigh of infinite relief
launched into her story

qaptain said yick fang later as he
got out a cigarette and with his
thumbnail struck a match alight i knew
just what you would say to the old woman
so i said it-i told her we would do every-
thing we could to help her-and sent her
on her way the chinese colony has kept
her in ignorance all this time which makes
the situation all the more amusing

  the captain looked up over his shoulder
what the devil are you talking about
he demanded

  yick fang chuckled

  bow sheong the tong killer has made
a confession that would free the old wom-
ans son ah toy but ah toy as you
know was hanged at san quentin about
an hour ago

tales of the mer-

hold you interested
to the last sentence

illustrated by frank hoban

it was at tea one afternoon in the draw-
ing-room of the governors wife at delhi
that a little group of four men-his
excellency among them-reached a decision
in regard to a certain commission for the
government then the group broke up
major carstairs of the staff being asked to
submit the matter to lady follansbee at
once and see if she cared to undertake it
he crossed to where she was sitting with
some other ladies just inside one of the
terrace windows-and when the other
women left them tete-a-tete broached the
subject to her

  weve considered three or four men for
this mission lady follansbee-but there is
obviously more risk in a mans undertaking
it than a woman particularly if he were
known to be in any way associated with the
indian government finally some one
mentioned to his excellency that you were
leaving almost immediately for a years stay
at home-visiting your children he tells
me who are at school in england and re-

cuperating from this beastly climate tne
fact that youve previously helped us out
upon occasion in a few instances would
appear to suggest you as the ideal person
to carry this out if you can do so without
inconveniencing yourself

  the inconvenience is not so much ma-
jor-though i presume you would wish to
alter my traveling arrangements somewhat
im booked on the p  o from bombay
you know but there is certainly more or
less personal risk about anything of this
sort-

  but-how could anybody suspect you
it is generally understood that some one
of the secret service will handle it 

  oh-how does anyone suspect things in
the orient the atmosphere is saturated
with intrigue then-again-suppose you
insist upon my shifting to some other boat
that sets tongues wagging it is com-
mented upon in the bazaars-who knows
by how many

  theres a simple explanation for that


the black star of narrapore



-one which should satisfy even the most
suspicious ones your physician considers
that a longer time at sea going home will
be much more beneficial for you-say one
of the half-and-half boats-a new cargo-
boat with fine but very limited passenger
accommodation and not over fifteen knots
at the most he thinks the social gayety
the incessant activity on a p  o liner
too much of a strain on your nerves
when what you most need is all the rest
and quiet you can get eh

  as far as that goes im feeling really
quite fit-considering this climate my
ayahs and all the rest of them know it too
still-one might be upon the verge of a
break-down of course but youre asking
me to accept a heavy responsibility-

  for which i fancy governmnt will
stand most liberal compensation if you
consent to undertake it i fancy you mag-
nify the risk a great deal-because the
master of the steamer will have private
governmnt orders to look after you care-
fully-though hell not know why an
two of the secret service will be in touch
until youre on board

  that would be a mistake no matter
how well disguised some of the hindus
might suspect their identity then if they
seem to be following me im either being
shadowed for some crime-or else entrusted
by the government with some commission
which renders guarding me advisable no

id best go down from here on my own
as if nobody had any interest in my move-
ments had you any particular boat in
mind

  until you asked-no but one just
occurs tome as being what you might pick
out from a news-sheet interest in her be-
cause of the ships recent adventures-book

age by the officers description of what hap-

  oh-h-h-you mean the argentine lib-

why-i fancy it might be an intresting
trip on such a boat aye but i couldnt
possibly make singapore in time to catch
her-shell be leaving there in two or three
days which means id have to go ashore
at aden and wait for her that ill cer-
tainly not do much too hot

jwfajor carstairs before getting
down to anything confidential with the
lady had taken the precaution of stepping
out through the window and looking down
the length of the terrace he was quite
positive that no human being had been near
enough to catch a word of what he had
been saying to her-and in this he was
right but rumor has many devious ways
of getting itself started lieutenant joe
cheddars for example who had been chat-
ting with two women at the other side
of the drawing-room was not in the gov-
ernors confidence nor that of the staff
but as one of the minor attaches he had
heard of course occasional bits of the in-
side talk which any man of intelligence
could put together very close to the mark
so he knew enough of the matter under
consideration to be quite sure that his
excellency and the staff men were prob-
ably discussing it at the moment he saw
all four of them covertly glance toward
where lady follansbee was sitting with
her two friends then he saw the nods
of agreement-saw the major casually
make his way down the room to her
watching them closely he could tell from
the facial expression that some request was
being made-and that the lady was finally
consenting

  by keeping close tab on carstairs during
the rest of that afternoon and the follow-
ing day he knew that the major was com-
municating with certain shipping agents in
delhi and singapore-then with other
agents in colombo if his surmises were
correct he worked out a line of probable
action very close to the truth and then
he spent two hours coding a message which
he cabled to a crony who happened to be in
singapore at the moment cheddars was
in an almost desperate position-heavily in
debt not knowing where to turn for sums
that he needed-in short in the sort of
mental condition where most men look
out for number one and become thor-
oughly unscrupulous

the army a short time before rather than

risk the chance of dismissal if some of his
activities became known by the merest
fluke nobody had suspected them up to this
time and his reputation was as good as
ever it had been in army circles-but hav -
ing thrown overboard personal honor in
his struggle to get clear of the entangle-
ments he also was now unscrupulous-
ready for any shady adventure which prom-

co much for the leak from lieutenant
cheddars intuition in another case
one of the hindu servants who was serving
tea in the drawing-room worked out an
almost identical hypothesis along the same
lines-and communicated with two of his
own caste in singapore all mind you
without anyone having actually overheard
a single word connecting lady follansbee
with the affair and this by way of
preliminary brings the threads of the story
together at singapore on the afternoon
when captain connyngsby put in with the
argentine liberator on his voyage to lon-
don to coal at tanjong pagar-to pick up
whatever passengers and more recent orders
his agents might have for him

  as coaling is a messy job at the best all
the passengers had gone ashore for a round
of the shops in the commercial quarter and
dinner at the raffles by the next evening
with bunkers full the boat was about to
pull out from the coal-pier when one of
the agents came hurrying aboard with a re-
quest that connyngsby anchor off the
p   wharf in keppel harbor until later
advices came in from liverpool there
was a prospect of picking up a small ship-
ment of tea at colombo which would fill
the number three hold and be worth put-
ting in for the shipment wasnt definitely
fixed but the agent expected advices next
day that it had been-and the captain
knew it was good business to wait for them

though he was by this time fed up with
delays and detours-would have much pre-
ferred going straight through without an-
other stop except for coal at port said

  as it proved he also picked up three
more passengers by waiting-two babus
who spoke better english than the average
and seemed to be men of means and a
tanned englishman of thirty-five or forty
who had about him the suggestion of army
training-the usual reserve of the britisher
who never speaks of his own affairs and
a superimposed ability to mix in anywhere
that made him rather liked from the start
he was on the list as c leffingwell gard-
ner had served during the german war
of course and was vaguely supposed to be
traveling for one of the oriental exporting
houses two young women also had been
added to the sajoon-list while the boat was
coaling-the misses weymouth and tor-
rance going home to visit relatives in eng-
land after three years with their parents
in the east of the former passengers
some of whom had been on the boat since
she left new york several months before
there were miss betty stevens traveling for
her health a mr fernshaw of london
mrs bently a wealthy and handsome
widow two hongkong merchants and a
married couple

  as the boat lay anchored out in the har-
bor next morning-most of the passengers
in their deck-chairs under the khaki awn-
ing of the boat-deck where they could
get all the breeze which happened to be
stirring-flo weymouth and amy tor-
rance were giving betty stevens bits of
the singapore gossip and amusing her with
their admiration for the boats officers

  what a perfectly ripping lot of men
you have on board miss stevens im
jolly well pleased we booked on this boat
instead of one of the liners of course
one rather expected that mr coffin would
be something out of the ordinry after the
things hes done but captain connyngs-
by is perfectly fine doctor thayer is
good enough lookin to attract any girl-
mr swain another of the same sort though
he cant possibly know as much-and mc-
tavish is a jolly old dear mr jennings
and mr fowler are much better bred than
officers youll find on boats of the northern
owners amy and i like them all-and
four arent married if youll tell us which
youve picked out for yourself miss stev-
ens well see if we cant get a little atten-
tion from the others-though mrs bentlyll

not make it too easy for us its hardly
fair you know she must be years older
than any of the four one fancies she
might rob a cradle if there were nothing
else in sight

  oh come now miss weymouth give
the lady her due she really isnt over
thirty shes pretty and shes clever with
money enough to make her independent
you wouldnt want the sort of man whod
be willing to live on a rich wife-would

whim of the moment it was not even certain
that he had found the wonderful stone in
india at all but eventually he had turned
up in the chandni chowk at delhi asking
the jewel-merchants if they or any of the
maharajahs whom they represented cared
to make a bid for the stone several of the

you no self-respecting man would do it
-and thats more of a handicap to mrs
bently than you might think and if shes
too old for these nice men i am too-be-
cause were not so far apart in age

here comes mr fernshaw youll like
him a lot even if he is married

  the introductions were casual-they
really were not needed on shipboard-
and fernshaw made his customary good
impression he was entirely at ease any-
where he found himself-in a moment or
two indeed he was asking the girls what
they knew of an occurrence which had been
filling the news-sheets in all of the oriental
ports-the finding of a great and appar-
ently flawless black diamond somewhere
in india by an english engineer who had
been traveling pretty much all over the
country with two pathan bearers it was
supposed that he had been prospecting for
mineral outcrop of various sorts because
he had a government permit for that sort
of thing but he seemed to have had no
connection with any syndicate and appar-
ently had been aimlessly wandering through
one province after another according to the

they attempted to bribe some
of the lascars and were
nearly stabbed

jewelers had measured and examined it
most carefully-the unanimous opinion be-
ing that no such black diamond ever had
been seen before in any part of the world
before there was any risk of murder or
theft the engineer had sealed it up in a box
and placed it in the up-to-date vaults of the
strongest bank in delhi by the merest
chance amy torrance whose father was in
the government service supplied additional
data which up to then hadnt gotten into
the newspapers

   it is known in official circles that hard-
ing the engineer was around the old
mines of raolconda and golconda-which
havent been worked for a hundred years
or more as i understand it the nizam
reserves the right to purchase at a nominal
valuation any great stone found in his prov-
ince this was told to harding by one of
the i s s men but he laughed at him-
said they would have to prove that the
stone came from hyderabad or in fact from
india at all

  aye-he had them there no black
diamond above a few carats ever has been
found outside of borneo thats not to
say however that none ever will be

  at all events they made nothing out
of harding with that sort of talk but one
the black star of narrapore

of the dealers in the chandni chowk who
represents his highness the maharajah of
narrapore had a conference with him in
which he pointed out that it would be very
difficult for harding alone to get the
stone as far as europe without having it
stolen and perhaps losing his life-that
when it was sold there possibly would be
litigation with various native princes in
india claiming the stone was found in their
own provinces-and that he would better
take a reasonable sum then and there
narrapore offered he said a couple of lakhs
for the stone-no questions asked all fur-
ther responsibility assumed by him after
considering this for a day or two harding
accepted the offer-got the two lakhs in
certified checks-had nothing further to do
with the diamond then narrapore offered
it as a gift to the british crown on condi-
tion that government would have it cut
in amsterdam to the largest brilliant ob-
tainable from the stone and call it the
black star of narrapore the home gov-
ernmnt accepted through the governor of
india who is sending it to england almost
immediately insured by lloyds-probably
through the special service of the royal
mails

  do you happen to know miss tor-
rance what the stone weighs in the rough

  as i recall it three hundred and fifteen
carats and nine sixty-fourths is the ac-
cepted weight at least half a dozen of the
chandni chowk dealers figured it very care-
fully

  femshaws lips puckered in a whistle

  gad i mean to see that thing at first
opportunity it must be absolutely unique
-superb did you hear anything about
its shape

  somewhat like a small potato they say
-very much like the cullinan before it
was cut though of course much smaller

  h-m-m-if there are no faults in the
cleavage such a stone might be cut to a
brilliant of around two hundred carats
but when they come to splitting along the
grain they may have to make two or three
smaller gems of it as was done with the
cullinan at all events theyll get one bril-
liant of somewhere between one hundred
fifty and two hundred-and an estimated
value of half a million sterling would
be merely tentative because there is noth-
ing like it in the whole world i couldnt
understand the inducement for narrapore
to present it to the crown at first but if
they name it after him he will get far more

the blue



personal advertising than if he kept an
wore it himself-not such a bad political
move either considering the conditions
throughout india

  what i dont see is why harding left
it go for any such sum as two lakhs two
hundred thousand rupees would be around
fourteen thousand pounds-or sixty-seven
thousand american dollars supposing he
got that stone as far as the bank of eng-
land vaults in london or some bank in
new york and it were not tied up by the
courts-which i consider a remote contin-
gency-he quite easily could have found
a purchaser who would have paid a hun-
dred thousand pounds for it-possibly
double that his taking the two lakhs is
a confession of weakness somewhere its
a tidy enough bit of money to pocket with
no questions asked and no come-back that
can implicate him in any way but every-
one who knows anything about the history
of precious stones would be practically con-
vinced that the thing never was found in
india

  that means borneo-with the restric-
tions which all of the malay sultans put
upon any jewels found in their states the
dutch governmnt itself wouldnt put for-
ward any claim but the sultans might
through the dutch courts if they got a
clue as to hardings wanderings-and when
the dutch courts start anything they usu-
ally go through with it harding is in a
vastly diffrent position from the mahara-
jah because hed go broke fighting any
sort of litigation-while narrapore with
millions in his bank accounts can sit back
and say prove where the black star
was found i know-you dont the
stone is mine and ill do what i please
with it the point which seems regret-
table is that after all his wanderings and
the constant risk he ran harding should
have to be satisfied with a trifling fourteen
thousand pounds

ceveral times during the first dinner
as the boat steamed up malacca strait
after leaving singapore captain connyngs-
by shot a puzzled glance at the passenger
who had booked as c leffingwell gardner
being rather keen at remembering faces he
was positive the man was really major
harry saltoun of the indian secret serv-
ice who had sailed with him upon two or
three former occasions and who had the
reputation of being able to spend days in
the bazaars as a hindu or pathan or

parsee without detection if saltoun were
detailed on special service it seemed almost
certain that he would have changed his ap-
pearance to some extent but merely to
book under another name when he was
likely to be recognized in any of the orien-
tal ports seemed an odd thing to do to say
the least he gave no indication of ever
having seen the captain before-which pre-
vented connyngsby from making the slight-
est advance lest he crab the other mans
game whatever it was but the thing
stuck in his mind

 the younger women on board had
started without delay a campaign of fem-
inine bedevilment against the attractive of-
ficers and were getting their full share of
attention even from the master himselt-
but in some of their councils of war-state-
room conferences-they were forced to ad-
mit that when betty stevens had some
reason of her own for wishing to monopolize
any particular man none of the other
women stood a ghost of a show-not even
mrs bently with her wealth and fascina-
tion it was finally concluded that this
was due more to miss stevens being almost
one of the ships crew because of her several
months on board since leaving new york
than to any superior quality of attraction
about herself-but in this belief they were
very far out betty stevens had gone
through some rather trying situations with
the argentine and her officers-who knew
her to be a dead game sport in any emer-
gency and had more solid admiration for
the girl herself than for any other woman
of their acquaintance she probably could
have married any unattached man on board
if he had the slightest idea that she would
consider it

  a ship at sea is a little world by itself
-which is why so many lifelong friendships
ripen in the few days or weeks of the voy-
age each new arrival at the ports of call
is studied for indications of his or her breed
and type before getting fairly up the gang-
plank-and is absorbed in a few hours
without a ripple at colombo lady fol-
lansbee was recognized as a personage be-
fore she and one of the ceylon government
officials got as far as the captain-though
she was booked without title merely as
mrs hortensia follansbee and appeared
to be traveling with a single maid who was
berthed in a separate stateroom the gov-
ernment man seemed to have come down to
see her off merely as an old personal friend
-he wasnt even in uniform-but when

there was nobody else within hearing he
told connyngsby that government expected
him to look after her ladyship very
closely-that because of her views upon
certain indian questions she had received a
number of threatening letters which fi-
nally had begun to get on her nerves until
her physician had sent her home to recu-
perate the official said it was scarcely
possible that any of her enemies could be
aboard the argentine liberator inasmuch
as nobody knew she was sailing until she
came aboard but there might be somebody
at aden or port said connyngsby who
had met her ladyship before assured him
that she would be taken care of-and when
he went ashore turned to her with a low
question

   its to be mrs follansbee-not aye

  er-quite so captain im delighted
to find you in command-we must have
some good long chats and if i drop a
hint you wont question it until afterward
will you theres a man farther along the
gangway who may take it upon himself to
presume a little-but i dont mean to
recognize him at all sorry hes aboard-
cant be helped i fancy

it must not be inferred that lady follans-
 bee was a bluestocking or the aggressive
club-woman type because she occasionally
read papers before womens societies and
had a gift for politics under the rose she
was unobtrusive good-looking a thorough-
bred from head to foot a woman sure of
herself in any circumstances it was a fair
sample of her intuition when she picked
betty stevens for her first steamer-friend-
ship on board the two were temperamen-
tally congenial

  snaith as c leffingwell gardner
didnt approach lady follansbee until he
had managed to hear her addressed with-
out her title and picked up a few little de-
tails which convinced him that cheddars
information was well-founded but after a
while he strolled along to where she and
betty stevens were chatting in their deck-
chairs removed his sun hat as betty intro-
duced them and smilingly remarked

   mrs follansbee and i have met before
i believe

   unfolding her lorgnette her ladyship
calmly looked him over before speaking

   that is quite possible mr--er-gard-
ner one is constantly meeting all sorts
of people everywhere ill not contradict
you of course-its a matter of no conse-
the black star of narrapore



qunce on shipboard -er-you were say-
ing miss stevens

  it could have been taken as a rebuff or
not as he pleased with miss stevens in-
troduction he could have remained stand-
ing there and would have been included in
their conversation more or less when he
seemed disposed to stay on that basis but
if lady follansbee had recognized the man
for the impostor he was studied out a re-
mark and manner that would puzzle him
the most concerning her she couldnt have
hit upon anything more effective snaith
was completely jarred from his self-posses-
sion and acted as if he had been caught
either in a brazen attempt to claim ac-
quaintance with no grounds whatever or
had received a most unjust and insulting
facer with merely a courteous bow he
strolled away to chat with some of the girls
who liked him

  from her ladyships point of view it
appeared self-evident that in spite of her
distinct objection to having any of the
i s s men accompany her as a matter of
extra precaution major carstairs had in-
sisted upon sending one after all-though
by getting him aboard at singapore he
probably thought it impossible for anybody
to associate the man with the mission she
had undertaken but she had lived in the
east long enough to know that she had
been absolutely right in refusing an of-
ficial guard that the presence of such an
official on board easily might bring suspi-
cion upon herself at some unexpected mo-
ment had it not been for one vague
doubt in her mind she would have sent a
radio to carstairs that she would place the
matter in major saltouns hands at once
and leave the boat at port said-she was
that provoked this doubt was a some-
thing about the masquerading gardner
which didnt ring quite true if saltoun
really were on special service which had no
connection with her affair he was suffi-
ciently clever in his character-impersona-
tions to fool anybody who knew him well
without altering his facial appearance it
easily might be that-in which case her
annoyance at carstairs was unfounded on
the other hand if the man actually was
traveling under his own name and merely
bore a close resemblance to the i s s of-
ficer she didnt see how he could suspect
her own mission his claiming former ac-
quaintance with her might have been done
in perfect good faith by some man who had
been introduced with a crowd of others

by stephen hopkins orcutt

but she could recall nobody who so closely
resembled saltoun and finally decided that
he must be on detached service for the
indian government and had taken that
means of warning her not to address him
by his own name in that case he could
have asked for nothing better than her
manner toward him they had been intro-
duced as strangers and could be courteous
to each other as shipmates without implying
previous acquaintance in any way

rto betty stevens however the incident
was sufficiently odd to arouse a specu-
lative interest in her mind lady follans-
bee had given every indication of being
considerate to everyone so that her action
was surprising if she had no grounds for it
but the supposed mr gardner had given
a favorable impression from the moment
he came aboard it seemed impossible that
he would chance any such rebuff unless he
supposed that she would recognize him as
a former acquaintance so after a moment
or two betty asked

  whats wrong about mr gardner
weve quite liked him since he came aboard
at singapore

  i think i may tell you something in
confidence miss stevens-because youve
sense enough to see the trouble you might
be making if you blabbed mr gardner
is really major somebody else of the
i s s i fancy he claimed acquaintance as
he did merely as a warning that i must not
address him by his own name-which would
imply that hes on detached service of some
sort he is somehow vaguely diffrent from
the man i know in his little mannerisms-
but hes so frightfully good at all sorts of
characterizations that he may have been
trying to make me do just what i did-
fail to recognize him if hes not the gov-
ernmnt man then i cant recall any occa-
sion upon which we ever met because the
resemblance is so close that i certainly
would have spoken of it at the time

  h-m-m-that accounts for something in
the captains manner ive caught an oc-
casional glance at gardner-whom he must
think he knew on some other boat though
the man doesnt seem to know connyngs-
by

  as for the supposed gardner he was
completely up in the air until hed had a
chance to reason out something approxi-
mately close to the real situation as char-
lie snaith of the -th rifles he had met
lady follansbee upon several occasions and
gardner was on his feet in
stantly are you hurt

knew that she was even better acquainted
with major saltoun but with his black
mustache and in uniform the resemblance
between them was scarcely noticeable in
this impersonation of the major he knew
beyond question that she must suppose him
to be the i s s man-indeed he had been
addressed as saltoun on the streets in sing-
apore before coming aboard he could
vaguely understand that she might suppose
him to be on detached service and think it
suited his book to consider him a stranger
-but again she could hardly do that after
he had claimed previous acquaintance if
she were engaged by the governor to carry
out the mission cheddars had seemed so
positive about it seemed to him that she
must welcome having assistance close at
hand in case of emergency her whole
manner seemed to indicate that cheddars
somehow had been mistaken and had led
him on a fruitless chase but-cheddars
needed money too urgently to make a mis-
take of that sort conceivably he must
have known what he was talking about if
he was right snaiths impersonation of
saltoun didnt seem to be getting him any-
where if she took him for saltoun there
was a strong inference either that she didnt
trust him-hardly a supposable theory-
that she was not carrying out any govern-
ment mission or that if so she was de-
termined to play a lone hand and take no-
body into her confidence he didnt know
what to think but he was playing a lone
hand himself-and it presently seemed to
him that her attitude might be turned to
his advantage as for connyngsby-
snaith of course had no knowledge of any
former acquaintance between him and the
major so had no idea that the captain
considered him a government officer

  like snaith the two babus didnt con-



  sider it possible that such information
  as had come to them could have been ob-
  tained by anyone else in singapore in time
  to book on the argentine they had no
  suspicion that he might be in the game it
  never occurred to him that they had sailed
  with the same object each was concen-
  trating only upon lady follansbee and
  each was fully as much in doubt about
  their information having been correct or-
  dinarily the babus would have had the ad-
  vantage over any european from their skill
  in hypnotism and ability completely to
  disappear when one had been speaking to
  them a second before-but the ceylon of-
  ficials hint to connyngsby had just about
  spiked any effort they could make the
  captain had understood that she was being
  threatened by orientals hence his first
  orders in her case had been to swain chief
  steward and acting purser to have his
  stewards maintain the closest possible
  watch upon the two babus as they were
  the only orientals on the boat at the time
  except the lascars of their own crew who
  were known to be intensely loyal the re-
  sult was that they had no opportunity for
  getting anywhere near her or her stateroom
  -one of the stewards invariably turning up
  with some perfectly courteous message
  which prevented even a word with her it
  afterward came out that they had at-
  tempted to bribe some of the lascars and
  were nearly stabbed for their pains after
  that the lascars helped the stewards in
  keeping track of them-but neither of
  course made the slightest attempt to inter-
  fere with snaiths movements or consider
the black star of narrapore

them suspicious it had gotten about the
ship in the way nobody ever satisfactorily
explains that he belonged to the raj-
which gave him pretty much carte blanche
had he known to what extent this went
he might have been more careless than he
was

vye have now in hand all of the different
threads leading up to what occurred
on the second night out from colombo
lady follansbee was too clever to invite
comment by cutting the supposed mr
gardner after he had been introduced to
her-particularly when she saw that he
was popular so she permitted the usual
steamer-acquaintance with him finding the
man an interesting conversationalist as of
course she had known from previous oc-
casions ashore after dinner on this par-
ticular night-one of the loveliest she ever
had seen on the sea of arabia-she had
gone up to her deck-chair with the other
passengers and gardner had dropped into
one next her while he finished his cigar
there was enough of a roll so that the chairs
would have shifted now and then had it
not been for the marline which lashed
them to the rail and as always in a bit
of a sea the usual noises creakings rum-
blings of the boat herself as a subdued un-
dertone presently during a more pro-
nounced list to starboard lady follansbee
stopped what she was saying with a slight
exclamation of pain gardner was on his
feet instantly with extended hand

  er-beg pardon-but-are you hurt

  its nothing i fancy just a bit of a
stab in my thigh-possibly a nail or a
splinter from my chair

  if youll permit me wed best examine
the chair and find out which a rusty
nail you know calls for antiseptic at
once

  he helped her out of the chair and ran
his fingers along the edge of the wood-
hard maple and in the deep shadow cast
by one of the power-launches swinging from
its heavy davits in a few seconds he held
up a sharp splinter in the moonlight-hav-
ing loosened it with his pocket-knife when
everyone was below at dinner

  fancy it must have been this mrs fol-
lansbee i can feel no trace of a nail
most of the fastenings on these deck-chairs
are screws you know the end is quite
sharp as you see-hardwood

  oh it was that undoubtedly    
thanks a lot lets see-where were we

the blue



  continuing the chat for another few
minutes she presently got out of her chair
again-said she was going below to her
stateroom

  fancy i must have eaten too much at
dinner-that pudding was unusually good
when i overindulge i get sleepy no-
dont bother please im a good sailor
good night

  in thinking it over next day it seemed to
her that by the time she reached her
stateroom she was so sleepy she could
scarcely keep her eyes open-it was an
effort to strip off her clothes get into pa-
jamas and tumble into her berth as her
maid would be along presently she didnt
lock the door for it was her habit to
wake instinctively at the slightest unusual
sound according to the maids account
she opened the door not over ten minutes
later-she was accustomed to putting the
room in order for the night before her
mistress appeared then wait to brush and
braid her hair but finding the lady so
sound asleep that no question wakened her
she braided the hair as best she could-
straightened the clothes and the room and
then went out supposing that lady fol-
lansbee would wake from her nap in a little
while and bolt the door as usual

  before the bugle sounded for breakfast
a much frightened maid ran below to
swain in the pursers office and told him
she feared her mistress was dead-lying
against the door going up with her at
once after sending a steward along for
doctor thayer he found the door unlocked
but held by what he feared was her lady-
ships body pushing it back with the
door as gently as he could he squeezed in-
side and lifted her upon the berth-find-
ing to his amazement that she was fully
conscious but gagged and bound prompt-
ly releasing her he and the maid were
bathing face and neck with cold water when
thayer came in the doctor found in a
few moments that she was apparently little
the worse for her experience and thought
her quite able to come below for breakfast
when she rather weakly suggested it

  my room has been completely over-
hauled as you see doctor-everything
turned inside-out-steamer-trunk pulled
from under the berth ransacked and then
shoved back again ive no idea what has
been taken and ill not bother with it until
after breakfast when i find out ill have
a talk with the captain of course-but
meanwhile you and mr swain will please

avoid mentioning this to anybody mary
not blab-shes been with me too long
now run along please and let me dress
my word how that gag made my jaws
ache thank you both-so much

puring breakfast there was one man
 in the saloon who casually glanced at
lady follansbee and addressed an occa-
sional remark to her as usual-he was very
much on his guard to do this in exactly
the manner he had used before and not to
betray that he was more than ordinarily
interested in her appearance at the mo-
ment but an uneasy feeling almost fear
of something unexpected seeped through
him as he noted that she seemed none the
worse for her nights experience and gave
no evidence of being worried about any-
thing better than anyone else on board
he knew that she should be fairly sick with
worry and the unconcerned manner in
which she chatted and ate her breakfast
with apparently good appetite made him
wonder if by any possibility he could have
been recognized by a seemingly uncon-
scious woman after breakfast she went
in a leisurely way up to the captains cabin
-shutting the door when he would have
left it open

  captain-something occurred last night
which makes it necessary to ask for your
assistance at once youve read the news-
sheets accounts of the wonderful black
diamond known as the black star of narra-
pore in fact i heard you discussing it
with some of the ladies it was accepted
from the maharajah by the governor of
india on behalf of the crown-and the
sending of any great jewel such a distance
is always a serious matter involving some
risk a few have been sent through the
registered mails without mishap-but this
stone is unique the governors first de-
cision was to send it by two of the i s s
men traveling as merchants or tourists but
there was the risk of their being spotted

i had successfully carried out missions for
the government upon former occasions and
it was thought that i would be less likely
to be suspected than any man would be-
so i was entrusted with the stone which
ive been carrying in a chamois pouch
strapped next to my skin in a position
where it wouldnt be noticeable through
my clothes last night i fancy i must
have been drugged in some way my room
was turned upside-down-and evidently i
was handled rather unscrupulously while

unconscious the stone is gone nobody
knows of this except my maid mr swain
doctor thayer-and yourself i suppose
you may feel it necessry to enlist the
services of two or three of your officers in
trying to recover the diamond-but i
fancy youd best limit the knowledge to as
few as possible of course on a boat of
this size one might conceal such a thing
where it wouldnt be found for years but
at least you can prevent anybody from
going ashore without a thorough search of
person and luggage there was some talk
of your stopping for passengers at aden
but i understand that was left optional with
you to some extent-you can easily find a
reason for not doing it that would give
us from now until we coal at port said
if we dont find it by then it might be
tossed ashore through one of the ports
when were tied up at the coal-wharves
now-what -do you suggest

ronnyngsby was for a moment very
much upset-realizing the unpleasant
notoriety resulting from anything of the
sort on his boat even though no responsi-
bility could attach to him or his officers
for a second or two indeed he wondered
if he were quite sure as to that reach-
ing into a drawer of his desk for an excep-
tionally good cigar he lighted it-puffed
for a minute before answering

  id say i fancy that wed best put the
very best brains weve got aboard on this
job-have a conference up here where we
may question you upon points which you
may not have considered important seems
to me well get ahead faster much more
certainly by sitting down an thinking this
matter out than attempting to ransack the
whole ship what

  my idea precisely captain ive
heard it said that youve a good head-
and im sure of it now who do you sug-
gest

  ned coffin-whom youll know from
the press accounts is a top-side man in the
mate line doctor thayer swain mc-
tavish wholl be able to spot anything
suspicious in the engine-room an stoke-
hold gangs-an i fancy we may get valu-
able assistance from miss stevens shes
by way of being personal secretary to one
of the big american railway magnates ac-
customed to handling all sorts of problems
-an she thinks a good bit faster than i
do been on this boat so long that shes
almost one of us so has fernshaw-whos

the blue

a confidential agent for lloyds an vitally
interested in this particular stone inasmuch
as theyve insured it for a staggering price
id rather bring him into the matter at
some later time if we are unsuccessful
miss stevens and the others i approve
without reservation-but i fancy that will
be enough to find the stone if its to be
done in a quiet way and we may rely upon
their being close-mouthed

  one by one watching their chance to
slip up the port ladder to the bridge unob-
served and then along to connyngsbys
cabin the others dropped in-after which
the door was locked ned coffins first
question was as to whether lady follansbee
suspected any one person

  no i looked about my room very care-
fully for any little object which might have
been dropped-for noticeable finger-marks
-but i couldnt find a clue of any sort
i must have been in a very heavy sleep
from the time i tumbled into my berth
until sometime after sunrise when i found
myself gagged and bound-tried to get up
-and fell against the door theres no
doubt that i was drugged have you any
lascars malays or hindus in the galley
mr swain

  not one french scotch and irish
have you any stewards who might
conceivably attempt anything like this
fancy not some of our stewards were
bribed in a case of attempted piracy on the
way up from batavia to manila-but we
got rid of every one and overhauled the
new ones very thoroughly before taking
them on-looked up the references of each
man our lascars forard have been tested
a dozen times-an unusually fine picked lot
in fact id say rather positively that one
of the passengers got the stone

  coffin nodded emphatically-he felt
pretty certain as to the thief

  my idea exactly tommy and youll
find the two babus have the stone they
may be in the pay of some maharajah or
acting on their own but any oriental could
dispose of that diamond for a higher price
than a white man with no questions asked
such a stone would be what theyre always
looking for to stick on the number one
idol in some temple-

  well-thats true enough but those
two babus have been watched more closely
than anyone else from the moment they
stepped aboard on the chance that they
might have some intention of murdering
her ladyship the tip from that govern-

mnt chap at colombo led us to suspect
something of the sort-though of course we
know now that the object was a diffrent
one entirely well those two hindus were
playing chess in the smoke-room an drink-
ing their everlawsting sherbets from the
time lady follansbee went below until the
lights were turned off they went directly
to their room taking the chess-board with
them-kept their light burning until four-
bells in the morning and smoke coming
through the blind from two until six the
night-shift of the saloon stewards didnt see
either one come out-though i fancy they
might have climbed out of their window
without being seen one of the lascars
was on watch along that gangway but he
might have gone forard for a couple of
minutes id say therell be scarcely a
chance of their bein mixed up in this

c wains data was disappointing to most
of them because they had jumped to
the conclusion that the only oriental pas-
sengers on board were most probably the
thieves and fully half stuck to that belief
but an idea occurred to the captain

  i say weve an i s s man aboard
you know-though ive respected his in-
cognito on the chance that hes on special
service seems to me we should bring him
into this-hed have a lot of native data
that would never occur to us what
there were two immediate protests

  no i object to that very strongly
captain this from mrs follansbee

  i think it might prove a serious mis-
take captain said betty stevens youre
referring of course to mr gardner we
all like him more or less-he seems to be
as straight as a string and yet theres some-
thing about him which has been puzzling
me for the last two days i dont know a
thing against the man but hes about the
last one id bring into this

  whats your ladyships objection
im reasonably sure as you are that
gardner is really major saltoun-but at
times im by no means positive

  hmph it just occurs to me that
therell be a way of testing that saltoun
was in the war of course-struck by shell-
fragment at second ypres-inside of right
leg above the knee-never healed properly
if anything whacks him in just that spot
hes almost crazy with pain for a moment
or two well-ill stumble against him be-
fore long an manage to whack it then
well know-positively
book magazine

by stephen hopkins orcutt



  hes not claiming to be saltoun on
board if you find hes not you prove
nothing more than a case of strong resem-
blance-nothing in the least against the
man who may not even know of it
your ladyship says that you were un-
questionably drugged-because you never
slept like that before now-unless its
some particular dish youve asked for
something the chef knows you particularly
like nobody in the galley would know who

evidently i was handled
rather unscrupulously while

personage like the sultan of bungi-trelak
her ladyship has the corresponding one
on the starboard side replied swain

  could the bath be used by mr gardner
-from his room

  if he wished to pay four bob a day

was getting any one dish or cup of coffee
your saloon-steward is the captains man
bobbs-been on the line seven years with
a top-side record ill swear he didnt drug
you or would even accept any special dish
from the galley without mentioning it if
drugged it must have been somewhere else
can you think of any circumstnce when
such a thing might have happened

  not unless a splinter from a maple
deck-chair would put me into such a sleep
as that mr gardner and i were chatting
on the boat-deck when i shifted about in
my chair and ran the splinter into my
thigh he helped me up then found the
thing-broke it off and showed it to me
dare say it may be down there in the scup-
pers yet-

  when was this

  ten or fifteen minutes before i went
below last night

 a soundless whistle puckered miss
stevens lips she casually asked

  who has the comer room forard-next
to mr gardners

  vacant that and its adjoining bath
form one of the two de-luxe staterooms-
usually reserved for owners friends or some

more for it the bath communicates with
both staterooms through doors which may
be bolted on either side of course if
gardner had been using the bath it would
have been reported by his room-steward-
but hes not saves his money by havin
a regular hour in one of the public baths
betty changed the subject as if it no
longer interested her

   it seems to me well get on faster from
here if we try to figure it out by deduction
doctor youve been on the boat long
enough to know the whole crew pretty well
and youll admit that whoever figured out
the plan to steal the diamond as it was
stolen must have a more clever brain than
the average person-not well can you
think of any lascar stoker greaser or
steward whose brains are in that class
doctor thayer shook his head

   i cant think of a single one-and ive
talked with or prescribed for all of them
the black star of narrapore	the blue



the lascars are more or less psychic like i could recover it within an hour or so

all orientals intuition cultivated to a sur-
prising degree but they lack the initiative
to do things on their own the stokers
are mostly animals or they wouldnt take
that sort of a job greasers a notch or
two more intelligent-they have to be if
they keep fingers and limbs from being
crushed by machinery in motion stewards
-well you occasionally meet one with a
first-class head but he doesnt ship as
steward more than one or two voyages
ours are of average intelligence but they
lack both the nerve and the initiative to
figure out anything like this and get away
with it

  then as lady follansbee was the only
passenger who came aboard at colombo
and as there was no thought of sending the
stone by her until two days before we left
singapore that would seem to eliminate
everybody on board except the two babus
gardner flo weymouth and amy tor-
rance who came aboard there on fairly
strong circumstantial evidence theres no
other conclusion to be reached than that
-is there

  h-m-m-now that youve put it in that
clean-cut way miss betty i think id agree
with you on any logical basis the rest of
us must take the same view and id point
out that if you eliminate all of the crew
upon the ground of insufficient brains you
must leave out the two girls as well-not
nice attractive girls good company read
the popular novels and some of the gazettes
-but most certainly not with the sort of
brains this calls for

  all right i wont push this to a snap
conclusion just now-overconfidence makes
as many mistakes as ignorance lets ge
another slant assuming that you person-
ally have brains enough for this-and i
guess nobody here will dispute that-what
would be your probable course if your plan
worked out successfully and youd actually
gotten the stone into your possession
what you figure on as the safest disposition
you could make of it-at once

  that requires a little thought you see
up to this time ive never stolen a jewel of
that size i would know instinctively that
i and my baggage would be searched
sooner or later-every cranny of my state-
room also id try to think of a place
where it could be safely concealed until the
boat was entering the thames if necessary
-some place where it wouldnt occur to
anyone else to look for it and yet where

might even leave it until the boat sailed
on her next voyage and then book on her
no matter which way she was going
precisely nine men out of ten would
follow that line of reasoning after getting
the stone well our problem is to find
that place within the next seven days be-
fore we reach port said it looks to me as
if thats all there is to it

  connyngsby grinned-then the troubled
look came back into his face

  hmph that all will take some doing
miss betty-on a boat of this size
not if we do it with our heads captain
-instead of trying to find the needle in the
haystack with our hands and feet the
man who did find it dug down into the hay
with a flash-light at just the one spot where
it was lost you know-he wasted no time
on the rest of the stack

vvhen the conference broke up miss
 stevens went below with the mate and
thayer to coffins room on the main-deck
where she closed the door-and then asked
them who stole the diamond ned coffin
with a gesture of impatience said the
two babus of course betty smiled at
him in a slightly maternal way

  neddie boy-youve done so many big
things on this boat that ive been expect-
ing you to blow up and show a streak of
poor judgment somewhere now if you
werent frightfully upset over the probable
effect of this on the boat and all of you
when it gets out you wouldnt be so apt
to jump at conclusions-youd use your
bean to better advantage what do you
say doctor

  gardner without much question he
jabbed a hypodermic into her ladyships
thigh in the deep shadow behind that
launch-and didnj even have to pick the
lock of her door he figured that shed be
too far gone to get out of her berth after
mary left the room

  after that splinter story its pretty
nearly a cinch isnt it all right now
lets go up and get that stone while the
gettings good one of you pass the word
to lady follansbee and the captain to
keep gardner on the boat-deck aft for a
good hour and a half if possible then get
a big screw-driver a small one a good-
sized gimlet-and a pocket flash-light-
wrapped up in a parcel so that nobody
will know what youre carrying one by
one well sneak into that big forard room
book magazine	by stephen hopkins orcutt



when nobody is looking one of you get
the key from tommy and tell him to keep
mum come along now no telling how
long it may take us

  the walls of the officers rooms on the
main-deck were simply the ships plating
covered with two coats of white enamel
but the passengers staterooms on the boat-
deck were sheathed in yellow pine as far
as the ceiling and painted with the same
enamel so that between the cushioned
transoms and the outer plating of the deck-
house there was a space with a depth of
four inches providing a pocket for the
windows and their blinds

  when they were in the room bettys
first action was to go down on her knees
with the flash-light and closely examine the
wooden sheathing under the lower berth
and under the transom opposite in a mo-
ment or two she reached up for the little
screw-driver and commenced scraping at
the cracks where one of the yellow pine
strips joined the others on either side-for
the light showed that it had been sawed
through close to the deck and the under
side of the transom in the third strip
from it she also noticed the point of a
wood-screw which had been driven in from
the space back of it loosening and prying
out the strip with the big screw-driver she
reached her arm through the opening and
felt around for the head of that screw as
she expected her fingers touched a steel
wire suspended from a round screw-eye-
and hanging from that wire was a tightly
wrapped package which she pulled out in
it they found the chamois pouch with its
straps and a malevolently sparkling chunk
which gleamed and flashed in the sunlight
that came through the forward port

  they were so fascinated with the won-
derful thing that they wasted precious time
examining it until betty realized this and
set to work putting back the strip under
the transom and filling the cracks with
bread-crumbs as she had found it lock-
ing and bolting the bathroom door on
gardners side they managed to leave the
room without being seen then went below
to the pursers office where after seeing
what they had tommy swain immediately
sent for lady follansbee when she joined
them he suggested her doing up the stone
in a waterproof package and sealing it with
her ring-then permitting him to place it
in the boats strong-room just under where
he was standing assuring her it was the
latest thing in steel safety-vaults installed

upon any ship this she consented to do

  i considered it when i came aboard but
there is the risk of collision at sea running
foul of a derelict and foundering-in which
case thered be no time to get it if we
were on deep-water it would be lost for-
ever you know but i fear i must take
that chance now by the way the cap-
tain accidentally knocked gardners leg
with a camp-stool-and apologized gard-
ner merely grinned-said he scarcely
noticed it but that merely proves hes not
saltoun-which he never has claimed

  hmph ill prove a darned sight more
than that in a few days i guess just
wait until he wants tommy swain to shift
him into that corner room

ualfway up the red sea after having
found the steward had locked him
out of the bath and corner room as he
supposed-gardner made this request upon
the ground that it was better ventilated and
that he wasnt feeling quite fit he made
no demur over the extra price for that
room but didnt care to pay for the bath
-which was then locked against the cor-
ner room and the first hour that he spent
in his new quarters he was closely watched
by five people through the bathroom bulk-
head by means of tiny gimlet-holes as
miss stevens had foreseen one of his first
acts was to get down and pry out that strip
under the transom he was cursing when
he stood up again

  connyngsby had all the evidence he
needed to put the man in the brig for the
remainder of the voyage and turn him over
to the london authorities but there seemed
nothing to be gained by it if gardner
brazened it out the case against him
wasnt any too good-supposing for ex-
ample that he swore hed been merely
groping under the transom for a miss-
ing cuff-button gimlet-holes are pretty
small the fellow was punished enough
in his disappointment over losing the stone
after actually having it in his possession--
but the main consideration was the advis-
ability of suppressing all evidence that the
diamond was or had been on the boat at
any time

  at tilbury a launch with two kings
messengers and several secret service men
from the foreign office took lady follans-
bee off while her maid went in a car to the
savoy with the luggage-and they didnt
leave her until the black star of narrapore
was safely in the bank of england vaults

 gary

the story so far

  as body-guard to a prominent person-
 age back east he had earned the
i v name of go-getter gary and
when slow recovery from a bullet-wound
sent him to the west to recuperate he all
too soon found exercise for his peculiar
talents as expert pistol-shot for he stum-
bled first thing into a lively little cattle-
war and the way of it was this

  a chance acquaintance had told him he
could find employment with one vance
austell owner of the hat-on ranch but 
his first meeting with austell was unfor-
tunate leaving the train at a little new
mexican town he looked about for some
one who could direct him saw no one and
made his way to a tumble-down store
and there in the back room he came upon
austell and a young ranchman jack royd
in a violent quarrel austell had encour-
aged royd to drink heavily and had won all
his money-and his ranch to boot-at
poker and entering the store behind gary
came a fellow-traveler from the train-
royds sister connie

  garys quick wit and the presence of
the girl saved that situation then dep-
uty-sheriff lobo leet a henchman of aus-



jack yelled warningly and as
lobo leet popped an eye past
the corner of the wall gary let
drive with both guns

tell allowed gary to attempt making his
way on foot over the long desert miles
to the ranch he was picked up exhausted
by the royds and left at austells ranch
but found scant hospitality there the
hat-on cowboys gave him an outlaw horse
to ride and he barely escaped with his
life austell hired him finally-as a gun-
man to aid him in his quarrel with the
royds but as soon as opportunity of-
fered gary left austells place and sought
out the royds he found they had dis-
charged their few employees and were about
to acknowledge austells poker-claim to
their property by abandoning it he per-
suaded them however to stay and fight
and himself enlisted under their banner as
gunman extraordinary and at large

  at the round-up which followed shortly
thereafter further ill-feeling developed
bitterness between austell the royds and
tonto drake the third rival cattle-owner
in the region grew apace and gary
found himself the object of suspicion on all
sides austell tried to force gary to carry
out his bargain to shoot jack royd fail-
ing in this he succeeded in discrediting
gary with the royds through his hench-

man the deputy-sheriff lobo leet-who
appeared at the round-up with a telegram
purporting to come from chicago and
identifying gary as a murderer with a
reward on his head leet endeavored to
provoke gary to draw his weapon in order
that he might have justification before
witnesses for killing him but gary sub-
mitted to being handcuffed only when he
came to realize that leet intended to copy
the notorious mexican ley juega-shoot
his prisoner on the journey to town and
report him killed while attempting to es-
cape-did gary act then with his hand-
cuffed hands he snatched royds pistol
crippled leet and made his escape evad-
ing attempts to shoot him from ambush
on the way to town he found temporary
refuge with the decrepit old caretaker at
the ranch of tonto drake the story
continues in detail

the west-end round-up was a larger and
more difficult operation than that of
the east by the time drake and his riders
came trailing to his ranch ahead of the
outfits chuck-wagon gary felt and looked
like a new man though his chest had not



go-getter gary

yet fully healed he had regained almost
all his strength

  drake showed no surprise over seeing
him at the ranch the hat-on cook had
dropped a hint to the tonto hasher that
the dude gunman had out-foxed his dry-
gulchers by hitting the tonto trail

  when i seen four-five his men was
gone concluded the cow-man i tried to
put it on austell hed sent em to get you
taint any too easy roping a slicker like
him he tells royd and his
sister he let his extra hands
go owing to royd getting his
own bunch back he says
twas none his business if his
laid-off riders went to take
the killer-meaning you-to
get that thousand reward
he says he tol em to take
you alive even though you
tried to murder the deputy-
sheriff

  gary fixed upon the only
angle of this that interested
him miss royd could not
have believed him

  well i aint saying she
did and i aint saying she
didnt hes a smooth liar
hes got even royd most
ready to feed out of his hand agin sames
he uster the gals a right smart little
cuss she aint so easy soft-sawdered all
the same shes waiting only for him to
prove he didnt cut out that broncs tongue
did he asked gary

  drake spat and answered tersely
bronc threw him onto a cholla-bit his
arm crazy hawse ought a been shot
was given the walking death draw yore
own conclusions who done it

  the cow-man spat again and changed
the subject bill says yuh got the mak-
ings care to go on the pay-roll

  not till i can do enough to be worth
wages gary replied he looked down at
his shapely new high-heeled boots bill
said you always ordered them too tight
and you wouldnt mind my breaking them
in for you

  keep em kid theyre youm taint
safe to ride with that boot lobo shot the
heel offm youd get hung up and drug
if yore bronc throwed you

   this even more than bills friendliness
convinced gary that he was beginning
to belong he knew it would take a long
while for him to become a competent roper

and rider but it meant a great deal that
tonto drake considered him good enough
to hire

  what rounded out the situation for
gary the tonto punchers were neither
hostile toward him like the hat-on gang
nor were they overpolite and offish as had
been the box r riders they ignored alike
his gats and his dudeness and in-
itiated him into the order of cowboys with
rough practical jokes

  as gary took even water-filled boots with
a smile the horseplay soon stopped the
tontos were an oldish lot slow and quiet
in their talk gary surmised that they
would be more dangerous in a fight than
any of austells hand-picked swaggering
gunmen

  he had several days in which to make the
acquaintance of the outfit and fit himself
to become one of its members crude and
hard as were the conditions at the tonto
he had no wish to leave he even began
to speculate whether he might not be able
to buy into a partnership with drake the
bonds that he had been salting away for
years could be sold above par but would
the old cow-man wish to share his iron
with a partner if he regarded it as a
personal possession rather than a business
he might be touchy over any proposal

  gary started to feel his way by seem-
ingly casual remarks to bill and the other
men what he learned from them rather
inclined him to believe that their grim
boss would not welcome any offer to buy
in with him at any rate it was a matter
that called for discretion

vvhile gary was still hesitating over
 his next move the ranch had a visi-
tor gary had helped bill cut and haul a
wagonload of rails from the nearest growth
of trees to mend the corrals on their re-
turn gary called bills attention to a
strange horse between the adobe buildings

  sorter looks like one of lobos broncs
kid bill commented dryly

  gary put his hands down he now
packed his gats in holster pockets sewn
on the front of his old chaps he was not
yet accustomed to the change from the
pockets of his discarded coat

  but the man who came from the bunk-
house with drake did not carry one arm
in a sling nor was he tall and stringy
garys life had all too often depended upon
his instant recognition of faces one glance
at the big fattish visitor was enough

  he had the advantage of the sheriff in
his cowboy rig and with his one-time white
sickly face altered by sunburn and over-
flowing vitality he was so changed that
sutton did not know him until he spoke

  howdy sheriff are you looking for
me

  lord whod a thought it boomed
the visitor with loud heartiness he of-
fered a fat hand youre looking tip-top
nobodyd take you for a lunger now
gary quirked his lips how about tak-
ing me for a killer

  uh-that- hesitated the sheriff
drakes rusty-iron face was more morose
than before as he cut in grimly

  i tol sut its up to you kid no need
you going if you dont want to fact is
it kind of looks like i can use you in yore
own line

  aw hold on tont remonstrated sut-
ton in his bluff tone of good-natured
friendliness you agreed to let me talk
to him

  shoot grunted the cow-man

  muchas gracias always knew you
were on the square tont the sheriff
fixed his rather fishy eyes upon gary
heres the how of it boy lobo got
what was coming to him he had no busi-
ness hazing you after you surrendered
hes a minus deputy

  you mean that youve taken away his
star-that hes no longer an officer
just that the fool put me in a bad
hole ive got to apologize for what he
done same time im sheriff thought
id come and talk it over with you ive
got a hunch the charge against you is a
frame-up you was so gentlemanly offer-
ing to go in with lobo it struck me you
might help me out by coming in to clear
yourself no questions of cuffs or frisk-
ing

  i see bantered gary you wouldnt
mind my helping you collect that thou-
sand-dollar reward

  sutton looked a bit sheepish what
dyou say we split it

  that goes agreed gary he turned
to his scowling boss half the reward
will more than pay my expenses mr
drake i want to clear my name when
i come back ill bring along a roll to buy
an iron or an interest in one

  ugh grunted drake if you go
you stay gone

  with that he turned his back on gary
and waddled around the wagon to rumble

an order to old bill the sheriff was shav-
ing a plug of tobacco to fill his pipe gary
shifted around to look past him at drake

  never dreamed hed dislike so to have
me leave

  sutton bent close for a confidential ex-
planation

  its not you thats riled him boy
ysee when lobo reported and i fired him
hed last seen you with the box r outfit
knowing royd was a hot-headed fool i
waited all this time after the round-up to

after you winged lobo

  sure boy only howd i know it
figured they had you hid out on me

sutton heaved a ponderous sigh uh-ah

if only i wasnt a sheriff sos i could a
kept my mouth shut

  yes gary questioned

  the sheriff took off his hat to mop his
bald head with a silk handkerchief

  if you want to know i aim to be a
peace officer but im always running
plumb into trouble circling west of
royds headquarters i stumbled onto a
fence cross a little box canon up the
canon was a bunch of cows and calves
the calves was all fresh branded with the
box r

  well

  sutton jammed on his hat

   taint well a-tall its plain hell them
cows was all tontos

  what you mean that jack royd-
no i dont mean nothing all im
doing is just stating the actual facts like
i done to tonto there was also a bunch
of tonto hawses in the canon you savvy
now whats got him on the peck

  gary did not reply he thought that
the sheriff was lying yet how could he be
sure bill had told all too many tales of
the liberality of cow-men in helping them-
selves to each others stock according to
the old buckaroo more than one cattle-
king had built up his first herd with cows
that did not belong to him

  for all gary knew connies brother was
merely following an old cow-country
custom the only crime about which was
to be found out but in this case his
rustling had been discovered-unless sut-
ton lied one look at drakes morose face

by robert ames bennet

  was enough to show that the old gun-
fighter did not consider the rustling of his
stock any joke

  the first thought that occurred to gary
was to slip away on his pinto and warn
jack sober second thought smothered the
impulse he had saved jack from austells
gun that first morning in lobo leets
store he had prevented connies brother
from giving up his ranch and cows to the
card-cheat he had backed him against the
whole hat-on gang as his only reward
jack had tied the can on him

  true connie had saved his life but
her brother had shared only grudgingly in
the rescue he was sullen even with his
sister and austell had claimed he did not
treat her right not improbably she might
be better off without such a brother

  at any rate gary felt that he was not
called upon to interfere the box r
wanted nothing to do with him even
connie had given him his walking-papers
besides if jack had not rustled drakes
calves or horses he could no doubt prove
his innocence on the other hand if he
really was guilty he deserved punishment
all the more for having brought the shadow
of crime upon such a sister as connie

  drake had started off with bill gary
muttered a query that bobbed up out of
his seething thoughts will he come in
with us to swear out a warrant against
royd

  tell you better tomorrow replied the
sheriff

  he lit his pipe and led his horse into
the corral gary went to bring in his
pinto ready for a dawn start when he
came back everyone was at supper
drakes mood appeared to have lightened
he even joked gruffly with sheriff sutton

  in the bunk-house the punchers passed
up their usual nightly card-game and took
to their bunks early gary was glad to
follow suit he had swung an ax most of
the day and was dog tired he slept like
a log

at the dawn breakfast drakes chair
and the bench places of the four top
riders were vacant a careful ignoring of
this fact on the part of the other men kept
gary from asking questions

sutton showed such uneasiness to get
started that gary humored his haste sun-
rise found them on the trail the sheriff
set off at a brisk trot the farther they
went the more his uneasiness seemed to
go-getter gary	by robert ames bennet



increase he soon put his bronco into a
lope

  all of this like the absence of drake and
the four top riders from the breakfast-
table puzzled gary but he kept his eyes
open and his mouth shut sutton had
made no attempt to search or handcuff
him

lvyille after mile they covered the twists
and turns dips and rises of the desert
trail as the sun climbed up from the east-
ern horizon the pace set by sutton was
so rapid that mid-morning found them far
along toward the fork in the road

  at sight of the distant marker butte the
sheriff for the first time came to a halt
he threw out his hand and turned to look
at gary with a show of vast concern on
his heavy face

  i wont stand for it he burst out
tonto backed me last election and royd
didnt all the same that dont let me out
i got to try to do my duty

  im coming right along with you
promised gary

   taint you disclaimed sutton lord
if i hadnt no more to worry me no
its royd didnt you catch on tonto
has gone after royd not a word to me
about swearing out a warrant you must
savvy what that means

  i see hell take jack himself

  sutton flung out his fat hand take
him youre sure a greenhorn hes gone
to get him

  no

  what else the oozing sweat on the
sheriffs face was now unmistakable i
made a slip telling him where i found
that fenced canon hell check me up on
them calves and hawses and then-aint
you ever heard of vigilanting rustlers
the raised hand made a loop around the
fat red neck and jerked upward

  it cant be protested gary you
must have courts and law out here now-
adays its been twenty years since mr
drakes last fight hell only bring jack
in for trial

  who-tonto drake when hell have
trees and a rope handy even if jack
tried to put up a fight hell have no more
chance than hed have against you or
lobo

  gary had been talking against his own
belief that the old gun-fighter was quite
capable of lynching or shooting anyone who
rustled his stock the situation looked

  black for jack royd but sutton was
sheriff why all this talk instead of ac-
tion

  maybe its not too late sheriff if
drake has to hunt up that canon perhaps
we can make the ranch ahead of him

   we  queried sutton

  yes ill go along with you

  the blank look on suttons face was fol-
lowed by a broad smile of relief

  say boy say aint it true i sized you
up for a gentleman minute i set eyes on
you only trouble royd is sore at me
for going out there he let on it was ow-
ing to his friendliness for you but we savvy
now it was that rustling of his anyway
he threatened to shoot if i ever came back
fact is hes had a grouch against me since
last year when he got soused and tried to
shoot up the town

  what of it youre sheriff

  but what good would it do the young
bullhead if we had to shoot him in order
to take him might as well leave him to
tonto no by jakes ive got it youve
played square with me boy im betting
the charge against you is a frame-up

  it is said gary

  sure all right then heres the lay-
out youre a friend of royds least-
ways i heard that miss connie saved you
from dying of thirst youll want to pay
her back by getting her brother a fair trial
for what hes done the fool would sure
pop loose at me but like as not hell come
along peaceful if you tackle him alone
im not an officer

  this set the sheriff to fumbling in his
pocket he fished out a badge

  heres lobos star i hereby deputize
you to go and bring in jack royd on the
charge of rustling stock

  gary paused to consider im not think-
ing of jack trouble is im already in bad
with miss connie shell not thank me
for arresting her brother

  you dont savvy boy its just what
she will do soons she knows tonto is after
him shell want him to have his chance
with a jury you can figure what chance
he has with tonto drake this old bronc
i hired off the station-agent is a give-out
hawse youre straddling the best thorough-
bred in the country if any hawse can
hell get you to the box r before tonto
gary plucked the deputy-sheriff badge
out of suttons fat fingers and jumped the
pinto into a gallop on a cross-slant for the
box r trail
        chapter xix

at the tonto ranch gary had learned
something of the limit that should be
put upon an overwilling horse he held
the pinto down to ten miles an hour that
was enough to bring him in sight of the
box r ranch nearly half an hour before
noon

  his first look down into the green little
valley was directed in anxious search for
tonto drake and his waddies sight of
men quietly at work on the new upper crib
of the dam took the saw-edge off his dread
it showed him that his roundabout run
over the open desert had beaten drakes
cut across the bad lands of the west-end
winter range

  yet any moment the old-time gun-fighter
might come racing to revenge himself for
the stealing of his stock by connies
brother gary called upon the pino for a
final spurt

  as they neared the dam he saw there
were only three workers jack and two of
his punchers were nowhere in sight that
looked bad if sutton had not lied jack
might have gone to do something with the
stolen stock or perhaps to rustle another
bunch in either case drake probably
would catch him with the goods no
chance then to save the fool

  the dam-builders had stopped work to
stare at the hasty visitor to the box r
one of them picked up a rifle but gary
paid no heed to the half-raised weapon

he had no time to waste if jack was
away connie must at once be warned of
the clanger to her brother she might know
how to reach him in time

  with no more than a wave of his hand
to the threatening men gary raced past
them straight for the ranch buildings be-
hind him he heard three roaring reports of
the rifle but no bullets cracked past
him the shots had been fired only as a
signal

  before he had passed half the length of
the water-hole he saw jack and a puncher
step from the open gateway of the horse-
breaking corral another puncher followed
them on horseback then connie came
hastening from the ranch-house with pete
a dose second

  this accounted for every member of the
box r outfit none was off rustling or
riding herd on rustled stock yet sheriff
sutton looked far too shrewd to be a
bungling fool he would not have sent on a
wild-goose chase a submissive prisoner who
was to bring him at least half a thousand-
dollar reward he must have had a solid
basis for his accusation against jack very
probably he really had seen that bunch of
rustled stock

  just possibly one or more of the box r
punchers had done the rustling without
the knowledge of their boss however that
might be tonto drake would need only
to see the stolen calves and horses with his
own eyes he would then act first and ask
questions afterward according to bill
this was the regular old-time vigilante pro-
cedure so the first matter to attend to


go-getter gary

was not the question of jacks guilt or in-
nocence but his safety at any moment
drake and his grizzled old gun-fighters
might come swooping down into the valley

  connie reached her brothers side just
as gary reined the pinto tq a halt close
before him and his pair of frowning
punchers like them jack had recognized
the caller at a distance and like them he
looked none too well pleased even con-
nies greeting held no friendly note of wel-
come it was both protesting and con-
cerned

  gary you here i asked you to go
away-and stay

that hit gary so hard he would have
liked to turn around and ride off with-
out a word but he had come to save
her brother not his own feelings there
was no time to waste in talk he tossed
the reins over the pintos head and swung
down to draw open the left side of his
coat

  jack stared at the deputy-sheriff badge
pinned to garys shirt front

  good lord he muttered youve
finished lobo stolen his star

  no sheriff sutton discharged him
he sent me out here to bring you in-on
the charge of rustling

  the look of amazement on jacks face
might have been only good acting gary
had all too often seen guilty men look in-
nocent and innocent ones look guilty it
was hard to judge by appearances but
the indignant scorn in connies voice was
unmistakable

  for shame how dare you call my
brother a-a thief

  her scorn cut gary like a whiplash
yet he managed to give no sign of how it
stung him he answered her quietly

  i havent called him anything the
sheriff deputized me to bring him in on
that charge

  jacks sullen temper flared youve
sold out to vance suttons his man
theyve sent you here to get me

  he turned to connie with shame re-
doubling the heat of his anger and i was
fool enough to let vance bunco me again
-slick me into helping him soft-sawder
you

  gary need only have kept his mouth
shut austell would have fried in his own
grease the man was bad it would be
a crime to let him win connie but a
silent lie was none the less a lie straight

the blue



talking was as necessary as straight shoot-
ing he made the correction

  youve scored a double miss royd
the sheriff sent me to take you not to get
you and he did it on his own play
aw bah sutton has no more sand
than a fishworm

  sure thats why he deputized me but
it was all his move-not austells

  you dont say where dyou figure
he got the gall to plaster me with this
lying charge of rustling if vance didnt
put him up to it then its on you-its
your come-back for my firing you
though taken by surprise by this
counter-charge which looked to him like a
clever attempt to throw up a smoke-screen
gary kept cod it never paid to get
ruffled

  no he replied its all suttons play
when he came here after me he thought
you were hiding me out on him after he
left-so he alleges-he circle-rode and
found a bunch of corraled stock the
calves had your brand on them but the
horses and cows were all tontos

  this time jack looked both amazed and
furious tontos its a bald-faced lie
yes soothed gaiy easy enough
then for you to prove it to a jury sooner
we start the better sutton went and
spilled over to drake

 what when

  he streaked straight to the tonto this
morning i found that drake had left in
the night with his four best shots i was
going in with sutton so he could collect
the reward against me but he got cold
feet over drakes coming to lynch you
lets be moving i ran my horse to get
you away before drake could find his
rustled stock and hurry here to pay you
for it

  youre a damned liar shouted jack
its a dirty frame-up youve sold out
to vance

  garys friendliness curdled his quiet
coolness froze

  hard words break no bones royd but
weve had enough talk im acting as the
sheriffs deputy get on that horse and
come along

  jacks response was to shuck his gun
the play had been expected by gary he
took the big automatic from its owner as
he had taken wys old six-shooter as he
sprang clear he covered the pair of willing
but slow-drawing punchers

  thats it friends-hands off the hilts
book magazine

sit tight now royd im going to get
you away from here one jump ahead of
drake if i have to make your men tie
you on the horse

  oh no no cried connie you-its
not true jack couldnt have done it if
youre honest youll stay here with him and
make tonto listen to the truth

  he would listen-at your brothers
funeral replied gary anyway im dep-
utized to take in the accused how about
it royd do you go with me or do i
take you tied

  jack raised his clenched fist its all
a hellish frame-up

  you- gary shoved the pistol muzzle
at the two punchers tie him on that
horse or ill wing you

  hold on jack interposed youve no
call to shoot em up ill go with you
gary at once lowered the pistol as
jack turned to take the horse from the dis-
mounting puncher connie gave a quick
order to the other man

  fetch jack my roan lin im going
along on this horse they shant get jack
off all alone

  thats fine miss royd gary agreed
before jack could speak why not have
all your riders come along too

  the suggestion plainly took her aback
she looked puzzled-perplexed then no
doubt she decided there was some artful
catch about his willingness the man lin
was already hot-footing into the corral
she turned to his mate

  call in the other boys all of you ride
out and look for tonto and his bunch if
you find them bring them after us if
you dont find them by mid-afternoon hit
our trail hard pete youll stay here in
case the boys miss tonto and he comes in
ahead of them if he does send him after
us

p ary saw jacks face darken the young
cow-man did not seem as eager as his
sister to meet-up with tonto drake
but he said nothing as if to cover any
betrayal of his thoughts he bent over and
began to unbuckle the sheath that held
the rifle on lins saddle gary interposed

  let it stay royd i dont care to load
down my horse

  connie for the first time fixed her at-
tention upon the pinto he looked far
from used-up but her practised eye saw
how hard he had been ridden she stroked
him from forelock to lip

by robert ames bennet



  a roll would do him good she said
coolly as she spoke gary jumped to
carry out the suggestion he had the lat-
igo strap loose from the rings and the sad-
dle off as quickly as jack himself could
have done it the pinto promptly went
down in the dust he rolled three times
while gary unfolded and shook the sweat-
dampened saddle blanket

  the moment the horse lunged to his
feet gary rubbed the dust off his back and
resaddled him connie had mounted lins
horse jack sullenly swung up on the big
roan bronco led from the corral by lin
pete had sprinted to the house he streaked
back to fling a pair of saddlebags over the
horn of connies saddle and hand her and
jack each a canteen

  the punchers from the dam came hasten-
ing to saddle up they passed gary with
none too friendly looks he kept his eye
on them as he made a sign for jack to
start off ahead of him connie rode for-
ward beside her brother and had him turn
down to the edge of the water-hole

  she called back to gary in that same
cool tone your horse needs water but
let him have only half a drink

  given the reins by gary the pinto
floundered out knee-deep and plunged his
dusty muzzle into the water gary pulled
his head up when he saw connie and jack
spur their broncos away from the edge of
the reservoir

  he would have started the pinto off at
a gallop any moment now he expected to
see drake and his men come racing to
head them off or to hear the crack of their
rifles but all his urgings failed to make
jack and connie quicken their broncos out
of a slow trot

  to his vast relief he saw no sign of any
tonto man even when he followed his
leisurely leaders up over the rise above the
valley a backward look showed the box
r punchers streaking out from the ranch
in five different directions but of the
tonto riders no trace was to be seen any-
where around the little valley or ahead
along the trail

  jack flung back a jeer over his shoulder
lost strayed or stolen one bunch of
vigilantes

  dont crow till youre out of the
woods gary replied

  connie cast a startled glance back at
him then peered off to the west and
quickened the pace to a lope gary began
to breathe a bit easier but he did not
go-getter gary

feel fully relieved until after miles of steady
loping they at last reached the mesa cleft
and made the descent without running in-
to any ambush

  once down upon the lower desert he felt
almost certain they must have put drake
ahd his bunch behind them that would
mean safety the broncos ridden by jack
and connie were fresh the pinto may
have traveled a few miles farther than the
tonto horses but their going had been
across very rough country he could still
outrun the best of them

  when a brief stop was made at the first
slough to let the horses wet their nostrils
in the shallow little puddle of the drying-
up hole gary could not help expressing
his relief that he had brought jack safe
away before drake could strike the fact
won him no word of thanks nor look of
gratitude even from connie

  her brother was more than ever sarcas-
tic still trying to string us with that
bull con are you ill give you ten to one
odds old tonto hasnt stirred off his home
range

  id be glad to make the bet if i felt
sure id lose said gary

  four-flush sneered jack whats
the use of lying youve got me come
clean its all a frame-up even a fellow
like you cant have gall enough to stick
to such a lie

  gary turned to connie only to see the
same certainty of his double-dealing in her
coldly reproachful eyes what was the
use of mere denials they had made up
their minds not to believe him

  think what you like he said your
sheriff deputized me to take you talk
all you want but make no breaks im
going to bring you in

  dead or alive jack got in another
jab of the gaff

  yes gary looked around at the back
trail well so far youve done your best
to make it dead

  the fairness of connies nature com-
pelled her to concede the truth of this
claim

  thats so jack youve done enough
to have given a deputy like lobo leet ex-
cuse to shoot you-twice over

  which proves this city killer hasnt the
nerve

  quite right agreed gary also i
lack the nerve to loaf here with tonto
drake likely as not on our trail push
along pronto

by robert ames bennet



  connie possessed plenty of determina-
tion but none of her brothers bull-headed
obstinacy she could at least consider the
possibility of being mistaken

  wait she said if its really true
tonto went to lynch jack might he not
have suspected this interference by mr
sutton and sent men to block the trail near
the forks

  the shrewdness of the suggestion added
not a little to garys high estimate of the
girls intelligence

  youre right miss royd old bill
told me that in the tonto basin war drake
never lost a trick he outfoxed everyone
till they bunched together and bought him
out wed better side-step the forks aus-
tells bunch would have got me at the
butte or east of it only i swung off to the
tonto

  another gibe from jack was forestalled
by connie you cant mean to claim that
vance austell tried to dry-gulch you it
was only his discharged riders attempting
to take you for the reward

  gary showed the second set of bullet
holes in his hat

  have it your own way only whether
they were operating for him or for them-
selves they seemed to prefer collecting the
reward on my corpse but thats neither
here nor there the point now is that i
dont want trouble with austell yet i
cant let your brother chance a meeting
with drakes men if you say so well cut
straight for the hat-on

  i savvy put in jack youve sold out
to vance and his man sutton is having
you steer me into their noose but con-
nies coming along has got you guessing
what to do

  what a mind-reader youd make said
gary suppose i leave it to your sister
to choose which way to head the only
condition is that well not turn back i
undertook to deliver you to the sheriff
and i will do just that

  once more connie interposed well
try to sift through midway between the
buttes lets go

chapter xx

a few miles more of the slow but steady
loping brought the three up a long rise
in the desert connie halted her horse
just below the crest and dismounted jack
swung off beside her to the southeast
and southwest gary saw distant pine trees
above the skyline of the rise they were
the tree-tops on the butte beside the trail
and the one at the hat-on ranch the
buttes appeared to be about the same dis-
tance away

 jack and connie were drinking from
their canteens jack started to wet the
nostrils of their broncos gary followed
suit with the pinto when he turned
around connie was taking food from her
saddlebags she offered him a slice of
the boiled ham and a chunk of the cake
that pete had flung into the bags

  the bitterness that had ridden with
gary rose into his mouth he felt that
ihe mere taste of box r food would choke
him no thank you miss royd im
not hungry

  dont be silly she replied theres
more here than jack and i can eat

  then give it to your broncos they
are not slick sneaky city gunmen

  the shot hit connie flushed scarlet
tears gushed into her eyes

  say growled jack what the heck-
he scowled at gary if youve got fresh
with her throw your guns and be damned
im going to bust you wide open

 no-no jack connie clutched his
arm dont its my fault

   its not denied gary you have the
right to look down on me im exactly
what you labeled me-a professional gun-
man

  then you own up to it put in jack
youre a killer

  that does not follow theres more
than one kind of gunman

  the look in connies eyes cleared and
she managed an uncertain smile

  wont you please join us mr owen
put that way gary could not refuse the
invitation as he took the food from her
their fingers touched he felt his face
flame hot with mortification at his clumsi-
ness her face also flushed deeply no
doubt he had angered her again

  but he sat down on his heels cowboy
fashion to force himself to eat as con-
nie also sat down she spoke in an oddly
gay tone

  you see its as well to give the horses
a few minutes rest if tonto is waiting to
head us off we may have a run for our
money do you think you can stay on
gary pulled a long face if i dont
i hereby name you as my posse to take
over the custody of my prisoner and deliver
him to sheriff sutton

  the absurdity of this drew a grin from
jack but connie took it seriously ill
deliver him mr owen the best way to
meet a false charge is to face it squarely
and prove it a lie

  yes miss royd thats why im go-
ing back to chicago youve had no letters
about me

  why no we havent been in for mail
since i came home what was it
go-getter gary



the blue

  ive been waiting for-but well let that
ride i know now it would make no differ-
ence you two will get off at the county
seat ill go straight on through

  the remark gave jack an opening for a
jab glad to hear youve at last decided
to go straight

  how about yourself asked gary
this rustling charge may be a frame-up
as you claim but youve owned up that
youve been a gambling fool in spite of the
fact that you have a sister worth crawling
on your knees to be good to

  it was jacks turn to flush he muttered
rather lamely well anyhow i-nobody
ever heard me brag of stacking a poker-
deck

  oh jack remonstrated connie to
drag that up when he did it all for you

t-jer brother flung away what was left

	 of his cake and rose to catch his graz-
ing horse he was rounding the crest of
the rise before the sprinting bronco and
pinto overtook his spurred roan

  keep to the left called connie hold
down in the draw

  aw forget it her brother shouted
back that tonto dope is all bunk

  he held on straight over the bald crest
of the desert swell gary following close
after connie caught a tiny flash or glitter
on the brink of the trail-butte rimrock

  whats that light on the butte he
asked

  even as he spoke the glittering point
blinked on and off again other quick
flashes followed

oh cried connie its some one on
the butte he must have seen us with
field-glasses hes signaling with a mirror 
jack turned in his saddle to scowl at
gary

  that clinches it you tricked me away
from my men to steer me into this trap
as gary sprinted the pinto past con-
nies horse he kept his gaze on the butte
crest he could not face the scorn he felt
sure was blazing at him from the girls
eyes he held out jacks forty-five auto-
matic to him

  here you are royd and get the rifle
from miss connie if i get thrown or cant
keep up with you drop the rifle ill try
to hold them back

  like hell you will jack whirled the
pistol around with its big muzzle toward
gary line out try to drop behind
and youll get plugged

  no use arguing with a stubborn bone-
head a touch of garys heels sent the
pinto striding into the lead he kept it
until connie spurred her bronco up along-
side him the rifle boot was empty the
girls gaze was searching the desert ahead
and to the right

  she did not look at gary

  follow me she directed watch out
for side-jumps and gullies

  gary pulled the overwilling pinto just
enough to fall in behind the bronco
he did not look back to see if jack still
had him covered all his attention was
needed to keep himself in the saddle con-
nie appeared to be in quite a bit of a hurry
the pace she set was not a sprint but it
was faster than any except the best of
horses could hold up under for a long-
distance race

  though gary had ridden faster it had
been only on fairly smooth ground the
desert between the two buttes offered as
he remembered not much choice of route
none of it was very rough and none very
level connie must have known the fact
she headed for the railroad on a beeline
midway of the buttes

  the girl swerved out of the straight
course only to round the ends of the higher
rock combs or to cross arroyos where the
banks were climbable all the small gullies
she took on the jump luckily for gary
he had learned at the tonto ranch how to
stick on a leaping horse as well as a crow-
hopper he now had only to balance him-
self forward and back the pinto did the
rest

  more than a mile of dust spurted be-
hind the swift-pounding hoofs of the horses
before a fairly level stretch let gary ven-
ture to look away from the ground close
ahead the thud of hoofs back of him
suddenly stopped he glanced over his
shoulder jack had jumped from the roan
and was swinging up his rifle

  gary jerked his gaze around to the di-
rection the rifle was pointing half a
mile off to the right front a horseman was
racing across from the direction of the
trail he evidently intended to cut in ahead
of the fugitives and hold them from be-
hind one of the rocky ridges

  at jacks second shot the horse pitched
headlong flinging his rider ahead of him
if the man moved he did so under cover
of the greasewood bushes into which he
had been hurled

  another crack of the rifle shifted garys

gaze to a second horseman who had raced
up over a rise a quarter-mile farther to the
right neither horse nor rider fell but
they swung off westward and dipped out of
sight

  connie veered her course a little to the
left all the ground ahead was rougher
it forced the hard-running horses down to
a lope though the line between the two
buttes had now been crossed gary saw
the girl continue to cast anxious glances
off toward the trail yet a long two miles
of slow going were covered with no further
sign of enemies

  the broken ground smoothed out on a
wide grass-flat gary drew a deep breath
it looked as if they had already distanced
even the rider turned by jacks last shot
neither the pinto nor either of the broncos
showed signs of giving out and here was
easy going

p arys relief was short-lived just after
connie jumped the lope into a gallop
a flock of bullets kicked up the dust be-
tween gary and jack and behind jack
a moment later other bullets struck ahead
of gary the dry-gulchers were fast get-
ting the range a bullet glanced from the
steel shank of garys saddlehorn he heard
jacks horse snort and plunge then
abruptly the shooting stopped

  connie had whirled her bronco in a short
circle that brought him alongside the pinto
her brothers horse scorched across the
rump by a bullet had sprinted forward to
pass the pinto on the left side connie was
racing along in line between them and the
hidden dry-gulchers

  every bullet had carried a message that
the killers were close enough to distinguish
between the three fugitives not one of
all the shots had been aimed at connie
her quick-witted maneuver proved the fact
and balked the killers they could not
shoot at either jack or gary without dan-
ger of hitting her no more bullets snapped
their whiplash crack across the flat desert

  but the thought of shielding himself be-
hind a girl was more than gary could
stand he dug his heels into the pintos
flanks just as jack was forging out ahead
but with the pintos leap to top speed con-
nies bronco also jumped into a sprint the
three horses raced for nearly a quarter of
a mile with jack and gary never more
than a length apart and connie very slow-
ly falling to the rear

  at last connie cried out for an easing of

the mad rush slow down-slow down
my horse is beginning to blow

  gary did not obey until he had streaked
ahead far enough to be well clear of both
his companions but the bullets he ex-
pected failed to arrive he did not even
hear any shots a glance over his shoulder
told him the reason

  four horsemen were slanting across from
the rocky ridge behind whose crest the
shots had been fired connie though sev-
eral lengths to the rear had swung out to
the right that kept her still too close in
line with jack and gary for the galloping
pursuers to risk any shots

  farther back beyond long rifle range
appeared the moving dots of two more pur-
suers in line with the trail butte quite
near to the right and a little ahead the
hat of still another rider kept rising into
view and sinking out of sight this sev-
enth man probably was the one who had
swerved off when jack dropped the horse
of the gangs foremost rider

  the cautious stalker was racing behind
a low land-swell in an attempt to head the
fugitives he was already within close
enough range to have jumped off his horse
and shot both jack and gary before con-
nie could have come up between but he
lacked either heart or head for the venture

  jack must have had his eye on the
skulker his chance came within the next
mile the low ridge or swell flattened
down jack began to fire across at the
exposed rider holding his rifle butt at his
left shoulder this together with the fact
that his horse was tearing along at full
gallop made the shooting doubly awkward
his very first shots however must have
come uncomfortably close to their mark
the rider suddenly shunted off to the west

  bueno shouted jack hey owen
ease down weve got em strung out

  as gary obeyed the command connie
once more took the lead but her brother
still held his position behind gary his
belief that gary had drawn him into the
ambush evidently had not lessened

  gary now had time to think twice of the
accusation and he realized that from
jacks point of view the charge must ap-
pear to be well based he had been stay-
ing with tonto drake bill had given
many instances to prove that his boss was
as foxy as he was ruthless might not
drake and sutton have connived the
scheme to send the eastern gunman for
jack in case of a lynching that would let
go-getter gary

out the sheriff at the same time it would
win him the backing of drake by giving
drake the chance to vigilante jack off
away from his outfit

  in any event whatever were the facts
behind this attack it must already have
succeeded had not connie come along with
her brother so far she had saved him
and gary also but the railroad was still
at least twelve miles away

chapter xxi

dy the time the off-sheering rider on the
flank found shelter behind which he
could race forward again he was too far
off on the side and rear to give connie
any further concern small danger now
of his being able to get into the lead

  the girl had already gauged the speed
of the foremost pursuers she set a pace
only just fast enough to keep them from
gaining this was what gary had done
when running before his two pursuers on
the trail to the tonto for connie to do
the same thing seemed to him to show
that he had guessed at good horsemanship
as well as good strategy

  before the long and grueling chase had
covered half the remaining distance to the
railroad the two leading pursuers were well
in advance of their fellows they began
to gain on the fugitives whenever the going
became rough at such places connie had
to slacken the pace the fresher horses
of the pursuers took the ridges and arroyos
with slight check

  at last starting up a higher ridge con-
nies bronco slowed to a walk he was
blowing hard as gary and jack drew
rein alongside her connie made a desper-
ate gesture for them to ride on

  dont stop your rifle jack hurry
-hurry keep going ill hold them long
as i can

  thats my play differed gary
youll take my pinto

  jack met this with a jeer we savvy
you want to alibi yourself think youll
drop out of the party before they get the
rope on me no go youll shove along
with connie only three shots left in my
rifle but ill put em where theyll do the
most good

  the three horses slanted up the ridge at
a walk as they crossed the rocky top
gary looked back and saw that the fore-
most pursuers had already gained a great

the blue

deal more but connie did not try to urge
her bronco out of his slow walk the beast
could go no faster until he had regained his
wind

  down behind the crest ledges jack
slipped off and crept back to peer over the
top gary kept on with connie his turn
would soon come at the next ridge he
would make connie change horses with
him

  though the pinto had covered all those
additional miles from the tonto to the box
r he still had more left in him than had
the short-winded bronco jacks roan also
looked comparatively fresh he and the
pinto could carry their riders to the rail-
road if given a little more leeway in addi-
tion to what jack was apt to gain by his
three shots the play would be to lie close
and wait for the bunch to come within
pistol range

  the still walking horses had covered lit-
tle more than a hundred paces down the
ridge slope when jack fired his first shot
a moment later he fired again then after
a brief pause he swung upon the roan and
jogged him down the slope the whine of
a ricocheted bullet told that shots were be-
ing aimed at the crest ledge over which
jack had fired

  when he came down alongside his sis-
ter his dark face showed no sign of ela-
tion he muttered discontentedly hate
to shoot horses got to think of you
though no telling what tonto would do
if i drilled his old peelers

  oh good cried connie you only
set them afoot they cant brand you a
killer 

  what of it ill be just as dead if
they string me up for only that lying
charge of rustling there were just the
two shots left im done

  no a little more and this give-out
bronc will catch his second wind

  to keep dragging along while certain that
all the pursuers still mounted must be
gaining at a gallop took real courage
connie did not quicken the bronco out of
his slow walk until the down-slope of the
ridge began to level off on a wide flat even
then she only put him into a fox-trot yet
either by chance or from shrewd calcu-
lation on her part the ridge-top lay a good
quarter-mile to the rear when the pursuers
burst up over the crest

  jacks sullen lips crooked in a grin

  say ol gal that dont look so worse
theyve picked up my pair of hoof-dusters


book magazine

if the bunch tries another rush the two
broncs packing double are bound to drag
lets ride said connie

  her horse had quit heaving and blowing
he slid readily into a lope the pinto and
roan also had been freshened by their rest
the pursuers trotted their horses down the
steepest part of the ridge-slope then put
them into a fast gallop

by robert ames bennet



pinto enough to drop into the rear posi-
tion jack did not heed the move like
connie he was peering intently ahead
gary glanced back again to his great sur-
prise he saw that the foremost pursuers
had slackened down to a lope

  he turned to call out the good news to
connie past jacks shoulder he glimpsed
the red top of the railroad water-tank

royd im go-
ing to get you
away jrom here
if i have to tie
you on the
horse

 connie scanned the ground ahead
changed the course slightly to the left and
urged her bronco into a run the race for
life was again tautened up to top speed
gary had ceased to wonder whether the
horses could hold out he was beginning
to doubt whether he himself could stay
much longer except for the short stop at
the box r ranch and the other stop for
lunch he had been in his saddle since sun-
rise the last of his newly regained
strength was oozing out of him

  yet somehow he continued to stick on the
pinto and somehow all three horses con-
tinued to pound along over the desert at
last connie headed up the draw approach
to a low saddle in a ridge that shut off all
view to the south

  gary felt himself almost done a back-
ward glance showed him the pursuers now
strung out in line with the foremost rather
nearer than they had been for some time
he decided that the ridge-saddle was his
limit he would stop in the little pass and
block it as long as he could that would
make sure of connie and jack reaching the
railroad

the three of them urged their fast-tiring
horses up the easy slope as they be-
gan to top the saddle gary pulled the

over the round of the ridge saddle two
more strides of the pinto brought a full view
of the railroad and little station the corral
and loading-chute and the big adobe store
all looked very close but gary had now
been long enough in arizona to realize they
were a full mile away

  jack looked back at the pursuers and
sang out to connie she at once moderated
the hard gallop to a lope the pinto
shifted to his single-footing gait to gary
it seemed almost as smooth as floating he
decided he could manage to keep going and
that his companions could make the rail-
road without need of his blocking the pass

  yet even with the easier riding that
last mile in was mostly a blur to him his
exhausted mind did not clear until the lit-
tle red station seemed suddenly to spring
up before him out of a mist he heard
jack shout to connie

  thats the ticket ol gal hop to it
wire em all-everyone we can count on
tell em to hitch the switch engine to an
empty and come a-running never mind if
go-getter gary

sutton horns in on the party theyll be
his posse

  connie was spurring her horse straight
ahead toward the station jack started to
crowd the pinto to the left

  heres your chance to show if youre
a white man or a yellow-streaked skunk
he challenged theyre still coming all
the same the two of us might hold off the
bunch till connies wires bring help

  yes-old fort gary jerked out his re-
ply unless lobo-bars us out

  hit for the front door ordered jack
shortly

  he angled toward the corral gate at the
rear of the big adobe gary swung the
pinto around the front comer and halted
before the door he was so outspent that
he fell as he slid down from his saddle
but he managed to stagger to his feet

  the heavy door was closed but not
locked gary half opened it and peered
in around the edge no shot blazed at him
from the cool interior he made out the
bottles on the old mahogany bar and tot-
tered in toward them one hand on a pistol
hilt still no sign of lobo leet ex-deputy-
sheriff

  he knocked the neck off a bottle of
ginger ale and gulped down the fizzy con-
tents that gave him strength enough to
get back to the door as he started to
shut it the sound of a heavy footstep
whirled him face about ready to shoot
it was jack not lobo

  gary thrust his pistols into their holster
pockets and wilted down all in royd
bar the door

  jacks suspicious eyes cleared

  bar it yourself he replied im going
to lead your pinto round to feed and water
hes earned it

  that brought gary to his feet jack
had slipped in upon him from the rear
door to see what treachery he was up to
now jack was going out in front well
aware that the man he had mistrusted need
only bar the rear door as well as the front
one to lock him out where he could not
escape from the gang this reliance on
his good faith was more refreshing to gary
than many bottles of ginger ale

  before shoving the door shut he looked
out and saw the pursuers only a few hun-
dred yards away they were riding
straight toward the store all of them be-
gan to fire but no bullets struck in or
near the doorway

  gary guessed that the vigilantes were

the blue

shooting at jack he barred the door
and staggered across to clamber up on
a barrel from it he peered out
through one of the high narrow loopholes
neither jack nor the pinto were in sight
gary went reeling and tottering into the
bunk-room its side door opened upon a
big messy kitchen from which the rear
door of the old-time fort-saloon-store gave
out into the private corral

  through the wide-open doorway gary
saw jack stripping the saddle off the pinto
the bridleless head of the tired thorough-
bred rose from a bucket with muzzle wet
but not dripping beyond the pinto and
jacks sag-headed roan a pair of lobo
leets broncos stood beside the hay-filled
feed-racks

  jack came in to dump garys saddle
atop hi own on the kitchen floor and to
eye gary with a reckless half-derisive grin

  aint i the gambling fool need only
tove hit out on one of those fresh broncs
to make my get-away yet here i am stak-
ing my neck that youll play square

  a sure-thing bet is no gamble royd
how about a jolt of hooch id rather
have coffee but times too short

  jack reached a bottle from a blind closet
three fingers of the liquid fire lifted gary
out of his collapse he streaked back into
the store leaving jack to bar the rear en-
trance he was greeted by two steel-jack-
eted bullets that shattered through the thick
oak door like tiny bombs

  keeping out of the line of fire he ran
forward to jump on a box and peer through
the loophole beside the door a little spurt
of dirt told of a bullet striking the edge of
the hole at the outer face of the three-foot
adobe wall gary wiped his eyes and
looked out again

tie caught a fleeting glimpse of riders

	 masked with neckerchiefs they were
circling to right and left the shots came
from behind low-growing thorn scrubs just
beyond pistol-range the two last men
dismounted by jack evidently had dropped
off from behind the riders who had brought
them in they were covering the front of
the store while the rest of the gang sought
to rush the rear

  gary shifted to a loophole in the end
of the store from it he saw no riders
but a kerchief-masked man was driving
connie and the station-agent around from
the front of the little station at the muzzle
of his pistol the vigilantes were missing


book magazine

no bets the station-agent could hardly
have had time to more than begin wiring
connies telegrams for help

  the vigilante started to rope his cap-
tives to a hitching-post gary was not
sure that his thirty-eights would carry true
at so long a range and the tying showed
that no harm was meant to connie at least
for the time being he did not fire at the
roper

  an outburst of shots and yells at the
rear of the store sent him hastening back
to the kitchen jack stood upon the table
beside a loophole his big forty-five auto-
matic in one hand and the whisky bottle
in the other he took a swig of the raw
moonshine and grinned

  got one of the dirty coyotes he said
the bobos thought theyd stampede the
hawses theyve another guess coming
and no chance of them breaking into
this old fort id say replied gary
here give me another jolt of that hooch
as he held up his hand for the bottle
a second burst of rifle bullets splintered
through the rear door jack turned to
peer from the loophole gary let the bot-
tle slip past his hand it smashed on the
floor jack jerked around and cursed
gary was scrambling up on the table a
pistol in each hand

  forget it he said just as well the
bottle dropped hooch doesnt help
straight shooting did you see any of the
gang close to

  a pair of em-both masked the one
i dropped crawled off but you win his
hawse is there beside ours he carried the
tonto brand vance isnt in on this
well im not so sure as i was dif-
fered gary drake didnt strike me as a
man whod do his killing behind a mask
another thing-miss connie doesnt know
how to telegraph does she

  no

  then why should a tonto man tie her
up along with the agent out on this side
of the station where we can see her
jacks face darkened he did lord
i never took tonto for that kind of a
skunk watch the scoundrels while i look
for lobos rifle

  wait said gary his eyes at the loop-
hole my guess is his rifles out there
look at the stringy guy giving out orders
over in the big corral carries his right
arm inside his shirt thats the arm i
broke at curlew slough

  what jack took a look through the

by robert ames bennet



narrow slit youre right the one afoot
-thats lobo couldnt mistake those
longhorn legs of his only how come hes
with tonto all during the round-up that
squint-eyed red devil kept throwing up
how youd bitten the forelegs of vances
two-gun wolf

  he did royd theres something
crooked in this deal tonto horses but
all the gang masked and lobo leet boss-
ing the operations i begin to believe-
stow it broke in jack somethings
coming off around in front may be going
to ram the door hop to it

  garys quick leap from the table was
followed by the heavier thud of jacks
down-jump

chapter xxii

as gary and jack dashed through the
bunk-room into the store both held
their pistols ready to fire but the heavy
front door had not been burst in its bar
still held fast though the thick oak
planks showed many bullet-holes they gave
out no thudding such as would have been
made by the smashes of a log battering-
ram

  a look through front loopholes showed
four of the besiegers lined up out beyond
pistol shot but their backs were to the
old fort-store still farther out six riders
rifles in hand were slanting across toward
the station none of them had their faces
masked

  vance exclaimed jack i called the
wrong card owen hes come to ask why-
for the necktie-party look hes spotted
connie

  five of the riders suddenly swung off
behind their horses to level their rifles at
the four masked men their boss sprinted
his horse ahead to the station

  jack and gary shifted to end-wall loop-
holes in time to see austell leap from his
horse in a flying dismount pistol to pis-
tol he confronted the masked man who had
tied up connie and the station-agent after
what looked like an exchange of threats
the two appeared to reach some kind of
agreement both holstered their pistols
and the masked man backed off a few steps
austell then hastened to untie connie

  with the girl walking between them the
two men started straight across toward
the store jack growled a curse and lifted
his pistol ready to shoot
go-getter gary

  hold on said gary miss connie is
waving her handkerchief theyre coming
to talk

  ill talk to that tonto sneak with lead
muttered jack

  but he did not shoot even when the
three came within close pistol-range the
masked man had discreetly dropped back
behind connie the party disappeared
around the corner of the store

  when gary and jack shifted to front
loopholes they found the three callers be-
fore the door the masked man still back
of connie austell stood side by side with
the girl his look no less anxious than hers
hey jack he sang out you there
sitting pretty replied jack whats
doing

  austell indicated the masked man with a
jerk of his thumb

  looks like trouble buddy wy saw
them shoving you toward the rails he
hit for the ranch to tell me i picked up
all my boys within reach and came to ask
how-come this tonto peeler claims you
collected a bunch of their calves and
broncs

  its a dirty lie shouted jack ive
rustled no tonto stock

the masked man pulled his hat-brim low
and let down his neckerchief enough
below his nose to yell back threateningly
youre the liar royd sheriff hisself
found the boss calves an hawses you rus-
tled tonto went an seen the calves you
switched the hawses fore he got there
ill talk to no sneak whos afraid to
show his face jack countered wheres
tonto try to frame me will he i want
to tell him hes a cross between a rattler
and a hydrophobia skunk

  the masked man appeared to hesitate
then as austell turned to stare at him he
yelled louder than before

  jest you wait yuh hawse-thief tontos
trailing them rustled broncs soons he gets
here well dynamite yuh out yore hole an
string you up to a telegraph pole long-
side yore dude desperado

  gary saw his chance to cut in

  well be delighted to see mr drake
while waiting for his arrival you might go
around and tell lobo leet im wearing the
star that sheriff sutton took away from
him and gave to me as a special deputy
the look of concern on austells hand-
some face suddenly vanished in a red flare
of anger

the blue

  thats another lie he charged sut-
tons not fool enough to trust a killer he
went to arrest where is he why didnt
he go with you to take royd you cant
answer that because youve murdered him
you shot him down in cold blood when he
was fetching you from the tonto ranch
you bungling tinhorn called back
gary cant slip a card out of your sleeve
without fumbling it youve spilled your
game how did you know sutton sent
me to take royd you cant prove it
youve shown yourself up as a liar

  as gary had calculated rage so blinded
austell that he stumbled into the trap

  you slick killer cant prove it cant
i sutton told me himself-uh-uh-i
mean he-

  yes broke in gary he reported it to
you at the trail butte where you were lay-
ing for me-where you left your masked
men waiting to get both me and royd
austell dodged behind connie barely in
time to miss the bullet from jacks roaring
forty-five he crouched back of the girl
gripping her fast by the elbows the
masked man crouched in line directly be-
hind him

  you skulking coyote jack yelled out
at him stand clear and take your medi-
cine you yellow-streaked coward 

  yes i will flung back austell must
think im a crazy fool-like yourself here
i try to pull you out of a bad hole and
you crack down on me at the word of a
city killer

  at your own bean-spilling corrected
jack you let out you talked with sut-
ton after you said owen had killed sut-
ton

  no i saw sutton before-on his way
to the tonto to take owen-after he missed
him at your ranch

  gary cut in again you didnt see
him then-else hed have told you about
his finding rustled stock on royds home
range you didnt meet him then and
he didnt tell you anything i know he
didnt he didnt say a word to me about
meeting you

  why should he you alley sneak

but why shouldnt you go out yourself
to warn royd against drake youve
been claiming to be royds best friend
austell was too clever to be caught twice
in the same way

  ill answer you with a rope -jack you
cant have gone plumb loco heres a big-
ger bunch of tontos-more men than ive


book magazine	by robert ames bennet



got with me theyre itching to stnng you
up with suttons murderer they claim
that drake and the rest of his peelers
are heading in i cant stand off the whole
outfit turn your gun on that alley rat
and ill fix these tontos before the old kill-
er gets here

  but jacks suspicions were now fixed as

connie safe inside flashed upon gary but
his call to her brother passed unheeded
jack was already shouting his derision

  bah think id fall for that bunk if
you couldnt outshoot us yourself youd
send a man through to let lobo in at the
back door

  that was the limit for austell he gave

oh cried connie its
some one on the butte hes
signaling with a mirror

stubbornly against austell as they had been
against gary

  prove it he challenged lay out that
sneak behind you and send connie to untie
the agent a wire will get sutton and a
posse here before tonto can clean us up

  connie found a chance to give out a bit
of encouraging news

  therell be a posse coming with or
without mr sutton winton managed to
wire my first message before we were held
up by this man

a ustell let go of connie to twist half
about and cover the puncher behind
him with his pistol the fellow threw up
his hands

  all right now jack vance called i
wont let connie risk the run to the station
open the door ill slide in with my boys
we can easily hold off drake till the posse
comes

  a way to outfox the schemer and get

over his pretense of holding up the masked
man and faced front again to level his
pistol over connies slender shoulder

  you bobo he shouted here im
risking my life to hold the bunch off you
yet you turn me down cold-you try your
best to shoot me im through i quit
just what i thought you were-a yellow
quitter gibed jack

  this last jab stung austell into showing
his hand he fired through jacks loop-
hole the bullet flipped off jacks back-
pushed hat it would have drilled his fore-
head if he had not been crouched to peer
along the barrel of his pistol

  as gary looked to see if jack had been
hit a screaming bullet ricocheted in at his
own loophole a hasty glimpse showed
the upraised hand and pistol of the man
behind austell garys snap shot in return
go-getter gary

shattered the pistol butt and the hand that
grasped it with a howl the man leaped
up and started to run only to pitch upon
his face shot in the leg by jack

dullets from austells automatic came
flying back through the loopholes the
fight was on in deadly earnest yet even
when austell stopped to reload he kept so
close behind connie that neither jack nor
gary dared fire at him gary could have
put any number of shots into a dollar circle
at the distance but his nerve failed him
when it came to the risk of shooting so
close to connies head

  the wounded man had scrambled up and
was hopping away in wild haste to get be-
yond pistol-range the other masked men
and the five hat-on punchers had given
over their pretense of mutual hostility all
were bunching together with rifles pointed
at the store

  in the blank hush that followed his
burst of fire austell called out from behind
the terrified girl damn you jack
hope that got you and your killer side-
kick you calf-rustling horse-thief

  jack choked with rage but gary said it
for him how nice that sounds from a
perfect gent protecting a lady

  ill be protecting her long after you are
buzzard meat replied austell you too
jack if she doesnt come through shell
agree right here and now to marry me or
i pull out and leave you to the bunch along
with your city killer

  oh-h gasped connie oh no no
you cant-not either of them oh
please 

  austells already angry voice shook with
jealous fury hell so thats it youve
fallen for the killer dude that cinches
it im going to have you or ill make
sure both of them get the rope ill help
dig out the pair then leave them to drakes
peelers therell be no questions asked
owen is wanted for murder and drake has
a dead open-and-shut case on jack for that
rustling

  connie threw up her hands before her
eyes she cried out in an agony of despair
you-oh you-devil

  all right anything youve a mind to
call me girl im willing to go to hell to
get you only dont forget i always get
what i go for

  connie shouted jack throw your-
self drop down-down

  the move would have left austell ex-

the blue

posed but even if connie could have
rallied enough from the paralysis of her
dread and terror to have attempted to drop
down she could not have wrenched herself
out of austells powerful grasp

  the failure of the stratagem transmuted
the jealous rage of her captor into sneering
derision

  another trick misplayed buddy he
mocked me-ive got the stakes heads
i win tails you lose what i get i hold
shes going to marry me to double-
cinch the bargain shes going with me now
only difference if she accepts my ring and
goes willingly i call off my lobos if she
doesnt i take her along anyway and leave
the pack to finish the job

  no oh no cried connie dont-

dont let themi-ill agree to-

  youll not shouted jack if he
takes you promise or no promise ill kill
him on sight first chance i get

  thats enough you horse-thief replied
austell id have backed you against
tonto and the law now youll get what
youve asked for here goes

  he lifted connie just enough to back off
with her within a few steps he stumbled
against a clump of prickly pears but man-
aged to sidle around it without once ex-
posing himself to garys leveled pistol

  the slam of the heavy door-bar jerked
garys gaze sideways jack had jumped
down from the loophole on the other side of
the door he was heaving the door open as
he lunged past it gary grasped his arm
but jack wrenched free with a violence that
slammed gary hard against the door jamb

  before gary could recover enough from
the shock to make another clutch jack
jumped out sideways to rush after austell
a flight of bullets thudded into the three-
foot thickness of the adobe wall jack had
crouched to leap the old hitch-rail he spun
around in the air he was pitching on his
face before the roar of the rifles reached
garys ears

  more bullets thudded into the wall
others flung up sand in garys face as he
made his rush for jack his jumps from
side to side spoiled the aim of the riflemen
but during the much longer time it took
to drag jack back to the doorway sheer
luck alone saved him-unless the frantic
screams of connie helped by shaking the
nerve of the bunched gang

  the hail of bullets struck all around
gary pierced his clothes fanned his face
yet somehow he managed to drag his help-

less burden clear into the old building and
to one side of the doorway

  one of the bullets that pierced the oak
planks as he heaved the door shut drove a
splinter into his right arm he jammed
the bar fast in its socket and sprang clear
to tear the oak splinter out of his flesh

  bullets continued to smash through the
door and thud into the adobe wall as
gary climbed on his barrel stand an in-
spraying spurt of dust and grit told that
a bullet had angled into the loophole
though others might follow at any mo-
ment gary peered out

  two of the hat-on men each with a
horse in lead were riding to meet austell
and connie austell already beyond pis-
tol-range was dragging the girl along be-
side him regardless of her desperate strug-
gles to break free

  the men with the horses came near
connies frenzied fight suddenly stppped
she slumped to the ground gary felt cer-
tain she must have fainted but austell
did not let go of her until he had lifted her
up into the grasp of the nearer rider he
then jumped on one of the led-horses took
the girl from his man and loped away
toward the hat-on road

  the two riders trotted back to the group
of their fellow-punchers probably to deliver
austells final orders regarding the attack
after a briefc stop they galloped away after
their boss

chapter xxiii

a muttered curse from jack reached
garys ears between the cracking roar
of the rifle-shots gary jumped down to
bend over the man he had thought dead

  he now had time to look close at the
blue weal made by the bullet that had
struck jacks temple instead of piercing
the skull the bullet had glanced from the
end of the hard eye-socket bone

  jack had only been knocked out not
killed he was struggling back to semi-
consciousness growling curses in a dazed
perhaps delirious rage his clothes like
garys seemed to be riddled with bullet-
holes gary jerked open the tattered shirt
a bullet had nipped jacks side just above
his broad belt another had scorched
across his breast over his heart probably
as he whirled in his fall

  but gary could see no fatal wound he
ran to fetch bottles of ginger ale from

the old bar a spurt of fizz in jacks face
brought him out of his daze he staggered
to his feet

  connie he shouted and he lurched
toward the door

  gary dragged him back

  wait you bonehead we want to help
her cant do it by committing suicide
come back weve got to shoot our way
out past lobo must have horses aus-
tells carrying her to the hat-on

  as jack rushed for the bunk-room door
he reached for his pistol his hand struck
the top of the empty holster he halted
in his tracks

  gun gone must a dropped it-out
there

  go on urged gary my pair is
enough

  midway of their rush through the bunk-
room they met the smell of burning hay
the kitchen was hazy with smoke bun-
dles of lighted hay had been thrust through
the loopholes and more hay was being
prodded in to drop on the flaring fires

  garys burst of shots through each loop-
hole put a sudden stop to the poking jack
had headed for the barrel from which hung
a water dipper but he swerved to catch
up a butcher knife from beside the stove
and plunge its blade into a pile of sacked
flour

  hurled upon the burning table the first
ripped sack smothered the fire with a
splurge of white powder more bursting
sacks snuffed out the other fires

  gary jumped up onto the smoking table
he jerked in the hay that wadded up the
loophole but when he sought to peer
through the opening he found his view
fogged by a thick swirl of smoke outside

  the door he called down to jack
theyre burning the door must have a
big fire stacked against it

  got us holed up here shouted jack
well have to make our break out front

ary dashed after him back into the
store but even jack recoiled from the
front door whether or not the riflemen
had come closer their bullets were splin-
tering through the door faster than ever
their shots appeared to be aimed at the
side opposite the hinges and at the height
of the bar

  even as gary halted behind jack to the
left of the doorway the thick oak bar shat-
tered in two its end fell out of the socket
in the door-jamb the door began to give
go-getter gary



the blue

back before the shock of the striking bul-
lets

  no chance here gary cried out the
obvious fact theyd drill us sure we
must make our get-away or we cant help
connie if only we could jump through
that rear door fire cant be many of them
there

  jack started to reply and halted to stare
at the stream of dirt that was falling upon
the old bar hells bells he cursed
theyre digging through the roof

  let them said gary this is get-
ting too thick im an officer defending my
prisoner its past time for winging em
ill get the first lyncher that shows his
head

  no such luck growled jack lobo
savvies his job must have the store in-
sured thats dynamite longside the
barbed wire theyll shove in a burning
haystack and back off to pick up the
pieces

  dynamite cried gary dynamite

  yeah boy vance must a remembered
it and left word for lobo how to proceed
say your prayers buddy were a pair
of hell-bent bobos theres two-three hun-
dred pounds of the stuff vance ordered for
his new dam most any bullet is apt to jar
it off once the door swings open the
box of caps is next the dynamite scuse
me ill take my chances of dodging shots
cmon

  but gary gripped his arm

  no i remember-dynamite at a big
fire brace the door and chase back to the
kitchen

pary spoke with more assurance than
he felt but he had to head off jack
from another rush out into that deadly
rifle-fire only half convinced jack heaved
three or four cases of canned goods against
the door

  by the time he reached the bar gary
had a box of dynamite broken open and
had snatched up two sticks of dynamite
along with the cap-box and a coil of fuse

  though no more burning hay had been
poked into the kitchen smoke was pouring
in through the loopholes it was also seep-
ing in at every crevice of the door except
the inch-wide crack on the threshold where
the cool inner air of the room was sucking
outward

  gary capped and fused one stick of
dynamite and nodded to jack through the
deepening haze of smoke

  stand on this side with the saddles if
it works we can hot-foot out ill handle
the gats while you saddle up

  shoot shouted jack

tie swung the saddles onto his shoulder

    gary stooped and reached out side-
ways to flick his bomb through the crack
under the door with all his quickness
his hand and arm had barely jerked clear
when the roaring explosion bulged in the
lower part of the ponderous door flame
smoke embers hot dirt spurted through
the gaping cracks

  yet in an instant the door sprang back
into place though its lower planks were
shattered it had not been blown off its
old hand-wrought hinges the bar also had
held gary kicked the door to loosen the
jammed bar slid the bar out of its socket
and gave the door a hard tug inward

  the dynamite had more than blown the
flaming heap of fuel to pieces the shock
of its concussion had put the fire out
through the whirling smoke gary saw the
horses plunging at the far side of the small
corral

  as he dashed out toward them over the
smoking bits of wood he caught sight of
wy unmasked gaping around the corner of
the hayrack the big foremans six-shooter
was leveled toward the door but his as-
tonishment over the explosion slowed his
pull on the trigger just a split second too
long

  gary could not break the habit that had
become second nature to him his shot
was aimed only to hit wys shoulder as
the six-shooter fell wys left hand thrust
skyward gary ran past him and whirled
to look up on the dirt roof of the building

  one of the two men on top was still dig-
ging with a shovel the other stood wait-
ing with an ax ready to chop the roof
poles at sight of gary he dropped the
ax and pulled his gun gary winged him
the shoveler threw up his hands

  jack had run past toward the horses a
shot knocked the saddles off his shoulder
he jerked them around to serve as a shield
and yelled warningly gary had already
whirled to face to the right as lobo leet
popped one eye out past the corner of
the wall to fire gary let drive from the
hip with both guns

  he did not wait to see the lank body of
the killer hit the dust he jerked one pis-
tol around at the man on the roof the
shoveler had started to lower his arms

thats it gary called to him turn
your back and toss your gun over your

shouldergood now get to your

digging-raise a dust you other bird
swing up that ax

both men hastened to obey gary sidled
around to pick up wys six-shooter he
nodded to the scowling foreman

save miss connie from that devil austell
wys heavy face had gone haggard from
the pain of his shattered shoulder-joint
but he forgot the agony in a flare of right-
eous wrath

  go get the skunk kid me an lobo
ony laid with the bunch at the butte to
dry-gulch you it was austell rustled them

down behind
the crest ledges
jack slipped off
and crept back
to peer cautious-
ly over the top

  you can flop your wing down now
im borrowing your gun for jack he
dropped his when he tried to stop your
boss from kidnaping his sister

  kidnap muttered wy aw bunk
austell is a devil but not that kind he
wouldnt hurt miss connie

  step to the corner with me and take a
look he dragged her off-took her on
his horse unless theres a dip in the
ground theyll still be in sight

hthe foremans jaw sagged  fore god
i knowed he was bad but id a swore
he wasnt that bad

  who worked the frame-up on jack
planting that rustled tonto stock on his
range asked gary was it you or aus-
tell or lobo

  the last name sent wys glance darting
toward the body sprawled in the dust at
the comer of the wall

  kid i got to hand it to yuh thats
the second time i seen yuh beat lobo at
trigger-twiggling yuh could a popped me
off like a calf all yuh done was bust my
shoulder cause why

  couldnt help it with lobo said gary
he showed only his head and i had to
stop him jack and i are on our way to

tonto broncs we rode it was him used
a running-iron on them calves to frame-up
royd slicker work now for him to go
an take miss connie hope you lay him
out like you done lobo 

  a shout from jack and the pounding of
hoofs told gary the horses were saddled
he glanced around expecting to see his
pinto but jack was on one of lobos
broncos and leading the other both ani-
mals were still high-strung and quivering
from their fright over the dynamite explo-
sion

  gary handed wys revolver to jack and
jammed both his own guns tight in their
holsters as he expected the bronco
started to plunge and whirl around in
circles when he tried to mount he never
could have made his saddle had not jack
grabbed the broncos bridle and buttressed
his own horse against the dancing animals
off side

  the moment gary was in his saddle
jack let go and spurred his bronco for the
corral entrance at a bucking run garys
bronco also crow-hopped though fortu-
nately he did not pitch as hard as jacks
gary was able to stick on

  even more fortunately the attackers had
left the corral gate open while jack and
go-getter gary



the blue

gary were intent upon the fractious bron-
cos the unwounded man on the roof had
found courage to drop his shovel and pull
his gun the fast-banging automatic must
have dropped both jack and gary before
they cleared the corral if their horses had
not been plunging so wildly

jack fired back one shot between pitches
gary had too much to do staying in his
saddle to shoot at all but the broncos
swirled through the open gateway side by
side without crashing against the gate
posts and once clear of the corral they
lined out at a dead run that quickly took
them beyond pistol-range from the build-
ing

  the gate was at the far end of the cor-
ral away from the station the big adobe
building the feed-rack and a shed had hid-
den from the men out in front all that was
happening in the corral the upflung
hands on the roof had been offset by their
quick lowering and the resumption of the
shovel work

  owing to the combination of luck quick
shooting quick saddling and quick wit the
outslipping pair got away to a flying start
but gary felt none too easy even after his
bronco settled down to straight running and
the man on the roof had stopped his erratic
shooting

  with his unbroken arm the wounded man
had started to signal the bunch out in front
when jack and gary raced into sight on
the open ground some of the bunch were
already mounting their horses the others
swung their rifles around gary wondered
why they did not at once open fire then
he guessed that they could not make out
the wounded signalers shouts and gestures
they were uncertain whether one or both
of the hasty riders belonged to their own
crowd

  the delay was hardly more than mo-
mentary such experienced punchers had
only to get an eyeful of garys riding to see
that he was no cowboy vet their brief
hesitation meant many yards to horses run-
ning at top speed also the breaks of the
game were still with jack and gary the
men who had not jumped for their horses
happened to have only a cartridge or two
left in their rifles these first shots missed
before the riflemen could reload jack
swerved off to the right and jumped his
bronco into a broad wash gary made the
leap after him just as the rifles cracked
loose again

  the wash wound away to the east of
north and its gravelly bed was hard going
but unlike all the other horses the broncos
were fresh jack kept them on a run until
well beyond rifle-shot from the bunch afoot
at the next break in the bank of the wash
he jumped his horse up onto the level des-
ert

   though the sprint had dropped the pur-
suing horsemen farther to the rear they
were still within range and coming fast
along the bank of the wash they at once
spread out and opened fire

   jack bent forward over his saddlehorn
to spur his bronco into another burst of
speed garys horse followed his leader in
this second sprint it was a killing pace
even for the toughest of desert-bred horses
gary now realized why jack had not re-
saddled their own horses

  the fresh broncos literally ran away
from the pursuers the following horses
already tired by their chase from the butte
could not hold up under the strain they
soon slowed down the rifle-fire also
slackened even at the first none of the
shots had come near any hit with a rifle
bullet fired from a galloping horse is a sheer
accident

ljalf a mile more and the outdistanced
pursuers gave up shooting none the
less they followed along as best they could
jack had been angling a little to the left
he and gary struck into the hat-on trail
that proved to the gang that the pair were
after their boss they might yet catch
them between two fires

   jack eased the pace down to a moderate
gallop and signed for gary to come up be-
side him

   buddy he said you pulled it off
that dynamite stunt and the way you
nailed lobo i dont give a damn if you
are a killer side with me till i get vance
and ill side with you till hell freezes over

  no replied gary were not going
for him its for connie

   same thing snapped jack

   gary did not answer the ride from the
tonto out to the box r and all the way
in to the rails had fairly wrecked him
atop that had come the gun-fight at the
old fort-store and now this second ride for
life--

   no it was not a ride for life-it was as
he had said for connie had it been
only to save his own life or jacks he must
have dropped off the galloping bronco he
book magazine

was all in-used up yet he could not give
way he had to keep going- connie
needed his help

chapter xxiv

the pursuing bunch of hat-on riders
had been distanced nearly a mile when
gary sighted austell and his pair of fol-
lowers rounding the end of a ridge half as
far ahead

  the three horses were walking this
may have been due to the fact that aus-
tells horse was carrying double more
probably austell having gotten connie be-
yond sight of the rails was taking his time
his idea may have been to loiter along
until his gang could finish the penned-in
victims and overtake him

  jacks eyes were better trained than
garys to interpret distant movements
he flung out his clenched fist and shouted
a curse

  what-is it panted gary spurring up
beside him

  theyve spotted us buddy didnt you
see em duck vancell mosey along and
leave his pair of black-jacks to pick us off
bound to get us from cover even if i had
a hatful of rifle clips no wait

  the sullen ruddy-brown eyes flared with
reckless elation

  its the big arroyo road skirts its
bank back alongside of that ridge theres
a fool-killer cut-across only thing you
couldnt make it

  gary did not hesitate ill stick to the
road-keep them busy while you head him
off

  the look jack gave him was ample pay
for the offer

  the road kept on until close to the rocky
barrier of the ridge before it twisted off to
the right to stretch for the turn around
the ridge end at the twist a barranca cut
down the ridge to continue as a small ar-
royo or wash that drained into the big
arroyo

  jack cut up the steep boulder-strewn bed
of the barranca gary crossed over the
wash and galloped ahead to where the sharp
bend of the big arroyo pinched the road
tight against the end of the ridge

  the bronco still galloping strong rapidly
lessened the distance to the turn they
came within close range of it even an
ordinary rifle-man could not have failed to
hit his mark so near at hand yet still

no bullets came cracking to knock gary
out of his saddle

  there was the chance that the two
guards had guessed jacks stratagem and
ridden on to protect their boss at the
thought gary bent forward over his sad-
dlehorn to spur his bronco into a sprint
and then-

  the bullet that had been aimed for his
heart pierced through the muscle at the left
base of his neck missing the jugular vein
less than an inch the other bullet drilled
his hat brim

ljis jerk on the bit swerved the bronco to
the left so suddenly that the second
pair of bullets both missed a moment
later the animal crashed through a big
thorn bush gary already tottering for a
fall was clawed out of his saddle by the
hooked thorns

  the shock did not quite stun him as
instinctively as a dazed boxer counters a
blow he rolled sideways behind a shelter-
ing boulder here was safety at least for
a few moments he dropped flat on his
chest utterly spent

  yet even before he caught his breath
which had been knocked out of him by
his fall the thought of connie again started
to galvanize his nerves to renewed effort
through his hot brain flashed mental pic-
tures of the two riflemen racing on along
the road-of jack shot down like himself
-of austell making his get-away with con-
nie

  that last stung his lax muscles like the
lashing strokes of a rawhide quirt he
struggled to his knees the thorn-torn
bronco had swung back into the road and
come to a quivering snorting halt he
might possibly stand still for his rider to
remount but at best that would mean
stepping out from behind the boulder to
where the hidden riflemen would have clear
aim

qn the other hand there was no other
 cover for several yards up the rocky
pitch of the ridge as gary hesitated he
noticed the blood that dripped from his
neck down upon the back of his left hand
he wadded his neckerchief into both ends
of the wound this gave him time to re-
call his promise to jack that he would keep
the riflemen busy

  a rush straight at the bronco would have
sent the beast off on the jump gary
steadied himself and walked briskly out
go-getter gary

from behind the boulder at an angle to
bring the bronco between him and the place
from which the shots had been fired

  the bronco shied around to eye him
but no more shots broke the hot hush of
the desert afternoon the conviction seized
upon gary that his ambushers had ridden
on to get jack he had need of all his
self-control to keep from rushing the
bronco

  the animal was all too uneasy even over
his riders slow sideward approach but
gary spoke to him soothingly and kept his
hands down when the bronco started to
whirl away from him he managed by quick
footwork to step on the trailing reins

  still no bullets came driving to complete
the work of the first one the bronco
once caught stood quiet spurred by des-
peration gary jerked his foot up into the
stirrup and fairly jumped on

the jab of his spurs sent the bronco
bounding along the road the plung-
ing beast grazed the brink of the twenty-
foot drop-off into the arroyo and swerved
sharply along it to the left

  gary did not heed how narrowly they
were shaving the edge of destruction his
gaze had fixed upon the sloping far bank
where through the thin foliaged tops of the
arroyos trees he saw two riders spur up
over the edge to race away eastward at
top speed

  before he could guess what this meant
his bronco sprinted on around the sharp
point of the ridge to where the road
straightened out not two hundred paces
ahead austell was back-trailing at a dead
run he still had connie gripped fast be-
fore him

  close behind the kidnaper jack raced to
overtake him yelling and flourishing wys
six-shooter like a madman but strangest
of all down the west slope beyond jack
were flying a whole bunch of wild riders

  gary surmised that the new gang were
drake and his outfit coming to lynch jack
for the rustling all the more reason to
hasten the rescue of connie no it would
be better to let austell get past then over-
haul him during the run away from the
tonto outfit

  but austell did not give gary time to
turn out of the road at sight of him he
had started to pull his horse as he
wheeled the animal around he thrust out
his pistol for a pop shot

  jack saw the movement in time to duck

by robert ames bennet



forward and jerk the head of his bronco
upward shot through the brain the
bronco pitched down hurling jack heels
over head

  as gary fired into the air in an attempt
to divert austells attention he saw con-
nie struggling to wrest austells pistol out
of his grasp she might be able to cling
to it a few seconds while garys sprinting
bronco brought him up alongside the two
gary dug in his spurs

  but his shot had served only to warn
austell that instant action was needed
unable to free his pistol from connies
clutch austell jumped off his horse with
her a sideward wrench flung the girl to
one side he thrust out his pistol jack
had struggled up on one elbow the old
six-shooter- roared

  austell staggered back the pistol fell
from his down-sinking hand he- swayed
clutched at his waist and crumpled slowly
to the ground

  gary was reining in his bronco but he
did not stop the quickness with which
connie had picked herself up showed that
she had not been badly hurt no need
to look twice at austell to see he was done
for but the tonto bunch were coming
fast with drake several lengths in the
lead

  after that one shot jack had flattened
down he lay motionless gary stopped
the bronco beside him and slid out of the
saddle though the ground reeled under
him like a boat in choppy waves he man-
aged to balance himself from falling

  before his dizzy eyes the swiftly swelling
form of the tonto bunchs leader split into
two drakes but what of that he had
a gat for each of those red-faced squint-
eyed twins he steadied the guns one at
each side of his belt and called a sharp
warning

  halt royds my prisoner

  the twin horses and drakes slithered to
a stop in a cloud of dust-and suddenly
ceased to be twins the one scowling drake
roared an angry remonstrance

  let up kid royds all right its aus-
tell im after

mine punchers came piling up behind
their leader in rapid succession garys
clearing gaze recognized lin and others of
the box r men drake was unbuckling
the rope from his saddle he growled an
explanation

  i got royds boys with me kid aus-
tell done the rustling we been tracking
him the hawse he rode was in his round-
up string got a bar cross the nigh hind
shoe count of a split hoof quit yore
fooling now and lemme by im going to
put my rope on him

  gary did not lower his pistols

  no hes my prisoner the sheriff
deputized me therell be no lynching

  jack was pulling himself up on his knees
he turned his scratched dirt-grimed face
toward drake

  youre too late tonto i beat you to
it he said with no trace of exultance in
his husky voice my shot went low but
-vance wont need the rope

  all right that goes agreed drake and
he dropped his rope

  gary shoved his pistols into their hol-
sters as he swayed over drake sprang
in to keep him from falling gary twisted
around in those bear-like supporting arms
he had something to say to connie before
he went under

  she had knelt beside austell hold-
ing his head and shoulders up against her
his hand was moving on the top of his
thigh-scrawling with a pencil on a piece
of paper

 jack staggered up he and drake
and the men all moved forward and gary
found himself moving with them held on
his feet by drakes powerful grasp

  austell stopped his slow scrawling he
lifted the paper and pencil in his heavy
hand his upturning face was ghastly gray



connies frenzied fight
stopped and she slumped
to the ground

and rigid from agony yet he spoke with
startling distinctness

my-will sign-witness

jack hesitated then reached down and
took the paper he stared at the writing
in a puzzled way

uh-just that bill-of-sale i gave you-
canceled

no gasped the dying man other
side

the paper turned over in jacks shak-
ing hand he stared at the words that
sprawled aslant the creased sheet

all he muttered you give all your
property to connie

  the girl cried out in protest oh no
no vance i-i couldnt take it-from
you 

  he twisted his head up and backward
to peer at her through the glaze that had
already dimmed the bright blue of his
eyes

  connie im bad-own it bound for-
hell got jack into scrapes let me pay
-pay what i cangod how i love

you-

  what connie saw in those darkening eyes
gary could not tell but he saw the up-
welling flood of tenderness that swept the
repulsion and horror from her face he
saw her bend low and stroke austells
sweat-beaded forehead

  his own eyes went dark he became
vaguely aware that his back and chest were
wet from the reopened wound in his neck
then blackness fell upon him

chapter xxv

vvaves-cool waves and the stifling heat
of midsummer on his favorite lake
shore bathing beach gary felt himself
afloat with the rollers breaking over him

  then he realized that the waves were
striking only his head and face 
they became small gushes of water that
flashing glare above his head was not a
searchlight  it was a sun-glinting bit of
metal on a canteen

the mouth of the canteen pressed against
go-getter gary



the blue

his opening lips he swallowed and gazed
up into the friendly eyes of jack royd
the bruised lips below the skinned nose
twisted in an encouraging half-grin

  keep a-coming buddy youre making
the grade

  gary groped for speech and managed to
whisper a word connie

  just hit out to fetch a wagon soons
she saw youd be  k that fool hat-on
bunch had the gall to show themselves
down the road tonto and the boys went
to bring them into camp

  austell

the smiling eyes clouded with regret
 cashed in if only i hadnt-but it
was him or me 

  yes agreed gary that bitter taste of
failure and loss in his mouth its bound
to happen sooner or later no matter how
good you think you are at handling a gat
were a pair of killers but youre her
brother that lets you out

  jack stared down at him and started to
reply but blurred into a mumbled mutter
about locoed bobos he backed off to
swing a sag-headed bronco around so that
its shadow fell upon gary

  though garys arms felt heavy as lead
he tried to pull them up to feel what was
pressing so tight on the side of his neck

  quit it ordered jack lie still you
dont want to open up that hole again
weve got it hog-tied but no telling what
itll do if you keep squirming

  gary let his hands go lax and lay still
after all he and jack had saved connie
what did anything else matter the
shadow of the horse added to the grateful
coolness from the wetting by the water out
of the canteen he felt very tired it
would be good to go to sleep now-and
forget

  he roused to the sound of a bluff voice
that boomed with rather oily heartiness
by-jakes chief of police you say
that shooting kid is going to keep his star
if i have to cram it down his throat
shore yuh will sutton came back a
grimly humorous reply in the voice of
tonto drake youll keep him for yore
deputy till we cain vote him in as sheriff
how bout them other letters miss con-
nie

a bove garys opening eyes appeared
 neither blue sky nor stars but a rough
lamplit ceiling his neck was still too

tightly bound for him to be able to turn
his head but connies voice sounded
closer than the others it had an odd
quaver

  oh yes mr drake this one from
the payroll delivery company is still bet-
ter listen to whom it may concern
this is to certify that gary owen resigned
from our force to become a special officer
we employ no man who can not show a
hundred per cent record as regards both
character past history and ability as pay-
roll guard before we began to use armored
cars owen helped to prevent five at-
tempted hold-ups each time he was the
guard mainly responsible for saving the
money and capturing the bandits he
never missed a shot yet never killed a
man 

  drake gave the fat sheriff another dig

fool notion is just to puncture their gat
fins the reward for killers and bank-
robbers dead is double what he gets for

  connie paused to catch her breath then
went on still more quaveringly

   all the same he has been my head
gun in breaking up one mafia blackhand
bunch and three bootleg gangs also he
blocked two attempts to bump me off
last time he got hit broke the gunmans
shoulders from the floor the gangs call

come to draw on me up to fifty grand 
huh grunted tonto drake
book magazine	gy robert ames bennet



   the voice of jack chipped in a bit of
 modern knowledge a grand is a thou-
 sand dollars

   say looky here- drakes freckled
 fist appeared above garys side to level a
 thick forefinger at his face you young
 son-of-a-gun you dont need no grands to
 buy into the tonto im raring to hitch
 up with a pard thatll be a sort of-uh-
 son-a kid with sand and the savvy

   again it was jack who replied were
 both too late tonto the hat-on got in
 first bid

   gary was still puzzling over what this
 could mean when a quiet remark from con-
 nie ended the long-drawn moment of
 silence

   mr drake why cant we make it a
 kind of family matter weve had too
 much of the opposite i-i cant stand
 any more of it cant you consider jack
 and me as a sort of son-in-law and a sort
 of daughter-in-law

   huh huh yuh little cuss dyuh
 mean-

   hush connies voice almost shrilled
 he must be quiet its time you went

 lje heard a sudden scraping of feet
 and chairs and a gruff chuckle from
 drake followed by sheriff suttons stage
 whisper the lucky dude

   the sound of footsteps lessened a door
 closed the hush convinced gary that he
 had been left alone he sought to relieve
 his feelings with a groan

   almost instantly connies face appeared
 above his head her hand touched his
 forehead and started to stroke it-as it had
 stroked austells forehead remembrance
 of that made him flinch

   dont im not fit-no more than he
 was im not only a gunman im a killer

-now lobo-

   ho jack told me all about that
 the ruddy-brown eyes flashed glowed and
 melted you silly boy its high time
 you had some one to take care of you
 but youve no cause to bother miss
  connie ive done nothing

   of course not she scoffed just you
 try though to slip my rope why do
 you suppose i had mr sutton that day
 on the train tell you to ask for work at
 the hat-on

   you you did that

   of course i knew vance would re-
 fuse and i counted on your then coming
 out to us only i didnt foresee the quarrel

 between jack and vance or that i would
 misunderstand what you are

  a killer put in gary

  she clapped her hand over his mouth

  i told you not to be silly and you
neednt think for a minute im going to
let you go back to your frightful dangerous
city life youve settled things here and
youre going to settle here youll be
called upon as deputy for only an occa-
sional shooting-case or rustling or maybe
a bank robbery nothing to compare with
those awful gangs

  deputy its gunman work just the
same

  again the ruddy-brown eyes flashed

  your kind of work-the kind my father
did not gangster killings-not bad-man
gun-play my father was sheriff of this
county he died fighting for law and
order

  gary swallowed the lump in his throat

  well-well then im going to explain
about my knowing how to stack the cards
on austell a sleight-of-hand performer i
happened to do a favor for showed me his
card-tricks and im naturally quick-
handed but i never before dealt crooked
in a game i wouldnt have done it then
if-

  if it hadnt been to help jack and
vance was cheating you broke in connie
you had to do it to save jack from losing
everything by vances dishonesty but
were talking now about our plans next
election youre going to be sheriff as tonto
said unless-

  yes

  unless youd rather stay home all the
time and let me run you as well as the hat-
on

qarys muscles might be weak but they
had lost none of their quickness his
fingers clutched her back-jerking arm

  no you dont you spoke of taking
care of me i need a lot of attention right
now that is i do if youre going to run
me and im going to run for office but
it cant be true connie-dear

  oh cant it i suppose ill have to
prove it to you

  suddenly he felt his head clasped be-
tween her strong little hands the look in
her eyes told him how foolish he had been
to doubt her lips came very close to his
lips

  gary boy youre the man ive been
waiting for all my life
  the

 silent

terror

        by

   edgar
   young

 this man undertook a
 business venture in cen-
 tral america - and ran
 into difficulties both pecul-
 iar and highly exciting

suffice it to say i am a wanderer
with a bit of the neer-do-well in my
make-up farming in the virginia
mountains was so tame that one day i
left-cached away in the possum-belly of
a coke rack on the virginia and southwest-
ern railroad-for the great outside but
the great outside i found was tamer yet
at least so far as the united states was
concerned shop factory office lumber-
jacking ice-cutting harvesting in dakota
glomming hops in oregon tailing up de-
crepit steers in the panhandle-i wearied
of all these and many more and went
roaming off into mexico and those coun-
tries to the south which in my imagination
were pictured as wonderful and romantic
as the fabled lands of the arabian nights

  its a long drill from nogales arizona-
mexico to guaymas and a seven-hundred-
kilometer jaunt to mazatlan from there
the dusty trail winds through smoking vol-
canoes and around giddy precipices to
guadalajara a twelve days hike for a
man with a pack on his back thence
down through the valley of mexico which
is no valley at all but a high plateau
fringed about with snow-clad mountain

ranges and dotted here and there with ex-
tinct volcanoes among which the gaunt
hunch-backed popocatapetl stands like a
white-capped monarch only slightly less
hoary with age are the terraced pyramids
rearing up from the cactus-grown plains

  seven months after i left nogales i ar-
rived in port limon as the crow flies i
had come twelve hundred miles-and as
the typical tropical tramp meanders from
ox-cart road to mule path and indian pack-
track through jungle and along beaches i
had walked at least five hundred miles
more

  i was trail-worn and weary i had a
touch of fever and a touch of the sun
there were saddle-sores on my back where
the sixty-pound pack had ridden and my
shoulders and forehead were raw from the
pack-rope and headband i had no money
my shoes were worn out i was barefoot-
ed and barelegged to the knees where my
faded blue overalls hung in tatters my
jumper was in ribbons my sandy hair
was matted in a thatch on head and neck
for i had given up the luxury of a hat
far back in nicaragua when i swam a rapid
in the upper segovia
the silent terror

thus i arrived in port limon sick
broke partly nutty and with nowhere
to go there was but a bare handful of
thatched huts clustered on the beach for
the united fruit had not yet begun oper-
ations there and the place was a port only
for sailing canoes and small coasting vessels
these huts were occupied by english-speak-
ing negroes runaway slaves from the west
indies-gray-haired old fellows who had
felt the swoosh of the lash in the canefields
of jammokka and bajos and the searing
sun the gnawing vines and biting sawgrass
of the tropical trail they had mated with
stolid indian squaws outcasts from an in-
land tribe and some of their mixed-blood
children-zamboes-grown to manhood
and womanhood had intermarried

  these people treated me with kindness
doctoring my fever with herbs and my
tropical sores with poultices of leaves and
roots in two weeks i was eating roasted
yams fried plantain and fish savory fruits
and coconut milk living to these people
was the simple matter of a few banana
bushes a coffee-tree a hill or two of yams
a few leaning coconut trees back in the
jungle were mangoes aguacotes tree-melons
and whatnot in the sea was fish and
at night great lumbering turtles scrambled
up on the beach to spawn gallons of eggs
in shallow holes in the sand

  but as i recovered my health the old
urge to be moving along took hold of me
i wanted to be on my way though i did
not know where i was going i had heard
that the french were about to begin work
on the panama canal four hundred miles
below i might get a job there then
there was brazil-where i had heard of
gold and diamonds being mined or uru-
guay or argentine where hard-riding
gauchos herded cattle among the bunches
of grass on the llanos the copper mines
of peru the tin mines of bolivia high in
the tops of the andes the nitrate fields of
chile these dim beacons and others heard
of by chance at some time or other set
the wanderlust drumming in my head

  sandal-clad and with clean patched
clothing i hit the beach trail toward the
south one day early and late i traveled
the white hard sand down near the waters
edge until i had put a hundred miles be-
tween me and port limon a certain
thought had found lodgment in my brain
in refutation of the varied lures the wan-
derlust held out whats the use-why
the hurry it wont amount to anything

by edgar young



youd be sick of panama in a week-of
brazil in a day-and youd be heading
north from argentine by the time you hit
there

  it was due partly to this internal battle
and due partly to accident that i went up
the changuenola river plodding along
the beach one afternoon i came across a
canoe which had been tossed up by a wave
and left high and dry when the tide went
out a canoe such as those used by the
coast indians and negroes for taking their
coconuts yams and plantains to the larger
ports for sale

  there was a battered old sea-chest lashed
to rings in the bottom of the canoe up
near the prow and tied shut with a rope
end slashing this fastening and prying
the top open the chest appeared to be full
of hard-packed dry sand but upon tum-
bling it out of the canoe bottom-side up
an ax a cap-and-ball revolver a sealed can
of powder and a small one of caps a hunk
of lead a machete and a demijohn of
aguardiente were disclosed poking about
in the sand i further found a wad of faded
calico a coil of rope a few yards of drill
a pot a skillet and a coconut-shell cup

i floated the canoe by prying first one
end then the other with a piece of
driftwood until i had it in the water then
i loaded in my blanket-roll and the chest
and its contents which i had dusted and
cleaned as best i could using the piece
of driftwood for a paddle i set off south-
ward along the shore hugging it closely
although the caribbean was like glass and
by sundown i came to the mouth of the
changuenola the largest river between li-
mon and bocas del toro the tide was at
the full i paddled the canoe up the river
to the edge of the jungle and dragging it
aground made coffee warmed over the
plantains and yams and other provender
the cimaroons had given me and sat
for a long time over the fire thinking

  the conclusions arrived at that night
were a turning-point in my life the next
morning after breakfast i pointed the ca-
noes nose up the river the jungle growth
was sparse in the sand at the mouth but
soon a growth as dense as a mat walled
either side the river water was murky
and muddy here and there the snout of
an alligator poked up for a moment as i
slid along or the stubby fin of a shark
waved above the water like the hand of
a drowning man farther up the water
the silent terror



the blue

grew clear as crystal and fish of various
colors played around the boat macaws
birds of paradise parrots chattering song-
birds splotched the scene with moving
colors monkeys chattered in the trees

a few more miles and a cool breeze
sucked down from the mountains tem-
pering the air and flinging about the scent
of orchids and flowering vines my eyes
began to rove on either side for a suitable
place to settle i landed several times and
looked about at nightfall i tied up at
the mouth of a little stream that merged
its pristine waters with those of the chan-
guenola in the morning machete in hand
i followed this stream to its source a quar-
ter of a mile inland a great spring gush-
ing from between two jungle-clad hills

  this jungle was not so dense as the low-
land marshy mat tied together with lianas
and vines and wattled with briers and saw-
grass beneath but it was several times more
dense than the thickest forest i had seen
at home by following deer-paths and pec-
cary tracks i cruised about in the woods
all morning and when i returned to where
i had moored the canoe my mind was made
up the timber growth was solid and firm
the berry bushes and briers bore fruit of
luscious freshness the birds flitted from
branch to branch full of life and song i
had turned up dirt in a hundred places-
it was black friable and rich in my hands
my farm training in the hills of virginia
told me this was good ground better land
than any part of florida better even than
any part of california the temperature
was perpetual spring the year around it
would average about  f

  that afternoon i set about to make a
house-one of the easiest things to do in
the tropics i cut four forked poles and
scooping holes with my machete set them
in the ground up in these forks i placed
poles i had cut from these i mounted
two sets of a shaped gable rafters and
surmounted them with a ridgepole the
walls were of saplings the roof of palm-
thatch half a foot thick the doors of short
lengths of bamboo bound together with li-
anas as tough as whipcord using for hinges
two strips of bark

  at one side i built a lean-to roofed with
thatch and with a wall only halfway up
to be used as a kitchen within this i
drove four forked stakes into the ground
and built a platform on top which i cov-
ered with several inches of dirt and clay

this was to build a fire upon to avoid
stooping when cooking my meals i worked
like a beaver from daylight until dark and
in six days i finished house and lean-to
fashioned a rude table and chair swung
my hammock across the room and called
myself at home

  this land was free and still is the only
requirement being to exetcise squatter sov-
ereignty over it as i did for the next
year i worked like a dog urged on by some
trait within me hitherto hidden my
great-grandfather had carved out a home
on wallens creek virginia in the very
early days my granddaddy did the same
at yoakum just across the ridge my
father went across into another valley and
cleared up a homestead it was in my
blood i suppose i cut down trees
slashed brush and burned it gouged holes
in the ground and set out banana bushes
and coffee-trees in regular rows and
prowled through the woods to find young
mango trees to drag home and set out i
made deadfalls and fashioned traps of
tough hardwood

  i wasnt entirely cut off from the world
after a few months the indian women of
the cimaroons had relations up the river
and although they paddled stolidly by with-
out turning their heads either going or com-
ing as is their custom when away from their
men they had observed me and had taken
back word wrinkled old radford buck-
aw rubbing his hands and chuckling deep
in his neck had brought his whole family
to see me one sunday-though i hadnt
known it was sunday until he told me

  the french he told me were working
fast and furious down in panama and trad-
ers were combing the coast for grub i
told him to head a few my way and i
would load their boats to the gunwales
he told me current prices that made me
whistle-coconuts at a real and bananas
four reals a bunch

  the next day i began getting ready for
the traders to arrive i bustled around
merrily thinking of my profits as i piled
up coconuts yams and yampees slashed
down banana bunches and piled them
along the side of the house there was a
cone of cleaned coffee as high as i could
reach and ten feet across at the base in
the house were a number of bales of skins
and hides each one of which i had taken
from the animal staked out and tanned
by hand in the indian fashion-

  at existing prices my stock was worth
book magazine

easily a thousand dollars states money
possibly double that i had about gutted
the farm but if they were paying such
prices i would plant double that much for
future sales prosperity and big money
loomed just ahead i had settled there
seeking only independence-but trade was
finding me out i was a very happy man
when i dozed off to sleep that night

ruring the night i woke up a thing
i rarely do i opened my eyes and
lay there as still as a mouse scarcely
breathing a strange feeling of dread pos-
sessed me cold sweat oozed from my
brow and trickled down upon my face and
nose though i am not given to ungrounded
fears i have slept out on the trail in the
wildest parts of mexico and central amer-
ica and these are not places where timid
persons sleep out alone in this spot i
had lived by myself for over a year a
shaggy individual physically tough a man
to inspire fear rather than to experience it

  i closed my eyes and tried to sleep yet
the fear still clutched me i reared up my
head and peered about not a sound-
not the chirrup of a cricket not the low
muffled whine of a mammy monkey stilling
her babe not the cheep of a bird not the
footfall of a night-prowling animal seeking
my spring the silence was absolute i
had never experienced such a stillness my
hair chilled on my head and i could scarce-
ly breathe

  i groped above my head for the revolver
swinging from the hammock rope rising
to my knees in the hammock and gripping
the pistol with a clutch of steel i peered
intently all about the room a pale star-
light sifted through the cracks and with
my straining eyes i made out the four
corners of the room the table and the
chest-but no intruder of any sort

  thinking perhaps it was something on
the outside staring through the cracks at
me i gave a hoarse nightmarish yell to
startle it into making a movement-then
i would pour lead into it not a sound
answered my shout i gave other shouts
and curses daring it to come in

  i tried to leap up and run outside firing
the pistol but my muscles refused to obey
me some strange atavistic instinct kept
me rooted to the hammock

  perhaps my subconscious mind had
picked up vibrations too highly tuned for
consciousness perhaps sleeping i had
become aware of a slight odor-a mere

by edgar young



trace in the air of an acid gas-that had
aroused biological memories buried by
thousands of years hut yet there in the
germ-plasm

  i stretched out my hand to the palm-oil
dip that swung from the ceiling and feel-
ing under my pillow for flint and tinder
i struck a light and lit the dip the light
blinded me for a moment and i sat there
blinking then i slowly looked around the
room apparently nothing was out of the
ordinary dangling my legs over the ham-
mock edge i chided myself for the fright
yet i did not feel right yet what on
earth was it it was too much for me
and then i saw happening to glance
down toward my feet i yanked them back
frenziedly into the hammock

  the floor was black as ink the floor
was moving where my feet had been a
wave of black rose and then subsided my
eyes bulged out of my head what repul-
sive thing was this crawling below me in
the room i cudgeled my brains as i
scrutinized the flowing mass then peering
more closely i made it out the moving
mass was composed of billions of black in-
sects an inch long and with gaping jaws

  horrified i watched them move by i
remained for hours perched on the ham-
mock fascinated scarcely breathing it
was daybreak before the rear guard passed
through each with a hunk of flesh many
times its own size and weight in its jaws-
the emergency rations for the march when
the last stragglers had passed i clambered
stiffly to the floor and moved about to
ease my stiffened joints then i went to
the door and looked out coming out of
the jungle at the far boundary of my farm
was a clean-mowed street clean as a swept
floor except for the trees and larger sap-
lings small bushes and plants had abso-
lutely vanished before the voracious jaws
of these hunter-ants every living thing
the march had aroused had leaped up only
to fall back amidst the myriads of murder-
ous jaws birds reptiles all small animals
-and large ones too if they happened to
be lying down and were swarmed over be-
fore arising for the ants boiled in a stream
into eyes mouth ears and all natural open-
ings of the body tearing and rending as
they entered eating the animal alive as it
threshed about

i walked around the house gone
were my bananas my coconuts my
yams my coffee-everything that was edi-
the silent terror

ble had vanished i went inside and looked
at the bales of skins-bundles of hair were
all that remained i had not noticed this
during the night every pot and pan was
scraped clean the tin pail i had kept
peccary lard in was as clean and polished
within as if it had been scoured my cab-
in had stood in their path and they had
gutted it-perhaps in some manner they
had sensed it and headed for it sadly i
followed their trail to the rivers edge it
ran smooth as a floor down to the very
water

  had they drowned in the river or had
they crossed it if so how by hanging
to each other and pushing the vanguard
over by traveling under the water the
river was two hundred feet across at this
point and there was considerable current

  i got in my canoe and paddling over to
the opposite shore drifted along close to
the bank looking for the place they had
landed it should have been as plainly
discernible as a street yet i couldnt find
it i drifted along for several hundred
feet scanning the bank closely

  then i happened to glance back over
my shoulder what i saw a few rods away
puzzled me a great ball ten feet in diam-
eter was slowly revolving on the water and
moving steadily toward me i should have
known but i swear at the moment i
thought it was a balloon or some hollow
fungus that had floated out from a swamp
farther up

  a chorus of shrill yells brought me to
my senses and set me to paddling down-
stream furiously a half-dozen canoes hove
into sight and the occupants had taken in
my predicament at a glance old buckaw
in the prow of the leading canoe did not
stop waving his arms and shouting until my
craft turned and lay beside his own

  we rested on our paddles and watched
the ball of ants unmat and wind away into
the forest that was the last i saw of
them although i remained for years in
costa rica i never saw another army of
them

  oh yes i made good buckaw sent one
of his boys back to port limon to fetch
more help and for a fortnight my farm
swarmed with negroes talamanca squaws
and zamboes they cleaned and dug and
set out trees and bushes until my farm
was twice as good as before at the end
of two months i had another crop and
with my produce i filled two sloops that
came up from colon

the

double
shut-out

several years ago i witnessed an
occurrence in baseball that was both
exciting and amusing i was playing
shortstop at the time with the blues in
one of the minor circuits of the south

   jimmy ryan a pitcher new to us that
spring was a long lanky sort of young-
ster with bright red hair and a heavily
freckled face naturally he was an object
of much good-humored chaffing and being
of a bashful nature was continually picked
on by the boys i felt sorry for the kid
and warmed up to him helping him out
all i could for all his awkward ways
ryan was one of the best ball-players that
i have ever seen he was a natural-born
pitcher with an assortment of puzzling
drops and a slow easy side-arm delivery
a scout had picked him up in texas

    the first incident which led up to the
climax of ryans triumph was when stuart
waters a sporting writer on the only news-
paper in the city visited the park to get a
line on the coming team waters was an
excellent sports-writer but was too cocky
at least that was the term which we used
to be a favorite with the boys however
as his paper was the only one representing
the local club he could make the players
eat out of his hand so to speak in order
to get a favorable write-up

    when waters entered the park on that
warm spring day he was walking with
mary denton who was a sort of society
editor on the paper waters in his cock-
sure way had already assumed that she
would eventually marry him and so went
about with her with a proprietary air

i never could see how mary who was a
nice girl could stand a man like waters
perhaps he amused her


by

don
browne

a notably amusing
story of our favorite
national sport base-
ball perhaps you too
could send in a prize-
winning sport story

  well as i said before waters and miss
denton entered the park together she
was leading a pet bulldog a frisky creature
that was always trying to run about and
pull away from his chain benson the
pitcher was a friend of hers and so she
stopped for a little chat with him while
waters strolled over toward the dugout
where ryan was looking over some of the
bats

  i was standing close by and heard
waters say you are ryan our new
pitcher are you not

  the lanky pitcher straightened up his
freckled face reddening and stammered an
affirmative reply waters by nature so
arrogant was amused at ryans embarrass-
ment and asked him several questions
most of them frivolous and some even im-
pertinent

  the reporter at last started back to
where miss denton and the boys were gath-
ered but was suddenly halted by a shrill
cry from the girl oh bobbys loose
catch him stuart hes broken loose from
the chain

  up in front of the grandstand came a
wild aggregation of ball-players the ac-
tive bulldog rejoicing in his unaccustomed
freedom was racing madly over the green
turf his barks drowned out by the
howling mob of ball-players all trying to
catch him for his distressed mistress
waters was running down to meet them

intending to pen the dog between himself
and the boys but just as he reached out
his hands to grab the pup it dodged be-
tween his legs upsetting the immaculate
news-writer in the dust

  it was such an amusing sight that ryan
and i who had remained out of the chase
could not help laughing aloud

  but waters had become infuriated and
jumping up he started after the dog again
close behind him came the crowd of ball-
players all shouting as loud as they could
they were having a good time if waters
wasnt so was the pup who had turned
back to meet them just before he got to
the dugout where we stood the reporter
made a desperate dive and on top of him
landed the boys instantly there was a
twisting mass of arms and legs thrashing
about in the air i thought that the dog
would surely be killed but to my surprise
when i turned around there was ryan
calmly holding him by the collar his
calmness however soon disappeared for
miss denton had arrived by this time her
profuse thanks and compliments to ryan
so confusing him that he could do nothing
but stammer

  you can imagine how waters looked
when he was finally released from under
the pile of players he sure was a sight
and he became more angry when he saw
mary denton so interested in ryan and
paying no attention to him
the double shut-out

  the next day he let off steam on his
sporting page by poking fun at the
blushing young pitcher as he termed
him he really said more than he should
have about young ryan and of course did
not make any friends by it

i

vvhen the season opened a few weeks
 later the blues started out in fine
form after two weeks play we were in
third place ryan had pitched two games
winning both of them his third game
a few days later was the best of all in
it he held the opposing team to one score
the blues winning  to  ryans pitching
was -so impressive and spectacular that at
the end of the game mary denton and
five of her girl friends all climbed over
the box-seat railing and rushed out
through the crowd toward him i knew
that the red-head was bashful but i didnt
know until then just how exceedingly shy
he was when he saw the smiling girls
coming his way and calling his name he
dropped his glove and ran through the
bleachers on into the showers leaving be-
hind him a screaming crowd of enthusiastic
fans

  the following day waters had a sup-
posed-to-be-funny story of the escape of
ryan again he said too many personal
things about the bashful pitcher from
texas it hurt the boys feelings so much
that he came to me that night and begged
me to go with him to waters with a plea
to quit making fun of him i agreed and
going up to the sports-writers office we
put the matter before him now waters
was a pretty good sport-at times-so he
agreed to quit guying ryan through his
columns provided the red-head would
pitch a shut-out game against the bears
the league leaders who had the hardest-hit-
ting club in the circuit

  two weeks later and the last day at
home for a month we were matched with
the league-leading bears if we could win
this game we would be tied for first place
ryan drew the assignment to pitch

  this game i think was one of the most
gruelling that i have ever played or wit-
nessed ryan did the best pitching of
the season his marvelous drop holding the
bears helpless he was fighting for a shut-
out but in the first half of the eighth
something happened the first man up hit
the first ball over for a triple with the
sweat pouring from his forehead the red-
head wound up after turning a warning

by don browne

glance to me the next man grounded to
the box ryan fumbled but as i ran in
to recover he picked up the ball and
sqapped it to the plate the runner
caught between third and home was out
but the other man had reached second
ryan trembling nervously started to wind
up i saw him glance toward the press-
box where waters was sitting with mary
denton she smiled at him and nodded
looking back at ryan i saw his jaw set
and he whipped the ball over the plate like
a bullet strike called the umpire and
two more followed rapidly the last man
up struck three times without success

  as we went to the dugout i saw ryan
glance up at the press-box and smile miss
denton smiled back and nodded hr head
again i noticed waters frowning at this

  in our half of the eighth things started
off as if we would get nowhere the first
two men struck out but big phil wil-
cox our rightfielder connected with one
which went over the left field fence for a
home run you should have heard the
cheering the third man flied out how-
ever leaving us with only one score

  the ninth inning was so short that we
were scarcely in the field before the game
was over ryan only threw eleven balls
over the plate he pitched with a sort of
grim determination and yet he smiled but
he had his shut-out anyhow

that night i was visiting waters in his
office we had hardly begun a conver-
sation about the big game before the door
opened and in walked ryan he stood
with his hat in one hand shifting his feet
nervously but grinning

  hello ryan called waters jovially
you got your shut-out huh well ill
stick to my agreement and give you a real
write-up tomorrow-no funny stuff a
shut-outs a shut-out especially over the
bears

  yep said ryan still grinning a shut-
outs a shut-out i reckon you might call
todays game a double shut-out waters

  how so asked the news-writer

  well you see i got married today-i
shut out the girls regular beau and mar-
ried her

  what laughed waters you mar-
ried well who in the world did you get
up enough spunk to marry

  her name said the grinning pitcher
edging through the door used to be den-
ton-but its ryan now

the may night was clammily hot and
the darkness was relieved only by
the occasional glow of lightning
flaring like distant gun-fire against the sky

  i was halfway down the hill that over-
looks the factory house when in the sud-
den glow of the lightning i saw a big black
dog almost at my feet i took another
step and the dog turning across the road
leaped the old rail fence and disappeared
then it came to me like the touch of a
dead hand that i had seen the dog not
only in the brief flare of lightning but also
in the unrelieved stygian darkness that fol-
lowed

  at this time i was a young schoolteacher
engaged in the preparatory study of medi-
cine so after the fashion of my kind i
explained the occurrence on the ground of
optical illusion or waking dream and did
not think it worthy of mention to any-
one

  summer vacation-time came and passed
in september the re-opening of the village

  school found me again its teacher week-
  ends i always spent with my uncle at the
  old factory house a second home to me

     one gray saturday afternoon in novem-
  ber i started gun in hand for a tramp
  among the raggedjiills at whose base silver
  creek threads its shining way evening
  caught me in unfamiliar surroundings

     suddenly i realized that i did not know
  the points of the compass but trusting to
  luck i struck off through the timber and
  after a time came out on a highway fol-
  lowing which i soon came to a great ram-
  bling old house i turned in to the
  unfenced bramble-filled yard which lay be-
  tween the highway and the house which
  stood weatherworn and forbidding in the
  gathering gloom the thought struck me
  that it was like a grinning evil face the
  tangled yard its foul beard

even as i walked toward the sagging
pillared portico i saw a shadowy something
leap from the shrubbery stalk across the
porch in front of me and rear gigantic

the phantom dog



the blue

against the front door of the house my
blood seemed turning to ice and my heart
clogged-the shadow was clear in the dusk
a great black mongrel dog i realized with
a sensation -of terror that it was the dog i
had seen that night in may on the hill
above the old factory house

  then abruptly the silence was broken by
the shattering roar of a shot and the solid
doors against which the dog was upreared
were gashed and torn by buckshot i
heard a volley of tongue-searing oaths and
beside me gun in hand stood an old man
gnarled and stocky who shrieked at me
through his tangled gray beard who are
you what do you want here did you
see that damn dog

  i answered him as coolly as i could
telling him my name and that i had seen
a dog come out from the brambles and
leap up against the front doors that the
dog seemed to be there when the shot had
struck the door come let us look i
said there must surely be blood-stains
but he replied to my overtures only with
oaths and bade me begone i returned
hastily to the highway and soon found my
way to a little village whence i obtained
conveyance to my uncles home

  the next morning was bright and clear
as my uncle and i sat smoking on the
porch of the old factory house i told him
my odd adventure of the evening before
and for the first time spoke of what i had
seen on the hill above the factory house
the previous spring

  my uncle smoked in silence until i said
uncle is that old man crazy-and am i
touched with the same madness

  he replied no i too have seen that
dog so have a few others weve been
seeing it for more than thirty years up on
mcnaughtens hill where you saw it last
spring and weve also seen it around old
jim crones place there on the eldorado
road

  but said i how could you keep see-
ing the same dog through thirty years of
time no dog lives that long

  i didnt say the dog was living did i
replied my uncle

  then i fairly dragged this story from
him a story i tell in my own words

irty-odd years ago jim crone and
jed parker grew up on neighboring
farms as unlike as two young men could
well be crone was squat broad and pow-
erful with long ape-like arms and bearded

simian face taciturn and sullen in manner
jed parker had the muscled beauty of a
greek athlete fair of hair and with laugh-
ter forever on his lips he was a favorite
wherever neighbors gathered

  these two men were rivals from boy-
hood and at last their rivalry came to a
physical test it happened in this wise
one day jim crone and some companions
of his own kidney were loafing in front
of one of the riverfront saloons at the land-
ing crone was amusing himself and his
companions by torturing a quarter-grown
black mongrel dog the pup was snarling
and whining with rage and fear and strug-
gling vainly to escape from the brawny
grasp of its tormentor jed parker walk-
ing along the street paused a moment and
then with the swoop of a hawk had the
whining pup in his hands there was a
heated exchange of words followed by a
fight that has become a saga of the old
allegheny river wharves in the end jim
crone lay bleeding and helpless in the dust
mouthing threats while his conqueror
walked unsteadily away carrying the whim-
pering black puppy in his arms

then within a year came the great bear
creek oil strike of the early s and a
midas touch turned the bleak allegheny
hills and valleys into gold in the rush
came new faces among them a field su-
perintendent fred holman with his daugh-
ter annie

  again crone and jed parker were rivals
there was competition between these two
as to who should win the favor of the
superintendents daughter it soon became
evident that the sunny face and kindly
ways of jed were winning him the love of
pretty annie holman often they were
seen together in the hills when the arbutus
was in bloom a great black mongrel dog
forever at their heels the dog had but
two friends the man who more than a year
before had rescued him from torture and
the woman that man loved of all others
he was coldly disdainful except when crone
crossed his path-then the dog became a
snarling fiend

  then a great gusher was drilled in on
jim crones farm he became a million-
aire almost overnight

  as the days passed an inexplicable cold-
ness seemed to develop between annie and
jed parker

  soon jed and his black dog dropped out
of sight he had spoken to friends of a
book magazine

proposed journey down into the new oil-
field on thom creek but little heed was
paid to the going or coming of one man in
those hectic days

  less than a year after riches came his
way jim crone married annie holman and
built a great house on his farm but soon
bad luck seemed to pursue -him the wells
he had drilled fell off in their production
and his speculations went wrong from
the day of their wedding his wife began
to fade and fail and before two years were
gone they buried her in the old shiloh
churchyard the huge farm its oil pro-
duction gone became a wilderness crone
now a veritable recluse occupied only a
couple of rooms in the great house which
slowly dropped into a ghostly ruin

ouch was the story my uncle told me as
we sat on the porch of the old factory
house

  and did parker never reappear uncle
i asked

  no he replied it is said he went
down into the kentucky oil-fields but
i dont know theres a mystery about it
that will come to light some day

  but what about the dog i own
that with my question came a chill in my
blood

  the dog replied my uncle has been
seen up on the hill by the old mcnaughten
mine and also around jim crones place
for thirty years-and its a good thing not
to talk about the old man lapsed into
moody silence

  several years passed i returned to the
scene of my pedagogical efforts to hang out
my shingle as a practitioner of medicine
the village had now grown to a flourishing
town my patients however were few
so i made haste to reply when toward the
middle of a may night some one hailed
from the street in front of my office doc
old jim crone up on the eldorado road
is mighty sick and youre wanted

  emergency case in hand i entered the
car with the man but i could gain no
information from him other than that the
neighbors had heard the uneasy lowing of
the milch cows stabled in the barn on in-
vestigating they had found old jim crone
lying on the floor in the hallway of his
home a discharged shotgun beside him
the double doors of the house were riddled
and torn with shot

  they had put him to bed and sent for
me but i found him beyond the reach of

a physicians skill death was a matter of
hours

  the neighbors one by one took their
leave and i was left alone with the old
man who lay propped up in bed in a room
that opened on the front hall of the house

  under the stimulation of drugs my patient
slowly fumbled his way back to conscious-
ness for some time he lay with his burn-
ing eyes fixed upon the open doorway of
the room finally he asked who are
you and what are you doing here

  i answered adding you are very sick
mr crone if there is anyone you would
like to see you had better tell me there
is a neighbor within call

  he muttered dont want anybody
just keep that front door locked will you
i assured him it was closed and was occu-
pied at a table preparing some medicine
when the old man suddenly shrieked
oh doc there he is there he is
dont let that damn dog get me-dont
let him get me

  hastily i turned to the bed the old
man was sitting bolt upright his arms held
up shielding his throat a frozen horror on
his ghastly face his eyes fixed on the open
door whirling about i looked toward
the doorway

  i saw standing there a great black mon-
grel dog its neck ruff lifted and its blazing
eyes fixed upon the figure now crouched
on the tumbled bed i seized a heavy chair
and started toward the sinister shadow of
the dog but the old man moaned pitifully
doctor stay here-dont let him get me
you cant kill him i tried it-i cut his
throat and left him in mcnaughtens mine
when i- god almighty doc hes cornin
for me with a horrible choking gurgle
he collapsed upon the bed

  i hurried to his side-but he had gone
to his final accounting when i turned
again to the doorway it was empty and
the soft spring dawn was stealing in at the

window

  i stopped at the old factory house on
my way home to call upon my uncle now
a very old man the last of his generation
left in the silver creek valley when i
told him the story of the night before he
instantly said get officers and open the
old mine on mcnaughtens hill

  when we had cleared away the entrance
a hundred yards back in one of the old
workings we found the skeleton of a man
the skull crushed-and close by the bones
of a dog

ct december i came to wichita kan-
sas with one definite purpose i was
looking for work it was imperative
that i find a job for i was flat broke

  wichita buzzed with an apparent rush
of prosperity there should be plenty
of work about so i went a-looking two
days later i was still looking for some place
where i might use brain or brawn-mostly
brawn-to earn my daily bread by this
time i had grown desperate a feeling of
close contact linked my stomach to four of
my vertebrae a half-starved look had
cast its shadow on my face i began to feel
that i could devour anything even an
old cart-horse hitched to a delivery wagon
looked appetizing to my eye i had suf-
fered hunger during the war but nothing
compared to this

  i looked about me there must be some
way out-but how i had nothing of
value to pawn there was no work to be
found and my pride would not permit me
to solicit back doors for a hand-out i

tried to find work in some hotel or restau-
rant for my eats but after being turned
away from three or four places discarded
that plan

the evening of my third foodless day i
went down near the union station
my plans were made jail-that was the
idea i chuckled all i had to do was go
out and pick a fight be arrested then
locked up-and fed that was the bright
idea it should be easy to do

  i was passing a hamburger stand on the
corner when gruff voices came from beyond
the door i stopped looked in then en-
tered here was my first chance

  three rough-looking customers clad in
greasy overalls were seated on the stools
beside the counter one glanced sourly
at me as i sat down on a stool at his side

  whatll yuh have asked the cook

  just a second buddy i said i want
to see what the cats drug in your den
-looking at the man beside me
fight like a man



by private anonymous

  the others whirled around facing me
one laughed

  funny i asked looking him in the
eye

  he swallowed a oversized chunk of meat

  uh-huh

  desperately i got off my stool and faced
them the cook gazed at me in astonish-
ment

  i have a treat for you fellows i
bragged then i am going to throw you
out

  they stared at me for a second then
turned and glanced at one another

  this gent i said pointing to the one
nearest me is due for two black eyes-
perhaps more i looked at each one i
have the goods you know

  they glanced at one another again-i
could see they were puzzled

  i stepped nearer the fellow every mo-
ment i expected to be branded the des-
tination for a chunk of meat and bone that
looked more like a ham than a fist

  get up i urged i cant hit a fel-
low when hes down

  he made no move

  come on fight like a man i sneered

  for a second he seemed undecided
then he smiled cheerfully

  no old top i aint gonna battle you-
i got no reason to

  thats right spoke up the other two
you cant pick a fight with us lets go
tom

  they left i heard some of their remarks
as they went out the door drunk no
-dope full of it

  i stalked out of the place baffled but
more determined than ever

  farther uptown at a chilli parlor
beside the city hall i decided to try
my luck again i went inside several
people were there firemen policemen
some in uniform

  i sat down beside a man a few years
older than i later i learned that he was
a detective i ordered a bowl of chili
when it was served i slid it over near his
elbow my scheme was ready for action

  hey gimme that salt i growled

  he turned to me his elbow pushing the
bowl off the counter it colored a circle on
the dry sawdust that was scattered over
the floor

  you clumsy boob i shouted climbing
off my stool for two cents id soak you
one in the kisser

  pardon me sir i admit it was my
fault but please dont be so rude there
are ladies present you see-pointing to
the farther end of the room

  im speaking to you not to the ladies
you big gazook i growled stepping
nearer him come on fight like a manv

  he looked straight into my eyes no
friend i shant do that your anger will
soon leave then you will be sorry he
turned and spoke to a man behind the
counter harry give this gentleman an-
other dish

  he then looked at me again im sorry
sir i hope you enjoy the chili-harry
makes the best in town leaving a bill
on the counter covering the cost of my
chili he went outside

  a few minutes later i wandered across
the street and into the post office a sign
attracted my attention

              join the army
              it makes men

  the bowl of chili had made a home run
with my stomach and my nerves rallied
somewhat for the time being i forgot
that i was broke but the notice in the
post office appealed to me my mind
geared up and memories of good old army
days returned here we were gathered
again a bunch of jolly good fellows wild
reckless full of life-and well fed

  i was now walking down douglas ave-
nue i passed a theater and the ticket girl
smiled at me i returned the smile and
glanced at the billboards

   kansas boys under fire-th division

i went on the army was no place for

  me but with this thought there came
again the realization that i was broke i
turned a corner a man was coming
toward me-here was a chance again

  i bumped into him and he sat down sud-
denly on the sidewalk then reaching over
i grabbed his coat-collar and lifted him
to his feet

  say are you blind i stormed for
two cents id shift you a haymaker

  he gazed at me surprisedly

  come on fight like a man i sneered

a crowd began to gather a policeman
came pushing his way through the crowd

  whats wrong he demanded

  we had a fight i informed him

  any complaints

  i started to concoct a story when my
fight like a man

opponent cut in no officer everything
is all right

  then clear out ordered the cop

  what if i refuse i asked truculently

  to the jug with you then he growled

  here at last was my chance order the
bus old top i smiled

  he fixed his gaze on me for a second or
two grunted and walked away

  i cursed my luck what kind of a town
was this anyway couldnt a fellow get in
jail without a permit

  next morning i re-enlisted in the army

  the sergeant gave me a ticket good for
a meal at the cafe across the street i
rushed down the stairs out of the post
office and straight for said cafe but just
outside i came face to face with the fel-
low i had bumped to the sidewalk the
night before i stepped aside he did
likewise but facing me there was a mean
look in his eyes

  im in a hurry i said made irritable
by the gnawing pains in my stomach

  so was i last night he returned
now well settle it-and go to jail

  i made no move in fact my brain re-
fused to function

  come on fight like a man he hissed
mocking my challenge of the previous night

  i ca-

  he began operations his fist hit me
on the mouth in the eyes on the jaw in
the stomach on the nose in fact every-
where my skill was nil the battle re-
sembled the tactics of a mouse battling
a tomcat

  by this time the police arrived and a
call was sent in for the wagon we were
under arrest several people had gathered
about just then the recruiting sergeant
pushed his way through the crowd he
had witnessed the fight from an office win-
dow above

  officer this man is a soldier i will
be responsible for him

  the policeman thought for a second or
two then he looked at the sergeant a
slight smile on his face

  all right take him away

  the sergeant obeyed back in the office
i told him my troubles and he sent out
for a meal soon i began to feel decidedly
better i laughed until large tears rolled
down my cheeks and even the sergeant
joined in as i related the story of how 
couldnt get what i wanted until after i
didnt want it

  it was a hot august day in canada the
  flowers the rivers the lakes and the
  trees are kept so frozen all through the
  long winter that they seem to say i am
  only allowed to be on display for a short
  time-so i must be at my best and on
  this fourth day of august  the sum-
  mer was at its best

     i was in a small town of about twenty-
  five thousand population the town lay on
  the side of a long rolling hill with a lazy
  river winding its slow way around the foot
  of the hill to the south of this rolling
  land was a small lake shining in the hot
  august sun while in the distance the old
  presbyterian church stood in peaceful si-
  lence against a background of dense woods

     usually everything was quiet and serene
   but on this great fourth day of august
   music could be heard from all over the
   town in the streets were a mass of people
   and flags and bunting floated everywhere
   the street carnival was in full swing the
   air was filled with the laughter of children
   boys were parading the streets and young
   men and girls were dancing this was a
   gathering of all types of people farmers
   bushmen miners indians old and young
   and hundreds of schoolchildren of which
   i was one fun-making had been going on
   for three days this joy was to last a
   week-it was known as the old boys re-
   union all the boys and girls who had
   been born and reared in this quiet town
   were coming home from all countries
   north south east and west

    the merriment was this day at its
height smiling old men were wearing

a great adven-
ture of the great
war set down
with simple sin-
cerity and fine
feeling you will
remember this

paper hats and girls were throwing flowers
when suddenly a dead silence fell over the
throng of happy people what was wrong
people asked one another before an an-
swer could be given a band began playing
god save the king what was wrong

  then through the hush the dread word
passed from one to another england has
declared war on germany people quickly
gathered in small crowds and excited voices
could be heard everywhere

  posters were soon placed in windows and
feeling ran high i had a sensation that
i had never had before i could not ex-
plain just what it was for i was an ameri-
can and my country was not at war it
was not patriotism i discovered at last-
it was adventure

t wanted adventure and adventure

  was always in my mind here was my
chance i would try to go that night i
lay in my bed trying to sleep but with
excitement keeping me awake for hours

at last i fell asleep just how long i had
been sleeping i do not know when i
awoke with a start cold and frightened i
had been dreaming i was a soldier on the
battlefields fighting under the union jack

i could not sleep any more

  in the morning i called for my two
chums and we went to the city hall
flags were flying-not the flags of yester-



day but war flags recruiting posts had
opened and men were in line for half a
mile waiting their turn to enlist-men of
all types willing to serve their king their
country and their flag

  all day i hung around the recruiting
post watching men come out smiling and
shaking hands with one another and saying
that they were willing to go anywhere for
their dear old flag

  that night i asked myself again shall
i join the british army the question
was whether they would accept me for i
was just fourteen years of age but i
would try-i would lie about my age in
order to go

  the next day my turn came after
waiting for hours in the burning sun i
stood at last in front of a large desk it
seemed that all eyes were on me i stood
up straight trying to look as big as possi-
ble i was afraid to speak and before i
could find my voice a tall gray-haired old
captain was at my side he placed his
hand on my shoulder looking me square
in the eye as he said lad you are a
brick it does my old heart good to see
you here we can not take you but may
god bless you for this

  my pulse throbbed i felt hot all over
and a tear rolled down my cheek as i
turned to go when i got to the bottom
of the steps i sat down and cried i could
my buddies

not help it but suddenly i realized what i
was doing-crying and trying to become a
soldier-that would never do

  i turned to see if anybody had seen me
then sneaked away to my room sitting
on the edge of my bed with my head
buried in my hands i thought it over i
could not get it out of my mind i must
go-but they would not take me here
very well i would go some other place
where i was not known

  i packed a small bundle and left that
night going about fifty miles to a city of
sixty thousand people here the next
morning i presented myself at a large
recruiting station at last my turn came
i sat down to fill out my applica-
tion blank and when i came to the ques-
tion how old are you i quickly put
down eighteen years

  from there i went to the medical offices
for an examination and was rejected be-
cause i was half an inch too short and an
inch under standard chest measurement

  i dont know just what i started to say
i was so disappointed but with an effort
i pulled myself together and urged please
let me go surely there is something i can
do the officer looked at me for a full
minute then smiling he said i will on
one condition-that is that you promise
me you will try to develop your chest

  i was so overcome with joy that i ran
to him took his hand and squeezed it with
all my might placing both hands on my
shoulders he added i am letting you go
-but i dont think i should does your
mother know that you have joined well
you wont get any farther than camp for
you will not be able to pass the examination
there but good luck to you and may god
be with you

  outside all those men who have
passed was the first order i heard out-
side i went here were about two hundred
men of all types most of them having
been in the service at some time a tall
sergeant with a big mustache was looking
us over as we came out everybody
seemed to be looking at me i felt that i
was a marked man-some one was going
to recognize me and i would be sent back

  fall in what did that mean what
a harsh voice that sergeant had i saw
the other men lining up two deep so i
did the same making sure to get in the
rear rank so that i should not be seen
when the harsh voice said get up in the
front rank there kid and be quick about

the blue

it dont take all day my heart sank
within me but i could not stop now i
would go through with it at all costs

  quick march before i could realize
what i was doing we had entrained and
were on our way to the training-camp
this pleased me for i loved to travel but
i was amongst strangers i did not know
one of these men but i realized i was one
of them and they were to be my buddies
it is of thee men that i write this story
they were men of all trades and occupa-
tions-bankers lawyers clerks tailors
blacksmiths farmers bushmen and labor-
ers but regardless of their ways they were
my buddies there is not sufficient paper
in the world to write the individual char-
acters and the heroic deeds that these men
performed during the next two years

 amp at last it was a war-time camp
one of those built in two or three days
it consisted of rows of long wooden huts
and it was in one of these huts that i met
my first buddy dear old jack it was the
second day after our arrival in camp all
the boys were out and i had been looking
around the camp returning to my hut
with the intention of shining my buttons
and shoes and going to my cot i sat down
at first i thought there was nobody in
there but me but upon looking over to the
right-hand corner i saw one of the men
sitting on the edge of his cot sewing he
was mending a shirt feeling lonely i
went over and sat down beside him he
did not speak i watched him for a while
trying to think of something to say he
was a big broad-shouldered man about
five feet eleven inches in height with fair
hair blue eyes and a heavy jaw which
showed determination to do anything he
set out to do no matter what the cost
might be

  at last he looked at me his face was
so kind that i said can i mend that
shirt for you

  yes you can he replied

  i took the needle and thread and mended
the shirt so well that he was surprised
and asked me if i was a tailor he spoke
with a broad scotch accent that was like
music to me

  he talked to me for a while about my-
self and then he said where do you
sleep

  i pointed to my cot on the far side of
the house

  come and sleep next to me he said


book magazine



by james duffield

so we carried my cot over beside his
and both went to bed

  soon the men began to come in some
singing some swearing and some drunk

  one of the men who was drunk came
over to my cot and said kid turn out
from those covers and get me some water 
i was scared and did not move taking
hold of the legs of my cot he turned it
over throwing me out on the floor then
he kicked me in the ribs

  in a second jack was out of bed he
grabbed the drunkard by the throat and
threw him heavily to the floor by the
time i got to my feet they were fighting

  never had i seen a fight like this jack
was getting the best of him when all at
once the drunken fellow picked up a heavy
leather belt and swinging it heavily over
his head he brought it down on the side
of jacks face making a deep cut from
which the blood flowed freely before he
could use it again jack with a blow to his
chin knocked him down and some of the
men carried him away

  i looked at jack his face was covered
with blood what could i say i had
only known him about three hours and he
had done this for me at last i went to
him and taking his hand said jack why
did you do this for me you might have
been killed but he smiled and said
thats all right son youre my buddy

  it was then i realized what having a
buddy could mean and as i lay that night
in my cot i thanked god for sending me
a buddy like that i made up my mind
that i would stick by him through thick
and thin

  jack and i slept together ate together
and drilled together in fact we were to-
gether at all times two months passed in
hard training and by this time i was known
in our battalion as the kid eleven
hundred men called me the kid they
were all my buddies and loved me as i
loved them ofttimes on a twenty-mile
route march when i grew tired they would
carry my pack and one would carry my
rifle

pne day i was called to the orderly
room by my captain as i entered
he smiled kindly at me as he always did

  he was a man about forty-five years of
age his hair streaked with gray

  with that kind smile he said my boy
i have been thinking that this is too much
for you dont you think you had better

go home i hate to see you go for i love
you just as though you were my own son
but i thought i would ask you now far
we are sailing in five days what do you
think about it

  i thought a while then replied its too
late now captain i dont want to go
back please let me go with you

  on the fifth day we were on board ship
and i was longing for it to start for fear
they would take me off at the last minute

  the time came to start the whistle
blew the engines throbbed and i felt the
first move of the ship then our band
played god be with you till we meet
again it was not until then that i re-
alized i was going away from home-away
from my mother and loved ones

  i went up on deck and stood there a
while taking my long last look in the
direction of my home i did not feel like
the same boy not even when i recalled
the wharf scene that was one sight i
can never forget-mothers fathers wives
children brothers and sisters sweethearts
and friends crying good-by to their loved
ones women fainted old men cried i
witnessed this but not a soul was there to
bid me good-by

  i sighed deeply and as i took a last look
toward canada i muttered a prayer i
turned to go back to my cabin not the
boy of a few hours ago but a man-at the
age of fourteen i had been hardened in
training and learned the ways of men

i can not take you with me in england
as it would take too long but with the
help of my buddies i finished my training
and during this time grew an inch and
a half however i was still the kid of
the battalion

  while i was sitting in my hut one night
an orderly came in and said the captain
wants to see you my heart dropped
for i knew that i had been found at last
and i feared i would be sent home

  slowly i walked over to the orderly
room there he sat smiling at me
well he said i guess you will have to
leave us son we have a cable from ot-
tawa canada that your mother wants you
home i guess you had better go

  i saluted him captain said i i am
a soldier in your company i am no longer
your boy and i can not stop now i must
go on

  two days later we left england for
france
my buddies

  we were sent at once to stop the german
advance six days and six nights we
fought our captain being promoted to
major

  oh if i could only tell you all about
that wonderful buddy like a father he
shared with me his blankets and his food

  he led us in battle and there was no
place we would not follow day and night
we were always ready to follow him

  jack was always with me and the night
before the main battle he saved my life
all that i have all that i will ever have i
owe to these two buddies of mine

  then came the battle we had been un-
der shell-fire for three days and nights and
in that time we had only two meals which
consisted of canned beef and hard biscuit
nerve-racked hungry thirsty and tired-
all this we were but that line was ours to
hold and hold it we would at all costs
if we died we died for canada

  it was early morning when we went
over the top every man gritting his teeth
and ready to do his part for we were fight-
ing fifteen to one against the pick of the
german army

  all day we held them back by four
p m our ranks had grown thin but we
still held on while our rifles cracked and
our guns roared there came a veil of
smoke was it smoke no it was gas

  men went mad men died but still we
went on jack was by my side when i
heard the ping of a bullet and he fell at
my feet i was down beside him in a min-
ute but the gas came on in green-gray
clouds and we choked after i had passed
through this hell i looked at jack he
lay there very still

  jack my buddy what is wrong

  he did not reply and when the gas had
cleared a little i saw that he was shot
through the face and was dying from the
wound and the gas

by james duffield



  i looked around there lay hundreds of
my buddies dead and dying-some mad
some crawling away they knew not where

  a small band of men came out that
night we had been relieved and out of
those eleven hundred buddies of mine we
totaled two hundred and seventy-three

a fter we rested and had been reen-
forced both physically and in numbers
our major received word to move to an-
other part of the front it was at this
particular place where i saw my major as
i want you to see him always helping
and cheering his men always in front

  we had just taken an old farm and it
was evening moving on to the german
front we found that it was filled with
wounded german soldiers our major put
a bandage on a german soldier and as he
finished and turned to go on to another
this man pulled a pistol from inside his
coat and shot the major in the back as
he fell to the ground i ran to his side
for a minute i could not see

  could it be true that this grand soldier
gentleman father and hero among his men
should be thus treacherously shot

  i knelt down beside him and asked what
i could do for him

  he said son go on-your spirit is
needed then he closed his eyes and was
dead that same dear smile was still on his
kind face as the stars peeped out over-
head i knelt by his dead body and prayed
asking god to make me like him he was
gone-that dear father-buddy of mine

  we went on that night driving the ger-
mans before us strangely my heart was
not heavy with sorrow for they were still
with me one on each side-cheering me
on showing me the way and keeping me
from danger and even to this day they
are still my buddies for in spirit they are
ever with me
